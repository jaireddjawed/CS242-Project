        "text": "I left my ex a week and a half ago and he has somewhat hoovered twice. I was with him for 7ish months and before I ended things, I took about 5 days to truly process and make sure it was the right decision. I got advice from trusted friends, my therapist, and reddit as well. I explained to him for about 3 years the day I ended things why I was ending it. I thought we ended it with an understanding that it was over.\n\n2 days later he called me asking if I'd like to follow up at the end of the month. i explained that no, nothing will change in that amount of time and I don't want to keep holding on. I don't fully trust him and that won't change in a couple of weeks. He understood and we again ended the convo amicably.\n\nWell he was pretty quiet for about a week and then yesterday he called me again. I was actually starting to think, hey maybe he's not a narcissist he really let me go. But nope his call yesterday confirmed it even more. I was having a rough day with something at work and he caught me in a pretty emotional state. I told him I needed about 30 mins to decompress and I'd call him back. He said he was calling to ask me about a position I applied for a couple weeks prior. I ended up calling him back  and I feel like he used my emotions yesterday to tell me he had felt heaviness on his heart all day and that's why he reached out. I told him well no, I was having a good day until about 3pm and he was like \"yeah that's around the time my spirit started to feel this way\" It feels like total manipulation and I'm starting to see through it. Then he was like \"I was so worried about you that I started driving to your house, I've never heard you sound that distressed\" I replied like what? where are you? and he stated he was down the street and asked if he could see me.\n\nBecause I was having such a bad day, I broke and I let him come over. He came to my house so worried about me and caring about how I was feeling (which in our relationship was never how he was lol - he always said basically get over it or try to look at the bright side, he never was comforting or compassionate). I told him that yesterday and he started crying and apologizing. I just felt so numb and cold that I didn't understand what he was doing. I just don't care at this point, but it was pulling at my heart strings and now today it's just bothering me, making me want to reach out to him or comfort him. \n\nWe only spoke for a few minutes and he asked if I'm at peace because he's not, but I've felt at peace with my decision and now I feel confused again. He said he was really growing and learning in our relationship and thought we could make it through anything (he was growing - I was getting smaller I feel like). He then followed me to church after our convo and I just ignored him, walked into church to use the restroom. Then when I walked out, he was just chatting it up with a couple mutual friends. I was so baffled and annoyed. I just walked past him on the other side of the sanctuary. Now today, there is no word from him and complete silence. \n\n**TLDR: my ex boyfriend came to my house crying and apologizing, but then followed me to church and acted like nothing just happened while chatting and laughing with friends. Now today, I haven't heard from him and feel in distress from our interaction yesterday. Was this just a ploy to reel me back in and make me the bad person for not being comforting and caring how he feels?**\n\nprevious post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianmarriage/comments/11gbe6h/struggling\\_with\\_a\\_decision\\_on\\_whether\\_to\\_move/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianmarriage/comments/11gbe6h/struggling_with_a_decision_on_whether_to_move/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

I've noticed this person would change for people all the time for people (music taste, personality, etc.) and the tipping point for me was seeing a tweet about how they enjoyed a music artist that a few days ago they couldn't stand. I got upset and tweeted in my private twitter circle 'Oh great, who are you with now because a few days ago you didn't like \\[Artist\\]'. An hour later, our mutual friend (who I didn't realize was in my twitter circle) messaged me privately about how the tweet made her feel uncomfortable and how she'd be blocking me for the time being. 30 minutes later Nfriend messages me about the tweet she originally had no access to and calls me untrustworthy and how she doesn't deserve this. \n\nMy question is, does that make the friend a flying monkey? I've already gone through the motions and no longer feel like a monster for tweeting about my feelings but I don't know if I should trust this mutual friend anymore\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOTE: I will be speaking to the Nfriend this weekend about my feelings and the tweet.

        "text": "Hi.\n\nI have come far on my healing path, but right now I feel like I'm stuck and maybe even regressing a bit.\n\nMy main issue is that I am still afraid that people will hurt me. I'm afraid they will judge me, reject me, actively hurt me (emotionally and physically).\n\nThis means that I don't ever feel safe. I sleep with the covers over my head, and the tightness in my shoulders is constant and painful to the point where it sometimes produces migraines.\n\nI'm constantly terrified of people hurting me, and I need ideas on what I can do about this. This community is one of the few places I trust enough to bring up this issue.\n\nDetails:\n\nThe short version is that my parents are passive narcissists who never saw me and constantly neglected me in most forms that didn't involve throwing money at the \"problem\". Add some doses of criticism (especially on the few things I was proud about), and yea, my self-esteem was pretty shot.\n\nThen at school, I tried so far to be seen and receive some form of acknowledgement or attention, but I had bullies who took advantage of that and kept pointing me into all the wrong directions that made me the biggest troublemaker the school had ever seen, and I could never shake that reputation and the prejudice that came from it all as well as the resulting mockery, finger pointing, and harassment.\n\nThings started to change when I left my parents' home to study, and then I was lucky enough to find my soul mate who has way too many similar experiences for it to be coincidence. We've been married for 20 years.\n\nAfter a few years together, we suddenly recognized her mother to be a full-blown malignant narcissist and started working on things on our own. Still years later, we found a good therapist who helped unravel things more, and pretty much my wife's entire family consists of abusers (with one exception). Then we came to talk about me and my parents... well, see above.\n\nI've done well on the acceptance part and the emotional distance from my family. I've done inner child work where I interact with a younger version of myself inside my head to teach him, love him, and let him know he is safe, and he is doing much better these days.\n\nI'm also on a path that allows me to believe in myself more and more. I'm able to acknowledge accomplishments and take more pride in them.\n\nAnd yet, I have developed a ridiculous amount of paranoia - I'm expecting people to hurt me (like they did back then) even though I have not had this experience for 20+ years.\n\nAnd yet, when there is trouble, I generally don't seize up - my mind typically stays sharp and able to think my way through (even though a bit slower sometimes than normal).\n\nMaybe despite all my growth in self-esteem, I have never been fully tested on whether or not I can truly take care of myself if I was attacked for real. Sometimes while falling asleep, I will run scenarios in my head on how I could act if a burglar showed up at our house or someone with a knife/gun were to rob me on the street. Lately, I've been having some bizarre dreams with people acting more and more irrationally and rudely in my direction, and I typically wake up before a resolution - I tend to \"continue\" the dream while awake and try to take control to get a positive outcome to happen.\n\nI guess with all the dress rehearsals in my mind, I still don't believe that when the time comes, I CAN defend myself.\n\nI stay off news as much as I can, but some things you can't help noticing, and there seems to be a trend of people running amok more and more in the last few years. It scares me.\n\nAnd then there are the few people I love. I am also mortally afraid of accidentally hurting them or disappointing them as well as them hurting me (mostly by accident). I'm afraid of losing them through something stupid I might do - which again would result in me getting hurt by their leaving.\n\nSo ... what are your thoughts on how I can get over this fear of getting hurt?\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "TW: MENTIONS EMOTIONAL ABUSE\n\nI (25F) have been in a long distance relationship ship with my boyfriend (26M) for two years. We dated in person for 6 months before he had to move for work. I love this man so much. He has loved me at my absolute worst and I have loved him at his. We have open communication, the sex is great, and we are committed. \n\nDespite everything I have mentioned sometime I this nagging feeling to text my ex who wasn't the source of my ptsd but he definitely made it worse. I was in the beginning stages of my paranoia turning into psychosis (dissasociating episodes). I didn't realize it at the time but I let him degrade, gaslight, manipulate, and have complete control over me. I was basically his doormat. One day he made a comment about how he thought I would look good with a boob job and something finally clicked. I got upset with him and told him he was an asshole. This led down a rabbit hole and in the middle of the argument he ghosted me. It felt like the end of the world as my mental health  declined further. I lost my job, apartment, and quite literally, my sanity.\n\nEventually I started getting proffessional help and I thought I found some closure to move on. Getting back on my feet I met my boyfriend who I  steadily began to date and fell in love with. Since I started dating my new bf I have changed my phone number but my ex still finds ways to dm me from random accounts and somehow has my new number. When my ex \"pops up\" its like everything I have built to protect myself and heal withers away and I become engulfed in panic and rage. The worst part is I know somewhere deep down I feel like I want him to validate me even if it means he berates and belittles me.\n\nI opened up about all of this with my now boyfriend. He understands as he had a similar relationship in the past and we mutually agreed the best course of action was to ignore his calls to get my attention. It's been about a year since this decision was made but from time to time I still get his messages. \n\nRecently I find myself picking fights with my boyfriend and I think it's because I want him to treat me like shit. I've opened up about this with him and we are going to therapy as a couple. What he doesn't know is when he doesn't respond as an asshole to me sometimes I find him unattractive and resent him. I'm not proud of harboring this feeling, especially since we have a very transparent relationship. I completely detach and when I can feel emotion again I feel very depressed and ashamed. \n\n\nOutside of the issue we have a modestly healthy relationship. (I say modestly because the issue significantly effects our relationship). I just needed a place to tell the whole truth because the guilt has been eating at me.",

A number of other coworkers have discussed the same concerns with me.  I brought up the concerns in a smaller venue, and it was suggested I discuss it at a larger meeting with more providers.   I am one of the primary people who service this individual.  I have almost 28 years of experience working with this population. \n\n I began speaking and was questioned at every turn and treated like I did not know what I was talking about by 3 people in this meeting. There were 13 people, total  in the meeting from various departments.  I was put on the defensive and began feeling like I was crazy and didn't know what I was talking about.   The other 10 people did not say anything.  I felt like I needed to say, multiple times, that numerous other people had voiced the same concerns, and at least 3 other people wrote reports about the same issue.  I could feel myself getting upset and felt like I struggled to remain professional.  In the end, 1 minor change was made that would be of little consequence and is not likely to help the individual.  \n\nToday,  I spoke to another individual who was in the meeting.  He said he was disgusted at the outcome of the meeting and the way I was treated.  I told him that I felt like I was being gaslighted during the meeting.  He agreed and stated he did not understand why no one said anything or why the outcome was what it was.\n\nBecause of my trauma, I had to ask him if I handled myself ok, if I was professional, and if I was acting appropriately (because I was really upset and had tunnel vision at one point).  I thought I was potentially coming across as a raving lunatic.  He assured me I was professional and appeared serious about the issue but not overly emotional. \n\nI went home mentally and physically exhausted.  I fell asleep at 6:30.  I woke up later and couldn't sleep for hours.  I honestly felt like quitting.  I'm sad and angry about so many things surrounding this meeting.  I felt like I was retraumatized at work.  \n\n  I always try to fight for the safety and well-being of my clients. But, I  will never go to this meeting again.  It is not a mandatory part of my job.  Sleepless nights, anxiety, and flashbacks are not worth it.  I will find other ways to advocate for my clients. \n\nThanks for the vent!",

        "text": "  \n\nToday I want to talk about how to stop ruminating and why we ruminate on folks with Cluster Bs. We ruminate because we want validation, if they are happy does it mean it was my fault. We ruminate because we want answers. Those two things are valid however, you are not going to get answers to your questions from a CB for a few reasons, \n\nThings you will not get answers for and why.\n\n1) Phrases like I am not enough. Why was not I enough? This phrase can be looked at as a personal failure, however, if you REALLY stupid CB than you will know the answer, No you are not enough , neither is the next person and the next person ,etc . They are so scared of love , missing out on their soul mate, they act impulsive, Jumping relationship to relationship, this is an internal problem they have and no way shape or form reflective of you \n\n2) What could I have done differently ,could I have fought less, given them more attention, more sex. Etc.The truth you could not have done anything differently, They always want more.\n\n3) Did they care about me. They care about the mask and their image. Now the tricky part, this ties into their ego . Some may really care about you but you will never know. Instead of owning their shame and insecurity, and their abusive behavior, a lot of them may care about you but instead of looking inward they will either blameshift you for the demise of the relationship or they will gaslight themselves that they deserve better.Owning their real feelings especially if it means dealing with shame , and accountability is to much for them. \n\n4) Why I am not good enough and the new supply is? A lot of you wonder that and I get it. However, Many sentiments wrong with this statement. First of all the CB has you in a competition with someone that you do not know. A lot of times the new supply is just as in the dark as you are. \n\nThat was the Why , now I want to move on to how to get unstuck. \n\n1) The first reason why we get stuck is this , when we ruminate we are actually missing the mask. Or the person that they pretended to be not who they are. A lot of people are like no me, than let me ask you this, when you are missing the abuser are you making excuses for their toxic behaviors or some how justifying it. Or ignoring it . If you are this proof that you are missing the mask. \n\n2) No one wants to accept that they are un a relationship with a CB.\n\n3) You believe the lies, and the show that goes along with the protection of the mask. The new supply and them seem so happy.",

        "text": "So here I am, over a year and a half later with no contact to my ex narc. I was for a short time in therapy, got back to work and my studies. This is how I kept my mind sane after all this - and believe me, there were times when I panicked and felt the painful urge to meet him because my body was in a sort of \"surviving mode\", my body/mind was shaking and it felt like going through hell and back but here we are.. better than ever without their mind games.\n\nJust to sum up of who we are talking about.. it went from blaming me that I am a \"whore\" because I was talking to other people (literally just small talk) to ignoring me for no reason and being physically violent because he didnt want me to go when he made me cry up to the point where he told me Im too sensible and didnt let me sleep until 3/4 am when he knew I had to go to work the next day (if I went sleep earlier he would go with the silent treatment). He told me that I am boring and that my answers are \"not enough\" when I didnt write back fast enough. It stressed me out so much. When I wanted to discuss a problem he was holding his ears and smiled. He even whistled while doing so. At the very beginning he cried and told me it was not his fault, his ex girlfriends were all evil. And it was obviously their fault that they \"cheated\" and all this stuff. I wanted to leave him earlier but he threatened me with suicide multiple times. So I stayed because I was afraid that he would really do this. He was also weirdly obsessed from the beginning to get me pregnant as soon as possible and was talking every week about it and touching my belly. And when I was done with him at the end he was shouting at me and telling me stuff like I destroyed \"his dream\" and \"our daughter\" and its all my fault. \nAlso he was weirdly obsessed with the thought that I cheat on him. So when we had sex he was completely in rage when I showered after because he thought I would want to \"erase any evidence\". \n\nWell.. I am really really happy and thankful that I got over him and that I am in a safe and peaceful place now with my studies and work. Nevertheless I developed a strange habit because he used to block and unblock me many many times to \"reward\" or \"punish\" me so I was randomly looking at my block list two days ago or so and realized that he unblocked me. And I wonder like why after a year and a half of no contact? He's definitely staying on my block list but can someone explain?\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "text": "I have my first appointment Monday. Do I need to just go in there and lay it down and say here's what happened and I'm pretty sure I was a victim of narcissistic abuse? I'm worried I won't really be taken seriously. I still doubt the severity of the emotional abuse and have opened up to complete strangers who asked to get a gauge on it. Sure enough even strangers say yeah you were abused. I'm worried about not being taken seriously in therapy because my relationship was 1. Long distance granted we saw each other but the majority of it was phone calls, video calls and texts which honestly added to that isolation alone feeling. And 2. I'm a man and we all know how seriously society takes men being abused. And 3. This was my second \"adult\" relationship (I'm 24) and both this and the last one were abusive. Funny enough is one hurts worse than the previous one that was longer, I was emotionally, physically abused and I was also guilt tripped into sex, so I'm going in order to work through both of these and hopefully get healed and be able to attract a decent partner who isn't abusive. \n\nI also am trying to fix my rescuer tendencies. Both these relationships the common thread that drew me in. Both women came from horrible back stories and childhoods that drew me in and I let trying to be considerate of their past and knowing that Trauma can cause issues to arise turn me into a doormat. My needs weren't met. My First ex I'm not sure if she's a narcissist, my mom seemed to think so. This second one fits the bill from everything I've watched and read from here. I have a need to be needed and I'm not sure why. I have some theories on why. I also try to help others feel better when they're down. If someone tells me a sob story I'm quick to believe it and offer support. Thats what got me roped into this past relationship and what made me stay in both of the relationships I've been in. I was too guilty to leave. In the first one I ended up getting fed up and leaving and that got me stalked for years off and on and the left over trauma from that relationship seemed to lead down the path of this one. I had been single for years and when I met her the charm and lovebombing mixed with her sob story of how life has treated her badly made me go \"Oh I want to fix her and help her\" it's like a reflex with me. Someone is in pain my reflex is automatically almost subconsciously \"how can I help?\" It's a quality I've always seen as good. I think helping people and being there for people is good, but it's gotten me burned quite a bit now and I often put others needs at my own expense. I can't say no. I have weak boundary setting skills. This past relationship Is the only time I've really set strong boundaries and that wasn't until late in the relationship and it got be discarded and put through some of the worst pain I've felt. Which I mean I'm glad I was discarded, I don't want someone like that in my life. \n\n\nSorry for the rant everyone. This is the only place that I feel comfortable putting my thoughts out there and hopefully putting this out there  will help others",

But her financial abuse was the cherry on top. \n\nShe wouldn’t allow a divorce years ago or for the last 6 months of last year, but as soon as I caught her cheating she wanted a divorce and she wanted it NOW, because she’s a narc and she only cares about herself. \n\nWe had agreed on a no contest divorce, she took the money she wanted, let me back into the banks, and said “the rest is yours”, but kept taking money, charging credit cards etc. \n\nI got a lawyer and had a very expensive consultation which of course did nothing. I complied all the debt she owed that she spent since we physically separated, and since legal separation and it’s in the 10s of thousands. \n\nI reminded her that she didn’t want to drag it out in court and if she did here’s the proof and you’ll be saddled with the debt. \n\nShe actually agreed to take on her debt, repay the debt owed (I don’t believe her for a second but if a court orders her she has no choice), and I’ll handle the debt that I was already paying and considered fair. \n\nI’m waiting to hear back from my lawyer if I can make the email a legal and binding agreement in court so I can continue this without a lawyer. \n\nWe both want it over and done with. She’s trying to make me feel guilty, and she claims “she’s so sorry”. Crocodile tears. \n\nI’m hoping this is a rare win over a narcissist. I how this upholds in court. I hope the judge sees through the lies and BS and actually delivers justice. \n\nI’m not holding my breath, I’m not getting my hopes up too high. \n\nBut I’d love to finally have a win.",

        "text": "  \n\nToday I want to talk about my journey of healing as well as some of the mistakes that I have made. The first thing I want to say is this, healing from these things is tricky and hard. Its also important to retain these lessons to prevent future Cluster B relationships, Prior to my relationships (my dad and my ex) I was a hot mess. Co dependent, and I had some of the poor boundaries, You love me great feel free to walk all over me. \n\nI was with my Ex for a yr, stalked for four months, during the four months that I was stalked , I was dealing with the dying and death of my father who was on the cluster b spectrum as well. I am happy today and more relaxed, April 4 is my birthday, my last birthday I was a hot mess, I remember crying on vacation and crying for some of the weirdest reasons, Oh that person is being nice to me, I cried, That person took off his covid mask to talk to me I cried. \n\nIf I had to pick one word to describe my mind set , that word would be greatful. I know a lot of you are like WTF. The abuse was not fun and I would not want to go through that again, It is the lessons that I learned from abuse that I am greatful for. \n\nIts not easy, and sometimes I wanted to give up, When you spend your whole life putting others above yourself , when you finally place more value on yourself, some will be like about damn time, others will be like WTF, the people that love you will work with you , the ones that do not because they cant walk all over you will lash out, I cant recall how many times I have been called the B word by family members, The old me would have cared , the new me is like better to be a healthy and happy bitch than miserable doormat. \n\nThere have been some people that I have cut out of my life, do I feel guilty about that ? No because you have to look at your intentions, do you pick your well being or some one who has interests other than you and may be not reciprocate your feelings or reciprocate your investments, \n\nThere are some people that I cant walk away from , and those, I either put my foot down or I walk away from the situation. Again , your health and peace of mind is really important, Do not try and fight someone who will discard your happiness for their own.\n\nDuring the yr that I was with my Ex, I hid my feelings , I took my pain out on my body and over indulged in poor eating , I have stopped that now , I exercise more . Yoga and meditate. \n\nWhen you leave someone be it family member or romantic partner, do not chase them. If there is real love there , they will find you , they will make amends, if they do not or they want to blame you , gaslight you , that is not love . Its not real love if you are doing the chasing , if you have to beg for answers. Them not providing you with answers is Not on you and further more proof of them not loving or respecting you. \n\nIn terms of romance , people fall out of love, change their mind ,that is normal and part of life, However , its not normal mind relationship, if someone does that it is for two reasons, Control . Control what they can and cant get away with. The other is denial about their real feelings, One of the most disrespectful things my Ex did to me, was post break up . He paid a Only fans sex worker money to flirt with me. It may have been about control or denial .Regardless , when it is post breakup, you can still find disrespectful but also validating, that if they have to announce they have a new type post breakup, let that serve as validation that they were not the one for you.\n\nFinally , thanks to therapy , and tons of self help videos on a whole slew of subjects, All in the name of seeking answers and understanding, I have spent the last couple of months, trying to help people on redit but more importantly, living my life , Not for anyone else, but for me. Chasing my dreams, going on vacation be it places like Egypt or attending writers books signings out of town. The point healing is hard, but until you choose yourself over them , face the pain , embrace the hurt , start to change , you will never be happy. Your happiness is so important.",

They often culminate in financial ruin, emotional devastation, physical illness, even death. They can terminate as precipitously as they started or span over many decades. **Their length is dependent on how useful you are to the narcissist and how much psychological abuse you can tolerate**. \n\nIn some cases, the partner of a narcissist has become too ill psychologically or physically to withstand the association any longer. The narcissist effortlessly replaces those who are worn and tired with a fresh face, a bright-eyed adoring disciple.\"\n\nSo there you have it. \n\nTry and stop torturing yourself over the \"whys\". It's nothing personal. Narcs are incapable of seeing others as independent living and breathing human beings with their own needs, who are worthy of consideration and respect. In their eyes, we are just objects that serve a function. Totally replaceable. As Sam Vaknin puts it, we are their (in)significant others. A hard pill to swallow, but the truth nonetheless.",

        "text": "How could you possibly miss this person so much?\n\nThey have no long term plans. To make you feel influential, they put the burden of their happiness on you: to steer the relationship, to keep them happy in all senses of the word, to keep them faithful, to reparent them, to teach them how to act/behave appropriately (even if they just learn to fake it better).\n\nThey internalize nothing. All that work you did to help them go to the doctor, start a healthy diet, explain to them why certain things are -isms, encourage them to recycle, etc. all goes out the window when you’re over (or they fake it long enough to bag the next supply). Any “work” they do that sticks is external and is for supply. They largely don’t care about being a better person. It’s why they never stick with therapy. They have no higher values except serving themselves.\n\nThey have no real friends. The only people who tolerate them are flying monkeys, enablers, and other narcs who only wish they uphold one another’s fragile image. Anyone real who gets close enough to them to see them knows them. \n\nThey have no identity. They don’t know who they are. They are a collection of styles, interests, hobbies, tastes, home decor, dress, and manner of speech that has been taken from their family, subculture, media, and their former supplies. They don’t know themselves and they hate themselves so much that they don’t care to learn themselves. \n\nThey have no purpose. Since they have no identity or values, they don’t know who they are or what they deeply need, so they have no internal drive to acquire or achieve anything truly meaningful. They only know what they want in the short term and how to imitate others and be reactive. \n\nYou miss a false dream. You miss hope for what you wrongly thought could have been. You miss a mirror placed in front of an empty pit of chaos, reflecting your hopes, dreams, values, and interests back onto you. You miss a skilled actor. You miss a child in an adult meat suit, with adult privilege. You miss a fake human. You miss a soulless vessel who is out there making the world a worse place. \n\nYou really miss who you were before they got to you. You miss trusting people and believing most people are good. You miss hope. You miss trusting yourself. You miss your voice and your spirit. \n\nIt will come back. You won’t be the same, but believe it gets better. ❤️‍🩹",

The next day I reached out to him and he said “I can’t text when I’m at work.” Bullshit, that had never once been an issue before. \nHe also stated he lied because he feared my reactions. Yes, I did get very emotion, but that’s because he would push me to that point. I am actually a very easy going person, I don’t have this issue with anyone else in my life, so I KNOW it’s him. \nThen I reached out to him and he said “every time my phone buzzes, I worry it’s you texting me with another thing I have to atone for.” The audacity. Maybe don’t do thing you have to atone for? It’s insane how far they’ll go to blame us. Of course at the time that did make me feel guilty. \nThen he flipped it around and said I never did anything wrong, it was all him, I’m perfect, it always had to be me.

        "text": "Hi everyone, basically I'm wondering what kind of advice to give to my sibling.\nShe is trying to break up with her boyfriend who is let's put it down bluntly asshole and is a narc. \n\nAs of rescently they've been going out for a year. He is old and has a teenager son. They meet at work and at the time my sister was the manager. He pretty much love bomb her and was very all over top of her and wanted to see our parents etc..However once he meet them that was it he wasn't interested. \nHowever my sister HAD to see his family. \n\nHe never come to any family gatherings. \n\nHe has a werid realtionship with his ex partner who she is married and has two sons with her current husband and one son with the narc that my sister is currently trying to break up with. They live overseas but the son rescently came over. \n\nBasically the boyfriend left his work because he wasn't happy with the payment he was getting, he realised the company he was working for was terrible and apparently didn't know what they were doing. My sister felt responabile and worked hard to get his job back with a pay rise. \nWell he got the job back and he would now and then write his works hours he didn't do, my sister caught him out on this. His excuse was \"you know how hard I work\". \n\nWhen my sister tells me they \"hang out\". \nHe just plays on my sister's playstation hours on end and I mean to the evening without talking to her. If she tries to say hey we aren't hanging out or you are playing too much playstation he tells her she is clingy and needs alot of attention and how this is related to her dad leaving as a child. As my sister puts he psycho analyses her. \n\nIt ends up going no where or he gets the huff and leaves to go home back to where lives his mum and dad. Because you know he is 45 and still lives at home. \n\nMy sister second guess herself and wonders of she is clingy I tell her no, he doesn't know how a normal realtionship works..\n\nAt times she is confused. \nFor example for the confusing part. He left the job that my sister work hard to get to go back to pursing his \"acting career\". \nHe is just a extra for some film set for 6 months none thing big. My sister described how he told her he has to drop his ego for the big main actor of the film set. The actor is actually Aqua Man dude. \nIt's like what? you not even at that level dude. \n\nI've done extra work so I told my sister it's not a big thing and he be mainly sitting and waiting to be called on scene. \n\nAnyway, she only seen him for twice in Feb and when she called him because he didn't contacted her for 3 weeks! he only gave her a 5 min talk and said he needed to go back to his extra friends because they gonna have some event for the extras..\n\nNow the narc boyfriend has been kicked out of home. Because the house was for sale and his parents well I guess weren't orgainsed and didn't bother to find a home once the new owners came in. So they've moved in some family home and narc boyfriend moved at his friends with his son. By the way the boyfriend knew they move out way back in January. \nSo he could've orgainsed himself. \n\nOkay now to the present. \nBasically boyfriend told my sister he is thinking to be stripper 🙄 and my sister if you do this I'm not going to be with you..He didn't replied back to her, so she called him at the evening. She said this isn't going to work out and he said as she described very matter of fact \"Well you got to do what you need to do\". \nMy sister was heart broken as she said there was no emotion on his side. \n\nHe told her he had to pick up his son from foot ball and get some trailer. But seriously it doesn't take much effort to send a txt. \nAnyway he told her she is clingy and needs alot of attention and that she doesn't take responsibility. \nWhich is like hang on dude, you live at your friends now and didn't take responsibility for yourself and now you want to be stripper?! he reckons it's gonna be his way to acting. lol. \n\n anyway my sister rang me crying and she said she doesn't know to break up with him tonight or the weekend. She said how she has to do some job interviews for tomrrow at work and it be hard you know keep a straight face when your upset. \nBut she says she be upset for 3 days and then gives in at Saturday and won't break up with him. She reckons if she sees him that some how he will show love to her but he won't. \n\nI've offer to see her stay the night when she breaks up with him etc. \n\nIs there any advice to help my sister to break it off with this crazy narc that's a wannabe actor?",

        "text": "I am 7 months out and around the same time no contact and the last week the feeling of missing him is excruciating.\n\nI know he was not good for me, he has said things that really hurt me, but the past days I get doubts.\nIs he really a narcissist or just an asshole?\n\nHe emotionally neglected me, that is for sure. I needed his support after my father's and dog's passing in a time span of 6 months, but I didn't get it. \nI was a wreck, but he told me to push through and I was stupid enough to listen. The consequence of it was that I never properly mourned.\n\nWork was more important then our relationship and that hurt me. I was sad and unhappy with him so I am glad I ended it, but why does it hurt so much to be away from him.\n\nI am doing better, but the fact that not even 3 months in he already had someone new nauseated me. I really loved him and it hurts and breaks me that apparently I just was a dirty towel to him that he could throw away.\n\nBut still I ask myself, is he a (neglectful) narcissist or just an asshole with no sympathy.\n\nAnd at the same time I am so angry.\n\nHas someone any advise or insights for me?\n\nThank you in advance!",

        "text": "Tldr: my ex tried to guilt trip me for seeing a friend after an unsuccessful unalive attempt. He took screenshots of  my Facebook story from a burner account and is using it against me to hurt me even more. \n\nJust a little backstory: we'd  been trying to break it off for 2 weeks since our relationship had become toxic and abusive (sometimes physical on his end). After our Iast blowout  I had a unalive attempt due to the intense pain and drama. He was the one that called the police and my mom to make sure I was ok but after still acted distant and said he wanted to break up. I accepted it.  I managed to avoid getting locked up in inpatient and as soon as i got out the hospital i went to my friend's party because I had flaked on her 3 times already due to having mental health issues in this relationship and she's the only friend i have left. I was only at the party an hour and drank water because i was exhausted and drowsy. I took a picture with her holding a glass of water and posted it to my fb story.  He screenshoted my Facebook story (he has me blocked on fb but watches me on other accounts) with her and sent it to me with a text accusing me of faking my unalive attempt and being reckless and toxic.  All of this because I chose not to take his calls since i was exhausted and didn't want to fight after i came home that night. I promised myself I wouldn't respond to him anymore but that assassination of my character riled me up and I just told him he's completely wrong and to no longer contact me.  I feel guilty for reacting, but maybe I shouldn't have gone  to a party after  that whole ordeal? I know it didn't look the best but if he would've asked I could've told him I've didn't stay long nor drink and I've been in bed ever since.",

I'm sad to see she will probably learn his true character the hard way. regardless, I've been trying not to think about that situation since I warned her. however, a few days ago, me and my two friends went on a trip over spring break. the new girlfriend is still following one of my friends on Instagram, where she liked and commented on my friend's post, saying we were all adorable.\n\nI have blocked her (and my nex) on all platforms. one of my friends has done the same. the friend with the Instagram post deleted her comment. surely, she must realize we don't want to interact with anyone who associates with my nex? I can't tell if she's interacting to try and be friendly, or if she also has bad intentions like my nex.\n\nI put up with a lot from my nex. he was misogynistic, ableist, and sometimes racist. he was rude, he interrupted people, and he constantly littered. he was a kleptomaniac. yet, had a woman approached me and shared how he abused her, I would like to think I would have believed this hypothetical woman and left him -- especially if she was a woman I had known. I worked with his new girlfriend for a year, and we had several classes together. I thought very highly of her. I'm not sure if I do anymore, and I'm not sure if that's hypocritical of me to say.",

I couldn't even feel sympathy for her because that was LOW.\n\nI kept a diary of 'odd' things.  Things that were not making sense in our relationship and as I felt the tension building up I felt the need to document the insanity that I was being put through.  We went to therapy at the end, and they lied to the therapist about wanting a child, they desperately wanted a child but lied to the therapist in front of me.  That was the end for me. \n\nI was able to restart my life in a way, but I still haven't 'found myself' again.  This may seem bleak but I'm almost 3 years from no contact and I have not looked for a new relationship, I sorta feel like I need to let it organically happen instead of searching for it.  I always have a mentality about finding someone, and it's the same for a lego piece, \"You always find the one you're looking for when you're not looking for it\".\n\nAs I write this I was informed recently that she is pregnant at 40 and all I can think is \"I feel sorry for that guy\" and \"I dodged a MUCH larger bullet!\"\n\nAnyhow, if you read this... thanks.  I wish you luck in your post-Nex world and stay strong, there are good people out there so I'm told!\n\n\nHere are some audiobooks that really helped me figure out that I'm living in a crazy made-up world, I hope they can help you too!  \n\n[Should I Stay or Should I Go](https://www.audible.com/pd/Should-I-Stay-or-Should-I-Go-Audiobook/B018H9EDEE?ref=a_account_p_c1_order_detail_pdp&amp;pf_rd_p=be5880e8-6386-440e-a7af-e00fdf352b08&amp;pf_rd_r=J7TYB0EYZHYSQ2P1T5QM&amp;pageLoadId=v0RvI89Ayga5OIoY&amp;creativeId=9653015a-0975-4d29-a2f4-52c96d320026)\n\n[Power: Surviving &amp; Thriving After Narcissistic Abuse](https://www.audible.com/pd/Power-Audiobook/B073XPHFM2?ref=a_account_p_c1_order_detail_pdp&amp;pf_rd_p=be5880e8-6386-440e-a7af-e00fdf352b08&amp;pf_rd_r=J7TYB0EYZHYSQ2P1T5QM&amp;pageLoadId=v0RvI89Ayga5OIoY&amp;creativeId=9653015a-0975-4d29-a2f4-52c96d320026)\n\n[Becoming the Narcissists Nightmare](https://www.audible.com/pd/Becoming-the-Narcissists-Nightmare-Audiobook/B01M9JRUAD?ref=a_account_p_c1_order_detail_pdp&amp;pf_rd_p=be5880e8-6386-440e-a7af-e00fdf352b08&amp;pf_rd_r=J7TYB0EYZHYSQ2P1T5QM&amp;pageLoadId=v0RvI89Ayga5OIoY&amp;creativeId=9653015a-0975-4d29-a2f4-52c96d320026)",

How do you decide which friends are close enough and trustworthy enough to be part of the surrogate family you are constructing? How do you ensure that in the state of vulnerability and loneliness that characterises awakening from narcissistic abuse you don't grab at straws and replace an unhealthy family dynamic with bad friends?\n\nI have more questions but I hope that makes what I'm trying to get at clear",

        "text": "I have some specific things that my abuser would put me down and belittle me. In the beginning it was never a big deal, over time he began saying none of his friend's wives drove, only I drive among his known circles.. (extremely  weird,  his cousin sister drives as well, so I don't know where this I don't know indian women who drive comes from) .\n\n\nBut later he met with an accident, he was safe but needed a new car. He would keep boasting how his new car was so good and everyone was praising it. (He badly needed appreciation and validation). His new car was a second hand Honda city which apparently is a big deal in india. \n\nI have a budget car which I got myself (suzuki) and my parents had luxury cars so I have driven them occasionally.  I'm not really attached to these things as long as it serves the purpose I don't care. I just use my car to get around and its just a functional thing in my life. \n\nAt first he was saying he liked my car, being an automatic. He had only driven manual his entire life. Then slowly he began shitting on my car, which I don't care about. When we went on road trips in his car, he wouldn't let me also enjoy the road trip in any manner. He wouldn't let me play music I wanted or drive the car. These were nice locations with really beautiful scenery and I wanted to drive there too. He would let me but then keep criticising  how I drove it..\nI managed to assert myself and ignore these so he would respect my boundaries. \n\nThese car issues were always very aggressive. If he was screaming, and I got out of the car and refused to come till he apologised he would go off and leave me alone on the highway. He never apologised ever. Few times he came back and dragged me back into the car.\n\nOr he d threaten to leave me forever which in turn would make me upset and ask him not to. \n\nDuring our final break up, I refused to leave the car till we spoke his screaming in the car that was so inappropriate. He was screaming at something related to my driving near a toll gate. There was absolutely nothing wrong that happened and he would just hold the car door or behave like I I was driving rashly and he was scared.\n\nHe kept threatening me that if I insisted he stay and we talk about things, he would leave me and I would never see him forever. Which is what happened. \n\nIt's been like a few months now. \n\nI bought a bigger car for myself (it was an existing plan so I could do safe road trips and work cations) and a part of me knows if I was still with him he d bully me that \nA. My new car was shit. \nB. To buy another car. \n\nAnd now when I meet other guys who are passionate about cars even a little bit, I am instantly scared and I want to block them out. \n\nMy therapist suggested I tell them that I have specific trauma related to this so tell them what triggers me and see how they react to it... But I'm scared to tell them coz my abuser was the type who would use my personal information against me. Which is why he would threaten to leave me.\n\nI don't know why I even cared about what he thought coz he was not even worth it - he was very immature and stupid for a man nearing 40, i learned later that his company was caught in crypto fraud and he had no guilt about their crime, his parents didn work either and lived off the charity of his relatives . He earned well or claimed to and would often insult me for \"earning lesser\". \n\nI know what my worth is so it didn't affect me (especially the career and financial part , I work hard and I'm happy with what I have ). He had this problem of being generous to feel important and validated, he d be spending on laptops and expensive gifts for random people he barely knew. Overtime I realized they were new, if they were known for a while, he d be devaluing and thinking poorly of them. \n\nI've been driving for over 12yrs. If anything my exes or guys I've met on dates or even friends would be more than happy if I offered to drive. Nobody has ever said anything about my driving,  except maybe my mother who in general keeps chiding and saying something or the other. I had to tell me mother too to not make comments on my driving coz it was triggering memories of my trauma and even she stopped now. \n\nI don't know how to over come this. I feel like I should gather a bunch of my guy buddies and ask them to do a road trip with me and let me drive through out so I don't feel this traumatized anymore.\n\nWill it help?",

I spent most of the last year in jail for drugs and tampering. Even before that my marriage was failing and I was losing myself for the third time of my life I was losing someone I that I was going to be together with for life for lack of a better term mentally I really checked out a year prior of going to jail I got arrested in January of 2002 I got out in March and was arrested again in May driving a car that was sold to me by someone I grew up with and that person was supposed to be family hard lessons learned the hard way. During my second arrest my wife essentially abandoned me no contact The only support system I had was my mother and surprisingly my first wife whom I had married twice this also happens to be the woman who had completely destroyed me I loved her completely I never in a million years thought that she would be my biggest support system she took care of me when no one else would even know after I was released from jail in November she opened her home to me allowing me to be with my children something I was previously not allowed to do which is my biggest motivation currently to regain a hold on myself and rebuild my life although her help comes at a price I'm injured earlier there is a conspiracy surrounding my life I know this sounds far-fetched but I assure you as true I have no privacy I am followed and watched and my actions tested with the situations for instance over the past week 6 cars have been left running conveniently with no one in them, allegedly I have had a habit in the past of driving cars that didn't belong to me. I am so deadset and turning my life around I didn't even think twice about walking away from those situations I realize there's no easy money to be had. Jobs have been made available for me to earn money the honest way which I intend to continue to do I don't miss the life of struggling and worrying about being arrested. And there are also the situations where substances have been made available The situations I handle all differently because I don't know the circumstances of the conspiracies that surround me I intentionally lead people to believe that I relapse so I game perspective on who's involved and how closely I'm being watched I can tell you with 100% certainty I did not get high. I have only used once sense iv be out it made me realize that's not something I cant go back to...I fear for my freedom and my safety I also believe that at some point I will be bated into a situation where I react negatively.

We knew each other for a while before getting together and during this time we mutually introduced friends to each other, and over the years these friends have blended together into one close knit group.\n\nWhile we were together, things were not good and despite being mutual friends I confided in a few who were closest to me about the emotional abuse I was enduring. They comforted me by telling me they felt his actions were toxic and not acceptable. They also tried to convince both of us to break up over the years by pointing out how toxic it was for both of us. I did try to break up with him numerous times under the encouragement of my friends, but each time, for some stupid reason, I would fall for the hoovering and end up back together while nothing ever changed. All throughout this time, they've tried to maintain equal friendships with both of us. To be fair, he is a very charming and fun guy to be around and has never acted in anyway cruel to these friends so from their perspective, I guess there's no reason to resent him. \n\nFast forward to end of last year, I finally made a clean break. My friends have all been really glad for me (and him) and have supported me through spending time with me privately, checking on me on messages, and inviting me to travelling, etc. and I appreciate all of this. However they have also felt the obligation to give him 50% of their friendship as I guess in their mind, they are not a part of the private drama between us and see us both as equal friends. \n\nDespite having plenty of time with my friends, I still feel a deep pane of rejection/resentment/jealousy when I find out that they are out with him on the weekends. I'm aware that a part of it is a deep seated abandonment issue that is innate within myself which probably played a role in my inability to break up from this relationship for so long in the first place... Recently I voiced these concerns to a couple of those closest to me and got similar responses which can be summarized as:\n\n1) **I am being unfair and entitled if I think they shouldn't spend time with him at all. Many of them have their own relationships with him independent of me and by voicing my concerns I am actually putting them in a very awkward situation of feeling uneasy about splitting their time between us. Just because they spend time with him, does not mean a rejection towards me.** This point I 100% agree with and I feel terrible for feeling so entitled. I also feel ashamed that I am acting a bit off-putting by even voicing my distress to my friends and coming across as incredibly needy.\n\n2) **During my relationship with him I isolated myself from them, often not responding to texts. He never did this and always maintained contact with them. So it is therefore a bit strange that now I'm suddenly so demanding of their time.** This point just saddens me to be honest. I know it's true that I neglected a lot of relationships in my life during the last few years, but I was so preoccupied with my relationship issues and suffering deeply from depression. It also makes me so angry that he could abuse me on an almost daily basis to the point where I had no capacity to maintain friendships all the while he could switch things off and maintain normal interactions with the same people. \n\n3) **There's two sides to every story.** This one hurts me the most. To know that they don't really fully believe my version of the story because they feel this obligation to be impartial to both of us. I am in counselling, have been prescribed antidepressants and am just generally struggling to function as a normal human being again. All the while, I've heard he's been moving on with multiple partners and has even introduced some of these new girls to our friends in social settings - this has actually cut me up a lot to find out about. \n\nI know the solution is I should expand my social network to include people who are not related to him. To be honest I've been trying hard to re-establish lost contacts and spend one on one time to catch up with old friends. But it doesn't change the hurt I feel towards my core group of friends who I view as family and have been there for me over the last few years when I struggled so much. They're the only people I ever opened up to about my relationship issues. Even my real family don't know anything about it.  \n\nI guess I just want to know if I am in the wrong for having these feelings. I worry that the way I'm being is reinforcing the idea that there really is two sides to every story and I am actually a narcissist as well in feeling so entitled. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this and can pass on some wisdom on how to cope with this type of situation?",

I had reached out to the new supply and she confirmed they had been in a relationship for 4 months and she had no idea that he was in a long-term relationship. After I ignored my nex's numerous calls, my nex tried to spin the breakup to the new supply as if he was the one who initiated it and discarded me. Despite my warnings, the new supply decided to forgive him after he begged her for a second chance.\n\nIt's been 7 months since the breakup, and I've been no contact ever since. I was with my nex for 7 years.\n\nIn a moment of weakness today, I made the mistake of looking at the new supply's social media. She posted pictures of them together with captions that he was her 'dream man', and how lucky, proud, grateful, and happy she is to have him in her life. She was absolutely gushing about how much she loves and adores him. \n\nThe rational side of my brain knows it's just the love bombing phase, but it's been 11 months since they first got together, surely that phase would've been over by now? \n\nIt makes me question whether it's all a facade. Why would she describe a man who also cheated and lied to her as a 'dream man'? Are her standards just low? Is she compensating for something? Or has my nex really changed? \n\nI know I don't want him back and I don't miss him, but I don't know why I still feel sick to my stomach seeing how happy they supposedly are together.

        "text": "Bear with me, this’ll be long and highly unorganized. I’m pissed off and stressed. So I grew up with a narc dad and I’m sure you all can imagine what comes with that, and he’s not done wreaking havoc on my family even though I’ve cut him off. This post, rather, concerns narcissism itself, or the associated personality disorder, a discourse which I continually have trouble navigating during my recovery. I’ve been dogpiled a lot for calling out abuse. Now, recently, I’ve come into contact with a certain narrative that I would very much like to call into question, that being NPD should be normalized, defended from accusations of inherent malicious intent. What it seems to stem from is a network of language that narcissists have created for themselves, that which divorces the disorder from its behavior, and, perhaps more importantly, its very own psychological characteristics. The capacity for a narcissist to change, has been, I believe, entirely overstated in these circles, and I feel like most of the enablers in support have a fundamental misunderstanding of the disorder in which they falsely assign their own capacity for empathy to those who cannot feel what they do. The result is a mass self-victimizing campaign for narcissists which has worked to create an echo chamber network of enablers ready and willing to validate the worldview and ego of narcissists, sort of a hijacking of other mental health campaigns, and so we have abuse victims more commonly being accused of ableism for “generalizing the disorder” simply for pointing out potential behaviors associated with NPD, or being antagonized for using the term “narcissistic abuse” (a term which I will defend till the end, because I know how unique narc abuse is compared to other forms of abuse, and treating a bacterial infection is different than treating a viral infection, or whatever analogy you’d like to use). \n\nNow, I know that often these are trolls, but it’s also a genuine issue that I would like to have a discussion about. I tend to believe that narcissism is [an extension of the logic of capital](https://cominsitu.wordpress.com/2018/10/09/all-the-lonely-people-narcissism-as-a-subject-form-of-capitalism/) — an inherently hierarchical view of the world with the individual on top, transactional authoritarian relationships, absence of love and empathy, etc. I’ve done enough research and listened to way too many self aware narcissists talk about how they do not view others as people, but animals, creatures that are easily mastered, to know that a core aspect of the disorder is dehumanization. If you don’t know what I mean, watch [this video from the nameless narcissist](https://youtu.be/DKqRzHDLzIE). I was watching [another video of his today](https://youtu.be/kQhg2pbqh3E), in which he admits to his past involvement in fascistic politics (specifically, Nazism), and it got me thinking. Narcissism’s necessity for dehumanization lends itself directly to racism, misogyny, heteronormativity, etc, simply because they might uphold a narcissist’s delusions of grandeur. I would encourage anyone on this sub to explore the interplay of narcissism and capital and hierarchy and patriarchy and racism and homophobia and the nuclear family and anything else you might imagine in the modern world, because I believe it is these phenomena that produce the disorder and feed the cycle of abuse. Classifying it as biological is reductive to me.\n\nWhile on Tiktok, I encountered many comments suggesting narcissists can change just like anyone, and the classic “I have a friend with NPD and they’re the best person I’ve ever met” (probably trolls), but that also got me thinking. I don’t think people understand that to enter into a relationship with a narcissist is to be dehumanized, to be unloved. From what I understand, narcissists (very rarely) can modify (falsify) their outward behavior, but they cannot do anything about their complete lack of compassion, their bottomless ego maintenance. This begs a few questions. Does a narcissist changing their behavior even matter, and are we to accept the appearance of love rather than love itself? Are we to normalize a disorder which operates on hate and insecurity, which leads to a lifetime of internal (and external) misery, and demonstrably leads a person to thrive on others’ suffering, rather than searching for ways to combat the advent of the disorder itself and the forces which serve to bring about its existence? To me, narcissism is a great tragedy because it is irreparable for those it has already taken hold of. It is maybe the only thing which questions my radical optimism, one of the few lost causes. We can only work to combat ideologies and social institutions that continue to produce narcissism in children. Instead of empowering narcissism as a “different way of experiencing the world” I think it would be more appropriate to imagine how we can prevent it by regaining a more collective conscience. Of course, this is an opinion, and some may think that the narcissist’s world is ideal or acceptable, but personally, a world of self-hating egotistical masters and the pets they use to fuel their egos is dystopian. Not quite different from our current one, to be true. Not a life worth living. I’d like to know your thoughts. Again, apologies for the unorganized rant. Just a lot on my mind.",

It's been a hard journey and I am so glad I made it out alive.\n\nHowever, the pain that currently lingers is the loss of my innocence and the sort of \"death\" of my former self. \n\nI look at pictures of myself before I met my Nex and I don't recognize that person. She's bright-eyed, full of energy and spunk. She used to go into social situations without fear and chat up a storm with everyone and anyone. She believed most people were good and well intentioned. \n\nMy Nex took all of that and (almost) destroyed me. For awhile, I lost all confidence in myself. I became fearful in social situations. I had no energy. I was numbing myself with alcohol and binge eating. I felt like I was floating in life, not really there.\n\nNow that I am free from my Narc, I am proud of the progress I've made. I've gained a lot of that confidence back. My vitality towards life has returned. I take care of myself and my body. I no longer numb myself. \n\nBut I am still scarred. My heart is unsure if I can fully trust to love again. Other people are now something I cautiously approach, always checking to see if they are making an angle to exploit me or put me down. I prefer solitude to socializing. The world seems a lot darker than it used to-- like there are more Narcs in the world than those who are good.\n\nThe person I was at 26 died after 5 years with my Nex. I am fundamentally a different person now. Perhaps this is a normal thing as one enters their 30s. I am not sure.\n\nI am glad I have the wisdom now to not get exploited again (hopefully). \n\nBut at the same time, I miss and mourn the old me.",

        "text": "So, I made a post on Facebook about a very cool book called \"Healthy Parenting: How Your Upbringing Influences the Way You Raise Your Children, and What You Can Do to Make It Better for Them\" It's very good. It's part of my healing process, and part of me doing what I can to help the kids feel safe and unlearn what I didn't know their mom was doing (shame/guilt/etc.), and help them process being left. I just want some of these people who follow me to see this and consider that their trauma is real, and that raising kids is hard.\n\n In my post, I mentioned in what I thought was an innocuous way, some stuff about their upbringing that included how WE raised them, and that she left them. I was careful. Well, I thought I was.\n\nSo, there are still some of our (ex) mutuals who are still following me, and a couple of them laid in hard on me about stuff they believed to be true. Damn, what a mess. I feel like I dealt with it well. When it got personal, I moved over to speaking to them directly in DM.\n\nBut here's the thing: 2 years ago, when she left us, she didn't tell us why she left. When pressed on it by a couple of the kids, she lied, citing some crazy excuse that to us is obviously not true. but it gave me some insight as to what she's probably told people. The rabbid comments on this post furthered my decoding. These friends of hers believe her lies hook, line, and sinker, and without having any knowledge of what happened in our relationship for 30 years, what happened in the privacy of our home. Of course, these lies paint me in a terrible light, which I suspected, and as we all know, is common. They are the victim.\n\nI am fascinated by the Flying Monkeys. These people are loyal! They really have no idea. Here is part of one of the rants in the comments...again, promoting a book on healthy parenting:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; I think it’s pretty distasteful that you’d throw (Ex) under such a bus when you in fact are no better. This isn’t trauma flushing, this is just taking a stab at someone who you know isn’t going to stick up for herself because you manipulated her enough to not be able to. YOU filed for divorce, YOU suggested divorce. I suggest you save your bullshit for your therapist. Grow up, (my name). Be an example for your kids instead of instigating your own personal agenda. You talk a whole lot about narcissism, but maaaan, you check if every box in the book. Everything you’ve said is down playing your intentions and gaslighting the people who push back. We get it, you hurt. You don’t have to grab for the attention in such a negative way. I know divorce sucks, but there’s a certain point where you have to look at an outside perspective and consider it’s not all about you all the time. If you’re going to bring awareness to a book, maybe talk about it’s content without saying shitty things about others. If you’re going to make a “sad boy sad songs” posts, maybe focus on yourself and stop blaming someone who’s had to endure years of your emotional and mental bullshit. You’ve held her back and pushed her down long enough. Stop. \n\nI can tell so much about what they've been fed by this comment. Fascinating.",

I'm not sure the specifics. Emotionally it makes me sad and low key jealous that someone might be getting treated how I deserved to get treated but logically I know she'll be doing the same thing to the next dude. \n\nWhile she's out living it up and then playing victim on social media. I've been trying to heal and recover. The lovebombing stage further ignited that passionate romance that I so desperately want. I know that the lovebombing was fake, but I really would like the woman she pretended to be. I want a kind, caring, compassionate and loving woman. I want someone genuine. \n\nIt's been an extremely lonely road and even though I have family and friends it's still be extremely lonely and I feel isolated emotionally. Some days are better than others. Some days I feel numb, some days I'm tore up, sometays I'm fine. When is the appropriate time to \"move on\". I can't dwell on this forever. It was a 5 months relationship and I've been single about 2 and a half months. I met someone but there were some glaring red flags and when I didn't give her every shred of attention she told me she wasn't interested and I was fine with that. After that encounter I started journaling and really digging deep into my patterns in relationships and why my only two adult relationships involved narcissist abusers. My first one was due to not setting boundaries. I was abused for years and I left when I had my fill. The second was because I made excuses for the abuse. I saw that I didn't deserve how I was being treated, but after she pulled the victim card I put blinders up to the abuse. I chalked it up to her circumstances and past vs the fact she is abusive and was using her past as justification for being abusive. \n.\n I don't intend to waste anyone's time on dating apps. I have trouble finding women I'm interested in though.  I feel like I'm low key stuck ruminating on the abuse and wondering what she's doing and if she's hurting anyone else and still grieving the fact that the person I fell for was a facade. I did love her despite the abuse. I'm sure many here can relate. I cant stop loving her, but it's in my mind time I move to bigger and better things. I know my love will fade with time, but I also don't want someone abusive have the power to control my life outside of contact with them. I don't want to be stuck in this mindset and deprived of the life I deserve just because I had an unfortunate encounter with the narc. My thought process is the narc is out there living life like nothing happened and I need to live my life to the fullest despite what happened to me and to me part of living my life was finding someone I could have a relationship with. I had healed and moved on from the first abusive relationship, but it was years before I was comfortable enough to get serious with someone and I don't want to be back at square one. Part of me wants to pick the search back up where I left it when I entered a relationship with my recent Nex.",

I don’t have suicidal thoughts anymore, I am surrounded by people who make me feel loved and happy. I hardly think about him. When I do get him in my head, it’s hard. I’ll have a day or so where I can’t shake the thoughts. The thoughts go as followed: \n\nI have him blocked on everything and don’t check up on him. However I was googling my old job (trying to find my old bosses email) and I saw a google review he had left when I was working there. I did let curiosity get the best of me and clicked on his profile, he has left one other review on some woman owned tailor shop. It’s another over the top review like from my work. I told my therapist about it and she goes “geez who is he fucking there?” I don’t miss him, want him. I just feel bad he can be out there getting new supply after doing horrific things to me. \n\nSometimes I feel crazy too. He was with the woman before me for five years, and she still would talk to him while he was with me. He was only with me for two years. I know he cheated on her multiple times, would lie to her (he would tell me about it) but I don’t know why they stayed together so long. He discarded me pretty quickly in comparison. \nWhen he discarded me (after I called him out on his lying and called him disgusting) he told me to block him but he will “never block me.” I guess to keep the door open, but he’s never hoovered me that I know of. I do have him blocked so I guess it would be hard but I always hear about nex’s stalking. I know he was looking at my blog for a few months post discard, but then I made it private. He doesn’t give me a second thought. Which just pisses me off because of all the time I have to spend healing myself because of him. I do wish he would hoover me sometimes just so I could ignore it. \n\nI know these thoughts aren’t rational, and I still work on them through therapy.

I don't want to stay reliant on others and even reminding myself that I need to do this to be independent and not homeless barely helps. I've been able to do literally everything else in terms of healing and taking care of myself though.\n\nI'll ask my friend tonight for help as well, but was anyone else in a situation like mine and what would you suggest?",

        "text": "It seems like I always attract narcissists. I’ve had a narcissist female friend and she was insanely disgusting towards me, a trauma dumper, and envious of me even though I helped her at her lowest and after I had enough of her shit I blocked her. And never looked back, Months later,  she kept trying to hit me up on my social medias I never even told her about. Saying a bunch of nonsense and bullshit lies. Exactly a year later she tried to hit me up again! So fucking creepy. Anyway, I recently was talking to this guy online that I thought had chemistry with, but  always on the phone he he would name call me, like say “dumb bitch”, “you’re dumb” and the funny thing is he would say I was his soulmate the first few days we talked and my narc female friend would say me and her were soulmates I guess “friend soulmates” which I knew was absolute bullshit because she would cheat on her boyfriend like crazy. Anyway this guy, the first few days me and him start talking he’s like oh we’re soulmates. Blah blah blah, I love you, which those words mean nothing to me Im an action person I don’t care about words lmao never did. Im going along with it because I think it’s hilarious and I actually did like him I guess but Im always skeptical, anyway 3 weeks after us talking he would randomly just be like “send me money” on the phone and it was just so weird, then he would be like “I’m more intelligent than you” and I remember my narcissist female friend would always try to compare herself to me it was so weird. So this guy, after the last convo I had with him on the phone it was just so off, he lives somewhere completely different from me and I’m in the US, he owns his apartment there in his foreign country and we’re both young like the same age and I was like “how much was your apartment” and he said “why does that matter” and other simple stuff I would ask he would just be super rude and say “none of your business” I started to distance myself because I’m thinking ok he clearly doesn’t even like me because I never even had a guy be like that towards me it was just such a turn off and grossed me out, he then I guess noticed I wasn’t texting him much anymore the last few days so he asks me is there anything bothering you and I tell him well “you never ever ask how I’m doing and you just say dumb bitch on the phone all the time and send money” he then says “oh I was joking about you sending money and dumb bitch “ and I’m like huh .. in my head I’m just like dude if you even really like a girl you’re not gonna say shit like that. Weird as fuck. So guess what, a few days after I told him why I was just distant he GHOSTS me for 4 days which I  don’t even give a fuck didn’t even message him during that time. He hits me up out of nowhere like “Hey” and I’m like so dry like “hi” and he’s like “how u doin we haven’t talked in a while” I’m over here like lol this guy is so pathetic because after I opened up to you, you ghost me and for the first time ask me how I’m doing after ghosting me😂 I immediately got so pissed off after reading the “how u doin” text because 1. this idiot knows I’m over it,  2. It’s not even like you really even give a fuck how I’m doing since you ghosted me, 3. I was already weirded  out by him so this just confirmed everything lmao, then the “we haven’t talked in a while” maybe because you didn’t respond? Texting me so casually and nonchalantly. Narcs are losers who swear they’re so slick. I legit respond the 💀 emoji at the “we haven’t talked in a while text” and straight up blocked him for good in early February of this year when we first started talking near Christmas of 2022. Anyway a week goes by this idiot adds me on my snap from another account asking me “why did you block me everywhere” and I’m just like just delete my pics I deleted yours”  because there’s nothing to even talk about you know why I blocked you fuck out of here. He then finds this Reddit account that I never even told him about and says I don’t know if this is you but I miss you blah blah blah and playing victim and it’s just giving me flashbacks of the narcs I knew in the past. Treating people like trash, then start stalking them and being obsessed with them after they cut you off. I know he found my Reddit because I told him one of my favorite movies was Trainspotting which is the name of my other social media he knew me from. Honestly whatever it’s just creepy how they all are the same. Straight energy vampires and soulless individuals",

        "text": "This is my experience with a friend and I feel I have done some thing \"wrong\" but when I look at the facts I haven't. \n\nI'm also trying to understand what on earth happened to the friendship. I feel confused and this false sense of guilt.\n\nBasically I reconnect with a friend from high school and at first I notice they told me their father was dying from cancer sadly. \nI felt sorry for her and how tough that must be, since her father is young.\n\nI suggested we do a art class together and we did a online art class for kids, once a week.\nWe take turns, so she did one Saturday and the fellowing week it be my turn. We did it through zoom.\nAt first she seems supportive in the friendship and to do the art class. \nFor example she helped me with my work CV and my partners. \nI gave her a small gift of chocolate to say thank you. \n\nShe built my confience it seemed. \n\nI supported her and listen to her troubles.From her father sadly passing away to her sister's troubles and work troubles and her anxiety. \nI once gave her this calming tea to help for her anxiety. Or mention mindfullness. \nI was there when she cried about her dad passing away. I watched through zoom the funeral because it was lockdown at that time.\nI sent her flowers.\nIf I didn't hear from her say couple of days I began to worry, and when we have our catch up after our art classes through zoom she would lay out her issues to me.\nI was emotionally infested with her and not realizing at all I was being used. \nShe even told me I should become a therapist at one point.\n\nWe would catch up for caffee and talk and the art class or go out for cocktail drinks.  \n\n\nHowever over time.... so maybe after 6 months it slowly faded. \n\nThey stopped responding to my texts as often at first it was 3 days then it became a week. I would worry I upset her or she wasn't in a good space. However I found out she was busy dating guys from Tinder.\n\nI did notice I began doing everything for our Facebook page. From videos to posts to even creating her own event page every week when it was her turn!!\nI started to feel frustrated. \n\nIt did became a issue if it was art class related request I wanted her to do and once didn't got back to me for over a week and only 10mins before class started. \nIt was a simple request it was just stating if she could stick to teach them the fundamental drawings so the kids won't get confused. \nThe reason why I said this is because we did a in person art class. I was approached by this community centre to do a art class for the kids and I involved my friend as well. \nHowever!! I will point out! I pretty much did all the leg work. From looking at the class rooms which one would be best, to creating the Facebook event page and banner. To reminding her even on the day before the class to print out our art flyers. I even had to remind her to do bank statement to send to community centre! There was a whole big thing about that too. My friend had this THING! we had to do it for free the class in person. However I wanted us to get paid, because of the time putting in the class together and figuring out how to teach it and petrol. The community centre dude offer to pay us $40, my friend told me to ask the dude is the $40 for each? The dude told me $40 is for us to share and we can split. \nMy friend told me I should've negotiated better. I felt ashamed and guilty and it ruminated my mind for weeks! \n\nMy friend refused to take the $40 and we'll ..the community centre never gave us the $40! \n\nAnyway when we did the art class in person. My friend didn't do much, she just stand and take photos didn't bother to help the kids if they were struggling to draw. My partner who was there for support actually help the kids that were struggling.   \n\nThey wanted to there own in person art class and I was thinking oh hell no I be doing everything. They wanted more kids in class I suggested less so we can help the kids, however my friend disagreed. \n\n\nAfter that event that's when she slowly faded in replying to my texts even more so.\nAt the time they were going to therapy and I notice they suddenly stop talking to me about their work problems or family life issues or their greif with their parent that passed away.  My friend told me how it was great they were getting \"vaildated\". I've been to therapy myself for about 8 years and never once I thought to myself \"Oh it's get to get vaildated\". I thought it was always a odd comment.\nThe reason why it bothered me is because I realised that they were only talking to me about their problems and getting vaildation from me, I didn't realised this  at the time. I thought what I was doing was being a good friend.  \n\n\n\nI eventually built the strength to message them this because I was starting to build resentment and bitterness with the whole art class and doing everything alone. \n\nI said this \n\"Hi,\nHow are you? I haven't heard from you for a while, so I hope everything is going well in your neck of your woods.\nI've been thinking about art class and what I want to focus on with teaching, I've noticed there seems to be a high demand for reading classes of history. \nI got this feedback from Rory from community centre and what the parents were telling him, what they were looking for. As well that one girl in the art class we did, how the mother asked if we do anything else. I also thought it was important since there is lost of  knowledge here .As I've discussed this with my art mentor. So I feel strongly and passionate to help the kids with their art, as it can be hard to seek resources and teach yourself.\nI would prefer to focus on teaching the art class for a small group of kids so they can get the attention they need. I don't want to over-commit myself to too many classes and would like to step away from the free reading classes, so I can focus solidly on the fundamental art class.\nIt will take a lot of time of research and finding what will be easy for the kids to digest from looking through adult art fundamental books, as and doing it kinda like a course so they can take in the information about what they need to learn.\nI do value our friendship and what we've done with reading class and I appreciate your help and your kindness you've shared with me, it means a lot.I would like to continue to spend time with you going forward. I know recently the time we've spent together has been around att Class and I don't want to lose you as a friend, or not see you anymore. Can we still orgainse to me up, for example once a month kinda thing.\"\n\nThey reply back with this\n\"Awww babe\n\nThis reads like you spent ages thinking about how to explain your decision - you don't need to!\nOf course we're friends beyond art class you goose.\nYes, if this is what you want to do, then do it\nI'll take over reading class and see how long i want to keep it going, cos it's not a forever thing for me, either.\nAnd flip yes we must meet up once a month for a gossip etc\"\n\nI replied back and felt a bit defences when they said to me \"you spent ages thinking about how to explain your decision\"\nWhich wasn't really the case it was more to do with me being very clear because of my past challenges with friends.\n\nI replied back and said\noh, I was trying to find the words to express and explain myself. ☺️\nI didn't want to hurt your feelings or anything like that, that all.\n\nYou okay to do it alone with the art class?\nI don't know if your upset or bothered me pulling out?\nI just want to make sure you are okay.\n\nYes excatly drinks.\noh must ask why was that dude a dud?\nwas he creepy?\n\nMy friend responded and said\n\n\"Nah I'm not upset. Like I said, this isn't forever for me, too. But I'd like to keep going for a bit, so I will.\nNo, just a raging disappointment. He cancelled a date TWICE last Sunday, both times only letting me know half an hour beforehand. Then promised to make it up to me but ignored me for a week. Basically slow fading me.\nSo he is no more.\n\nWith the messaging \n\nMy friend told me once how they forget to reply to people. It's not personal.\n\nI said \"yeah I notice that, you seem to reply in the evenings.\" After I said that, she suddenly stopped replying to me in the evenings\n\nAt first my friend started from replying to me often to a couple days in-between. Then the days went to a week or 2 weeks, I notice if you send more than one message then they would reply so say 3 messages. But now they don't anymore. \n\n I recalled when it was their birthday last year and I offer we go out for drinks and I did a protrait of them. I do art on the side so I thought it was a nice gift. They seem to really like it. \n\nWhen it was my birthday, they forgot didn't got me anything or said anything. \nWhen we meet a month after my birthday they said they forgot it was birthday and thought buying me a smoothie be okay??? \nBasically at that time I mention about our art class and told her how it got too much with the socail media and it was taking over my life and the art that was important to me. I said I felt sad and alone.\nInstead of empathize she said to me cut and dry\n\"Well I told you work comes first for me\"\nI was a bit stunned what she said. I don't even recalled or remember her telling me this.\nI told Erin and she knows me I can recall a converstation word by word. And if she did say that my sister knows I would've been upset and told her. My partner agreed with what my sister said as well.\n\nSo I felt a bit confused and started questioning my self. Did she said? pretty sure she didn't. \n\nAnyway,\nI told her how I felt like I was doing everything and she to me up front up \"Yeah it's true you did everything\" I said to her \"So you knew\" and she said \"Yes it's not secert\".\n\nI was shocked and angry at her. I didn't show the emotions or spoke out. It seem my emotion delayed and it was only when I got home what she said was ruminating in my mind and I was wondering why I was bothered by it.\n\nI question and wondered but why would you continue to let your friend to do everything? \n\n\nMy friend said some things that are odd and I thought maybe it be worth to share to see if it points direction of a narc, I'm asking because I feel so confused, rejected, sad and keep blamming myself I was a bad friend.\n\nMy friend told me how before they reach to the age of 10, they thought they were better than everyone else, but realised that they had no friends. So they started to make friends. Which is odd what kid at the age of ten think they are ebetter than everyone else that you don't make friends??\n\nMy sister whom we catch bus from school to home with my friend. My sister pointed out how they found them odd. I asked how? So they made up a example which was say if you brought yourself a t.shirt and say hey look at my new shirt! my friend would be in response \"I don't like that shirt\".\nMy sister explain to me that my friend reminds them Sheldon from the Big Bang tv series. In the sense of how Sheldon isn't aware of socail cues or people emotions.\n\nI asked my other friend about them and they said they always appeared \"smart\". \n\nAnyway my friend told me their longest realtionship is 5 months and how whenever they go out on a date with some dude, they eventually get annoyed with them and complain about them to their friends. Then breaks up with them because they need to get them off them. \nI suggested why not tell them what annoys you then? and my friend said \"Oh no I can't do that\". \n\nThey go on Tinder and date men left, right and centre. They say there is no spark with that person and would happily just drop them like a hot potatoe. They seem I guess confused because they told me how they spoke about this to their sister's husband when they were dating some dude at the time and said there was no spark.\n\nThe hot potatoe examples would be like.\nExample be they dated this guy who is like 6 years younger than them and were going out say a month I said how's your boyfriend? and they said they wouldn't call them there boyfriend.  When I meet them last time they were already looking for guys on Tinder and said that the guy was too touchy and didn't like them stroking their hand. And how they would think they were in trouble by the way there friend told them jokes. \n\nI didn't hear them during Christmas hoildays so I asked to hang out. \nThere they told me how there friend was hooking them up with there friend, but my friend didn't seem that thrill about it. I asked later on how it went they said this \"Yeah! I never met the guy so no worries. I'm just back on tinder having chats there\"\n\nmy response was \n\"oh fair enough won't be odd. Was the dude odd? \n\nOh yep ☺️ have you thought it's just a suggestion like a professional dating set up. So the people help you find someone but with your personatily ? My cousin  did that and now he is getting married. I thought it might help?\n\n\nmy friend response \"No the dude wasn't odd, he looked totally normal. You don't know how these things can be set up if 2 third parties are managing it, so im not fussed. I'm not keen on a professional dating site to be honest. I can get dates, I'm just picky and I know it\"\n\nI repsonse with this but got no response\"2 third parties are managing it? you mean the professional dating? Do you know what you are looking for excatly?maybe we should go by star signs match. So you are Gemini so.... your match would be\"\n\nuntil later on saying it's not there thing. \n\nRegards for a friend being there. \nYeah no. \nEarlier on I told them how I had a hard time with a pervious friend who bullied me badly and wanted to reconnect and I was debating should I? I spoke to them online but they wanted to meet face to face. And how I saw them walking by one time in my car because they came overseas and I live nearby their parents house. \nSo I told my friend how I had these flash backs.\n\nThey didn't reply or responded to that message but the other message they did.\n\nI told them how I was doing EMDR therapy and I broke down crying because a song triggered it and brought back feelings of my parent leaving the family. \nThey said this \"Ohh you ok? Did a bit of a cry help?\"\n\nI replied back and I said I'm okay and explain a bit what was going on..They saw my message and never replied back at all. \nI found a funny picture and sent it to them never replied back. \n\n\nWhat's your thoughts of this friend? \nare they ghosting me? \nwhy would someone use someone for vadilation and just drop them like the a hot potatoe? why help me and be kind to me at the begining and slowly go cold? \nI'm so confused. \n\nAny insights would be appericate and thank you for reading this long message and taking your time to read it as well.",

        "text": "So, 2021 doesn't exist for me (M34). But I got closure even though she wouldn't give it me. (Throwaway as want to leave this sub).\n\n**The backstory**\n\nI met her in autumn 2020. Got lovebombed the shit out of. Wanted me to move in with her. Have kids. Adopt her daughter. I was her (F35) 'soulmate'. I went with it. Thought she was the real deal, but looking back I was incredibly naive and think she may be a full blown narcissist. (Never met one before, so this was all new).\n\nThe rot starts in NYE 2020. Round at hers, due to covid, we couldn't go anywhere. Let's stay in, have a few quiet drinks and enjoy eachother. 11:45PM she blurts out of nowhere 'I have options'... I was a bit floored but just laugh it off.\n\nI meet her parents, her dad was great but her mum wasn't a very nice person. She (her mum) also said behind my back that I wasn't good enough, despite me being a successful business owner.I noted that none of their family spoke to her mother, either which I found odd, but it wasn't any of my business so that was that.\n\nThis is when my ex started rampantly triangulating me against anyone and everyone. Her sister I had never met 'my sister doesn't want to meet you', her best friend 'my best friend wants to hit you' (again, never met her), her baby dad (he doesn't want to meet you) despite things getting serious and me being as lovely as I could to her daughter (I got on really well with her).As the months wore on, I was dumped over text message roughly every three weeks, for no reason.\n\nMe being me, and someone that tries with every situation to do my best, I stupidly take her back every time. I was dumped 10 or 11 times over 2021. She also used to tell me how every guy hit on her, including one time I picked her up from a works function and she told me 'seven men came onto me whilst I was walking to your car'. Wtf.\n\nShe dumps me summer 2021. I just didn't respond. I needed a few days to recollect. I call her after several days to see how she is and to draw a line under it. She then says 'I've got something to tell you'. Oh God here we go. I brace for whatever it is. 'My best friend has called the police on you for ''controlling and coercive'' behaviour.' WTF. Bearing in mind I never shouted, swore or get aggressive. The two small arguments we did have at hers, I left quietly, got in my car and drove home.\n\nShe says the cops want to interview her at her house. Fair enough. She says she will vigorously defend me. Whatever, I let her handle it. I doubt the cops were even involved in whatever as I had no-one contact me. I think it stems from the fact I tried to place a boundary and say that I was uncomfortable with her baby dad going around to hers, bearing in mind they've had alot of casual sex despite being in different relationships and her subsequently having numerous abortions.\n\nAll this blows over. It seems to be okay for a while, but again, I stated that if she did dump me by text again, I'm gone for good. She didn't for some time, until September. Was merrily at work, and she sends a huge essay about why she was breaking up with me. She was being weird and avoidant for a few weeks prior so I knew something was up, again, just totally shut down and ignore her. (It's worth noting when she was being weird and not responding for long lengths of time, she spent a whole day with a male friend that was suicidal. I asked her if he was okay, she said yes, he's fine, he's been in my house crying etc. I felt sorry for him but thought nothing of it, I vaguely know this guy, he's an absolute loser - this is important a bit later on.)\n\nShe breadcrumbs the ever living shit out of me for two months, turns up at work a few times etc, ignore entirely. I didn't block as didn't want to have her number in my phone, as there was points I would be sat on my own and want to send an essay on how much she hurt me, but I kept it to myself. I get on with life, heartbroken and confused, but here we are. I have to respect her choice.\n\nIt finally comes to my birthday, late November. She sends me a message saying she's thinking of me and that she really loves me, but she's been through the worst episode of her life, she got pregnant with a rebound from a neighboring city and has lost the baby and 'this is not a headfuck of any kind'. Wow thanks. On my birthday. I ignore, again. As much as it did screw me up.\n\n**The stupid reconciliation**\n\nA few days pass, she's blowing up my phone, turning up at work (thankfully wasn't there) saying she's desperate to see me. I eventually break and respond 'find God'. She weathers me down, we meet at a bar. She explains she's sorry, and that she really loves me and she wants me back. Grass ain't that green huh? I stupidly take her back.\n\nThree weeks goes by. She dumps me again, blindsided, a few days before Christmas. Saying she has 'been told' I am with my ex girlfriend from 2017. WTF. None of this is true. I go thermonuclear and just wrote essay after essay with a whole load of bridgeburning telling her about herself. I metaphorically just wanted to push her off a cliff so she would never come back. No closure from her.\n\n2022, a new year. Feb 23rd I receive a message from her saying 'I would just like to apologise for the part I had to play in the downfall of our relationship and I will always love you.'\n\nI reply, 'don't worry about it' and that's it, because I genuinely feel we were going to go into nuclear war with the invasion that just happened with Ukraine around that date. She responds with aload of superfluous messages about how she's getting a new car with a private plate... right okay... I ignore.\n\nStupid breadcrumbs start up again. Things like, a photo of me holding her dog, with a laughing emoji. Saying she's going to my music venue etc. I ignore. She last messaged me June 2022 saying my hair looks incredible (no idea where she's seen it, presume whatsapp profile picture). I delete and ignore.\n\n**The healing part**\n\nI start to properly heal. Make sense of narcissism. Lurk in this sub. Count the days since last speaking to her and the stupid breakup 2021 Christmas time, the betrayal, the lies, the confusion. Anger, relief, wtf was I thinking, sadness, all spiking off into those areas through time.\n\nI absolutely throw myself into work, all around the world. I work extremely hard doing some very technical stuff. The hurt fades, even though she's like vapour in my head every day. I stop counting.\n\n**The closure and the hilarity**\n\nFriday night just gone, I punch her name into the facebook social bar as I do every now and again, to ensure everything is absolutely water tight with blocking her and anyone she is affiliated with. She is an incredibly heavy social media user, and used to post selfies of herself atleast twice a day, she's also an estate agent that canvasses for multiple companies so I ensure I don't want her to spy on me.\n\nA public post comes up. It's her and a dude. And I'm sorry this sounds shallow, but she's massively downgraded big time. I look at this guy. It's a public post declaring his undying love for her on valentines day. She looks miserable and has gained alot of weight. The guy is really bad looking, he's got this baldness he won't sort, and it just looks like he has a huge forehead because of it, with tufts of hair growing everywhere. I find this odd, as she cut off my hair with kitchen scissors one night, because she says it was too long, she also said she would never go out with someone that's losing their hair... whatever...\n\nand then I realise, it's him. The suicidal guy that was crying in her house all day because he can't get a girlfriend... and he also works at Home Bargains (a discount store)... despite her and her family saying I wasn't good enough... obviously block him too.\n\nAnd I just laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh... the spell is broken... I send this information to my friends and we all just spend the evening crying with laughter and 'wtf is she doing?'\n\nso yeah, alls well that ends well.... :)",

As soon as I started to \nsecond guess myself, he’d begin to act out again like a spoiled child. I never gave in to his demands and he was not used to not getting his way. I noticed how much it hurt his ego above all else. Not too long ago was when I realized I  was groomed and went off in him. Years past and I don’t recognize him at all. I feel like Ive grown past this experience yet he continues to obsess about it. He has gotten more bitter since I openly told him off. I feel a mixture of regret and sadness since I feel like I should have never given him any attention.",

        "text": "For our weekly brunch, we took my 7 month old to our favorite spot that just reopened under new mgmt. A very popular spot, they quoted us a 5-25 minute wait without reservations. We take our time parking and getting baby settled and happily wait a total of 45 minutes before checking in with the hosts. Not only could they not tell us when we would be seated, but I glean that we are somehow waiting for a reservation to fall through because they don't even have walk-in tables. On top of that we somehow slid from 2nd on the list to 3rd. I start realizing this host doesn't know what she's doing and is floundering. Normally, I might feel bad for her, but now I have a baby and I'm pissed. I'm so pissed that I talk to her plainly. I'm not smiling. I'm generally a people pleaser. (Aren't we all?) I don't think this girl needs to suffer, but I'm not going to thank her for nothing. We start packing up to leave.  \n   \nSecond host approaches me, asking why I'm leaving. Starts explaining how reservations work to me. He was definitely gaslighting me and I wasn't having it. I explain right back how he's wrong. I point to the baby, my goodness. Then he cuts me off to hunch down in my face, \"You have to listen to me.\" Boy, it was a threat if I ever felt one. I take a pause and respond calmly, \"No. I don't have to listen to you.\" You can tell he wasn't expecting that response because he gets flustered and kicks us out for \"speaking to him that way\". We were already leaving. What a dingus.   \n\n\nI've been NC with my parents for several years now and it feels so good to know what I'm about, be certain of the facts of a situation, and not let anyone get me riled up! But not let someone walk all over me either! I just feel so confident in my boundaries, especially when it comes to my baby. Just feels good to have made this much progress with my fight or flight response. Afterwards, I was 100% certain of the facts, I only checked in with myself to see if that response was reflective of the person I want to be. And it was.",

        "text": "I need to know what I was experience with this friendship, I feel heart broken,confused, guilt and self blamming as to why this person has stopped speaking to me. I don't understand why or how to make peace within myself. \nI thought if I find some understand or psychology what went on I will find some inner peace. \n\nI know this message is long, however I will deeply appericate and your time reading this and your point of view upon this.\n\nThank you.\n\n-Content has changed for the sake of privacy.-\n\n\nI reconnected with a old friend from school through socail media and our friendship started at a time when one of their parent's was slowly dying, sadly.\n\n\nThe friendship seem at the time for me was genuine. Looking back I  notice small things that were kinda digs at me like saying my legs are werid after I told them I fell from free rock climbing and broke my fible bone and it's been stiff and hard to rehab it. I dismissed it and thought I was just being over senstive.  \n\nAt the begining of the friendship they were kind and helpful. They take their time to help me with my CV to apply to a job because I haven't worked in a couple of years because I been to therapy due to my anxiety. \nThey also help my partner their work CV because my partner works in the same field as my friend. \n\nWe put chocolate in their letter box to say thank you. \n\nI once gave them a covid test because they were concern they had covid and it was before you could buy covid test from the shops. I asked my partner if they could get some from work. I put it in her their letterbox. \n\nMy friend didn't do the same thing, like gave anything in thanks. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo....this unfolded by starting project together a art online for kids once a week and we take turns once a week to teach.\nHowever after a while...I notice I was doing everything, for example posting socail media content from videos to reminder posts for my art class and my friend's as well. I was creating the event pages for my friend too.\nAfter a while I assume my friend felt guilty and told me they will do their own event page for the art class. I notice as  time went by...week by week, it slowly went from posting it at the begining of the week to 3 days or 2 days before the art class. I would find myself reminding them which is frustrating on my end.\n\nI know they have a full time job and it's full on from what they told me. However! they go on dates with people  during their  work week. So I saw it as they have time to go dating and bake some lemon slice at home they have time to make a event page. It doesn't take much effort.\n\n\nIn-between of this her parent died sadly. I watched the funeral online because of lockdown it was very sad. I sent her flowers. And when we had our art meetings online through zoom she would some times cry so I try to do my best to vaildate her and be there for her.\n\nI would worry about her days outside of our art classes. \n\nThen one day my friend told me \"You can teach the kids the fundamentals of the drawing  and I will teach them the  dirty tricks\"\nI felt afarid to speak up and say no, so I was kinda like ...\"oh yep...\". \nDeep down I was furious.\n\nAnyway, I was contacted by a community centre to do a art  class for the kids in person.They asked me directly not through our art class. I thought to involved my friend  since I felt a bit scared to do it all by myself and I have socail anxiety.\n\nMy friend wanted to do it for free. However I wanted us to get paid, because it's the cost of driving,petrol and time put into a class.\nThe person who contacted me to do the class we will name them Rory, insisted to pay us $40. I told my friend this and they said ask them if it's $40 each? so I did and Rory replied in email \"you can spilt that up between you and your friend\".\nMy friend  was annoyed and told me I should've negotiate better.\nI felt ashamed and it kept going through my mind over and over \"You should've negotiated better\".\nI felt ashamed and guitly that I did something wrong some how.\n\nI pretty much orgainsed the whole event but I kept letting my friend make choices like what date to do it at. Instead of me chosing.\n\nMy friend told me they will email me flyers to print for the class but didn't, I had to remind them.\n\nI asked them  to do the invoice payment because at least they can do one thing. Well...they forgot and I had to remind them.\n\nWe did have a phone call the night before the art class because I was really anxious to do the class. So my friend suggested she will do the intro and the health and safety and the warm class. Which I did appreciate that.\n\nDoing the live class in person went well.\nThough I taught the kids and she stand on the side taking photos and that was it, where as my partner who came along with  helped out a lot more with the kids, couple of the children were struggling to catch up so he helped. Where as my friend stood there like Ice Queen.\n\nAfter the art class Rory asked if we do it again, my friend jump in and said yes I said we will think about it. \n\nAs we were getting ready to leave I had this odd feeling from observing my friend they weren't happy and seem distance. I didn't felt at the time to ask what was up.\n\nThe messages between each other drop dramatically. \n\nI message them and they didn't get back to me until 7 days 10mins before class started through zoom. I was so anxious that they were upset with me that it bothered me for days I even spoke to my therapist about it. \nI said this quote \"I was thinking because we might have new kids in the class, it would be good to keep on the fundamental drawing steps, because then we are consistent in our teaching of the fundamentals, help them to reinforce good habits and in the long run their art will improve. I recalled going back to the basic at school with one of my teachers and I started to improve heaps again.\"\n\nThey said this 10 mins before class started.\n\nsaying \" morning! let's talk after class - I've got a packed weekend so I can't meet in person, sorry\"\n\n And we'll I notice they worked on the fundamentals because I saw their written papers through zoom.. So obviously they saw my message but it didn't show it was \"read\" but didn't bother to message back! This annoyed because I was worried I upsetted them or they haven't read my message.\n  \n\nSo we spoke before our art class started, I asked if everything is okay? she said yes, and seemed happy.\nI asked are you sure? and my friend said yep.\nI replied and said \"So we are okay? because I notice I message you but you didn't got back to me. \" they said\" oh yes, I was telling myself to reply back to you.\"\nI then asked \"So if anything happened between us, you will tell me\"? and my friend  responded \"oh yes, you would know\".\nAfter the class we had a chat through zoom about art  class, I asked how their week was and my friend mention how they been on dates with guys.\nI thought to myself! I knew it! they were having a grand old time and me was worried about them and I was constantly try to remind my friend to do things!!! for the art class. And she is doing none thing!!!\n\nBesides the art class before I pulled away from it.\nThey  seem to become distance, at the time they were going to therapy and I notice they suddenly stop talking to me about their work problems or family life issues or their greif with their parent that passed away. The reason why it bothered me is because I realised that they were only talking to me about their problems and getting vaildation from me, I didn't realised this  at the time. I thought what I was doing was being a good friend. It was only when they start going to therapy that they didn't bothered to talk to me accept for the art class and me doing everything for the art class. I was the one that suggested them  to go to therapy because they told me they would wake up anxious every morning to go to work.  I felt sorry for them as I have intense anxiety myself so I gave them this calming tea and put it in their letterbox.\nI feel a bit sad by this and I do feel a bit used like I was \"therapist\"at the time before my friend went to therapy.\n\n\n\nEventually  I built the strength to message them this because I was starting to build resentment and bitterness with the whole reading class and doing everything alone. \n\nI said this \n\"Hi,\nHow are you? I haven't heard from you for a while, so I hope everything is going well in your neck of your woods.\nI've been thinking about art class and what I want to focus on with teaching, I've noticed there seems to be a high demand for reading classes of history. \nI got this feedback from Rory from community centre and what the parents were telling him, what they were looking for. As well that one girl in the art class we did, how the mother asked if we do anything else. I also thought it was important since there is lost of  knowledge of fundamental drawing here .As I've discussed this with my art teacher.  So I feel strongly and passionate to help the kids with the their drawing, as it can be hard to seek resources and teach yourself.\nI would prefer to focus on teaching the history for a small group of kids so they can get the attention they need. I don't want to over-commit myself to too many classes and would like to step away from the free art classes, so I can focus solidly on the fundamental drawing class.\nIt will take a lot of time of research and finding what will be easy for the kids to digest from looking through fundamental books, as and doing it kinda like a course so they can take in the information about what they need to learn.\nI do value our friendship and what we've done with reading class and I appreciate your help and your kindness you've shared with me, it means a lot.I would like to continue to spend time with you going forward. I know recently the time we've spent together has been around art Class and I don't want to lose you as a friend, or not see you anymore. Can we still orgainse to me up, for example once a month kinda thing.\"\n\nThey reply back with this\n\"Awww babe\n\nThis reads like you spent ages thinking about how to explain your decision - you don't need to!\nOf course we're friends beyond art class you goose.\nYes, if this is what you want to do, then do it\nI'll take over art class and see how long i want to keep it going, cos it's not a forever thing for me, either.\nAnd flip yes we must meet up once a month for a gossip etc\"\n\nI replied back and felt a bit defences when they said to me \"you spent ages thinking about how to explain your decision\"\nWhich wasn't really the case it was more to do with me being very clear because of my past challenges with friends.\n\nI replied back and said\noh, I was trying to find the words to express and explain myself. ☺️\nI didn't want to hurt your feelings or anything like that, that all.\n\nYou okay to do it alone with the art class?\nI don't know if your upset or bothered me pulling out?\nI just want to make sure you are okay.\n\nYes excatly drinks.\noh must ask why was that dude a dud?\nwas he creepy?\n\nMy friend responded and said\n\n\"Nah I'm not upset. Like I said, this isn't forever for me, too. But I'd like to keep going for a bit, so I will.\nNo, just a raging disappointment. He cancelled a date TWICE last Sunday, both times only letting me know half an hour beforehand. Then promised to make it up to me but ignored me for a week. Basically slow fading me.\nSo he is no more.\n\nWith the messaging \n\nMy friend told me once how they forget to reply to people. It's not personal.\n\nI said \"yeah I notice that, you seem to reply in the evenings.\" After I said that, she suddenly stopped replying to me in the evenings\n\nAt first my friend started from replying to me often to a couple days in-between. Then the days went to a week or 2 weeks, I notice if you send more than one message then they would reply so say 3 messages. But now they don't anymore. \n\n I recalled when it was their birthday last year and I offer we go out for drinks and I did a protrait of them. I do art on the side so I thought it was a nice gift. They seem to really like it. \n\nWhen it was my birthday, they forgot didn't got me anything or said anything. \nWhen we meet a month after my birthday they said they forgot it was birthday and thought buying me a smoothie be okay??? \n\n\n\nMy friend said some things that are odd and I thought maybe it be worth to share to see if it points direction of a narc, I'm asking because I feel so confused, rejected, sad and keep blamming myself I was a bad friend.\n\nMy friend told me how before they reach to the age of 10, they thought they were better than everyone else, but realised that they had no friends. So they started to make friends. \n\nMy sister whom we catch bus from school to home with my friend. My sister pointed out how they found them odd. I asked how? So they made up a example which was say if you brought yourself a t.shirt and say hey look at my new shirt! my friend would be in response \"I don't like that shirt\".\nMy sister explain to me that my friend reminds them Sheldon from the Big Bang tv series. In the sense of how Sheldon isn't aware of socail cues or people emotions.\n\nI asked my other friend about them and they said they always appeared \"smart\". \n\nAnyway my friend told me their longest realtionship is 5 months and how whenever they go out on a date with some dude, they eventually get annoyed with them and complain about them to their friends. Then breaks up with them because they need to get them off them. \nI suggested why not tell them what annoys you then? and my friend said \"Oh no I can't do that\". \n\nThey go on Tinder and date men left, right and centre. They say there is no spark with that person and would happily just drop them like a hot potatoe. They seem I guess confused because they told me how they spoke about this to their sister's husband when they were dating some dude at the time and said there was no spark.\n\nThe hot potatoe examples would be like.\nExample be they dated this guy who is like 6 years younger than them and were going out say a month I said how's your boyfriend? and they said they wouldn't call them there boyfriend.  When I meet them last time they were already looking for guys on Tinder and said that the guy was too touchy and didn't like them stroking their hand. And how they would think they were in trouble by the way there friend told them jokes. \n\nI didn't hear them during Christmas hoildays so I asked to hang out. \nThere they told me how there friend was hooking them up with there friend, but my friend didn't seem that thrill about it. I asked later on how it went they said this \"Yeah! I never met the guy so no worries. I'm just back on tinder having chats there\"\n\nmy response was \n\"oh fair enough won't be odd. Was the dude odd? \n\nOh yep ☺️ have you thought it's just a suggestion like a professional dating set up. So the people help you find someone but with your personatily ? My cousin  did that and now he is getting married. I thought it might help?\n\n\nmy friend response \"No the dude wasn't odd, he looked totally normal. You don't know how these things can be set up if 2 third parties are managing it, so im not fussed. I'm not keen on a professional dating site to be honest. I can get dates, I'm just picky and I know it\"\n\nI repsonse with this but got no response\"2 third parties are managing it? you mean the professional dating? Do you know what you are looking for excatly?maybe we should go by star signs match. So you are Gemini so.... your match would be\"\n\nuntil later on saying it's not there thing. \n\nRegards for a friend being there. \nYeah no. \nEarlier on I told them how I had a hard time with a pervious friend who bullied me badly and wanted to reconnect and I was debating should I? I spoke to them online but they wanted to meet face to face. And how I saw them walking by one time in my car because they came overseas and I live nearby their parents house. \nSo I told my friend how I had these flash backs.\n\nThey didn't reply or responded to that message but the other message they did.\n\nI told them how I was doing EMDR therapy and I broke down crying because a song triggered it and brought back feelings of my parent leaving the family. \nThey said this \"Ohh you ok? Did a bit of a cry help?\"\n\nI replied back and I said I'm okay and explain a bit what was going on..They saw my message and never replied back at all. \nI found a funny picture and sent it to them never replied back. \n\nAnd this has been nearly a month now they haven't message me back. I haven't bothered to message them anymore because I don't want to be overbearing and I notice I was always the one first contacting them.\n\nWhat's your thoughts of this friend? \ndo they seem narcisstic or traits of it? \nare they ghosting me? \nwhy would someone use someone for vadilation and just drop them like the a hot potatoe? why help me and be kind to me at the begining and slowly go cold? \nI'm so confused. \n\nAny insights would be appericate and thank you for reading this long message and taking your time to read it as well.",

        "text": "I put an end to my relationship with my narcissistic abusive ex on September 10, 2022. It's soon going to be half a year since I found the strength to leave him but if I am being honest, my heart still feels completely shattered. We were together on and off for nearly 4 years. He cheated on me constantly, degraded me, manipulated me, and so much more. I was always dumb enough to forgive him, I always fed into his lies, and I always believed he could truly change for the better but to no surprise, he never did. In April 2022, we had broken up and a week later he had posted a new girl he was dating. Although it broke me, I decided I would move forward with my life and I did. I was slowly healing. That was until he hoovered in May 2022 and filled my head up with more lies. He claimed the girl he was with was \"just a friend\" and that she let him post her like they were dating so he could show me he was moving on. I spoke to the girl and she debunked everything he said yet I was an idiot and forgave him because I was still in love with him. He broke up with me July 2022 because I began to question him about everything he had done. He said \"I could not move on\" and that \"I was stuck in his past mistakes\" so he didn't want to be with me for it. During that time he was very distant and to no surprise (again) after that break up, he immediately hung out with more girls that were \"just friends.\" A few weeks later he began to hoover again. I felt a little stronger so I did not give in but that only made him hoover for the entire month of July which was mentally and emotionally draining for me. I ended up giving in to his manipulation in August 2022 and forgave him. Every time he hoovered he was never sweet or kind, he always threatened me until I got scared enough to forgive him and then he would bread crumb me to stay which is why it was so difficult for me to say no to him. All of mid-August to early September I was trying to work on my relationship with him but he was completely cold after I confessed how much I loved him. We had not seen each other since May 2022 so he had me begging him to see him but his excuse was always that he was \"busy\" which deep down I knew exactly what it meant. Before I broke up with him, I tried extremely hard to save the relationship. Deep down I knew, this would be the last time I would try so hard for him because I was planning on escaping the abuse soon. Eventually, after all the pain he caused me, I finally chose me and realized he was never going to change no matter how hard I tried. That is when I broke up with him September 11, 2022. He did not take it well at all. He had his accounts private while we were together during July-September but when I broke up with him he instantly made them public and started posting how his past was dead to him. He did this the day of the break up and I firmly believe he did it to hurt me because he had done things like this in the past. 1 week after I walked away, he was already with two girls he had cheated on me with. It hurt very badly but I kept choosing me. On January he unfollowed the girls he cheated on me with and put in his Instagram bio that he had a new girlfriend. He moved on in 4 months since our break up. He had been hiding this new girl until recently that he put her has his profile picture. They have been dating for almost 2 months now and they seem so happy. I just feel so pathetic for being so hurt still. It's almost 6 months and I am still trying so hard to just heal and let go of all the trauma while he moved on like I was nothing again. The cycle was so painful because he always came back. I do not want him to come back anymore but overthinking gets the best of me. Recently I have been pursuing God a lot and strengthening my faith in Christ. I saw that he is too but it all seems so fake to me. I just don't understand why he gets to be happy while I have been in no contact for 6 months and am still struggling. I'm glad I have broken free from him and I truly hope he did change so he won't hurt this new girl but my heart still hurts. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel worthless. I keep questioning did I deserve the abuse? Why does this new girl get treated better? Why did he change for her but not for me who tried so hard for him for 4 years? He had \"moved on\" and hoovered many times but 6 months is the longest he has not. Is this nightmare finally over? and if it is, why do I still feel all this pain? Any advice would truly be appreciated. I feel so lost right now.",

        "text": " \nSo I'm hoping documenting what I went through would help me move past it and give other men going through it some reassurance that they aren't crazy or broken. Plus I could use some advice on getting over all this, because quite frankly I'm ready to be my normal self again. I made a post the other day but deleted it so I can gather my thoughts and not clutter up the sub. Yes I plan on going to therapy when I get the chance.\n\n\nMe (23m) and my presumably Narc Ex (25m) met mid July 2022. We met online and she lives a few hours away from me. Very quickly things progressed. I'm going to touch on that and try to give a timeline of the relationship most of it is a haze though and a blur. It's like a dream that warped into a nightmare. \n \n\nThe first few days were normal talking getting to know each others hobbies and such. About the 3rd or 4th day some flirting began and that flirting quickly escalated into sexting and heavier flirting. Stuff like omg I've never met anyone like you, it's felt like I've known you for years. It was intoxicating and around day 9 hit and I love you was first said. Then about 3 days later we decided to get together it was more her asking. I agreed thinking hey what's the worst that can go wrong? I had been single for years and she mirrored what I wanted in a relationship. I figured if things got dicey I could just leave, but I couldn't pass up on this fairytale relationship with a woman I was into and who seemed to have the same values as me. Well I come to find out this was lovebombing and sex bombing. I feel foolish for rushing in so quickly. A week and a half or two weeks after knowing someone. I had a weird feeling knowing she couldn't really love me after 9 days and an ex from highschool who I'm still in contact with told me that it sounds like lovebombing and I should run. I did a few minutes cursory google search and ignorantly determined oh this isn't lovebombing. \n\n\nSo things go amazingly well I'm on 3rd shift at this time. I had cut off some toxic people before we met. So my main social circle is two out of state friends and my friend who was at this time engaged and had their two kids to take care of. So my Nex was front and center in my social circle. I would go to bed in the morning and wake up in the evening to sometimes dozens of messages cute memes romantic paragraphs. We also get into a bdsm relationship kind of dynamic right after the romantic relationship started. This plays a part because we're both switches and in reality it was used to make me more emotionally dependent on her and for her to use it to make me be the one to take care of her basically. \n\nAt this time and basically since the beginning of when we met she laid on the sympathy seeking. Her life and who hurt her was front and center. It was her her her all about her. She lived with her alcoholic dad and took care of her niece. She would send videos of him yelling and recordings she took and pictures of her crying and looking back it was some real immature type stuff. Posting on her snap story her crying and once Talking about a guy who left her. I came to find out he ghosted her a few weeks before we met. Basically she told me how no one in her family was there for her and her one friend always chose the guy she was currently with over her. I consider myself very empathetic and unfortunately I have a fixing people issue which has gotten me hurt before. I have seeing people in emotionally distress. Seeing someone in emotional distress makes me sad and I try to help those who are feeling down. She told me of the ex's who were abusive and broke her heart. How she had a miscarriage and her ex fiance didn't help her through it. See the sick part is my mom had a stillbirth when I was in highschool and I had a prior ex that was abusive in every way. I say it's sick because it seems like she threw out all the bad shit in her life to see what I could relate to the most then used what I could relate to as an excuse for her behavior. \n\nSo this is where things get bad. She does a push pull thing from  mid September till the end. From mid September all the sweet stuff stopped and she was cold and distant. Everytime I brought up the change it would turn into a fight. I was just worried she was depressed knowing her home life and her history of self harm. From here on out she says we fight all the time. I think this was gaslighting because we didn't fight all the time. I brought concerns up from time to time.and about this time I took on a therapist role because she was always going on about how the world is against her. \n\nOur first actual fight was in October the previous fights were bickering. She had been  posting sexual jokes and stuff that wasn't boundary crossing but close. We weren't Facebook official yet I was waiting until we were able to see each other in person to make that move. There was one guy who would always comment and react to that sexually charged stuff only. None of her other stuff. I asked who he was out of curiosity and she told me she had met him through her friend. The friend who apparently was never there for her. She comes into play later. I just told her since she never met him if she ever hangs out with him be careful because I know how guys can be. I've known some scummy guys. This devolves into a high argument where she messaged him and says \"my boyfriend thinks you're trying to get into my pants\" I never said that. She screenshots his response which was basically oh no I'm not whatever and sends it to me. At this point I'm upset that she's trying to make me sound crazy to others and  took my question and concern for her safety and well being and twisted into something it wasn't. Funny enough she made this a fight when I was on a trip with my uncle. Seems like a narc thing to do. She made an excuse that well my ex's didn't want me to have male friends. It seemed like a reasonable thing at first so I let it all go. Things ramp up with I guess a second phase of lovebombing.we met in person the first of November. \n\n\nOur meeting seems to go really well we got a hotel room and things seemed magical. But I felt used for sex afterwards. She was there a few days and all we did was stay in the room and do sexual shit. We ordered foon and only left to go visit my family. I wanted to actually go out and go on a date proper. When she left she put on a big show crying and having anxiety. Which left me sad because I already didn't want her to go. \n\nThen the friend who had moved away months prior comes back and she starts hanging out with my nex again. More pulling away more fights. The 2 visits in December follow the same pattern of just leaving me used for sex and for her to complain about people who hurt her in life. Idk why se even came tbh...\n\nThe last week was the worst. It was one big fight. She made shit up to fight with me about. She started a fight because she didn't give me head and felt bad about it and got upset when I said it's whatever I don't mind. Like this was a huge fight because she thought I didn't care about her or was into her when I really just didn't expect sexual acts? It doesn't make sense. \n\nThe last day before the break up I accused her of cheating. This was 2 months of pulling away and starting fights and the gaslighting.  Phonecalls where we'd talk for 5 minutes and she'd go to bed. Well her friend messaged me calling me abusive and calling me a narcissist. Saying how everyone know I have issues. When I called my ex she denied saying anything to her friend.  We talked on the phone and I told her I'm not allowing anyone to talk to me like that and she needs to tell her friend not to talk to me like that especially since I don't know the friend  and she gave me an hours long explanation of how her friend ruins her relationships and she promises she won't leave and then guess what y'all? I got dumped the next day. Because \"she's my friend\" I never told her not to be friends with her. I just said if the friend is that bad maybe she should consider cutting her off if she makes you that unhappy. \n\nWe talked the day of the break up and the day after and I told her I want to work things out. She told me she doesn't think things are fixable but she wouldn't really tell me what the thing were. All I wanted was to feel loved and like I had a place in her life. I was an after thought and I didn't understand why this person who supposedly loves me never made time. \n\nWe go a few days not talking I reached out on new years eve after my parents said maybe I should. My dad mostly. My parents didn't know how horrible things were behind the scenes. I didn't tell anyone because I didn't want anyone to think less of her. She tells me we're gonna get back together and be ok but we dont (shocker) and she strings me on some. I tell her not to contact me unless she wants to actually reconcile and get back together. \n\nA week and a half goes by and I get a hey how are you doing text. I tell her good and we talk she tells me how she misses me and doesn't feel right with out me. Long story short she's talking to another guy while talking to me. A guy she just met and used her for nudes and when I told her he's using her she got mad at me and defended this dude and is jealous that he gives attention to women and isn't into her. I tell her to never contact me again and block her on everything. This was mid to late January. Funny enough that guy still doesn't want anything to do with her. My friend and cousin still have her on Facebook even though I told them all to block her because she knows there friends still and probably some of what she posts will get back to me and I think she probably wants me to open communication up again. I don't want to. \n\n\nHere's where I'm at present day. I feel lonely and lost. I cry all the time and miss her. What do I miss? Idk typing all this out made me realize how bad it really was. I'm trying to move on and meet new women but I'm having a hard time even being attracted to anyone. I met one girl who I went on a date with. We talked for about a month then she got upset when she timed my response time to see if I'd double text and when I failed the shit test she made she let me know and then went on to tell me she wants someone to need her and want her (3 weeks after we met this happened) I told her that doesn't sound healthy and I'm trying to not get into something toxic again. She then proceeded to tell me that she isn't like my ex's. Needless to say we don't talk anymore. I started to simmer down on my interest and she hit me with she isn't ready for a relationship and went our separate ways.\n\nRoughly two weeks ago  I stumbled upon lise leblanc and Dr Ramani on YouTube and oh boy did their narcissist videos basically do a play by play of my relationship with my most recent ex. So I've identified she's probably a narcissist. But I still love her it's so hard to keep no contact in place. I know she'll never change. She had ample opportunity. I feel guilt and anxiety talking to other women. I'm scared if I did meet someone I'd be too scared to open up fully. Idk how to stop loving my ex. This is insanely but it makes me sad that if she's a narcissist she will never experience love like other people do. I couldn't imagine a life like that. I just want her to be happy and I literally detailed what she did to me and still want her to be happy it seems sick and twisted I can't wish I'll on her or hate her. If I hated her it would be easy to move on. I know I can never go back because me giving in would just be permission to treat me poorly I know the only way is moving forward.",
