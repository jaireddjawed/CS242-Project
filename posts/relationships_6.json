        "text": "Hi guys, hope you are doing really great.\n\nI have been knowing a girl just online for around 3 years, and one day she decided to come to my country and spend a week together traveling. The thing is, her parents refused to let her come alone to my country, that's why they decided that her uni friend (guy) to come too, even tho I feel like she is annoyed from that.(She would pay for her nights and food etc)\n\nThe thing is I'm kind of person who has never been in a relationship before (22 years old virgin), it's not I didn't have the opportunity but I just wasn't caring! and still I'm not thinking about having one right now, but I don't mind if it is for a limited time I don't know, for experience...\n\nShe told me before that sometimes she feels strange as she sees her other classmates get in a relationship or at least were having an ex while she never had one before... So I was asking myself, did she just want anybody to be with? Why does she wanna come?\n\nAlso I don't know what to do, I mean I don't know if she is coming here just to meet me? Or to just spend some good time? Or want to have some sex experience..\n\nIn fact, we were talking about a lot of stuff in these 3 years, and I guess that made her think I'm interested?\n\nI feel like asking her exactly why she wanna come could be a bit \"rude\"? I'm afraid that she wanna come here for sex and I would not offer that for her, or she would gives me signs that I would not catch. (Since she would come with her friend, I guess there is a less chance for bed?)\n\nIf I 'm going to have sex with her, I don't want her to think that I'm looking for a long-term relationship with her(not because I don't like her, she is cute and I like her personality but I just don't want it for now)\n\nSo tell me what to do, should I just accept her request and travel together?\n\nThank you and have a nice day.\n\n \\--- \n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : Just what do you think is the reason for that girl to come, long-term relationship? or just some kind of a hook-up.",

        "text": "I (F28) have a cousin (F~32) who I was close with as kids. We didn’t hangout as much in our teenage years but a few years ago we became close again.\n\nWe became each other’s biggest supporters, my then girlfriend (F34) and I babysat her kids, when we got engaged there was no discussion needed - we knew we wanted her to bake the dessert (she had a baking company), and she and I were even talking about going into business together.\n\nWe saw her not too long after we announced our engagement in summer 2020 and she seemed genuinely happy for us and congratulated us. Then a few weeks later I started noticing that she was posting some homophobic ideas on her social media, under the guise of religion.\n\nNot too long after that she called me. She told me she “can’t fellowship with” me anymore because she doesn’t agree with my relationship and we went no contact ever since.\n\nA year or so later, she showed up at my parent’s house for a very small family gathering and was saying “hi” and trying to engage in casual conversation like nothing ever happened. I was cordial but very guarded and overall taken aback because I didn’t know she’d be there.\n\nBack in December, she called me and left a voicemail asking how I was doing and repeatedly telling me that Jesus loves me.\n\nMy parents keep saying that I should try to make amends since she’s trying but I feel like she should approach me with the same energy she did when she ended our relationship. She should call me and have an honest conversation about why she now wants to reestablish said relationship, not just act like nothing ever happened and we can pick up where we left off.\n\nAm I asking for too much?\n\nSN: I have no problem with her being religious or letting me know that Jesus loves me. I’m spiritual and have a relationship with God but I just don’t believe that His love for me is any less simply because of who I fell in love with.\n\n\nTLDR: My cousin cut me off because I was marrying someone of the same sex and it didn’t align with her religious journey. My family thinks I should give another chance but I think she needs to acknowledge what happened first. Am I wrong?",

I know he thinks I have more things to improve on, but at this point it just feels nit picky. I’m not perfect, I’m aware of my issues (I get defensive. Used to get bad anxiety and ruminate causing relationship strain) I’ve been going to psychiatrist for 2 years and have come a very long way. We both see it. Anyway he still doesn’t know. If we ever get into a disagreement I can see that he gets unsure and if I bring it up he’ll even be like “we’ll we got in the argument…” we live together. We’re happy. We’re comfortable. He knows what I want. I also really want kids and he knows this too. When is it time? I don’t want to start over at 30 :(\n\nTLDR: been together 5 years, living together 3.

        "text": "Yeah I'm in a situation it looks like. He said no more sex and the reasoning was that he didn't want to hurt me, meaning he thought I was going to fall in love with him. Which I found a bit unfair... deciding for me. He said he really wants to take the time to work on himself and find out why he's so scared of intimacy, but I told him I'm scared too. Why can't we be scared together? We click on so many levels, we share so many similar experiences and philosophies. There's a fundamental understanding that's very hard to come by. I don't even know if I want something serious, but I do want to explore the connection and see where it leads me. At the end of the day, I don't fully understand, but I respect his boundary.\n\nAnyways when he revoked the sex he still mentioned that he jerks it to me sometimes, or that it wasn't that I was bad at sex. Maybe he was just being nice. He has a tendency to do that. We flirted a bit in a roundabout way, talked about other hookups, he mentioned how he saw me prettying myself up in the bathroom mirror of the bar, and I said it wasn't for him it was for me, a bit angry that I had to react in a way that upholds the boundary he set instead of the other way around. Shouldn't it be a 2 way street? He wanted to let me know he still wants to keep cuddles on the table. He even mentioned how he wished his mother put more of an effort to learn english in case he brought a boyfriend home who didn't speak her language, and that confused me too because it felt like he was indirectly talking about me. On top of all of this, we are emotionally supportive of each other. We have crazy stupid fun together, and there is nothing that is off limits. Just sex, and exploring our connection with open and direct intimacy.\n\nI am so confused. How is revoking sex protecting me if you're still flirting with me? Flirting builds sexual tension, it shows your affection towards someone, but what's the point really if we know we're not going anywhere? If you're scared of my emotions growing, how is cuddling different from sex?  \n\nHonestly, if he talks to me about other people he's dating, other people he's hooking up with, that would piss me off to no end. I don't want to hear what you're giving others and not me. I don't want to hear how you're exploring other connections or to what end if you said you're not ready at this point in time. It would just make me feel like I wasn't someone worth doing that with. Even though I said I'm not sure if I want something serious/am scared of intimacy myself, the flat out disrespect of being told you aren't worthy of pursuit would be too much for me, and I need to believe that I'm someone who is. I want someone to treat me like I am. I never had that. It always sits in the back of my mind the depth of our connection, the potential of it, all the things we can learn from each other because we mirror each other in so many ways, and it would destroy me to know he didn't want to find out what we were worth, or dropped me for someone else, and instead opted for this situation where we beat around the bush out of fear.\n\nI don't know if I can be \"friends\" with someone I see romantic potential with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR! Guy who I have an awesome connection with took sex off the table because he's scared he'll hurt me (that I'll fall in love with him) and wants to work on himself, but still teases/flirts/cuddles with me and I'm completely confused :):):):)",

I feel like I am somewhat stuck with him because if I would break up with him completely then it would be bad for me financially and he would be completely broken. \n\nHe has had a pretty tough childhood where his mother was never there and he was constantly neglected. He grew up poor and has had to go through a lot of traumatic events, as well as growing up with bad influence.

I have given him a chance for a better and calmer life with a lot of support but since I have depression I need that support and help just like he does. \n\nI do most chores around our home - cleaning, cooking, laundry, dishes and even though i have told him to be more involved in helping me out he still has not shown his effort. We both have a job, although his salary is higher than mine, and without his financial support i wouldn’t be able to pay rent and all bills. \n\nLately our relationship has been very rocky as I don’t want to be romantic or intimate with him and he normally isn’t an intimate person at all. He does sincerely apologise with flowers when he has done something to upset me though, which I like a lot and appreciate. \n\nWhen we fight we fight loudly and aggressively (but never physically) and I have told him four times now that I do not want to be with him as I don’t have feelings anymore but he loves me and is very attached. He has shown me unconditional care because he is terrified of losing me. \n\nAt this point I feel like i am stuck in life because I can’t really be free and live my own life anymore because no matter of my feelings he still wants to be with me and I genuinely believe he would be back to rock bottom when I would leave him completely and cut all ties. \n\nI want to know if I should do what’s best for me and break up, which would result in hurting him a lot(which i would not forgive myself) or try to fix our relationship and change him as a person so he would be who i want him to be. \n\ntl;dr: my boyfriend is extremely attached to me but i have lost feelings towards him and i want to break up.

We have discussed our future together (marriage, family, kids) and I really like him. However, in June I will be graduating from college and I’m not really sure what is next for me. Due to family circumstances and financial reasons, I will most likely be moving back home (which is a 6 hour drive). I made this decision recently after talking to my parents and I feel like it would be best for me. I don’t know if a long distance relationship would work for me or my partner. I don’t really know how to communicate this because I’m scared how he will react and I don’t want to break his heart. I don’t know the best way to approach this is. On the other hand, my boyfriend has mentioned to me that he is going to continue living with his parents because it will save him money, so I know where he stands. I don’t feel like we are at the stage where we are ready to move in together. This situation is honestly very saddening for me because I don’t want to lose him but I feel like we can’t make long distance work. I really value him as a person and I don’t want to hurt him but I’m not sure if things can work. Does anyone have any advice on how to have an open conversation about this and how to approach it? \n\nTLDR; in a committed relationship, but I’m graduating soon and moving back home after college. I haven’t told my boyfriend yet because I’m not sure how to approach this and how our relationship would work long distance.",

One of the things I said to them was, I felt quite insecure over the fact that 70% of the accounts they followed on Instagram were fit, young white IG models. It made me always wonder if he truly wanted to be with someone like them because I’m not in my early 20s anymore and I’m not white either. \n\nNot long ago, I noticed that they followed new accounts (curiosity got the better of me) and found that they have started to follow girls who have the same ethnicity as I do… I’m confused??

So I am aware of guys who slept with her. \n\nFor some reason last night we were talking about a specific town in our country and it was the town where one of those guys lived in. This guy was a student who studied in our city but travelled back home often because he had a gf but my current gf slept with him knowing he had a gf. \n\nSomehow I stumbled across his Instagram profile (first time and it was amongst the recommended profiles) and I found out this guy is super ripped (my gf always says how I should hit the gym more often) and to my surprise I found a like to a pic of him in London (26th of February 2023) which was also the day we had an argument. \n\nScrolling down I found that in the past she liked plenty of pics of him shirtless (before the relationship). \n\nI am a bit paranoid as lately there has been a decrease in intimacy according to her due to stress from work (it’s true she works in a toxic environment) and also some weird statements have been made. \n\nAlso she never gets anything notification from insta but when she opens the app I can see how she has 1 or 2 dms unread. \n\nHow should I approach the situation? I don’t want to come across as insecure but it’s something which concerns me. \n\nTDLR: gf liked a recent old hookup picture on the day we argued, recent lack of intimacy and other comments make me question relationship. How should I approach this situation?",

        "text": "My husband (33M) &amp; I (32) got married 3 years ago and phenomenal man he is. He's the sweetest, silliest, funniest &amp; most adventurous man in the entire world. I'm absolutely blessed to have met such an incredible human being. When I met, he was a single single father to twin daughters that were 4. Unfortunately, his wife passed away 2 years prior in a car crash. I met him when he was trying to return into the dating world, he wanted to meet new people &amp; slowly move on and find love again. We ended up meeting, falling in love, got married &amp; had a baby boy in the span of 2 years.\n\nHere's why I'm jealous. He still visits his wife constantly and from the stuff I've heard, he loves her so much that he cries. I've been told when he goes to the cemetery, he sits by his wife's grave and talks to her. Tells her how much he loves her, misses her &amp; wishes she was here to see their beautiful daughters. He goes alone sometimes, other times he goes with his girls. This past valentines day, he woke up early morning to visit his wife. Left her a ton of roses. I wasn't there, he wanted to be alone. I get jealous just thinking what romantic stuff he was telling her. He didn't neglect me though, I had an amazing valentines! He took me out &amp; we had a beautiful time. My husband never neglects me, he shows me love everyday. But the love he has for his ex-wife is obvious. I know I should be jealous, that's his ex-wife and the mother of his girls. \n\nI was told he spoke about me &amp; our son to his wife. He supposedly told her I'm a wonderful woman and that our son is so silly and cute. I appreciate that he speaks about me, I never knew his wife but I want her to know I absolutely love &amp; care so much for her husband. She was a lucky woman, I just hope she knows I love him.\n\nHow can I stop being jealous? I feel so ridiculous being jealous of a dead woman. She may be dead, but she's still alive in my husband's heart. He's never going to stop loving her &amp; I need to accept that. But him visiting her, talking to her and saying he loves her makes me feel quite jealous. I know he loves me, but my feelings are just mixed up about all of this.\n\nTL;DR: my husband is still in love with his dead wife. I want to stop being jealous, because it's ridiculous.",

That was on repeat for a while. I was so stunned I was just silent. Then he said he knew it was a scam, he knew what was happening but he was so scared and he just wanted it to go away. He said he actually called the police because he was so scared and didn’t know what to do.\n\nI have his email and this individual sent him a lot of emails so perhaps this was the rush to tell me, I don’t know.\nI had a surgery and have had a series of complications so we haven’t had seggsy time in a bit over a month. Not that this is an excuse (!!!!) but providing context as we literally just had a conversation last night of him essentially telling me he was horny and sad about it but recognizing my surgery.\n\nI’m sad, I’m angry, I slept about 2-3 hours last night and know that I’m not thinking straight. I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m living in some stupid movie. Like who does this actually happen to? He’s not stupid, he knew he was being scammed! I’d be lying if I said that this wasn’t the first time he’d wandered in some fashion. We’ve had problems over our almost 10 years together. After the last set of problems, he saw a therapist which was really helpful to a lot of different facets of his life, and there wasn’t an incident that I’m aware of for a long time. We moved from that state and he didn’t find one here several years ago.\n\nSorry for the rambling. I’m just dumbfounded. Nobody prepares you for these things. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know what to say, I don’t know how to act. \nI essentially just stayed totally silent (shock) and then demanded I know all financial details (did I mention that we are BROKE- he started a new job and is on training pay for now which is shit and I’m out of a full time job after my surgery), because we have almost all joint bank accounts. \nThen I think he called my mother- who he has a good relationship with (…did…) because she’s our financial advisor essentially \n\nTLDR: fiance went online, sent nudes to a girl, girl blackmailed him for 2k, he called me sobbing and confessed this AM.

He then started struggling to keep jobs because he struggled to stay awake.  We agreed that while we were waiting for treatment I would work and he would stay home and watch our (3f) year old and take care of the house. It took about 1 year and half to get treatment but he's been having issues longer than that. I've tried to be patient and would have conversations with him to step up his cleaning game. He would apologize say he would do better then about a week later would back how it was. I let the house slide a little to try to meet in the middle cause he was new to it and he was dealing with what turned out to be a medical issues. He was treated a month ago now and says he feels better. The house looks somewhat nicer I'll admit but it still is pretty messy. Most of the time he says he \"doesn't see the mess\" or it \"just not up to my standards\" I should add I'm still coming home and picking up, doing my half of the dishes, my half of laundry, trash and much more. We have fought about it constantly to the point I'm at my wits end. He suggested I write him a list to do so I did and he would do like 60 percent of it then 40 I would have to fight with him to do or he would say it is done but clearly not. I have communicated clearly what I need him and even had time limits put in place but he would still not do it. Is there anything I can do at this point?\n\nTL;DR! Is there anything I can do to get husband to do his part of the cleaning since he stays home?",

        "text": " \n\nTLDR, My EX cheated on me and I made an animated video confronting her. All names have been changed, and we are in good standing, this is all for comic relief. Here's the video, ENJOY! [https://youtu.be/HQ-LNnmpPVk](https://youtu.be/HQ-LNnmpPVk)\n\nFor context. I wasn't the best BF. I had my own issues. I was impatient, I was a bit of a slob (so was she) I had little ambition, and I probably spent too much time hanging with the boys. Afterall, I am a local musician (gross) but at least I like to get out and have fun, ya know? Anyways, I understand why she wanted to dump my ass, but she didn't have to cheat and do me in like that!! Of course, she claims there was no cheating, even though she was forming a new, very intimate, long distance relationship with a guy online only two days after dumping me, while we still lived together! Sounds fishy... plus, he was just like me! hahaha... I mean really, She managed to find the one other guy obsessed with the artist Max Ernst on instagram! hahaha. My point is, I wasn't perfect, but at least I didn't cheat after 7 years together. When she dumped me after a bad fight while we still lived together, I made an honest effort to clean up my act (for what it's worth) I quit drinking, I started anger management therapy, I cleaned the whole house, I made gourmet meals (you'll see in the video) I did everything I thought I could to save the relationship, only for her to \"cheat\" on me! That's pretty lame... Look, her biggest issue was her insecurities. Whether it was her education, (she was very smart) her physical appearance (she was VERY beautiful) things like that. It didn't matter how many times I told her EVERY DAY for 7 years how beautiful and smart I thought she was, because she truly is smart and beautiful, she would project her insecurities onto me and it was a total drag... I mean really... You tell me how you'd feel watching the morning news only for you girlfriend to say, \"Wow... I bet you'd rather fuck the news lady than me!\"... OMG! Grow up dude! We all have our issues, my dick is small, I never greaduated college, but at least I never put that shit on her! hahaha! So, she dumps me, moves on sexually and makes other plans with another guy in our house when we still lived together, and leaves the state two months later. I was soooo fucken heart broken. I missed and loved her so much! I tried my best, but she let me go when I needed her the most... (I know total sob story) Fast Forward a few months, and I find some of her belongings here, like pictures and books n' what not. I sent them back to her parents house where she lives, I receive a thank you from her, whatever. Then I remembered she still had some of my records that got mixed up in the move. (records that meant a lot to me) I asked her to send them back, and I venmoed her $40 for the shipping costs, she ghosted me, and after I made stink about it for a few weeks, she blocked me on EVERYTHING and basically told me to fuck off! That's so not fair! Look, I know I should've dropped it, but damn, I sent her shipping money, I asked nicely, and I sent back her stuff, the least she could've done was send the stupid records back... ugh... So here we are now... still no records, and I've basically dropped the whole situation. I left her some crazy drunken voicemails since then, but I generally left her alone about it. Of course, there's always two sides to every story, and her version of events may sound a whole lot different. Yes, I kinda felt bad for being so mean, but damn dude, at least I didn't lie to her face about cheating. Trust me, she was very mean. She would physically abuse me, call me names, prevent me from working, etc. etc. I was a dick too, don't get me wrong, but I never physically abused her like she abused me. Most the time she was funny, witty, smart, and I loved being around her! despite my better judgement, I truly loved that girl. Anyhow, I was listening to some of the drunken voice recordings I made last year, and I thought it would be funny if I animated one into a simple story board and share it with you guys. it's very mean, but not as mean as her cheating on me. I hope you enjoy!\n\nP.S. She is very beautiful and I'm not trying to make light of eating disorders. She watched the vid, and I guess she told my friend that she got a kick out of it. She's doing fine, and I wish her the best. I don't hate her, I have no animosity towards her, but it's lame she still wont give back the records! Whatever, I will take that loss! Take care y'all!! ENJOY! ***HERE'S THE LINK BELOW!***\n\n[https://youtu.be/HQ-LNnmpPVk](https://youtu.be/HQ-LNnmpPVk)",

        "text": "My question goes more in depth than the title. I need sdvice on how to handle dating her while she also babysits my girl. I have known this woman for the longest. She was always there for me and helped me a ton. Ever since my ex and I had the baby, she offered me her help because I used to struggle financially.\n\nI was left to raise my daughter by myself and it was hard working and taking care of her all at the same time. So my friend gave me a hand. I had a big opportunity come up and I was able to get on my feet and I have a house and everything I could ask for now.  \n\nWhile my friend was helping, she told me she could be my daughter's babysitter and watch the house for me since I work a lot. So whenever my mother can't watch my daughter my friend helps me out. She does a lot for me and she was there for me last year when I almost lost my life in a bad motorcycle wreck. I was out for a long time and she helped me through that because she felt bad that I was not physical able to get around by myself and I was in a lot of pain.\n\nNow it became kind of routine for her to be at my place. She cooks for us, helps me take care of chores arpund the house, and she has taught my daughter well and has been a good role model for my daughter. I know I should have thought about all this before, but things kind of have been falling into place. We still haven't talked about what we 'are' yet. \n\nIt feels natural for me because it's kind of like we are a couple already. We have breakfast/dinner together, she helps with my kid, we have sex everyday/night, and she sleeps over very often. Right now all my daughter understands her as her being just a good friend. I am in love with this woman and I know she loves me too. I really have strong feelings for her and I think she and I will moat likely work things out and settle down together.\nBut,\n\nI don't know how to do the whole relationship thing without my daughter getting too attached yet? Or should I let her look up to her??\n\nTL:DR i am in love with my close family friend who watches my daughter. Things feel like she and I are already together becauss we live like if we were settled down together and we both love each other.  I don't know how to move forward while having a kid of my own.",

        "text": "I (27F) moved across the country with my boyfriend (43M). We have been together for 2 years. He wanted to move back to his hometown, and I decided it was worth a try. We didn't live together prior but did a month trial run before we moved. All was going well enough. A part of me just wanted to move out of my home state because I have a hard family life and wanted to try something new. He offered me some stability in our relationship prior to this. We aligned so well at first, but I'm growing, and I love it in my new state. He has a good paying job, but when we first got here, I was struggling to find a job that was a good fit. He is extremely judgemental. He is of everyone. When I try to vent my emotions and struggles moving to a new state or the feelings I have being away from everything I know. I feel dismissed. We don't have sex anymore. He had problems keeping it up, and it seems like he is embarrassed about it. We don't talk about it much. I am the only one to initiate this conversation. When I do, he just says it's like a mental block, and he is nervous to disappoint me. The relationship, in my opinion, is deteriorating. He's never said that it was, but that's how I feel. Maybe he does, but he doesn't state it. He is just so dismissive of things, but when it comes to his problems, I am always willing to listen. He isn't. He just seems to get irritated. All I want is someone to hear me for once and not immediately dismiss what I'm feeling. I am an anxious person, I get that, but I don't think that gives him the right to invalidate me. I just want someone who will listen. He doesn't have to solve it. Just hear me like I do with him. We feel more like roommates, and the only time I feel like we are a couple is when I fake it. I do love him, I just wish there was more communication. He is a good guy he is just emotionally stunted. He also had a difficult family life. It seems he didn't get much support and affection. I want it to work out with him, but I don't know if it's a lost cause. I just don't know anymore. I feel weird because I rely on him for rent since I make so much less than him, but I have a home back in my old state where I would be able to make significantly more than in my new state. I feel alone here. \n\nTL;DR\nMy boyfriend is dismissive of my feelings because I suffer from anxiety. We don't have much sex, I think he may have erectile dysfunction. I don't know whether I should call it quits and move back home or try to continue the relationship. He makes significantly more than me, but I could always move back home where I have a home to go to and a hiring paying job available. I just feel alone.",

My little brothers Ryan and Matthew stay up literally all night playing video games while talking loudly to their friends it’s so fucking annoying. \n\nThey have school in the morning too but they still stay up half the night playing video games. I honestly wouldn’t care if they weren’t so damn loud. I actually went out and slept in my car last night because he wouldn’t shut up. I’ve tried unplugging the router but he just plugs it back in, my dad barely does anything. Also my dad snores extremely loud, so loud that I can hear him downstairs with his door closed so I have to fall asleep before him. \n\nAnyway, my brothers set their alarms for 4am but they don’t actually wake up so their alarm just goes off continuously for like an hour. My dad sets his alarm for 5am, immediately after which he comes downstairs and starts making a racket. I really don’t know what to do, the only times I’m able to sleep is when my brothers stay at my moms house every week. I’ve thought about just staying at my moms house while they’re here but she lives 40 minutes away from my job. I think I’m going crazy.\n\nTL;DR I'm losing sleep because my family won't be quiet at night",

        "text": "Tl;dr: I'm worried my current boyfriend and I are just incompatible at our core. Is he losing interest in the relationship? Or, are we just incompatible?\n\nMy current boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year. When we met, I was not in the mental space to be in a relationship, as my previous relationship just ended a few months prior. That being said, I was very attracted to him, I thought he was cool guy (based on what I had known of him since we did try dating a couple months years prior), and he expressed how much he wanted to try things and make it work so I decided to go for it. We do live in different cities in the same state, so I'd say we are \"long distance-ish\" since our flights are only about 45 mins and see each other pretty often (every 2-3 weeks). \n\nThere were a few things that concerned me at the start of our relationship, however, at the time they weren't means for completely breaking everything off:  \n\n\nExample #1: I introduced him to a couple I knew so that we could start building new friendships with couples.  We all met up at a local bar on a Sunday afternoon and the entire time he was pretty quiet. I was still pretty understanding of that considering he didn't know them, but what really made me concerned was after the meetup. We all decided to get pizza and he wasn't really a fan of pizza at the time considering he doesn't like cheese or meat. So, he decided to get food at a place across the street. Instead of bringing the food back to the pizza place, he sat at the other restaurant and ate there leaving me at the restaurant alone and wondering where he was for 30-45 mins. When he finally came back, I'd asked him where he was and he mentioned very confidently that he ate at the other restaurant since he doesn't eat pizza and saw nothing wrong with the fact that he didn't communicate he was going to be doing that or just how socially it was pretty interesting to leave the people you're with to go eat alone.\n\nThe example above is just one of many that I have experienced that left me feeling extremely confused. \n\nIt's just been heavy on my heart that we are two completely different people and I'm starting to question if we are even friends at our core since friends actually have shared interests, shared humor, etc. Since the start of our relationship, he struggled with initiating communication ie facetime, calls but had no issue with texting. Several days would go by and I'd get no phone call and it left me feeling like I was in a relationship by myself. I brought it up and it has gotten better since, however, I find that we don't even have much to talk about when he does call. He is also someone who lives very differently than I do. He works from home and in bed most of the day, plays videogames as soon as he gets off, and then watches a tv show after while making and heating up frozen foods. He's also been in one romantic relationship 10 years ago that lasted about a year and has only had \"situationships\" since. On the other hand, I am someone who needs communication to feel close to my partner. By no means do I need to be texting all day, but I would like a call daily to just talk and catch up. I also consider myself to be more adventurous in the sense that I like creating new memories with my partner whether be going out and trying new restaurants together or even staying home and just cooking a meal together. I've also been in 3 long term relationships over the course of my life to put things into perspective. \n\nThis past week, I flew to his city and worked there the entire week. One of the days, we drove down to his office to work there together and decided to grab food when we both got off. It was a very rainy day, and as we were walking back to his office from the restaurant to grab his car from his work building, I reached out to grab his hand since I was cold and I just wanted to hold hands. He immediately goes \"what are you doing?\" and I reply \"just reaching out for your hand..im cold\". and replies \"that's what pockets are for\".   \n\n\nSince then, I can't help but to think that something is seriously wrong with our relationship. Although the example above is as simple as hand holding, I've never felt so emotionally distant from someone. He doesn't like calling (doesnt see the need for it especially daily), he isn't very romantic unless its literally valentines day or I mention that he hasn't done something in a while, and it just seems like there's no true desire to be with me anymore since efforts are pretty low at this point. I've even noticed he won't text \"goodmorning/goodnight\" or even say \"I love you\" as much anymore. I planned on moving to his city when my lease it up in about 6 months, but not I'm unsure if it's worth it at this point to even stay in the relationship. We're also in week 3 of pre-marital counseling but there's no way I could marry someone like this. \n\nAre we just incompatible? Am I missing the signs that something more/deeper is going on?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHelp!",

        "text": "ello,\n\nsorry      for posting here as a male. I just learned today that there are     studies  showing, that women on birth control prefer less masculine men.   I also found a reddit post from a womens experience which supported  the claim. What I am worried about is, that when me  and   my   girlfriend met over two years ago (I was 21, she was 19) she  was     starting birth control. I am not insecure, however I do  acknowledge   that   my face is a bit on the softer side. Obviously what I  am worried   about   is that once she gets off, there is a change she  will loose   all the   attraction.\n\nJust  an   insight, birth   control did not affect anything in terms of  behavior,   skin etc. Her   libido was the same (she used to masturbate  like 2   times a week and that   is what we started with), but started    increasing as we were becoming   more compatible with sex. We did not    start great, but slowly we became   very compatible and now we have sex    about 7-11 times a week. She often   gets turned on from the way I  look   at her or behave, which is good, but I   am afraid getting off  the  birth  control one day might fuck this up.  The  guys she was  attracted  to  previously were not really high  testosterone  looking,  but she was   young.\n\nI   wonder,  what do you   think about this? Do you have any experience? Do  you   really think   attractiveness to someone can grow overtime based on    behavior and can   be less look dependent? Thank you\n\nTL-DR: I met my girlfriend when she was on birth control and today I learned that it might affect her preferences. Worried that once she stops she will stop being attracted to me.",

        "text": "Me (19F) and my boyfriend (20M) have been together for 3 years. For the first two years, things seemed good and happy and all. But this past year, everything just seems to be going downhill. \n\nLike I said, everything was going good for about the first two years. I hit a really rough point in august of last year, depression &amp; anxiety. That’s when I began noticing that I’m not sure if he’s there for every season in life. \n\nBefore hitting my own rough patch though, I started to notice a few differences in him as time was progressing. He started complaining a lot more (about literally everything), very little communication about how he was feeling, always acting like the world was coming down on him, little motivation to move forward in life after high school, seems to want to be sexual a majority of the time, a bunch of broken promises, and for me it seemed like he would stomp on my parade just because he didn’t have anything to celebrate. \n\nThese things have been brought up through conversations, which ended up leading to arguments because he would just say “well I guess I’m just the shittiest boyfriend ever…,” but after the argument he would change/work on himself for about a week, then it would go back to exactly how it was. \n\nTo add on-top of it all, his family has treated me like complete crap through a majority of our relationship. I have talked to him about it, even to the point where I’m balling crying, and he’ll just sit there like I’m not hurting from their comments. (Their comments include that I’m privileged, rich, talking their son away, and even to the point when his father yelled at me about it all). Even though I’m a complete stranger to all of you, I can stand firm in the fact that I never have been disrespectful towards them in any shape or form. \n\nI have recently talked to him about all of this and explained that I feel like we’re both growing in separate directions, which now he is starting to attempt to change, but admitted that it was because I was about to to break up with him. \n\nI’m just confused on what to do/how to go about it all. Do I break up with him or do I stay and see if things get better as he’s trying to change? This past year has been hard, and I think this has lead to my depression and a anxiety also, so I’m just conflicted. \n\nTL;DR: I feel like my boyfriend and I are growing apart because of how he acts within his life. He’s trying to change but I just feel conflicted on how things will be in the long term. How should I go about it? Leave or stay for the change?",

        "text": "TLDR: Engaged, planning to get married soon. My partner is ridiculously jealous of any female presence in my life without any proof of wrongdoing and she verbally abuses me for it. However, she talks/hangs out with lots of guys and she even tells me about it. She never accepted to explain why there’s this double standard. How should I proceed?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello Reddit, I set up this throwaway account to post this message. I am in pain and torture, and I feel too ashamed to share this with anybody I know.\n\nI have been with my fiancee (let's call her Cindy) for 5 years. We recently got engaged. We are planning to get married very soon. Cindy tends to be overly jealous of any female presence in my life. It got to a ridiculous level: For example, if I follow a popular singer/actor/comedian female on IG or FB, she gets really really mad at me and she automatically thinks I want to have an affair with them. And then I have to unfollow them. Bear in mind, I never cheated so there's no precedent for that but she's always extremely paranoid of any female presence in my life.\n\nRecently, things spiraled out of control when I told her that my almost-teenage (female) cousin texted me to get some help with something and I responded to her text to give her that help (we're talking about a 1 text response here). She thought that somehow this was inappropriate and that I was interested in her (!!). We were talking on the phone when I told her I was sending a text to my cousin (thinking that this is totally fine, because it is!), and she got mad, hung up on me on the spot and later verbally abused me over text by calling me a cheat and to go f\\* myself. That's when I started feeling really bad about the situation. And with the verbal abuse, I felt extremely humiliated. Verbal abuse happens with her when she feels very mad, for example she loudly told me in public to shut the f\\* up when I was simply suggesting some instructions to operate the camera (and we weren't even fighting, so felt really WTF). After the cousin incident, she did not even try to apologize or to admit she overreacted. And for the verbal abuse, when I asked her if she thought she crossed a line, she said she didn't know. But then, she texts me telling me she loves me. She did say she was sorry (but again she did not know if she crossed a line). She asked me to validate her concern over me responding to my cousin’s text to help her, I said that was a bit exaggerated that you are jealous of her (I can't even be with my cousin!). She felt I was dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe baseless cheating accusations have become a part of my life, but the problem is that they don't even make sense. For example, when I tell her I am traveling to a place for work, she tends to be \"convinced\" that I am traveling to see some girl at the destination and then I have to constantly film where I am to prove that I am not with anybody. Bear in mind, that I am a guy with a very boring daily life routine, I just work and then go home/hotel. I am very introverted and I don't even go to social gatherings, bars, etc.\n\nNow let's move on to weird part that's **really really** perplexing me: Cindy is actually extremely open with guys. She always chats with guys that I don't know (and she sometimes tells me she's chatting with X or Y as they are friends) and I never even made anything of it because I've always trusted her. I don't even have any female friend and she would never be OK with me even having female acquaintances. Is there something she is projecting here? I am truly perplexed, because my reasoning is: if Cindy thinks it's so wrong to have any opposite gender presence in one's life, why does she allow it for herself? When I bring this up (when she starts fighting with me over a female presence), she tells me that I am just chaging the subject and trying to frame myself as the victim. But I only bring this up to tell her that trust is a two-way street, and that she needs to trust me just like I trust her when she talks to guys I don't know.\n\nMy dilemma is that I really really love Cindy. We have had euphoric moments together and she's just an amazing person (except for the things I mentioned earlier). I find it so hard to end things with her. She thinks that this is just a bump on the road.",

        "text": "Always go to Reddit for anonymous advice so here it is: We are both seniors in highschool and we’re in a club. We went on a trip to a different state with the club that has around 25 people. It is 7th graders to 12th graders. Everything was normal on the way there, it was about a 3 hour drive. Everyone was talking in the back two rows, all was well. The day after we got the the hotel it was late and I was in a room with her and 3 other people. Nothing I’m up of the ordinary, just a couple friends hanging out. The next day we left and it was already dark. This was a rather big van with 16 seats total, the back row has four seats, she sat on the far right side. The next row had two seats on the left and one on the right with an aisle in between, I sat in the seat on the right in the second to last row. The next was the same and the rest doesn’t matter. We just left a restaurant we stopped at on the way home and she asks if I want a doughnut bite (like a munchkin but a little bigger) and I say sure, she grabs one and holds it in front of me. It was close enough to my face where I could just stick my head out and grab it so I’m in a goofy mood why not? I do it, she laughs I smile. We are all talking for a while and I’m getting tired so I sit back and go to lean my head back against the seat and her arms were wrapped around the head rest so she could lean forward and talk. When I felt her arms I leaned forward a bit and looked back and she was just looking at me. Said nothing for like 3-5 seconds and I put my head back because whatever, I’m tired. After about a minute, everyone is still talking she starts scratching my head. Now I don’t know what was happening but it was really relaxing. Kid to my left(17M) says “ay yo what’s goin on?” Referring to her scratching my head. She says oh I’m scratching his head, I do it to my brother all the time, etc. and offers it to him for a minute and he agrees. She scratches his head for a minute and stops. She sits down in the back seat and looks at her phone for a second. When she put her phone down she goes to wrap her arms back around the chair to continue talking so I move my head forward and she wraps her arms around the head rest and I put my head back. Some people decided to take a nap so we aren’t talking as much. It’s quiet for about 30 seconds and I turn around to look at her and she again, just stares at me for about 5-10 seconds. I said something along the lines of the head scratching felt nice, it was relaxing, etc. so she starts doing it again. Goes for about 10 more minutes until we get back to the school. We unpack our stuff and everyone goes home. The next day I message her and we talk for around 2 1/2 hours, all is well. This is my dilemma, it is now 1am Thursday and she just didn’t respond again after Monday night. It was through discord and since I’m on a computer all the time I have discord on a second monitor and I look at it all the time. She just hasn’t been online, she doesn’t play video games on a computer or even has one to my knowledge so I don’t think she’s setting herself to offline. The last message I sent was one text, asking how she was because she got hurt on the trip, didn’t realize how bad it was, went to the doctor, and is now in crutches. That was on Tuesday and from then I have just left it alone. I’ve never really “been around the block” per say so I have no idea what any of this means but I do know the more I think about it the more it’s driving me crazy. Is she just being friendly? Am I seeing this from a completely different perspective than her? Am I crazy? I don’t want to look back on this in 2 years and be like damn it was obvious so here I am. All advice welcome.\n\nTL;DR: I have no idea if a girl is flirting with me or not and it driving me crazy, don’t want to regret not doing anything but don’t want to assume over nothing.",

I was drunk and sad, and was trying to do something to regain control of the situation and my emotions. I didn’t even feel sexually attracted to him. I never saw him again, and I immediately knew that I would never have casual sex again. \n\nWhen I moved home after the summer, I ended up reaching out to my then ex and asking to get back together. I was in a better place mentally, and a lot of the problems we had before had subsided. When we first spoke, he asked me if I had been with anyone else while we were broken up - I lied and said no. At the time, I really wanted to protect him from that hurt, and I wanted to protect myself from his criticisms as well. \n\nWe have been officially back together for 3 months, and I still haven’t told him. For most of this time, I didn’t really think about it. I didn’t think that I owed him any details of what I did when we were separated, especially since I knew that it meant absolutely nothing and that this break up was never about me losing interest or wanting to see other people. But recently I’ve been feeling guilty. I feel like I’ve been deceitful. I genuinely have no idea whether me hooking up with someone else would have impacted his decision to get back with me or not. However I feel that it’s possible that he would feel that way, and I don’t want to continue to not be honest about my past. \n\nWhat should I do? I don’t know if I’m just going to be hurting him for no reason, or if he has a right to know what happened. At this point, I feel more guilty about lying than I do about having hooked up with someone while broken up. \n\n\nTLDR; I had sex with someone while broken up with my partner, and lied about it when we got back together. Should I tell him?",

However, when it comes to household chores, the responsibility falls mainly on myself.\n\nFor example: I will do all the washing, folding, ironing, meal planning, cooking, cleaning up after dinner, packing/unpacking the dishwasher, cleaning the bathroom, vacuuming/mopping, running errands, taking out the trash, paying the utilities, and going to the grocery store. I only ask that he takes out the trash but it usually piles up and I end up doing it anyway.\nHe will occasionally cook dinner 2-3 times a month.\n\nTo be honest, I don’t mind being responsible for the household chores and cooking but, it doesn’t seem right that I should do it all AND have to pay 50/50.\n\nSo what’s the fairest way to split expenses?\n\nTL;DR: Wanting to split the bills fairer considering I do all the household chores",

I am going to show him this post.\n\nHe tells me that he does not feel like a 'true' man because I cried and told him off instead of validating his feelings or vulnerability.\n\nContext: He told me he does not feel manly if he is not allowed to flirt with other women. He said his body reaction when he sees a pretty/hot girl, as he quoted, is volatile. So, he feels the need to prove himself to be a man who can do it, and wants to go up to them and flirt with them and get their number.\n\nWhen he said this, I broke down and started crying. I told him how much it hurt me to hear that from someone who claims to love me and I so love deeply. He justified it by saying he will always love me and I will be the 'queen', no matter what. it's just 'what men of his caliber do' implying successful attractive me do that and even sleep with other women, but he won't do that to me. At least not in front of me, because he 'respects me'. He even asked me to honor the fact that he is not cheating on me physically, which 'all men do' apparently.\n\nAfter I cried. I told him I can't be in such a relationship. I mean won't wanna invest in something with someone like that? I have standards and boundaries. I said this will be the shortest relationship for me. He said that I do not love him enough to let him do that and I do not respect him because I threatened to leave when I promised I would never do it again.\n\n(little backstory: In the past. I did say I wanted to break up multiple times with him to be fair because we were not in a relationship, and I wanted that.) and to be fair, I feel like saying that really broke his trust and hurt him. I did not mean to ever hurt him. I just cannot be with someone like that. He said i am throwing away this entire relationship because of one small stupid thing...\n\nI do not want to leave this man as I love him so much. He makes me feel like a princess in all the other aspects.\n\nPlease, I need some advice and your opinion on this. What do I do? I feel as though I hurt him, and he hurt me. How can I approach this with an open mind? I sit here crying as I am writing this. I am desperate.\n\nTLDR: I invalidated my boyfriend's feelings by not wanting him to express himself as a man to flirt with other girls, and I said wanted to leave because I felt disrespected. I hurt him.",

        "text": "Backstory: So, my brother(28m) got married to his girlfriend (27m) about three years ago. I hadn’t spoken to her until a few months before their marriage. She seemed very sprightly and kinda excited about things in general which I liked. She also grew in a well-to-do family, on the other hand we lived in constant financial crisis until my brother started his first job a couple of years ago. We and her are from India and post marriage they both moved to the US (that’s where they did their Masters.)\nSo, my mother and I visited them once in 2021 and stayed for about 2 months. I alone visited again and I’m currently in their house as I type this. \n\n\n\nThe story: So, a couple of things keep happening and I’m not sure how to react to it because I find it challenging to deal with it. \n\nFor example, \n\nIncident1: My brother and I used to jam to music quite often, so I asked my brother if we should jam and we started doing that. My sister-in-law (SIL) was very uninterested in music so she nagged a bit that we don’t do it and immediately she started asking us to help her with her plants and gardening. It felt so bad and weird. I later told him that music was his passion and he shouldn’t let that be tampered by anyone. \n\nIncident2: Their house is usually messy. She one day started sorting everything in the house. She asked my mum if she needed the hair-clip that lying on the table, and my mom said she would use it in a bit. After about an hour, she wasn’t talking to anyone and was behaving very quiet like she is mad. It was me, my brother, my mum and her in the house. So I thought it was may be too overwhelming for her. After my brother took her to a different room, she told him that my mum hasn’t used the clip and it is still lying there. When my brother confronted that it’s not a big issue, she started crying and then called up her mother and made my brother talk to her. He told them the issue, and then they kinda told her it’s not big problem. She got normal after a bit and we all later had a good time. But occasionally in those weeks, she used to get quiet all of a sudden for a bit and then the whole house used to get weirdly quiet until my brother spoke to her. My mom got very upset multiple times because she didn’t understand what happened and once my mom cried and told her that if she doesn’t communicate and remains silent the whole time then she would go back to India. \n\nShe was the one who invited us to their house because she wanted me and my mom to see the US because we hadn’t been before. She used to make plans and we used to go travel many places, which make her seem like a nice good-hearted person but then things happen where it seems like she wants everything to happen like she wants it. She recently said No to something and ask her normally“Why?”, and she said “what do you mean Why?” like I must listen to her and not ask any questions. It feels so uncomfortable staying in the house when I visit but I come for my brother mostly. She would crack jokes on other but dislikes when someone cracks on her, though now she is getting slightly better, or may be idk. \n\nI don’t understand what kind of a person she is and the fact that she’s my brother’s wife makes it more complicated. I’m used to living in a more free environment where I like people to communicate thoroughly but here it feels something’s wrong. \nWhat do you people think about her or am I judging her too much? Also, how would you deal with a person like this? I am open to listen to anything and assess it. Thank you for reading and helping out in advance :)\n\n\n\nTLDR: My brother is recently married to his girlfriend and after about a year me and my mom visited them in the US (we’re from India). She used to remain quiet whenever things didn’t happen according to how she wanted. She cracks jokes on everyone, but doesn’t like to be cracked on her. She is otherwise a good person, who cares and stuff. I’m having a tough time understanding how to deal with her or accept her as a part of my life. Thanks.",

I really love her but I have to let her go and I hate it. I haven't take her out to a very fancy dinner as she really wants it. Should I do that and then talk to her another say after the dinner? Should I just be straight up her saying I stil have to work alot and can't give all my time to her everytime just to go see her? It is not meeting once or twice a week should do as we are use to seeing each other everysay and doing that now would hurts but bottom line is she is not compatible and greatest for my careers.\n\nTLDR\nI need to breakup with my girlfriend as she is not the greatest for my future.

After she broke up with her boyfriend I noticed more of these hits but never really pursued anything further out of fear of ruining our friendship.

She talks about how she likes other guys around me and it hurts to see someone I really like sort of shop around for a new boyfriend.

Recently he has been avoiding me and ignoring me because he feels I'm taking him for granted and and it's always him who initiates conversations. And him only who drives the conversation. If he won't step up and take charge of conversation our conversation falls flat. While i know where he is coming from, and i understand sometimes i fall silent in between conversations, but that doesn't mean i don't appreciate him and his efforts, i  have a lot of feelings for him and i love him so much but it becomes difficult for me to express my feelings to him sometimes. Even during at the initial of the relationship. I had major communication issues, and it was a constant topic during our disagreements too. But we had our way around it and resolved our conflicts with ease. But now after 3 years he says, he has given up over the fact that there is even a scope of improvement in me and my ability to understand him. He also says he now has 0 expectations from me and will now be putting 0 efforts going forward. I know i fucked up. But i just don't know how to improve myself. Because i thought i was improving but it's obvious i was only hurting him along the way. I feel like I just can't be redeemed. But i really do care about him and i don't take him at all for granted. I loved each and everytime he used to call, I'm so giddy with joy whenever I see his name flash across my screen.  It's just that i sometimes am not engaging in conversations. I become passive and just like to listen to me him. Please help me how to bridge in this gap between us. Because i honestly don't know what i am doing wrong.\n\nTldr: My boyfriend says i suck at communication, and it's high time he should stop investing effort in me and have 0 expectations from me as this has drained him dry.",
