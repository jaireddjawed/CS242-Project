        "text": "Me and 3 other girls from work (were all in our late 20s) started all hanging out outside of work together a few months ago; we had a couple girls nights and we have lots of fun together. I felt I found my niche at work. And prior to this none of us ever hung out it was a new group for everyone involved.\n\n1 of the girls is getting married in the summer. The other 2 are standing for her and I’m not. Which is fine, I’m not a big fan of being a bridesmaid but it’s clear I’m the odd one out. Though I’m not standing, I’m the only coworker that got invited to the wedding. \n\nA few days ago I was on shift with the bride and 1 of the other girls. The three of us were looking at wedding dresses on the computer as we had down time. Two patients had walked in to be triaged and it was my turn to go see what they needed. So I said “Oh I’ll go get these ones!” And the 1 girl (not the bride) said “yeah you can, we’re looking at dresses.” I made a face that was obviously upset and just said “oh ok, got it” and as I got up to leave she clearly felt bad and was like “well I can go do those it’s ok!” And I said no it’s fine. I felt so silly but, I was quite hurt and trying to fight back tears.\n\nShe also made a stink the day before as she saw I requested the wedding day off on the upcoming schedule and said to me in front of people at work “If you get that off over me you better switch with me because I’m standing.” (I would likely get it off over her as I do have more seniority). I said I was trying to get it off because there’s a chance we’ll all be granted it off, but ya sure I’ll switch with you. I later felt bad about it and erased my name from those days.\n\nAnyway I feel very left out and this 1 girl is just being super nasty with me.\n\nI recently found out I’m not invited to the bachelorette either. I just find it very weird because we all hang out nothing seems to be wrong but I’m suddenly not invited to things when the other 2 are. \n\nDo I drop these people as friends? Do I say something about feeling left out and hurt?",

We talked for a few days I asked her out and she agreed. Then after a few days she stopped texting me back.

I already accepted that I got it wrong and I'm not trying to \"stay friendly until she realizes she likes me\" or something like that, but I would like to keep her as a friend because she was actually pretty funny and we had a couple of common interests, considering also I had virtually no friends, and I need more social connection.

        "text": " I've noticed that there's a specific type of phrases / words which allow a person to completely devalue anything which someone else says to them by simply repeating that phrase back to them over and over again. I don't know if there's a specific term for those words, so I'll call them \"**blockers**\" for convenience's sake, since **they block communication**.\n\nI think blockers are kinda fascinating because they are entirely illogical: it doesn't matter what you say or how you say it, blockers nullify anything which comes in contact with them. They exist beyond semantics and are based on how people engage in communication on a subconscious level. When we communicate we expect a basic level of validation and effort of trying to understand what the other person says. Blockers give zero validation and require no effort to use.\n\nI notice that blockers are more popular with children because, again, those are very simple ways to dominate the discussion without engaging in any rational or logical discourse. It's like closing your ears with hands and repeating \"I can't hear you\", but in a more subtle way.\n\nWhat makes a blocker? I think it's not a specific meaning but the way the word is used. If it's getting repeated many times to every response, then the word / phrase acts like a blocker in a conversation. The opposite is also true: if the phrases like \"who asked\" or \"who cares\" are applyed in a due context and provided with other arguments those stop being blockers and get their original meaning back. Basically it's not really about the word itself, but the person you're talking to.\n\nHow do you deal with blockers? I think it depends on the context. If you talk to someone who uses blockers on the Internet then ignoring and blocking people who use blockers as soon as possible is probably the easiest way to deal with them, but it might take time to make it a habit. What about real life? If you have to deal with people who use blockers against you on a regular basis then I think it becomes a form of bullying, and I recommend asking and reading other people's advice on how to deal with bullies.",

        "text": "I am not sure if I would be in the right, and people seem to have mixed opinions on this. In a college, there are usually areas around the buildings by classrooms with seating/tables. Usually, this area is dead silent, because everyone there is working on homework, studying, or doing another quiet activity. This is *technically* a public space and not a quiet zone, but most people are working quietly. Occasionally, this silence will be broken by classes changing, or one or two people talking loudly. This only lasts a couple minutes, and usually they go somewhere else and the silence returns. Most people seem to make an effort to speak in a hushed tone. \n\nToday, I was at the end of the hallway at one of these spots doing my work quietly and a group of 6 or 7 students decided to stand right next to me and have a very loud conversation. Despite being next to offices and classrooms, they loudly made fun of other students and professors, bursting into laughter. Two of the group members talked over each other and got progressively louder, bordering on what is considered shouting. \n\nI thought that they were just waiting for class to begin so I didn't bother them and waited for them to leave, but they stood there for like 20 minutes so I got up and left. Today I was lucky, as there was a single table open on the other side of the building. Usually, though, every seat is taken and it is difficult to find somewhere to sit. For whatever reason, it is really hard to find a place to work on my campus, as every seat and table are usually taken in almost every building, **and our library is currently being renovated, so there is very limited space.** \n\nWere these people in the wrong for moving next to me to socialize while I was studying (I had been there a while)? Or are they entitled to have a conversation in what is technically a public area? I was afraid to ask them to lower their voices because I didn't want to act overly entitled or controlling, but I also felt disrespected. Normally, I go out of my way to not disturb anyone studying in an academic area, and I thought that was the norm. What is the expectation here? Would it be rude for me to ask them to quiet down?",

For some reason\\* I didn't drink alcohol when hanging out with them. For some reason\\* I may have even looked like I wasnt happy being with them or that I faked being happy while hanging out with them. For some reason\\* many such instances occured and I may have seemed odd, weird or disinterested with them.\n\n\\*That reason was that for the past 5 months I have been extremelly suicidal and, unbeknownst to myself, had depression. I have had 2 failed suicide attempts and several instances of self harm. All of this took a huge toll on my mental health and cripled my already weak social skills. I remember once there was a party, I was invited by my acquaitances, but I refused citing \"doctors visit\", while in reality I had to go to a mental hospital to get prescribed antidepressants and to find out my condition.\n\nI have no clue how to explain all of this if questions were to arise or i felt comfortable enough with them to \"spill the beans\" about what I have been going through for the past months. I think my main fear is that I will scare them away or something.",

Going to be fun living with him. could tell I gave everyone really weird vibes, people flighty to even say bye to me. \n\nI had no friends for years where I used to live and tried and failed to build social circles. I thought starting collage here would be different. nope, I tried really hard to go to school held social events but I would get there try to talk to people, fail and leave.\n\nI used to be really social, when I was a kid I would hangout with a group of friends go to random parties get with girls, and just live the life I wanted to live (not that I at all want that now I just don't understand how from that I've become so awkward). but I've slowly lost friends to my declining social skills, I have become a different person and that person just can't interact with people anymore.\n\nI wish I could go back to being the social person I used to be, but I feel like a keep regressing. I take alot of notice to social cues and other things. But because of that I see things as almost a scoring system, where I try to win a social interaction by not being weird and feel like I've lost when I make it weird, idk, its hard to explain. But because of that I spiral the moment something in an interaction goes wrong and freak out.\n\nI can't even list the endless amount of times, even just in this new city, where I can tell I've made a fool of myself, I wish I could just be normal. I feel like im playing a character, I can talk to people quiet well but then I slip and this super weird and awkward person just comes out and it leaves people thinking Im a grifter, hiding something. Again idk, I hope this makes sense. People tell me that I come off as incredibly strange because of this.\n\nIdk, this doesn't make much sense.

        "text": "Hi. So I’m not sure if I am the only one that feels this way, but I can read people easily to the point where I become paranoid and overanalyze my actions. I become too alert and anxious with how I act towards a person especially when I have already read a person’s intention, feelings, and opinion about me. When I first meet a person, I can instantly read almost everything about them by the way they talk, move, and react when speaking to them. Moreover, when I start to get closer to a person, I tend to overanalyze their personality. Then, I already input a opinion that they might have about me in their head. After having a conversation or hanging out with an individual, I start to backtrack and get random flashbacks of my actions. It then leaves me into a spiral where almost the whole day I cringe about the way I acted or the things I said. I then become disappointed in myself asking myself “Why did I say it like that?” or “Why did I do that?” Overall, I feel like I’m too alert with how a person acts to the point where I begin to beat myself up. This has led me to distancing myself with people and having little to no friends. I then stopped being friends with a lot of my former friends because I already know what they think of me. I get scared interacting with new people especially pretentious people. It leads me to stutter, laugh awkwardly, and to force a fake smile. It’s hard to truly be myself because of this and I don’t know what to do. Do any of you relate to this?",

(they hang out in our room and not my suitemate's room because the computer is in here to play games)\n\nthey will even sometimes allow THEIR friends in here while i am in here. and then they will leave together and say bye to me but not invite me. it feels very strange. like they are only friendly with me so they have somewhere to hang out. like i am being taken advantage of. \n\ni have hung out with them and their friends outside of the dorm a couple of times, but i am still not included in things like group chats and such. and they do not invite me when they (VERY RARELY) hang out in their friends dorms, despite being in the same room as me for the entire rest of the day. \n\n(i should also mention that i have struggled with social anxiety since high school, and i have always struggled with being included with friends. this is not the kind of situation i am good at navigating in the first place. and i think they can sense my lack of social skills)\n\ni'm completely fine with my roommate being in here because it is obviously her room too. but my suitemate is in here too and they are talking together, laughing together, and showing each other things on their phones without engaging me in their conversations \n\ni find myself going to the library when i don't have classes just to avoid being in my own room. i feel constantly uncomfortable there. this is the worst case scenario for someone with social anxiety 😭\n\ni don't know what to do for the rest of the semester. i have been trying to become more comfortable around them but have been unsuccessful. i have also been trying to make new friends since August but have been unsuccessful. i would really really like to have at least some good experiences/memories before i transfer next semester. what should i do to accomplish this??\n\n\n\ni hope that i explained this well. like the heading says, it's a very strange situation.",

However, I always feel like I’m not sure of if most of them see me as a friend yet, mainly because my social skills suck and I find myself struggling to contribute to conversations sometimes, but I do try.\n\nMy mind will always go blank, making it difficult to start a conversation or contribute to one, and even when I have something to say I struggle to bring myself to say it. This has led to me feeling like I don’t deserve to be in their company since I don’t feel like I contribute enough, yet none of them seem to mind me hanging with them at the very least.\n\nHow can I make myself struggle less with this sort of thing?",

I just moved here in the US, so sometimes when I talk, the english gets messed up but I try to have a good grammar most of the time. I'm a person that doesn't really have much friends but I have a few (2-3) real ones whom I can rely on back in the Philippines. I don't really consider myself like an extrovert who goes extra mile to interact with other people, but when I click with someone, I really do have good bonds with them. I notice I have a problem that if I'm the newbie in a social circle, I'll have a very difficult time to connect with them since the group is bonded already. Unless there's a new one too, then I'll be able to talk to someone. \n\nNow the thing is I have a job here in the US. I don't really talk to them first because I'm shy since they already have their social circle. When they ask me something, I try to talk as much as possible to engage conversation more. But then I realize after one question they don't talk to me anymore. When I respond, sometimes I respond in an English not in line with how they talk here. I do seem to see that I sound awkward/weird since my grammar sometimes gets messed up. \n\nI start to become very lonely at work because no one really talks with me. They'd talk with each other but not me. They don't even look at me and we're literally in one room (my job involves remote work in a room). They don't make effort to include me in the conversation. When I try to butt in, they'd just acknowledge me once then move on. \n\nI'm starting to feel like I'm a weirdo. But am I? or I'm just new to western culture?",

Like I did something horrible. And I was like jeez I didn't realize asking that was going to cause such a big reaction. They all besides one of them left the chat shortly after (they mentioned they were all about to dip before I asked that question). The one that stayed on said haha I thought it was funny, I think everyone was just piling on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll these guys are also in a text group chat together. I am not in it which makes total sense since I just recently started playing online and they've been doing it for literally years. One of my really good friends in that chat that was not gaming online texted me, \"dude what did you say about this guy.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike now all these guys are even texted about what I said. I asked him to send me screenshots and he said its really nothing, just said something vague, and that they are just saying I took a shot at that one kid. He wouldn't just send me a screenshot of what was said so part of me thinks they are actually kinda saying some bad things and my friends wants to protect me and not show what is being said about me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I guess my question is - is it bad to say someone sounds like someone else? Is that some sort of social thing that is in general bad to say and I just had no idea? I was not at all expecting the reaction I got. Maybe in the text chat they are all just saying it jokingly, and my friend wouldn't send the screenshot because it really was nothing to really talk about - they just mentioned I said this online, talked about it briefly as a funny thing in a text chat and that's that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I type this I kinda am realizing maybe I am overthinking this, but I am not sure.

I've tried to look around for others with this problem, first starting online, but I find it overlaps with having no or few friends in general.\n\nNow, I have a good amount of friends (just guys with the exception of my sister, that's a whole other thing though), and I find that while it helps me care about their individual needs, I can't truly care about something greater than myself and them. \n\nThe two times I ever felt at home without literally being home were when I was a regular churchgoer and in an art class I took days before covid was a thing, but now that I question religion more and that class is over, I'm at a loss. Even with some efforts to change this (volunteering at the animal shelter, joining a nonprofit arts community), my reasons are solely dominated by self-interest (the desire to play with cats and the desire to get good at drawing) so I never truly take up the cause.

It was so funny seeing her blush, since I do that when I talk to people haha.\n\nToday, I saw her and thought she would’ve come up to me to say hi, but I guess she didn’t. I thought I pissed her off, but she seemed pretty happy. I think she gave me a smile, but I have no clue. I have a class with her tomorrow, what should I do? How do I approach her?",

Cycle repeats until I’m bright red.\n\nI know a lot of people think blushing is cute, myself included honestly.

        "text": "I need advice on how to handle this dynamic. There is a group of girls in my building in college who always hang out together. They used to talk to me, and we were/are acquaintances, but now they have kind of formed a clique and I'm not a part of it. I can't tell what they really think of me, but they are always walking around together, and I am never invited. \n\nToday, I was sitting alone in the dining hall, and they all went and sat at a table across the room. I waved at them when I was walking past, and one of them waved back. I considered going to sit with them, but then I decided not to because I felt like they wouldn't want me there and they didn't invite me to, but I felt sad and left out seeing them all hanging out together. \n\nI couldn't tell what I should have done. if I went and sat with them, I would feel like I was inserting myself into their group when I'm not wanted. But by not sitting with them, I felt like maybe I was being antisocial and this is why they never ask me to hang out with them. In the past when I have hung out with them, I have felt on the outskirts of the group and almost like they were just putting up with me there. \n\nI have always ended up as the person not in the clique. It has happened for my entire life. I have never really fit in well with my peers or had many friends. I get along better with people four or five years older than me than I do with people in my age (18F) \n\nFrankly, I am baffled as to what I should do in a situation like this, which I have been in so many times before. If there is a group of people who aren't openly rude, but they don't seem to be going out of their way to include you, should you be friendly to them, and that will make them let you into the group? or should you not waste your time on them? This particular group I have gotten so many mixed signals from. First I thought they liked me, but now they have formed a clique and never seem to want me to sit with them or anything. Why are people so fucking confusing all the time?",

I don’t know anyone there anymore, since my old gym buddies are no longer attending there.\n\nI’ve always been a shy and introverted person and I feel it has worsened and became a form of social anxiety, which prevents me from even getting the courage to say ‘hi’ to some people. \n\nAnd there’s also this guy that goes in the same timeframe I go and we have pretty similar workouts. I recently followed him on Instagram (which I don’t know if was a good idea) and he followed me back, but we never interacted. I really wanted to get to know him, for he seems to be a really chill dude.\n\nShould I interact with him on Instagram? Should I approach him in the gym despite my extreme nervousness in interacting with people (yes, I am almost always using headphones although I maybe shouldn’t)? I have a fear I might be too awkward and I’ve gotten pretty lonely in the past few months.\n\nThanks :)",

        "text": "It's no secret, everyone here is here because they aren't the best at conversation. So, it makes sense that you're, inevitably, going to do/say something that is awkward or embarrassing. There is a crucial step you have to learn to employ in these moments. Laugh. Embrace the awkward. Acknowledge that that was, indeed, a mistake, and move on, and it transitions 100x smoother. I had multiple of these just today at work. Let's go through them. \n\nScenario one. I've got a clump of trash in my hand and an open trashcan 10ft away from me. Plenty of people around. Instead of being passive and throwing my trash away like a normal human might. I decide to be goofy, announce \"From downtown\" and shoot it in. And I fucking missed, like hard. Embarrassing, right?\n\nWell. It would have been, if I tucked my head in, got rosy cheeked, and ran away without a word. But no. I laughed at my complete failure of a shot, as did other people who watched it, made a joke about how I'm still good enough for my local (terrible) NBA team, and that was that. Everyone enjoyed it, nothing was awkward, because I didn't MAKE it awkward. \n\nScenario 2. At my computer. Woman coworker comes up, never spoke before, she asks if I can watch over her people for a few minutes so she could \"pump\". I'm thrown off by this, so I'm like \"I'm sorry, you're going to do what?\" She gives me a bit of a awkward smirk and a \"You know, like breast milk?\" \"OH\" I say in suprise. Again, could be awkward, if I just covered my face, apologized, etc etc. What actually happened, was I laughed at myself, acknowledged that I'm an idiot and should have put that together, and we both laughed about it, she completely understood me not putting it together being a man, and that was that. Even laughed about it again later on.\n\nLearning to laugh at and acknowledge your mistakes is huge, it shows confidence in yourself and your situation. You're not doing anything different, literally just taking where you made a mistake, and changing your body language.",

This is stressing me out. How do I tell him that without hurting him? I think I need to be very direct because I have told him I am not interested and he still keeps trying.",

It's draining when people ask why I don't post anything or interact much.\n\nI don't know if I should stay on and try it out more or leave completely. Am I missing out on anything? I just don't get the appeal.\n\nI'm worried if I leave I'll have to compromise keeping in touch with some people. Am I going too far?",
