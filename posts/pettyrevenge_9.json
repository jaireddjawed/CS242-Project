        "text": "I ordered something off eBay and received an item that was not as described. It was a video game that was supposed to be sealed and a specific variation that made it worth  a bit of money. My eBay account is 22 years old and I've been collecting games for nearly 20 years so have a bit of experience doing this sort of thing.\n\nWhen I received the item and found that it was not the variation described in the listing I reached out to the seller and informed him and asked him if he would kindly take it back as his listing was set to no returns.\n\nGuy made a huge stink about it. The item he sold me was worth maybe $20-30 whereas the variation it was supposed to be was worth maybe $200. I paid $70 for it so it was not some crazy lucky find just run of the mill average boring stuff for a collector. Since I paid more than double what it was worth I didn't feel like eating the cost since the listing error was his mistake.\n\nWhen he appeared to not be willing to do the return I informed him that I will just be contacting eBay and that they will force the return. Seller started throwing around his ego calling me a \"whiny peasant\" for asking to return it because it was not as described. I did some research on the guy in the community and found out he was a pretty notorious scammer with a history of this kind of behavior. \n\nCalled eBay and got the return authorization along with a return address. So for my petty revenge I squirted fart spray over the cellophane and then taped it nice and airtight in bubble wrap before putting it in a box and sending it back to him. For anyone who has never smelled this stuff before I would say it is a mixture of diarrhea and 30-day unwashed vagina smell, absolutely putrid. Difficult to not gag when smelling.\n\nSo the glorious day came and he received the package. He wrote an extremely long message in the return message thread in eBay stating that he is not a rookie so he made sure he videotaped the unboxing .... So he got my prank \"on video\" and was demanding eBay make me recompensate him for the damage. \n\nI responded to the thread and gaslit him accusing him of pretending there was a bad smell to try and scam me out of getting my refund ...üòÇüòÇüòÇ eBay sided with me and gave me the full refund.\n\nI acknowledge that there is a small ethical issue here damaging the value of his game with fart smell, but it was only worth around 20 bucks anyways so I don't feel too bad. Shouldn't have called me a peasant üòÅ",

I honestly don't know where I found the time looking back. Anyhow, as a poor student I didn't have access to all the right tech for a class project. The library had some but they were in such demand it was difficult to get so as soon as I knew what I needed, I asked a classmate (call her Penny) to help me out and she agreed. I'd checked with Penny a few times prior to the meeting and we were good to go. \n\nAs you probably guessed Penny doesn't show. She doesn't answer texts, calls or emails. I frantically try to get in with the library but it's like a 2 week wait so I can't. I email my prof for an extension he denies it. She did the damn assignment without me. I end up with a B in the class which is not good in grad school.\n\nAbout 2 years later, I'm working in our field and Penny applies. She gets through an interview or two then has the group interview. I'm there. She tries a friendly approach with me that I shrug off. When decision time comes I pull for the other candidate hard. I even shared the story about her screwing me over. I'm pretty sure it's why they went with the other person.",

You only break out the official way when you‚Äôre being audited.\n\nI worked with my opposite, Matt, for a couple of years and it was great. We‚Äôd both stay 5 minutes after and arrive 5 minutes early to make sure we were both set up for our shifts and we got on well. \n\nEventually, someone on Matt‚Äôs shift quit, and because Matt was a good worker, he was transferred to the now empty position. Cue Andy. Andy had been at the company for 20~ years so he knew it all. Matt was training him up and he was set to be my new opposite. \n\nAndy‚Äôs shift overlapped with mine for an hour, so Andy would watch me for that hour and criticise how the official process was wrong. I had no idea what he meant, as I wrote the official process around how I did the role and had trained most people on it, including the person that originally trained Matt. \n\nMatt had suffered an injury a few months before, and unbeknownst to me, he‚Äôd changed how he did the process. It didn‚Äôt really matter, as like I say, there‚Äôs the official way and the easiest way, but Andy got a bee in his bonnet about this. \n\nAndy put in a complaint about me doing the process wrong, which confused my team leader, but we had a chat and deducted that Andy was an arsehole. The complaint went nowhere and eventually Andy was my full time opposite. I didn‚Äôt like him from the get go, but that complaint solidified it.\n\nCouple of months of pettiness go by (we had to leave 15 bolts for the next shift, I‚Äôd leave a 200 pack for Matt, but Andy was meticulously leave me 15 every day so I‚Äôd return the favour) and there‚Äôs a paperwork mishap. The team that writes the process guidelines needs to update every process, and for some reason, they only consult Andy‚Äôs shift. That day, every official process guideline became the way that the other shift did their job. My shift should have been consulted but we weren‚Äôt, bad job all around.\n\nAndy got his way, his process was ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù and I was now wrong. He decided to stay behind and watch me from a distance, then complain about me again, which royally fucked me off.\n\nAndy was an old boy, he had joint pains and issues fully doing the process, but he toughed it out. \n\nOne day I come in to Andy‚Äôs manager waiting for me. He wants me to agree to changing the process to suit Andy better. We would drill holes 1 and 2 and the person after us would drill hole 3, but with the way things were set up, it would be easier for Andy to drill holes 1 and 3, and let the other guy drill hole 2.\n\nI refused.\n\nI said that there‚Äôs no way I can drill hole 3, it doesn‚Äôt work for me. If Andy needs accommodations, he should be moved. I got into a big argument with his manager, but there was nothing they could do. The process stayed that way for the next ~2 years. I like to think that he suffered for the next year until he retired. \n\nI eventually got the process order changed back after showing my new opposite how efficient it was, weird that!\n\nI came to find out when I spoke to Matt one day that Andy had 0 friends in the business, no one liked him and he sat alone at lunch. Oh well.",

I have major issues with JK‚Äôs hateful rhetoric on twitter but I‚Äôve been obsessed with Harry Potter (more specifically with the idea of an entire magical world where I could be a damn wizard) I read all the books, played all the PS1 and old pc games, got merch of my Hogwarts house etc so when an open world Potter inspired RPG game was announced I was hyped the hell up because YES I can be a wizard! Then when JK gave up on keeping her big prejudiced trap shut and I read through what she was saying online (and who she was promoting) I felt sick to have ever looked up to her as an author‚Äîbut I still knew that I loved the fantasy world she‚Äôd created. I kept up with the trailers, teasers etc of the game and was posting on social media, excitedly theorising on what features could be in the game and what the plot could be, which of course summoned the social justice keyboard warriors who proceeded to spam me with vile messages about how much of disgusting person I am, how liking the Potter books and anything related to them made me a terf, how I should unalive myself, that I‚Äôm a transphobe etc. The best part? I wasn‚Äôt even planning on buying the game since its a lot of money for someone with a limited budget, I was probably going to watch a few streams of gameplay, but that was about it. Here‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt just block/report, why I decided to make it personal. I‚Äôm not cis, not even slightly, so after having to deal with years of gender dysphoria, body dysmorphia, unsupportive family members, doctors not listening to me etc being accused of transphobia was something I took very personally and decided that some petty revenge was warranted. So I took great joy in preordering a copy of the game for my PS4 (too broke for a PS5) and taking the time to send a screenshot of the order confirmation to every single person that insulted me along with a lovely little note informing them that, by the way, you‚Äôve been harrassing a trans person online and told them to commit unalive, which sounds a lot more transphobic that buying a videogames. Boy oh boy I‚Äôve never seen so many comments be deleted so quickly. Is it petty? yes. Do I regret it? No, I‚Äôm cackling like a little gremlin and feeling very smug at the moment and as a bonus I‚Äôm getting a game that let‚Äôs me be a F-ing wizard.",

So I talked to my manager about how I didn't want to do that work and it isn't the job I signed on for.

I agreed and worked the day, very professionally, but not killing myself to make it happen. \n\nAt 60min to show time, the lighting lead asked me to work follow-spot for the show.   I hate that particular job.  I wasn't interested in the artist, the spots they had were really good at creating lower back pain and if you had to pee mid-show, you better hope that your water bottle was empty.  So I said no and they replied with, \"But you have to do what I say!\"\n\n\"Um, nope. I'm sure that if you talk to 'manager' you'll find that I don't.\"\n\nSure enough, the manager comes up to me and asks, \"So you won't do follow-spot?\"\n\n\"Nope\"\n\n\"Ok, I guess we'll find someone else\"\n\nMan that show was the most stress free day at work I ever had.",

She liked being the 'smartest one in the room' if that's a good way to put it. \n\nWhen our friends went separate ways, so did we. I never heard from Missy again. That was until I had joined a facebook group. The facebook group belonged to a certain large fandom at the height of the fandom becoming a tv show on Netflix. Several people posted their cosplay photos, so I posted mine. All around good comments and everyone was very kind. Except one in particular I recognized. \n\nMissy. She had commented and insulted my makeup skills and laugh reacted the photo and went as far as insulting my gender (I am FTM and was cosplaying a male character). I responded to reintroduce myself to her. She was shocked it was me and I tried playing nice and asking how she was. She ended up blocking me. \n\nA few months later, I saw her husband post something on facebook about Missy being in the running for a huge social media contest and she was actually in the top 50. The prize? 50k. I checked out her 'profile' on the contest site and it was self written, speaking about how kind she is and how non-judgmental she is. I had a good laugh about it. \n\nThen I found out, you can vote multiple times a week, multiple times for each contestant the remaining 8 weeks of the contest. So I decided to dedicate myself to ensuring she wouldn't get the prize and be the face of the 'non-judgmental girl of the year' and voted against her every single day, multiple times a day, for 8 weeks. \n\nShe was knocked out of the running halfway through the 8 weeks due to low numbers. \n\nMissy, if you see this, you will know it was me.

We're both studying at the university, so my parents pay the rent and give us a monthly allowance. \n\nLast week, my sister started smoking cigarettes in her bedroom, inside the house. Since it is winter, it's fairly cold outside and she kept her window closed. That means that the whole apartment smelt like smoke. Now, the smell of smoke is really annoying to me and therefore I'm not a smoker. \n\nI tried telling her that it's not fair to me that she smokes in the apartment. She replied with a bitchy attitude, saying \"Fuck off\". \n\nI decided to let it slip and not make it a big deal, because I thought that she wouldn't do it again. Next day comes, I get inside the apartment and there it is. The fucking smell of smoke. In the entire apartment. I asked her again not to smoke inside, because it's really annoying to me. She told me that she is only smoking in her bedroom and that it is her right to do so. \n\nSo, few days later, I come up with a revenge. \n\nThis week, she is having exams every day in her uni. That means that she needs a quiet environment in order to study and sleep. It was 11:00 PM.  I was sitting in the living room with my friend and decided to play some music on my phone. \n\n30 seconds later, she rushed through the door, demanding that I turn off the music immediately. I replied with the same \"Fuck off\" that she told me when I asked her not to smoke. Then, she started getting absolutely mad and she threatened to break my phone. I told her that if she said sorry about smoking inside and promised that she wouldn't do it again, I would turn off the music. \n\nObviously, she didn't. She went to her room and called my father and started crying and yelling on the phone. Minutes later, she wore her shoes and exited the apartment while murmuring something like \"You will see what I'll do to you\".  Then, she slammed the door behind her. \n\nI'm really sorry that I have to act in this way. I really don't like it. But in the end, why should I respect someone that doesn't give a fuck about me? What's your opinion, did I take it too far?",

        "text": "As he wedged his large, sweaty frame into the center seat next to my aisle seat, I knew it was going to be a long flight (Pittsburgh to San Francisco). Then he took off his shoes--I'm not going to say it was the worst stink, but it was hot foot juice none the less. I should have said something right away, but chose to sit there and brood.   \n\n\nSeveral hours into the flight, I noticed he was sleeping. Inspiration struck. I reached under his seat and was able to get one out (by the shoe string I should add). I then carried his solo shoe all the way to the back of the plane and put it in an overhead.   \n\n\nWhen we got the announcement we were starting our decent, stank toes began to wake. I could see him feeling around with his foot for his missing shoe. Then, he did that awkward 'half bend' trying to feel with his hands. Then he asked everyone around him to look. He was getting more and more panicked by the minute. I assured him it must have slid forward or backward and it would turn up.  \n\n\nAs I was exiting the plane, I had a brief conversation with the flight attendant: All I said was there is a guy seat 2C (or whatever) who is missing a shoe. After everyone is off, look in the overhead in the back left side of the plane. She realized what was happening and smiled.   \n\n\nI sat outside the plane waiting for him to exit. Dead last. Hope he learned a lesson.",

        "text": "Alt account. On Mobile. English is my native language, but I still make mistakes. \n\nI work as a Software Engineer. Recently started working on a new project within the org. It was already being worked on by a few folks, but primarily by one person. Let‚Äôs call them DD. DD apparently came in through a referral from someone in upper management and had no experience or knowledge on anything to do with the project. Was learning on the job, but lacked knowledge on even the basic stuff. One example of what they did - the project needs a framework X to run. DD claimed that they had tested everything on their machine and all good to test. But none of us could run it. Asked DD the version of X they were using to run it to identify the cause. Turns out, they didn‚Äôt actually install X. But still claimed that the code runs. Had enough of them and spent a couple of days fixing it ourselves. \n\nRecently I had been going through the code and noticed that the code had some issues. It was doing a requirement R, but not in a correct way which would lead to a lot of bad results from the code. Pointed this out in the dev group and mentioned that we have been giving people the impression that these components are done, when are having issues like this. \n\nThey then scheduled a call with me and in the call explained a very bad reasoning for why it is done the way it is done wrong. The equivalent to it would be - ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get power with the fuse connected. So I removed it and directly connected the wires. So everything works now‚Äù. Then they proceeded to lecture me saying that I shouldn‚Äôt point such stuff out since it is mean and that this change would be taken up as an enhancement. I tried to argue saying an enhancement would be an improvement on something that already works. But what we have does not work, at-least not in the way it is supposed to work. I also explained that I wasn‚Äôt being mean and that I was just pointing out the issues we have in our code. They kept repeating that I was mean and I shouldn‚Äôt be mentioning them in the group (it is just the devs who work on this in the group and they are the most senior one there) and that it will affect the team harmony. After a while, I had enough of them so just said okay and brought the call to an end. \n\n\nSince then, I have spotted several other issues. But I am not pointing it out as they asked and I have started looking for another job. \n\nNote: The changes we are working on aren‚Äôt live yet, but will be soon. Will share details about the fallout then.",

        "text": "A long time ago, I was living in a ground floor appartment with a separate entrance, in a 5 floors building. One night, I woke up around midnight because a neighbour from upstairs was watching TV very loudly. I was very tired and did not want to get up, get dressed (it was winter time), go in the street to the main entrance of the building and find the right appartment to make it stop. I tried ignoring it, fell asleep and woke up again, then I hit the ceiling with a broom several times and it stopped.\nThe same happened a few more times. It was quiet for a few weeks, and then my neighbour started to do it again, and it was even LOUDER, I could recognize what he was watching, the lame tv movies that are broadcasted on public TV at night. I tried the broom again, but it did not work anymore. The worst part was that I could almost fall asleep while the characters spoke, but then a commercial or strong background music would come and wake me up. So, at around 2am, I went to find the right door. It was easy, the volume was so high I could listen to the whole show from the lobby. I knocked, rang the Bell. No answer. Talked through the door. No answer. I waited for a while, tried again. No answer. And then I heard... snorring. The guy was sleeping !! Despite his tv being full volume,  and me banging his door. I was pretty pissed off at that point. Then I had a radical idea. As I used the common garbage bins, I had the key to the service/utility room. I opened the power panel, and tried switching off and on every breaker until I found the one that turned off his TV. I went to sleep in peace. \nAfter that night, there were a couple more times when it happened again. I went straight to the breaker, each time. I guess third time's a charm because I never heard his TV again after that.",

I offered more because we make similar salaries (she makes slightly more) and felt bad because the amount wasn‚Äôt that high.\n\nBut she got greedy and thought negotiations were ‚Äútaking too long‚Äù and that she could get more, so ghosted me and filed with child support (DCSS) with an old address for me. DCSS tried super hard to push through a very high CS amount based on 0% custody and 0% income for her. \n\nLuckily I had mail forwarding set up and put my phone number into the DCSS website.  DCSS called me and I was able to file an answer within the allotted time.  It then took 8 months to get a hearing, the entire time my ex could have been getting paid if she had settled.\n\nDuring this period she lost some custody due to things unrelated to child support so timeshare changed to 50/50.\n\nIn her filings and at the hearing she lied about the timeshare trying to use a very old order that was only in place for about 2 months to claim I only had 22% timeshare to get backpay (during backpay period I actually had the kids 45% of the time).\n\nThe outcome of all this was after almost a year, the judge ordered 0 backpay and 0 CS going forward.  I am so relieved.\n\nMy ex still refuses to pay any of the unreimbursed medical fees but whatever, I pay them, just as I provide school supplies, extracurricular payments, and purchase their clothes (so don‚Äôt worry about her not being able to provide for the kids, she just bought our older son some 200 dollar jordans and a 100 dollar lizard to replace the one she killed).",

It's like a squeak every 20 seconds. Usually we have to wait for Rory to chew through his toys' squeakers - hours, days. We don't really want to say anything because he's so good, but one Monday, my will to ignore it broke. I had awoken with pounding headache, and the caffeine was not alleviating the pain. Each new squeak felt like the smallest of needles passing through my brain right behind my eyes.  I'm not proud of this (yes I am), but my boy in IT has a cordless drill on hand that he let me borrow. I took Rory's pink penguin right from under his nose, faked a throw down the hall, and hid the stuffy in the back of my shirt. With Rory bewildered, I took the toy into my office and felt around the toy for the squeak valve. Once I found it, I took my pocket knife and made a small incision in the fuzzy layer, and with the borrowed IT drill, I carefully drilled a 1/8\" hole through the squeaker's valve, silencing the animal forever, before throwing it back to Rory.   \n\n\nNow I just do it automatically when Rory gets a new squeaky toy. People seem be genuinely grateful, and my boss assumes Rory chewed through his toy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: The squeaky toy version of an icicle murder",

        "text": "I used to go to a certain 24 hr gas station close to my house around 3 or 4am regularly b/c that's when I got off work and not much else was open.  It was usually the same guy working. He was always  friendly but not really creepy seeming. \n\nOne night I was just getting some honey and he said dont worry about paying. It was odd but I figured maybe he already counted his drawer or was mad at his boss. Whatever.  Then he said hold on I wanna show you something and started walking toward the back. I followed him. Not nervous but I prefer a good amount of personal space so I stayed about 4 to 5 feet behind him. \n\nHe opened the door to the back room and I could see from where I was that it was just a stock room and it was mostly empty so when stepped in the door way and motioned for me to follow I stopped and asked what he wanted to show me. \n\nDude lunged at me, grabbed my arm and tried to yank me into the room. Fortunately for me I am really strong, a lot stronger than I look, and I grabbed him back yanked him away from the room toward the cameras and kinda threw him into the wall.  I said \"Thanks for the honey  bitch\" and I left.  \n\nAt first I was mad, then I was depressed about it.  I thought about calling the cops but in the place I lived they didnt even show up for gunshots half the time. I thought about calling his boss but he had been there for years and  a lot of times these things dont get taken seriously. I didnt know what I was gonna do but the next day I went in with my phone, clearly video taping him and when he saw me he smiled! He liked that I had him on video and called me honey and flexed his muscles for the camera. WTF?!? He literally just thought what he did was cool until I started talking and I let him know in no uncertain terms that I was angry.  His response was A  nervous  \" Oh are you gonna get your boyfriend to come do something to me?\" \n\nThat made me even more mad. Like why wasnt he afraid of me. He already knows Im stronger than him. But he had such little regard for women that he thinks what he did was ok and the only thing to worry about is if I got a man involved. \n\nThe more I thought about the more I started to worry about other women to cross his path. Not all women are as strong as I am and somebody else may have wound up in that back room. I thought he needed to learn that a woman can be scary and not feel so comfortable just casually assaulting us.  I didnt wanna hit him and go to jail so I made a plan, and it was a fun one. \n\nI kept going in at random intervals. Sometimes multiple days in a row. Sometimes not for weeks. Sometimes after work, sometimes after a performance, dressed in any kind of mask or strange dirty sweaty clothes I had worn on stage.  Every time was a new demented scenario. \n\nThe first time I put a handful of coins in my mouth. ( yeah its gross but worth it) It was well over the amount that honey cost. I walked in staring at him with a blank look on my face and grabbed a honey , never breaking eye contact. He was not happy to see me this time.\n\n He was on the phone and I walked toward the counter but stayed about 10 ft away and just stared. He tried to wave me to the register and cash me out while he was on the phone. He really didnt wanna interact with me and my dead stare started to creep him out pretty quickly.  \n\nIt took about 5 minutes for him to get off the phone. He was weirded out by this time but he couldnt really call the cops or do anything because I had him on video admitting to assaulting me. I held my ground and my stare. It was so hard not to smile as he got more and more nervous but I held on for about 10 solid minutes then slowly walked up to the  counter and opened my mouth, just let all the coins just fall out.  I stared blankly for another few seconds and walked out with my honey. \n\nEvery time was something equally crazy. Once I just kept opening candy at the counter taking one bite  then dropping it and saying\" It doesnt taste good. Why doesnt it taste good? I need it to taste good!!\" Then I left a 20 in the counter and walked out. Im not a thief. One time i just cheerfully  sang a cramps song and rearranged an entire aisle. Every time he tried to tell me to stop I death glared him and sang louder. \n \nI visited him often for around 6 months. Sometimes I would act like he was my best friend and just hang out at the counter telling him random nonsensical stories. Sometimes I would act like I was so heartbroken and sad about like the donut display or something. But I NEVER EVER let him speak. I would change my expression to a murder stare and keep talking but make my voice very loud and firm until he shut up. \n\nEventually he developed a twitch and I could tell he was truly miserable so I felt done.  My boyfriend really wanted to see this dude so I brought him in for one last visit. Did a whole introduction like we were buddies. We both leaned on the counter drinking soda and eating candy for about 30 minutes. It was earlier than usual do  a few other people were in and out. We were cheerful as fuck. \n\nI told him that I felt like he didnt like me as much as he used to. I told my boyfriend in front of him \" He used to like me A LOT!  He liked me so much he tried to drag me into that back room over there. You gotta really like someone to do that\" I asked him why he didnt like me as much as he used to. Told him I felt like I have been a really good friend. I even come to see him all the time. I even eat candy that doesnt taste good and help arrange shelves and sing him songs. I acted so hurt. So my boyfriend acted really offended and asked him why he doesnt like me as much.  He knew better than to speak by now so it was a real deer in the headlights scenario. \n\nAs we were leaving I said \" Oh, I have a present for you but I forgot it!!  It's ok, I'll just bring it to your house. Don't worry I wasn't following you or anything..I was just driving behind you and watching where you go! Bye!!\" Then I never went back.  \n\nI dont have any way of knowing if it worked but my hope is that next time this POS wants to put his hands on a woman that doesnt want it, he remembers the 6 months of hell the last one gave him.",

It was in a parking lot inside the mall and it's a Sunday and PACKED. I signaled very early right when I saw the family walking to their car. I was waiting patiently and then see that another car saw their spot as well and signals too a lot later than I did. I had already waited a few minutes already. I even waved my arm out at them to let them know I had been waiting for the spot already. They don't care. They then manage to steal the spot and I get really pissed and honk at them. \n\nThe next time something like this happens to me, I'm planning to put a sticky note on their windshield that says \"I hit your car\" (not actually damage it though) AND super glue/put wood glue on the back of it. I know some people will say to just get over it but nah, I can't let this happen to other people. People who steal other people's spots need to learn their lesson.",

Sharing birthdays suck - and especially if it‚Äôs with a woman who doesn‚Äôt respect you as an adult and boundaries.  \n\nIt was 2019 and MIL found out that she had another grandchild.  BIL found out through a paternity test that the girl he denied was his was actually his.  MIL backed her son up and once the paternity test was positive - Ohhhh! I have another granddaughter.  Lets all celebrate my birthday at Disney!  \n\nThe plan was renting a hotel room and all the grandkids visit which was our daughter, my niece, BIL and his new GF and her daughter and my husband and myself.  We had to pay for our daughter and us.  \n\nI didn‚Äôt think it was right we would have to pay for us when our daughter‚Äôs birthday was basically the same weekend and I‚Äôve been to Disney with her.  She sucks all the fun out with her complaining.  \n\nOur daughter REALLY wanted a party.  She was turning 9.  And she has lots of friends.  I didn‚Äôt want to do a party because of the planning.  But because MIL was pushing us to go to Disney to celebrate her birthday, I told daughter - hey! How would you like that party?\n\nI planned it right when MIL planned her getaway.  And when MIL pushed I said so sorry, we have our daughter‚Äôs birthday party then.  \n\nI printed about 20 invites from Walgreens for the party to be held at the local park.  I let my daughter hand them out at the School Trunk or Treat.  She invited about 17 kids.  I then let daughter pick the menu and decorations and daughter had her party while MIL had hers. \n\nMy daughter had the best time and I didn‚Äôt have to deal with the drama of MIL and even BIL.  And the cost was probably cheaper than all of us going to Disney.",

It still runs, but my kids‚Äô door is collapsed in and we haven‚Äôt been able to afford to get it fixed just yet. It looks pretty bad, but looks worse than it is. \n2) People who leave shopping carts in parking spaces are a personal pet peeve of mine. \n\nSo I‚Äôm sick, cold, not C0vid, and I go to my local Walgreens for some heavy DayQuil and Tylenol for my kids. I walk out and this woman my mom‚Äôs age (I‚Äôm 39) takes her shopping cart and very deliberately parks it in the painted over section between the only two handicapped spaces in the lot. Like, the part that‚Äôs supposed to be left clear so people can get out. It‚Äôs literally 15 steps to the door of the Walgreens. I reflexively call out,\n‚ÄúIn the HANDICAPPED space?? Really???‚Äù\nShe goes, ‚ÄúYeah, I know‚Ä¶‚Äù and usually at this point (because I am one to always tell people, ‚Äúthe door is right there‚Äù) people get embarrassed and walk their cart to the door. Not this woman. \n\nShe launches into a whole soliloquy about how she thought about the placement because it‚Äôs close to the door so the person inside can grab it easily, and she put it there, on the ‚Äúpassenger‚Äù side so people can still pull in and they probably won‚Äôt have anyone with them anyway (wtf??? People with placards are loners now?) and anyway she gets it because her husband has has several bypasses so she understands how there things work. Btw all this took her at least twice as long to say as it would have taken for her to walk the darn cart to the door. \nMe: ‚ÄúWell. Glad you‚Äôve got that all justified for yourself.‚Äù\nHer: (walking to her car) ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to be justified, I‚Äôm in love!‚Äù (No idea what this woman is talking about.)\nMe: (Getting into my car, which happens to be parked across the aisle from her) No, I meant your rudeness.‚Äù\nHer: Literally laughs as she climbs in her car. \n\nSo I back up and angle my car like I‚Äôm pulling out of the parking lot, but instead stop right in front of her hood. The banged in side of my car is in full view. Go ahead lady. Does it look like I care if my car gets hit? She goes nuts inside her car, yelling and leaning on the horn, I just turn off my engine and visibly pull out a book. The cart got put back.",

Under the GM that hired me it was actually a pretty cool gig, then the company was sold and each GM after that got worse. \n\nI no longer needed the job an had turned in my notice. A snow storm hit Saturday night into Sunday. I was scheduled as the projectionist for the day shift. I also rented where I had to shovel out my car PLUS the entire driveway. \n\nI got the call that we had a delayed opening when I‚Äôd taken a break from shoveling. I was pissed off that I had to go in for 4 hours. ( I realize now I could‚Äôve told them to F off and gone back to bed.) \n\nA couple hours into my shift (I‚Äôd started the matinee movies only) the evening projectionist called bc his street hadn‚Äôt even been plowed. \n\nThe lengths they went to to try to get me to stay were impressive, and if I hadn‚Äôt already turned in my notice I might‚Äôve taken the money. The last offer they made was double time for a double shift (including the initial 2 hours that we were closed due to the storm) if I‚Äôd just start the 7 pm showing. And I just said the same thing I‚Äôd said the whole time they thought they were negotiating with me: that my shift was over at 6pm and I was unavailable after that. \n\nWe all got sent home early.

        "text": "This was many years ago when I was in college. We had mostly amazing people on our dorm (1st floor) except for Charles (who was very rich). He flaunted his wealth by pointing out his watch, computer and other items by saying how expensive they are and hope no one would steal them. \n\nAll the rooms in our dorm had vinyl flooring. This was not acceptable to him so he had his dad have some carpet guys come over during thanksgiving break and put wall to wall carpet down. \n\nIn December, the floor get cold and your would not want to walk on it barefoot so we all had slippers/flip flops we used to walk around the dorm. He would keep pointing out how nice it was to walk barefoot in his room and he wish he could get the hall way carpeted for the hallways. \n\nCue the petty revenge. When Christmas break arrived, we ask our floor preceptor to leave Charles room unlocked before leaving for Christmas break. The preceptor also hated this kid since we would complain about all kinds of things. All she said was not to steal anything or do anything that would have campus police investigate. \n\nSince a couple of my high school friends lived near by the college, we snuck into the dorm (no one was there on New Year's day). We bought about a huge case of small coated dixie cups, a stapler, huge box of staples and two water jugs. We started in the corner farthest away from door and would lay down dixie cups and staples them together. Then we would fill with water and work our way out to the door and leave enough room for the door to open.\n\nWe got back to the dorm early once school started and told everyone that someone was playing a joke on Charles and then we all waited in the common area till Charles came in and opened his door. The look on his face was worth all the trouble and money we spent on this. There was no way for him to remove the water since if he tried to pick up a cup it would pull the others cups and water would ruin his precious carpet. \n\nCharles was fuming and yelling and said he was going to go to the dean. We pointed out that would not be a good idea since the carpet was illegal and he would get in trouble for modifying the room, which strictly forbidden. When he realized that he was screwed, he had to walk over the cups to make a call to his dad since none of us would allow him to use our phone (only landline in those days). I am sure the clean up crew got paid a lot of money to clean up and restore the room. We became famous on campus after this and Charles left the school at the end of the semester. \n\nRevenge is best served in a dixie cup full of water.",

        "text": "This happened a few years ago when I was in college. In my college dorms we have apartments, and each dorm building is three stories tall. I was on the second floor, in the apartment closest to the stairs (this is important to remember). On the third floor above me was my best friend, and the apartment below me were strangers I didn't know.   \n\n\nOn the first day moving in, my roommate let me know that the dorm below had been blasting music loudly. I decided I would exchange numbers with them, with the idea that if I was unnecessarily loud they could let me know (the previous year I was on the first floor with very sexually active neighbors above me and it was awkward talking to them).   \n\n\nThis is where the issue would arise. They played music extremely loud. All the time. To the point it vibrated my apartment. Now you never hear anything from next door neighbors, so I'm not surprised their neighbors didn't notice anything, but oh boy I sure did. I would try to text them about them, but it would either get ignored or they'd get mad and tell me to just leave my apartment (which this was during the pandemic so expecting your neighbor to leave the dorm in the midst of Covid so you could blast music was mind boggling to me). At the same time they would claim that me and my roommate would stomp all the time(going so far as to slam a broom against their ceiling while we were sitting down for dinner). Which was also mind boggling because most the time I was either in classes, or passed out, or at my desk. My roommate was a very quiet person as well.  \n\n\nTheir noisiness got so bad that at one point, at 3 AM it woke me up. I had spoken to an RA at some point, but finally one came out this night and just sat with me in the dorm. The RA shock at how loud they were being. I showed them the texts we exchanged and they explained to me that no matter if it was quiet hours or not the dorms had curtesy rules. If you are too loud, you are too loud and you need to keep it down. You are expected to not cause a ruckus. In this case it was worse because you can get in trouble if you're unnecessarily loud during quiet hours, which we obviously were in. Furthermore, they explained, telling someone to leave the dorm because they complained you were loud was not okay.  \n\n\nIt took 2 hours before they finally stopped blasting music, and in the morning they sent an angry text to me about calling an RA on them for.... playing music at 10 am? Whatever, but they stopped playing music after that, but still would send confusing and snippy texts about me and my roommate stomping.  \n\n\nIn about a week I finally realized what they were talking about. They sent another text, except both me and my roommate were not in the dorm at the time. I realized that what they thought was us stomping, were in fact people stomping up and down the building's stairs. If you walked down them, you couldn't be heard, but if you ran or stomped down them you were extremely loud. I explained this to them, and from that point forward I never received a text from them again.  \n\n\nAnd it may have been small revenge, but I got great exercise and joy from stomping down those damn stairs every fucking day for the rest of the year. As loud as I could I would slam my feet on the shitty linoleum, and in the crusty hallway near their room. And I never heard a peep out of them because they assumed it was just some asshole on the stairs. They were right.  \n\n\n TLDR: Downstairs neighbor got in trouble for being loud, thought I was stomping above them, it was actually people in the stairwell, so I started stomping in the stairwell.",

        "text": "Managed to find an awesome house to rent after college with two other friends. One was my good buddy from undergrad, let‚Äôs call him Ben. The other was someone who I‚Äôd gotten to know through another close friend, and let‚Äôs call her Crystal. Everything is all fine, and actually great for quite some time. Lived our own lives, but had a great time hanging out together too. The perfect roommate situation.\n\nThat is, until Crystal started dating Pablo.  Pablo was the ultimate deadbeat with a Napoleon complex. Just a little over a month into our lease, Pablo got evicted from his placed, and Crystal asked if he could stay for a short period while he looked for a new place. Being understanding and empathetic, and trusting Crystal (we had no reason not to), we said sure as long as it‚Äôs temporary. Big mistake.\n\nPablo lost his job. Pablo had been dishonorably discharged from the military. Pablo was a(n) (unsuccessful) gambler. Pablo was a drunk (it was New Orleans, so it‚Äôs not like any of us had a leg to stand on here), but he was a dangerous drunk. He would verbally abuse Crystal, waking up the whole household in the middle of the night with fights. He killed her pet fish by running it under scalding hot water. He would hurl racial slurs at my then-boyfriend. He broke Ben‚Äôs Wii. On numerous occasions, he left the front door wide open (anyone who knows New Orleans knows this is a bad move, even in the safest areas). He left an empty pot on the stove with the burner on, and I came home to a house full of smoke. He was really putting everyone‚Äôs lives in danger.\n\nBen and I decided to have a house meeting to discuss our concerns with her, and, knowing that sometimes emotions can flair, we came with a written agenda so as to just stick to the facts. Yet Crystal defended him, and offered no solution to when he would be leaving and finding his own place (spoiler: he never would).\n\n[Really rubbing salt in the wound, Pablo had gambled much of their money and Crystal was having trouble making rent one month. She asked if she could borrow it and pay me back next paycheck. Again, being a trusting empath, and feeling like we had no other choice, I did. I was furious to find out that the two of them had left for a long weekend at a casino resort in Mississippi before having paid me back.]\n\nWell, now for the petty revenge:\n\nI had been working two full-time jobs. I saved like crazy, and it was 2008 and housing prices had dipped. I decided to buy my own home. Ben knew all about this (so did my landlady), and was planning to be my roommate in the new house, but I never mentioned a single word to Crystal. I found a great place, made an offer, and closed a little thereafter.\n\nIt just so happened that the day I closed on the house, when we were already planning to move and just get the hell out of dodge, Crystal and Pablo took one of their famous casino getaways. We got around 15-20 of our close friends, one of whom had an enormous truck and a giant flatbed (of course someone did, it was Louisiana). Many hands make light work, and within a few short hours the entire house other than their room was cleared out. (Ohhhh, did I mention?: All the furniture, all the kitchen stuff, everything in the common rooms belonged to either me or Ben).\n\nCrystal and Pablo returned home at the end of a full day of gambling, only to find a completely empty house except for their room. We told them we had switched the utilities (that were under my name) to the new house, and we had informed the landlady, and paid out our share of the remainder of the lease. The looks on their faces was priceless. We left and never saw them again, halleloo.\n\nTL;DR - Roommate‚Äôs psycho boyfriend moved in, never left, went bananas. Other roommate and I got a huge group of friends to help move all our stuff to a new house without telling them, in just a few hours time while they were away. They returned to a completely empty house except for their stuff. Priceless looks on their faces as we left for the last time.",

        "text": "Years ago I was going through a nasty divorce. I was living alone in an apartment with my son and my parents lived about a half hour away.  My mother is a Narcissist (I discovered this years later), and any time she does something \"nice\" there's always strings attached and stipulations.\n\nI needed a car. I never asked for one. I was walking and biking to work bc I didn't have the money for proper transportation at the time.  My parents showed up to my apartment one day out of the blue with a car and a contract. The deal was that it would remain in my mom's name until the divorce was finalized and that I would pay them back with my tax refund. I cried as I signed, feeling like I was making a deal with the Devil, but I need a car, so looking back on it I signed under protest, invalidating the contract's legality.  According to them, the contract was to protect us both. The purpose of keeping it in my mom's name was so that my ex couldn't claim it as a martial asset, so it was \"mom's\" car in name only.\n\nThe thing was a money pit. I put more money in it than it was worth trying to keep it running.\n\nTowards the end of my divorce a visitation schedule was set and we had to meet at a certain location, which was too far for me to walk. \n\nMy mom and I got into an argument and then she said \"Well why don't I just take the car back?  You're not using MY car for your EX'S visitation!  He can come pick up your son from your apartment!\"  Oh really?...  You're gonna go there?... \n\nBTW, my ex is the kind of person that would just be fine with not seeing our son for his scheduled visitation, so I would be responsible for paying for more childcare expenses and having to find help. Also, my mother didn't really want the car and she didn't have to deal with the BS of my ex.\n\nI said, \"Fine. Take it back. We'll walk. A court doesn't care how I get my son to see his dad. So if you want your 4-y-o grandson to walk on a busy road, so be it bc that's our only option. You know (Ex) doesn't give a shit and will just find a way to use it against me in court. But go ahead. Take the car back. It's a lemon anyway and I can't afford the upkeep. I'll be glad to get rid of that burden.\"\n\nShe didn't take the car back and never threatened to take it back again.\n\nMy circumstances are better. My car was totaled in an accident (not my fault) and I was able to get a newer car on my own merit and credit.",

        "text": "About 18 years ago, I worked in an outpatient medical clinic at the front desk. There was a lot of turnover with that job, primarily due to the OTHER front-desk person and her two pals (the nurse and the medical assistant). I caught wind of the fact that they had bullied my two predecessors into quitting before 6 months had passed, and was told to be on my guard. It was solid advice.\n\nThe three of them, especially my colleague at the front desk, started in on me, too. I was accused of other people's errors, I was blamed for things not being done that were someone else's responsibility, and they were just plain nasty human beings. I even would come in every morning to find that my adjustable-height desk chair was pushed all the way down to the lowest possible height, so I would have to adjust it to my own height every freaking morning. There's more, but I will spare you the details. Just presume daily low-key and high-key harassment.\n\nThe way this clinic was set up, we were both checking patients in and out, AND we were answering phones and forwarding them as needed. There was also one cordless phone located behind the desk, specifically for patients to use if they needed to call a cab or make some other call. Mobile phones were just starting to really take off in the early 2000s, and not everyone had one yet, especially not the older patients.  We couldn't have patients using the front desk phones to make calls, because we had to keep those lines clear for incoming calls from patients and doctors; hence, the solution was this cordless phone. \n\nWe were instructed to never answer incoming calls to that phone, as it was not one of our official phone lines. The problem was that some recipients of patients' calls would then try to call that number when they wanted to reach the patient, as that was what they had on their caller ID. So while the phone didn't ring daily, there were some days when that cordless phone would ring off the hook, due to some really, really persistent person who kept trying, and we couldn't answer it no matter how long they let it ring.\n\nAfter a few months, I had had enough. No one before my arrival had ever successfully figured out how to turn the ringer off that phone. But I picked the thing up and dug, dug, and dug some more through the menus. Finally, about three or four menu levels deep into the settings, I found the volume setting and turned it to zero. (Again: early 2000s tech, which was far less user-friendly than what we have now.) PEACE and QUIET at last!\n\nWell, the bullying continued. Unlike my two predecessors, I actually lasted a year in that job. But even I can only tolerate so much torment. The stress was starting to cause medical issues, so I knew I had to go.\n\nShortly before my last day on that job, late in the afternoon when I was the last one left in the office, I dug through the multiple menu levels on that phone again and turned the ringer volume up to the maximum. \n\nUnfortunately, I forgot to call myself with that phone to get the number on my caller ID, so I was not able to call it and let it ring ad infinitum myself, lol. But know from experience that there were people who would call repeatedly and let it ring for a year, rather than hang up after a reasonable amount of time. And I am equally sure that no one else figured out how to turn the ringer back off, because if they had been able to do that, it would already have been turned off long before I got the job.\n\nSo for the next few years, at least until the building closed and they moved to their new location, I hope that phone rang off the hook for them on a regular basis. Petty? Sure. But nowhere near what they deserved for being bullying AHs. Bullies can go kick rocks.",

One particular receptionist had requested to be the person doing the ordering for this guy and we all let her.\n\nHer petty revenge?

He got barred from my sister's place of work for turning up drunk, banging on the windows, and trying to fight the owner.\n\nBut worst of all, he's very obviously been drunk and on other substances - we think mostly \\* coca cola \\* - around my nephew.\n\nI could write essays and novels about why this guy is a waste of oxygen, but please just trust me - if you're a relatively sane individual, you wouldn't like him. Have we tried to get my sister to dump him? Of course! But she is, of course, \"in love\".\n\nSo my petty revenge, as small as it is, is based on these 3 things - he has a very short temper, sleeps very badly and is therefore usually up all night, and has and a very bad credit history. Which means he has a crappy mobile phone data plan and therefore, relies on wi-fi.\n\nI control the wi-fi in my house.\n\nI have been blocking and unblocking him from our wi-fi every time he stays over for weeks now. I know he's awake and using the wi-fi because of an app I use.\n\nVery occasionally I'll block him all night long, but most of the time I'll do it on &amp; off. If I wake up to pee at 2am? I'll block him, and then unblock him when I get back to my room. If I can't sleep I'll block him, unblock him, wait until he logs back on, wait 60 seconds and then block him again. I have done this repeatedly for probably 30 minutes straight at times. I've even set alarms for 4 or 5am to block him and go back to sleep, because I know he wakes up early. I have heard him cursing from my sister's bedroom. I've heard him crashing about in the living room at half three in the morning, turning the router on and off.\n\nI don't know. This story is probably not very thrilling for most people. But god DAMN does it feel good when I hit that block button. It's like a little gland in my brain releases a happy buzz.",
