Subscriptions are $10/month and pay for ambassadors to perform cleanups. Spotless handles hiring, logistics, and quality assurance.\n\nSpotless is looking for beta testers/early adopters to sign up and contribute to a fund for zip codes of interested detrashed redditors so that location reporters can begin reporting locations which can be done within the app.\n\nYou can check out the app at http://spotless.earth.\n\nSign up, begin reporting locations, and let's start cleaning!",
