But I am far from actually being good at the language. \n\nIt would be much appreciated if anyone in this subreddit can recommend some MOOCs or even paid courses on platforms like udemy that provide a very comprehensive coverage of the content/knowledge required c++ (many courses have similar descriptions but the content has some difference). Money is not a problem unless its really really costly.\n\nI know there are alot of courses teaching c++ out there, but since my country forces me to conscript into the military for the next 2 years, I want to make the most out of my time until then, so I really cannot afford too much time trialing each course.\n\nHence, if anyone has had the experience of learning from an online course that really stands out/really effective (e.g. good teaching) and comprehensive, please do recommend it to me. Thank you!\n\nIf it helps, I am mostly looking to work towards game development and maybe databases(?). \n\nBooks are also welcome, but I would honestly rather online courses. :)",

Based on my skills, they extended my internship and offered a permanent role to manage the entire tech infrastructure of the organisation which consists of running like 10+ portals, being the point of contact for them with the tech partners who develop solutions for them (Org does not know tech, only my boss does which is into management since 10+ years).\n\nOn the other hand, I have an \"Associate Software Developer\" offer from campus at a Product based Fintech. The pay is lower ofcourse but I'm looking to get the SDE experience which I don't think I'll get at the NGO.\n\nI've personally done some previous internships, made some decent projects in freelancing. I do mostly backend and DevOps.\n\nJust need some advice on whether should I get the tech experience first or do this consulting gig side by side and learn individually.",

I like math problem solving, and thought there might be a way to leverage that as I go into my career to make up for that weakness.  I also feel I need to make more money than I do now... families are expensive.\n\nI have a master's degree in mathematics from a while back, but I'm pretty rusty on the advanced stuff.  I feel most of my strength is having a strong intuition of the classes I teach, which are statistics, algebra, and calculus at the high level, including math competition type reasoning/problem solving.\n\nOne pathway to making use of my math ability looked like passing two or three actuary exams and they seem to match with my math skill set very well.  Looking at the test, and I think I could guarantee pass them with around 100-200 hours of study time each.  But I'd like to hear about other options.\n\nI've also considered finding a data science bootcamp, since it seems like that's where my math skill set may fit best?  \n\nI'd really like to find an area of programming that utilizes the sort of reasoning I'm good at.  Honestly, some of the best times in I've had is a good math competition practice, problem solving with my upper level students.  I'd like that sort of thing to be the main part of a programming or data science job.",

Second was that my economics professors were unanimous in their advice that learning SQL and Python were a waste of time for a prospective financial analyst and that I just needed to get certified in Excel, which was true in 2004 when any of them were last looking for a job, but an absurd statement by the end of the 2010s.\n\nAt some point toward the end of 2021, I realized that I’d be better off just learning to code and doing software engineering than trying to re-enter my financial analytics job hunt after being three years out from school with no job in the field.

Editing video, filming, photoshooting are something you learn when you start then you are free to go. New company? New job? you can already start working. And because he works in the football field, he works for a season and then he is free to change job for the new season.\n\nBut how is our world? I have a colleague that has the same mentality before entering the job world, but after 1 year he knows he is unable to do that. Right now he works for a company that operate in the cloud. So telecommunications? he has to learn for months and in a year he started to really work only recently. how can he change job now right? But maybe, when he will be an expert in the cloud world, maybe he can job hopping in the same field other wise he will ended up in another field and learn a new thing over and over again.\n\nAlso, in the video editing world, depending on what you are producing, maybe many shorts content for socials, or maybe longer interview to football players, you can produce a lot.\n\nbut in our world, we know that to make something it takes a lot of effort. Maybe you can spend a year trying to produce something and not even close yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, for whom job hopping a lot, what is the usual lenght of time where you stay in a company? a year? 2? then change it?",

My employer is one of the older tech software company which is currently going through a lot integration and general consolidation.  \n\nWhile i was expecting to write APIs from scratch,   I have ended up in a team which is responsible for moving a large chunk of our Micro-services from one provider to another. \n\nCurrently i am tasked with supporting this migration by providing some kind of test data etc.. This generally involves one time delving into a bunch of services and tools, configuring them for the new env without much coding. This is all in a new technology i have never worked before. \n\nI am learning on the way, but i am afraid my performance is not up to the mark and i am asking people for help too much. In my last 2 tasks, i have ended up spending 70% of my time dealing with env/set up issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo simplify, Here are the Pros vs Cons\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- I have the title i was aiming for in my transition.\n\n\\- Better pay. \n\n\\- WFH\n\n\\- My team members who are generally helpful and sympathetic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- Significantly less coding\n\n\\- Lack of the cool start up culture i have grown fond of. No employee engagement as such. \n\n\\- Less transferable skills learning on the job.\n\n\\- General frustration with env issues and nature of the job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the cons above, i have been working on a side project to keep coding up and general well being.  My plans is to stay here for a year or so and see if i get to work on actual features. My boss's boss has mentioned we would be working on the migration stuff for a quarter or two.",

In 2020 I had a one month web dev project contract work. I completed it without trouble and on good terms, but that was it. I was going to move for a job, but the pandemic didn't do me any favors.\n\nLast year I did the 100 days of code challenge, I made a portfolio, applied to about 100 positions but didn't land anything. After about 50 applications I stopped even getting interviews.\n\nI focused on React, Vue, Node, Next.js, made a portfolio .\n\nThe local market, Knoxville, is a \"Microsoft Town\" as described by several people, they use C# and asp .net with demand for mid and senior developers. This year the tech conference Codestock is even cancelled. So there isn't even much opportunity to network. There are government jobs in Oak Ridge, but realistically they are for recent grads with high GPAs. It's been a few years for me.\n\nSo I'm kind of here without local connections, I hear about the big company layoffs such as Amazon, Meta, etc.. I don't know why anyone should hire me with those guys to compete with. It's not that I could never do what they are doing, it's that they have image I don't to hiring managers. I could develop niche stuff with time, but I don't have connections.\n\nI might go to a site like weworkremotely, but it might have 300 applications for a dev job or more, then mine.. I don't think they would pick me.\n\nI'm still working on gamedev projects on the side, and I think I can get them profitable, I've been going at it so long. I interviewed with a CEO of a startup I think I could do everything he is doing. But I hate taking risk when it can all crash and burn.. I'm trying to just leave this to weekends / evenings.\n\nI want to use my skills to get a webdev job. I could work remote, and I could move, sure. But remote work is saturated. I don't have savings to move. I mean, I guess I could save to move, go work any job 3-4 months. But even still, how would I even find someone interested?\n\nOn a day to day bases the past few weeks I find myself drifting more. I kind of don't want to apply because I feel like I'm screwed competing with all the layoffs. I go to the dev meetups, and it's gotten to the point it's not even helpful, anyone tried to be helpful I don't have experience mid-level and such, or know me as the gamedev guy, and again, the local conference is even cancelled.\n\nI'm not lazy, I even feel impulsive about it, I want to do something. But what?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr How do I land an entry level role? I've been too eccentric, what's the day to day process like? What should I do, or how?",

        "text": " \n\nHi all,\n\nLike the title says, I've got a degree in Information systems and have 1yr experience in what can best be described as level 2/3 help desk support. I was actually unemployed for 2 years but managed to land another job, which is the latter 6 months of the 1yr experience i mentioned, which i'm presently employed at. I currently make $26/hr in a semi-MCOL city.\n\nMy CS experience consists purely of building web apps at home with various web technologies like AWS, all sorts of different API's, python, javascript, etc. I actually have a decent portfolio of cool stuff I've built in the past 3 years. My IS degree did have plenty of intro programming classes, but was never the focus of the degree.\n\nI want to get a job in development. I think my non-traditional background with my degree and employment gap is making it more difficult to get my foot in the door. When I was applying for jobs a year ago, I actually landed a decent amount of SWE interviews and got pretty far in some of them, but never received offers. So i took this IS position because I needed a job.\n\nPerhaps it'd be smart to get a better foundation. With my background, do you think it'd be best to get a post-bacc in CS, or a masters in CS? Or just keep applying for jobs and use that experience to level up? Or both?\n\nWould appreciate any advice. I'm currently applying for CS jobs again btw. Thanks :)",

        "text": "I'm an Electrical Engineer with a Master's degree (not from the US) and a few years of experience in IT, managing infrastructure and coding tools to automate tasks. I also participated in coding competitions such as the ACM ICPC because I enjoy coding and solving problems. My experience is mainly outside of the US, but I have a good understanding of the front-end, back-end, networking, infrastructure levels, and cloud platforms like AWS.\n\nAfter losing my heavily underpaid and toxic job as a full-stack software engineer a few months ago, I started applying for new opportunities, but I've had no luck so far. Despite having experience in coding and related technologies, I only had one interview for a role that didn't align with my interests. I suspect that HR and ATS systems are acting as gatekeepers, preventing me from getting an interview. I had two referrals, one from a Fortune 100 company and another from a small company, but unfortunately, I didn't receive any communication back from them, just automated emails rejecting my applications.\n\nI spent around 10 hours tweaking my resume and cover letter for each role I applied to, but still, no luck. It's frustrating to hear that my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering is a barrier to entry for some companies, despite having relevant experience and skills. I'm curious if anyone else in this community has had a similar experience, particularly those with a non-CS background.\n\nThank you for your time and any insights you can provide.",

        "text": "I am a CS student trying to get an internship, and I’m not having much success. I’ve applied to about 50 places and I’ve not gotten any response whatsoever; I either get ignored, or sometimes get sent an automated email that says “we’ve moved forward with other candidates.”\n\nI have had my resume reviewed by a career coach and the career center at my university, and both thought that my resume wasn’t super problematic. Instead, they both thought that I needed to spend a lot more time networking and reaching out to people on LinkedIn. The person at the career center thought I needed to start rearranging components of my resume and changing experience and project descriptions to match the job requirements that specific companies had posted for their positions. They also thought I should start reaching out to developers at companies that interest me, build up a rapport with them over time, and then eventually job opportunities would materialize through this networking (friend of a friend has a job opening, things like that).\n\nI totally understand how this would be a good strategy for specific companies, and I will admit that I am not very comfortable with reaching out to people on LinkedIn and it’s something I’ve underutilized and should do more (I can’t shake the feeling that I’m soliciting these people and begging for a job, and it makes me feel bad). That being said, I’m really shocked at how much effort it takes to get an application noticed *anywhere* (not just the Googles and Amazons of the world, but any dev job), and I’m finding it difficult to determine how to best spend my time.\n\nWhat I mean is that at the end of the day, I could put a huge amount of time into one company: I could reach out to a recruiter on LinkedIn and a developer on the job, and spend time keeping that connection alive. I could also attend this company’s Intern Info Session #1, Intern Info Session #2, Coffee with Recruiters Session, etc. I could completely overhaul my resume and change all my wording to match their job description and beat the ATS. I could be given an automated coding test right when I apply that takes me 2 hours to complete. And they could still look at my resume and deny me fairly quickly, before I even get an interview.\n\nSo I get that giving a lot of attention to one specific employer can increase my odds with that specific employer, but man, at the end of the day I do need a developer job of some sort, so I’m trying to balance quantity and quality. Right now it feels like I’m doing too much quantity, but I’m also afraid to pump too much time into networking with one company or working on one application if it's not going to somewhat significantly increase my chances of having that application noticed.\n\nI apologize if I sound like I don’t want to put in the effort. I *do*, I just want to make sure I’m not missing something fundamental here and that I’m spending my time wisely. Is my resume maybe not as good as I think it is? Are ATS systems eliminating me from all of these jobs before a human even sees them? Is networking on LinkedIn really the missing piece that puts it all together? Worth noting also, I am a sophomore, so I get that I’m not as desirable as a junior; it could also be that 50 is not really that many applications, maybe it truly is just a numbers game. But I also don’t want to chalk it all up to that and then throw out 500 applications that are not useful.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any advice anyone has, and thank you for reading 😊\n\nTL;DR – I am not having success with internship applications, but am worried that I could spend too much time and energy on specific companies and networking that won’t be fruitful.",

I think it’s annoying and unnecessary and isn’t useful to your actual work.

I’ve never felt a stronger bond with someone simply because I saw their face on video. Second, you really don’t need that deep of a connection with a person to have a typical work conversation with them.\n\n&gt; they allow for nonverbal communication\n\nI don’t really buy this because I don’t think any real nonverbal communication happens in the first place. Personally, when I’m on camera I’m deliberately giving off a ‘I am here and paying attention’ appearance, or giving whatever cues I think my boss wants to see. I’m not giving any genuine reactions to anything and I’m guessing most people are the same. Unless you’re some executive who deeply cares about what’s going on, but most of us are not that.\n\n&gt; they allow presenters to see if their audience is engaged or bored\n\nIf it’s a work meeting, I’m probably bored, nothing personal.\n\n&gt; they allow you to see if people are slacking off\n\nProbably the most legit reason, but this should be easy to tell without a camera\n\nCurious what others think.

I felt like I didn't belong, didn't like programming enough, was a fraud, and had the general new-grad scaries amplified by those factors. I worked in industry for about a year at a very small company before switching into softer tech positions (tech writing, cx, etc) at the big tech companies. I spent my 20s exploring every tiny nook and cranny I could find - product marketing, design, learning experience, and even a brief foray into biology (I returned to school and am about to finish up a master's degree). I could have made careers out of any of these jobs, and considered it heavily, but over time I've come to the conclusion that I actually do love programming and miss the specific problem solving of it quite intensely. won't lie-- I also miss the luxury of having a life outside of work. I'll note that I don't regret the exploration I did at all-- I learned a lot about myself and I feel 1000x more resolute in what I actually want to do for my career than I have before. I also feel much more confident in myself and my ability to pivot and learn quickly and produce high quality work. I'm just overall a different person.\n\nI feel like I'm in a weird position now, however-- I'm currently finishing up school in something completely unrelated, and I've got very minimal professional experience with software development despite being several years out of school. My question is, what strategy do you think I should be applying here? Do I shoot for entry-level new graduate positions? Junior/associate roles? And in your experience, what would be the most efficient way to spend my time as I kind of build my case -- projects for my portfolio, skills, etc? I know quite a few positions want experience with agile/scrum, and while I get the concept, it's not something I've used in a professional setting. I've been out long enough that I don't know what to add to get competitive.\n\nI now understand that I can be an asset to my team, and it's something I'd like to do-- but do you have any tips on how I can convince others of that? \n\nTIA!",

I am looking for advice on next steps over the next 3-5 years, so that I can move into a career in the executive/corporate level of companies as a VP and then in hopefully the next decade a CTO.  Obviously it’s a long journey ahead but I want to give myself all the knowledge necessary to have the best chances.\n\nI am a little discouraged as VP of Quality jobs in software seem to be very rare, the closest related VP of Technology and VP of Engineering roles seem to be more common - so I figure I should begin thinking about how to make this horizontal transition moving up if VP of Quality roles do not present themselves in my supposed timeline.\n\nHere are things I am currently doing:\n\n1.\tActively networking - I have worked in a few startups and medium sized businesses and make sure to keep in touch with old coworkers.  I do this because, up to this point, almost every job I’ve loved has been the result of a referral.  This is even true with the leadership roles I was offered, even when I felt like I was not skilled enough in business, management, and engineering but these two bosses believed in me because of my past experiences working with them.  I call at least one former colleague once a month too.\n2.\tContinuous learning - I subscribe on an off to various course platforms to learn the latest skills I need.  This includes tools and languages for testing but have been growing to include skills related to Site Reliability.  \n3.\tCommunicate my career growth - My current and former bosses know/knew that I want to follow in their footsteps, and as a result, they often ask me to pick up some of their management/leadership tasks from time-to-time which has led me to my current career.  \n4.\tBrowse jobs - I know that I have a few more years to go before I a hiring manager seriously considers me for the VP roles but I want to understand the expectation of these roles so I regularly read up on what the latest job applications list in their requirements and descriptions.\n5.\tCreate a list of small companies that I want to work at or can possibly help grow if they ever need a executive level engineering role.  These are the companies where I’ll routinely take a look at for listings.\n\nQuestions I have:\n\n1.\tOther than finding a job traditionally, is there any other way to find these jobs?  Do I need to work with a recruiter in the future?  Or can I bootstrap this myself and just job seek on platforms like LinkedIn and in my network?\n2.\tI do not have a degree in CS.  I am self-taught.  I have a few former colleagues in similar situations who are now CTOs of small tech-startups, which gave me some hope.  But I have also worker for bosses who have a CS degree. At the very least, I figure maybe I should get some certifications perhaps?  Any feedback or experiences on this is much appreciated.\n3.\tShould I try harder to swap into a non-QA role to help my chances?  I.e. Site Reliability or Software Engineering?\n4.\tMost of my work has been in helping small companies scale and either selling the company or acquiring other companies.  Should I try to work in big corporations to give myself more visibility, or will small companies be looking for similar experiences when hiring the roles I’m looking for?\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this.

        "text": "Hello all, I am looking to go into the Computer Science field and am kinda at a crossroads. I have a really unique situation. So I graduated last year with a Liberal Arts degree from a major university, I am currently an Associate Product Manager. My job pays for bachelors degrees and I am deciding between two computer science programs, Each would take two years to finish. I also plan to get my MBA within a few years of completing this degree as well. SNHU vs Oregon State’s Postbach. program. SNHU I have a much higher likelihood of getting a 3.8-4.0 vs ORST it seems like. In the computer science field, equalling Product Management at tech companies would the simple fact of having a CS degree + MBA matter more than where I got that CS degree from? I also think the higher GPA would be worth it because the school I want to get an MBA from doesn’t require the GRE for very high GPA’s in the range mentioned above. Thanks!",

But at what point does this turn into something that's not really representative of an optimal grade? I've heard people say \"anything above a 3.7 is fine\", in the sense that no one would bat an eye at a 3.8 GPA candidate even in comparison to one with a 4.0. What should I roughly aim to stay above so that my grade appears optimal? I know that grade isn't the be-all end-all of a resume but I'd like something to aim for.",

In the interview they said its mostly software dev, and then connecting wires. I wanted to know what I could expect in terms of language, programming type (OOP vs FP). Any leads on anything I should brush up on or be familiar with would be cool. Really any input from anyone who has worked in that area would be helpful. I figured this would be the community to ask since there's such a wide range of software devs. Thank you :)",
