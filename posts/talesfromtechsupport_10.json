        "text": "\\#import &lt;firstTimePosting.h&gt;\n\n\\#import apologies.h\n\n\\#import &lt;POSJokes.h&gt;\n\nHi humans! This is gonna be (hopefully) a two-ish part story about some good ol' drama between me, *POS Company*, and my co-workers.\n\nOkay so some context. I was hired by a grocery store with a focus on imported UK goods to initially do normal stocking and crappy stuff but was promoted to do tech around the store, including but not limited to the POS (no, it's point of sales ya' dummy!) system. For context, we were using *POS Company*, which revolves around the use of *Fruit Tablet* and such. The owners went with them because they gave us a cheap rate because we were the first grocery store to utilize their hardware (totally not beta testing...). Five-ish years later, the hardware they supplied us is annoyingly old. The card swipes couldn't do EMV (and yes, we got chargeback-ed all the time) and the *Fruit Tablet*s were EOL-ed by *Fruit*. \n\nFast forward to two-ish months ago, I annoyed the owners and after two years, I finally got approval to upgrade the POS hardware. Didn't have any problems with it, it was faster than our old setup and we could finally be EMV-complient.\n\nFast foward to two-ish weeks ago, I purchased the new *Fruit Tablet*s from *Fruit* (I got some weird looks, but meh I've been through worse) and I installed them. I installed mobile management (basically connects to the wifi and a lock screen notice), installed the POS apps, and re-provisioned them according the *POS Company*'s specs. \n\nThat's when it all started to go down hill. Fast.\n\nThe day after I installed the new *Fruit Tablet*s, it was great! You didn't have to wait 5 seconds to weigh the apples or wait 2 seconds to input cash, it was instant and everyone fell in love with it. If you ignore the fact that the *Fruit Tablet*s are physically smaller than the old ones so now I have to get approval to buy new stands (which will happen in 2 years), it was pure bless.\n\nSadly, Satan decided to ruin the fun.\n\nA few hours after opening, there was this strange issue where using the chip would show \"Processing\\n Do not remove card...\" until the card reader decided it took too long and it timed out. You had to try to do this 3-4 times before it would actually finish processing, and then half the time it would spit out a \"Declined\" error. But it actually charged the card, even though it was \"declined.\" The weirder thing is that the problem only happened with one of the checkstands, the other one was processing payment swimmingly.\n\nOh, did I tell you we also had payments that were captured, but then declined?  (Kill me)\n\nI tried to fix it doing everything I can (restarted the pin pads, restarted the *Fruit Tablet*s, re-provisioned the *Fruit Tablet*s, restored the *Fruit Tablet*s, reset the routers and modem, heck I even turned off and on the bed scanner cause I was a desperate man that needed a break). I called *POS Company* in desperation and in a nutshell, this is how it went:\n\n&gt; POS: \"Did you try resetting the pinpads, the *Fruit Tablet*s, and any routers?\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"Yes\"\n\n&gt; POS: \"Did you tr-\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"Yes.\"\n\n&gt; POS: \"...ummm, let me transfer you to Tier 2\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"kk thanks\"\n\nI'm gonna skip over the boring stuff, like swapping the pinpads between the checkstands and resetting the backend, because none of that worked. After two weeks of suffering, pain, and many overtime hours, *POS Company* basically threw in the towel. That conversation went something like this:\n\n&gt; POS: \"We don't know what's happening, we'll call you back\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"^#(#&amp; WHAT DO I TELL MY BOSS\"\n\n&gt; POS: \"We apologize for the inconvenience, but we'll get to the bottom of this\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"BUTBUT WHAT DO I TELL MY BOSS\"\n\n&gt; POS in a passive-agressive voice: \"Do you have anything else I can help you with?\"\n\nNote, I tried calling our payment processor but they told me that I don't have \"authorization to talk to them about this issue\" and that I need to contact *POS Company* or validate as an owner with a merchant ID and the bank account number where funds are deposited into (I don't have the bank account number, and more about the owners below), so that was a dead end.\n\nDuring this time, my co-workers turned on me. They blamed me for breaking the system and preventing them from checking out anyone else. The owners, thankfully, are never in the store and don't respond to phone calls, so I was safe (for now...). I can't blame them for blaming me, but still, how should I've known that upgrading to new *Fruit Tablet*s could be such a hassle?\n\nAnd that brings us to current day, where I have bickering co-workers, non-responsive owners, and a POS company that can't fix the bloody problem. I don't know when this will be fixed, and if it ever is, there shall be a part 2 of how the fk I get this stupid system to work.\n\nSomeone, help? In the mean time, I'll be stocking some *Computer Brand* sauce...\n\n^Hope ^this ^is ^in ^the ^right ^place, ^it's ^kinda ^between ^/r/TalesFromRetail ^and ^/r/talesfromtechsupport. ^If ^not ^please ^tell ^me ^and ^I'll ^go ^away\n\n^Also ^English ^isn't ^my ^first ^language, ^so ^sorry ^if ^me ^no ^English",

        "text": "To preface this, this is family tech support, not professional tech support. I don't work in tech support, I just know roughly how to use computers. \n\nTo preface the actual story. I have a relative who has a severe mental illness, and my grandfather goes out of the way to care for him. I don't know the actual details, but he told me that he helped him read up on some internet manuals for Risk, (The game), and that he had gotten an older copy off eBay because it was cheaper than buying a newer version, and he couldn't get it to work. \nBad sign #1: It's a physical disk, not a digital download. This isn't necessarily bad, but it was a sign of things to come. Bad sign #2: The package this disk came in had a label on it, simply saying: \"Win 95.\" You can probably figure out what that means. \n\nAfter a bit of googling, and even more frustrating trouble shooting, I clicked through some options, to the backwards compatibility section, and told Windows to run it as Windows 95. To my surprise, it launched into what appeared to be a virtual machine set up by the eBay seller. This was great at cementing my position as the computer guru, but I don't know what other horrific encounters are to come. \n\nThe kicker? The game cost $30 from eBay, but a new copy only costs $10 on Steam.",

        "text": "My job is to provide technical support for 3D printers. Most of my exchanges are pretty tame, if mind-numbing, but there is one customer who has always made me wonder what was going on with him. Today I found out.\n\nThis customer opens multiple tickets in a week, often taking three or four responses to get the information I need to resolve the issue since it never seems like he can answer more than one question at a time, and yet many of his emails are interspersed with comments or critiques on how I format or phrase my questions and instructions. Today his ticket was about one of the motion directions not working correctly. \n\nI provided an explanation of why the problem would have developed, and included a link to our support article on the subject, which includes specifics on what tools and materials to use to perform the operation. When I include a link I always have the same format: I summarize what needs to be done and end the sentence with a colon. Then I skip a line, add the link, which is formatted blue, as most links are, and then another skipped line, so the link ends up as the only text in the middle of white space. Then I continue with any additional information. I have kept the same format for the last two years with very few problems.\n\nThis user came back with an immediate request for more information. Not a problem except that the questions he asked were answered in the introduction of the support article. Then he sent another response saying that he had found the information he needed in an old, out of date resource. So I referred him to the same link, pointing out that the answers were in the article and that the resource he was using was out of date and incorrect. As I attempt to give the benefit of the doubt, I said that if he wasn't able to click on the link please let me know and I would send him the article itself. His response was that he didn't see the link in my original email and that in order to be more clear I should format it in one of his three provided examples. Then he went on to state how he always had trouble with the support pages and how they should be indexed and linked. \n\nThe part that I found most asinine about this whole exchange was that in the time required for four exchanges and to find the incorrect information in an old and out of date resource he could have read the original response, clicked on and read the link, and had all of the information he needed. Not to mention the time required to provide examples of how to format for his benefit. \n\nWhen I closed the ticket I mentioned that we had already provided the index for the support pages and it looked like he might be having trouble seeing links, so he might need to look into removing any customized color themes on his device of choice. His response:\n\n\" I can see the links, in obvious blue, but not necessarily instantly recognize them as such. And can hardly see the colon at the end of a sentence that you probably think makes it obvious that the next line is a link. I'm always in a hurry here and skim for facts. Please make things more obvious.\"\n\nThis user has in the past claimed to be a \"Java expert\". I wonder if he got his \"certification\" the same place as the GoogleBing lady?",

        "text": "So, back to my days offshore... Because our boats were overseas or in the middle of the ocean, we had spares for pretty much everything.\n\nSo, we've been out to sea for a couple of weeks and all is well. My processing station had a SCSI external drive enclosure with 6 5.25\" bays. In this tower were 4 hard drives and two tape drives. I don't recall if we had 18gb drives or 9gb drives, but they were in a RAID 5 and we had a pair of Exabyte 8mm tape drives in the same enclosure. After about two weeks, my daily backups started having issues. Sometimes failing completely, sometimes taking far longer on one drive than the other ( we always made tapes in pairs ). After 3-4 days of random weirdness, tape drive 0 stopped responding completely.\n\nWell, crap! That's not good. So, I pull tape drive 0 out and put in one of our spare tape drives. We had four tape drives that were ready to be used and we had two spares. Things were great for another week or so, then tape drive 1 starting failing. The difference is that instead of misbehaving for 3-4 days, it just stopped responding. Okay, now I'm getting worried. I swap in our last spare and 2 days later, the new tape drive 0 dies. I'm down to just drive 1, now backups are taking twice as long. The next day, drive 1 goes offline. There is no way in hell I killed 4 tape drives in two weeks. For all the spares we had on board, the one thing we didn't have a spare for was the actual enclosure that the tape drives were in. I swapped SCSI cables, unseated and reseated basically everything. Nothing helped. I decided that maybe, just maybe it was a power issue. I didn't have a spare tower, but what I did have was a single bay external cdrom enclosure. So, I pulled the cover off the big tower and pulled the cover off the small enclosure and I ran the molex power cables from the small enclosure to the tape drives in the big enclosure. Voila! Everything worked! The only problems were... I didn't have ANY other spare power supply, the covers had to be off of both cases, the cables in the small enclosure were so short that I had to lean it against the big tower to reach. So... we spent the rest of the job with those two enclosures bungee corded together and both bungee corded down to the desk ( this was a ship, after all ). I was able to verify that all four tape drives were perfectly fine, they just weren't receiving enough power. The client rep actually took pictures of my kludge and sent them to his boss. I got an atta boy and I made sure that we had spare power supplies and a spare tower for all future jobs.",

        "text": "Hello! I'm a long time reader, first time submitter! This story is about video editing software, and all the fun stresses of a young, overly confident student.\n\nStarring:\n\n* **My younger sister:** currently in her second year of university for film/media studies\n* **Myself:** by no means a computer expert. A 2015 graduate of graphic design and currently working in digital design with some minor After Effects video editing sprinkled in\n* **Our dad:** a backend developer who is the one responsible for me even getting into digital work at all, but has mentally halted in 2005 when it comes to new tech. Also an avid hater of all things Apple.\n\n\nA short while ago, back around the beginning of the year, on a Sunday at 1pm, my sister attempts to FaceTime me. I was having brunch with someone, so I asked if she could call me back in an hour. About 10 minutes later she messages me *\"Nevermind, I don't need your help! :)\"*\n\nI double checked *\"Are you sure?\"* and she insisted *\"Yup! Don't worry about it\".* So I forgot about it.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nAround 6:30pm that night while I was at home, I get another FaceTime call from her. Her face is red, tear-streaked, she's hysterically crying, basically screaming at me through the video feed, and hiccuping through her angry-tears.\n\n**Sister:** It's fucked up! It's all fucked up! I don't know what the hell is going on but none of my work is saved! It's all gone! I don't get it! What the fuck! *[more swearing and declarations of confusion]*\n\n**Me:** Hold on, what do you mean? What happened? What were you trying to do? Was this the same thing you called me about earlier?\n\n**Sister:** YES!!! NONE OF MY WORK SAVED AND I JUST WASTED LIKE, FIVE HOURS! *AND* THIS IS DUE TOMORROW!\n\n**Me:** .... Okay.... Well--\n\n**Dad:** *[suddenly appearing in the background as he walks into the room with my hysterical sister]* You were supposed to help her! She called you and you didn't help. You know about this stuff, she doesn't!\n\n**Me:** Okay, FIRST OFF, this is her school work, not mine. She's learning how to do this stuff, not me, and I'm not her teacher. Second, I'm not a video editor, I just use the programs a bit at work. I don't \"know these things\" any more than she could using Google to find a tutorial. THIRDLY, she said she didn't need me anymore! She said she figured it out and was very confident as such.\n\n**Dad:** *[grumbling, not wanting to admit I'm right]*\n\n**Me:** [Sister], what is the problem? What are you trying to do?\n\n**Sister:** I have all this footage from my group project, and the cleaned up audio from [group member], and now it's my job to replace the old audio on the video with the new audio, and then give it back to the rest of my group.\n\n**Me:** Alright. And what were you doing? Show me.\n\n&gt;\t*At this point I have her rotate her phone so I can see her laptop screen and make her walk me through her process. She was using Adobe Premiere, which I have very limited experience with, but is similar enough to After Effects (layout-wise anyway) that I can feel my way around.*\n\n**Sister:** Okay so, I put my files in here... *[shows me the asset panel]* And then I pull the video in here... *[shows me her dragging it into the workspace panel]* And then I unattach the old audio and delete it. And then I pull in the new audio... and I highlight both, and click \"attach audio\"...\n\n**Me:** Okay, that all seems fine--\n\n**Sister:** And then I hit the save button, and then I highlight it all and hit delete, and start the next one.\n\n**Me:** OH MY GOD NO!\n\n&gt;\t*Now, if you know anything about Premiere or After Effects, you know that you have to save your work in sequences/compositions, which go in your asset panel as well. Otherwise it's just floating in nothing, goes no where, and disappears when you clear your workspace.*\n\n**Sister:** What do you mean NO??? I SAVED IT!\n\n**Me:** No, you didn't. You just drew something and shook the Etch-a-Sketch and started over. Every time you hit delete, you got rid of everything you did. Did you not think to check this? \n\n**Sister:** *[angry crying and hand motions of exasperation]*\n\n**Me:** Uhh okay, well, let me figure this out...\n\nI then proceeded to spend about 10 minutes making her click through Premiere for me to help her figure out how to create a new sequence, save it, and ensure it all showed up in the right place and didn't disappear anymore. Something she could have figured out herself if she used Google for like 2 seconds.\n\nAnyway, end of the story: I called her the next day to ensure all went well, she she sort of bashfully told me it was fine and thanked me for helping her. I made her promise not to waste hours of time doing work she wasn't 100% sure she was doing right. \n\nYou ever feel like the younger generation that grew up with the internet and smartphones always there, are way less inclined to troubleshoot? And olds think if you know any kind of tech, you know ALL THE TECH?\n\nYeah.",

They sent me a photo and everything.\n\nSo I go on site, expecting to see some form of idiocy. I immediately get hit with this:\n\n$Client = Hi $FieldSupport. We worked with $Client and we've come to the understanding that this issue is 100% the program.\n\n$FieldSupport = Yeah? What program are you referring to, $Client?\n\n$Client = Windows 10.\n\n$FieldSupport = You're running Windows 7, $Client. Why don't you elaborate on your issues?\n\nAfter being wasted for about 20 minutes on other unrelated issues, he demonstrated something amazing. He had somehow rigged the HDMI cable into the DP port on the back of a screen. Not only that, everytime he would attach power to it (as he constantly disconnected it) would the other monitors trip, his PC would eventually suffer a BSOD. \n\nSo gun-go, replace the cable that I'm not sure where he got it from and the issue resolved.

As this situation has changed, and its costing us a lot of money to keep this site on-line, we're planning to get rid of it completely, by getting a direct layer-2 tunnel (dot1q) through a client/supplier of ours.\n\n**$me**: keeper of (ssh) keys, protector of subnets and the spanning tree, guardian of the company's digital realm.\n\n**$doofus**: sloth-like colleague at our HQ Datacenter\n\n**$srtech**: my direct boss / senior technician, also my sparring partner for technical problems.\n\n**$nondoofus**: other colleague at our HQ Datacenter, is not sloth-like, or a doofus.\n\nWe start our adventure with $srtech, who is ordering our layer2 tunnel at our supplier.\n\n&gt;$srtech: I'm trying to order this l2 line but its taking forever to get a hold of someone, please escalate.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: Maybe we should try 'stalking' our account manager every single working day?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$srtech: Let's do it.\n\nAnd so it became, that we phoned up our account manager every single day until that line was delivered, but little did we know that this was only the start of our misfortune.\n\n&gt;$srtech: Hey, line's been delivered at last, I'll e-mail you port positions so we can get the patches made.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: awesome, I'll start configuring some ports so we can test this sucker.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$srtech: Make sure you call up $doofus so he can patch the tunnel on our end at HQ.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: sure.\n\nSo I ring up $doofus with the port positions so he can make a patch.\n\n&gt;$me: Yo $doofus, I need a favor, can you make a patch from SUPPLIER\\_SWITCH\\_PORT to OUR\\_PORT for me?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: oh and before I forget, I need this done by the end of the day so I can test this thing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$doofus: sure thing I'll give you a call when it's done.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: cool, thanks!\n\nIn the meantime I get our intern to make the patch from the supplier to our core switch in our datacenter, and I'm ready for liftoff, awaiting $doofus.\n\nA few hours later I still haven't gotten a call, but it's the end of the day, so I figure I'll call the next day.\n\n&gt;$me; Hey $doofus, did you get that patch done for me that I asked about yesterday?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$doofus: Nah it was too busy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\* at this point I already know he's talking out of his ass, because he does fuck all every day. \\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: oh that sucks, but I really need this thing today, so can you please shift some stuff in your 'schedule' and do it ASAP?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$doofus: sure I'll see what I can do.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: awesome, thanks.\n\nAs it so happens, $doofus came up from his chair, and wrestled the very dangerous Cat6A UTP snake into the cable rails, and into the ports. So a little after lunch I was finally able to get my testing going.\n\n&gt;\\&gt; I start by bringing up the ports on both ends, which goes a little as follows:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Port goes into autonegotiate  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Link state up, protocol down  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Half/ duplex 100Mbit/s.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Link state up, protocol up  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*2 seconds\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt;Link state down, protocol down.\n\nAt this point I've been diagnosing for about an hour, trying to change duplex modes, changing speed modes, autonegotiate, nothing works.\n\nI ring up the supplier and ask them what's what.\n\n&gt;$me: I'm having some issues with a connection, it keeps coming up on half-duplex, and goes down again after a bit.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$supplier: Hm let me take a look.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*about an hour of back-and-forth troubleshooting, trying different MTU values, different speeds, duplex modes, nothing works.\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: confusing how it goes online only when you set it to half-duplex 100mbit/s, could this be a cabling issue  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$supplier: Not sure, it does have connection, so it seems cabling is not at fault.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: What type of switch are you running on your end?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$supplier: it's a Cisco Catalyst 3560G.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: Okay I've got a cisco 7609 on my end, so it shouldn't be a problem, but I'll go look up some datasheets and get back to you if i find a possible solution.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$supplier: Alright that's good, talk to you later.\n\nAt this point I'm looking up the port features for this C3560G because I've got a suspicion it doesn't have the fancy features my switch has.  \nAnd then it hits me in the face like a flyswatter hitting you at mach 5.\n\n    Auto-MDIX is enabled by default. When you enable auto-MDIX, you must also set the interface speed and duplex to auto so that the feature operates correctly.\n\nThe port we have from our supplier is hard-set to 100mbit/s, so its not on auto.\n\nI enter the datacenter floor wielding a pair of side cutters, RJ45 crimpers, and an RJ45 connector and do my magical TIA 568A to TIA 568B cross cable trick.\n\nBack at the office I log into the switch, turn the port back on with the settings correct.\n\n&gt;\\&gt; Link state down, protocol down  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Link state up, protocol down  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Link state up, protocol up  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Full duplex, 100Mbit/s\n\nI do a little victory dance and quickly grab my phone to call up $doofus.\n\n&gt;$nondoofus: Yo $me, what's up?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: Hey is $doofus there, I need a favor.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$nondoofus: No he's out of office at the moment, can I leave a note?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: Yeah can you ask him to make that cable he patched for me yesterday into a cross-cable?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$nondoofus: Sure I'll tell him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: Awesome, thanks!\n\nThe next day I ring up $doofus, to ask him if he got around to making that cross-cable, but obviously he was too busy doing whatever.\n\nAnother day passes before I finally have enough control over the Force to lift $doofus out of his chair to get him to do something for me.\n\n&gt;$me: Hey $doofus did you make that cross-cable for me?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$doofus: Yeah I made the cross-cable, its all good and patched in the DC.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: awesome, I'll go and test it later.\n\nAnd so later that day I start to test it.\n\n&gt;\\&gt; Link state up, protocol down  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Half/ duplex 100Mbit/s.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Link state up, protocol up\n\nAt this point I'm beating my head against the desk in a vain attempt to mix up the information in my head into a solution, to no avail.\n\nI think to myself, $doofus must know how to make a cross-cable right? But it's doing the exact same thing when we had a straight cable connected...\n\nAnd so I pick up the phone once more...\n\n&gt;$nondoofus: Hey $me, what's up?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: Hey is $doofus around, i need to ask him something.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$nondoofus: he just left his spot, probably going to the bathroom.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: alright, maybe you know, did he happen to test the cable before he patched it?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$nondoofus: Yeah he used the cable tester and he said all lights lit up just fine.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: all lights lit up huh? with that 10$ cheap-o-meter you guys use, right?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$nondoofus; yeah I think so, oh here comes $doofus, I'll ask him real quick.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*$nondoofus asks $doofus if the cable tester had all lights on during testing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$nondoofus: yeah he says all lights lit up on the tester.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: okay, can you please drive to the DC for me, with a pre-made, known-good cross cable, and an RJ-45 coupler?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$nondoofus: Yeah sure, but why?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: please just trust me and do it please.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$nondoofus: ok sure, I'll call you when I'm at the datacenter.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: awesome, thank you.\n\nAt this point I have a 99% certainty what the problem is here, and I wish I could bitch-slap $doofus so hard it goes down 3 generations.\n\nHalf an hour passes and $nondoofus rings me up\n\n&gt;$nondoofus: Yo $Me, I'm at the datacenter, what do you want me to do?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: Okay walk to our core switch, and unplug the port that $doofus patched on.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$nondoofus: done.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: okay now connect the coupler block, and connect the crosscable to the port and the coupler.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$nondoofus: alright that's done.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: Ok give me a second to verify.\n\nI log in to the switch and turn on the port.\n\n&gt;\\&gt; Link state down, protocol down  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Link state up, protocol up  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Full duplex, 100Mbit/s  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Trunk online, VLANs forwarding.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: $nondoofus, you still there?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$nondoofus: yep, still here.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: okay we're all set here, when you get to the office I want you to go to the storage closet.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: when you get to the storage closet, I want you to pick up the old Cisco 7201 router we have lying around there, and I want you to hit $doofus with it so hard, that he comes back to his senses.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$nondoofus: \\*laughing loudly\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$nondoofus: why's that? \\*still laughing\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: Because this idiot made a STRAIGHT cable, when I asked him to make a CROSS cable.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: The reason is, he used that cheap shitty tester you guys have, and it only measures straight cables properly.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: all lights lit up, indicating it was a straight cable..  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$nondoofus: haha, this is going to make for a great story.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: thanks a lot $nondoofus, I'll talk to you later.\n\nFlabberghasted I tell the story to $srtech.\n\n&gt;$me: Finally managed to get that L2 tunnel online.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$srtech: Really? finally. what was the problem?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: $doofus.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$srtech: \\*looks at me confused\\* eh, what?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: I asked him to make a cross cable for me, and he made a straight cable, convinced it was cross.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: I asked $nondoofus to put in a good pre-made cross-cable with a coupler, it works now.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$srtech: \\*laughing at this point\\* Good.\n\nAnd that is how my colleague managed to waste a few days of my time troubleshooting by not knowing how to use the equipment he has to handle.\n\nTo this day I'm not sure he really knows how to make a cross-cable, and I don't intend to ask him to make one for me again.\n\nWhat a shitshow that was....",

        "text": "So this tale took place years ago when I was still working for a major ISP here in the states. Some back story of what I did and the product that I'm about to tell: I was originally hired as tier 2 tech and was on many different projects and was first hired about a year after they've released their new product. About a year and a half of working their, this ISP finally released static IPs for customers who wanted them (pretty cheap too, it was $5 for a block of 8 IPs if I recall correctly). Problem is that the static IPs aren't actually truly \"static\" in the sense that you can simply plug it into whatever you're using it for and it'll work and what not. No, this is what you'll call Sticky IP. There is a way to get it to work the original way but it's a PITA and half the time it doesn't work so just doing it the way that this ISP wants you to do it is the only viable option.\n\nAt the time of this call that came it, it was when our call center was still business support and click to chat. I was sitting next to my coworker and he just got done helping this customer getting his Sticky IP address setup and confirmed to work for a server that he was trying to get setup but now this customer has a question about setting up the DNS for it to work correctly. Mind you this coworker I'm sitting next to is also a roommate, we both know each other strengths and weakness and he knows that I know quite a bit about DNS and how it works so he asked me if I can take the call and help him out with his question. Sure no problem.\n\nSo he passes me the call and I started talking with the customer. He told me what he was trying to do. Basically he's trying to set it up so when someone types in an address of [whatever.yourname.com](https://whatever.yourname.com) it'll go to his static (sticky) IP address. He also informed me that he's under the impression that he needed to do this with a reversed DNS.\n\nFirst of, if you have any clue how DNS works, the only time you would need to worry about a reverse DNS is if you're setting up an email server on that IP address to help ID other mail servers the origin of the email did came from the IP address, very rare other protocols would bother with reverse DNS look ups.\n\nSecond, I can't really fault the guy into thinking that since a few agents in the center told him that and that's because most agents doesn't have a clue how DNS works. Doesn't help that most of them aren't truly techs since our scope of support is limited to just making sure that the gateway is getting sync/service and making sure that there isn't much wrong with the hardware. The only thing extra that we do is making sure that the sticky IPs are configured correctly in the gateway and even then only a good handful of agents are good at that (my roommate was god at this and can make sure your device is getting that damn sticky IP address otherwise it'll drive him mad until he gets it working).\n\nAnyways, I told him a reverse DNS is not needed unless he's planning on running an email server off of that IP address and told him what he really needed to do, to go into the registrar or whoever is managing the DNS and add an A record of [whatever.yourname.com](https://whatever.yourname.com) pointing to the static IP that my roommate helped him set up (and works when going to the IP address). So after he confirmed what was needed, I offered to give him a call back the next day to make sure it was working since DNS propagation takes time. He agreed and went on our way.\n\nNext day I called him and he told me that the server had died which was ironic since he was all set, everything was working, couldn't wait to show his client the finished product when the server died. Told him no problem and gave him my agent ID and told him that when he gets the server back up and working and needs help with getting the static IPs reconfigured and what not to call and ask for me by my agent ID.\n\nAbout 3 weeks pass and never heard from him, and honestly completely forgotten about him (you know, working in a call center, you deal with about 20 to 40 customers a day) until he called and luckily gotten me. Only reason I even remembered him was because the moment I pulled up his account and saw my case notes and him describing my issue I knew who I was talking to.\n\nTurns out that he lost my agent ID that he had written down, got the new server and needed help with getting it configured, thought he'd tried his luck with other agents but the other agents did jack shit (other then to put in a request to set up reverse DNS which was completely unnecessary for his application, and he's been fighting the battle for about 2 weeks, probably less.\n\nI was like, \"OK, so just to be sure, you have not changed your DNS record at all during this all time, right? [whatever.yourname.com](https://whatever.yourname.com) is still pointing to this IP address, right?\" and the customer confirmed. So I logged into our gateway, confirmed how his server is configured and is currently set for DHCP, confirmed the device, and reset back up the sticky IP. We've tested it, confirmed it's working, and the customer was glad he was able to talk to me in the end.\n\ntl;dr: customer needed DNS setup for his static IP, informed him how to go about it, his server crashed, provided agent ID so he can talk to me to make sure everything is set back up correctly once new server comes in, customer lost it and went through hell for about 2 weeks before luckily getting a hold of me from a random luck of the draw and fixed his issue that other agents couldn't figure out wasting the customer's time.",

        "text": "So, this is a story from a year or so ago. Let me set the scene, I'm a games developer, which means that my family and friends tend to assume that I'm some sort of all knowing computer focussed deity. This leads to many Tech support phonecalls, usually for 5 minute solutions like, \"OfficialPiAddict, I can't figure out how to turn in this windows desktop, the power button doesn't do anything\". To which I tell them to look for a \"big box under the desk\". That usually resolves the problem. \n\nMy grandmother however, usually manages to get herself into more sticky situations. While I have many tales of her Tech issues, the one that stands out the most is the following.\n\nGrandma: Hey OfficialPiAddict, sorry to bother you, but I'm just working on a book at the moment, and I want to print it.\n\nMe: That sounds great grandma, have you tried going to File-&gt;Print?\n\nGrandma: *minute of deliberation* Yes. I've tried that. \n\nMe: Okay, well did that work for you?\n\nGrandma: No. It only printer a single page.\n\nMe: When you open the print dialogue, can you see a little field that mentions a \"page range\"?\n\nGrandma: *minute of working* yes.\n\nMe: Great, what does it say there?\n\nGrandma: it says All.\n\n*At this point I double check with her that the values are correct, and they are. I'm thinking that Word might be bugged, so I ask her to restart her computer. She does, and there's no change. I'm getting a bit confused here, as I run through some other common problems with her. It's now ~20 minutes into the call*\n\nMe: Okay grandma, can you just run me through how you make your book?\n\nGrandma: yes. What I do is, I type down what I want it to say. Then I put in my images, and I arrange them on the page where I want them.\n\n*So far so good*\n\nGrandma: And then when I want a new page, I go to the top, and I press on the file. And then I press new, and it gives me a new page.\n\n..........\n\nThis took me a second to process. After some investigation, it turned out that she had created an entire 250 page book, filled with formatting and images, and every single page was it's own document. She had a folder of 250 word documents that she wanted to print.\n\nI explained it all to her, and mentioned that a new page would just appear on its own when you got to the bottom of a document. She then hung up, and went about collating the documents. \n\nTLDR: Grandma tried to write a book, accidentally saved each and every page as it's own document. ",

        "text": "I work for a large healthcare equipment manufacturer, as a network engineer. My job is largely helping to integrate our equipment into the hospital network to allow communication. Because our equipment is regulated by the FDA, most of our policies and procedures are outdated and incredibly insecure. As such most of my time is apologizing for our policies and helping to find more secure ways to isolate our equipment, however when a hospital seems to be experiencing a network problem, I often get calls to assist in troubleshooting.\n\nNow for a large chunk of our customers we provide switches to provide an isolated environment for our equipment that we maintain, but for customers that don't want the added cost, or added rack space, we also allow them to connect our equipment to their network directly, provided that a) we validate that the network meets our specs, and b) they assume responsibility for any issue with their network. Of course the problem with this is that like all good network engineers know, it's not the network. It's never the network.\n\n\nBut unfortunately this time it definitely was.\n\n**The start of our tale**\n\nOur story starts Friday morning at 11:30, one of my field engineers contacts me to let me know that he had received reports from a local hospital that their equipment had gone down. This particular hospital had our equipment directly connected to their network, and this issue had occurred previously. The last time I had driven the three hours to the site, spent hours troublshooting our equipment only to receive a call the next morning to check if things were working now and everything to come up.\n\nThis time I was far too busy to drop everything and head off to the site, so I asked my coworker to move one of the non working pieces of equipment to the same switch as the controller it was supposed to register to, and see if it connected. If the connection worked, it stood to reason that the issue resided on the only part removed, the hospital network.\n\nLater that evening as I was headed out with the wife to a friend's house, I got a call from my coworker saying that he had done this, but had only been able to get ahold of the hospital on call network admin as the on site contact had left at 4 with things to do. Unfortunately fifteen minutes into talking to the on call person, and trying to explain how the issue clearly resided on their network, we were cut off because she \"had another issue to deal with, and I can clearly ping all of the switches\"\n\n**A dangerous situation **\n\nA brief aside here, this equipment is not some low priority value adding equipment. People's lives are attached to the operation of this equipment, and this outage was putting multiple people at risk. We learn early on to take these kinds of issues extremely seriously as a fault of our equipment that we ignore can leave us potentially personally liable. As such my coworker spent every minute he could on Saturday and Sunday trying to get the attention of someone in the IT organization to take this outage seriously.\n\nFinally Sunday night someone finally checked their messages, or the right ear got shouted in, and the issue became priority one. A bridge line was put together and the IT team was engaged, but as this was now a hot issue, no one wanted to take the blame. This was clearly an issue with the vendors equipment and they needed to stop blaming their network. I did my best to show that our equipment was working properly when isolated from the network, and requested packet captures to be able to pinpoint the source of the issue.\n\nI mentioned that this behavior I was seeing felt very much like some bizarre behavior with the connections between the switches (for the more technical, I specifically felt like this was something with the ether channel that connected the edge switches with two ten gig fiber lines back to their cores) this issue was shot down with an insistance that we troubleshoot first one then the next piece of our equipment and run in circles, until I was forced to drop off the call around 10 pm.\n\n**A long and frustrating night**\n\nThe next day I was occupied with other work, but about 9pm I get a call from my coworker on site asking to join the call again, as we have escalated this internally to our company, and a second field engineer had been sent on site. Once again I ask for packet captures to test my theory and once again get shot down. I spend **7** hours on the phone doing everything I can, and finally get them to span the ports that I need and send me the packet capture. In it, things look strange indeed. The registration packet of the device is indeed arriving at our controller, only to be ignored. This is beyond nuts to me and I briefly lose confidence that this is actually their network. We start swapping equipment around and bring in new equipment and yet no matter what we see the same effect, but only if the equipment is connected through their network. If it's moved to the same switch it connects immediately, once again pointing back to the hospital network.\n\nFinally at 5 am I drop off the call, needing to be on site at a different project early the next day, but troubleshooting continues through the night. Another field engineer is sent on site to help, and two more escalation people are brought in to troubleshoot. The same troubleshooting steps get repeated over and over again in escalation hell, and each time it points to the hospital network, but the network team has dug in their heals.\n\n**Anger begins to boil over**\n\nThe next day I join the call around 10am. We are berated by person after person from hospital IT for insisting this issue resided on their network. They are insisting on alternative equipment be shipped out right away (which we do) and complain that next flight out isn't fast enough. We are called incompetent and are told that we were not treating this issue with the severity it deserved. To the credit of my team we kept our comments civil, and our accusations on mute at least, despite many of us having been working on the issue for most of the past few days, giving up lots of personal time and sleep. I end up being mostly redundant at this point, and since I have nothing much to contribute to the call I end up dropping off around 10 pm to try and get some sleep. \n\n**A bizarre answer **\n\nThe next day I get a request from my boss to join an internal call around 11 am. This issue has escalated to the point that one of our coders has taken a look at the packet capture and noticed something. With the data portion of the packet, the devices MAC address and IP address are included, but the IP address portion of the the data has been changed from 10.x.x.x to 11.x.x.x. This suddenly explains why our system isn't responding to it, the address is completely incorrect now. Of course we don't know what is changing this packet, but we have solid proof now that this is not a fault with our equipment. We jump back on the call and present our findings.\n\n**Sunk cost behavior**\n\nNow of course this is day six of a major outage. Additional staff have been forced to work long shifts on the clinical side to deal with this situation and every executive has been on this call screaming for a solution. Hospital IT has been standing their ground this whole time that this issue is not on their network, so their response is to argue, to obstruct, and try to disprove this new info, going so far as to accuse us of making this up. \n\nNew packet captures are made, different pieces of equipment are removed and added and still the same result. I once again interject that this feels very much like an ether channel issue, and that it had been mentioned to be related to that previously. The lead network engineer of the hospital nearly lost his voice shouting me down that unless I had concrete proof I wasn't to bring up ether channels again.\n\nFinally we were able to convince them to get a capture of each hop. From each side of the connection working our way down the line. Finally we see it. A capture shows that between the core and the switch that has the controller, the data in the packet is changed. Someone else internal asks us to take this down to a single connection to see if this resolves the issue and after one last smoke screen from the hospital IT claiming that the information is changed even in the functioning device, a claim very easily and quickly shot down, they begrudgingly agree to take down one of the legs of the ether channel.\n\n** OH Shit. **\n\nAfter a brief issue with the ether channel breaking the connection entirely, finally one leg is taken down. Almost immediately, a huge chunk of the down network comes back. Everything starts to work, and those that were still having issues are able to be restored by breaking a leg on the switch ether channel.\n\n Suddenly hospital IT has become very quiet. I'm listening in on the call on mute, shouting abuse and laughing like a mad man in my car as I am driving. Text messages between my coworkers are flying laughing at the sudden cooperation we are being offered, as IT states they will have to open a ticket with their network vendor to find a root cause. After almost a week of critical outage time, the issue has been resolved by the very thing I had mentioned to them on the first day of the outage. \n\nNow to be one hundred percent fair, this is a very rediculous thing to happen. As one of my coworkers mentioned, this is like writing a letter, addressing it, and when it gets to its destination, still perfectly sealed, the contents of that letter are different. It shouldn't happen, and it really doesn't make a lot of sense, but after spending days being treated like a liar and a dunce, being right felt really, **really** good. \n\n**The fallout**\n\nNow during this call a LOT of big wigs at my company had been listening in, and they were very unhappy with the way our team had been treated. All of my team received instructions to make sure to log every possible minute of our time that we had spent working on this issue within the day. See this customer had not paid for a support contract with us Normally for a customer outage like this, we will usually ignore that to try and bring the system up, preferring happy customers, but in a wonderful foresight, the coworker who had gone on site the first day, had made sure to get a PO for this support call. The higher ups had paid for rush shipping, couriers, and nearly twelve resources on site or on remote support to appease this customer only to have the fault be exactly what had been communicated to them on the first day.\n\nA call was put together and a full time-line was worked up. None of it looked good for the customers IT team. In the heat of the outage the hospital big wigs had requested my company management team come for an on site meeting to discuss this issue, likely thinking that they would be able to squeeze out some favors and financial benefits from the fiasco, and now our execs were looking at handing over what will likely be a five or six figure bill.\n\nMeanwhile at the hospital, it was clear that IT was hoping to do damage control, they threw a \"Thank you\" party for their network team for finding the issue, but our team made sure that the full story was given to the clinical team. We got a very awesome thank you from the nurses later that day.\n\nIn the end we got a lot of praise from our bosses and we all felt good having actually found the root of this issue, something that may save us a lot of time in other similar situations down the road. For my coworkers, their paychecks are going to look really nice with all the overtime they were able to squeeze in (though unfortunately as a salary man I can't say the same) I definitely hope to hear what the vendor says was actually changing the data as it's a crazy bug, but in the end I think we were all too tired to really appreciate the shear train wreck beauty of this, so I felt I had to bring it to reddit. \n\n**tl;dr: A customer network team, faced with an outage, blames my company for six days, only to be proven in the most direct way that it is their network. Resume updating is nearly audible.**",

He's one of my favorite customers - a completely charming fellow who could rebuild a manaro engine with his eyes shut. \n\nHe calls me \"my backup drive isn't working\". So I book a call and head out and yep - it's definitely cactus so I pull it out and tell him I'll be back shortly with a new one for him. \n\nA week later I get another call from him. \"My backup drive is eating all my tapes. I'm down to my last one... please help\". Confused, I head back out that afternoon and wander into the shop with yet another drive packed.  I greet him and ask him what's going on. He shows me the last tape as I'm approaching the counter and look around at the screen, and I say \"ok, show me what's going on\" and he hesitantly says \"this is my last tape man\". So he shoves it into the computer and I hear this \"clunk\".... \n\nI start to grin... and go around the counter and sure enough - the hole from the drive I removed is still there (I had forgotten to book a time to replace the drive). He had been shoving the tapes into the gap and they had been dropping to the bottom of the PC case. \n\nI open the computer and retrieve the five tapes piled at the bottom and hand them too him. He was ever so relieved that I managed to salvage his tapes.... \"mate, there's no drive there at all.\"  \"Oh! I was wondering why it was so easy to insert them, so glad you could get them back for me\". He loved me forever after that.  I replaced the drive properly that day and he rang me that night to excitedly tell me the backup worked. \n\nBruno is my all time favorite customer. \n",

        "text": "I've been trying to think of a more recent tale to tell and life just handed me an opportunity. Rather than going back 18 years, this story is from last week. \n\nI'm currently working for a municipal police department with roughly 250 officers. The IT staff at the PD consists of 3 people; a programmer, a systems analyst, and a technical specialist. The idea is that the systems analyst handles server side stuff, the technical specialist handles user side stuff, and the programmer supports in house software and/or interfacing existing data with new software. In reality, it doesn't really break down that way. \n\nAn officer drops his laptop off with a note saying that the touchpad on his laptop doesn't work. My coworker ( systems analyst ) plugs the laptop in on our test bench and the touchpad works fine. She tries various things and nothing she can do replicates the problem. She puts a note on the laptop saying that it appeared to be working and left it in the watch office for him. \n\nThe officer drops the laptop off again the next day with a note saying that the touchpad still doesn't work. Again, she is unable to replicate the problem. She brings me in and tells me the symptoms and we decide that it must be something local to the officer's vehicle. We ask the officer to come by during business hours for us to take a look. \n\nThe officer comes by and we both verify that the touchpad is working. He starts plugging things in before I can stop him, and he's got a USB hub with 4 or 5 things plugged in, a power cable, a network cable, his GPS, etc... The touchpad no longer works. I assumed it had something to do with the USB hub and perhaps a faulty usb device, so I had him unplug that. The touchpad still doesn't work. I have him reboot the machine, but the touchpad STILL doesn't work. I have him unplug EVERYTHING, and the touchpad starts working again. After a little trial and error, we figure out that the touchpad stops working when the power is plugged in. \n\nI go to my office and grab a brand new power supply for him and as soon as we plug it in, the touchpad stops working. I am now dumbfounded. While I'm trying to puzzle out how this could possible be, the officer tells me that if he wiggles the power connector at the back of the laptop, his touchpad works intermittently. Huh, okay... Some sort of EMI from a bad solder joint on the motherboard power connector? So... I open a support ticket with the laptop manufacture. We discuss the symptoms we're seeing, run some diagnostics that all come up clean, and he decides to send out an internal power cord ( replacement DC jack ). \n\nWe swap out the jack, and the problem still exists, but only in the vehicle. I notify the laptop manufacturer and this time they send out a palmrest and motherboard. We get those swapped out, and the problem persists. I tell the officer that I'm going to give him a different inverter for his vehicle and he tells me that he already has a spare. I asked him to try using the spare inverter and report back. After the weekend, I have an email from the officer saying that he's still unable to use his touchpad. I am now completely stumped. We've changed EVERYTHING, right? I start doing research, I ask every tech person I can think of about the problem and we come up with absolutely nothing \n\nThe sergeant of planning and research comes by yesterday and tells me that he fixed the problem. How you ask? By changing out the officer's inverter. He apparently had a faulty inverter in his car. Which inverter did the sergeant swap for the faulty one? The spare that the officer already had.\n\n\\*sigh\\* \n\nThe officers are generally VERY good at following directions and giving good information about what they're seeing and what they've tried. This is a very unusual case in many ways, but I thought I had lost my tech touch. Sometimes I forget that even the best users lie, but that was only a very small piece of a very weird problem. \n\nCheers.",

        "text": "In my last post I said that I would tell this story which comes from the same account I work with, a private Christian school. To preface this story a little bit, my boss (who happens to be my father) and I started working there last year around September. Before we were there they had a teacher they promoted with zero technical knowledge doing things for a year after their full-time IT person that worked on everything from the cashiers in the snack shack to the servers and firewalls got let go. That IT manager, who we will refer to as Kelly, was very strict with her users and would not let them move even a single cable or device from one desk to another without her permission. She changed settings in the Active Directory to make users have to change their password every 3 months, so teachers and administrators usually had to make a new password 3 times during an entire semester. The teacher dekstops are Acer workstations from 2007 that came with Vista and have been upgraded to Windows 7. Of course, with this old hardware the computers have issues from time to time and they slow down and crash.\n\nWhich brings me to my story about one of my users, a middle school teacher I will refer to as **Crazy Lady** or **CL** for short. She is an older lady, probably in her 60s and has a shrill old lady voice, you can tell she is probably one of students least favorite teachers. I have been in her room before and heard her talking trash on her students to the other teachers about their math skills, as if she was not there to teach them anything and they were expected to be exceptional at math by the time they got to her class in middle school.\n\nThe first time I met her was when I first heard about her computer troubles. It was the first week of school, and she was outside near the lunch tables as I was walking back up to my office. She flagged me down and wanted to meet me, I said hello and told her my name and she told me hers. Immediately after she started complaining about a computer problem she was having.\n\n**CL:** We need more help here. My computer has problems all the time! I will be doing something on it, and then the next second it will just crash and shut down on me!\n\n**Me:** Oh no, you say it crashes on you? What are you doing before the computer crashes usually?\"\n\n**CL:** YES! It always crashes and it's so SLOW! Many times it won't let me log in no matter what I try, it is possessed!\"\n\nAt this point I just thought she was using a metaphor for how crappy the computer is.\n\n**Me:** Well, i'm sorry to hear that, I could take a look at it and see what is going on if you have time.\"\n\n**CL:** No, no! Don't even bother! They have tried to look at it many times, and it never lets me login to it. It is haunted, don't go near it.\n\nIt's.. Haunted? I don't really know what to say here, as it seems she doesn't want me to try looking at it.\n\n**Me:** Okay, well.. I guess just try again and if you have problems or want me to take a look at it let me know my office is-\n\n**CL:** It's okay! Don't worry about it! I powered it down, Pepe is sleeping right now. He just needs a good nap and maybe he will feel better.\n\nDid.. Did she just say Pepe? Is the computer named Pepe? I definitely heard her say Pepe as if that was the computer or maybe the ghost's name.\n\n**Me:** Okay.. Well you have a good day now.\n\n**CL:** You too!\n\nThat's where we parted ways, but that's not the end of the story.\n\nA few months after this we needed to install a client on everyone's machine for antivirus and remote monitoring. My dad wanted us to start in the middle school wing and move on from there. I see on his list that we have to do Crazy Lady's machine and I tell my dad \"Hey, this is the lady that thinks her computer is haunted.\" He thought it was kind of funny but not as funny as I did, and we got through the other machines and got into her room and approached her computer.\n\nAs we approached her computer, I noticed some pieces of paper taped to the top and the front of the computer. I read them, and this is what they said:\n\n*Please do not use. This is possessed! It will not let me log back in.*\n\n*Please do not touch.*\n\nI was cracking up in the classroom. My dad saw them and his expression was something between \"What the hell\" and \"Why do we have to deal with these crazies\". He sat down at the computer and I asked him if he was scared of the ghost inside of the computer, to which he replied no. The computer was already powered on and we logged on with our administrator account and installed our antivirus and remote monitoring software. We left the room and that was the last I have heard from Crazy Lady since then, other then the time I went into another teacher's classroom when she was there and trash talking one of her students. I think that she has since resigned or been let go, because I did not see her name on any of the rooms in the middle school wing, one can only hope. She creeps me out. I don't think she even uses her computer at all, we have not been requested to change her password even once, and we changed the Active Directory settings to password changes once at the start of a new semester.",

        "text": "I work for a cable ISP as tier 1 tech support. Mostly dealing with basic tech support issues: pay your bill on time, powercycle, password resets, ect. This story takes place over three separate calls. Two were mine, one was taken by the person sitting next to me, but all dealing with the same users.  Just a heads up, there's no happy ending here. Nothing gets resolved, just customers being unreasonable and making jerks of themselves. Out of curiosity, I do want to know how this story ends, so I'll be checking this account on Monday to see what/if there was a resolution to this.\n\nCast:\n\nMe &gt; VK\n\nOther Tech &gt; OT\n\nElderly Mom &gt; EM\n\nAdult Son &gt;  AS\n\n**Call 1**\n\nVK: {$GenericTechSupportIntro}\n\nAS: Hey, yeah, I just got transferred to you to activate something on my account. I'm not sure exactly what.\n\nVK: Ok, let's pull up your account and I'll take a look.\n\n*This customer was cold transferred from either billing or sales, by the sound of  things. I pulled the account, everything looks normal. Account's active. Modem's online. Nothing out of the ordinary-looking. And of course, the previous rep didn't leave any notes.*\n\nAS: (*talking while I'm looking over the account*) So I just called in and had my mother's services bundled, and I need help getting her service working because our WiFi modem isn't working now. I only have service in my room from a cable.\n\n*Pulled up the order, can't see where a second modem was decommissioned. It appears internet service was started from a phone-only account.*\n\nVK: Did you have a different ISP before you called in today?\n\nAS: No. Hey, let me call my mom and you can talk to both of us.\n\n*AS puts me on hold and dials in his mom. I'm conferenced in after they'd already been talking for a few minutes.*\n\nEM: - I want my \\*bleep\\* to work NOW, AS. I don't care what you have to do. Let this girl help you!\n\nAS: (suddenly very static-y) what.... can't...I'll call back later. Bye.\n\n**- 1st call ends -**\n\nI immediately go into after-call because my interest is piqued. From what I was able to tell, they had phone only until today, when they had HSD activated. Their device was a combination phone/ wired cable modem, so it wouldn't have working WiFi on it's own. At this point I suspect they had another ISP that one of them cancelled before we started talking, hence the suddenly non-working WiFi. I left notes on the account about what I found and carry on with my day.\n\n**Call 2**\n\nFast forward an hour or so: we're pretty slow, so I'm reading a book when my neighbor OT gets a call. I'm not really paying attention, but I can hear what she's saying. She gets done with the call with a weird look on her face, and tells me \"I just had your customer\", and relayed this story:\n\nOT:  {$GenericTechSupportIntro}\n\nAS: My WiFi isn't working.\n\n*OT pulls the account, reads my notes, attempts to verify my findings with AS.*\n\nAS: I didn't have another ISP! Just help me fix this!\n\n*OT tries to walk AS through basic troubleshooting: powercycle, bypass router, ect) Just like before, WiFi not working, able to surf through wired connection.*\n\nOT: OK, so it looks at this point like your router is not working properly.\n\nAS: That's what I thought. I'll fix it on my own.\n\n\\**click*\\*\n\n**- 2nd call ends -**\n\n**Call 3**\n\nFast forward another couple hours, and I get a call. This time it's a woman on the line.\n\nVK: {$GenericTechSupportIntro}\n\nEM: Hello, I had my internet turned on this afternoon and we need help getting it set up.\n\nVK: I'll be happy to help, lets pull up your account...\n\n*Pulled up account. Immediately recognize the account. I see my previous notes as well as OT's.*\n\nVK: Ah, okay, I remember speaking with your son earlier today. Is he still having trouble setting things up with that wired modem?  (*hint hint, y'all*)\n\nEM: Yeah, and I need this working because I work from home.\n\nVK: Are you home right now?\n\nEM: No, let me call my son and we'll all talk about it.\n\n*AS comes on the line, EM doesn't tell him I'm there, and immediately starts yelling at him.  I don't mean \"I'm frustrated\" yelling, I mean full on calling her son everything but a Child of God. I almost hung up but... it wasn't abuse directed at me, so I would have gotten dinged on it by QA.*\n\nEM: - now, this girl is going to help you.\n\nAS: I told you, mom, I don't need her help. I just need help here, but no one will do what I tell them!\n\nEM: Well maybe we need them to send someone out?\n\nAS: NO. DO NOT DO THAT. I CAN FIX THIS MYSELF.\n\n*More profanity from both ends. Wish I'd made popcorn on my last break about now.*\n\nEM: Don't act like that, I had this girl on the line here and now she's gone.\n\nVK: No ma'am, I'm still here.\n\nEM: See? She's still trying to help you.\n\nAS: \\*beep\\* I don't need any \\*beep\\* help. I told you I CAN FIX THIS MY \\*BEEEEEEEEEEEP\\* SELF!\n\nAnd the call drops.\n\n**- 3rd call ends -**\n\nWe had the answer following my first time speaking with these people. At this point we're 0/3 trying to get the point across to these people.\n\nLike I said before, I'll be checking out that account on Monday. I'm curious if they actually let us help them resolve this.\n\nEdit: formatting. I lurk more than I post, so some things come out messy. \n\n\n\n\n-Update-\nEventually someone sent a tech out for these people,  wherein the plot thickened. It was determined that most of my troubleshooting was right. Also,  when the tech went out he found they were running a business on a residential account. He found the other ISP's modem and our wired one and explained to them the issue was not actually with their service through us. \nEM tried to call back in later to complain to a manager about the tech not fixing the problem, and managed to get the field tech sup and the next higher sup involved. All managers tell her to stop calling and wasting people's time.  Also that she had x number of days to transfer to a biz account or have her account disconnected. \nSo...there's that.",

Part of this process involves getting the computer name and making sure it matches the asset tag. Most people have been friendly, but there is always that one person.\n\nThis lady was not happy that I was not there to fix her computer problems. I explained that at the moment I am just doing a detailed inventory but once that is done a support contract will be created and I’ll be able to help her. Right now all I need is for her to step away so I can read that asset tag and verify the computer name, I do not need her to do anything and I will not be signing her out or restarting the computer as I can get everything I need from the login screen.\n\nBecause she has the computer locked I do the needful and click on “Switch User” so I can see the computer name. Please note I did not sign her out, or sign myself in. I then clicked on her user icon so she can unlock the computer without having to do anything other than type her password. Mistakenly thinking that all is well I move on to the next computer.\n\n&gt;$User: Why did you sign me out? I takes forever to sign in.\n\n&gt;$Zer0: I didn’t sign you out, the screen in front of you shows that the computer is locked by $User, which matches the name on your ID. (Because we build military aircraft here everyone wears an ID badge that is very easy to see and has your name and picture on it)\n\n&gt;$User: Fine, but its crashed now so I have to restart it again.\n\n&gt;$Zer0: It didn’t crash, it error message you are seeing clearly states that you didn’t enter the correct password. Just try typing it again.\n\n&gt;$User: No! It’s crashed and I have to restart it! \n\n&gt;$Zer0: No you don’t you just . . . \n\nAt this point she yanks the power cord out.\n\n&gt;$Zer0: Please don’t do that, it can damage the equipment.\n\nAt this point she just walked away so I continued on with my work until I got an email asking why I had restarted $User’s computer while she was working on it. Fortunately my boss knows that users lie and is dealing with it for me.\n\n",

That is not the problem!\n\nMe: But the wrong size.\n\nGF: what do you mean? We only have A4 (default letter size here)! And I printed as I allways do!\n\nMe: And why does the printer requests Legal?\n\nGf: It wanted paper, I gave him paper. What's wrong with it?\n\nMe: Yes, it wants Legal paper!\n\nGf: Why does it want legal paper? (noted that I haven't capitalized it now? She used the german word, while I allwas pronounced it english)\n\nMe: You know, what Legal is?\n\nGf: Yes, it's english for legal. Allowed, or what ever.\n\nThis was the moment it clicked.\nI had a brief look at her screen, while she was typing that letter. All the labels for the fields to fill in her adress were in english.\n\nI pointed at her desk.\n\nMe: May I?\n\nShe nodded with a glare of anger in her eyes.\n\nI got to the pageformatting and look there, the template was formatted as Legal.\nQuickly changed it to A4, while explaining was Legal is, hit print and the printer got to work.\n\nAnd all the adrenalin from this little yet harsh argumemt was put to a good use.",

The sun was beating in through the windows as my little desk fan lazily spun around making a squeak each pass. The air it moved offered only a tiny respite from the heat and boredome. It was the kind of day where all I could do was sit there and sweat while I waited for the next case to hit my desk. \n\nI reached into my desk and grabbed a bottle and a glass. Two ice cubes from my mini fridge go in and I pour myself a drink. As I was halfway through my liquid bliss a voice pierced the silence. \"Got one of those for me?\" The voice belonged Nancy, one of the ladies down the hall from accounting. The look on her face and the furrow in her brow told me all was not right in her world. \n\nI silently pulled another glass out and fixed her the same drink. \"Go ahead and take a seat. Tell me your troubles Nancy.\" \n\nNancy sat down on the other side and quickly gulped down her drink.  With the bottle at the ready, I poured her another glass of Mountain Dew. \"One more to calm your nerves.\" With her hand shaking she gulped this glass down too. \"Thanks. They say you are the best at finding things are lost.\" She said as her hands would not stop fidgeting. \n\n\"Well that depends on what went missing nancy. I am excellent at finding some things like password, but others like people or love I just have no luck in.\" I said in a sort of self depracating humor. \n\n\"Heh. Thanks. I sent a business associate an email two weeks ago from a loaner unit. For some reason no one is able to find these emails and they are not showing up in my sent list.\" As she spoke her hands shook and her voice started cracking. \n\nI reached into my pack and pulled out a stick of gum handing it to her. She quickly took it started chewing. The temporary relief provided by the gum did its job and allowed her to calm down. \"A few emails are nothing to lose your head over Nancy. There will always be more.\" I said as I poured myself another glass. \n\n\"I don't think you fully understand.  These emails are vital. I was working on a deal worth half a million and now things are going south. If I can't find these emails, I am done. You hear me? DONE!\" A small whistle escaped my lips. \"Well then I guess we better get started.\" I said as I grabbed my hat and coat. \"We better visit the loaner room and find the unit you were working on.\" I said as I held open the door to my office. \n\nThe lack of employees at their desks were a strange sight as we rounded the corner leading to the loaner clost. As we approached the loaner storage, I immediately knew something was amiss. Several people were gathered around the doorway with their faces all eager to see the carnage inside as they forced themselves onto the tips of their toes. This kind of crowd only gathers for one thing.   \n\nWe parted our way through the crowd to see three other techs staring at a dead laptop on the ground. \"What have we got here Bobby?\" I asked causing one of them to stand up and hand me the laptop. \"Its dead. Coffee spilled on the keyoard.\" Bobby said with his face clearly expressing displeasure. \"Folgers cofee by the smell of it\" I said taking a wiff. \"I see someone else enjoys the finer things in life.\" Bobby said in retort. \"Can't start my day without a good cup of Joe.\" \n\nI motion for nancy to come in. \"Is this the laptop you used to send the emails?\" I asked her flatly. \"Y-yes that is it. Can you recover them?\" She asked with an overly eager tone. The depseration in her voice and the sweat on her brow let everyone in the room know that she was scared. \"Well the Hard drive appears to be intact. Whoever tried to kill this laptop clearly did a poor job of it. All I have to do is swap hard drives and have you log in.\" I say causing her to smile with glee. \"Hey Bobby hand me another unit. I am going to try my hand at a simple swap for Nancy here.\" Bobby grimaced by understood that I would get a laptop one way or another and just handed me it. \"Bring it back in an hour you hear me. One hour.\" \n\nWith a wave of my hand acknowledging the request from Bobby, me and Nancy were off back to my office. Once we were back in I had Nancy hand me a small black case off of the desk. With all too much practice I removed the back of the laptop and unhooked the hard drive from the dead unit. \"We are in luck, the coffee did not make it this far back.\" I said as I swapped it into a working unit. \n\nI opened it up and started the machine telling Nancy to log in. She sat down on the other side of the desk from me and slowly but surely her smile faded into the same worried expression that she had when she first came to me. \"Th-they are not here!?\" She asked to no one and me at the same time. \"What do you mean Nancy? What's wrong?\" I asked trying to calm her down. \"The emails are not here... they have been deleted.\"",

        "text": "LTL-FTP, also fair warning, English isn't my first language, so please forgive any mistakes.\n\nBackground : My company does 3rd party IT support for all sorts of business, for this client we do mainly tier 1 and 2 and some on-site service calls at their retail stores (anything more, or if it's at their HQ, and it's their own IT that takes care of it). I do many things at my company, and that includes call center duties, so enough of explanations and onto this simple, yet funny (but tame) story!\n\nME = ... well, me!\n\nAM = Assistant Manager\n\n&gt;ME : \\**mandatory greeting and questions\\**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;AM : Hi, this is AM from store 123. Seems like the store email isn't working anymore!   \n&gt;  \n&gt;ME : No problem, what's the error you're getting?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;AM : Not getting any errors, but when I open it, it's not showing the email like usual...   \n&gt;  \n&gt;ME : Ok. What does it looks like now? (they use Outlook, so I'm expecting her to be in the calendar or something similar)   \n&gt;  \n&gt;AM : Well, like ... not like it's supposed to!   \n&gt;  \n&gt;ME : Right, so did you get an error when opening Outlook?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;AM : No, I'm going through the web portal!\n\nWhile they normally use Outlook, they also have the option to use a web portal. Practical if they are not on the manager's computer (like one of the retail computer in front) or on their phones.\n\n&gt;ME : Ah! I see, and where are you trying to connect from? One of the retail PC, or your phone?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;AM : No the manager's PC.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;ME : ...   \n&gt;  \n&gt;ME : You could use Outlook instead of the web portal.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;AM : Yes, but I prefer the web portal!\n\nFair enough, plus there might be a problem we need to fix and I have to confirm what the problem is. So there a bit of back and forth, to know when was the last time it worked, to try to understand what she sees, if she's entering the correct address (WEBPORTAL.STORE.COM) etc. But it's an older lady and she's extremely vague, she isn't helpful in her explanation and simply repeat that 'it used to work\" ...\n\nSo at this point I remote into the manager's PC to see what's up.\n\n&gt;ME : AH! I see the problem! You have to type the address in the top bar, not search for it in Google ...   \n&gt;  \n&gt;AM : Oh?\n\nSo yeah, she was SEARCHING for WEBPORTAL.STORE.COM, instead of typing it in the address bar (a quick look in the history showed she actually went to Google.com, and then searched).\n\nTook me less than a minute and she had a desktop shortcut and a favorite. I also explained to her that when she wants to go to a website (especially if she has the complete address), she has to type the address in the URL zone, not search it with Google, still unsure if she understood!\n\nThis is a tame story I know, but it's a funny one and still makes me laugh thinking about it, plus I have more stories, most not so funny and instead head desk worthy! ;)",

So I hope it will be understandable)\n\nLet's go !\n\nA tale about a disillusioned young IT tech, a twisted computer and an evil printer...\n\nThis story takes place a week ago... Last Monday. Somewhere in France.\n\nIn a small/medium size company, supplier in clothing for large retailers.\n\nThe IT desk is small. We are two (And soon only one. My contract should end in a few months.) :\n\nMe, a junior IT tech which is currently in is 15th month in this fantastic company with a temporary contract, and has been losing is sanity since my first day in this company.\n\nMy boss, friend of a friend (thats how I get the job), which have lose his sanity a year before I signed my contract. Not present in this story.\n\nLet's jump in.\n\nIt's monday, I am alone in IT lair.\n\nHopefully, most of the pests are on vacation. So everything is calm.\n\nNo angry user. No burning computer. Nothing.\n\nGreat ! Time for coffee !\n\n*\\*Fate decided it was not time for coffee\\**\n\nPhone is ringing.\n\nIt's shipment service.\n\nThey can't print on their computer.\n\nOk. Should be easy.\n\nQuick and easy.\n\nThis computer does not belong to my company. It's the property of a haulier. But well. It's just a printer problem. A printer that belong to us. So nothing to do with the haulier.\n\nI head to the desk and ask for the problem.\n\nSo... The problem is simple. They send documents to the printer in the warehouse office (which is located nearly 10 meters away) but nothing gets out.\n\nNo error message... Nothing.\n\nPrinter is shown online.\n\nI look at the printing queue and...\n\nNearly 50 print job in queue... Some have been sent 4 months ago !\n\nWith the mighty power of the right-click, I delete the queue and retry.\n\nStill nothing... Has expected.\n\nI just try to send a print job on another printer (which is also 10 meters away in the same office).\n\nIt works.\n\nSo maybe... The printer is faulty ?\n\nTurn the printer off and on again.\n\nSame for the computer.\n\nRetry.\n\nNothing.\n\nI try from another computer.\n\nWorks fine.\n\nSo... Should be the computer.\n\nLet's just reinstall the printer on it. Easy fix.\n\n...\n\nIf it was so easy, why would I wrote a TFTS story ?\n\nBut I didn't knew at this moment, that this computer was twisted.\n\nI delete the printer.\n\nRight-click, add new printer.\n\nI look on the list for the right one.\n\nIt appears twice. Crap.\n\nOh ! Nevermind. It's two differents printers. But it show me its MAC adress, so I can find the right one with this info.\n\nI head back to the printer. Print network setting.\n\nFound IPV6, head back to the computer.\n\nChoose the right one.\n\nExpect my coffee soon.\n\n&gt; Can't install the device.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; No driver found\n\nI sight.\n\nWell... I just need to download the drivers. Quick and easy.\n\nI download lastest the driver from manufacturer's website.\n\nExtract them.\n\nManual install.\n\n&gt;No driver found.\n\nWhat ?\n\nOk...

        "text": "Tl;dr has spoilers that I feel would detract from the long version, so it’s at the bottom. \n\nHey y’all, long time lurker, first time poster. I know most people in the subreddit are tech savvy, but I’ll still try to provide explanations on anything that might cause confusion to the average end user. \n\nI’ll provide some backstory real quick. I have a degree in Net/Sys Admin with an emphasis on Cisco Routing and Switching, plus I’m in the last year of my cybersec AAS. Not to mention several certs. I got hired on at an MSP as a Network Engineer a couple months ago. First part of this interaction is shortly after I started. \n\nM: me, female (one of 5 women in the entire company and only one on the tech side of things)\nC: End user who is the CEO of his company and is so computer illiterate it hurts\n\nA lot of our users are cloud based. C royally screwed up his company’s cloud based storage. It was throwing all sorts of errors, you couldn’t access or save documents. [product support] couldn’t even begin to guess what he had done. I’ll save you all the technical stuff. [product support] keeps escalating us to different departments, different tiers, different continents (joking...ish). It’s been about three weeks at this point that we’ve been working with them with no end in sight. \n\nC calls in. \n\nM: thank you for call [company], my name is [m].”\n\nC: give me [coworker]\n\nM: he’s out of town, is there something I can help you with?\n\nC, condescendingly: I don’t think you can sweetie. I need tech support. \n\nM: oh, that’s me! I’m the newest edition to the Help Desk. \n\nC, same tone: I need one of the men to handle it. I’ve been having issues for weeks with [product] and honestly one more person isn’t going to fix it. \n\nM: I can give you the most recent update from working with [product support] if you’ll let me pull it up. \n\nC, again being a punk: sweetheart, I doubt you can help me. Do you even have a tech degree? I’ll call later. \n\nAnd he ends the call and sends a particularly demeaning email to my CEO that my CEO forwarded onto our help desk team. \n\nFast forward to a few days ago. Our service coordinator has been delegating C’s issued to other engineers (5 of us total) after that, but today I was the only one available, so he transfers him to me.\n\nC calls in again with guess what! [product] issues. \n\nM, feeling dread: thank you for call [company] blah blah blah\n\nC, sheepishly: hi [m] I goofed, can you help me?\n\nM, remembering all my customer service rapport building tricks from the days were bad CSAT could get me fired even if it was out of my control: gladly, I’m so good at fixing goofs, they even pay me for it. \n\nC genuinely laughs and I remote into his computer, restore 30 documents he accidentally deleted and removed some adware that had been bothering him for weeks that he couldn’t figure out how to get rid of. \n\nDuring the time, I found out he’s a pretty decent guy, has a cabin a few miles from from the tiny mountain town I grew up in and he loves my Uncle’a cooking (owns a restaurant in said town). He’s just a d*ck when he’s stressed. Which not okay to take it out on me, but I get it, I’ve dealt with worse. I worked tech support for [satellite-tv company]. \n\nAfter the call, I popped into my CEO’s office to let him know that I’d gotten onto the right foot with him. I then learned that my CEO had responded to him letting him know that he needed to treat his employees with respect or we would be reconsidering our contract with him.\n\n\nTl;Dr: end user/CEO of a company we manage the IT for is a punk to me the first time for not being one of the men (I’m female) and not having a degree (I have one and another one I’m finishing after 6 more classes that I start on Monday). then my CEO whips him into shape and we build a decent relationship afterwards. \n\nEdit: CSAT is customer satisfaction. A worthless metric that doesn’t help call center agents succeed. You can get a bad CSAT survey because the sky is blue and the customer wants it to be green. \n\nEdit 2: AAS=associates of applied science. MSP=managed service provider (IT for multiple companies).

        "text": "I work at a large car dealership.\n\n\nA couple of days ago, a Pain In The Arse (Hereby known as PITA) was transferred to one of our smaller service centres, and the guy who was at this small service centre has been transferred to PITA’s dealership. Neither of them were happy about this, especially PITA.  He’s been complaining from day one.\n\n\nToday, the phone rang.  One look at the Caller ID, and my heart sinks.\n\nScoldog: “Hello, this is Scoldog speaking”\n\nPITA: “My EFTPOS machine doesn’t work”\n\nSD: “What?”\n\nPITA: “My EFTPOS machine doesn’t work.  It comes up with a connection error”\n\n\nAbout a year ago, all our branch EFTPOS machines were upgraded by the bank.  They all work on the mobile network, which is provided as part of the machine rental from the bank. There is no need for a phone line anymore like our older units.  The only thing the branch supplies is the power to run them.\n\n\nSD: “We don’t deal with EFTPOS machines.  You’ll need to speak to the bank.  Call Accounts if you have to”.\n\nPITA: “I’ve spoken to the bank, they reckon there’s something wrong with our network.”\n\nSD: “What?  These machines aren’t on our network, they don’t touch our network in anyway.  They use the mobile phone network and the bank looks after that.”\n\nPITA: “They say it’s something on our network stopping it from connecting”.\n\nSD: “That is impossible”\n\nPITA: “But its not connecting still.  There's a problem with our network!”\n\n\nWhatever, I work at Head Office with the Accounts Team, so I wandered over to the Accounts Manager to ask about this.\n\n\nSD: “Hey AM, can you look up the details for &lt;BRANCH&gt; EFTPOS machine?  PITA reckons it’s not working and the bank told him it’s our fault”\n\nAM: “What’s happening with it?”\n\nSD: “It’s coming up with a BLAHBLAHBLAH error.”\n\nAM: “&lt;OTHERBRANCH&gt; had that same error last week with their machine.  The bank had to replace it.”\n\n\nSD: “WTF?  Why did they tell him it was a problem on our side?”\nAM: “Dunno.  I’ll call him and get the machine details so I can call the bank”.\n\n\nAM calls PITA with me listening in the background.\n\n\nAM: “Hello, PITA?  What’s wrong with your EFTPOS machine? Uhuh, uhuh……uhuh…….uhuh, OK can you get the machine and read the following details”\n\n\nAM gets some information, hangs up and turns to me\n\n\nAM: “Apparently his machine hasn’t been working since yesterday. The bank got him to reset it yesterday afternoon, and that got it working again until he came in this morning. It’s gone bad again.  It’s the same issue &lt;OTHERBRANCH&gt; had last week.  I’ll organise the bank to get it replaced.\n\nSD:  “WHAT!”\n\nSo a bunch of clueless bank techs tell this guy that the issue is with our network somehow even though they should have known there is no connection between our infrastructure and their machine, and they’ve also experienced this same issue at our other branch.  PITA for some reason believed them even though he had it up and running after speaking to them the first time and wants to argue with me about our infrastructure. A bunch of people who deal with our money bugger up and a guy who is supposed to service cars who can’t seem to diagnose issues.\n\n\nIts days like this that I think I choose the wrong week to quit drinking^1\n\n\n1 – That’s not hyperbole, I did really quit drinking on Sunday.\n",

        "text": "TLDR:  A parts interpreter completely forgot her previous four years of experience with a particular program she uses daily\n\n\nI work a large car dealership\n\n\nWe have a large Parts Dept shipping millions of dollars of parts all over Australia daily.  Recently I’ve been upgrading some of the computers for the parts interpreters lately as their existing computers were getting sluggish (Windows bloat).  This has caused some teething issues (among which, trying to find a version of JRE that works with 15 different parts programs without issue.  Settled on Java 1.7_25.)\n\n\nAmong the other problems I’ve been having are all the different parts programs shopping lists. The parts program shopping list is exactly like a website shopping list, allowing you to build up a large amount of items.  In a parts program shopping list however, there is a button that exports all the selected items to our sales system, either via creating a file and importing it, or by entering the data directly into our sales system (depends on the manufacturer).\n\n\nAnyhoo, it’s after lunch on a Friday.  Read-Only time for the IT Dept.  I decided to go get a cuppa from the lunchroom.  On my way back to my desk, I was collared by one of the Parts Advisors that received an upgraded computer a couple of days ago.  Trying to work on the various issues on her computer has been trying due to her being too busy most of the time to be able to sit down with me and show me the issues she was having.  I’d look at her computer after she leaves for the day and everything would be fine.\n\n\nParts Advisor: “Scoldog, I’ve got an issue with &amp;lt;BRAND&gt; Parts program.\n\nScoldog: “What’s happening?”\n\nPA: “It doesn’t transfer the quantities”\n\nSD: “What, no data is getting into our sales system?”\n\nPA: “No, the parts get imported, it’s just not transferring the amounts correctly.  It only transfers one of each”\n\n\nOK, this is bizarre, if there is a fault with the transfer side of things, usually no data would get transferred.  I’ve never heard of any of them transferring incorrect data.\n\n\nSD: “OK, show me”.\n\n\nPA selects a VIN that she was previously looking up.  She had to pick out a bumper bar.  With these parts programs, they normally flag all parts that would be required for fitting a particular item.  For instance, this bumper bar requires 12 screws as well to be fitted correctly.  The person fitting it may desire to reuse the screws from the old bumper and may not require the extra parts.  The parts program automatically flags the part number for those screws in the shopping list, but not the quantity needed.  It’s up to the advisor to enter in the quantity, or zero them out as required.\n\n\nPA:  “Ok, so I’ve selected this bumper bar, there are all the parts, and LOOK! The sales system has only imported 1 of every item!”\n\n\nI look at the parts program shopping list, every item selected in the parts program list has a 1 in the Quantity field.\n\n\nSD: “You’ve only selected 1 of each item in the shopping list.  Look there at the Qty field.”\n\nPA: “No, that’s not correct.  It should automatically calculate how many screws I need for this bumper.”\n\nSD:  “Why would it do that?”\n\nPA: “Look over here.” *points to 'Qty required' field* “It says I need 12, and it should automatically put 12 in the Qty field”\n\nSD: “Sorry, I don’t think that is the way it works.  It might say 12 screws are required, but it only puts 1 in the Qty field.  You will need to modify the Qty yourself.”\n\nPA: “But it used to!”\n\nSD: “What?”\n\nPA: “It used to automatically enter the amount needed in the old program”\n\nThe parts program she is currently using is the exact same version she was using on her old computer.  Installed from the same DVD.  She’s used this same program for the four years it’s been since she has started with the company.\n\nSD: “To be honest, that doesn’t sound right.  How does the program know exactly how many you may or may not need?”\n\nPA: “But &amp;lt;TOPBLOKE&gt; computer automatically does it!”\n\n&amp;lt;TOPBLOKE&gt; is another parts interpreter in Parts.  He normally helps IT out by fielding some of the questions his colleagues have, and knows when to approach IT.  If he says there is a problem, there is a guaranteed problem that needs fixing.  He doesn’t have an upgraded computer yet either. His desk is on the North side of the office, PA is on the South Side.  It’s a running joke amongst the Northerners in Parts  that the South Side is Special.\n\nSD: “TB is running the exact same program you are running and the exact same version.  It should work the same for all off you.”\n\nPA: “OK, I’ll show you.”\n\nShe emails the car VIN over to TB with the associated part numbers she needs to pick.  I follow PA over to TB’s desk.\n\nPA: “TB, can you look up that VIN that I emailed you and pick the parts I requested”\n\nTB: “Sure”\n\nSD: “Do you mind explaining to me each step as you do it?\"\n\nTB: “Yeah, no problems”\n\n\nTB loads up his parts program, and away he goes\n\n\nTB:  “Ok, so you are after this bumper bar.  Ok, so I select the bumper bar there, there’s the associated parts, then I change the Qty of the screws to 12 and transfer it to the sales system, and all done!”\n\nSD: “Ok, so when you first select the parts, the parts quantities are all set to 1 in your parts program”\n\nTB: “Yes”\n\nSD: “And you manually change the quantities you need in the quantity field”\n\nTB: “Yes, or I delete or zero it out as needed.  That’s the way it’s always worked.\n\nPA: “…………Oh”\n\nPA wanders back to her desk in a haze of bewilderment.\n\nSD: “Thanks TB”\n\nTB: “No worries Scoldog.  You know I don’t mind helping you out with those South Siders whenever they need help!”\n\n\nGuess who's on IT's Nice List come Christmas Time!\n",

        "text": "About 3 years ago I used to work at the tech department for a customer support provider. Our client was a budget ISP, so you know what's up. Besides customer support, I also worked a few hours in the week as QM. My colleague (let's call him Burt) e-mailed me that I have to listen to the call he is having right now with a customer, Miss $ladypants.\n\nTen minutes later I see that he is done with the call. I download the recorded interaction which also contains a screenrecording of Burt's desktop, so I also could see what he was doing during the call. The call was not in English so I translated as accurate as I could, and I kinda covered the strong language.\n\nBurt: Good afternoon and welcome to $client, my name is Burt, how can I help you?\n\n$ladypants: Ya hi you need to fix my wifi, it just stopped working on all my devices! This is the 2,147,483,647th time this week!\n\nBurt (loading the customer data): That sounds like quite the problem ma'am, on all your devices you say?\n\n$ladypants: Ya but I still have TV.\n\nBurt: Indeed, I can see that your internet still works, so it seems to be just the wifi.\n\nBurt follows the regular troubleshoot which takes a few minutes, but $ladypants becomes unpatient quickly and starts to scold Burt.\n\n$ladypants: Why does this take so long, is this your first day or something?\n\nBurt: No ma'am, but not all problems can be fixed quickly.\n\n$ladypants: I don't have time for this bs, can you transfer me to someone who actually knows his shit?\n\nAt this moment is Burt audibly getting pissed. I see him opening up his workmail and sending me the actual message as I think to myself: Burt you baldy motherducker you...\n\nBurt: I'm sorry Miss $ladypants, but you'll have to deal with me. Let's just focus on the problem, OK?\n\n$ladypants (starts screaming): NO! I'm done with you! All of you! I want to cancel my whole package, you hear!? Right now!\n\nBurt: Are you sure? I think it's better if you-\n\n$ladypants: No! I don't want to hear anymore excuses! For the second time, cancel it!\n\nBurt: Okidoki ma'am this will take only a minute, I'll be right back.\n\nBurt (calls to $admin in the backoffice): Hi $admin, Miss $ladypants would like to immediately cancel her complete subscription.\n\n$admin: Uhm.. Is she sure about that, buddy?\n\nBurt: Yes, I asked her specifically (he didn't lie)\n\n$admin: Allrighty then, the order is first in the list so that is... done! All the services are terminated, the final bill for this month will be recalculated around $somedate.\n\nBurt: Cool, thanks.\n\nBurt (goes back to $ladypants): Thank you for waiting miss $ladypants, I ha-\n\n$ladypants: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE MY TV STOPPED WORKING!\n\nBurt: Well, that's because you have canceled your subscription, so the services stop too.\n\n$ladypants: WTF I DIDN'T MEAN THAT?! You know what I'm gonna file the biggest complaint you've ever seen! Give me your name and transfer me to your complaint department!\n\nBurt: I'm very sorry ma'am, but if you want to do that you will have to become a customer first.\n\n$ladypants: ...\n\nBurt: ... can I do anything else to help you with?\n\n$ladypants: DUCK YOU YOU PIECE OF SHIT \\*click\\*\n\nAnd the recording ends there. Burt has never heard about her again, she went to a different ISP.\n\nThis was my first story to share here, hope you enjoyed. I have a few more about my time there that I can share.",

I had interned with said company and had a decent networking knowledge and was reasonably comfortable with both IOS and CatOS. Got given a task to upgrade some older 6500s from CatOS to IOS. \n\nTheres a lesson here involving change control that was learned, but thats another story entirely. But regardless, one night got a partner in crime to assist and went at. \n\nBoot statements missing or un-resolvable on any cisco devices will default to a set of behavior. That behavior is actually quite predictable if well understood. The problem with one of these boxes is it had internal linecards, external linecards, and some really old bootrom that also had code on  it...\n\nStarting out, I wiped the internal, had partner insert external with the IOS image. Little did I know about the internal bootrom...\n\nTo really set the scene, this switch was effectively a downstream access switch with a single uplink to 2 paired core devices. In my defense, we also found the config was wrong on the core switches, as effectively spanning tree was not enabled for these ports. \n\nSo when we rebooted the device, I had not set a new bootstatement. First default boot location is that bootrom. Which happened to have another CatOS image. \n\nSo my big problem, CatOS when it boots, has all ports open by default. Bad for security but great for \"it just works\" Cisco default switching. IOS doesnt do this any more (didnt then either); ports boot closed by default. \n\nSo while Im cursing and my partner is laughing that the IOS didnt boot, his phone is ringing... Its the NOC, wondering why the whole datacenter is down...\n\nNeedless to say, got some very good lessons and memory refreshers out of this fun, and got away scott free. Probably wouldnt today, but some good booze at the end of the night cures all ills. ",

We had already discussed and provisioned some 4 or so networks from our layer 3 switch for internal data, staff wireless, guest, phones, etc.\n\nSome time after the internet and switching was setup we got a call to schedule a discussion with this other 3rd party company to discuss their wireless configuration. As the call begins the tech on the line introduces himself as Chuck Norris. My supervisor doesn't notice it right away and we keep discussing going over the different SSIDs they would want to configure and all for their needs. Nearing the end of the call my supervisor asks for his contact info and goes to write down his email and the guy renames himself, to which he gets a reply \"Wait are you shitting me, your name is Chuck Norris?\" And indeed it was.\n\nOver the next few days we regularly make jokes about kicking patch cables into place and printing images of the real Chuck Norris to leave around the office thinking its all in great fun. Then the day they are supposed to deploy their wireless arrives and things quickly turn south.\n\nChuck Norris calls our newest employee to ask us what IPs to use and where to plugin his generic cheap switch/wireless controller by some brand I don't even recognize. They get that squared away and the switch added to the admin network and the call ends. Will he kick the APs directly into the ceiling to mount them? Deployment begins.\n\nSometime later he calls back saying his APs are plugged in and they aren't getting addresses. Well, they are on the admin network and we aren't controlling wireless so we have no DHCP scope setup, but we go ahead and add one for the subnet and ask if he needs a hex option or anything for the controller. \"No I've never needed anything of the sort it just works as is.\" Okay then, and away he goes into the sunset.\n\nA little while later he calls back again. The wireless is setup now, but the clients that connect don't work. Really? Well all the wired clients and DHCP scopes are setup so it should work fine? Turns out the users aren't getting DNS so they aren't getting anywhere. Because the clients are getting DHCP on the admin vlan instead of one of the client ones.\n\nWell Chuck, you need to setup the SSIDs to match to the correct vlans so that clients in each network get placed onto the correct subnets. \"What do you mean vlans? We just setup the SSIDs and then clients connect and everything works.\" It turns out they have apparently been setting up wireless networks for people with all the SSIDs always just sitting on a flat single data network and no separation.\n\nWe investigate further and screen share with him to look at this controller switch, and figure out where to go to apply vlans to SSIDs and ports. There is a catch though, we can't. The AP model they had speced and installed does not even support vlans. (On a side note, they also had 5ghz radios disabled because \"They don't need that.\")\n\nSo we discuss it a bit more and they don't really have any option, so we change the handoff port to their switch to the data network, they change its management IP and put all the SSIDs (just PSKs, no user auth or anything, plus the open guest network) on the same subnet.\n\nAll of our hype and jokes lead to nothing but great disappointment and a glorious Chuck Norris network was never to be had. From what I heard he didn't even kick anything.\n\nA week or two later we get a call from the client requesting how much a wireless quote would be and if we could get things setup correctly so staff have to login as users and guest would correctly be separated and all. Within a month everything was moved over and all signs of the previous system erased. Chuck Norris nothing but a fondly painful memory.",

        "text": "Sometimes the story is not about the user being dumb... it's about the tech being dumb... \n\nI had been working for City Hall providing Helpdesk support for some time. One of the Helpdesk had gotten a promotion and I was picked to take over some of her duties. Specifically, I was asked to start spending half days at City Court to provide Helpdesk services there. \n\nI spent a week or so shadowing the other technician to get to know some of the people and get a feel for the problems they might have. On my second or third day on my own, one of my users tells me that her computer won't power on. I go over to take a look and ask the user ( an older woman ) where her computer was. She promptly points at the monitor on her desk. I immediately have flashbacks to working at the bank and think \"Oh no, not again...\". I am looking on her large and crowded desk, under her desk, behind her desk, etc. for the tower. The user is watching me, and finally asks me what I'm doing. I tell her that I'm looking for the computer. She gets a funny look on her face and points at her monitor again. I'm about to tell the user that that's NOT her computer when I look over and realize that it's an all-in-one. I'm very embarrassed and now the user looks like she's ready to kick me out of her office. I pull the power cable and hit the power button a few times, plug the cable back in, and power the machine up much to the relief of the user. \n\nTL;DR: Users aren't always completely ignorant. Sometimes you need to stop and listen. \n\n\\--\n\nIt's a twofor! So, back in 2002 or so... I was in the office for a few days and was helping out one of our electronics techs. He was tasked with putting together about 30 new offshore PC's. Our company used MOSTLY in house built PC's. He and I were both very familiar with building PC's and had each probably built over 100. So, we assemble these 30 machines and when we go to power them up to install the OS.... only 8 of them power up. Now, these 8 weren't all the ones he built nor all the ones I built. They were randomly distributed. We double check the cabling from the power supply to the motherboard, from the power switch to the motherboard, verify that the outlet has power... we are completely stumped. There's no way we got 22/30 motherboards that are DOA... \n\nWhile we are unplugging and replugging power cables, we \\*FINALLY\\* noticed that there was ALSO a power switch on the back of the power supply in addition to the front panel power switch. 22 out of 30 of the power supplies had that switch in the OFF position. We both felt like idiots... Prior to that, neither of us had run across a power supply that had a separate power switch. ",

How did you do it? Did you properly burn the file to DVD?  \n&gt;$gf (shouting from another room): I think so, but i can show you how i did it - i followed instructions for (reading out loud) \"creating a bootable Windows Installation Disk\"  \n\n$Ygg came over, and sure enough her process seemed legit, she selected the right partition scheme, file system etc.  \n\n&gt;$gf: Is $newlaptop already broken? Do i have to send it back? I dont want to work on my old potato anymore, and i cant run half the $demandingsoftware i need   \n&gt;$Ygg (impressed by $gf's sudden spurt of tech-savvyness): Hrmmm...no i don't think so...but i'll see if i can boot up the DVD on my PC...  \n\n$Ygg actually had to plug a CD/DVD Drive in his PC first, since he had not used CDs in ages, but once that was done he saw, that he as well was unable to boot from the DVD.\nDeciding to just create a bootable flash drive on his own, he launched his own *working* version of windows and after logging in, noticed a notification about a new external device connected to the PC\nInterested in the contents of the DVD $Ygg opened to drive to see the files contained.\n\n$Ygg blinked a few times and pushed his face closer to the monitor as he did a double take to look at the single file contained on the DVD.\n\n    7zip.exe\n\t\nFor a few seconds $Ygg just stared at the screen, then broke out in loud laughter - ultimately attracting $gf's attention.\n\nAs it turned out, when accessing the university softwareportal she downloaded \"7zip for Windows\" mistaking it for the actual windows installation.  \nUsing the softwareportal himself later, $Ygg couldnt really blame $gf for that mistake - all entires were deeply nested and recommended Software (like 7zip)\npopped up in large Panels everywhere, pushing the software you actually clicked on to the very bottom of the page.\n\nIn the end we were able to get everything running smoothly, including ~~$Ygg's Games for LAN~~ $demandingsoftware.\nUntil one day a single Windows 10 Update snuck through during exam season, but that is another story.\n\nEdited for grammar and formatting\n\n\n\n\n",

The way our web app works is that it makes a preview of the labels and allows to print the rendered html/css directly, so all positioning is html css. That in itself is a bit of a pain.\n\nYesterday i got assigned a ticket to add the labels for the only version of the product that doesn't share the same labels as the others to the app. You basically have to paste the whole sheet on the product and then you can break the pieces as you need it.\n\nBeing told the dimensions were on our (rarely updated) confluence, i go on my merry way. Except that when i'm done, and ask @PM an existing version of the labels to confirm it matches, IT DOESN'T. BY A LOT.\n\nOur conclusion : confluence is screwed up, again.\n\nFast forward to today, nothing else can be found so I start hand mesuring the existing to make it match. After a painful process of translating cm in px and a still inaccurate result, with a brief interlude offering my kitten's blood to the printer because jammed paper broke it causing it to autojam new paper, @PM goes :\n\n&gt; I remember the old specs were screwed up, @(other guy that broke his leg badly and haven't been here since 6 months) had to do a lot of hand tweaking to make it work\n\n*SCREAMS INTERNALLY*\n\n&gt; Would a sample of product before the labels are put help you match it?\n\n**SCREAMS LOUDER**\n\n&gt; (soft-spoken) yes please\n\nAfter testing my last prints, comprehension comes to me, and I check original. IT BARELY MATCHES and same parts are actually not exactly the same making it all crooked up.\n\nI test my first version, it fits perfectly. Turns out confluence was right all along, and we had been selling a 'fix'.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Don't base your work on existing and sold product without making sure the product is actually good.",

They already spoken to a few tech-savy friends, family members and even went to the genius bar of the manufacturer. No-one could solve the issue and the \"genius\" told her to arrange a replace but since it wasn't bought in their store she had to go to the store she bought it and ask a new phone based upon warranty.\n\nShe received the phone for her birthday a few months ago and still hadn't time to go to that shop with her father (contract was on his name so he had to be present for that).\n\nSince her initial issue was so basic I didn't really looked at the phone but just went through the settings and now it made me look closer at the phone. I already noticed she had a screenprotector but now looking better at it I saw that instead of using a new one she cut of the lower part of the original screenprotector.\n\nAnd as some of you might already envision.....the screenprotector went over the screen into the back. Covering the earpiece. So I took it off and asked her to call her friend and listen how she sounded. Her eyes grew in disbelief that no-one noticed this before and me and her friend start laughing about the \"genius\" who should've noticed it in the first place.",

        "text": "So this is a tale from very early in my offshore career ( around 1996 or 1997 ). I did not yet have a passport, nor had I ever been outside of the US. We are preparing for a job that will start in Mexico and end in Peru. I'm asked to go to the r/V Oh Shucks ( not its real name ) and oversee the installation of a satellite phone which would provide voice and data services while the boat is overseas. At the time, I was more or less completely unfamiliar with satellite communications, but I was very comfortable with using cell phones ( bag phones ) for data using Telebit Worldblazers...\n\nSo, I go to the ship and watch an installer set up the radome, sat phone, and associate peripherals. We configure the sat phone to talk to the correct LES and make a few test calls. Then, I am tasked with dialing into one of the modems at the home office, establishing a connection and setting up UUCP on the boat to transfer email. All goes swimmingly, I get a little overtime, and I go home.\n\nI get a call about a week later saying that the sat phone is not working. I also get the news that I'm about to take my first trip outside the US. Have I mentioned that I really knew next to nothing about satellite phones at this time?\n\nSo... the project manager and I fly out to Cozumel to meet the boat in ?Puente Morales?. I get to the boat, and the sat phone is up, but not getting any signal. I check things out as best I can, but everything looks fine. I pore over the manuals for a while, discovering nothing useful. I call up the vendor and tell them that I'm not getting any signal even when I manually enter coordinates. The connections to the GPS and ship gyro are all plugged in and working. They send out a tech that we'll call Mario. Mario is a Mexican satellite technician.\n\nThe first hurdle, upon meeting Mario, is that Mario doesn't speak ANY English. I don't speak ANY Spanish. Our communication devolves to pointing to various parts of the manual and shrugging at each other. After watching Mario run through all the same checks that I did, a tiny spark of inspiration strikes. I know that the antenna cable is hooked up to the sat phone... but what about the other end? So, I climb up a ladder, ignore all the dire radiation warnings, figure out how to open the radome, and stand up inside. One very important thing mentioned in the manual is that the stabilization gyroscopes \\*MUST\\* be running in order to be able to keep on target with the satellite of choice. Those gyroscopes are not running. In fact, there is not even a power connection for them.\n\nSo, I go downstairs to attempt to inform Mario of what I've found. After much pointing and gesticulation, Mario writes on a piece of paper that he can read and write English, he just can't speak it. \\*smacks forehead\\* WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO! So, I eventually get across to him that there is no power to the stabilizers and that they need 220 power to run. At this point, Mario looks at me and asks in all seriousness  \"Yes.... but 220 A/C or D/C?\"\n\n\\*\\*GET OFF MY BOAT!\\*\\*\n\nI kicked Mario off the boat and immediately called our satellite rep. I explained the situation and they apologized and flew an installer down from Houston to fix the problem.\n\nThe installer couldn't believe that Mario had asked me that question and we had a good laugh over it. We established communications again, the turned the boat 180 degrees to verify that we were tracking the satellite... then I was allowed to fly home.\n\nETA: I think some people are rather missing the point. First, as the \"expert\" send down by the sat phone company, knowing whether the stabilizers ran on AC or DC seems like pretty fundamental information. Second, if the motors ran on 220VDC, it seems like the expert would know that the system came with a rectifier ( 220VDC is not something you would reasonably expect every boat to have ). Third, the manual VERY clearly stated 220VAC. All of these in concert destroyed every last shred of confidence I had in this guy as an \"expert\", which is how he was described to me. Lastly, this would be akin to calling your car dealership about some problems with your brand new Corvette and being told that your car would be taken care of by their Corvette EXPERT... who after looking at your car for an hour asks you whether it runs on diesel or gasoline....",

He then tested the network cable from the printer to the local switch with the current cable, and a known-good cable from another printer that was fully functional. The first cable was indeed bad, and he said they'll get another one. He then apologized again for wasting my time, but I assured him it was quite alright.\n\nUsually reataurant people are a mixed bag when it comes to computer stuff, to put it lightly, but there are a couple gems to be found there too.",

        "text": "Hi I'm /u/intelminer. You may remember me from such TFTS classics as ***[The customer who did not want a tech](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3op1yo/the_customer_who_did_not_want_a_tech/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage)*** and [***Grow up and fix it yourself***](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1bkoq0/grow_up_and_fix_it_yourself/)\n\nToday though I'm here to talk about ***field technicians***. The ones that come into your home to install things or fix things!...in theory\n\nSo. A little background to this story. The VERY LARGE CABLE COMPANY I worked for used to have a system where field techs would have to call an outsourcing company every time they needed something altered or something was broken or anything else they couldn't \"do\" on their own\n\nUnsurprisingly, these outsourcers were ***god awful*** and never did their jobs. Oh and there was a different one for every single state, so all the training manuals, procedures etc were different for every state. And there's something like 30+ states serviced. Absolutely ***perfect***\n\nSo eventually they took an entire building and reassigned about 250 of us to handle being this brand new department. Basically a \"Tier 2 support line\" for field techs\n\nField techs and contractors immediately abused our new department with absolute gleeful malice. This is the first in a likely long line of stories about these things happening\n\n____\n\n\nWe start this story, as all great stories do, with me receiving a phone call. A contractor down in Texas was on a job. He was to \n\n1. Install a cable box for the customer\n\n2. Upgrade their old DOCSIS 2 modem to a brand new all in one modem/router combo \n\nSo far so simple. The contractor had installed and provisioned the new modem and the signal levels were excellent. He probably just needs something like the box serial number added to the account. Easy \n\nHis problem however (or so he claimed) was that the customer \"wouldn't let him\" run a new cable line to the living room for their cable TV! \n\n\"Oh boy, I know where this is going\" I winced internally\n\nImmediately, as contractors so often do. He asks if I will speak to the customer and \"explain\" why this is needed. I politely, but firmly, inform him that we ***do not speak to customers under any circumstances***. \n\nUndeterred by this, he puts his work phone down, putting me on speaker. He then pulls out his backup work phone, dials the customer and puts her on speaker phone. Putting both phones on the table side by side!\n\nI quickly repeated my statement that we do not speak to customers, requested to be taken off speaker phone and muted my microphone. I then proceeded to listen to the customer and the contractor debate the issue.\n\n\nAs it turns out. The customer already ***had*** a cable outlet in that location. They previously had Satellite TV (DirecTV/Dish/Whomever). All the contractor would have to do is cut the cable outside and patch it into the existing line from us!\n\nShe knew this, the contractor knew this, and he could not formulate a convincing argument to convince her otherwise.\n\n\n\n___\n\nI should probably mention that contractors for VERY LARGE CABLE COMPANY earn commission on certain kinds of work done. In this case, if the installer ran a new cable line. He would have earned $15. The customer would be charged $70 however. And this was a fee that could not be waived (without the customer later calling and kicking up a huge fuss)\n\n___\n\n\nThe customer eventually cut the contractor off, firmly requesting that he \"leave the property\". At this point, I snapped out of listening with bemusement as the incompetent contractor fumbled for an excuse to steal money from us and the customer and realized ***he was at the customers home, alone and unsupervised to do this work***. That was strike two, and if he were a direct field technician instead of a contractor, would have been grounds for immediate on the spot termination of employment \n\nAfter the customer requested the contractor leave and then hung up. The contractor calmly picked his phone back up and asked me if I would \"force close\" the job. Essentially marking all work as completed without any testing and letting him pick up a paycheck and move on to his next job\n\nI reiterated that he was to install the cable box, and reaffirmed the customers point that the existing cable wiring could be used\n\nThe contractor instead asked to have the job \"taken off him\". Which would have put the job into limbo until the customer called and had another technician or contractor scheduled. ***Not going to happen***\n\nThe field contractor sighed and quietly folded, agreeing to do what was expected of him\n\n\nFast forward to near the end of my shift. I'm typing up a report on the contractor. For (in order)\n\n1. Lying to the customer in an attempt to inflate his commission payout\n\n2. Being in a customers home when nobody else was present\n\n3. Attempting to avoid doing the work he was assigned, while still being paid for it\n\nAny one of these things is pretty much grounds for termination for regular employees, let alone contractors\n\nBut this contractor wasn't done. Oh no, he had other ideas! Looking over on the account, I noticed a few things\n\n- The contractors job was still open. The job was assigned to his technician ID, and it was well past its completion time (the job was scheduled for something like 8AM to 10AM, it was now roughly 7:30 PM there)\n\n- There was no cable box present on the account. I guess he didn't install it after all...?\n\n- The customer had contacted us, and spoken to several representatives a few hours later\n\n\nAs it turned out. After hanging up the phone with me, the contractor proceeded to undo all the work he had already done. He took the already installed and active modem, and simply ***left***. He couldn't remove the modem from the customer's account, but he physically took it with him after leaving.\n\nThe customer had come home from work later that day, only to find a cable wire hanging over some table, and both their old and new modems simply ***GONE***\n\n\nThe customer had a new appointment scheduled shortly after, one with an in-house field technician rather than a contractor. I don't know if the contractor was ever fired, or if he was simply brushed off, still out there making mistakes left and right, all over Texas",

        "text": "A long time ago my company took on a new client, a sister company to an existing client who after hearing that we got to the bottom of of some networking issues wanted us to come in and do the same.\n\nDuring our first year with them, we upgraded their mail server and file server. They very much enjoyed not having exchange information stores dismounting on a regular basis. They also enjoyed the install of ExtremeZ-IP so the mac users could access the shares on the windows server with ease and they were especially grateful that we took the time to re-label their patch cabinet which had been put in by rank amateurs as the label on the patch panel had absolutely nothing to do with the port number out on the office floor, which finally enabled us to make sure all the OSX machines were on gigabit ethernet as opposed to the 100mb ports most were on to access their 600MB+ image files. All in all things were running smoothly. the only issue we ever had was that they were a 90 minute drive away from us on a good day when they needed on site skills.\n\nThen they got a new phone system. My company does phone systems, but they didn't go with us or even let us know they were looking. We found out when we got the out of hours call.\n\n$PI = phone idiot\n\n$Me = podgerama\n\n$client = the client\n\n$PI: Hi, i'm doing some work on the phone system at $client, there's something wrong with your network, it doesnt work properly.\n\n$Me: Pardon?\n\n$PI: Yeah the phones aren't getting IP addresses, there is something wrong on your network mate!\n\n$Me: Sorry, who are you and what work are you doing?\n\n$PI: I work for (can't remember company name) and we are replacing their old Avaya phone system with a new Mitel one this weekend, but i've plugged all my kit in place and nothing gets an IP and now none of the computers which go into the back of the new phones get out to the internet. and now, all the computers that were plugged direct in to the walls don't even get an address.\n\n$Me: okay, i was totally unaware of this work going on, and the last time i did some work on their network was on Wednesday and everything was connected and i had access to all VLAN's\n\n$PI: well mate, somethings gone wrong and I cant complete my work until your lot fix this.\n\n$Me: \\*checks monitoring system\\* OK, i can see everything was up and working until 10:30 this morning, have you changed anything apart from the phone system?\n\n$PI: no mate, i just started the install around then.\n\n$Me: O.K. can you do a check for me, in the rack there should be a 48 Port HP Procurve switch, what are the lights doing on there.\n\n$PI: That's doing nothing, I've replaced it with a Cisco!\n\n$Me: Pardon? errm, what?\n\n$PI: yes mate, replaced it with a better switch, this one's a Cisco.\n\n(he gave the model number, it wasn't even a catalyst, it was a horrible budget re-branded Linksys)\n\n$Me: And there is your fault, what you have done is remove the core switch, with the VLAN's configured on it and replaced it with an unconfigured switch. Do you even know the VLAN ID's that were supposed to be programmed onto that?\n\n$PI: What's a VLAN? anyway, this shouldn't be a problem, its a Cisco Switch, they just work!\n\n$Me: excuse me? could you repeat that?\n\n$PI: its a Cisco, they just work!\n\n$Me: No, the bit before that!\n\n$PI: what?\n\n$Me: the part where you asked what a VLAN was?\n\n$PI: I don't need to know about those, the Cisco switch can do all of that!\n\n$Me: So you are telling me you have replaced the fully configured HP procurve switch, which has ports configured with LACP for extra server bandwidth, and VLAN trunks to separate the phone and data networks with a re-branded Linksys and you are wondering why there is no network connectivity.\n\n$PI: I don't normally have to do any switch config because these Cisco's just work.\n\n$Me: listen, mate, you have clearly just walked and started messing with a network that is well above your pay grade. If you don't know or understand what a VLAN is then you don't have the required knowledge to be reconfiguring this network.\n\n$PI: so what do i do, i told them i would only be an hour and its been three.\n\n$Me: you abandon your install, you give me your email address, i send you a photo of the HP switch as it was two weeks ago and my excel spreadsheet of what cable was plugged in where and you plug that all back in as it was before you started at 10:30 this morning. Because of this conversation the call status has changed from out of hours emergency fix to Chargeable out of hours engineering, the bill for this is £250/hour so i don't think you are going to want me to be online for much longer.\n\n$PI: so what do i tell the client?\n\n$Me: i've already started mailing them and i'm attaching this call recording. This was the first my company has heard of the job and your company has not made any contact with us before about this to arrange out of hours support, and from our conversation someone with the requisite skill set was not sent. I would suggest you inform them that the network is more complex than you initially thought and further contact with my company is required to be able to preconfigure your equipment so this job can work.\n\n$PI: err, ok, err, thanks\n\nAnyway. he gets the original stuff patched back in and we hear nothing from them. They sent someone with more of a brain two weeks later who used the network diagram we provided to the client to work things out. I say a bit more of a brain, but not a genius. We got calls from the client the next week after the phone installs, all the Macs in the design department were running slowly and it must be our fault. After a support call to us it turned out the phone boys had patched them into the back of the new phones taking them down to 100mb connections. I proved this by showing the status page of the HP switch now with only 1/4 of its ports active.\n\nThe client called the phone people out to re-patch\n\nThe phone people patched them directly into wall sockets to the horrible Linksys/Cisco and charged the client for doing so.\n\nThe macs showed 1Gb connecetions but were still slow over the network, the phone people said it was our problem. much back and forth later with the client getting more pissed off and the phone people blaming our network i decided to pop in.\n\nThe answer was staring me in the face with a big orange light. they had configured the port used to link the Cisco/Linksys into the HP as 100mb. I showed them by plugging my laptop into the HP - 1000mb, then into the Linksys - 100mb. which turned all of this from free of charge break fix engineering into chargeable work.\n\nThe last i heard the client were tearing the phone company a new one for their incompetence, lack of understanding, for the amount of time wasted by the design department and for the £2K of billing from my company to fix their mistakes.\n\nTL;DR - idiot with no networking knowldge and a big bag full of assumptions breaks network after thinking Cisco label will make everything magically work\n\nEDIT: as rightly pointed out, i got confused between two cheap and nasty brands, it was Linksys not DLink who Cisco purchased and used as a cheap brand and then ditched.

So I am hangry and frustrated but I will finally have answers. \n\nMe: Myself\n\nClueless: The Antagonist. \n\nMe:\"So I was reviewing the application and couldn't find this shared email box in the application.\"\n\nClueless: \"We need to change the Email movement rule on the shared email.\"\n\nMe: \"Then why did you send me this document?\"\n\nClueless: \"This email box was created by this project and your former boss.\"\n\nMe: \"Ok, I will email you the instructions on how to change the rules in a share email box.\"\n\nClueless:  \"I don't have to time to do your work, you just fix it.\"\n\nMe:\"I am not the helpdesk, I do application development.  But I do know how to fix this.  Just login to the Web Outlook.\"\n\nClueless: \"What is that?'\n\nMe: \"Just let me use your computer, I don't have access to the shared email box.\"\n\nI pull open the outlook webmail and use it to open the shared email box directly.  That lets me access the rules for the box and there is a single one in it.  It moves anything with two strings to a \"DO NOT PROCESS\" folder. But the requirements for the rules and the content of the rules disagress, after doing a little searching around in the DO NOT PROCESS box. Page 39 of 128 states that error type 1,2 and 3 should be not processed so the rule moves all \"error type\" to the ignore folder.  But there are error types 4 and 5 in it. \n\nI point this out to her and I am thrown out of the office as she says my services are no longer needed and she can handle it all herself. \n\nHopefully I don't have to both with this again.  But I doubt it.",

She got some cheap smartphone to be \"hip\" or something, and of course, she had to call tech support to learn how to set the thing up.\n\nI was at a big family meetup with her and she was telling the story about how she called tech support and that she felt bad because she couldn't get the thing working because it was frozen. Apparently, no matter what the operator told her to do, nothing was happening on the phone. \n\nShe gives it to me to fix since I'm young and understand technology, and I go into another room thinking that this is going to be some severe issue that I will have to focus and spend a lot of time on. Before this point, I had only glanced briefly at the phone, but now as I looked directly at it, I realized something looked really off: the protective fake screen protector thing was still on the phone. It was one of those ones with a fake home screen printed onto it to make it look like it was running.\n\nI went back to where my family was all gathered and they asked if I had fixed it. I simply set it on the table and peeled off the screen protector. Everyone had a good laugh about that one.",

So, back to my time offshore...\n\nMultibeam operators were required to note the weather conditions in a paper log four times per day, 6am, noon, 6pm, and midnight. All they had to do was call up to the bridge and have someone read out the current conditions. Operators were TERRIBLE at doing this. Further, the Party Chief was required to take these quarterly reports, compare them to the hourly weather reports we got via email and note any differences... and email those reports back to the main office.\n\nOccasionally, I had to fill in for an operator. I was also terrible about getting the weather. After missing a handful of entries, I wrote a script that played a rooster crowing 4 times a day to remind us to do weather. This was all well and good... for a while... new operators wouldn't know what the chicken was about, or the operator would be in the bathroom or on deck when the rooster crowed, etc. After a while, I changed the script to not only play a rooster sound, but to extract the latest weather report from our email ( there was a weather account on the boat ) and display it on the screen. This was okay, but they were supposed to call up to the bridge to get the REAL weather conditions instead of the weather PREDICTIONS. Operators are lazy. Eventually, I figured out how to connect to the weather computer on the bridge to get precipitation, wind speed and wind direction, and use our heave data to guesstimate the seastate, then extract the emailed weather report, and put it all on the screen as well as email a copy to the party chief. Operators STILL failed to put it into the written logs. \\*sigh\\*",

        "text": "Here is a little story that happened to me last week. Just thought I’d share. Normally the stories posted on here are stories of tech support anguish brought on by incompetent/stupid/lazy (delete as appropriate) users but this story has no users to blame.\n\nFirst a little background. I am a senior desktop engineer however my role is somewhat fluid and I spend more time these days looking after our asset management system (I’ll just call it ASM) and supporting the other engineers. As I was only one of two people who was present when our ASM was installed and configured, I am pretty much responsible for it. This ASM does almost everything for us. Deploying software, deploying Operating Systems, Inventory, Remote support and reporting, you get the drill.\n\nSo, one-day last week I get into to work and first job of the morning is to make sure everything is okay with ASM. A service tends to get stuck, a quick digital slap will normally get it going again. No such problems, just a normal morning… for about 20 minutes. Then just hell. The ASM console stops responding on my device. “Hmmm.” I mumble to myself “Let me check the console on the server”. Console initially loads up fine but the dashboard display is sat on loading and if I click on schedules… nothing, not responding, crash, error 404, fatality, nobody home, go straight to jail, do not pass Go, do not collect $200.\n\nDamn.\n\nI start doing the usually checks like restarting some services, only I get the rather annoying cannot stop service error. No matter, I know a trick, let me get my sledge hammer. I’m going to force choke this service until dead then restart it. I manage to kill off the service and go to restart it but the service times out trying to start. “Wut?”. That has never happened before. Hmm.\n\nBy this time, half the office next door has walked in asking if there is a problem with the ASM as they can’t log in. “Yes, I’m on it.” I exclaim.\n\nOkay, time to do ‘the first step of troubleshooting’. I reboot the server. Server reboots fine. I open the console… still not playing ball. I play around in the console and I realise that not all the functions are down. I can navigate the console just fine. Only the schedule element is dead in the water. Now I should explain what that means. Our ASM uses what is called 'schedules' to push out software, run reports and deploy OS. So while I can navigate the console, check inventories and even remote to devices, no one can deploy any software or image devices, so 95% of what the ASM is used for is not working.\n\nAt this point I’m at a loss. I have scoured the Event Logs but I must stress, my background is in client devices. I have no real server experience and I don’t like messing with them. I have some ideas on what else could be the problem, maybe permissions on some shares have changed (this caused another migraine a few months ago), maybe IIS has crapped out or maybe the SQL database has fallen over.. Well that last one doesn’t make too much sense because I can access the information in the console which comes from the database.\n\nAnyway, I send out an email to the team letting them know the situation and check with the other teams if they have done anything on the network or databases. Nada, nope, nothing. Well, nothing for it then. I am going to have to admit defeat and contact the support company.\n\nI log the problem and as per usual, they ask me to send over a crap ton of logs. While I’m waiting for someone their end to make sense of the matrix I have just sent them, I’m checking through every document I can find on their support portal for anything like the issue we are seeing.\n\nI tried everything including and not limited to. Resetting connections on the database. Changing the accounts on the connections to the database. Checking through all the settings on and resetting IIS. Checking permissions on all the shares. Comparing the settings within the ASM to the screenshots of the settings taken when it was set up. Checking permissions on the SQL Database. Checking every warning and critical error in the event log. Nothing worked.\n\nSupport finally get back to me late in the day and they think the problem is with the SQL Database. They say the application is timing out talking to the database because the requests are getting rejected on the database side.\n\nOh, I’m not a DB admin by the way so yay.\n\nI head round to the next office where luckily DBA guy is there. I explain what they said and forward him some details of some stuff they wanted us to try. As I said, it was late in the day by this point and no way any of this was going to get done now. We agree to take another look the next morning.\n\nI come in the next day and part of me was hoping whatever the problem was, it would sort itself over night. No such luck. I meet up with DBA guy who then runs all these magic SQL things they suggested. I’m still fishing through support documents at this point. After half an hour DBA guy comes back and tells me all those ‘cleaning’ processes are done. I fire up the ASM console with bated breath and… \n\nNo. Still FUBAR’d.\n\nOh, did I mention we had absolutely no management team in that week. I was literally the highest-ranking member of staff in our department. I was starting to think we were going to need to do a complete rebuild of our core ASM server to fix this thing. Panic was slowly starting to creep in I tell you.\n\nI reported back to the support guy that after doing what they asked with the database that it made no difference and were still unable to do anything.  While I waited for a reply, I resumed searching through the archives of no help whatsoever, trying to find anything that could save me from this plight.\n\nThen it happened.\n\nMy colleague next to me was mumbling about a problem ticket he had and them needing something installed. I asked him “Is it a 32 bit or 64 bit OS?”. “I dunno, I can’t check ASM.” He said.  I loaded up the ASM console on my computer. “Oh wait, is ASM working now?” he said. “Sort of, the console works, you can get in and navigate. Just don’t click on any schedules or try to schedule anything”. I had already explained this. He then tries to load the console on his device and it doesn’t load. “It’s not working on mine.” “Oh really! Is it running in the background? Maybe it crashed and is sat in the background. That can happen sometimes”.\n\nI get him to load up Task manager on his device and sure enough the ASM console is running. He kills it off and then launches the console. It loads up. I go back to my computer and notice all the dashboards have loaded…\n\nWait a fudging minute. No way.\n\nI close the console and open it again and the dashboards load almost instantaneously. I click on the schedules and they load. All of a sudden, the ASM system is back up and running. This cannot be a coincidence. I have not just spent a day and a half trying to find out why our ASM is crapping the bed only to discover it was my colleague’s computer with a messed-up console running in the background.\n\nI passed this information onto the support and they said they had never heard of this before but it could potentially happen as each console has direct connection to the database. So if one console badly misbehaves it could lock out an element of the database which in turn could cause the services on the core to fail.\n\nWow, just wow. In some way, I am thankful my colleague hardly ever reboots his computer because if he had, the issue would have been fixed the next morning and I would have no idea why.\n\nOh, to work in I.T.\n\nTL;DR\n\nOur Asset Management System that the entire IT department relies on goes down for a day and half. Problem was caused by a colleagues computer with a faulting application running in the background. 'Task killing' the faulty application fixed it. Just took 1 1/2 days to discover it.",
