After making it through the install with a few challenges, such as not being able to fully use the \"select and install software\" section I've now hit a bit of a wall. It seems the installation is quiet bare compared to the VM versions ive used (im guessing since they didn't connect to the internet during installation, even though the ethernet was connected).

        "text": "I posted on the raspberry pi forums yesterday but it looked like they weren't as active now.  I did get a couple replies though I see.  I was wondering what more hard core linux people think.\n\nI have a 2012 or 2013 raspberry pi.  It's something like the model B generation after they just came out.  I've reimaged it two times now, maybe three.  I just ssh into it from Windows with Putty.  (Yes, it's got a static ip set, and the router has a reserved ip address for it.  It's still getting that reserved ip address fine.  It pings back still, even when ssh isn't working.)\n\nAfter I reimaged it to Bullseye Debian I think with Raspberry Pi OS, I noticed ssh would work but then the next day it wouldn't.  I have some cronjobs running early in the morning, so I'm thinking it's that.  \n\nYes, I know.  It's \"dangerous\" to have updates and upgrades just run blindly.  I want it to keep itself updated.  If something breaks (like ssh now), then I look into it more.  The pi isn't being used for much other than pihole.\n\n\nI added a reinstall of ssh and enabling ssh this morning as a scheduled task, so that might work around the issue.\n\nI'm thinking maybe it's something with moving it from crontab -e to sudo crontab -e, and there was something that wasn't actually working before that is working now.  Or, it's something with Bullseye.\n\n\n\nHere's my raspberry pi forum post...\n\n\nI got a new SD card and put the latest Raspberry Pi OS on my pi. That's Bullseye Debian I think. I have an original Raspberry Pi, one of the early ones from 2012 or 2013, whenever they first came out. Like a model B after the A had been out. 32-bit only I'm pretty sure. That's what I got for the latest Raspberry Pi OS image.\n\nMy Pi isn't used for much now. Pihole mainly.\n\nSo I installed the latest OS, copied my pihole settings in, copied my crontab settings in.\n\nI did and do have ssh set up. That's how I was getting back into it. But I'm finding it's losing ssh somehow. It looks like it's not even installed.\n\n\nIs it something with this?\nBefore I can the crontab set up with \"crontab -e.\" This time I used \"sudo crontab -e.\" I believe that just means it's for the whole machine vs. just the profile I was using. I'm not sure how much that matters. Before it was only crontab -e though. I'm not sure if running as sudo or not matters.\n\nThis is what I've got in the \"sudo crontab -e.\" I just want it to update and upgrade whatever it needs. Yes, I know it's \"dangerous.\" If it really breaks, I can reimage it. I don't have to think about updates or upgrades this way. It has been working on previous images for years.\n\n/usr/bin/sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; /usr/bin/sudo apt-get upgrade -y\n/usr/bin/sudo apt-get update --fix-missing\npihole -up\nsudo pihole -up\n/usr/bin/sudo apt autoremove -y\n/usr/bin/sudo apt upgrade -y\nSaturday reboot -- sudo reboot now\n\n\nI used \"sudo apt install openssh-server\" to install ssh. Still am. Then it works. It must be this morning crontab stuff running that removes it. Maybe the autoremove line?\n\nsudo apt install openssh-server\nsudo service ssh start\n\nThere's no sudo service ssh stop that I'm using. I want ssh on. When I realized ssh was off again today, I check status. Those came up with nothing from what I saw. sudo apt install openssh-server and sudo service ssh start does get it back, but then I have to wire up the pi with a mouse, keyboard, and monitor. Why doesn't it keep ssh installed or keep it enabled?\n\nI'm trying to connect later from a Windows machine with Putty, the latest .78 version of Putty.\n\nAlso, what's the difference between ssh and sshd?\n\nHere's what I was using to check ssh status\nsudo systemctl status ssh\nsudo service sshd status\nI am logging in with the same account on the pi and through ssh when it's working. I don't see the commands I used while on the pi today.\nI used this site with some with grep. It would have been this, with or without the d in sshd. And that's why I'm wondering what that d means.\nps aux | grep sshd\nnetstat -plant | grep :22\nlsof -i\nsudo systemctl status sshd\nsudo systemctl status ssh\nservice sshd status\nservice ssh status\nhttps://linuxhint.com/check-if-ssh-is-running-on-linux/\n\n\nI guess I could try those crontab lines... See if \"sudo apt autoremove -y\" kills the ssh connection....",

        "text": "Hello there !\n\n*Not sure if this is related to GNOME, Okular or KDE... or even with Ubuntu or the Printer driver. Newbie here... but I think it reeeaaaaally needs a fix.*\n\nOn Okular 22.12.1 (flatpak) on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (GNOME 42.5), I wanted to print some pages from a document with the *multipages per sheet* option. I used the usual print dialog in Okular, and set this :  \n\\- in the options : pages \"26-27\" (the pdf is landscape oriented)  \n\\- in the printer settings : two pages per sheet (the printer is in portrait mode)\n\nWhat I expected : **one sheet**, with pages **26-27** printed on the same side.  \nWhat I got : **two sheets**, with pages **51-52** on the first and **53-54** on the second.\n\nIt looks like the process was inverted : it probably FIRST grouped pages 2-by-2, and selected the pages 26 and 27 in the \"new page numbering\". It *should have* selected pages 26 and 27, and THEN grouped them 2-by-2.\n\nI'm opened to post in a more relevant place, but in order to... I would need someone to point out who the *murderer* is.  \nThanks, and have a nice day !  \nM3.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/10i6m19/i_figured_out_how_to_modify_installed_snaps/",
        "text": "A quick Google search will say that it [isn't](https://askubuntu.com/a/1036611) [possible](https://askubuntu.com/a/1034548) to modify an installed Snap. But in the process of [writing a script](https://gist.github.com/TheBrokenRail/c43bf0f07f4860adac2631a1bd9e4136) to bypass Firefox's extension walled garden, I decided I didn't care what the internet thought and did it anyways.\n\nSo here's how to modify a Snap!\n\n**Note:** This process was written for Ubuntu systems, it might be slightly different on other distributions. Also, future updates to Snap itself could break it.\n\n1. Open a terminal.\n2. Find the version of the Snap you have installed: `snap list | grep '&lt;Snap Name Here!&gt;' | awk '{print $3}'`.\n3. This means the Snap itself is stored at `/var/lib/snapd/snaps/&lt;Snap Name Here!&gt;_&lt;Snap Version Here!&gt;.snap`.\n4. Unmount the Snap: `sudo systemctl stop \"snap-&lt;Snap Name Here!&gt;-&lt;Snap Version Here!&gt;.mount\"`.\n5. Run `sudo /usr/lib/snapd/snap-discard-ns &lt;Snap Name Here!&gt;`. This is needed to make sure the old version is fully unmounted. I don't really know why this works and I figured it out with a bunch of trial-and-error. If you don't want to run a mysterious command, you can just skip this step and restart your computer at the end.\n6. Create an empty directory and change your terminal's current directory to it. For instance: `mkdir /tmp/modifying-snap-dir &amp;&amp; cd /tmp/modifying-snap-dir`.\n7. Make the Snap file readable: `sudo chmod o+r '&lt;Snap File Here!&gt;'`.\n8. Extract the Snap: `unsquashfs -d snap '&lt;Snap File Here!&gt;'`.\n9. Do your modifications! All the Snap's files will be located in the directory you created in step 5.\n10. Remove the old Snap file: `sudo rm -f '&lt;Snap File Here!&gt;'`.\n11. Put the Snap back together: `sudo mksquashfs snap '&lt;Snap File Here!&gt;' -noappend -comp lzo -no-fragments`.\n12. Remount the Snap: `sudo systemctl start \"snap-&lt;Snap Name Here!&gt;-&lt;Snap Version Here!&gt;.mount\"`.\n13. You might want to delete the directory you created in step 5, but you don't have to.\n14. If you skipped step 5, restart your computer now.\n\n[Here's an example](https://gist.github.com/TheBrokenRail/c43bf0f07f4860adac2631a1bd9e4136#file-jailbreak-firefox-snap-sh) of this process in shell script form.\n\nAnd of course, just like a modification to a normal piece of installed software, updates will overwrite any changes you make. So you'll have to do this every update.\n\nI hope this helps!",

I though it was because it's a crappy machine, but even lubuntu was taking long time to open any app, plus everything looked like freezing.\n\n\nI didn't tried any other distro, but was forced to reinstall windows 8, which surprisingly worked better than I was expecting. The problem is I am a Linux-派 and would appreciate if there's a distro I could run into it.\n\n\nPS: I'm very broke, so I can't buy anything right now, especially since I'm not from US/Canada and dollar conversion goes bananas very quickly. \n\n\nPS2: My main use is toward studying and programming, some very light games and movie watching.",
