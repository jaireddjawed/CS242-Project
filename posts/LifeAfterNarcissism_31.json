        "text": "Lately I've finally realized this. I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with the idea of triggers. There are different types of triggers. I've been abused a lot by hearing abusive words. So, what I'm about to say is specially about word triggers. \n\nBefore I explain it, I just want to give you an example that happened when I was a child, so bear with me.\n\nWhen I was young, I was asked to do homework. Whenever I did my homework, I was a good kid in Nmom's eyes. I was praised, I was even given affection if I did it, which is so bad because that is a conditioned love, plus, the condition is BAD, I mean, Only getting love when you have As. \n\nWhen I don't do my homework, or showing despair, annoyance, for doing homework. I'm going to be told, I'm not a good child. I'm not a responsible child. I'm not making for my own goods, I'm failing myself. All that shame slapped on me, yes. I'd be shamed if I don't do my homework.\n\nThus, as a child, I was overwhelmed with the slightest idea of homework. \n\nThis example shows that how a narcissist twist a meaning of homework. They turn it into a controlling tool (if you don't do your homework, I won't take you to the park, which happened.), an emotional abusive tool (not doing it and I will shame you).  \n\nTherefore, homework is what I can't access in my life -- when anyone talked about homework. I'd be thinking things that this guy will do to shame me. I'd be thinking what can I do to make my homework perfect, when in essence, homework is just a tool to help me to learn, memorize to apply to things, and my job is just try to do my best, and apply my knowledge, and try to understand things. \n\nThus, homework became something different, something dangerous, something that is *not homework*. The purpose of 'homework' has been stolen, replaced by some strategy that is unhealthy, malicious -- controlling.\n\nThe way I deal with it is by looking up dictionaries, and see the definition of the word, and try to understand it.( I know, that sounds funny right.) Sometimes I even go further to analyze it, and imagine this word spoke in different context, by different people. And thus, I can understand the difference from N's version to the more realistic version. The more a word is skewed, the more effort I have to put to 'purify' it.",

I knew she helped my younger sister (GC) with dance and rehearsal all the time and figured she would be happy to help me. My mother owned a dance studio and every day I waited patiently for her to help me like she helped my sister but she was always too busy or preoccupied.\n\nInstead she ignored my repeated requests until the night of the talent show. I was crying in the back seat because I wanted to enter but I didn't know a dance yet. She told me \"FINE, I'll help you!\" and quickly whipped out a verbal series of steps.\n\nWhen I couldn't dance using just her verbal cues she called me stupid. She then told me to get changed and she drove me to the talent show. Without rehearsal I couldn't dance the steps and all the way home she laughed at me and told me how stupid I was and how bad I looked up on the stage not knowing my steps.\n\nI think that's the last time I ever asked her help with anything.\n\nBy the way, I take dance all the time as an adult and guess what? Turns out I'm pretty good with a little rehearsal! Who knew?\n\nPeace.",

        "text": "Sometimes it feels like I'll never be free of the film of fucking narcissism on my life. How many people do I have to cut out and avoid so I can have a peaceful happy life-?\n\nSo I have a gc brother. Mostly I just forget about him, but someone else mentioned their gc brother and now I'm venty.\n\nWe had a falling out like ten years ago in which I said \"you don't have the kind of place in my life where you get to talk to me like that, so you can either speak to me civilly or not at all, your choice\", because he was being a dick over some business venture. I don't remember exactly what he said, but it was rude enough that I was like ummm boundary.  I know I was brash and direct, but I don't think I was mean or unreasonable.  He's a lot younger than me tho, so we really didn't have a close kind of relationship where we bantered a lot...maybe that made putting my foot down harsher, but it also made his rudeness more jarring.\n\nAnyway, HE remembers me saying \"you have no place in my life!!!\" and he promptly stopped talking to me forever.  He told my emom his version of events, and she begged me to apologize as the cold war stretched into months. I wrote him two emails explaining the misunderstanding and emphasizing that I wanted to move past it bc I cared about our relationship...he never responded. \n\nHe told my mom that my apology \"wasn't good enough\" and he was still hurt.  I said, \"well, I was sincere, and clear about caring about our relationship. I said I was sorry for being rude, as explained myself. I can't apologize for what he says I said, bc I didn't say that. I said something with similar words but not THAT, bc I would never say THAT. so I'm happy to own my part, but he kinda needs to own his too. I have a side to this story too, and everyone is kinda forgetting that whatever *I* said was in response to hurtful shit HE said. So nobody's innocent, everybody's hurt, we can both be sorry and move on maybe?\" \n\nNo. She told me \"you don't get to pick and choose what you're sorry for, if you're sorry you're sorry. Uhh what? Another time she told me, you don't get to decide if your apology is good enough, if the other person says it's not, then it's not. Ummmmm ok I guess, but also what about his part in things, and all the other nice stuff I said, and could he not respond AT ALL, like how does it not even count that I TRIED and he DOESN'T? And worst, it really hurts my fucking feelings that, obviously this person is willing to just ignore me into dust, obviously he doesn't really care about me much if he's going to write me COMPLETELY OFF regardless of what words I used, so you continually pushing me to rekindle the relationship is actually hurtful. Who pressures someone into a relationship with someone who OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T LOVE THEM?! Her so obviously taking his side has really damaged our relationship too. We never talk about it anymore, thank god, but it's obvious she favors him, spends more time with him, gives him the pick of the separate holidays, calls him to chat but not me, etc.\n\nSo, gcbro and I just don't speak. Over the years I've texted to see if he was okay when natural disasters struck his area, invited him via my mom to holiday things, sent random memes, something maybe twice a year.  He completely ignores it all.  He only responded once, when I was bringing my son to town, bc he wanted to see him.  Oh, and he texted asking what to get my son for Xmas this year, and then didn't respond to my ideas.  Just say \"k.\" Like a normal person, or god forbid \"thanks\"! It's just so fucking stupid, like you have to TRY not to be accidentally civil to someone.\n\nSo mostly I just ignore all concept of siblings and figure, like parents, they're not all good ones. But it's hard sometimes, when you're nc with ndad, strained with emom *and* your brother dgaf about you. And now he's moving back to town soon, all my family keep mentioning it to me, like how the fuck am I supposed to react to that?? People move to town every day that also aren't in my life. I guess it'll have to be some awkward thing tho, as everyone obviously will want to invite us both to things and then stare at our interactions for their own entertainment. Thanks fam. *sigh*\n\nTL;DR: So, I guess I'm wondering about how you all deal with apologies, and your gc and e family members that you still see.  Do you agree that if you're sorry for something, then it's just up to you to do whatever the other person wants to make it right? Have you ever chased after someone and been glad you did?? My take is usually that it takes two to made a functional relationship, but SO MANY PEOPLE I'm related to seem to think I'm wrong about this, that sometimes I hear their voices in my head.

        "text": "And then beat themselves up when they realize the situation was not good and they could have just left? \n\nI've been in a casual job on and off for the past 2.5 years. I realize it would have been better to quit sometime early last year for my mental health, and the fact that the job treated me poorly and often cut my hours for no reason. I kept it, though, on the advice of a therapist, and the pressure of 'should'. It ended up with me leaving anyway, and with more negative memories of the place than I should have. \n\nI realize, in hindsight, most reasonable people would have simply quit this job, or taken a hiatus, to find something more reliable to pay the bills. It made sense from a practical and an emotional standpoint. \n\nThe thing is...I was often forced to do things WAY longer than most people - bad jobs, humiliating situations, fleeting hobbies, uncomfortable relationships - it was 'my fault' if this didn't work out. I had to make it work. Quitting, admitting the truth - that I was no longer interested in the hobby, that the job was a bad fit, that I had outgrown the relationship - was met with questioning and accusations of 'giving up'. How can we learn to trust our convictions and respond honestly to the 'real world', which won't shame us for doing what's right for us? How do we forgive ourselves when we fall back into these patterns and clash uncomfortably with the world, often causing an unnecessary 'mess'. \n\nI'm still learning to do this, and having trouble forgiving myself for the job situation. I would have been further along if this wasn't the case. I don't understand why I entered into a co-dependent relationship with a workplace. Maybe it's other people thinking it's 'good' for me, when really that's just an echo of Nparenting. It's hard to understand and fully appreciate that what's good for you is also what makes you feel good in many instances, when this is the absolute opposite of everything I learned growing up. The lesson I was taught was that the only thing that was 'good' for me was pain. \n\nI don't know if anyone relates to this. I've not been very specific, so I apologize for coming across as vague. Thanks for reading.  \n\n",

A's parents are also Ns, though A doesn't want to acknowledge them as such. Stories that A have told over the years generally reconfirm this to me. A is trans the issues around that are huge, so I understand the tendency to gloss over N parents issues. I did that too for a long time because I was dealing with giant medical issues. \n\nLast night A got drunk at my home as we were drinking together and said some things that are bothering me. A thinks that my NC is unhealthy, that my desire to talk to with Nmom will just grow until bursting. When I responded that no I didn't really think of Nmom very much anymore he responded with that was unhealthy because no one would ever love you more than your mom. I strongly disagreed because Nmom never really loved me, she loved that cardboard cut out she had decided was skippedrecord. In fact, Nmom worked actively to suppress my individuality, many people have loved me for me much more than Nmom.\n\nA then talked about how a fight was building with his mother, but he was looking forward to it because 'who better to fix the flaws of his parents he knows them' and 'it would feel nice to put his mom in her place finally'. That freaked me out.\n\nA also accused me of being condensing and when I apologized by saying I was sorry if it came across that way was not my intention just trying to be supportive while also firmly disagreeing. Apparently, I failed at that. I'm getting the same vibe I got from Nmom, that he's just throwing out an insult because I've said some that hurt them.\n\nThere is a trend now of red flags that I'm having a hard time ignoring. But A is part of my group of friends so I can't just ghost. A is also part of a business that I haven't managed to get off the ground with another friend. I don't want to try to get that business of the ground anymore and will have to have a discussion with other friend about that.\n\nI KNOW that NC was and is the very best choice for me. I KNOW that Nmom's 'love' was fake and contingent on being someone else. I KNOW I can and should require that others accept me for me because it isn't real love any other way. \n\nI am worried though that this is proof of my co-dependency and shitty choices that could mean future bad choices are imminent, but next time instead the consequences will not be just losing what I thought was a solid and deep friendship, it will be a contentious divorce with debt and kids.",

Forgiving and forgetting and letting go are three totally different things. I still need to let go of the anger. \n\nToday I did something useful. It felt petty at first, but by the end it was great. I went back through my facebook timeline deleting anything to do with an ex who had *never* been who she said. And it made me realize that the only actual good times, the only things I came across between us were times that i remember feeling stressed out and unresolved about comments she had made. Like as soon as things seemed good, say we'd be on a road trip, I'd find out we were at a restauraunt (she had chosen the stop) that her late husband loved. Literally 30 restaurants in a town 2 hours from home and you accidentally chose this one?... I was her driver on a tour of her old life (her late husband was, by all telling, and in a way that shocked me that so many people would speak so ill of the dead, an utter asshole. This was not clear up front). \n\nI came to realize that some of the things I attributed as good times while we were dating, happened in the month before we actually started dating... while she was (more seriously than she had let on) seeing someone else.  I had the timeline messed up, and I have to think it was wishful misremembering. Actually going through the documentary evidence of what happened in what order was eye opening. \n\nI really got the perspective on just how used for her distraction I was. And all the while she is introducing me to family, and talking marriage, etc.... but then she'd say something about how much money I made and how nice it was to imagine adding her savings to mine and alarm bells would go off. \n\nWeekly alarm bells, I heard them loud and clear, in hindsight, as I went through and vandalized my own facebook timeline. \n\nAnd I am glad I did. This is how I let go of the anger. I remember that I was my best, hopeful, invested. And I was clearly conned. Some of the best times that she brought up as 'the good times' were from our friendship, and those were one sided.It's all obvious in hindsight, and I need never be reminded of it again. \n\nIt was fun in a time when I needed fun, sometimes. It was also excruciatingly unkind at times. Unkind to herself, or me, or to innocent bystanders. There was always an unkind edge whenever things got good. I see that now. I see the eggshells I walked on. \n\nDelete, delete, delete. Honor the feelings, let of of the reminders of  the abuse. Delete delete delete.   \n\nI hope for her sake she continues to choose non-violent men. A lesser man would have been retaliatory in unpleasant ways. I said my peace and left. And then I deleted all the facebook evidence that we ever knew one another. I just did that and I did it with the pride I denied myself the whole time I knew her. ",

        "text": "I have been NC with pretty much my entire FOO for about a year and a half now, some longer. Anyway, I have worked through the guilt and now understand what I was to my Nrents, an object who should have never had any individuality or personality. It feels good to be free of thinking I should uphold some fake obligation based on genetics. \n\nHowever, I still struggle with finding my confidence. I am an accomplished person, but I have taken some years off from waged work to do \"nontraditional\" or unorthodox work by concentrating on my creative side and selling the art I make. I went back to school last year and completed a certificate program in a field that is growing, and I am still looking for a job. It used to be no problem in years past; I could get hired by multiple companies if I had wanted to at any time. This is a whole new field for me, and I am taking that into consideration of course, but I am anxious and feel overwhelmed at times with all the information I'm still processing to get my feet wet and eventually be successful in this field. I also have to study for my certification bar exam. I'm taking little bites, but there is so much to do and I beat myself up about it unnecessarily. I know this is leftover conditioning, and I am doing my best to be easier on myself. My husband notices it all the time and is very patient with me, very encouraging and sweet and I don't know what I would do without him.\n\nI guess after realizing that these people whom I was brainwashed into believing were there for me really weren't, I find myself having to start all over again. When I was younger and moving up the ranks in different organizations almost effortlessly, it seemed I ran on a lot of anger, and achievement was a way to displace that. I didn't think twice about it. I did consciously realize how angry I was and joined forums back in earlier internet days to explore that, and it was helpful. I didn't come across more specific realizations with regard to narcissism and abuse till many years later and, in some ways, it's broken me all over again.\n\nI'm moving on and taking it day by day with my new career, but I feel like I'm holding myself back because of their (Nrents') conditioning. They wanted me dependent in some way though I always [had to] stake out my own financial independence -- their support and sheltering of my siblings was their way of trapping them. I have always been the one who was made conscious of being \"the example\" as the oldest; this was hammered into me so much I became overly self-conscious and hyperaware of how I conducted myself. This led to acting out when I was young. I abused drugs and alcohol to get rid of that hyperawareness and forget before I had to go back to work or school and be a super being that can't exist in any world. I have a bipolar diagnosis and take medication to control it, and it's hard to tell what was a driving factor and what was a symptom. Chicken or egg? Hard to tell -- was I predisposed or did Nrent abuse lead to substance abuse which led to this eventual mind split? \n\nNow I'm rambling. Thanks for reading if you did, and I would appreciate any words of advice. Most of all, I want to find that confidence again but not through the unhealthy means that I came to base my life around before I was able to make some meaningful changes about really respecting myself.",

        "text": "Not sure if 'ruminate' is the right word. Pardon me if my English is somehow clumsy. I'm trying my best. \n\nThis is the only place, where I can put out a piece of myself out there that is genuine and not getting judgements as a result. For the rest of the world, I can't. \n\n\nI realized I am isolated in this world. We are.  Feminism, racial minorities, poor people, they have representatives for them to speak for them, in the public or in the media, but then, we don't. No one is going out there, telling the world what narcissism is about.  Unlike the LGBTQ community, we don't have a large group of community , we don't have a fun, heart-warming parade to display to the world that we are actually awesome people. Unlike some minorities, We don't have a TED talk, that demonstrates to the world, either by telling a heart-breaking, personal story of a narcissist's abuse (let's face it, it's going to be miserable, not a happy story, but it can be beneficial in some way), or by showing in a scientific way, of how narcissism can harm people, psychologically. \n\n\nThe nearest thing we have is a psychological document(done by the BBC, you may google it), which demonstrates the social, psychological effects that a narcissist can be done on other people, filmed in 2013. However, it was nothing really near to a more personal, childhood experience. We were children, and it was a lifetime of childhood abuse for a child, then, there was nothing similar has been written on this topic. \n\n\nAdditionally, the inability to break this state of dilemma is related to culture. A lot of these stories of miserable parenting were tied , to the cultural background(many are asians that I have observed). Knowing this in my mind, I just knew how much it is harder to get attention from the public that we are in a alarming state, and we need help.  (It pains me a little every time I think of this. If you ask me, how hard is it to break into my culture, and make 'self-worth' actually a thing, and able to defend it when called upon without any cost? I will answer.. Very hard.)\n\n\nThat's all for now. I don't know if someone in this world would read this and decide to make a change on paper, on the internet, or on anything. I just hope, this will inspire some of you. It's hard to see when minorities are getting unseen. It's even harder, when the minority is you. \n\n\nOf course, there is always a bright side. (Like everything, there is)  Having RBN is one of them.  With RBN, the world doesn't feel as lonely as it is. With RBN, I know at least, there is one space that I can speak with a true mind without fear of getting judged. With RBN, a lighthouse was established in my life, and it guided through me to see the midst as a task to be tackled, instead of a doomed state.\n\n\nThe whole point of this text, is however, not the positives or the negatives, but more about how much attention we should get, or need to get from the rest of the world, especially in the media, in order to raise the awareness of *narcissistic* abuse in childhood. I hope one day, maybe in my lifetime, I will see a TED talk, or true stories of narcissistic abuse on the TV. That would be incredible.  (Life needs to move on, so does humanity.)  If I ought to wish for something like that, I'll will need to put in my efforts, in writing stories, having a blog, perhaps. Well.",

In that time my life changed dramatically; I gave birth to my daughter (now nearly 2) and have got married.\n\nJust recently I've been sending emails to my NDad, and he's been replying. I felt a bit put on the spot about this, a counsellor suggested it would be good for my daughter to know that part of her family in a controlled way before she starts to wonder and possibly finds them/is influenced by them when she's older, my brother also made me feel guilty as apparently NDads been really down/suicidal since I stopped contact and he's worried he'll do something I might be responsible for/regret - yes my brother does have Narc tendencies but they tend to be less prevalent towards me as he's younger than me, so therefore there's no authority/superiority.\n\nThe emails started about 2 weeks ago and I'm already starting to regret agreeing to them. I feel like I'm being blamed for everything (I did expect this as he's N but blimey it's tough), including my in-laws apparent dislike of him - I've never ever discussed him or what happened in my childhood with them so they're opinions are completely their own as I suspect my husband hasn't told them anything. He also claims I've been using my daughter as a weapon against him - I haven't spoken to him in 2 and a half years, he's met her once and it was too much too soon so I stepped away, I really don't see what I've done.\n\nHe's making demands of me, to meet up and to continue contact no matter what the mental cost. (His exact words in the email was \"continue to stay in touch even if it's tough on one or both of us\").\n\nMy anxiety is through the roof since it started, I can't concentrate and I feel like crying. I have enough to deal with atm as my daughter has extra needs due to a delay and my husband is also ill. But I feel like I can't just stop contact again, what if NDad hurts himself?\n\nGod I hate my life sometimes :'(",

        "text": "I previously felt as though my brother and I used to get along, but now I look back and recognize he never respected me. He and Nmom would team up together in their sick cycle that they had cultivated years before I was born. They would belittle my choices, make me feel weak, talk about me behind my back and then confront me with their arsenal of backstabbing and tag-teaming. This was all under the guise of 'concern' for me. I've always felt like an outsider to the family and now I see that I was treated as such.\n\nIt's funny how distancing yourself from the abuse really does allow it to become more clear.\n\nOur dad had a suicide scare a couple of years ago. He texted 9 people, including my brother, with a 'goodbye I'm ending my life' message. I was the only person who called him back, out of the rest of his children and loved ones. I alone talked him out of suicide. I tried to immediately call my GCbrother. He's my older brother, it was pure instinct to call him for guidance. He refused to return my calls when I was frantically trying to reach him to stop our fathers freaking death. That was 2 years ago and he is still burying his head in the sand pretending like I don't exist. He doesn't even know that I talked Dad out of suicide because he's never bothered to ask me or talk to me. \n\nMy father ended up in ICU in a coma shortly after the text was sent (due to health issues, not suicide).\n\nMy GCbrother teamed up with my Nmom to try and manipulate the doctors into believing that Nmom and dad are still married. They've been divorced for 30+ years and dad has specifically said he wants nothing to do with the woman. She kept trying to get the doctors to believe she had final say over all of my dad's health decisions WHILE HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS. And GC brother assisted her with these disgusting lies every step of the way. I had to stand up and put myself in the line of fire and tell the doctors and nurses the truth. Of course this led to more estrangement from the rest of the family, the landscape of which has only deepened and broadened in scope as the years go on.\n\nHave you ever had a loved one in ICU? The doctors and nurses will not divulge personal information about the patient unless you have the the established numerical code.\n\nOnce again, my GCbrother not only lets her keep up the facade and lies, BUT HE GAVE HER THE CODES. multiple times. I changed the code so many times, I don't even remember how many, because she kept calling and lying. And he enabled her every moment.\n\nIt was one of the most terrible and difficult experiences I have ever been through. I aged years in the span of a month.\n\nNow my dad is back in the hospital. And I'm having to deal with my brother's petty and rude behavior. At least it's not new to me now, as it was before. But I hate that it still hurts.\n\nTL;DR - Nmom and GCBrother were always a sick tag-team and now that my dads health is at risk, the N's are rolling around in so much shit it's leaking my way.\n\nEdited to add: Thanks for reading, I just really wanted to vent to folks who understand.

Do you ever feel like you are liking the same thing with the narc, but in someways, not really?\n\n(I've read a book today, it says that most narcissists are unreal. They share things with you, but they never mean it. )\n\nNmom had a lot in common with me. In the author's word, however, it is the narc's attempt to make me *felt* I had a lot in common with them in order to con me. I can't wrap my head against this. It seemed so real. I couldn't think of anyway to deny it.  (We both love Japan, eating sushi, snack food, creative things)\n\nBut somehow, the author did strike a chord in me. My Nmom maybe, doesn't really like Japan or creative things anyways. After 9 years of not seeing her, she didn't mention a word about her 'love' about Japan, or creative things in any way. She didn't even mentioned a word about *the days we really had fun with food*. \nI guess I'm the only one who remembers? This all seem too bizarre to me. \n(I guess the once amusing thing to her isn't that amusing afterwards.)\n\nWhy would a person pretend to like something that they don't? Why would a person *forget* something that is so important? Or maybe ... it isn't important at all, to her. \n\nIf this isn't helpful, then that's fine. Figuring a narc is but confusing. No concrete answers are expected. \n\nBtw, the book I'm reading is From Charm to Harm: And Everything Else in Between with a Narcissist, if anyone else is interested~ ",

He likes hunting and sports. I like fantasy games and epic stories. He likes physical activity, and I like long discussions about deep topics. He likes superbowl parties. I like sitting down with friends to play D&amp;D. Geeze, I make him sound like a hick and he's so not, lol. I just mean, we've always had different interests while still respecting each others interests. I mean, Dad bought me D&amp;D books for my Bday. I'd buy him ammo for his! Neither of us judged each other for our beliefs. We accepted it. Now, I feel like I've lost that. \n\nI miss this respectful relationship we use to have. And now I realize that, maybe the reason we've lost it is because I have removed any reason he can find to look me in the eyes and tell me he's proud of me. I'm his only begotten kid (tho he has stepkids and kid-in-laws). I've been his kid the longest (even tho they are all older than me). I don't want to lose him. \n\nI think the thing is, I've been mad at my dad for a long time now. I feel like he's given up on me. Maybe that's true. He hates my Nmom for how much she screwed me up. He says he'll never forgive her. But I'm middle aged now. I still need him. Part of me never grew up because of her abuse, and I still need him to be my Dad, the sane parent! I know he's holding his tongue on his feelings. I wish he would open up and tell me what he truly thinks, no matter how painful it is to me. I wish I could have a dialogue with him, work through all this thick silent tension and find that \"respecting each others' differences\" state again.\n\n",

I could write a novel about what this woman has done and all the abuses of power, but the most recent one has me fuming. \n\nWe're in the military and Boss is the highest ranking officer on base. Whatevs. I was making chit chat with him at the holiday party that was held in the base's gym and he was mentioning how the best part of where his high ranking officer house is, is actually it's proximity to the gym. You see, no one uses this gym so he and his teenage son come and get rowdy in the evenings in the winter. He said it's like having his own personal indoor basketball court. That's cute, I think to myself. I'd probably do it too if my toddler didn't go to bed promptly at 6. I'm glad he's using it and I'm glad his kids are enjoying it. \n\nThen this past week boy scouts started up and the local faction that many of the boys on base are a part of started to meet in the gym one evening a week for a couple hours. No big deal, because no one uses the basketball court in the evenings, right? Except for N family.\n\nThe high ranking officer then canceled the boy scouts meeting and kicked them out because their use of the gym was 'interfering with active duty members using the basketball court'. Except it's only Boss' middle aged butt and his teenager who can go LITERALLY ANY OTHER DAY OF THE WEEK. No rescheduling, he just straight kicked them out. He doesn't even have authority to do that but everyone is afraid of him. Who did he kick out, exactly? 30 kindergarteners and their active duty troop volunteers. 5 year olds and some dads.\n\nI heard that an even higher ranking officer stepped in and reversed it, then apologized to the affected parties, so it's solved, right?\n\nI'm not even involved in this. It doesn't affect me in any way, and it's freaking solved, but I've been furious all morning. I can't let it go. Maybe because it's exactly what my dad would do? It's the blatant disregard for anyone other than himself. My dad had this way of completely dismissing you, as if you and your presence had no value at all.. it made me question like, am I even alive witnessing this? He didn't ever stop and think, how would other people react to this? What would they think of it? He didn't even think: what will they think of me? He just assumed everyone thought he was the most fun, cool, attractive person in the world and everyone else is carte blanc not given any thought. immediate dismissal. \n\nHow do I let it go?",

I even feel guilty about the cognitive dissonance I feel wherein I know who she really is yet still desire the character to be realizable.\n\nThis is a woman who lied pathologically for years, and it started literally the day we married (way too fast - the lovebombing was too powerful on me). And I knew she lied, and despite having no place for liars in my life, for some reason I excused her. The lies slowly grew, future faking and gaslighting, words I didn't know at the time, but enough to make me raise an eyebrow and go \"Huh?\" Then after the first was born, the crazy went in full swing, and not just with her, but her abusive parents showed their true colors. I chalked it up to post-partum and cultural differences. Then the threats to take him away from me, which I can't understand why I didn't see it as a deal breaker. I was so committed to not having MY family disintegrate like my parents' family did that I was going to stick through anything and I thought rationality would prevail. Then after the youngest boy was born it went off the rails. I was punished for wanting to be a father to him, cut out of our marriage completely for nearly two years. That's when I first researched emotional abuse, and came to the dreaded realization that she was abusing me. What did I do? Well I put on my hero underpants and said I would save her from herself. I'd try harder. So I gave and gave and it was still never enough. And I said, ok, fine - let's do what you want. We wil cross that ocean and get you closer to your home. I had an amazing job, worked for one of those big shot fruit companies in California. You probably own something I helped make. I gave up that salary, nearly $300k in stock, uprooted my boys, and moved for her. And she changed completely she we got here. Swindled away money. Cut me out again. Got her parents in on the act. My world was spinning. I had no idea what was happening, but I cried to her so many times and she simply ignored me. She took the boys for a weekend to her mom, kept them there. Never came back. Courts didn't force her to. So now I have to move (again) and find a new job (again) and begin to build up my finances (again - we were cash-heavy as buying a house was the supposed plan... she grabbed half and didn't look back) all the while just fighting to see my sons.\n\nThe institutions tasked with protecting my kids don't see this as abuse. Actually they look at me and say \"You're a father! How can you care for these boys!?\" And my ex just eggs that on. \n\nI allowed this all to happen. I should have ended this 15 years ago at the first lie. Or any of the other lies. Or the threats to take my son away. Or any other time. I was so severely emotionally abused, I couldn't get away. And my inaction has destroyed my life. When my kids grow up, what will they say? How will they cope when they realize Mum and Gran kidnapped them? I know I'm not the bad person, but I bear a lot of fault in this. \n\nI still have no idea how to recover from this. I'll never forgive myself, and I fear I can't even get past her. I still find myself dreaming of reconciling, both because I would get to see my boys more, it would be easier than fighting, and I still passionately love the character she played. I feel like a husk. This woman who is actively seeking to ruin me because of my inability to fix her, I fear I would take her back in a heartbeat if she hoovered. I can't explain why, I can't explain how bad and pathetic that makes me feel. I just want the pain to go away, and I feel like going back to that known pain is better than the complete unknown I am currently dealing with.\n\nNarcissism ruins lives.",

Mods, if this is not the correct subreddit, feel free to delete.  \n\nThe title says it all.  It was anxiety and depression, which led to self-harm.  Cut up her whole left arm, wrist to elbow, it looks pretty bad.  She's been in there since Tuesday morning, today was the first time I got to see her in person, but only for an hour.  She's doing a lot better than when she went in, but there is a whole lot of stuff she still hasn't started to process or work through yet.  There is a grand total of 2 hours of visiting time per week; an hour on Wednesday and an hour on Saturday.  I think the absence is the worst part of this whole ordeal.\n\nI broke down and cried for the first time since she went in.  Probably the first time in two decades I actually sobbed and cried into my pillow.  I've been pretty numb up until this point.  I've wept before today, but not the ugly crying, chest wracking, deep breath screaming sobs a toddler usually has.  This hurts, a lot.  And there's not much I can do out here except tell her I love her, and tell her I will always stand by her.\n\nI wrote her a letter today, gave it to her during our visit along with a copy of our wedding vows.  It was written with love and praise, but I knew it would result in a lot of crying from both of us.  I'm just sitting at home with just our three cats, no children, and I'm feeling abysmally alone. \n\nI don't really know what I hope to accomplish by posting this.   I am hoping some of the people who read this have dealt with a spouse's mental illness and their struggles with it, and know that they are not alone.  If your spouse has gone into inpatient mental health care, it would be helpful to hear your stories and coping tips as well.  This is foreign territory for me, and I'm stumbling around in a dark room here.  What can you do to support someone you love in a mental hospital besides remind them that you love them?\n\nI will include a transcript of the letter below, and if anybody desires to see the (long) marriage vows I wrote for us, PM me and I'll send you a copy.  Thank you for reading this.\n\n&gt; To the Woman that I love, \n\n&gt; \tI did not love you when we first met; we were two lost souls desperately searching for someone to cling to, running from shadows we had yet to name or face. I first knew I loved you when I started looking for a gem for the engagement ring that you had no idea was coming.  No ordinary gem would do, because you are no ordinary lady.  I was petrified, because I truly did not know if you would say yes.  That's why I stayed down on my knee for so long before you answered.  I did not know if you were crying for joy or crying because you were afraid to say no.  \n\n&gt; \tI proposed to you because I thought you were different.  You were unlike any girl or woman I had met before or since, and yet I saw the struggles in you that I have gone through myself.  You have shared things with me that you had not shared with anybody.  You let me see a side of you that was scared, fragile, anxious, and full of self doubt, when the rest of the world saw a confident, driven, funny, and resilient woman.  \n\n&gt; \tThis past week has me re-evaluating all that I thought I knew.  All that I thought I loved.  I see a scared little girl inside the strong woman that is my wife and my partner.  I see someone who would rather feel physical pain than emotional pain.  I see someone who overachieves and must constantly go go go, because she is overly critical of herself, and scared of what will bubble up to the surface of her psyche if she is not constantly on the move.  \n\n&gt; \tI thought you were different.\n\n&gt; \tI was right.\n\n&gt; \tTo quote the lyricist Brad Paisley, I thought I loved you then.  At this point, I feel that love is not a strong enough word.  You are a strong and noble woman for sharing your struggles with me.  You are brave for facing your demons head on, and telling me when you needed help fighting them.  You are a success for all the people you have helped and all the love you have given freely to all.  You are an inspiration.  And you are my everything.  \n\n&gt; \tI have included a transcript of our marriage reading.  Not to shame you, or make you feel like you owe me anything, but to remind you of the vows we took.  We will cause each other pain, cause each other to anger, and burden each other.  This experience has been painful for both of us.  But we will also laugh together, dream together, and love together.  I want you to know that you are more important to me than anything else, and how deep my feelings for you are.\n\n&gt; \tI love you [wife].  I love you [wife's avatar].  Thank you for letting me into your life.  I am a better man and person because of you.  I want to be strong enough to be your man, if you will let me.  Take all the time you need to learn how to love and respect yourself, for you already know how to love and respect everyone else.  I will be waiting, as long as it takes, until you are ready.  \n\n&gt; \tThe Man who loves you with everything he has,\n\n&gt; [Husband][/u/talented_fool]",

I almost tried to ring them up before tending to my wound! I would have stained their clothes with blood as I have to take sensors off and fold them nicely into a bag.    \nI instead politely asked them if they could go to a different register as I've cut my hand.    \nI know this is small but it's a good first step to self care. Honestly before NC and therapy I probably would have figured out a way to check the customers out without them even knowing I cut myself and prayed I wouldn't stain their clothes!\n\nMy injured body comes first, understandably.    \n\nAny advice on self care?

I'm not sure if it's RBN stuff or my bipolar but I seem to not want to live my life actively, though I WANT to go to graduate school. It's insane how I'm behaving. I also just handed in my FAFSA late 3 days, but whatever it's done. I also missed all my scholarship deadlines. I don't know what's wrong with me. \n\nSo now in my head I'm going OMG what am I going to do. How can I afford the plane ticket. Am I going to be in debt forever? Do I need to overcharge my credit card? \n\nDo I need a car in new state? I don't have a job! Who will sell me a car even if it's infinity months of downpayment. \n\nI also applied to other graduate schools but again same problem what do I do. I'm not even sure I can afford the fees. Each school is 100+ some and I may apply to 4 schools. The other thing is I want to be out ASAP, but the deadlines are weird so I may have to go for January IDK how that will happen. \n\nIn terms of the forms: I got my passport. I know where my birth certificate is. I found out where my checks to my bank account are (blank checks). I guess I have to take them with me? \n\nI also applied to programming school where they teach you programming for free, but never was a programmer OMG this thing is due in a month. But if I get this done and get to go to programming school I can get programming jobs. \n\nI might want to study for the MCAT but I'm not sure it's in April and I'm not sure if I want to or don't want to study for it. \n\nAnd if I get into the out of state graduate school which I said I was applying to a month ago, then I will also have to prepare to move outside of the country for a year whew. \n\nDo you guys have any advice on how to plan better/get myself more motivated/follow lists? I feel not good at all about everything and I'm not being active. \n\nThanks. ",

        "text": "I was talking to my hubby about one thing or another a few days ago, and I suddenly realized that I subconsciously fail things on purpose to spite my Nmom. When I was growing up, she loved to brag about all the wonderful things I did to all her friends and colleagues. She would even go so far as to state completely inaccurate or exaggerated things. Sometimes I would even correct her on the spot, and she would wave it off with a smile like it was no big deal but then yell at me later for correcting her in front of others. \"Adults were talking, and you should know when to shut up and smile.\" Of course, she never said she was proud of me to me. She never talked to me when she was doing all this praise, and what praise I overheard said to strangers was always exaggerated or straight up a lie. I started feeling inadequate, like I could never measure up to her expectations. I blamed myself for being too pathetic to make her proud. It was my fault she was forced to lie. It got worse when she started claiming to have raised 11 other kids, like she was so ashamed of me that she had to claim other people as her kids so she could brag about her glory as a mother.\n\nWell, looking back on it now, I realize that I was also angry. Over the decades, I have systematically removed everything she can brag about in regards to me. I'm 41 now, and there is NOTHING in my life that she can brag to people about. Every aspect of my lifestyle and choices is so far removed from her, that I can't imagine what she could possibly say to others about me that would make her look like some super mom.\n\nSo, now that I realize this, what comes next? Input appreciated, because apparently, therapists don't take Medicare. \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I'm sorry for the length of this post.\n\nMy [M, 19] parents were not Ns but were emotionally abusive towards me and I am estranged from them. My partner \"Sam\" [F, 19] has considerable FLEAs from her alcoholic, neglectful, and abusive father.\n\nSam got in a fight with our friend \"Amy\", her roommate, which I am now in the middle of. Sam got upset at Amy's binge drinking and made some subtle dig at her, to which she responded by becoming agitated and defensive, which caused Sam to break into tears and tell her to leave the room. Amy later recounted this to me as “Sam screamed at me for drinking because I'm depressed.” From this incident Amy concluded that Sam was, as she said, “emotionally stunted” and “reacts with rage”. When a very volatile and easily upset member of our group left, he blamed Sam, among others, for antagonizing him over his ridiculous comments. While Amy didn’t care about the other accusations, she cared about Sam's, declaring her again “rage-filled”.\n\nBy this point they had already arranged to live together the following year. Immediately, Amy became enraged when I fell asleep in Sam's bed without advance notice - her group having gone to a concert until 3am - making angry comments to others about it for over a week afterwards. Finally she demanded Sam negotiate the year’s roommate agreement with her out in the lounge instead of in private, so that she could then publicly humiliate her for having me over. Amy then smugly confronted me about this, mocking me when I defended myself. Eventually she decided that Sam's resulting silent/passive-aggressive dislike of her was intolerable and “depressing” to her, so she again confronted Sam, demanding to know what the problem was, and giving her an angry and condescending stare, before Sam finally responded angrily that she didn’t want to talk about it but that Amy had been a “bitch” to her. Amy construed this as, “Sam screamed at me and I was triggered.”\n\nAmy always had a habit of making one feel bad about oneself, which I experienced on multiple occasions. She is very aggressive generally, and insists on being right - she is known to get visibly angry at people, including me, over the course of political discussions. When you don’t agree with her, in addition to just being angry, she also condescends to you and may mock you to others. At times when I considered her my best friend, our conversations often consisted largely of her detailing at length her own considerable problems, such that eventually I mostly just started conversations about her issues, knowing that’s what would get traction.\n\nThe problem is that many of these same criticisms are leveled against Sam. Sam is known to get angry and aggressive when she feels threatened socially, which happens easily. She can also complain a lot and generally come off as prickly or negative. The Sam I know is really kind and open, and always supports me, but she does not show this to many people besides me. She wants very much to be a kind person and to have friends.\n\nNow Amy and her group of friends, I have learned, is talking about me behind our backs as well. They believe Sam is \"irrational\" and bitchy and crazy, and that I am \"brainwashed\" into defending her, and that our relationship only persists because we're both \"afraid no one else will love us\". They all act friendly towards Sam even while apparently dreading talking to her, and also plan things that will annoy her to watch her reaction. Obviously I don't believe any of these things about our relationship. But, faced with criticism from so many people who I considered my friends, I no longer have any idea what I feel or what I should do. I keep thinking: What if they're right? What if Sam and I were the ones acting terribly this whole time, what if I have isolated myself from them just to defend her? What if she's actually a terrible angry person like they all say and I should leave her? What if my judgment of Amy was horribly distorted and everything I concluded was wrong? I am utterly lost and alone and I feel nauseous. Please help me.",

Back then--and now in the current political climate--I felt trapped, powerless to change anything, and frustrated.\n\nAfter talking about it with my SO, he suggested writing letters to our government representatives. Sending snail mail is surprisingly effective, and is more likely to produce a response than other forms of contact.\n\nWhatever your political leanings, consider taking action if you're feeling trapped and helpless.

        "text": "I don't hate the holidays. Christmas use to be my second favorite (Halloween first). But my life is very different now. I live on a fixed income, and it's just me and hubby. We don't have kids. Neither of us is close to extended family. For us, Xmas, Birthdays and the like are just days we have to remember so we can do annual chores of calling parents to say the obligatory messages: Merry Christmas, Happy New Years, Happy Birthday, Happy Anniversary, Happy Fathers'/Mothers' Day, etc. I have to make two calls, one to my dad and his wife, and one to Nmom (who is with someone I don't really talk to).\n\nOn Thanksgiving, I was good, I called them both, Dad first of course. But then Nmom had give me a run down of the entire family gossip. She has five sisters, and they are all married and each has at least 2 kids, and some of those cousins are married and have kids also. I'm the oldest of all the cousins, so of course I'm suppose to want to keep track of all this. I don't hate my extended family, but I just don't care about whose kids are doing what sports, hobbies, grades, etc. But it was Turkey Day, so I suffered through it until finally hubby stepped in to help me get off the phone.\n\nBetween Turkey Day and Xmas, Nmom called twice more. I was less accommodating both times, giving her only a fwe minutes before having to get off the phone. When it came time for Xmas, I just didn't want to call. I didn't call Dad either. I just didn't feel up to talking to anyone. I called Dad just after New Years and he didn't give me any guilt at all. Like always, he was just happy to hear from me and excited to tell me what he's up to, which is usually fixing things around the yard or hunting. I never called Nmom.\n\nLast week, Nmom called me to tell me her mom, my Gramma, had fallen and was in the hospital. She suggested I send Gramma a Get Well card. Of course, this is Nmom's idea to do this, not mine, but why not. So hubby picks me up a card at the store, but Nmom was suppose to email me an address to ship it to and forgot. So, a couple days ago, I called her to ask for an address. I was brief, got the address, then got off the phone. As I'm hanging up, I could hear in her voice, either she was sad or distracted. \n\nWas she jealous that her mom rates higher than she does in my Give-A-Shit-O-Meter? I dunno. I keep waiting for the guilt trip to come, or for something to be said. I didn't apologize for not calling at Xmas. I didn't even mention it. I didn't bother to come up with some lame excuse for not calling other than I just didn't want to talk to her. But it was the first time that *I* called *her* since before Xmas. Maybe she could have lied to herself that I just was careless and lost her number again, if I hadn't just proven that I hadn't lost her number. \n\nI'm not caving. I'm still too angry and annoyed with her to give in to the guilt, but it bugs me that I'm feeling guilty. It bugs me that I feel like a heartless bitch because I KNOW it might be hurting her and still refuse to even give a lame excuse.\n\nFor more than a year, she hasn't been able to hurt me. I'm so on to her games, I don't even give her openings anymore. When she tries to goad, I see right thru it and skate on by with a laugh and a turn about goad. It's like....emotional dueling, but she never reveals if I hurt her. She's always been unwilling to show me that side of herself, the side that can be hurt. Even when I was little, she treated me as her adversary, competed with me. \n\nI don't bother to discuss with her that she is LC. She doesn't know that I consider her NPD. She doesn't know that I am limiting my contact with her in a conscious way. I've not discussed it with her. I just give her the silent treatment. When she annoys me, I go NC until I feel she's suffered my absence long enough. \n\nWell, just sharing, I guess. Conflicted and sharing, hoping others will have insight.  \n\n",

It was my Nparent's fault. It was not my fault. \n\nI couldn't stop denying that it was abuse. It was abuse. It leaves scars. It made me blocked out many things of my childhood. It was bad, on the end of the spectrum. \n\nIt's only when I can accept that bad things have happened, that I can recognize the good things in life. ",

        "text": "My little brother called the cops on me last night. It's the same one that I posted about before - the one that uninvited me to his birthday party. I ended up in a Facebook chat with him, asking about the party and he kept asking about how I was...I caved on a bad night and told him the truth - that I was thinking about killing myself (although it was in confidence, and he assured me that he wouldn't tell anyone, least of all my parents). Anyway, the conversation ended. I was pretty angry, and he was getting nowhere. I couldn't buy that whole 'your family cares for you' crap, and I realized that Facebook was getting toxic, so I cut contact with my brother by blocking his messages and deactivated my account. \nThen, last night at almost 3 am I got a call from an unknown number. I had applied for a job overseas, so I thought that might be the call, and hesitating, I picked it up (becuz I really didn't want to talk to anyone at 3am). Well, it was the cops, asking me if I was OK, if I could contact my brother to tell him I was safe, and that I could either call him or they'd come to my door. They were on their way anyway, so I said yeah, you can come, after asking a bunch of questions on whether they'd arrest me, have to file a report, etc. They said no and I waited. So, I open the door and there's these two male cops, with guns, asking me if I have depressive thoughts, think about harming myself, if I have a good relationship with my brother, etc. I was pretty shaky but managed to lie and say I was fine - it was just a bad night and a private conversation. They kept telling me I wasn't in trouble, my brother was just concerned and asking me stuff like that, until I guess they were satisfied and left. \n\nI was so pissed off - I reactivated my FB account and asked WTF basically to my brother, who said that he was worried and wasn't going to apologize, and that he couldn't reach me so it was the only thing he could do...like wtf better than I dunno going to my house? To see me? In person? I live 20 minutes away. Honestly, I was surprised the cops knew my address, because I've lived in my aptmt for a year, 20 mins from home, and they (my Nfam) have never bothered to show up at my door (not that I'm complaining about that). Then I remembered he helped me move (again, a year ago), so I guess he had it from then. \n\nI told him I was deactivating my account and not to call the cops on me again. I've been in this situation before. Whenever I express any feelings, they freak out and call the cops, because 'professionals' need to be called. I just wanted to talk to someone, as a friend. \n\nI was so depressed this morning, I couldn't get out of bed. It's after 7pm now, and I still haven't eaten, so this probably comes across as rambling and shaky, but I'm STILL shaking. I feel so violated. It's difficult to calm down. \n\nI've had bad experiences in the past with my Nfamily making me feel unsafe, then the ensuing response getting me dragged away by a mental health team (when THEY caused the mental health crisis) and it just reaffirms my feeling that they are dangerous and I need to stay away. The problem is that nobody believes me because I'm the 'sick' girl. Ugh. I wish there was a place I felt safe. I wish I could move away again, and then not be told I'm running from my problems. Yeah - all five of them. They're called my blood relatives and I don't want to see or speak to or think about them again. \n\n(EDIT: I just realized the cops could look up my address so they probably didn't even need my brother. Maybe he still doesn't know where I live? Ugh. I wish I was gone from this earth so I didn't have to feel unsafe all the time. I wish I didn't have to live in Hell.)\n\n**Edit** (tl;dr) brother called cops on me because of mental health crisis. Still feel unsafe. Nfamily always makes me want to kill myself, then they drag me away to professionals to get 'help'. Feels like a horrible trap. \n\nI didn't realize how long this was so thanks for reading and sorry about the vent. I'll probably delete this later because it doesn't feel safe posting so much detail, but I have nowhere else to turn. ",

It's bad enough that my husband did this to me and my kids (though not as bad to my kids), but I cannot imagine how crushing it must be to be a victim of a parent and especially a mother.

To make a long story short, about 3 years ago I had had enough of impatience, unkindness, and disrespect and said something needed to change. It only went downhill from there. Last spring he said he wanted a divorce. Inside of begging him to work with me on the marriage and get some counseling, I also began to do some research and play back the previous 19 years in my head. I began to realize he may have a narcissism problem. A frightening realization as it meant little chance of getting him to understand his effect on me and the kids (teenagers). \n\nRecently I've started getting very conflicting information from mutual friends/family. He still loves you, he is still convicted to his vows, he wants to reconcile... He even has our son convinced this is not what he wants And yet when I talk to him he is still completely convicted to divorce and has not changed his language or demeanor about that with me AT ALL. I should mention that he has been the very picture and epitome of patience, kindness, and respect while we've been separated. Why didn't we deserve that in the marriage?\n\nIs this just part of the game? Is it just pathetic of me to still be holding out any hope? This isn't just a bad purchase. This is my marriage and not easy for me to just throw away. \n\nThank you for any insight. \n",

But I can't express how I'm hurt or annoyed or frustrated lest she take offense and accuse me of being too sensitive.

I'm sorry if it's boring or depressing and thank you for reading any of it. \n\nI applied to be a dog walker/pet sitter a couple months ago, and heard nothing until today the woman from the agency messaged me to walk a border collie every morning, near my house for eight days. I've been so angry and anxious and numb, that I've completely neglected almost all my responsibilities, so I didn't reply to the text this morning, unsure of whether or not I'd be able to do it, afraid of the responsibility and just thinking about everything being pointless. \n\nThen, I missed an appointment with an employment agency today and my government unemployment was suspended, even after I called to say that I was going to be late and if I could come in later that afternoon (they said yes), the person I was supposed to see said I came in too late and that I would have to come back again tomorrow. She said she'd already been flexible and I was an hour late - I was supposed to come at 2 and it was almost 3 - and that she couldn't see me at all today. I tried to hide the fact that I was about to cry when she told me this. I had to duck out of the building quickly to find a public bathroom where I just broke down. \n\nThen, when I finally messaged the woman from the pet sitting place back tonight, thinking that at least walking a dog might help me get on a schedule, she said that the job had already been filled and that she'd let me know if there was anything else. \n\nI just constantly screw up. I'm angry all the time. I don't know how much longer I can live like this. If I can't hold down a job, how can I survive? Sometimes I feel like it's better to end it, and I'm just putting it off. I'm away from my parents and NC, but I'm living in hell. I have no friends, no one to support me day to day so I post here. I'm ashamed of my pathetic life. I've crawled to everyone that would help me, from my parents (which obv didn't work) to suicide hotlines, to random strangers. The people that could maybe care I avoid out of shame. \n\nI checked out some books on emotional healing today. I start them - I always do, but lack of concentration defeats me. I just want to run away. What's the use of reading? I spend all my time ruminating, and then when I actually sit down to read a book, I feel like I'm wasting my time, like I don't waste my time already. Living just to survive is no way to live. I can try - I can text people back like that petsitting woman and try to make my appointment, but the anger and the desire just to not fulfill any responsibility -  just to rage and make excuses for the injustice of it all makes me believe I'm a narcissist. I snuck onto the train without paying today. I never do that - I felt guilty the whole way (it was because I forgot my train pass and was trying to get to the appointment at least a little closer to the time) - but I was so angry, just so angry. I can't forgive my parents for what they did - not yet - but I'm beginning to understand. Maybe I did deserve some of it. Maybe they were angry because they saw some similarity in me. Maybe we aren't that different after all. ",

        "author": "kently7",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/5pndai/is_my_cousin_being_narcissistic_towards_me/",
        "text": "There's always been a lot of drama in my family- people quit talking to one another, talking behind each other's backs, etc. \n\nI recently came home after being away at college for a few years. A cousin I grew up with wanted to reconnect, as we hadn't talked in a really long time. Not due to any drama or turmoil between us, but frankly because life just got too busy. So we began to hang out a lot, where we would talk about some personal things- certain insecurities I have, relationship issues I have with my parents, and more. She seemed as if she sincerely wanted to help me.\n\nBut now I'm questioning that. I've learned that I can't be myself around my family- my father has some narcissistic tendencies towards me like favoring my sibling over me, not showing any interest in my goals/life, and I felt as if he had an attitude where I should just fend for myself rather than he help me. He has these misconceptions about me that he tells other family members, which creates an overall misconception about me to the entire family, therefore suffocating my individuality and who I am. I feel like if something goes right in my life, he's never happy for me. And if he is, it's incredibly forced.  \n\nBack to my cousin. Here are some things that caused me to question her:\n\n* I told her I had no problem connecting with other people, whether they be people I meet at work, school, etc (who are normal and authentic people), and she asked why I couldn't be myself around our family. At the time I wasn't sure, so I just shrugged. \n\n* She acts interested and engaged in me when it's just me and her together, but around other people, she treats me like shit. She gives me dirty looks and makes fun of me around family members, specifically her husband.\n\n* I had an emotional breakdown on Christmas due to other family struggles. She and my aunt were the only ones around me when I began to cry (everyone else was in the living room at the family party). My aunt recently lost her husband to cancer, and after my little breakdown, she had a similar meltdown. So the next day, my cousin said something to the effect of how there was so much drama this Christmas. The only \"drama\" I could think she was referring to was my breakdown and my aunt's. Which isn't necessarily drama, since I had such valid reason to have this breakdown, and my aunt just lost her freaking husband to cancer only a few months prior to the holidays. Of course things won't be easy for her, or for me. \n\n* After studying filmmaking, my family believes I'm a film snob. I get the feeling that when I talk about films and cinema they get the feeling that I'm being pretentious and snobby, when it's merely my greatest interest. So of course I'm going to know a lot about it. When my cousin always talks about movies around me, I get the feeling that she's trying to one up me, like she's subtly implying \"Ha ha, I know about movies too.\" She straight up asked me if I was a film snob, and I replied with \"No, but people think that I am.\" She didn't understand what I meant, and I said that I couldn't explain myself any further. I just didn't really know how to explain it. \n\n* One day we were hanging out with her sister (who I have no problem with), and their three little girls. We baked a pizza in the oven and I ended up eating the majority of it without saving much for the kids. I was really stoned, so the pizza looked delicious. When she had seen that I ate the majority of it, she muttered how that was rude of me to do. Yes, it was rude of me. I made a mistake. I used the excuse of me being high for the reason that I ate so much of it. But ever since then, when I show any sign of kindness (like offering her some hot tea that I was making one day), I get the feeling that she thinks I'm being fake and not sincere. I feel like she watches and analyzes my every move and everything I say, to the point where if I do and/or say something she's not expecting, she instantly questions it. As if she has me totally figured out, when in reality, I feel as if she doesn't know me at all despite that we've spent so much time together.\n* When I told her about how I don't eat at a certain mexican restaurant due to it's poor reviews on yelp (people on yelp said that they had gotten toothpicks in their burritos...which is both disgusting and unsafe) she then puts in an effort every time we go out to eat at a restaurant by saying how it got good reviews on yelp, but in a mocking, condescending way. As if I'm being snobby about using yelp. \n* This one is the strangest but it's incredibly vague since I was stoned, but I'll do my best to explain it: when she was driving us somewhere, she was talking about how some people don't appreciate certain things or put in an effort or SOMETHING like that (I honestly don't remember), and I got the impression that she was referring to me. So I said, \"No, those people don't.\" And she replied with, \"I guess they don't.\" but in a really weird way...as if we were both being passive aggressive towards one another. I felt like she was being subtly condescending towards me, and I was subtly standing up for myself. It was weird. \n\nAt her party/bbq she held one day for her new home, I was incredibly quiet and reserved. I could see her across the room talking to someone about how she didn't understand why I was so quiet. But the more I think about it, how am I supposed to be sociable around her and my family? My family have these misconceptions about me that they won't allow me to break free from and she has moments of being condescending and degrading towards me which obviously makes me question her authenticity when its just me and her. Why would I want to engage myself around people like that? And while yes, I am a shy, quiet, introverted person, that doesn't mean I can't socialize. In college, I had the most accepting roommates ever who valued each other and our own uniqueness and individuality. We got along so well because they were normal, kind human beings. The final night together with those roommates, we held a party consisting of a lot of other students I never met. I was confident at that party, because my roommates made me feel comfortable to be myself. I think my point is here is that my family *doesn't* make me feel comfortable. \n\nAlso, when I was discussing how I want to move away to LA, my uncle said \"But we don't want you to leave.\" He didn't say it in a \"We're going to miss you\" way, but \"You're going to do as we say\" way. When I told my cousin how I want to move far away, she said \"You better write us letters every month or really often.\" which caught my off guard. She said it as if I was going to abandon them, as if I didn't care about them. \n\nBecause I'm so quiet around them, they make me feel as if something is wrong with me. But now I'm starting to see the family dynamics and how they're not honest with one another, and that's what catches them off guard: I'm *always* honest with them, but they either reject what I say, or act as if what I said wasn't the right answer. I think they're not used to honesty. \n\nI'm starting to feel as if I'm the family scapegoat. Not in a straight forward, extreme, explicit way, but in a conniving , sneaky way. They don't listen to what I say. They want me to act a certain way. They make me feel like something is wrong with me, and I doubt that they question themselves and ask if they're doing something wrong. \n\nI could go on and on, but my focus on this post was about my cousin. After the night that she mocked me in front of her husband and other family members, I began to really see who she truly is, and who this \"family\" truly is. Since then, I have not spoken to her or seen her. I left the house in a hurry that night, and I think she saw that I was angry/upset with her. So she hasn't tried to contact me since. \n\nI'll be seeing a therapist soon to discuss all this, and more. But from now on, I'm just going to focus on myself and my future. I'm not going to put in any effort with her anymore, it's just not worth it. I don't need that added stress of constantly questioning her and constantly trying to prove to her who I am, where I'm constantly trying to break free of her misconceptions about me. \n\nThanks for reading. \n\n",

        "text": "(warning, long post)\n\nI have been NC from my NM for about five years now, and I have now put most of her destructive behavior behind me. \n\nI no longer feel depressed or anxious, and am increasingly in control of my thoughts and social skills are improving (I am still a bit of a loner but after talking with various members of my father's side of the family that appears to be partly a learned behavior due to my NM and also a genetic one along with a few other behaviors), I have made arrangements to return to University and finish my degree in September as I only need two more classes (without a student loan), I am with another army reserve unit after being put on medical leave and seem to be doing my job well (as far as I can tell), I have a new part-time job starting in a week, I have a new place to live with a better landlord, I have fixed a credit problem I had (UNICEF defrauded me and my bank is now looking into their practices - shocking, I know), I have most of a novel I have wanted to write half done and a publisher is interested in seeing the completed manuscript, I am in better physical shape and am moving to a place closer to a gym, and I have reconnected with some of my family members, and it looks like I can get a full drivers license after a brief refresher class.\n\nThe 'Things to do' lists are getting shorter and less full of critical matters, and it is more of a question of what do I do now? All things are not completely rosy. I live in a bit of a high unemployment area (at least where it comes to doing things that require a university degree), and rents are going up due to real estate being bought up from investors buying up the apartment blocks. It is still affordable, but the rising prices are a concern. But the more I hear of others situation then it reminds me that there is still more work to be done.\n\nTL;DR: I have been so preoccupied with surviving, and then recovery, that now that I appear to be heading out of the tunnel I am not sure how to start 'living' my life. I have lost my twenties and adolescence, the traditional times of identify formation, to my NM. Now that I am almost out it is like shedding a crutch - what am I now that I am not recovering from this psychological mess?\n\nEDIT:I guess the hardest remaining part of all this experience is that I think I have a hard part departing what is familiar, no matter how horrible it might be, for something new and better. I have been working on it for the past year (no choice really) but I still have that urge to cling to the familiar.",

        "text": "His mother is italian, We met when she was studying english at my high school almost 20 years ago. I fell in love with her and chased her until finally she seemed to have fallen in love with me to. We spent the next 4 years going to see each other in our countries every summer and christmas. I'm not rich, I had to work several jobs to afford the plane ticket. Her father worked for Al'italia and got her tickets paid for by him at a discount.\n\nwe lost contact with each other for a period of six years but then she called me out of the blue and wanted to come visit me. I was overwhelmed with emotion at seeing the first girl I had fallen in love with after so many years, but she had changed. There was a sadness to her that wasn't there before. She had been studying in spain and to me it was obvious that something had happened to harden her.\n\nWe didn't see each other until 2009 three years had passed since we last saw each other. I was living in Los Angeles and making good money and had a life, but again she called me out of the blue telling me she wanted to see me. So I took some time off work and went to stay with her. She seemed happier, a little more content with life but still there was something that she seemed to be hiding, a truth she couldn't tell me, but alas my vacation came to an end and I returned to my life in Los Angeles. \n\nIt wasn't until 2012 that we made contact again and again she said she was sad and wanted to see me. She wanted me to come and stay for 3 months so I left my job and I went again to Italy to see her. She told me that she wanted us to be together, to build a life and that she wanted a child. So, we made a child.\n\nBut there was still that sadness, and there was also an ex boyfriend, the most recent who she continued to text with. Messages that read about how they both missed each other. She didn't know that I had read her messages. There were many of them and I found them all after we found out she was pregnant. At first she wanted to terminate the pregnancy and even dragged me to a clinic to talk about an abortion. I pleaded with her and told her I wanted to start a family with her, but I was confused by her relationship and the messages I had read from/to her ex. I didn't have a job in Italy and didn't know how I would be able to provide for my family so I returned to America.\n\nI found a job and was making money and wasn't there for the birth of my son. I took two weeks off in february of 2013 to meet my son for the first time. I also went to the U.S. embassy to give him his american citizenship and passport. I also gave her a bank card attached to my bank account.\n\nThen I had to return to the U.S. and my job and life there away from my family. The girl that I had left all those years I was no leaving my son behind as well. It destroyed me but I had a job that paid well in america.\n\nEventually I left my job to reunite with my italian family and try to find work there and be with them, the girl I fell in love with as a teenager and our son.\n\nIt was only a few days that I had returned to Italy in 2014, just before his first birthday that I learned that the mother of my son was selling her body for sex. I first found out because she was doing video sex chats with men on single sites with a video chat component. This truly destroyed me and all my insecurities came rushing back but I was determined not to leave her again.\n\nShe would lock herself in her bedroom to strip for other men, leaving me with a sick child with a fever of 104 while the thermometer was inside the bedroom with her. She didn't have much interactioin with our son. He would be in the room with her sometimes while she was chatting. Sometimes messages would be on her phone from men to meet, or little kissy emojis that sort of thing.\n\nOne day I came home from work while my mother was visiting and the mother of my son was not there. My mother told me she found her naked in front of my computer so I looked at the computer and found the messages saying that she costs 50 euros and where to meet her.\n\nThis was only 5 months after I had arrived in Italy but I still didn't run away but now I knew her long standing deepest, darkest secret and it was not good. We fought, I would get angry and ask her why she does it but she always lied to me. Tell me that I didn't understand the lanaguage, that it was only chatting. She would try to manipulate me in this way. often the arguments would lead to her hitting me, often times in front of our son.\n\nI put up with it for 3 years until her parents, who we lived with started to join in the fights. My wife stole money from my wallet, took my bank card and took money out and continued to prostitute herself out. \n\nfinally I had had enough. I had no money, I couldn't focus on my job or learning the langauge properly. In fact I learned the language more from reading her sex messages than I ever did from her speaking with me in the language.\n\nSo I left to the U.S. to try to put some distance between us and find work and focus on easing my troubled mind and think about what I should do. I had a return ticket for september 1st, but my wife filed for divorce less than a week after I left claiming I abandoned the family. Now I dont' have the money for a lawyer and am forgetting the langauge and have trouble communicating with my son who was diagnosed with autism. because of his autism his therapists who cost 700 euros a month and was all the mony that I earned  , the therapists told me that I should only speak to my son in italian and not confuse him with english.\n\nSo today is my son's birthday and it is the first birthday of his that I am not there with him. It has been six months since I was in italy and the last months I was there my wife and her parents kept my son from my by taking him away from the city we lived in on weekends, my only time off as I was working and taking night classes to learn the language and driver school classes, and computer courses in Italian to be certified for certain I.T. jobs.\n\nI feel destroyed because my son doesn't really want to talk to me on skype. he pretends to be asleep in the car. My wife won't let me talk to him other than at noon here in US 6 in italy and often times when I call she tells me he is asleep. Or when I call her phone dies after only 3 to 5 minutes of skyping.\n\nBut today is my son's birthday and he is doing better. When I left I told me wife that I had to leave my son to save him. I didn't want him to be closed off or hate his mother for seeing her hit his father and abuse his father. I know we couldn't live together, the mother and me, but I feel so much guilt for having to leave him.",

        "text": "The dynamic with my narc was like from the text book. Adoration, devaluation, manipulation. I am very lucky, I have not met anybody like that the whole life and I find it very fortunate that it took relatively very short time to uncover.\n\nIntially, I was pretty much done with constant gaslighting and I stood my ground and said (not aware of the situation back then) that I can not do this anymore and I am done and if she ever wants to go back, she is welcome (how wrong was I?!),but there needs to be her own initiative to take \"relationship\" to the next level and not just about me giving her attention and she doing nothing for me back at all. Pretty much healthy self care.\n\nI did humiliate her, intentionally, saying her that she is not good enough for me and that I just deserve better and some other sarcastic remarks.\n\nThen the three months passed and she started to hoover. She wanted to go back to me, realizing that it was mistake and she is sorry. Now I see it completely, after I let her go back, thinking she changed, poor me, she started to manipulate right back and I cut her off very, very fast. We did not even meet.\n\nNow the thing is that I told her she is mentally sick and that I know she is complete and utter fake and I see she is playing that and - this is very important - that I am going no contact for another two months.\n\nThe thing is that I said that even I dont know why. Well, I do know. To show her that right now I am the one with control here and I am the one who is going to dictate and control.\n\nBut the fact is that even declared no contact by me is still not the proper no contact because there is this notion of contacting again from my side after time passes and after that she can just play victim and discard me right off the bat to prove herself I am not important to her anymore.\n\nNow imagine this, she is waiting two months for me to be contacted, plotting all that ugly stuff what is going to happen to me, maybe just her complete discarding, but imagine that after these two months, I will not contact her anymore :DD hahaha\n\nDo you see what I did her? One situation would be, for her, to wait two months and shut me down, but completely different situation is to not to provide her any chance to do so - because I have completely forgotten that she even exists. I forgot to get back to her. This is even worse then ignoring \"on purpose\". When implemented properly, it would basically tear her apart very slowly, thinking what has happened that I did not get in touch at all when I said I will and she would be constantly trapped in that situation unable to move on because she is thinking I will do so. But I will not :D\n\nI think the best revenge is not to be vulnerable to cast revenge upon yourself. Because in order for narc to go away, he or she has to \"finish\" you - only after that these people can move on. So the inability to move on, because there was not any closure, even worse, the closure and finish was done by me, uncovering her, taking control, and not contacting her back, is going to make narc suicidal. Just put yourself in his shoes.\n",

The trouble with having dealt with a narcissist is having had your own sense of confidence and self-esteem dealt a blow by someone who put you down and tormented you to make themselves feel better.\n\nThe difficulty I find is that I need to be confident and self-assured to succeed, but at the same time, I have this inner dialogue of self loathing and negative self regard. Having read Albert Bandura and his discussion on Self-Efficacy it really does seem that part of recovery from narcissism is, almost ironically, a sense of self-assuredness and confidence.\n\nMind, avoiding narcissism is highly important, but I do not think self-confidence and high self-esteem is narcissistic per se. It is entirely possible to hold one's self in high regard, while respecting the opinions and the personhood of other people. \n\nWhat do you all think? I feel this may be part of the steps forward, but I would like your collective input on ways to move forward in recovering from narcissism.",

        "text": "Hey All!  I'm an ACoN and an olbie from RBN and LAN.  I usually post under a different username, but this time I need to use an alt for anonymity's sake.  \n\nI was bullied constantly from K - 8.  My abusive parents taught me to be a bully magnet.  I've had some abusive SO's, a few abusive bosses and every now and then other bullies hone in on me.\n\nHowever, it's been a long time since I was bullied.  I have had a lot of therapy and built up a fair bit of self-esteem.  I was starting to feel bully proof...  until my 3 year-old started a new school.  Of course, one of the first moms I met was the \"mean girl\" type.  She was rude to me the first day I met her, but I was stuck interacting with her because my kid is friends with her kid.  Fucking fantastic.  \n\nAfter the first day, I decided to just ignore what happened.  Maybe she has social anxiety.  Maybe she lacks social skills.  I have no idea.  So, I gave her another chance.  During the second chance, she tried to shame me in front of a group of other moms over something trifling.  I can't get into the details.  I will leave it at this... I have told the story to several friends and I've asked them if I was out of line and deserved shaming.  My friends said that the other mom was a bitch.  So, there's that.  \n\nFrom there on, I've avoided her.  I try not to speak to her, but I'm civil.  I'm not rude.  I just avoid.  \n\nBut, she just keeps on going.  She met a friend of mine and she didn't know this person was a friend of mine.  Somehow I got mentioned and the mean mom said something rude about me... she basically said I was delusional.  I've noticed a few of the other moms no longer will make eye contact with me, so I suspect she is smearing me to them.  Then, today, she happened to be talking about my child in front of another friend of mine.  The friend called her out on it.  But yeah, she's still going on about me.  Great.  I'm glad I have a friend on my side who is willing to tell people to stop fucking whispering about me.\n\nAt this point, I think this woman is a narcissistic and I'm her scapegoat.  I was hoping that I'd be able to make friends among the other moms in the class, but I think this woman is going to make sure that I am not able to do this.  I'm not sure why I want more friends, tho.  Maybe I'm being greedy.  I have a lot of good mom friends and I get invited to more playdates and birthday parties than my family can even attend.  Perhaps I shouldn't see this as much of a loss.  But damn, I also don't want her to be able to just target me like this with zero consequences.  I'm sure I'll meet at least one or two more mean moms when my kids go to middle school and I'd like to be prepared for them... so, what do I do?  \n\nI keep having fantasies of eloquently confronting her about this, but I'm not sure this is wise.  She is obviously very experienced at making people look bad and I'd probably just be exposing myself to more insanity.  Everything she does is so deniable, so it will be hard to confront her about it...\n\n\nWhat should I do?  Avoid?  Confront?  Ignore?  Ideas?  \n\nThanks in advance.  ",

        "text": "I haven't posted in a while, thankfully because things have seemed to settle down in my life and going more smoothly.\n\nI have had a relaxing weekend at home and I am feeling renewed and refreshed. It just got me thinking that things are really good right now and I am feeling really good about  myself. For the longest time, I always felt like I had a deficiency in many things at a core level. And while I still sometimes feel that way, it's less now. I have two amazing kids that I haven't fucked up. We finally have them with good care providers and they are THRIVING. I have an amazing husband and, even though he is dealing with some stuff and some stressors, he is always there to smile and love me. My new therapist is exactly what I need right now. I have an awesome job and it's the first time in my life I have finally felt like I am where I need to be right now. I do not feel like an imposter there and that's HUGE. I feel like when people look at my resume (which is everywhere due to a career field switch), I have finally built it up enough that my vast, differing experience is a PRO not a CON. I finally feel like I have a lot to offer and I'm not the weirdo left out. And I like all of my coworkers and LOVE my new supervisor. She totally gets it and has experienced Nabuse too. \n\nSo, I just had to toot my own horn for a minute. I am feeling my self and what I have got going on right now lol So maybe when things shift and I feel low, I can come back and look at this. \n\nSo, I'd love everyone else to join in and toot their own horn. Let me know what you're proud about/is making you feel good/anything positive about you right now!",

        "text": "This is something that I've struggled with since I was very young, but it has, unfortunately, followed me into my next life (that is, grad school). \r\rMy pi/boss/mentor asked me to come talk to him today. I've been working in his lab for 2 1/2 weeks and just completed a complicated procedure yesterday for the first time on my own. He frontloaded his talk by saying what I've been doing right, but then launched into some criticism with the phrase \"I was disappointed...\"\r\rI was not really upset by anything that he said. He pointed out some things that I do need to work on. And yet,the entire conversation, I had to actively fight back tears. This is not the first time this has happen ed. In fact, it happens nearly every time I have this kind of conversation with someone.\r\rIt burns me up because I pride myself as being someone who has great control over her emotions. I don't get overemotional. But something about these situations triggers something from my childhood with my Ndad and just makes me lose it. I hate it. And I have no idea how to stop it.",

Sometimes it also happens if I say my opinion about things that I'm not sure everyone agrees on.\nIt inhibit me in my everyday life, so even if I can't change my feelings or self esteem, I would like it to seem that way so I can say what I mean more often.",

My anxieties are worse than they were in a long time. In less than a month it'll be 1 year of NC.\n\nPart of me wonders why bother? Everything in my life is getting better except me.
