        "text": "A few hours ago I was sitting in a Chipotle eating the only proper meal I’ve eaten over the past two days. I have had some food during that time, but not nearly enough to be considered healthy. It was at a point where I could feel my legs shaking while I was standing in line to order, so I must’ve looked like a wild dog to the restaurant staff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI speak from a place of privilege here, because while I struggle eat food, I don’t really have a problem getting food. My family is paying for my housing and groceries while I’m out of work and finishing up my degree, and I’m able to keep my pantry stocked with things like fresh fruits and meats and whatnot. However, my ADHD makes it difficult to put any sort of effort into eating, so fruits and vegetables will often rot away in my fridge as I consume low-effort foods like bread and candy instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a while, I’d work through the low-effort stuff first then turn to healthier options when I ran out of other things. Surprisingly it worked pretty well, and for a time I was eating the produce I bought before I had to toss it. But lately, I’ll work through the low-effort food and then just…not eat. Social anxiety can make going into public or shared spaces a tricky subject, but even when there’s no one in the kitchen, it can be so hard to motivate myself to put even the slightest bit of effort into preparing food. Thawing meat, microwaving popcorn, even peeling a fucking orange. Everything is too much, so I end up starving myself for days on end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually I snap, like I did today, and go get something premade just so I can start to think straight again. I try to avoid eating out when I can to save money (my family pays for groceries but I’m on my own for food otherwise), but at this point something is better than nothing even if it isn’t the most fiscally responsible. It helps me to think straight enough to try and figure out what went wrong and fix things, which rarely works, and a month later I’ll be in my room having eaten nothing but a combined three tootsie rolls and half a loaf of bread for three days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ve never been in any serious danger because of this cycle, but it’s demoralizing to deal with. I’ve wasted so much food and have no one to blame but myself for it. Knowing that everything is right there for me to perform a basic bodily function but watching as I fail to do it for no good reason. I want to have kids one day, but how am I supposed to take care of them if I can hardly take care of myself?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my first time posting anything like this (potentially posting on this subreddit too) so sorry in advance. I’m open to suggestions, but it’s been a tough week and I really just needed to get it off of my chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I go days without food because I can’t motivate myself to prepare anything.",

        "text": "TLDR: My cognitive processing and memory are a disaster and I need a modern re-evaluation. Do online paid evals work?\n\nI am a 36 year-old female who was diagnosed years ago with high functioning autism and ADHD, as well as a mathematics disorder. \n\nMy whole life I have had massive issues with organization, memory, cognitive processing problems - and problems with my education, despite being an intellectual type who loves knowledge. I have had serious problems keeping up with other people, and even functioning in daily life. As a young adult, my family went a little bit overboard of getting me “help“ that made it worse. It is taken me all of these years just to try to get my life back on track, however, the time that I had spent away has made it even more challenging. \n\nCurrently, I am now in quite an uphill phase in my life. Despite years of fighting and struggling, it is more challenging now than ever before. I’m basically now doing everything by myself, I don’t really have a support system, my family have an abusive relationship with religion, etc. None of my friends are nearby either. I’m more isolated than ever.\n\nOn top of that, the diagnosis was so long ago, when briefly I attempted to get treatment for it with medication, it didn’t go well. I decided then that the ADHD medication wasn’t for me. I am now starting to rethink that, because everything is a total mess now.\n\nWith the current chaos in my life of having to move three times in the past year because of the housing crisis and rent that is too expensive, it’s all been too much. \n\nI’m also experiencing extreme sensory overload. I’m still not really sure if that’s a part of autism or if that’s a part of ADHD. My autism symptoms are very mild, and I struggle with them less than I struggle with the actual learning problems and ADHD symptoms.  \n\nSo basically, I’m losing things constantly, I’m forgetting things constantly, I can’t keep track of anything, I am missing work, everything’s a mess. Important stuff like my wallet, my jacket etc has gone missing for the second time in a row in two years.\n\nI’m just lost in sensory overload and chaos in my head. I need to get reevaluated, because right now I’m only being treated for the autism. There really aren’t any psychiatrists in my area or who take my insurance who are willing to evaluate me, because they’re all booked up for an indefinite period.\n\nDo those ADHD websites who offer diagnoses without insurance really work? I’m just not sure how to move forward. I don’t have access to my old diagnosis anymore, it was well over 10 years ago.",

I’ve also noticed this with other things like getting a massage. The whole massage my head will be somewhere else then when it is finishing up I feel unsatisfied because I wasn’t fully present throughout it.

I've called every mon wed fri for 4 weeks now, and been told no new patient appointments at the facilities that are in network for me. I tried using teladoc through insurance and there aren't any appointments with someone who handles ADHD. I talked to my PCP and he suggested giving something like done a try, but to be wary. He has specifically said he doesn't feel comfortable managing ADHD (I live in a college town, I get it) so this is my most immediate option.\n\nI've done tons of research, I've done the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ASRSv1.1 and am hyper aware that I am not a medical professional. My \"self diagnosis\" is ADHD with symptoms of anxiety. My focus has been atrocious my entire life, I've tried meditation, logging my day in a journal to try to stay focused, things like alpha brain and no success. 9 years ago, I was prescribed vyvanse, hated it and immediately stopped.\n\nI got matched with a nurse practitioner for tomorrow. Based on my research, I think I'd like to try a non-stimulant like strattera or wellbutrin but I'm very open to what has meaninfully worked for people. I dont intend on using done forever, just to get treatment started until I can get into a facility locally.\n\n I wanted to post here to ask people's experience with:\n\n1. Done\n2. Non-Stimulant ADHD treatment",

I don’t want to be a burden but I find it really hard to change and organise myself and the things around me. \n\nI’m anxious people might think I’m an imposter and trying to find an excuse for just being lazy. \n\nMy weight has yo-yo’d wildly ever since I was a teenager.

        "text": "I (28M) have recently been going through a pretty rough breakup. I neglected my partner quite a bit and really began struggling with anxiety for more than a year of our time together. Sadly, I think there are others on here who may relate to the failure of a relationship due to seemingly neglecting their partner. I'm still figuring out how to address the issues that I face regarding my ADHD. I was only diagnosed in October, so a lot of this is still fairly new to me and I'm learning new things about myself and my ADHD every day with the help of my therapist, psychiatrist, and the internet. It's been pretty tough. It's not easy to combat ADHD and anxiety when you've lost a vital support system in your partner. \n\nBut I found a quote from [HelpGuide.org](https://HelpGuide.org) about ADHD in Adults that helped to paint a picture of a struggle I've only recently realized I have dealt with all my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Constant reminders from spouses, bosses, and others that they should “change,” reinforce that they are unloved as they are.\"\n\n[https://www.helpguide.org/articles/add-adhd/adult-adhd-attention-deficit-disorder-and-relationships.htm](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/add-adhd/adult-adhd-attention-deficit-disorder-and-relationships.htm)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis isn't the first relationship for me that failed in relation to my actions that I believe are related to ADHD. I would like to mention that I still take full responsibility for my part in these relationship failures, but that ADHD made it difficult for me, especially without having a tool set to combat my issues. I struggle deep down with criticism that lead into feelings of being \"unloved\" due to the constant little critiques I receive from everyone around me. I realize I have tied my self-worth to being successful and anytime I make a mistake, no matter how little, I feel unworthy of love. I have stopped allowing myself to enjoy or relax on the weekend or vacations for the past 2-3 years and often have found the daily tasks of normal life causing more stress than ever before to where I now struggle to do basic things. Because my own self image is so bleak, I seek validation from others, to the point where the opinions of random people really matter to me. I'm basically journaling here (new strategy I've just begun to use), but I felt maybe some others may benefit as I have from reading this and realizing their feelings of being unloved may be similar.",

Finding out I had Adhd my entire life at age 19 ruined my life. I felt like I have lied to my entire life with no explanation from nobody. I Look back at the past often and think of all the bad stuff that has happened to me that was tied to ADHD but was looked at like I was a troubled kid, which at that time thought the problem was me all these years. I feel betrayed I tried blaming my parents, but in reality, there is nobody to blame but myself. Since then I stopped attending my university and moved back home and working part-time. I have racked up a 4 figure debt from me impulse buying things to finding new hobbies since I am at home most of the time but I lost interest at the end of it all. I should say I was put on medication for both my ADHD depression and anxiety but the side effects were killing me so I stopped completely. My Parents are against medication, they saw the side effects of the stimulants, and the SSRIs were doing to me. I work so little but it feels so unbearable going to work and putting on a fake smile while making such little money. I wasn't made for this world.\n\nI cannot take it anymore I CANT every day my body feels like it will drop dead from how exhausted I am even though I don't do anything all day. I deal with constant thoughts of suicide that linger in my mind all day every day. my chest is constantly feeling tight like I am about to have a heart attack. I have been having panic attacks constantly 2 of them which made me pass out. I used cutting as a way to cope. com It has become hard to even do basic things like brushing teeth, showering, and overall everything): I have lost interest in everything to the point I just lay in bed and stare at the ceiling daydreaming of me dying and putting an end to my suffering. I have started taking sleeping pills during the day so I won't have to deal with my thoughts as I sleep. I feel terrible for even feeling like this, I come from a middle-class Christian family. My parents are supportive but I can tell they just do not understand me at all which hurts even more. I told them I have had thoughts of killing myself but they kinda downplayed it to put it into words.\n\nI do not know what to do I feel too exhausted to even tell anybody which is foolish I know I just don't care anymore I just want out. It's the same day every day. I feel all alone I have been slowly isolating myself from friends and family without realizing it. I just cannot wait for my pain and misery to end. Thank you if you read all this. this and a few other communities have helped me cope with this misery.\n\n**0 CommentsShareSave**",

        "text": " \n\nOne symptom that I feel like no one talks about is feeling tired all the time. You just feel burnt-out. To me, it feels as if I ran a whole marathon, but in reality I've been sitting on the couch for five minutes. This also makes it extremely hard to get work or pretty much anything done.\n\nAnother one is how anxiety is often caused by ADHD. For example: You can't get anything done because you feel tired all the time, but this leads to you not finishing school work. After that, everytime you're assigned school work, you get extremely anxious, as you feel you won't finish it. At that point, not only are you tired, you're anxious as well. It just makes everything worse.",

I would freeze up and my eyes would become glossy. It would become hard to speak. I’d get so agitated to the point I’d just feel nothing at all. And maybe hurt myself. \n\nI was always so confused because I don’t have trauma. Literally anywhere you look online, it says dissociation is related to trauma. Nothing really triggered it. It would just happen in random moments. Mostly at work. \n\nI have a theory that I would become so severely bored and lacking satisfaction that my mind would just leave my body. It’s like I didn’t want to be somewhere or do something so badly that it just happened. I didn’t know why it was happening at the time, but now that I have more dopamine from meds in my system, it is clear.",

        "text": "Over the course of the year I’ve been looking into a lot of things about ADHD, mainly how the brain functions with it. Learning how ADHD deals with dopamine and our reward pathways has definitely opened my awareness on my own ADHD. We constantly seek the stimulation our brains are after and if we can’t find it we could care less about what’s going on in the current moment.\n\nBut something I still question is where does it come from? I’ve read multiple sources that say ADHD can stem from early unresolved trauma in adolescence. When the brain is still developing it’s in a vulnerable state. When trauma, abuse or violence is thrown in it can cause many mental problems into adulthood. But is this the main cause of developing ADHD? \n\nIf the answer is yes, this could make a lot of sense for myself. I can clearly remember when the symptoms of my ADHD came into light at age 16. Around that age I was exposed the darknesses of my parents divorce along with verbal, psychological and rare psychical abuse. I began to crave adult content on the internet around this time to escape reality. This grew into other high dopamine chasing habits such as drugs and nicotine. Today I struggle with social anxiety, depression, insomnia and ADHD. \n\nSo with this said, are there really any other causes of ADHD? I do feel like people that have had less trauma and growing up in a healthy environment seem to be less burdened with mental health issues",

From my perspective, I really like Concerta and am nervous about trying different types of medication, but I'm not opposed to finding something that might work even better.\n* I've heard that amphetamine based stimulants are better for adults as opposed to methylphenidates, but is that true?\n\nPS Also to name and shame: Cigna requires prior authorization for name brand Concerta, even with the authorized generic being unavailable this long. They insist that I try Vyvanse, generic Focalin ER, and generic Adderall XR, and have my doctor send specific medical reasons for why those medications were tried and didn't work for me, before they will even *consider* authorizing name brand Concerta. I didn't have this issue with BCBS at my last job.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions for more info.",

I’ve suspected that I have ADHD for years but never got to get tested because my family didn’t believe in that stuff. But recently I turned 18 and worked up the courage to make an appt with my family doctor to talk about it. I went in, did a quick questionnaire, and then she told me treatment options (which at first I thought was for future reference), and then just told me to pick one. So I picked and she gave me a packet and told me to go pick up my new medication and that we’ll have a follow up in a month.\nNow. The reason I’m confused: from what I’ve gather from my research in order to be diagnosed you have to get a referral to go to a specialist, and go to multiple appointments with the licensed psychiatrist who does full on background checks and everything to officially diagnose you. And I just went to a regular family doctor who really didn’t even ask me the questions herself. But it also says in the packet “For diagnosis: Attention Deficite Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)”. So did I get diagnosed? Did I just get a prescription? Does it even matter?\n(Also if it’s relevent I live in Washington State.)",

I think that psychologists or neurologists can diagnose you but not prescribe the actual medication right?\n\nSo i went to my primary care doctor and he said he could prescribe me the meds, but on the lowest dose possible (5mg) adderall wich didnt help at all. I asked if i could be put on vyvanse becuase that worked for me when i was in high school, so he prescribed it. Ive been on vyvanse 30mg for 6 months now.\n\nToday during my check up i expressed that the vyvanse isnt lasting as long as it should be. Before i could even ask for suggestions, he said \"increasing my dose will not give me anymore bang for my buck\" but i never wanted to increas my dose in the first place. I wanted to try the adderal IRs multiple times a day, or 1 XR, then an IR later in the day because ive seen a bunch of people do that. My vyvanse is very effective for a couple hours, but it sucks when i feel it wearing off way before my day is over (like 1 or 2pm). im not even on a high dose at all, 30 mg. It frustrates me that he wont even let me try something else for a month. Or that he might think im seeking a high, when in reality this is something that i need to function at a normal level.\n\nI think he might have something against stimulant medication, or just not understand that some people really need it. Does anyone think it would be worth it to go to a different doctor that might be more understanding, or the psychologist that diagnosed me in the first place? Do i have to stay with my primary care provider for this? Idk what im allowed or not aloud to do in terms of having multiple providers or doctors.",

The feedback from my employers is that my work is excellent, but I take too long on projects, I turn in work late, and I ignore tasks that I don't find meaningful (entering my metrics into a spreadsheet? Total waste of time. I refuse to do it). I'm a bad employee. \n\nMy biggest problem when performing my work is that I have trouble following oral conversations. Sometimes my mind just wanders when someone is speaking to me, but other times, even when I'm trying hard to listen, I can't remember what the person said three sentences ago. A similar thing happens when I'm speaking. I get lost in the middle of a sentence and I can't remember what I was about to say. Fortunately 90% of my work is written, but that other 10% when I'm speaking/listening is really important.\n\nI'm desperate for help, but I've been misdiagnosed by doctors lots of times in the past. I'm scared that I'll be misdiagnosed again. The worst thing I could hear is \"there's nothing wrong with you.\"",

We dated for about a year before getting married and this is the first time she’s ever lived with anyone else since she’s been an adult. \n\nSince we’ve bought a house and moved in together last year her lack of cleanliness is really driving me to my whits end. She still has boxes unpacked from when we moved in and every time I try to get her to clean up after herself and put things away I got serious attitude and hostility from her. \n\nShe’s also been gaining weight and not trying to work out and honestly whenever she walks into a room it feels like a grey cloud comes with her. She’s been seeing a therapist for a number of years and is on I don’t know how many medications. I’ve tried talking to her about all of these things but nothing seems to change in the slightest. \n\nAt this point I’m seriously considering an annulment of the marriage due to her ADHD issues. Is all of this normal for a non-ADHD spouse to be going through?",

She may have sensory issue relating to feeling dirty due to ADHD/autism/ocd (the status is not known fully yet). So she will often sweep and resweep on sight of a dirty area, then sweep the nearby areas and then sweep the rest of the house. Then she goes on cleaning sprees that last hours and takes time away from my family and I and she often times has anxiety about our 3 year old making a mess and I have to remind her that she is 3 and the house won't often look the way she wants to because of it. She is 29f mother of 2 who works 40 hours a week.  Anyway this isn't necessarily about her.\n\nBriefly about myself I'm a 30 yo father of 2 with ADHD who takes adderal and has stopped take welbutrin a couple months ago. I work around 40 hours in the winter and run a concret plant for almost 60 in the summer. Sometimes I don't even see the mess she talking about or place the same standard on \"organization\" she does. (I quote that because it seems more like outta sight outta mind for her and not organizing) We've been together for almost 6 years.\n\nMe, being fully diagnosed with ADHD (combined) and depression struggle very hard to even try to get on here level and often times her reactions of things not being good enough often make me feel discouraged and not want to try. \nI hear a lot of \"I'm just asking help for the simple stuff, it's just simple what's so hard about that\" and my entire life has been an internal struggle with being unable to do the simple stuff. Ie cleaning up after myself immediately after a task (which may take a few days depending) I'm not usually leaving garbage on the floor or meals on the counter and feel like I've made a lot of progress partially using \"might as well..\" when doing things. But being ADHD it's just a bunch of work around that don't always work and she doesn't seem to understand that I literally cannot will myself to do everything all the time let alone anxiety clean for no reason.\n\nI struggle to express to her that I don't mean to appear lazy and that I suffer greatly when she uses some ableist terminology and even more so when she gets argumentative about it telling me essentially that I fake it. \n\nI need help two fold. I need all the work around I can get for task initiation and everything involving the massive text wall above. I also plan on talking to her about adhd soon and what it really means but I don't know how exactly to conceptualize it with out being confusing or trying to make excuses. I want her help without expecting her to do everything and I want her understanding and less judgement.\n It all sucks and I just feel like a piece of shit",

        "text": "Hi there, I hope this is OK to post, I couldn’t find a huge amount exactly similar to my question. \n\nI started Vyvanse 30mg a month ago after previously being on Ritalin and Ritalin LA with no effect - the first ten days were great, I felt that really subtle shift in the way I felt capable of approaching life. I didn’t feel foggy and incapable after a good night’s rest, I could do the things I wanted to do. \n\nThen I had a bad week - super early starts and late finishes at work meaning not a lot of sleep or rest, not eating properly because of lack of time, a lot of stress and distress at work and in my personal life (some of which I imagine was overegged by the vyvanse).\n\nThen for the past week and a bit, it’s just not had the same effect. I took two days to do nothing but sleep and rest, I’ve made sure my diet was back on track (I’m having eggs in the morning for protein but at the moment not really noticing a huge difference whether I take before or after). I keep sleeping through my alarm because I’m so exhausted even if I’m going to bed at 9:30/10pm; I can’t bring myself to do anything even if I want to; and I feel like I’m back in that world of before where everything is through a pane of translucent glass. \n\nWas the first week’s efficacy just a placebo? Is there something else I need to do? Is it just a waiting game, or do I need to change my dose? I tried to google how long it takes to reset after you mess up your sleep and diet because I know that’s really important, but all I can find is how long it stays in your system and how long it takes to kick in. \n\nI know it might be early days I’m just so scared after years and years of waiting to find a solution I’ve messed it up during a busy patch. Any help would be much appreciated and again, I’m really sorry if I’ve missed where this question has been answered. No one in my life has ADHD that I can ask and I am only allowed to see the psych one or two times a year. Thank you!",

I feel self conscious discussing a lot of these problems with most anyone I know but you guys are always here for me so thank you &lt;3\n\nI am worried about the adderall shortage but have noticed it just is not effective for me (at least now) much anymore. At first 10mg IR was fantastic. Now years later I am on 40mg XR and feel like it doesn't do much, if anything for me. If I knew I would be on this high of a dose when I first started, I would be convinced I'd have a heart attack from it. Sure I could try CBT and whatnot, but I am worried because my meds used to work well. The biggest change I have noticed began a few months ago and for seemingly no reason. I've gained 20 lbs within a few months but take my meds regularly, and my doctor is a little concerned about that. My motivation is zilch compared to the fall. Sure maybe some life things could be part of the issue, but I'm able to nap after taking my meds which is not normal at all. \n\nRegardless, I am curious to try vyvanse but don't want to quit adderall cold turkey in case I do get any withdrawals from that. I noticed if I take a break for more than 2 days I get very tired and feel depressed (or at least what I assume depression feels like).\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. What is the difference between these two meds? What should I expect if I do switch?\n2. How did you switch between these meds? Did you take part adderall and part vyvanse for a little bit or just switched without any transition?\n3. Are there different side effects compared to adderall?\n4. Has anyone had problems with a vyvanse shortage?\n\nI know insurance is an issue for a lot of people prescribed vyvanse but I am hoping my new job will have decent coverage.",

        "text": "Hello everyone! I am a 21M and I am a currently on the track to graduate from university, and I will spend another year in graduate school (I'm a cybersecurity major) and probably either decide if I will stay with my family or move out. I also live in a very robust city, so once I do know how to create music the opportunities to perform are quite amble, but I'll get to that later.\n\nThe problem of course, is that I am just starting out, I have a good voice and I would consider myself quite energetic as a person. Yet, I also sustain myself and my job is that I own an online record store. Not only that, I am quite obsessed with just going on my page and scrolling, while also doing nothing really important for hours at a time. On top of that, I don't have social media, and I don't have any crazy familial commitments, so I have so much potential to really focus my dreams and get to work.\n\nHowever, I am so obsessed with vinyl, and online shopping/selling I spend so much time just doing impulsive and repetitive actions that I am quite disgusted from how I am behaving. I do work a bit, but it is nothing I need to spend more than 30 minutes - 1 1/2 hours doing a day. After that I can spend hours and really break out of my mojo to just randomly check my website, amazon, and eBay pages expecting activity. Whether or not it comes doesn't matter as I just do the same impulsive shit and do it again. I also repetitively check my emails and messages, and it's just a weird cycle that happens so many times that it really disrupts my train of focus.\n\nThe climax of the problem is, I use the remaining 5-6 hours of free time I have in the day (not including eating, chores, and walking), basically just mindlessly scrolling. If I used half of that time daily to really get in on learning music production, I can definitely at least create enough within a year or even the summer to establish myself as an artist, and I really do believe that (else my dreams would feel dead to me).\n\nI rely a bit on my best friend/neighbor who is quite good at music production himself, yet I want to be more reliant on me, as I am still trying to figure out my sound and what my brand will look like. I want to be more efficient, and I don't know how busy I will be after the summer when I may potentially have school projects to work on. The impeding understanding that once I learn music production, that there will be a branch of more things to work on within that field, and then to worry about other things involving my music social media and creativity really edges me. Because of this I guess I get lots of thoughts and worries that I won't be able to achieve my goals, and that the pressure is just going to be a lot.\n\nThis is all, and I don't know how else to conclude other than to ask for any advice or help! I really would appreciate it!",
