        "text": "Write a flash fiction story about 2020.\n\nHere's mine...\n\n---\n\n###Avenatti - A True Friend to the Working Man\n\nA live two-person camera crew chases after our lawyer hero who is now running for president. They are desperate to ask him a question about a leaked story. He tries to escape by taking some stairs. The out-of-shape camera guy is wobbling dangerously. The reporter is in danger as she moves far too quickly down stairs in very fashionable heels. \n\nShe's yelling \"Mr. Avenatti, Mr. Avenatti! It's dangerous to go so fast! Please stop! Mr. Avenatti, Mr. Please! Avenatti! I have a 'right to work' question!...\" The chase continues. She finally manages to corner him at the bottom of stairwell. The fire exit is locked. Avenatti cannot escape. \"Fuck!\" he says very quietly towards the door so there won't be audio and it's not on camera. \n\n\"Mr. Avenatti, I caught you!\" Our lawyer hero turns to the camera with a big phony smile. She continues: \"News has leaked that your campaign has crafted a preliminary federal right to work law to go into effect should you win&amp;mdash;\"\n\n\"That news is incomplete and inaccurate. Totally inaccurate. I have said many times that I support unions 100%. *Period*. Those are the words on all our documents. I support unions 100%. *Period*.\"\n\n\"But I have a copy of your right to work proposal right here. The super-winded camera guy reaches into his back pocket and take out a very crumpled document with \"Avenatti 2020 &amp;bull; TrumpCrusher\" text and TrumpCrusher^tm logo.\n\n\"Is the camera guy okay? He looks like he might vomit.\" The camera guy is not okay at all but he gives the thumbs up sign.\n\nThe reporter says: \"What do you have to say&amp;mdash;\"\n\n\"Are those rats!\" yells Avenatti - not as a question. The reporter turns too quickly and at an angle and a heel breaks. She topples over and bumps her head. She's woosey. Avenatti is overjoyed at his good fortune. \n\nHe stomps on the camera guy's left ankle. He screams in pain and crumples into the wall. The reporter flinches instinctively. Avenatti yells \"A rat just bit your camera guy! Look! There are at least a dozen rabid rats in here!\" She's barely moving her head. The camera guy is glaring at Avenatti. \n\nAvenatti bends down a bit and gets in his face and says with quiet and scary venom: \"If you say what really happened - you fucking worm - I will anally rape you death with a baseball bat. Rats bit you.\" The camera guy is scared but Avenatti stomps on his other ankle as insurance. \"Rats bit you.\" Avenatti instructs him. He howls. Avenatti makes a cutthroat gesture with his thumb across his neck. The camera guys gets the hint and screams \"Rats bit me!\" \n\nAvenatti is now ready to make his move. He lunges at the fire alarm that he realized would be his salvation. He pulls it. Alarms go off. It's deafening in the echoey stairwell. He pushes the emergency latch, the door opens and our hero lawyer is in an underground parking garage. The thick door closes behind him. \n\nHe takes out his cellphone and merely by the push of a speed dial button he informs his crew the proposal was leaked. \"F*uuuuuuuuuuuuu*ck!\" yells our lawyer hero as he tries to figure out how he can get to the surface another way.",
