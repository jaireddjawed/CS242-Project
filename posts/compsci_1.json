We used social media data and [geolocation models](https://github.com/1712n/yachay-public/tree/master/conf_geotagging_model) to find posts about OpenAI, Bing, and Bard in the Silicon Valley and San Francisco Bay Area for the last two weeks to see which one received the most mentions.\n\nFirst, we filtered social media data with the keywords \"openai,\" \"bing,\" \"bard,\" and then we predicted coordinates for the social media posts by using our text-based geolocation models. After selecting texts which received a confidence score higher than 0.8, we plotted their coordinates as company logos on a leaflet map using Python and the folium library, restricting the map to the bounding box of the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley.\n\nWe analyzed over 300 social media posts and found that roughly 54.5% of the time, OpenAI was the most talked about. Bing made second place with around 27.2%, and then Bard came in last with 18.3%.\n\nThe full map is [here](https://1712n.github.io/yachay-public/maps/chatbots/) (you can zoom in and see more specific locations).\n\nOpenAI may be winning the AI race at the moment, but it's not the end yet.

It doesn't have to be straight out of college, but if I had an education and some years of experience and projects under my belt, what could I aim for? I know this varies by person, especially with how broad the field is, but working on projects that contribute more like working on the software of a rover or something that can create a significant impact would be interesting. Just wanted to know any thoughts or opinions.\n\nI know this question would be better for cscareerquestions but you need a certain amount of karma to post on that so trying here.",

Please indulge me to share my personal side project, a programming competition for Secondary school Computer Science students known as [Coding Quest](https://codingquest.io/). This year's contest starts tomorrow! It is 10 days of problems from Monday 6 March to Friday 17 March.\n\nThe original idea was inspired by Advent of Code, but a key difference is it is specifically designed for Secondary school Computer Science curricula such as GCSE, A Levels and IB Diploma. Last year there were over 30 schools that participated and there are currently 90 schools signed up for this year. If you know any teachers or students of Computer Science at the Secondary school level, it is not too late for them to join up.\n\nStudents compete for positions within an internal per-school leaderboard, and additionally each school competes against other schools for a bit of light-hearted rivalry (which school gets to brag at having the most hot-shot programmers?!). The overwhelming emphasis, however, is on the learning experience and maximum participation. Students will be able to download an individualised certificate of achievement upon completion of the event ([example](https://codingquest.io/certificate-example.pdf)).\n\nIt is recommended that teachers sign-in to register their school prior to promoting the event with students. That will allow the school team to be listed and available for students to see and join when they sign up. When you are ready to invite your students, there is a [promotional poster](https://codingquest.io/codingquest_poster_2023.pdf) you can use as well.\n\nSignups open at [https://codingquest.io/](https://codingquest.io/)\n\nI'm happy to answer questions and would love to hear your feedback.\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "I'm a CS professor and lately, my academic email account has received multiple Call for Participation emails from \"IEEE CPS - Computer Science, Computer Engineering &amp; Applied Computing\" CSCE'23 conference. My colleagues noted they got the same emails and were wondering about it so I did a little investigating because their CFP looked eerily familiar.\n\n* First warning sign: their website has a banner for the \"American Council on Science and Education\" which is not an established professional organization like ACM or IEEE.\n\n* Second warning sign: the [conference lists 21 different tracks](https://american-cse.org/csce2023/committees) that span the gamut of CS research areas from Bioinformatics &amp; Computational Biology (BIOCOMP) and e-Learning, e-Business, Enterprise Information Systems, &amp; e-Government (EEE) to Foundations of Computer Science (FCS) and Grid, Cloud, &amp; Cluster Computing (GCC). It doesn't have a concentration.\n\n* Third warning sign: it advertises as \"IEEE CPS\" upfront likely to feign credibility. The fact is that **doesn't mean it is sponsored by IEEE**. CPS is IEEE's \"Conference Publication Services\" where they [index papers published by other conferences for a fee](https://ieeecps.org). \n\n* Forth warning sign: \"Professor Hamid R. Arabnia\" is the chair. From what I can find, he's actually retired. If you're unfamiliar with him, he has gained a notorious reputation for running fraudulent conferences with these same red flags. He used to run [WORLDCOMP which got roasted in this subreddit 11 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/qmf46/worldcomp_the_worlds_biggest_sham_computer/) and a sock puppet account even replied in that thread to defend it with [a copy-and-paste post it had in another one of its four total posts -- all alleging a conspiracy to defame him](https://www.reddit.com/user/truth10000/). Alarms were also raised [5 years ago when he rebranded it as \"CSCI\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/84pdzz/worldcomp_or_csci_are_fake/). In fact, the old WORLDCOMP website [world-academy-of-science.org](http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/) currently redirects to the latest renaming of the conference, \"CSCE\" at [american-cse.org](https://american-cse.org).\n\nAllegations about these conferences (including on the previous reddit threads as well as [elsewhere](https://www.ripe.net/ripe/mail/archives/dns-wg/2013-December/002831.html) are that there is no real peer review happening and it is a predatory conference that just accepts anything and cashes in on registration fees. Many legitimate researchers have complained that they were duped by the conference and when they attended it (always in Las Vegas, as far as I can tell), there were some real research presentations but it was obvious that there was no meaningful peer review being conducted to assure that the research was sound.",

        "text": " \n\nPower BI is a business analytics tool developed by Microsoft that allows users to visualize and analyze data from a wide range of sources. The primary use of Power BI is to provide users with a way to make sense of complex data sets through interactive visualizations, dashboards, and reports.\n\nSome common use cases of Power BI include:\n\n1. Data analysis: Power BI can help users analyze data to identify trends, patterns, and relationships that are not immediately visible. Users can explore data using interactive charts, graphs, and tables.\n2. Data visualization: Power BI enables users to create compelling visualizations that make it easier to communicate insights to stakeholders. Users can customize visuals to meet their specific needs and create interactive reports that enable others to explore data on their own.\n3. Business intelligence: Power BI can be used to develop business intelligence solutions that provide users with real-time insights into key business metrics. These solutions can help organizations identify areas of opportunity, optimize operations, and improve decision-making.\n4. Data integration: Power BI integrates with a wide range of data sources, including cloud-based and on-premises data stores. Users can pull data from multiple sources into a single dashboard or report, making it easier to gain insights from disparate data sets.\n\nOverall, Power BI is a powerful tool that can help users make sense of complex data sets and transform data into insights that drive business decisions.",

As an AI enthusiast, I've spent countless hours researching and experimenting with different AI tools and techniques, and I've come to realize that many people are still intimidated by AI and find it hard to get started.\n\nThat's why I created AITopTools.com - a website that offers a wide range of resources and tools to help people learn and experiment with AI, without any financial incentive or hidden agenda.

This has been a huge disappointment for me, as I'm truly passionate about making AI more accessible and empowering for everyone.\n\nThat's why I'm reaching out to the Reddit community for help. I would be grateful if you could take a few minutes to check out AITopTools.com and share it with your friends and colleagues who might be interested in AI. Whether you're a student, a professional, or just someone who's curious about the potential of AI, there's something for everyone on the website.\n\nBy spreading the word about [AITopTools.com](https://www.AITopTools.com) you'll be helping to make AI more accessible and empowering for everyone, and you'll be supporting a passionate AI enthusiast who's committed to making a difference.

Now, I am considering switching to another field, probably computer science. I started studying computer science on my own a few weeks ago and I like it. Furthermore, I am a logical and reflective person, so I think I could be good at it. The only thing that concerns me is that I am already 21 and have just started learning about computer science. I see children starting to code at a very young age and who already have a much better level than me. I am a very ambitious person and I want to excel in what I do, but when I think that many have years and years of experience ahead of me, I think it is realistically impossible. Please answer honestly, objectively and bluntly if necessary, is it too late for me to start in computer science and programming?",
