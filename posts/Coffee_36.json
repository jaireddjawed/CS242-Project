        "text": "First off, it's important to note that I drank a lot of coffee. From 8am to 5pm, every single day of the week, I was consuming strong (large moka pot-made) coffees. I knew it was becoming a bit too much when I was making a coffee to take with me to the supermarket, DIY store or on a forest walk with my family. Look through our family photo collection and you will see me holding a coffee in most photos ‚Äì no matter the location. \n\nSo I decided one day to go cold turkey just to test myself. The main catalyst was feeling like I looked liked shit all the time (might have been the caffeine, might have been the fact I have 2 kids and am nearing 40). Either way, I felt fine physically (but I was also aware that all I knew was the coffee-filled me). I wanted to know if the caffeine free me was any different. \n\nAfter reading countless blogs I was prepared for feeling like shit, cold sweats, headaches etc. Long story short: it was not that bad at all.\n\n**Week 1:** Super easy. I took up herbal tea drinking (and drank as much of that as I did coffee). No caffeine as it's basically just water. The biggest difference that hit me immediately was I began having super vivid (and different) dreams. They were more like movies than the usual random strange visuals I was used to. They had story lines and locations were new. The kind of dreams that you talk about and make you look forward to going to sleep. I was also super hungry in the first week (as coffee suppresses hunger).\n\n**Week 2:** the worst week of all. Same as week 1 but I could not focus for shit. I couldn't read a sentence in an email without becoming distracted. \n\nI noticed my skin felt a lot more hydrated all the time (if before I would wake up feeling like I had a raisin for a face¬†‚Äì now I had a grape :). My hunger died down but the dreaming continued as did the tea drinking. \n\n**From week 3 onwards** it all became kind of the same. I was drinking lots of tea, feeling hydrated and dreaming deeply. I was going to the gym, which was not unusual ‚Äì¬†but whereas before I would go regularly for a week or two and then fall of the wagon, since quitting coffee I have been going nearly every day, enjoying it and wanting to go more. I cannot say this is directly because of the zero coffee policy but it is likely (they do say you get more energy when you quit). \n\n**Some points to note:**\n\nAcross the full three months I never craved coffee at all. But in the final month I did miss it¬†‚Äì and by that, I mean: tea is boring. It is not like I wake up in the morning and think \"oooh, cannot wait for a big cup of hot water\". With coffee, there is a ritual to it and cosiness it brings. The flavour etc ‚Äì all of that. I missed that and did not get it with tea.\n\nI never felt ill or shitty as many blogs suggested. I also never began \"pooping like a king\" as I had heard would happen. My bowl routines/movements changed but not in a major way. \n\nI think I still look the same but I feel there is a little more colour (blood flow) in my face.",

My first attempt with the Giveroo was with Ethiopian beans. They turned out better than the first method mentioned, but still not ideal. My second attempt, the one I'm writing about, was with Costa Rica beans. I started with a lower temp setting and slowly turned it up to 200¬∞C ending up with a light roast that took about 25 minutes. I tried my best to extend the yellowing phase as I've heard that's what gives the coffee it's sweetness. The end result was iffy at first since I couldn't really smell anything but faint rubbery smell. Expecting the worst, I brewed some of it up anyway and it was surprisingly the best coffee I've roasted. Light bodied with a slight sour taste mixed with fruit and bitter chocolate. I thought it was interesting but pleasant, 7/10. Can someone explain the off-putting smell that doesn't match the taste at all? Do I need to wait a few days before the smell is more pleasant?",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nCoffee newbie here. I recently bought an Espro press (which is basically a French press with a finer filter and the possibility to also use paper filters) and I have a few questions, that I'm hoping some of you can help me with.\n\n(1)\n\nMy understanding was that the brewing mechanics should be pretty much identical to a regular French press, in the sense that every \"recipe\" that works in a French press would taste more or less the same in an Espro press (not vice versa though). Is that correct?\n\nHowever, I've tried a few French press recipes and I always find the coffee very watery and thin and lacking flavour, and I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong or if the two devices are more different than I thought.\n\nMost recipes I see for French press recommend a \\*very\\* coarse grind and something like a 4 minute brew time and a 1:15 ratio. Following this in my Espro, I find the result very boring and watery.\n\nWhen I go to a lot finer in my grind size (12 or 13 on the Timemore C3, which is even finer than what it recommends for pour over and pretty much what I use for my Moka pot as well), I'm starting to like the result. Thanks to the finer filter of the Espro, this is not really an issue. The resulting cup is still very clean. But I'm a bit confused now why everyone else seems to love their French press with a very coarse grind but I need to go so fine to be happy with it (even though I use the same ratio and brew time).\n\n(2)\n\nMy second question is about the Clever dripper. Am I right to assume that (parameters like ratio, brew time, and grind size being the same), the Clever dripper and the Espro press (with a paper filter) would give very similar if not identical results and are basically the same device? Would I gain anything from buying a Clever dripper (other than convenience, ease of cleaning, etc.) if I already own an Espro press?\n\n(3)\n\nI really like the strength and intensity in flavour that I get from my Moka pot, but I sometimes find it a bit too much, too \"sharp\", for lack of a better word. I also like the smoothness and \"roundness\" I can get from a French press, but I find it lacks intensity a bit. I'm craving something that is kind of in the middle of the two. I was thinking that the Aeropress might be that, given that it's both a percolation brewer (like the Moka pot) and an immersion brewer (like the French press) combined. Is that a reasonable assumption?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

Maybe it's been a few bad batches but it made me branch out, and I've found a roaster who makes these amazingly fruity blends with light roasts and fermented beans. They are my first foray into fermented beans and I'm hooked. The problem is they are proving to be a challenge to grind. I have a Bodum burr grinder and a little ceramic burr grinder, they have both worked adequately. I mean they've always seemed to produce the right grind. My first grind with these beans seemed more coarse than I intended, I brewed anyway and now I just don't want to brew anything else, it's that good. It looks a little underextracted but maybe this is what light or fermented roasts are like? The behavior of these beans is different than what I'm used to. They come out almost... fluffy. I have taken to grinding them in the electric grinder, then finishing them in the hand grinder and it at least looks a bit more normal. Is this just how light beans grind? It's a new world to me!",

The beans have to fresh (within 4-5 weeks old), the temperature of the group head has to be correct, the grind size has to be perfect, the flow has to be consistent to get a shot in ~35 seconds. As much as I love the process of making a great cup of coffee, I think this is quite excessive.\n\nWould I have a better time with a semi automatic machine vs the Flair? Probably, but the above variables are still in play.\n\nSo, I'll probably sell the Flair and look to a brewer type machine, back to the trusty aeropress I go!\nMaybe something like the sage precision brewer would be best, as I've started to prefer a longer cup now vs a pure espresso shot.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is the sage brewer the right way to go? Is there something better on the market?",

I decided I didn't have the patience to do the necessary testing to work out what the ideal input amount of water is, to maintain the ideal cooling off slope so gave up on the idea entirely\n\nWhat has stopped you in your mission for the ideal drink?",

        "text": "Hi! I've had a small, handy piston machine for just over a year... I have no idea what happened but I cannot make coffee with it anymore - hot water gets inside the portafilter but not a drop comes out. If I let it run for a bit, it makes a hissing noise and I stop it, and if I take the portafilter out all the water that was running will just spill everywhere. \n\nIs it an issue with a blockage in the machine itself or is it the portafilter?\n\nI ran the coffee machine without putting in the portafilter and water came out so I thought the issue is with the filter - I took it apart and putting back again to see if there is a blockage somewhere in there but with no change :(. Also this happens irrespective of whether I've put coffee in there or not. \n\nI don't know what to do now; I thought about taking my machine apart of I'm afraid I do not understand enough about coffee machines to do that so any help/advice is more than welcome!\n\nThanks :)))",

I also know I take a little over a week to fully reset my tolerance, because I used to take 600mg of preworkout every day for a few weeks and reset it with no withdrawal symptoms.\n\nSo with all that said, should I even bother drinking coffee every day if it's just gonna make me need it to feel normal eventually?",

Bonus points if it‚Äôs also affordable, attractive, and minimalist! \n\nAlso, if there‚Äôs anyone who uses their slow-flow gooseneck for other purposes other than coffee, what has been your experience?
