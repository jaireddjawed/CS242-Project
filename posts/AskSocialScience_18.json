        "text": "Here is a quote from the book:\n\n&gt;\"Women do not decide at some point in adulthood that they would like other people to understand them to be women, because being a woman is not an ‘identity.’ Women’s experience does not resemble that of men who adopt the ‘gender identity’ of being female or being women in any respect. The idea of ‘gender identity’ disappears biology and all the experiences that those with female biology have of being reared in a caste system based on sex.\" - Sheila Jeffreys, Gender Hurts\n\nHere [is a quote from a layman](https://rebeccarc.com/2014/08/04/am-i-cisgender/) that communicates a similar idea:\n\n&gt;I am not permitted to deny that I have a gender identity at all. But this is in itself oppressive. It makes false assertions about the subjective experience of many people – people like me who do not feel as if we have a deep, internal sense of our own gender, and whose primary experience of gender is as a coercive, externally imposed set of constraints, rather than an essential aspect of our personal identity. It forces us to define ourselves in ways we don’t accept (and, as I’m now learning, if we refuse to define ourselves in this way, this is attributed to bigotry and a lack of empathy for trans people, rather than a reasonable rejection of what being cis entails). If “cisgender” were a description of a medical condition, characterised by an absence of sex dysphoria, then I would accept that I am cis. But if cisgender is a gender identity, which it appears to be, then I am not cis, because I do not have a gender identity. I am a woman. But it’s not because deep down, I feel like one. Because deep down, I just feel like a person.\n\nAnother question: Should transgenderism be better understood as a sex dysphoria, rather than a gender dysphoria? I.e. a desire for a change in sexual characteristics? ",

        "text": "Something that goes against the core of humanistic dignity culture. A common complaint from people indoctrinated with humanism is how the losers of a tribe such as jobless lifetime beggars, hardcore career criminals, and other scum of the Earth are expected to be taken care of by the members of the tribe........ But outsiders of the tribe, even if they be honest and industrious, are to be discriminated against and even beaten, murdered, and raped. Even in the cases where outsiders show loyalty to the country or other tribal identity and make priceless contributions, they still are targets of violence. While a member of the tribe can rape and murder dozens of women of his tribe but because he is a citizen of the tribe it will be expected that welfare be given to him in an attempt to reform .\n\nBeing raised under dignity culture and a libertarian, I ask about the basis of this psychology? I don't mean to sound cruel but if we go by logic shouldn't for example say the autistic people who don't make a contribution but are even a big drain on the economy be neglected? While say recent immigrants who are industrious be the one aid is given to? Or to use a religious example why is it ok for Saudi Aristocracy (who aren't involved in politics) to just sit around and eat and relax without being taxed heavily despite their wealth? While infidels who contribute a majority of the Saudi Arabia's workforce get taxed so ridiculously high? In this example, its even the Saudi aristocracy who are using TAX PAYERS MONEY for their lavish partying lifestyle!\n\nI seen posts in the various social sciences in reddit about emotional bonding being an intrinsic part of human nature that requires one to take care of each other because of familiarity. So I am extremely curious about this psychology of caring for people who don't contribute to the tribe while neglecting outsiders with an immense work ethic and follow the rules.",

Using 'social science' as a catch-all to refer to fields with such diverse methodology as experimental psychology, anthropology, sociology, etc. seems about as unspecific as just using \"science\" to refer to fields as diverse as physics and psychology. Just like we have a distinction between natural and social sciences, it seems like there should be some similar distinction within the social sciences. \n\nEDIT 2: Also, I get that a given social scientist within a field is going to be using diverse methods (e.g., experiments and big data), but some fields (e.g., social psych) are going to be primarily using experimental methods.

I do understand and agree with the second part that they probably are more likely to be victims. \n\nIf someone has schizophrenia, and they have delusions and have a harder time separating what’s real and what’s not, wouldn’t those delusions being violent, (like saying that everybody hates that person or wants to kill them) make it more likely that that person will act violently. Or if someone is a psychopath and they have a more difficult time empathizing, in the way I understand, that would make it more likely that a person would commit an act of violence if they like get angry because they don’t care about people. I just think that looking at what the symptoms are for some of these illnesses that it seems more likely that they WOULD be the ones committing the violence. \n\nMaybe I’m being horribly ignorant here, but can someone explain why I’m wrong. Obviously it’s not all mentally ill people, it’s probably a very small percentage,  but people are talking like it can’t possibly be mentally ill people and that just doesn’t make sense to me ",

What is really unusual about the current global bubble is that it is hitting everything at once -- from stocks to art, fine wine and bitcoin. Driven by record low interest rates and a surge of global liquidity, my composite index of stock, bond and housing valuations is at a record high, higher than 2000 or 2007.\n\n&gt;The result is that while the total worldwide value of stocks and bonds was about equal to the size of the global economy in 1980, it is now 3.5 times higher. Traditionally, economists have seen markets as a reflection of underlying economic trends, but now they are large enough to dictate those trends. The tail could wag the dog: a disruption in markets could come back to bite the real economy. As the market goes up, people feel richer and save less, which means they are not as well-prepared for a market-induced economic shock if it comes.\n\n[Reference](https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/digital-detox-bitcoin-and-other-trends-for-2018-by-ruchir-sharma-1796917)",

Part of the reason there are so few low-income students at elite\ncolleges like Stanford is that smart, low-income kids don’t apply\n2. This phenomenon is partly driven by a lack of exposure,\nconsistent with other evidence on neighborhood effects\n3. Low-cost interventions like informational mailings can close part\nof the application gap\n\nand another section made mention of social networks and exposure to different people, mostly the educated and their offspring, help in getting children and teenagers to view college and higher education differently.\n\nMy thought was how social media, if at all, is helping to expose the youth to diverse cultures and higher educated people which would influence their college attendance and future earnings.\n\nOn one hand, I could see it as children are forming social circles among people like themselves which may reinforce negative ideas about higher education; but on the other hand, there's also the opportunity for, let's say a high school sophomore, to talk to someone on  the other side of the country and form a positive set of ideas about  higher education. In short, if mentors are missing, could social media help fill in the gap?\n\nIf I wanted to look up academic articles about this idea, what keywords or databases should I use? Or podcasts, journals, ect.?\n\n***\n\nPersonal disclaimer: I've no children myself so no clue what social networks they're using or if there's any K-12 version of college-level MOOCs that are popular.
