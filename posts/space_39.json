        "text": "Wouldn´t it make more sense if the spacecraft were more specialized?   \n\n\nLook at all other kind of vehicles humanity has come out with.   \n\n\nCars, trucks, small trucks, buses, trains, all kind of propulsion, all sizes, colors and smells.  \nShips, sail ships, coal powered ships, electric shee.. ships... (sorry), diesel, nuclear, long haul, short haul, icebreakers, oil drilling ships, aircraft carrying ships, human passenger ships, container carrying, gas, liquid, grain carrying ships.  \nAircrafts ... well .. you got the idea.  \n\n\nWhy do we stick with the same spacecraft to leave Earth´s strong gravity well, maneuver in LEO, make a maneuver to leave Earth´s orbit, enters lunar orbit, land on the Moon. Take-off of the moon, leave its orbit, reenter Earth´s orbit, reenter Earth´s atmosphere and land?\n\n  \nI propose a fleet of different spacecraft, each of them better suited for a specific task. Much like we do with other kind of vehicles :  \n\n\n* Earth Lifters-&gt; reusable boosters capable of dealing with most (if not all) Earth´s gravity well and atmosphere. \n* Earth Landers -&gt; reusable capsules capable of reentering the atmosphere and landing (preferentially like a plane), like Dream Chaser, Dragon Crew, Dragon Cargo, Starliner. \n* Orbital tow ships -&gt; pushers, pullers, automated, to tow satellites, orbital stations. These tow ship would be equipped with vacum optimized engines and fuel/propellant tanks. These tanks should be made in orbit, so they won´t require the structural resistance for dealing with Earth´s gravity thus being optimized for holding the fuel in the microgravity. They would be parked in LEO and serve the space infrastructure and be of many different sizes and capacities. Small to push around nanosatellites, big enough to push a space station. Whomever needs a push, just hail a Uber-Rocket on the app. Charges by delta-V times total mass of the customer. \n* Cruisers -&gt; Long haul cargo and human passenger spacecraft optimized for long duration, interplanetary or interlunar flights. The emphasis of this kind of vehicle should be the way it stores and supports its cargo, being it human (life-support equipped) or any other type of cargo that need specialized containers. Much like we have ships for containers, for fuel, for gases, for liquids, for grains, etc. \n* Pushers/catchers -&gt; Powerful engines with huge fuel/propellant thanks capable of pushing the cruisers into their trajectories toward far away planets/satellites/deep space stations. The pushers should be able to return to their launching stations after the cruisers reach the trajectory. Upon arrival at the destination, the cruiser should rendezvous with a local catcher that will be in charge of bringing the cruiser into the destination orbit. This pusher catcher thing could operate as n relay. A pusher going from Earth to Mars while a pusher comes from Mars to Earth exchange. Just like the tow ships, the pushers will be kept always in orbit, never to fly in any atmosphere.  \n* Then we would have the specialized landers. \n   * Moon Lander -&gt; With rocket propelled landing. We can use mass drive to put them back into Moon´s Orbit \n   * Mars Landers -&gt; just like the Earth landers but optimized for a complete different flight in a complete different atmosphere/gravity.\n   * Mars Lifters -&gt; just like the Earth lifters but optimized for the low atmospheric pressure and gravity of Mars.  What do you think?\n   * Elsewhere landers/lifters -&gt; For instance, landers/lifters for Titan and its dense methane atmosphere would be completely different.\n\nA trip to Mars, for instance, would be much safer if we send the pushers, lifters, landers before hand. A cruiser would meet a Mars Orbital station that were sent long before the human crew arrives.",

We were in contact with another aircraft that was also looking the same thing. They also were with 3 people in the cockpit.\n\nWe were flying at coordinates S30W60 and when looking at heading 210 from that position we started to see from 3 stars up to 5 stars. These stars were the lowest in the sky and they were going really bright and then dimming. They also seemed to be moving. They were making like triangles. That’s what we all 6 saw. This was all at 0328Z. We saw them until we got into the smoke in Santiago  at almost 0435z.\n\nBefore everyone asks, our phones weren’t good enough to take pictures nor video. The stars were too dim.\nWe did not report them as we would probably be under investigation.\n\nDo you guys know if there was a launch 🚀?  Or satellites doing something? Or something like that?",
