        "text": "So I go to D&amp;D Adventures every week at my local game store. If you don't do them they are sort of professional/public 5e games. You sign up for it, and there's a small fee each session, some official paperwork from Wizards, and it's open to everyone.\n\nAs we are walking our monk pulls out his drake costume. Basically last session we killed a young drake, he skinned it, and using an amazingly lucky disguise check used it to trick dragon cultists that he was actually a dragon (and yes we laughed a lot about it during that session).\nHe did it as a joke this time, but our DM still has us roll our perception checks to see how good his disguise look. Our half-orc gets a 1, and completely believes there is suddenly a dragon next to him and runs off screaming wildly and swinging his sword because he thinks it is a surprise attack.\n\nIn other games this might have been a 'lol' moment and then we would have moved on. But no. Not this game.\nMy Paladin was raised by dwarves, and has had a prejudice against him since the very first session. So now I see the orc running around screaming with his weapon out. So naturally I start yelling \"THIS IS IT, he's finally letting the bloodlust of his people get the better of him! PUT. HIM. DOWN.\"\n\nAnd then....things get real. I try to persuade the party that I am right (the monk believes me, the wizard doesn't, the rogue pretends to believe me because he wants his loot). I knock out the orc from behind while he is flailing around, I thought it would give him a chance to say something but I crit and he's down in one.\n\nWe drag him into the dungeon and figure when he wakes up we can question him. He wakes up and is SO UPSET to be in a cell he screams out and breaks down the door. CLEARLY NOT THE ACTIONS OF A SANE ORC.\n\nHe rushes outside and we see him screaming in the courtyard (we wanted to move on at this point so we metagamed a bit that he would come out and talk to us), but the rogue was going to check on him and trips him out the door.\n\nRogue gets a 19, orc is down in one again. So now I sit on his chest and put my sword to his throat. I want to cut off his head to stop this from happening again. I go into a monologue about the dangers of orcs so that the orc has time to revive. These are the following rolls he got to wake up, a few minutes between each, in order of appearance:\n\n2, 1 , 4, 2, 1\n\nThe DM's face is in his hands, my voice is hoarse because I am running out of things to say to keep my character from killing him. My persuade check to kill the orc is a 17.\n\nEven the wizard has run out of excuses for the orc because we just saw him break out of prison, instead trying to talk about all that we have been through together. His persuade check is a 6.\n\nThe monk doesn't know who to believe and instead turns to his knowledge about orcs to see what he knows. Gets a 3. Only knows what we are saying and I have persuaded him.\n\nThe rogue is busy counting gold that he found on the orc but takes pity and tosses us a healing potion to revive the orc.\n\nI roll a 2. My dex modifier is -1. The ground must have better dex because it caught it really hard.\n\nBy this point the other DM's are at out table (multiple games are run at once during D&amp;D adventure night), because they are done and we haven't even done the quest yet. One is digging his fingers into his face to stop the laughing, another's mouth is just open.\n\nWe give the orc ALL our inspiration and eventually his eyes flutter open. He just needs to say ANYTHING to calm us down and we can FINALLY go on with our quest. But he thinks to be safe he needs to get the paladin's sword away from his neck, so he rolls to push me off because I don't notice he is awake.\n\n1\n\nBut the DM's start a whisper that spreads through the room. \"The dice know\" \"The dice know\". The managers hand comes out of nowhere and sits on our DM's shoulder \"The dice know my friend. Always.\"\n\n.....there is an orc head in my inventory.\n\nThe End.",

        "text": "There's a game that me and my friends play during game nights after a few people have left, and our session is force-quitted. Our GM made the system himself, and we call it *Espionage*. It plays similar to *Fiasco*, except with more improv, stats, and chaos. Yes, more chaos than Fiasco. The first time I played this game with my friends has gone down in our history as \"The Great Moscow Fuck-Up of 1954.\"\n\nThe Plan: We were CIA agents in Moscow in the early cold war. We had to attend a party in an upscale museum, where we would plant bugs, bombs, and kill four Russian officials. \n\nThe Team: \n\n*OP: Argyrios, the \"hacker,\" or as close as one could get in the 50's.\n\n*Raven, the Femme Fatale.\n\n*Estelle, the Con Artist.\n\n*Thomas, the Muscle. Also GM.\n\n*Germaine, the Sneak Attacker.\n\nThe story will be told from each of these characters' perspectives, switching back and forth as necessary.\n\nHow it went down:\n\nThe team arrived in their hotel across the street from the museum. The CIA had made sure the whole floor was safe, and we discussed our plans. Tension was clear amongst everyone from the very outset. A higher-up who remained anonymous, told us of our plan. We were to kill two military leaders, a politician, and his wife, in order to prevent Russian incursion to the USA. Afterwards, we would check bugs set during the operation, to make sure we were not caught. We had four days to prepare. Here's what happened as soon as the intro was over.\n\nArgyrios set up a telescope to check out the area surrounding the museum. Raven went to the store to purchase gowns for her and Estelle. Thomas and Germaine honed their skills in fighting. The infiltrators, Argyrios and Estelle, made fake ID cards to gain entry via the front door. The preparation was complete, and the team was ready to try their hands at espionage. \n\nRaven's scene came first. She came up behind the museum, and seduced two guards. She convinced them to let her in, so they could, as we put it... \"Go to pow town.\" She went inside with a pistol attached to the inside of her hip. The guards were prepared for some not-so-guardly behavior. Raven began taking off her dress... and then rolled two 20s and shot both of them in the head. She took their guns and uniforms, and began to go outside the room. \n\nThomas and Germaine were waiting idly in the hotel room in order to strike when appropriate. This doesn't seem too bad yet, does it? Now comes the \"Fuck-Up\" part. \n\nEstelle and Argyrios were in the line to enter the party. Estelle under disguise as a socialite, Argyrios as a reporter. Estelle passed her bluff check, and managed to make it into the party. She was almost stopped for her scarf, which secretly contained a garotte wire. Nevertheless, she succeeded. Then Argyrios Fucked Up. His first mistake was making up a name, instead of using the list of approved media correspondents. He was immediately stopped at the door. Then the two bouncers out front recognized him as \"that guy that was watching us from across the street.\" They dragged him into an alley, and started throwing punches. Argyrios had a suitcase of bombs, bugs, and a pistol, like the gun from *Goldeneye*, only far less powerful. After failing multiple rolls, he finally killed one of them, and the second was furious. Argyrios nearly died, if it wasn't for Thomas swooping in and killing the other guard. The two attempted to hide the bodies, but failed miserably, as one was incredibly drunk, and the other had multiple bullet wounds. Thomas ran, trying to be sneaky as possible. Argyrios tried to get across the street, but was immediately hit by a car. He was saved by an ambulance, which then started taking him away.\n\nMeanwhile in the museum, several gunshots were heard. Nobody knew where they came from, and so everyone panicked. Raven escaped, and so did Estelle. Estelle was never seen again, as she went into hiding immediately after. Raven stole a car, and immediately headed for the border.\n\nArgyrios, with his dying action, decided to ditch the briefcase in the street. He then bled out in the ambulance. Someone immediately picked it up, alerting the police. After all, nobody just carries around weapons casually.\n\nGermaine and Thomas are now in the pandemonium of the museum. They make their way upstairs, and manage to kill two of the targets. They run to the roof, and jump over onto the hotel. The two grab as much of the evidence of CIA involvement as they could carry. They start heading down the staricase, when the SWAT team arrives. They down a few of them. Eventually the duo recognize they won't be able to escape with their lives, so they light the bombs they brought, and blow up half the hotel. Their bodies were never identified. \n\nRaven is the sole survivor of this horrendous tale. She got to the border, however had not come equipped with a passport. The security officers there broke her bones, and she dispatched them with barely enough life left in her in order to drive away. \n\nThe CIA is thrust into years of shame, leading to a split universe where the US lost the Cold War. \n\nThe dice didn't roll in our favor this time. What a shame. Nevertheless, much fun was had. ",

        "text": "So back in high school (2000 - 2004) I would regularly play 3rd Edition DnD with a 5 of my friends.  I was the Dungeon Master and the other 5 played characters.  The party consisted of a Half-Orc Barbarian, a Half-Elf Paladin, a Gnome Wizard (Illusionist), an Elf Rogue, and an Elf Ranger.\n\nOnce the players had reached level 5 we stopped playing pre-fab campaigns and begun playing a custom campaign I created. (Nothing against the pre-fab campaigns, they are fantastic, I just had a story I wanted to tell)  The plot of my campaign centered around a Human Wizard who had teamed up with a powerful red dragon to eradicate the world of the other races.  The Dragon hated Elves and Dwarves since they had pushed her out of her home and killed many of her offspring.  The Human hated gnomes since their inventions were causing many people in the world to not rely on magic as much anymore (Gnomes were tinkers and inventors in our world.)  The eventual end game would have been for the PCs to attempt to stop the Dragon's assent to Godhood.\n\n(I know it wasn't the most original premise, but we had fun playing it.)\n\nOver the course of the campaign the players did quests to free captured people of different races, look for magical items that they would need to fight bad guys, and did favors for different leaders in an effort to forge alliances between the different kingdoms.  \n\nFinally the players had reached about level 18 and were finishing up the second to last quest in the campaign story line.   At this point the Elf ranger had gathered 2 Owl-bear animal companions, a Griffon mount, and an Eagle that he used for scouting.  The Ranger had several rings that granted invisibility once per day, a cloak that granted a large bonus to hiding, boots that granted a large bonus to move silently, gloves that gave a bonus to lock picking, a necklace that gave a bonus to listening and spot, dragon scale armor that helped his AC and gave him a decent spell resistance, a bow that dealt frost damage and had a chance to freeze opponents solid, a sword that dealt fire damage and had a chance to catch the opponent on fire, and a flute that, once per day, he could use to call a random animal or magical beast to come fight for him.  In addition to that he had a small fortress in his home forest that he funded so a small army of elves would be able to defend his homeland.  On top of all that he had the usual stash of scrolls, potions, wands and other minor magical artifacts and weapons.\n\nAt the end of the last quest the PCs had rescued a couple elves from an evil human wizard (Not *the* human wizard, one of his underlings) who was experimenting on them.  They messed up a couple times during the quest, which resulted in them not being able to rescue them all.  \n\nThis event caused the Elf Ranger to snap.  He decided that for the elves to survive all Dwarves, Humans, and Half-humans needed to be killed.  In the middle of the night he mounted his Griffon and left, leaving a note explaining his intentions and that he let them live because of their past relationship.  The remaining 4 adventurers tracked him down to a town that the Ranger had killed the leader and had set ablaze (He tossed lit torches from the back of his griffon onto the thatched roof).  He had taken up temporary residence in a small hut at the outskirts of town.\n\nThe Rogue was the one that found him in the hut, but the Ranger heard her as she was leaving.  The resulting short fight ended with the Rogue being frozen solid.  Since the rest of the party didn't find the Rogue in time, she died.  That player then re-rolled a Rogue 2 levels lower than the one he lost (our house rules penalty for dying).\n\nAfter an, in game, week the PCs eventually tracked the Ranger down again.  This resulted in a fight that caused the Ranger to take a lot of damage, and lose 3 of his animal companions.  The Ranger fled, and the party was unable to find him (the only one with a flying mount besides the Ranger was the Paladin who had a Pegasus).  The party settled down in the woods for the night.  \n\nThat is where we ended the play session for the night.  During our next session the guy who played the Ranger couldn't make it, so I had the party start the final quest to stop the Dragon from becoming a god.  They did succeed there, but the Human Wizard did make it into the portal and ended up becoming a minor deity in the pantheon.  After that session I went home to begin planning the next phase of the campaign, figuring the Ranger would come back apologize and they would unite against the new enemy.\n\nWell that didn't happen.  The next week everyone was present for our game, and the party wanted to find the Ranger.  The Ranger had gone back to his homeland and talked his people's leader into closing the borders of the forest and taking an aggressive approach to protecting it.  When the party arrived to seek help from the Elf Leader they were attacked at the border.  They could have fought their way past the border guards, but opted to retreat in the hopes of finding a more diplomatic means to talking to the Elf Leader.  While they rested for the night, the Ranger came to them.  The Ranger got lucky with the dice and managed to put the one standing guard to sleep.  After a few move silently checks, he quietly killed them all.\n\nAll the players re-rolled characters so now we had an Elf Ranger (the antagonist), a Dwarf Fighter, a Dwarf Cleric, a Dwarf wizard, and a multi-class Dwarf Sorcerer/Ranger.  The group tailored their feats, skills, and spells to best combat the Elf Ranger.  Their back story was that they were assembled by one of the Dwarven Kingdoms to help defend the Dwarves from the increasing hostilities by the Elves.\n\n(I should note that we didn't do prestige classes.  It was a decision made by us as a group.)\n\nThe Elf Ranger had the advantage, he was higher level, had **all** the magical artifacts that they had gathered over the past couple of years, and had a small army at his command.\n\nOver the next couple of play sessions the party of Dwarves made no attempt to find the Elf Ranger.  The party began gathering intelligence on the enemy, and started trying to forge an alliance between their Dwarven kingdom, a rival Dwarven Kingdom, a Human Kingdom, and a Gnome city state.  Those side quests had the players running all over the map.  The Elf Ranger began forging alliances between his homeland, and three other Elf Kingdoms.  The Ranger also made a temporary alliance with large tribe of Ogres.  In exchange for the Ogres' help, the Elves would help them take over a large island populated by humans, and allow them to live there peacefully.\n\nFinally, after two months of playing, the Dwarf Party began to hunt for the Elf Ranger.  They caught up to him just as he opened the gates of a large city, allowing an Elven army to storm the city.  The Dwarf Party entered the city and split in two.  The Cleric and Sorcerer/Ranger went to help the humans repel the Elven attackers, while the Fighter and Wizard went to flight the Elf Ranger.  In the brief battle the Elf Ranger killed the Dwarf Wizard and then took to the air on his Griffon.  He began firing ice arrows at the Dwarf Fighter, but was forced to retreat when a barrage of arrows struck him and his Griffon.  The Dwarf Cleric spent the battle healing human guards and warriors, while the Sorcerer/Ranger closed the gate and magically sealed it.  This lead to the slaughter of the elf forces inside the gate.  The Elf army pulled back and began setting up a siege.  The party took their fallen Wizard to a local cleric who resurrected the fallen hero. \n\nEnraged by the loss, the Elf Ranger took to the air that night and rained vials of alchemist fire upon the city before flying off to lead an attack on another city.  The party spent the night helping put out fires and healing wounded, the magic users did not get a chance to renew their spells before the Elven army attacked again at the break of dawn.  The Elven army overwhelmed the city, but the party was able to escape by sailing down the river in a rowboat. \n\nThe next couple of play sessions reverted back to the party forging alliances and the Ranger leading attacks against cities.  At this point, though, the alliances were beginning to pay off.  The Humans and Dwarves were starting to meet the Elven armies in the field and win more battles than not.  The real tipping point came when the dwarven party heard about a Green Dragon that lived near the Ranger's homeland.  They ventured down to the Dragon's lair, with emissaries from two Dwarven Kingdoms and several Human Kingdoms.\n\nAfter several, real world hours, of negotiation with the dragon they reached an agreement.  In exchange for the Dragon's help in destroying the Ranger's Home Forest the Dragon would get:\n\n1.  Full control over the forest after it was done.\n\n2.  The neighboring Dwarven Kingdom and Human Kingdom would never harvest wood from the forest for as long as the Dragon would live.\n\n3.  The neighboring Kingdoms would not hunt in the forests again.\n\n4.  Should anyone poach game in the Dragon's new forest, the Dragon could kill them without fear of reprisal from the Kingdoms.\n\n5.  Each Kingdom would pay tribute to the dragon in the form of gold once a year, and livestock twice a year.\n\n6.  The Dragon would allow wizards access to his forest for one purpose; to discuss and learn magic from the dragon. (I portrayed the dragon as an old lonely soul.)  In exchange for the knowledge the wizard would bring or craft a magical artifact for the Dragon.\n\n7.  The Dragon would allow the Dwarves and Humans to cut a road through the forest so that they could trade.  Anyone **on the road** would be allowed to pass through the forest without the dragon attacking them.  If they ventured off the road, they would be fair game.  The road would also be tolled.  Upon entering a toll keeper, on either end of the road, would collect one silver coin per wagon.  The tolls would be delivered to the dragon every full moon.\n\n8.  No elf will step foot in the forest again.\n\n9.  Any other Dragon that the Green Dragon allowed to live in his forest would have to live by the same agreement.\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the Dwarven armies began an invasion of the Ranger's Homeland while the Human armies prevented the elven armies from returning to reinforce it.  With the Dragon's help they killed, or forced every elf in the forest into exile.  The Dwarven Party did not take part in the invasion, they resumed their hunt for the Ranger.\n\nWhile the invasion was happening the Ranger continued to help his armies to take over other cities, and had no idea that his homeland was destroyed until after it was done.  \n\nUpon learning of the destruction of the Ranger's Homeland, one of the Elven Kingdoms withdrew their army and reached a truce with the allied dwarves and humans (the only real contribution the gnomes made was to build the siege engines for the human and dwarven armies).  The remaining hostile elves met the allied humans and dwarves for one final battle, which none of the PCs were at.  Surprisingly, despite being out numbered the dice decided that the Elves won.\n\nThe Elf Ranger tracked down the Dwarf Party after he learned about the destruction of his homeland.  He attacked them on the road by raining arrows upon them from his griffon, so they retreated to the woods (not the forest controlled by the dragon, a different one.)  The Elf was forced to fight them on the ground.  Using his rings of invisibility he approached them unseen.  After his first attack his invisibility wore off and the fight was on.  They exchanged blows for several rounds, but eventually it was clear that the Elf Ranger would not win.  He attempted to go invisible again, but it was dispelled by the Dwarf wizard.  They finally managed to kill the Elf Ranger a few rounds later.\n\nThe final act of the Dwarven party was to broker a peace between the remaining hostile Elven Kingdom and the Alliance of Dwarves and Humans. Despite winning the last battle of the war, the Elves knew they couldn't win the war, and feared that the Green Dragon might be brought in again.  They agreed to cease all hostilities and return to their Kingdom, but refused to take in the refugees from the Ranger's Homeland.  The Elven Kingdom then closed their border and would not allow an elf to venture past their border, or anyone to venture into their forest.\n\nThe Dwarf Party then returned to their kingdom and retired.  Since we were going to start a new campaign, in the same world, I handed the DM reigns over to someone else.  We all rolled new level 1 characters; A human barbarian, a half-elf rogue (me), a dwarf fighter, a gnome wizard, and a halfling fighter.\n\nAfter it was all over, the guy who played the Elf Ranger said he planned on turning evil from day 1.  He just needed a trigger that sent him over the edge.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2g155n/penelope_the_good_succubus_part_1/",
        "text": "And so it was Penelope wandered off across the face of France oblivious to the change that was about to come a few weeks later. When the change happened, it was like any other day, minus the fact that suddenly she was thrown 1400 years into the future, but no one in France could have known that until they wandered off to the other continents.\n\nA few days after the change, as Penelope wandered the land wondering when her grand adventure would come, she happened to come close to ƒÇrajƒÉ‚Äôs former companions. One had just killed himself by trying on a cursed hat (if he survived his will save [he had three chances to roll higher than a 6] he‚Äôd been able to live forever). Shortly after his death, a sudden storm rolled in. Penelope saw a bolt of lightning strike a hillside near her to which she quickly took refuge in a cave close by. \n\nBy the time she had reached the cave, the rain had poured so hard that she was soaked. She began to ring her skirt out and do her best to dry herself off. She even met a peculiar creature that looked like a common luggage, but it had many feet on the bottom that it walked upon and lagged a velvety tongue out of it‚Äôs mouth as though it were a dog. She called it Box Puppy since it was friendly enough.\n\nIt startled her to hear some voices enter the cave. Feeling oddly shy, she commanded the Box Puppy to hide while she tried to sneak around a corner. Due to a bad roll and the fact it‚Äôs her shod hooves against rock, the new comers easily heard her move away.\n\n‚ÄúHello?‚Äù 3 voices called out. For Penelope, the gig of hiding was up. For me, it was time to introduce my ridiculous character to the group. So Penelope came out around the corner with a winning smile and responded with a warm ‚Äòhello.‚Äô\nOne of the party members was overly enthused to meet Penelope, working the sweet talk immediately. The PC was based off the One Piece character Sanji. However the NPC Tiefling saw right through Penelope‚Äôs disguise and called her out for being a succubus. Sanji wasn‚Äôt convinced, but the other NPC and player were hesitant about friending the ‚Äògood‚Äô succubus. \n\nAs the newcomers debated about whether to trust or kill Penelope, the succubus confessed she hadn‚Äôt a clue what they were talking about. She told them that she was an Elf and that she was encouraged to stay disguise since people wouldn‚Äôt like her true look. The Tiefling bantered further saying it was because she was an evil succubus. So Penelope dropped her disguise thinking the Tiefling was wrong. Sure enough the whole party took a few steps back.\n\nMeanwhile, the storm was still raging outside and to force the party to work with Penelope, let alone explore the cave further, the cave entrance suddenly crumbled, trapping everyone inside (thanks DM).\n\nAfter realizing we, as players, only had one way to try and escape, it became evident the party was then stuck with the succubus. Sanji was optimistic about Penelope and her ‚Äògoodness‚Äô. He wore a cloak that was enchanted with Protection from Evil. He walked right up to her, took her hand and kissed it. Penelope totally loved the attention. However, the Tiefling, Kedra, was less than impressed. She began to vie with Cortanna (a half elf) and the Gnome NPC, Melinda, that clearly the succubus was working her charms. To that, Penelope exclaimed that if she was truly evil (which she wasn‚Äôt) that she could have easily killed everyone right then and there. She then presented the scythe as though no one had noticed it already.\n\nShe then turned on her hooves and marched down the cave. As she marched off, she could hear the 4 beings follow after her. She commented that it seemed ridiculous that they‚Äôd follow her if they thought she was evil. Of course that was directed more toward Kedra.\n\nThere was another moment when Sanji and Penelope exchanged introductions to their creature friends. Sanji had a penguin named Gunther. The penguin, they will later discover, has an unhealthy habit of destroying glass bottles.\n\nWhen Penelope saw Gunther she was reminded of the creature she met and called out hoping it‚Äôd return. Sure enough Box Puppy appeared near instantaneously by her side. Cortanna exclaimed, ‚ÄúLuggage!‚Äù upon seeing Box Puppy. It was quickly established that the creature that Penelope had found belong to the PC that committed suicide nearly an hour ago. \n\nThe party warmed up somewhat to Penelope as they continued through the cave and encountered non plot related fighting. The succubus was able to kill a handful of goblins and destroyed an ooze due to a natural 20 (and good timing on the d20 too. That ooze was taking forever to kill!). \n\nThey then encountered 3 Braxats at the exit to the cave. Sanji turned into a huge hydra. The player of Sanji clearly was having too much fun with his wizard. We made easy work of the creatures, Penelope critting one of them for a total of 95 points of damage! The fight worked it‚Äôs way outside into the warm summer air. The only mishap we had was Melinda going rogue on us due to failing a will save. She eventually returned, apologizing for trying to kill Cortanna.\n\nCortanna then explained to Penelope and Sanji (he being the replacement for the character who put on the cursed hat) that they had to go back to Rehm, the nearby town, to explain that the animated object problem had been fixed. At first she offered for them to come along, but Penelope reminded her that she was large and had a huge scythe. Actually it came out more like, ‚ÄúWow! Do you think the people won‚Äôt be weirded out by me!?‚Äù and for the half elf to look at Penelope and rethink her offer.\n\nWith that, the three women took off saying they‚Äôd come back in a little while, Sanji opting to stay with Penelope. \n\nThe succubus was able to convince the wizard to take his shirt off since he was dressed for winter. It was surprisingly easy. They then basked in the sun while they waited. About a half hour goes by when a flying equestrian animal flew up to them and loudly shouted, ‚ÄúYOUR PEOPLE NEED YOU!‚Äù\n\nBoth Sanji and Penelope say up right and looked at the strange creature before replying in unison:\n\nSanji: Yes! I know!\nPenelope: My people exiled me...\n\nThe thing is, the flying equestrian was that of Cortanna‚Äôs. They had seen her with the creature when they first escaped the cave, yet we chose to have our characters take the words literally and not in the context of our new party members being in trouble.\n\nThe creature fluttered about a moment or two, equally confused, and flew off. Sanji and Penelope eyed each other for a moment and shrugged before lying back down on the green grass.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED\n\n[Penelope's Introduction](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2fl48f/penelope_the_good_succubus/)\n",

They were ready to raid and pillage. I am one of those men. We all grabbed heavy weaponry and set out to conquer this nation. We found the nations of Sweden and Ireland. Turns out Sweden was on their way to give a peace treaty to old Ireland. We shot both men and signed our names onto this silly note. Realizing they would soon come back, we fled into Ireland. We held them up, asking if we could stay for a while. They nervously obliged. We hid in a tiny house of theirs. We soon heard some Irishmen getting shot up outside of this house, so we ran out and showed him some Irish power.\n\n\nAfter we murdered a few Swedes, the Irish leader ratted us out, and said we had no affiliation with them. We soon showed him not to rat us out and get us all demoted. We shot up every living thing in the nation of Ireland. With blood stains on the wall and cheers going around... We had finally done it...\n\n\nWe were the new leaders the nation of Ireland. \nAnd we got banned.\n\n(edit: some errors)\n\nHope you guys enjoyed this, Ill even leave a link to the video of this all happening if anyones interested.",

        "text": "\n https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwsr0_kEk2VbZi03WElhTVhPdW8/edit\n\nWe kinda missed a week.  Last week was a short session wherein we hunted the Fat Elf.  Our ork was missing (all we‚Äôve been told about it is that he was doing Pirate Business.  I‚Äôm not going to ask.)\n\nSo I opened the session by interrupting the GM.  Risky, but if you can pull it off it can lead to excellence.  I called the boys and summoned them to a war council.  They were to find the fat elf.  Then I was going to kill him.  Messily. \n\nThe GM tried to fight back with a phone call from a Mister Johnson we‚Äôd worked with previously.  I gently and politely informed him that we _should_ be available in 24-48 hours, and we‚Äôd love to take his job, and what number could we call him at?\n\nAnd then I cleaned up on my negotiation roll and the GM got to suck it :)\n\nElliot got busy and Crumbles backed him up on the Matrix.  We made a field trip back to the strip club, for closer access to that joint‚Äôs systems, and started hunting.  The boys had to sort through a whole goatload of data, but they were able to track down our prey.  We followed that lead, but weren‚Äôt able to turn it into a physical location. \n\n(IRL, I was half tuned out at this point, since in-game I was just sitting guard.  SR5e has _not_ solved The Matrix Problem).\n\nI was starting to get worried, but doors started opening and firewalls parted before their inquiries.  Elliot was _in_  the commlink of the Fat Elf!\n\nWell, I wanted to convert this joker into Chunky Salsa, but the plot thickened as soon as Elliot dumped a copy of his link down and we dug into it. \n\nThis little piece of crap was into the Los Angeles Mob.  In a big way.  The script was gonna be produced by a fourth-rate movie house and the profit was gonna make him square.  Well, we couldn‚Äôt have that.  \n\nElliot did the needful to the file, and we rang the Fat Elf on the commlink.  I could barely restrain myself from howling and growling at the guy, but we put the fear into him, and he was sweating profusely when he dropped the call. \n\nSo, we left a databomb, making the script unusable.  Terrified the elf.  And we made more than the original contract on selling the script ourselves.  I could go to bed happy with that. \n\nSo I did.  After I moved the couch, which was leaning against the door when I got back to my doss.\n\n(Well, Crumbles did.  The poor daft bastard IRL has some problems with his sleep cycle and he was literally losing coherence as we went on.  We tried to do some scouting for the next ‚Äòfull‚Äô mission, but just couldn‚Äôt make it past Crumbles, so we kicked his ass to bed)\n\n\n\nThe next day (The next week, with all hands on deck, rested and ready to rock), we extracted the mission from Mister Johnson and started scouting.  This was going to be interesting - it was a stealth mission.  We were supposed to take the cylinder he‚Äôd given us and swap it for another cylinder.  In a Renraku facility.\n\nThankfully, it wasn‚Äôt that difficult - the facility was owned by a smallcorp, and Renraku had a lease on the top floor.  After the catering gig went off so splendidly, the service contracts were the top of our minds.  \n\nAnd they were a dead end.  The building owner handled internal security themselves, housekeeping was dealt with by robots, and the fifth floor was blocked off from all of that.  \n\nThen we get stupid.  We can‚Äôt come up with any other ideas, so we go off to a Soybucks and..   \n\nHack Renaku.\n\nElliot is a pudgy little decker who has yet to use his old rusty AK to any great benefit to the party.  He is convinced that he doesn‚Äôt pull his weight and isn‚Äôt any good.  He‚Äôs wrong, and what he did next proved it to me now and forever, and cemented his place as my second favorite party member (after my trollish self).\n\nHe pulled it off.  He penetrated Renraku‚Äôs host and gained access to the files indicating that that building was leased by Renraku, and was used for ‚ÄúResearch &amp; Development‚Äù.  Then he got out, and survived the experience.  He lost Baby Monitor on the way, so he had no clue what his Overwatch Score was when he jacked out. \n\nIt was 38.  At 40, Grid Overwatch Division (the acronym is not an accident) locks your link, fries your brain, and sends gentlemen with no perceivable sense of humor to retrieve your meat for reuse.\n\nSo, yay. \n\nWe pull out of the Matrix and chew ideas around the table.  Nobody‚Äôs got anything except some half formed covers and updated breaking and entering gear.  We decide to scope the building in person and note that there‚Äôs another five story tall building right next to it‚Ä¶  \n\nWell.  Welly welly well.  I mosey up to the top of a nearby parking garage.  Two stories isn‚Äôt enough to look _down_ at the top of our target, but it‚Äôs enough to get a gander at it.  The maintenance shack for access to the elevator equipment, HVAC stuff‚Ä¶  It‚Äôs right there where I need it to be. \n\nAnd the plan falls together.  We assemble our gear and wait for the opportune time.  Darkling hour.  2am.  The glow of the city lights is like fire in my veins as we park the ride in the garage and make our way to the seclusion of the alley between the two buildings. Making sure there‚Äôs no cameras covering us, we use grappel guns and batman (Bat Troll!) our way onto the roof.  \n\nHotentote barely has time to ask what the next step is before he‚Äôs flying through the air.  He sticks the landing, and avoids the incoming Crumbles Fastball.  Elliot makes the trip safely, and I manage to avoid turning my ankle as I follow.  Crumbles goes for the lock on the penthouse, and manages to break it.  \n\nPlan A is out the window.  Fortunately, we _do_ have a Plan B.  Plan C would be problematic, so I hope we don‚Äôt end up there.  Knock Knock comes down, and the door is swiftly and messily forced open.  We pack into the penthouse and Elliot goes to town on the local grid.  \n\nElliot hangs out in the Maintenance Hidey Hole, a tidy little officer chair/microdesk/old porno magazine place with a microfridge. Very nice.  On the assumption that he can take care of the camera logs, we‚Äôre through a hatch and into the fifth floor.  Renraku has this setup as a very open plan, with smallish offices lining the outer wall.  Crumbles begins looking through the right side, checking the small cleanrooms there.  We hear a noise, and me and Hotentote move to the left to confront.\n\nA pair of lizards with big staring eyes.  I feel my legs and arms stiffen and I angry through the sensation, forcing my limbs to smash the monster in its ugly fuckin‚Äô head.  The damn thing bites me, and I smash it off me and crush it‚Äôs lizardy ribcage.  I shake the sensation off and turn to find Hotentote frozen in place, staring at his assailant.  I make short work of the second lizardy sumbitch,  and Hotentote snaps out of his stun with a grunt.  He begins hacking chunks of the basilisk off with a knife, and I go to implement the rest of Plan B.\n\nElliot pwned the local system, and has covered our asses from the cameras.  Which is good, because Crumbles found the target cylinder, and can‚Äôt figure out how to door.  Elliot hits the door and I hit the spray paint.  ‚ÄúREMEMBER THE ARCOLOGY‚Äù in big ass letters across the walls, ‚ÄúFUCK RENRAKU‚Äù on another, and liberal application of anarchist signs and crudely drawn penises.  \n\nElliot pops the door and Crumbles ducks into the target room.  It turns out to be a cleanroom, and he stuffs himself into a disposable clean suit and waits out the disinfectant spray.  Out in the open area we‚Äôve proceeded to smashing and breaking.\n\nCrumbles punches a button and the target is released from the machine.  He puts the replacement in and punches the button again, and the machine takes the fake. \n\nOut of character, there‚Äôs a moment of held breath until the GM announces no alarms or codes.  Elliot bounces into the local net to confirm, and we‚Äôre outta-\n\nThe elevator dings and the local security goons step out.  Eliot and Crumbles bail out to the roof, and Hotentote and I go to follow.  A burst of autofire from a subgun thumps me in the back, and I hurry the pace.  Hotentote‚Äôs not gonna be able to climb the ladder fast enough, so I grab him and toss him through the hatch.  Up the ladder I go, and onto the hatch.\n\nHotentote pulls a pocket welder and runs a bead on the hatch while I stand on it.  Elliot has the car leave the parking garage and head towards the alley, and as soon as the weld is cool enough to hold we run for the roof edge.  Hotentote gets flung first again, then Crumbles won‚Äôt get in the armor bag, so he goes next.  I strap Elliot to my back, and make a leap.\n\nAnd biff it.  I‚Äôm clinging to the edge of the building with my fingertips, our decker on my back.  Hotentote throws a physical barrier spell under my feet, and that lasts just long enough for me to get ork nose blood all over my face as he hauls me back up to the roof.\n\nHoly crap.  Five stories.  \n\nWe batman back to the alley and pop the stick on the stealth rope.  As it vaporizes itself we pile into the car and.\n\nDrive away carefully and quietly, in the opposite direction of the Knight Errant dudes, who are pulling up to the target building in large clots.\n\nAnd we‚Äôre away and clear.  When we get back to the doss, the couch is in the bathroom.  We set it right and celebrate with beers, then call Mister Johnson.  He drops us a time and location stamp, and the handoff goes off without a hitch.\n\nJust another day in paradise.  I ordered a _very_ fancy suit, and a new hat.",

Within certain areas, PvP was enabled, but was typically frowned upon. One such are was surrounding the low-tier spawn point, and was accessible to all tiers. Because you got their head when you killed someone, spawncamping was somewhat common.\n\n A few such spawn campers were equipped with enchanted diamond equipment and were collecting heads for their trophy room. Suffice to say, no-one liked them.\n\nNote that, within the game of Minecraft, all armour has durability. Diamond armour, the highest tier, can last about one thousand hits. Enchantments can improve that. Diamond swords, with sufficient enchantments, can kill an unprotected person with a hit and a bit of fire damage.\n\nBecause of a ethereal storage system called an ender chest, I had access to a lot of wood within spawn. What this meant was I could equip the ten or so people low-tier scrubs being spawncamped with wooden swords. Once they met their inevitable death, I could do it again. And again. So, of course, I did. \n\nWhat this meant for the spawncampers was that, after about half an hour, they suddenly found themselves with broken armour, worn out swords, and inventories full of heads so that were now so common they were worthless.\n\nPeople didn't spawncamp bottom-tier spawns after that.",

        "text": "My first Rogue Trader game was GMed by my SO's friend of 10+ years. I tried to be friendly with him, but he always seemed to treat me slightly differently, slightly worse than everyone else around even before this.\n\nI had played a campaign of Rogue Trader with him for nearly a year before I quit out of frustration. My GM started targeting me and trying to punish me every single session because he felt my character was \"overly violent\". Literally every session he would try and plan some \"gotcha!\" moment for my character, trying to back her into a corner where she would be forced to \"reform\" or die.\n\nIt all started because my psyker, Terra, got backed into a corner one session and was completely unarmed facing a man with a gun who was actively attempting to shoot her to death, so she mind controlled the man into committing suicide to save herself. She had never even fired a gun at this point in the campaign, never killed anyone, just basically served as support for the rest of the group who regularly did things like melt the limbs off enemy combatants, shoot them full of so many bullets that their bodies exploded spraying the battlefield in blood and gore, etc. My GM seriously stopped me after that session and gave me a talking-to about how I needed to stop playing such a \"violent\" character. I had a kill count of 1, versus dozens under the belt for everyone else. Nothing was said to any other players, who celebrated these kinds of actions. He got upset at me because he felt I should have made my character remorseful for her actions, instead of playing that Terra felt nothing about his death because it was him or her.\n\nIt escalated from here. He forced us into a Hunger Games-esque battleground where we had to fight 10v10 against other groups for a prize. Everyone else was geared for ground combat, heavily armored, big guns, one guy even had a car with a laser cannon mounted on it. Terra was squishy with almost no armor, her gun had 1/4 or less the range of everyone else's... she couldn't even get close enough to people in combat to shoot them. Instead, she hid in a corner and blinded people with her psychic powers while the other characters picked them off one by one, narrowly avoiding death round after round as the enemies magically knew *exactly* who to target and where she was on the battlefield at all times. He would ignore the laser cannon car, the guy who could literally shoot 16 bullets into a single target in a single round, etc and instead would send us entire group of enemies with basically anti-psyker grenades/weaponry and no other weapons... I was the only psyker in the campaign. \n\nI got sick of this, and eventually was forced into essentially powergaming in order to even have a shot at surviving, because it became really obvious every encounter we entered was designed to kill my character. My GM would up the ante to a ridiculous amount every session, so I had to outdo him just to make sure my character didn't die. \n\nEssentially, we were in an arms race.\n\n\nIt's really hard to sum up almost a year's worth of escalation in a single post, so I'll skip to the session that finally made me quit.\n\nWe had to mount a full frontal assault on a temple that was heavily guarded by a trained military unit. At this point, Terra had basically hired a personal honor guard consisting of a dozen dudes *just* to have a shot at making it through each campaign. She seriously could not kill anything manually on a battlefield. She didn't have the weapons, she didn't have the armor, she couldn't even defend herself so she had to hire it out. The only real power she had were her psychic powers, which at this point were *very* well developed (despite my GM being stingy with my XP and being generous with the rest of the group). \n\nWe get to the temple and the first thing we encounter is an *invisible sniper who has orders to ignore everything else and kill Terra*. Terra is almost certainly going to die. We can't see the sniper, can't tell where the fire is coming from, our cover is seemingly inadequate. There are enemies all over the battlefield, closing in on her. Except... due to a technicality in the item the sniper is using to be invisible, and the way Astropath Transcendent eyesight works, *only Terra can see the sniper*. She is able to use her psychic powers to control the sniper's body and starts picking off the enemies around her, clearing a safe area for her to hide. The other characters are all working ridiculously hard to clear the field, and eventually we get down to the last few combatants. \n\nSuddenly, they retreat into the temple. Our party is confused, but happy we have seemingly won and are safe... when suddenly, we are faced with 3 tanks, an APC, and a giant anti-aircraft gun at the same time. They all start bombarding the field in fire, concentrating on... you guessed it, the corner where Terra is hiding. Nevermind that the entire rest of the group is huddled in a different corner and could be killed in 1-2 shots, nope. Everyone goes after Terra, as usual. She managed to mind control one of the tank leaders into firing on another tank, wreaking havoc and leading to 2 of the tanks plus the AA gun being destroyed (along with the personel running them). Our resident orc blows the APC up from the inside, and the rest of the party combines their efforts to destroy the third tank.\n\nMiraculously, we all survive. We head into the temple, which wound up having the most disappointing climax ever. Tensions were high due to the stress of the battle and literally the entire party broke out into an argument. It devolved so badly that another player stood over me as if he was about to hit me, and kept putting his hand up in front of my face (inches away) while telling me to shut up. I obviously got upset (who wouldn't with multiple  people screaming at them and making physical moves at them?), and took a break to calm down. After the fact, I was footed with 100% of the blame for the argument (which involved 5 people) and my GM sent me a long condescending rant about how I only got upset and took a break to make people feel sorry for me and that I was trying to use my emotions to manipulate the entire party into doing what I wanted.\n\nI never went back. I actually wound up unfriending him on FB, steam, and everything (as did my SO). We both stopped speaking to him. We haven't seen him yet. It took him about 6 months to even notice at which point he sent me another friend request on FB which was promptly deleted.\n\nI'm relieved to be done with him.",

We were sent to camp Halthor in the western mountains of Gaea, where we begin our training so that we may be sent into the battle.\n\nFor the sake of time, I'm going to skip the training and get right down to the good stuff.\n\nAfter we finished our 6-week training course, we are sent, almost immediately to the front lines. Our regiment was split into six different squadrons of four people, I was squadron leader and K, L, and R, were members of my squadron.\nWe were sent, on a carriage, to the port city of Welethor, Which was a vital trading post the Rebellion needed for trade. Once we arrived, we were given an order by General Murikh, an orc with fists larger than his own head, to assist the Assault. Easy-peasy.\n\nWe arrived on the front lines of the battle at early morning, the sun was rising in the horizon, and the tension was running high.\nAt about early noon, we get the order to charge. and we do so.\n\nI was the first one to find an enemy, a sword-wielding guard. I could tell by the way he handled his sword, that he had little experience with it. I fired a musket round into his chest, dropping him. Behind me, L was taking flakk by two armed guards, who were closing in on him. Me and K managed to save him by charging the guards and impaling them on our bayonetts. However, while we were distracted, another guard got an hit on me. R shot him down as soon as he struck me, however, so that was good.\n\nThat's how the battle went on, We charged forwards, taking on an occasional city guard. By the end of the battle, All of us were heavily injured, but on the plus side, we drove the guards out of town. We headed to the tavern, where we rested, healing our wounds, for three days\n\nAfter that, We were given another order. Apparently, the rebellion needed reinforcements about 90 miles east. We were supplied horses and rations for the journey, and by mid-noon, we were on our way.\n\nWe made about 30 miles the first day. On the second day, we came across a small cavern...\n\n\nThat's all for now, Part three coming up soon.",

He's down but he's nowhere near out, folks! So the Yuan-Ti gets pissed and decides to hulk-smash us. Problem is, I'm still on the back of the dragon. I tumble the fuck off of there as the monster smashes the dragon for 136 combined damage. The dragon and GR both lost a turn so TMF and the Dire Bear trade more blows, as that motherfucker crits AGAIN. \n\nOh shit, TMF ain't looking too hot. He's at 17hp now. Kiss our beloved fighter goodbye, folks! So he nopes the hell out, while I hop back on the dragon's back and provoke the Yuan-Ti with a throwing dagger. An attack combined with a bluff works against his Sense Motive as he rains down another hulk smash on the poor lizard. GR finally comes to and runs to the nearest wall, taking a potshot at the dragon and missing it. God damnit GR! Dragon is now very pissed at Yuan-Ti and has forgotten all about me. \n\nThe dragon turns around and tries to bite the monster, but Mr. Yuan ain't having any of his shit today. He *picks up* the dragon and fucking throws him at the wall towards a recovering GR. Dragon thankfully misses by a hair and is now stunned. TMF sees an escape and takes cover behind the stunned soon-to-be carcass of the dragon. Dire-Bear has a freakin' hard-on for TMF, as he charges right into the slightly-recovering dragon. Cushioned of the blow by the White Dragon, TMF takes another 5 damage. \n\nYuan-Ti is now pissed at me. He tries to bullrush me, but I skillfully dodged it, saying \"NYAAAHH\" as I did so. Seeing as I was effectively alone against this guy, I did the only thing I could do. Many Shot  called shot to the eye. Out of four throwing daggers, one crit and took out an eye. Oooohhoho shit, Yuan-Ti is pissed off even more. I run back to the bear and hop on his back while TMF struggles to push his way out of a dragon and a really pissed off bear. GR finally gets his shit together and Coupe-de-Graces the dragon, effectively killing it. God *damn*, GR! Nice! So I hop on the bear's back and take another called shot at the Abomination's eye. \n\n19 YISSSSS.\n\nNow blind, the Yuan-Ti flails around killing the Dire-Bear in the process. He runs himself into the wall, making an absolute shit-storm for himself as he does so. With more throwing daggers, magic arrows, and the goodwill of TMF, we put him down. \n\nMore to come, folks! That was the end of this night's session. Everyone involved is suprised that we made it past that room despite the giant fuck-up by yours truly. So, either tomorrow or a couple days I should have a few more stories for you guys! ",

        "text": "Hello everyone! I've got another amazing story for y'all that will probably be split up in a few parts. Our cast tonight is:\n\nGR: Not so Generic Ranger, but we'll keep calling him that. \nTMF: TankyMotherFucker, fighter. dude fights with gauntlets and gives very few fucks.\nAnd ya got me, Aesir.(a.k.a Pyrogue) General skillwhore and sneaky backstabber.\n\nOn to the story! The DM narrates how we come across a giant temple that is entirely square.(and also designed to *break* us) Two wasted teleports and some architectural knowledge later we find ourselves at a door. This door had a stone basin in which we had to deposit blood. It took us 45 minutes to figure this out. We could practically hear the DM facepalm over Skype. \n\nSo, one door down, what's next you might ask? Marshmallow fluff-land. Every step we take will rebound us at double the momentum. So who thinks of the absolute stupidest way of getting through? Yours truly. I roll for a tumble as I jump in there full force and bounce around off of the other door, which sends me flying back out the entrance at 41/75 health. Oh yeah, we're all level 10 at this point with all sorts of magical stuff, btw. So in trying to dodge the human cannonball that is DipshitRogue, TMF and GR jump into the center of the room and get flung 6ft from the door. I jump back in and miraculously survive right behind them. So, what about this door you may ask?\n\nIt's made of the same stuff with a slit going through that's rapidly closing. I toss a throwing dagger through but I botched the roll so it starts flinging around the room. Good thing I enhanced them with Returning. TMF decides he wants to rip the door off the hinges. Cool, except for the fact he can't reach. A balance check, another botched dagger from our good ol' pal GR, and brute strength win through and we pass through the door. \n\nNow we're at a room with three half-dragon statues. So I do the absolute *dumbest* thing I could do along with my ranger bud. I take some universal solvent and pour it on the dragon's head. GR also takes two flasks and tosses it at the other statues. The three dragon heads explode due to a destroyed pressure cap (oops) and start diluting the entire area with lava. Hrmm. Must have forgot something.\n\nOh right, Pyrogue! You forgot the *fucking exit!* So with our attention finally directed to that, we all rush over in a damned panic. With lava encroaching our real-estate GR decides to scoop up some lava with..... a bag of holding. I didn't realise the danger immediately until our friendly DM warned me what would happen if he ruptured the damn thing. Lacking any viable option to open the solid-steel door (used all the solvent to get us in the damn mess) I grab him by the shoulders and toss him into the door. \n\nBy now the lava is approaching FAST, so TMF, GR, and I all start ramming the door with all our might. Temperature increasing, no dents, lava getting closer. Fuck. Keep ramming, crit fail by GR as he slips and slams into the door with his head, knocking him unconscious. Fuuuuuck. We keep ramming it with our shoulder, and I pass out from heat exhaustion. *Shit!* We have 4 rounds left. On the fourth round of christmas my DM gave to meee, a door shattered like a little... bee. TMF barrels through the door, the impact knocking him out. We're still boned as lava is upon us.\n\nDM: Roll a fortitude save..\n\nGR: 9\nAesir: 11\nTMF:24\n\nThank the dice gods, TMF came to and dragged our sorry asses through the doorway as the doorway seals off and becomes one with the wall. Alright, we're safe and recovering between tests. (Halls had a magic healing aura designed to keep you alive between fights) Now we come upon the next challenge, a plaque in front of three gargantuan apparations. It says 'Choose and Perish'. Remembering the absolute shitfest it was last time, I go straight to the door and attempt to open it. All three become corporeal as the DM laughs at our misfortune. WE WERE ONLY SUPPOSED TO FIGHT ONE.  Aaaand I'll leave it there. How will our heroes survive against an Enraged Dire Bear, Heavily modified Yuan-Ti Abomination, and a White Dragon?! *dun dun duuuunn*\n\n",

        "text": "For those somewhat familiar with my story of ƒÇrajƒÉ, this will be a change of pace. I created Penelope Reid to be a comic relief kind of character. ƒÇrajƒÉ plays such a serious roll that even I was getting annoyed playing her. \n\nThe idea of Penelope was to make an over eager fighter who wasn‚Äôt the brightest, yet competent enough to not be too much of a problem. I then had a great idea to make her a succubus that didn‚Äôt realize who she was. This was a big, break the mold, kind of character. Of course working with my DM, this is how we worked her back story so she could be this super strong, tough, and ditzy kind of character:\n\nA Paladin couple were out fighting evil. They had just killed a succubus when they came across a baby succubus (Penelope). Part guilt for having killed the creature‚Äôs mother and part longing for their own children they hadn‚Äôt been able to have, they adopt Penelope. There was also the excitement of discovering whether succubi were naturally evil or if they became evil to the the influences of their environment. \n\nPenelope was taught to be good and encouraged to develop her ability to disguise. Penelope grew up identifying as an Elf. She was told that the town wouldn‚Äôt understand her true identity and therefore better to stay disguised than to endure ridicule. It wasn‚Äôt a perfect disguise, for her legs remained goat like, but nothing a skirt couldn‚Äôt hide. Lucky her, Penelope grew up in an oblivious town and it wasn‚Äôt until years later when she was found out.\n\nHer parents kept her busy with farm work to ‚Äòbuild character.‚Äô While certain characteristics didn‚Äôt develop, due to not being around other succubi, other traits over compensated. Penelope grew and grew and grew. She finally stopped growing at 8‚Äô 5‚Äù (that was the decision of the DM. I wanted her to be medium sized). The town was impressed and her parents passed it off as her being blessed by Heironious. \n\nWith her large size, she was also unusually strong for a succubus. In fact she basically was the opposite of a succubus in stats. Low charisma, wisdom, and intelligence with average constitution, dexterity and ridiculous strength. Yet that aided to her not being suspected by the towns folk.\n\nPenelope‚Äôs a flirt and that‚Äôs about all her charisma can do for her; get guys to do the things she doesn‚Äôt want to do.  She also thirsted for adventure. She loved hearing the stories from the adventurer‚Äôs in the taverns whenever she could sneak away from work long enough. So when the opportunity presented itself, Penelope was eager to go on her own adventure. Except the adventure was involuntarily thrown upon her.\n\nA merchant had arrived in town one day and Penelope noticed a very large, jagged, scythe in the wagon. It stood out to her because it was huge! Taller than her! She inquired about it and the merchant mentioned it was something he picked up from a tribe of Giants and that it was a very strong weapon. Penelope was mighty impressed.\n\nSeeing how interested Penelope was, the merchant thought he‚Äôd have a little fun and trick her. See, it was a cursed scythe. My DM and I called it the Vorpal Lode Scythe of Darkness. It had a lode stone as a counterweight to which whoever touched the scythe would always have to carry the weapon. It was also a very heavy scythe. 133 pounds! \n\nOther fun quirks about the weapon is that if a 20 is rolled, the creature dies, no questions asked. Any other roll, I need to roll a percentile die to see if the scythe actually hits. There‚Äôs a 30% miss chance and when that happens, the scythe just ghosts through the object or being with no harm being done.\n\nAnyways, so the merchant wanted to trick Penelope and get a laugh. Not being familiar with her, he thought she wasn‚Äôt strong enough to carry the scythe. So he said she could have the scythe if she could pick it up. He anticipated her to chicken out or give it a try and fail. If she tried and failed, he had an anti magic stone to free her from her predicament. How surprised he was when Penelope accepted the deal and lifted the weapon with one hand.\n\nThe merchant now felt like he had been tricked. While Penelope enjoyed her victory (not yet realizing the effect of the lode stone), the merchant pulled out a Window of True Seeing to see who Penelope truly was. Shocked to find a giant succubus in his presence, the merchant fetched some Paladins and instructed them to see Penelope through his magic window.\n\nThe town at first was more on the side of Penelope, assuming the merchant was fooling them. Still, to make sure, they placed an anti magic field around Penelope. Pandemonium erupted as the town saw Penelope‚Äôs true form. Of course this broke the succubus‚Äôs heart for the town, until then, loved her for her positive, carefree, and friendly self.\n\nImmediately Penelope‚Äôs parents were put on trial to which they confessed that they knew what Penelope was all along and explained the circumstances. Still the parents were stripped of their ranks and told to live in poverty and service all their days. Maybe if they proved diligent in their new life, they‚Äôll earn their ranks back.\n\nAs to Penelope, it was clear she wasn‚Äôt evil, but no one wanted her in town. So she was exiled, never to return unless she wanted to die. With a heavy heart, Penelope waved good bye to the town, lugging the scythe behind her. As she walked up and over a hill, a thought came to mind. Finally, she was going to go on her own adventures and be the one regaling her tales to fellow adventures wherever she went. \n\nAnd so with more vigor, Penelope left her hometown, Paris, never looking back.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED\n\n[P.S. Here's some art work of Penelope and very rough draft editions of her continued tale. I'll be rewriting those parts (and posting them in the forum) so they'll flow better and spare you the crudeness of my writing a year ago.](http://adventuresofthealmostheroes.blogspot.com/p/penelope.html)",

        "text": "It was an Invasion game on Boneyard... \n\nFor those who don't know, Invasion is a gametype where one team holds off the other team over three stages. In the first two, the defending team must stop the attacking team from advancing,  if they fail once, they must do so again. If they fail again, they must try and stop the other team from taking their power core. If the attacking team steals the core, the defending team lose. Think of a three stage Capture The Flag\n\nAnyway, back to me. I was a SPARTAN (Defending team) and the other team were Elites (Attacking Team). The SPARTANS start off on an overlook to the canyon where the Elites come from, but everyone starts off with Assault rifles (Terrible except at close range) and a pistol (Good at any range). There are two DMR‚Äôs to pick up, which act as stand-in Sniper Rifles without the power. So, early on people start quitting. No problem, one or two is not too big a loss. However, more people start quitting and soon, only myself and two others remain. The Elites quickly take the overlook, we spawn at a platform above the overlook. We are slaughtered as soon as we spawned in. Eventually, the two other players quit, leaving myself the only one to hold of a dozen Elites. \n\nWell Damn.\n\nNow, the way the attacking team advances in Invasion is by standing in a small square area with no-one else from the other team in the area. I don't know why, maybe wanting to try and get the highest kill ratio override the sense in their minds that they could stand in the square and win. But they didn‚Äôt. They seemed more focused on trying to kill me. I see they are distracted, and run out time and time again after I am killed to make sure they don't remember, and keep trying to kill me. Eventually, one of the Elites manages to jump onto my platform. I run at him with my Assault Rifle and kill him, the only one I got since everyone else quit.\n\nSoon, the Announcer says that only 30 seconds remain for the attacking team to complete their objective. This clearly reminded them, and one Elite proceed to complete their objective, the others still trying to kill me. What I did next should have started with me turning on my mic and screaming at the top of my lungs ‚ÄúLEEROY JENKINS!!!‚Äù. I die again, so that I have full ammunition and sprint off the platform. I land directly in the center of the area. I kill the Elite in the area. I don‚Äôt know how, but for thirty seconds I managed to hold off a dozen elites with only my Assault Rifle and a few grenades, with little to no cover.\n\nWith only five seconds left on the clock, I am killed by being Assassinated. But by then it is too late. I had won, their desire to kill me making them forget their objective and scoring them victory. I will never forget that day, or that battle. \n\n*Ever.*",

        "text": "Greetings,    \n    I just recently found this sub, and grateful to have a place to share game stories, so I thought I would share one of my characters' funniest moments.  My group and I have been playing together for several years now.  One of our games is a superhero world we've been developing for a while now, with about three binders full of old PCs, and NPCs.  This takes place in our first round, set in modern time, and the public rise of the superheros.  The overall arch was that Loki (Not Marvel's Loki, but I doubt there can really be a copyright on ancient gods) is trying to bring the world into chaos by unlocking Hades from his prison.  I actually forget what this specific battle was over, but I do remember it involved Ares's army attacking a city, and it's up to the team to protect it.    \n    \nThe Team:   \nProfessor Val Tek: a techno genius with the powers to hijack and control anything electronic with his mind.    \nPrometheus: The exhiled Titan who's formed and mentoring the group to make sure humanity keeps and inherits the earth.    \nMentor: A stranded elf-like psionic alien with a promiscuity that is only rivaled by Cpt Jack Harkness    \nSgt. Major: (Me) An Iraq vet who was given the Super Soldier juice after being gunned down his first day home by a ganster's crew in retalliation for getting him kicked out.   \n     \nThe Incident:    \nGearing up on Prof. Tek's aircraft we get reports that the city is under seige by Ares's army, and we're about 15 minutes from the drop zone.  Val blinks putting the ship on autopilot while he straps on his parachute, Prometheus (who can fly) is making snarky comments about why Val would use such low tech means to get to the ground (he flies using a technological ring), and Mentor just hit on Sgt Major as I'm strapping on my [Squirrel Suit.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n_9ltHXd6A8/UUCK1o6W0AI/AAAAAAAAqwo/R7lUvtvcZUE/s1600/wingsuit.jpg)  Once over the drop zone Sgt Major just jumps, Val blinks and goes \"...did...did he put on a 'chute?\"  Prometheus replies, \"No...No he didn't...Œ∑ŒªŒØŒ∏ŒπŒøœÇ.\"  (Pause for an explination,  Sgt Major can run fast...like really fast, not mach speeds by any means, but at the time, he clocked in over 500mph, my/his thought process was 'I'm faster than I'd be going on the way down, all I need to do is get a good horizontal trajectory, close the wings, and hit the ground running. It might hurt the knees, but I've had worse')  Well, Sgt Major aims himself circling around the city, finds a good long stretch of road to aim for, lines himself up, closes his arms to drop the wings and [dice hit the table.......botch]  trips over a road divider and goes tumbling down the street, hitting street signs, cars, shredding the brand new armor Prof. Tek just made for him.  Shamlessly he gets up, throws whatever was left of the armor off, and begins the fight.  The Team easily stomps the soldiers, winning the day, but that was the day a superhero ended up on Youtube with the keyword \"fail.\"",

        "text": "This story takes place in our Christmas special our DM set up that happened so far after Christmas it could hardly be called a Christmas special, but whatever, to the story!\n\n   So our group of 4 adventurers (psion, barbarian, cleric, and me as an avenger) find ourselves randomly waking up in a small town, not really knowing what got us there or where we were, so we get up and look around town. After enough investigation we find that many of the town's children are being stolen and the town's Christmas spirit is all gone. After even more searching we track this to a well in the center of the town. At this point I am unconscious, honestly I don't remember how this happened which sucks, but I am, and the party drag me to the well with them.\n\n   Our Cleric, Lily goes down first, finding that the well does indeed lead somewhere, so she calls the rest of us down. Our barbarian, Bjorkus goes down, leaving the psion, Fred and I still up at the top. At this point I wake up, and ask Fred what we are doing and why are we at this well. Fred says, and I quote, \"there's Christmas in this well.\"\n\n   I immediately yell \"CHRISTMAS!!!!!!\" and jump down the well, failing any attempt at an acrobatics roll, or anything else that could help my landing, and so I immediately break one of my legs and almost go unconscious. Fred also starts making his way down the well.\n\n   Soon after I land we are attacked by a monster, and I can't do much so I decide to pray to my god Wikipedia (long story short about my god's name: it was a joke that became canon because why not?) to mend my broken leg, as I have a high religion score. I roll a flipping 1. Wikipedia responds to my prayer by saying \"did you know, having a 2 broken legs is worse than having 1 broken legs?\" and breaks my other, previously unbroken leg, and does enough damage that I go unconscious.\n\n   After some healing I become conscious again, and we awkwardly make our way through the dungeon. Close to the end of the dungeon we stumble into a trap room; the doors shut and the room begins to fill with water, and after much trying to escape, we resort to using the troy.\n\n   the troy is an extremely overpowered  shotgun that does something like 5 to 6 d6 damage a close range, and is extremely destructive, and so we believe it can break down the door. I grab the troy and walk up to the door, I aim and roll for attack. I roll a 13, troy's \"lucky\" number. When a 13 is rolled on the troy is immediately blows up, killing the user, but still doing damage to the things around it. So anyways, I blow up with the troy, but do manage to destroy the door, allowing the others to grab my corpse and move on.\n\nAfter maybe another room, we end up in a room with Santa Claus messing with something on his table, he turns around and informs us that he \"needs our help.\" We then convince Santa Claus that he should revive me, as I sacrificed my life for Christmas, and so he does, and we continue on our Christmas quest.\n\nTLDR? Santa is a pretty cool guy. ",

        "text": "In an Iron Kingdoms campaign I have been running, my players are members of a Mercenary Guild they lovingly named The Fightin' Seagals (after Stephen Seagal of course) but have acquired many names over time, my favourite being The Wyrmtang Clan after a terrifying battle with a tatzylwyrm (a tale for another time). The story I want to tell you is based on an attempt to find information about a man who hired and betrayed them. They found one of his sergeants, and upon interrogating him were told his boss would meet him in a certain graveyard.\n\nWhen the party arrives at this graveyard and stake out the place to set up an ambush for their betrayer, they are instead greeted by a group of men that turn out to be graverobbers. After brutally murdering 4 of them and one escaping, they wait out the night fruitlessly, but stake out another graveyard the next night, assuming their betrayer is the head of the graverobbing ring. This time, their stakeout efforts yield only two men robbing a grave, and their gobber (IK goblin) investigator/pistoleer sneaks up on them and shoots the one outside the grave, leaving the guy hoisting the coffin pinned inside. He then tells this man \"room for one more in there?\" At this point, the remaining graverobber is scared out of his wits and they interrogate him. He is a lowlife that is paid per corpse he brings to this mysterious group, so my party takes this guy as their cover to go meet them. When asked who they are when they arrive, they quickly retort with \"A bunch of graverobbers were murdered last night, can't be too careful, so he hired extra muscle to protect him.\" I am smiling ear to ear at them using their own killings as a cover story, but even better is that at this point they have hidden their Trollkin fighter, Trolgar inside the coffin they are delivering.\n\nUpon delivering the coffin, the party then steals a fishing boat (promptly christening it the SS Trolgar Sucks) to follow the graverobber barge up the coast to a secret cave where they operate out of. Upon entering the cave and surveying the scene, Trolgar erupts from the coffin pile to attack the dockhands as the party engages their ambush. After the dust settles, Trolgar asks about their boat's name, to which the party alchemist replies \"YOU CAN READ?!\"",

        "text": "Last night I ran the 5e starter set for my brother and a friend. This was the first dnd experience for both myself and my brother, while our friend had played a ton of 3rd edition. I've been wanting to get into tabletop rpgs for a while after enjoying some of the storytime threads both here and at /tg. As a first dm experience I found it pretty harrowing/overwhelming keeping up with the rules and narrating what was happening. Overall I think it went pretty well, but I need to work on describing the world around the players as well as seeding in adventure hooks to give them stuff to ponder.\n\nI wanted to write an after-action report to reflect upon where I think I messed up for future benefit/your present amusement. Sorry it's a bit long, but hopefully it's entertaining after a fashion.\n\nIf you pick something else up in here that I don't, let me know as I'm sure I did a whole bunch of junk wrong.\n\nFor those of you who haven't played it yet, there may be slightish spoilers for the 'Lost Mines of Phandelver' but only the first chapter.\n\nSo our party (I'll drop the character names as they were named after the players because reasons):\n\nMy brother was playing the Human Archer/Fighter character.\n\nOur friend was playing the Halfling Rogue.\n\nAnd because I'm an idiot I decided to run the Dwarf Cleric as backup for them. This was probably my first mistake. Refereeing the game as well as trying to actually play it was a bit much for my first game. However as you'll see, the cleric ended up being relatively helpful.\n\nThe adventure starts with the characters told they are escorting a caravan of goods from Neverwinter to the town of Phandahlin on behalf of a dwarf explorer called Gundren Rockseeker, and upon delivery they will each receive 10 gold pieces for their effort. \n\nAfter a bit of discussion, Archer/Fighter was walking guard in front of the wagon, with Cleric at the rearguard with Rogue driving the wagon.\n\nThey come across a couple of dead horses in the road with a couple of arrows in them, but the saddle bags are totally looted.\n\nEveryone failed the listed perception check so Archer/Fighter immediately took two goblin arrows to the face and hit the deck with only a couple of hit points. I couldn't find any rules regarding combat saves so we assumed that as soon as enemies beat your AC they could just roll for damage.\n\nRogue and Cleric both tried a perception check for the goblins, but failed. (I was still testing him against the DC listed in adventure, but perhaps I should have rolled each goblin's stealth again as they already announced their presence, but nm).\n\nArcher dude used his second wind as a bonus action to top his health back off, runs back towards the wagon, climbs in the back and passes the perception check. He sees the four goblins in the bushes just in time to see two goblin arrows hit the Rogue who falls out of the seat leaving him with 0 hitpoints. \n\nAnother problem I recognised after the fact was that maybe not all of the goblins would be attacking the same thing. As it happened they were the Goblin equivalent of an organised tactical response team mowing one party member down after another.\n\nWith all party members hidden in cover either in the wagon, or behind it, I assume the melee goblins would decide to run in. I can't remember what the book said the distance to the treeline was, but I just said about 50 feet so that the goblins wouldn't make it to the wagon in one turn and just bitch slap everyone.\n\nArcher manages to pick one of them off and Cleric uses his first spell slot to cast cure wounds on the rogue. \n\nThe last melee goblin rounds the wagon and drops the Rogue unconscious again, back to 0hp, but then gets absolutely cleaved in two by the Archer dude's greatsword. (he rolled out of the wagon. I didn't make him do an acrobatics or dex check or whatever, just take a movement). Cleric then uses his last spell slot to cast Cure Wounds again on the rogue.\n\nMeanwhile both rogue and cleric bodge another perception check to see if they can see the gobbos in the bushes.\n\nThen hiding behind the wagon's wheel (I gave him 3 quarters cover for doing so), Archer dude headshotted one of the gobbo archers. The last goblin tried a hide action (I figured he'd be keen to run given all his buddies just got murdered by one guy and the goblins can hide or disengage as a bonus action) but both the archer and the cleric could peg him on passive perception alone. (Maybe should have gotten everyone to roll perception?)\n\nAs the cleric saw him try and hide, he cast sacred flame and immolated him in one blast of righteous fire.\n\nAfter the combat was done, everyone was on full health (due to awesome cure wounds rolls), negating the need for a short rest so everyone got to work having a look about. Archer dude succeeds the survival roll and spots the trail to the hideout. He then also decides to loot the goblin bodies.\n\nThere was nothing in the book for this, but I could have improvised a) a couple copper pieces or whatever, b) a note or something hinting at the story hook that the adventurers are supposed to get out of the hideout (namely there's a castle that's affiliated or whatevs).\n\nRogue decides to sneak down the trail while Archer grabs the arrows out of the dead horses and pats down the oxen, while Cleric waits at the entrance to the trail at the other players' discretion.\n\nOn the trail, the Rogue is paranoid of another goblin ambush, so every single turnhe's choosing to roll for perception, and constantly failing every single one, while also moving one foot at a time. He's rolled a 25 or something on his stealth (with modifiers) so he's basically invisible, but because he keeps rolling 4s for perception he's basically just staring at his feet avoiding twigs that he might snap.\n\nThis bangarang stealth check only makes him more paranoid that there are more goblins in the woods that he can't see, because they are only failing to attack him because they in turn see nothing.\n\nIn the book the trail is supposed to be about 5 miles long, but as the Rogue was taking so long and the party was otherwise split, I ended up making it much shorter. It wasn't long before Rogue wanders into the rope snare, which naturally he failed to see. He passed his Dex save tho, and rerolls a gangbusters 23 for stealth, basically catapaulting himself out of the trap and then immediately disappearing.\n\nBack at the wagon Archer's having a fag or something, while Cleric (I) was getting bored, so I try to do a mime performance. I roll with plus 0 I think it was for performance, getting only a 7, so we all agreed that the Cleric made a shitty mime. After being called a troll by the Archer, he then decided to wander down the trail in search of Rogue.\n\nFeeling lonely/metagamey, the Archer followed him.\n\nNeither Cleric nor Archer can see Rogue who is still shuffling millimetres away from the rope trap staring at the floor.\n\nTo test the waters to see if he can flush any ambush, the rogue picks up a tiny rock and throws it into some bushes. There is no resultant ambush, but assuming that it was the rogue, the cleric starts wandering off-trail in search for the noise, stupidly calling out for him.\n\nArcher keeps to the trail and walks straight past the rogue towards the trail's final trap, a slightly disguised hole. Amazingly he spots the pit, covered with brittle twigs and leaves. In order to spring the trap so his comrades can see it, he tries to pick up a boulder to drop in it. I give him a str dc 10 check to pick it up (probably should have been a straight up athletics check) and fails.\n\nTo avoid the hole, the Rogue metagames that he sneaks up to Archer, noticing he has failed to pick up what looks like an otherwise unremarkable small-to-medium sized rock, taps him on the shoulder and asks 'whats up?', and Archer dude points out the trap. \n\nI didn't ask him to make his own perception check, because I was tired of seeing him fail it.\n\nUnprepared to roleplay a cleric getting lost off-trail, I reason that the Cleric finally sees the other two chatting and comes over to see what's happening.\n\nComically neither the Rogue nor the Cleric can pick up this rock either. All agreeing that it must be an insanely heavy rock, most of which is most definitely underground, Rogue decides to simply burn the leaves off the trap, revealing a simple non-threatening pit.\n\nWith the two traps on the trail over with about 20 feet from the wagons as opposed to 5 miles away, the group clears a turning to find the entrance to Cragmaw hideout.\n\nDespite their immense paranoia all of the way to the goblin hideout, the players decide it must be totally safe, light a lantern and wander straight in to find two goblins having a chat. But then again, they are promptly eviscerated in about two seconds of combat.\n\nThe cave entrance leads to a tunnel turning to the right with a stream on the left hand side. Just inside the entrance however is a set of stone steps leading up to a room. \n\nParanoia returned, Rogue sneaks up the steps to see two wolves chained to the floor. Deciding his animal handling is too low and his rations too useful, he sneaks back out. Due to my intense OCD spergy need to complete the dungeon areas in numbered order, I insist that the cleric is happy to use his rations to which they both call me a troll and move on down the tunnel.\n\nSlightly further down is a bridge about 20 feet in the air above the chasm with a lazy gobbo on it sitting guard. While the book does have rules for perception here (do the players see the goblin? Does the goblin see them as they have a lantern?) I forgot to double check them as I was starting to feel a bit overwhelmed with the amount of stuff going on.\n\nI let the Archer dude take a shot at advantage as presumably he's sneak attacking this goblin, and headshots him off the bridge into the stream.\n\nThe crew walk to the end of the tunnel finding a series of steps running up into a chasm with the sounds of waterfall and goblins arguing. Archer's killer perception notices three goblins, two of which are arguing over a leg of meat (I was trying to improvise) and a third grunting lazily. Rogue sneaks in and confirms this, then returns. They plan for archer and cleric to charge in while rogue sneaks behind one and sneak attacks him.\n\nThe two arguing are cleaved in two and explode in righteous fire respectively right in front of lazy grunty goblin who suddenly finds a sword at his throat. The crew try to interrogate him with good rolls for intimidation (thought wasn't sure what to compare them against, so just rolled a goblin strength check against it to see how scary he thought the guys were). Here I last minute try to seed various story elements, ie that they have been robbing dudes on the road a while, they have a boss called Klarg and he's been getting notes of some sort.\n\nThey then rough him up a bit, but accidentally kill him, although do learn that Klarg is in the adjacent room.\n\nDespite their SWAT-like take down of the goblins in this room, they decide to just run into Klarg's room and take him down that way.\n\nI didn't really explain very well to the players the room. I wasn't as descriptive as I should have been, even though there is a boxed text description for it, I could have added to it somewhat as it seemed like it was just Klarg, a couple goblins and a wolf chillin' around a fire sitting on sacks of junk.\n\nI gave the players a surprise advantage and a free round of combat, which they squander by trying to persuade Klarg to give them everything against a DC I set at 20, while the cleric sacred flames a terrible 1 hp off the wolf. \n\nRogue uses one of his feats to roll under Klarg (as Klarg is a bugbear which is a medium humanoid and I thought it made sense for a halfling to find that 'a size larger than him' as per the rules) and then passes another hide check so he can backstab the hell out of Klarg.\n\nLong story short, Cleric crits a sacred flame cast on the wolf, killing it and starts fending off goblins while Archer and Rogue get Klarg down to 1 hp. I didn't tell them this was the case, I just explained that he was 'exhausted and down on one knee, but still dangerous', and to prove it I had Klarg beat the Rogue down to 0hp.\n\nIt was at this point I regretted using both of the Cleric's spell slots earlier in the adventure.\n\nBizarrely Archer disengages from Klarg to help Cleric with the goblins, while Klarg goes to town on Rogue's body, dealing more than Rogue's maximum hp with him still unconscious, ploughing his head wide open.\n\nThe other two finished off Klarg and the goblins and we called it a night, as believe it or not, having one player get straight up murdered kind of soured the atmosphere a bit.\n\nAs a first time DM I found it all a bit overwhelming keeping track of all the rules and how they intersect, as well as remembering to put in the story hooks properly, although was kind of hoping that the other chapters in the adventure would point the characters in the right direction without me getting too railroady about it. I was also terrible at handing out XP as I think you are supposed to give out xp for monsters killed in addition to the bonus story milestone xp handed out in the book.\n",

        "text": "Alright, so every now and then between sessions my group will run what's called an Arena match in DnD. Random maps, random players, 1v1. Anything can happen.\nAaaaaaaand in the right corner of some dark-ass cave we have....Aesir! (later known as Pyrogue)\nAaaaaand in the left corner, we've got.... Generic Ranger! (GR)\n\nSo, the arena is a cave which collapses as soon as we walk in. Big-ass rock in the middle, we can't see a thing. I try and be all sneaky-beaky and sneak alongside the wall of the cave with my lit torch in hand while GR dicks around a bit in his neck of the woods. I see the glow of his torch, and huck mine over the rock to confuse him. While he has his back turned, I throw a dagger at him. I rolled for a combined total of 11. Fuck. So what does the bastard do? Turns around and pulls a nat 20. Instagibbed.\n\n So here's where the real story gets kickin'. The next map we were both on a table with beer mugs, food, and other random nonsense scattered across. We're also one inch tall. So I tumble onto the stool while GR dicks around with the beer mug, balancing all around it for no real purpose. Meanwhile, I grapple down to the bottom of the table and set the leg on fire. Fuck you, GR. GR sees the smoke rising and looks over the table to see what's up. He passes the spot check and he throws acid at me. \n\nLuckily he got a combined total of 3 and missed me entirely. I scurry underneath the table throwing an improvised trap behind me as I do so, but not before setting that stool on fire. You ain't using my escape route, bud. He runs to the other edge of the table and gets on another stool. What do I do? Fire, baby. This time he remembered his waterskin and tries to suppress the fire. It partially worked, and while not dousing the fire completely, he wets the wood around it enough to be able to climb down with his daggers. At this point enough time has passed so the first stool collapses in a beautiful blaze of glory. Unfortunately, a bunch of spiders were under the table and heading straight for me. \n\nBut there's one thing little GR forgot, and that was the fact I was still under the table. I sprint out of cover, and take aim with my throwing dagger. Since he's climbing, no dex bonus. Awwwhh yeaaah, sneak attack. I got him down to 2 hp in one blow, but that's not the satisfying part. After I threw the knife the table collapsed and splattered him against the stool he was clinging to for dear life! \n\nAnd to add insult to injury I narrowly escaped the burning wreckage.  \n\n",

Grabbing a few fire extinguishers,which I use to rocket myself forward, I go through the gateway to clown planet, where I meet, the clown king, planning his invasion. I throw him a bottle of vodka, which he thanks me for, and head back through the gate back to the station. The stations security forces were preparing the defense, and I head back to the bar to pick up my shotgun, then head back to arrivals to defend the gateway with my sec brethren. unfortunately for me, I never get to participate in the battle do to a confused head of security spraying me in the face with acid the chemist given to him, even after the chemist warned him, so while I spent the majority of the rest of the round in surgery, the clowns attacked. The stations security forces were attacked by two honk mechs, followed by a squad of clown soldiers, and the clown king. The station filled with honks as security fired laser after laser into the mechs, bringing one down, then another. Eventually the soldiers are killed or driven off, and the clown king lies dead, his bananium crown lying on his head.\nThe round was extended",

        "author": "writermonk",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2exzur/backtalk/",
        "text": "So, some years back I was running a slightly modified Ravenloft using AD&amp;D. The Domain in question was self-created. We played almost every evening after classes got out. The Domain was a sort of steam-punk pre-Victorian London kind of vibe, mingled with the usual fantasy elements. \n\nThe PCs, despite the city and Domain being predominately Human, were a native-born Dwarf Fighter-Thief, a Dwarf Fighter (later on he'd take some levels in Cleric), an Elf bard (who'd later take some levels in some Arcane prestige class), and a male Drow fighter-thief (totally going the sneaky assassin route). \n\nEach of them was around level 4 or 5 by the time this tale takes place. Each of them had a unique magical item (I loved creating those things to give some flavor to things). The import thing for this story is that the local Dwarven character, P, had a magical dagger called \"Backtalk\".      \nEssentially, Backtalk didn't do any additional damage, but when activated it would ***always*** hit a target, no matter the AC, no matter the resistances... *but* it would also go dead last in the round. Thus, 'backtalk.' \n\nThe adventure plot the PCs were on was fairly simple - someone was stealing orphans and urchins off the streets, particularly from the slum/ghetto areas where nearly all of the native demi-humans lived. The PCs, being not only good (well, mostly), but also demi-humans themselves were going to find out who and try to put a stop to it.      \nNow, through some early investigation, sneaking around, and so on, they did manage to discover that all of the disappearances coincided with the the arrival and subsequent departure of a given ship from the city's dock/port area. Big, huge, double-masted thing. Clearly, to the PCs, a pirate vessel of some sort. The crew didn't seem to be children, so obviously the ship was taking them somewhere else for some nefarious purpose. \n\nThe Players spent a while arguing about how to get aboard the ship. There were guards who were very alert (they'd tried to get aboard at least once already). One of the plans was to dress up P as some lowly urchin and then hope that the pirates would snatch him. P, in character, was horribly opposed to this idea. Three of the Players (and their characters) argued over this, round and round, for at least an hour. Finally, the Drow Assassin's Player, R, said that he'd had enough and while the others were arguing he was going to be all sneaky, get aboard, and at least watch the boat for a while until the others figured something out and joined him. *Cool,* I said. \n\nR and I broke out some dice. R went through some simple checks (watching the boat, figuring out a pattern in the guard patrols, sneaking up to the ship, sneaking aboard the ship). He was doing great on his rolls. As he got more and more excited with each clear and solid success, we attracted the attention of the other 3. They come over to where we were rolling, and that's when R... \n\n... rolls a 1. His last roll. The one for sneaking aboard the ship. He looks up at me with a look of mild shock on his face. The others ask what he's rolling for. I ask him to hand me his sheet. I look over it for a bit, and R starts urgently telling the others that he went to the boat alone to sneak on and that now he might be dead. I hand him his sheet back and ask him to just hang on for a bit. \n\nI ask the others if they've come up with a plan yet or not. P says, \"Screw it. I'm walking right up the gangplank and I'm going to ask to sign on as crew.\"\n\nThe others think he's crazy. R is silently cheering behind P, thinking that rescue is on the way. \n\nP heads to the boat. R is sitting in on the edge of his seat. The other two (M and D) are listening intently; they say that their PCs are waiting nearby on the dockside, lurking. \n\nP is let on the boat by some of the pirates, he makes some rolls to intimidate and bluff his way aboard, and within minutes he's standing in the middle of the deck with a bunch of pirates around him. Night has fallen, it's dark. The pair on the docks can see, but just barely. The ship's captain appears from below decks. He's obviously some monstrosity, riddled with the pox, and only stubbornly clinging to life ( *he was a zombie-lord, and while he looked hideous, he was quite strong* ). I make clear to P that Captain Zantosa was evil, hideous, and diseased. \n\nP goes along with his charade. Claims that he's tired of the oppression of the city and he wants to see new shores, he wants to sign up.      \nZantosa, staring down at this scraggly malnourished dwarf explains that there are only a few of his crew that go ashore, different ones for each city, trusted and honored members of the crew. That if P really wants to join, then he'll have to commit a crime heinous enough to get him kicked out of this city for good, or at least on the bad side of the city watch, and that after he's served aboard ship for long enough, they'll find a city that he can go ashore in later. \n\nP agrees to this, rolling more bluff checks. Over the course of this, he and the Captain have moved closer to one another, now only a few feet apart. \n\nThe Captain grins and says that he has just the crime. He signals to the other pirates and they produce a bound and gagged Drow (R's PC). The other Players are all \"oooooooh.\" The Captain says that P will have to kill and brutalize this strange dark-skinned creature. \n\nI pause. I re-iterate where everyone is standing. I emphasize that by merely reaching forward, P can easily stab the Captain in the gut. (P enjoyed using poisons and while the Captain was immune to poison by dint of being undead, P didn't know that yet.) \n\nP says that he pulls out his Backtalk dagger, cautiously coats it with poison. P's player doesn't even pick up a die, but says he's going to use the dagger's magic to make sure he hits. Everyone is leaning forward in anticipation.\n\nP says that he's going to stab the Drow. \n\nWe all look at him in shock. *No, no,* I say. *See, you're right here. R is beside the Captain. You can easily stab the Captain in the gut, and then... I don't know. Grab R and jump overboard.* \n\nP nods, as if understanding and repeats. \"I stab R.*\n\n*No, see. R is bound, he's not armed. He's tied up with a gag in his mouth. No spells even.*\n\nP nods. \"Yeah. I stab him.\"\n\nI look over at R, who is sitting, open-mouthed in shock, and I shrug. *Hey, R, can you roll your Poison save.*\n\n\n\n",

They go looking for a magic item store... I direct them to a merchant in the Market Ward that goes by the name Vincent Krauser, and he runs \"Te Majick Shoppe\". Now Vincent is a decent Wizard and can get a solid amount of power into a spell or item, but he's sort-of-dyslexic/terrible speller, which occasionally distorts his intent. He offers the party a great deal on a wand of Rope Trick... however sells them a wand of \"Rose Trick\" which works identically to the spell Rope Trick, but needs to be cast on a Rose to create a flowery haven. No one in the party decided to read magic the item, so they cannot tell the runes that power the thing are slightly off.  \n  \nThe party then decide to head back out to find the Khaasta that they were tracking before their stone warlock predicament... the warlock, Stanley, is still grumbling about being paralysed from the waist down... but flies everywhere anyway.  \n  \nSoon the party are trudging through the industrial polluted wasteland they were tracking the Khaasta through previously... though the signs of the Lizardfolk are gone. The party is cleverly scouting ahead with their fliers... when suddenly the sorcerer tumbles to the ground...well goes splat into the mud at least, screaming out a warning as an [Umberhulk](http://www.johnmsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AD&amp;D/Settings/SpellJammer/Others/WldWldWst/Neogi/Umber-Hulk.jpg) emerges from where he stood, it's burrowing having tripped Azrael, the combat is fast paced and the beast is obviously outmatched by the party... but Azrael is in a precarious position... the thing tears into him, almost killing him in a short burst of claw and mandible, the party wear it down and a flying, magic lanced, smite fuelled charge from the Drakkensteed riding paladin, Kask, destroys the creature. The party pick themselves up, heal Azrael and move on, keeping an ear to the ground now.  \n  \nThe world becomes a little less polluted by the time evening rolls around, as the party start to see hints of grass and fresh air, they stop by the town of Ironridge, just in time to see a brawl occurring at the front gates. Citizens are fighting, some bare fisted, some with knives, and a couple town guard are madly battering one another, others are just watching...unable to talk sense into the combatants.  \n  \nThe party uses detect magic to understand there is some sort of enchantment over the crowd, and dispels it, causing the fighting to stop and the combatants to wonder why they started fighting in the first place. The guard arrive and thank the party for dispersing the enchantment, upon further investigation it appears the Tavernkeeper and his Wife were the cause of the incident, but they fled back to their home when someone pulled a knife.  \n  \nThe party find them in their brewery, locked in their office, They shout desperately not to come in, that seeing their beauty makes people want to have them, and fight over them. The party scoffs at this a little...but when the Tavernkeeper mention they bought bottles of beauty for the Khaasta to mix into ale and were \"testing\" it... well the party believed the story. Azrael sent his Blink dog into the office through teleportation and subsequently telepathically told Azrael he wasn't coming out, that the tavernkeeper's wife was his and he would attack anyone else who tried to claim her.  \n  \nThey managed to dispel the enchantment on the Blink Dog by opening the door, casting dispel and dragging it out without looking at the tavernkeeper or his wife... they worked out through some divination and arcane study that the effects of the potion weren't permanent, and advised the town guard and clergy accordingly, the tavernkeeper's staff were to keep them fed and watered, but they were to remain out of sight for at least a week. The guard thanked them and provided them with information regarding the Khaasta, whom they believed to be traders as they often offloaded miscellaneous merchandise here, likely stolen goods.  \n  \n**Session 7**\n  \nThe party slept at Ironridge and in the morning headed out to the Realm of the Norns, as that is where the Khaasta were heading. They knew from one captured Khaasta that the encampment was among the forest, so they assumed that the forest was the Norn's forest. The Norns are powerful beings, three divine entities that are essentially the fates of the world, past present and future... there are lesser norns also, who are the fates of particularly important or heroic souls. This is essentially lifted from Norse Myth.  \n  \nThe Party head north and are approached after they travel through the glades of the outlands...approached by a Stone Tower, a large, 200ft tall, Stone Tower on four giant chicken legs. A Wizard did it. Tiac Rami No, the Wizard, greeted the party from a window of his moving tower, and asked the Party where the Khaasta were, he wanted more bottles. When they said they were tracking them he invited the party inside where his charmed spider monkeys and invisible servants offered them curried meats, flatbreads, a rainbow of roasted peppers and rice wine. They told him about the realm of the Norns and the castle sped toward it, this shortened the journey considerably.  \n  \nThey sat and ate, grew suspicious of Tiac Rami No, an old and smiling man in a robe and turban, and realised they were locked in the guest room, a lavish sort that seemed very arabian with cushions and pillows and gold rugs adorning the walls; They were not allowed to explore his castle... all doors locked (and the cleric didn't even try to pick them!) They grew nervous when they heard the wizard through the walls saying \"Soon, yes, soon my pretties, more precious bottles, yes\".  \nWhen he returned they asked him who he was talking to, but he told them to stop being silly, he lived alone... excepting the half dozen spider monkeys and he arranged the room to be made plushier and cushier...so the party could sleep.\nAs the Wizard slept they sent Stanley's companion, a Ghost named Dreyfus exploring... he did so and reported back that it seemed like a perfectly normal wizards tower... the wizard was the sole occupant (spider monkeys sleeping in the guest room with the party) and that there was a library and alchemists lab upstairs.  \n  \nThe party decided the wizard was suspicious, but mostly harmless as long as he wasn't offended.  \n  \nWhen the wizard awoke the next day they discussed the realm of the norns, discovering that the wizard hadn't really thought about what to do when they got there...and essentially intended to send his home stomping through the woods. In the middle of this conversation the wizard began to fade away and vanished...as did parts of the furniture...and the tower...  \n  \nSome of the party quickly react, Kask summons his steed and Fortinbras, the favoured soul of Bahamut mounts it, whilst Kask featherfalls to the ground. Stanley tries to carry Baha Abdur and Norril to the ground safely, but drops them for minimal damage. Azrael teleports to the ground, I give him a save chance and he basically lands with momentum, tumbles arse over elbow and is mostly fine...albeit wet and muddy in a river bank... he aimed for the water. Roku just stands there... drops like a stone (he basically is the Thing from fantastic four). Lands into the ground, rolls like a boulder and stands... having taking pretty minimal damage due to his hardy nature... Three spider monkeys land amidst the chaos, using a sheet as a parachute and a cushion as landing gear, they tumble around, get free of the sheet and bound into the forest, unimpeded by the thorns and brambles.  \n  \nThe party heal up their minimal damage and work out the Norns probably wanted to protect themselves from a half-sane wizard and his tower... they also notice a clue, an indent of bare earth, a circle of dried blood and a broken bottle... they didn't know what it meant but realised it meant the Khaasta came this way. After Kask and Fortinbras's Wyrmling checked for entrances, covering a few miles of the outside by flight they decided that it was all brambles and thorns... Baha wanted to hack through but was dissuaded by Fortinbras and Kask.  \n  \nThe party then began to enter the realm of the Norns, they wandered and the brambles seemed to part and allow them passage, offering up no resistance to the party... although when they started walking into thorns and brambles on purpose, testing the forest like idiots they got a few cuts and scrapes... so they went back to traversing it and it left them alone again. After six hours of wandering they noticed the trees were huge and high, and they were probably nearing the heart of the forest. The trees were well over 100ft high, and the trunks were at least ten foot wide. They came to a fallen Oak and noticed that Wagon tracks were ingrained in the trunk, as if someone had led a wagon up the great trunk like a path... they investigated and found a portal about 50ft along the fallen oak, which went up like a ramped path. (The Norns Realm is apparently Wheelchair friendly.)  \n  \nConsulting Dreyfus, the Ghost with amnesia who is the Warlock's \"Spirit Guide\" he told them it was a natural portal an didn't require a key... then he questioned everyone's intelligence and told them it was obvious...sighed and generally acted obnoxious, refusing to answer any more asinine questions.  \n  \nThe party walked the trunk and moved through the portal, coming out onto a wide trunk... no... branch...a Branch of an enormous tree, the branch twisted and turned as they walked it, it also widened out to over 500 yards across, Stanley, Azrael and Norril have a decent Knowledge of the planes and worked out they were on Yggdrasil, the World Ash, a Tree that starts in Ysgard and stretches out all over, it's trunk being part of the Astral plane... they warned people that if they fell off they'd be floating in the Astral helplessly... but the gravity of Yggdrasil went all around the branches... still it's worth being careful.  \n  \nAs they followed the branch they were stopped by four [Wood Woad](http://zorr.free.fr/monstres/Wood%20Woad.bmp) who seemed to just want to stop intruders... Fortinbras attempted to pass and they struck him, he stopped. Norril touched one and used comprehend languages because apparently no one in the party spoke Sylvan. The four spoke, one word each, slowly. Trespassers. Drop. Weapons. Now.  \n  \nAs the party did, a graceful Dryad came out of the bark like exiting a pool of water, graceful and elegant. Explained to the party that they were defensive as they were attacked recently, some of their people slain and two dryads kidnapped. The party vowed to rescue them as soon as they learned it was the Khaasta's doing. The Dryad charmed Roku and he confirmed that his allies spoke the truth. The party was invited inside Yggdrasil, pulled in through the bark by the beings. They spent the night with Sap Ale and Honey Mead, entertained by the wood folk and also asking questions whilst they had a chance to do so.  \n  \nThey were lead to a point at the edge of the territory they claimed by wood woad's the next day and shown in the distance two things.  \n  \nThe first was a city, nestled between the base of this branch and another. The second was a knot which acted as a portal to the Khaasta's home. The party elected to investigate the knot first and managed to enter the portal, emerging ontop of a large flat boulder, which was large enough to accommodate all of them. The land around was arid, dusty, rocky and sparse. The boulder began to move, sliding down the rock face until coming to a halt near a quarry/crater/pit, the sudden stop sent half the party into the dust, a similar scene to the tower fall yesterday and the party eyed the encampment.  \n  \nTheir intelligence led them to believe there was about 50 Khaasta, capable of fighting, some women and children and some slaves. The pit was 2000ft across and about 90ft deep, with five buildings. A great stone barracks, a large tower which was much more well made than the barracks, a couple wooden storage huts and stables, and a slave pens, housing about 50 slaves that look weary.  \n  \nThey saw Khaasta moving supplies around, shiny things went to the tower, practical stuff like food to the barracks and everything else was in storage. Women looked just as battle ready as men, in armour with weapons at their side and some even had their young strapped to them in armoured leather harnesses, wearing them about their front.  \n  \nWe ended it there, now the party get to discuss tactics for session 8.  \n  \n[Next Story](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2gkc3k/keeping_calm_and_killing_khaasta_dd_35e_e6/)",

        "text": "This is a pretty long one (or at least I think so), didn't plan it to be but it turned into one, so just be warned if you want to read it.\n\nSo to preface this story you must understand two entities in our campaign: the leviathan and the shy-guy.\n\n   The leviathan was a sword that I pulled out of a stone that could talk to me telepathically. It was quite obviously evil, but any time I tried to throw it out, it would magically reappear, also it could transform into any weapon. I don't actually know much about the leviathan as it turns out the more the wielder learns about the leviathan the more insane you go, so my partners learned about it, but not me. (turns out it was some kind of ancient evil god or something)\n\n   The shy-guy is the most terrifying monster I've ever seen a DM create. (EDIT: apparently the idea of the shy-guy was taken from here: http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-096 with very small changs) The shy-guy is an immortal being that is humanoid, but very tall and boney. Our DM can also draw well so he drew the shy-guy, and this creature looked scary as crap. The shy-guy can also run extremely fast and does d20s of damage (and we're only like level 3). This creature is determined to kill you if you ever see his face, one time, when trying to escape from a jail, one of our characters, we'll call her lily, saw a crying man in the corner, and eventually went up to him and tapped him on the shoulder. This was the shy-guy who turned around and saw lily and immediately began to attack, and so she ran, and we then eventually all saw the shy-guy's face and he was enraged at us all. Luckily the shy-guy hates sunlight, so we escaped to the outside. We had multiple encounters (and by encounters I mean us running away from the shy-guy) with the shy-guy and we were all kind of terrified of him.\n\n   So anyways to the story.\n\n   So our DM decides to do a Halloween special for our next encounter, so he sets up a Halloween themed dungeon we were given a quest to go see why everyone died in one town, which eventually lead us to a large mansion in the center of said town. We eventually split up (not willingly) and everyone becomes lost in the mansion.\n\n   So here's where things get interesting.\n\n   Apparently a illusion spell had come over all of us to see each other as monsters so when we did see each other we saw monsters, not ourselves. So eventually after fighting a couple of miscellaneous monsters, I see some sort of grotesque monster rush into a room, this is my friend, Bjorkus. I am actually able to see through the illusion and I realize this is Bjorkus, so I open the door, trying to explain said illusion to Bjorkus.\n\n   Bjorkus doesn't see me walk in and explain everything, he sees the shy-guy speaking some strange language. As soon as he sees this he attacks me, forcing me to subdue him, and knock him out, losing health points on the way.\n\n   It's important now to describe the room: it was a fairly small square room with barrels and chests with one door leading to a hallway, and another leading to a greenhouse type area.\n\n   Also Important is the fact that Lily at this point is off by herself, and has been infested by bugs that would hurt her from the inside.\n\n   Anyways, after I knock Bjorkus out, I try to heal him, hoping that knocking him out stopped the illusion. It didn't. immediately upon waking up Bjorkus sees the shy-guy (me) over him a, being a barbarian, gets up and attempts to ram me into the door leading to the green house. he rolls for attack... and rolls a 20... and confirms, so not only does he ram me into the door, he rams through the door, and on the way to the back of the greenhouse, a bunch of thorns on the way, and with a lowered health I've died while the thorns are hitting me. Bjorkus then gets to the back of the greenhouse where a giant venus fly-trap type plant grabs hold of my body and rips me in half, the illusion wears off for Bjorkus and he can see I'm Montana Smith (my character), so he retrieves the body and studies the plant. He realizes this plant's leaves, in a certain concoction can resurrect someone from the dead, so he carefully retrieves some leaves and brings me back to the square room.\n\n   Once there he sets me down, and instead of reviving me, he sets out in search of Lily, as he has a life debt to her, and therefore she's more important than I. It's okay though I don't mind.... mostly because i'm dead you know, but yeah, he leaves me.\n\n   Finding Lily shortly after leaving, and realizing the illusion they are able to fight off the monster Lily had been fighting, and decide, since Bjorkus now had the magic resurrection leaf, and Lily still had the bugs which seemed impossible to remove, they both decided the best option was to burn Lily to kill the insects, then resurrect her, and so Bjorkus killed Lily and then burned her body (not all the way, just enough to generate the heat to boil the bugs alive). And so Bjorkus had managed to kill both of us leaving only him.\n\n   Bjorkus was about to insert the leaf juice, when I opened walked through the door, or at least my body did. So while I was abandoned in the room, the leviathan had turned into a creature that was composed of a large eyeball with lots of tentacles coming out of it, and used said tentacles to take control of my body to attack the other members of the party.\n\n   And so Bjorkus was forced to subdue the leviathan, and resurrect us both which he did, although it took like 12 hours or something ridiculous because of how serious our characters injuries were, so the magic leaf juice took a while to heal us.",

        "text": "This is a continuation of a story I posted the other day about [Og and Aria](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2es0qu/pathfinder_the_moment_when_the_party_realizes/). It will make much more sense reading that. TL;DR Racist PC nearly gets one-hit killed by a secretly evil PC.\n\nSo Aria manages to survive her skull's encounter with the wine bottle due to a PC cleric taking pity on her and popping a couple of CLWs. She wakes up and her plater, we'll call her Taylor, announces at the table that she's going to exact her revenge on Og's PC, who we'll name Jared.\n\nI stop play and remind her that Jared was acting within character and was not attacking Aria because of any OoC reasons. Taylor, in one of our previous sessions, had taken some in game actions as personal attacks on her, so I made it clear to her and the party that any revenge or vendettas were to stay in game. Aria is well within her rights to exact revenge against Og, but Taylor has no right to hurt Jared. Nods all around, Taylor agrees, Jared smiles and is ready to see what she can throw at Og.\n\nWhile most of the party had been exploring the ground floor trying to find the drug lord, the thief had snuck off in order to pilfer. The thief, a newer player, noticed that a particular treasure chest looked odd, but couldn't quite place what. Dollar signs ring in her eyes for the few moments before the tentacles shot out and gnashing teeth met her. A mimic! She starts screaming bloody murder (in *and* out of game) and the non-nearly-dead party members run off to find her, leaving the monk and a cleric to handle Aria.\n\nAn epic battle takes place, nearly TPK, but everyone manages to stabilize. The drug lord they were tracking gets caught in a dialogue and is eventually knocked out. Most of the party was out cold (Og included) due to being low level and some not great rolls. Aria, after being healed, went to work on concocting a spiked \"peace\" offering for Og. She had easy access to some mushrooms (what with it being in a drug lord's den) and began to dose a bottle of wine with some crushed shrooms.\n\nShe met back with the party and forcefed the downed Og the wine. Now, due to a long and complicated series of decisions Og had been manacled and fettered to prevent further damage to the party and their quarry.  After a little while I started a counter on the temporary hitpoints Og would be gaining. I told Og that he was up, and felt fantastic. So fantastic, in fact, that he felt like he could take on the world. Literally.\n\nThe fetchling summoner was set to guard Og with a crossbow, and started panicking the moment Og started wrestling with his manacles. He became even more panic when, with a ferocious roar, Og broke through the manacles with brute force. The trigger went off with the fetchling screaming a mixture of \"OH FUCK\" and \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\" and Og went back under.\n\nUnfortunately, it was late in the night and we had to call it quits before the rest of the story could unfold. Next game I run (which just may be this weekend) hopefully I can have a nice solid ending for you.",

        "text": "So my stories so far have been focused on the ridiculous exploits of one of the groups I game with. For this story, however, I will take you to my other group in the pathfinder setting. I am the primary GM for this group, and I have been running the Carrion Crown adventure path. \n\nThe focus of this story is on one of the players (my brother, actually). He is playing a gunslinger. Now, the gunslinger is the single most OP class in pathfinder. He has a full base attack bonus progression (same as a fighter), but all guns resolve against touch ac (no armor). Damage ranges from 1d4-1d8 on one handed firearms, and from 1d8-2d12 on two handed. Those are for the \"early firearms\" category. Almost all of them have a x4 crit modifier. Unfortunately, I didn't read the part of the rules that warned that allowing guns/gunslingers would substantially change your game... So when he asked if he could play this (as his first character, actually), I agreed. \n\nSo bottom line, he almost never misses, and he does an assload of damage. Currently, he is dual wielding pepper box pistols (an early predecessor of the revolver), and using rapid shot a lot, giving him 4 attacks a round at 7th level. So he is usually the MVP in combat. With the exception of the party monk (whose AC while fighting defensively is in the low 30's, making him an extremely effective tank), most of the party rarely feels useful in combat. I have already made plans to severely restrict guns after this character dies. My brother actually offered to play something else when he learned how unhappy the party was, but they actually voted that he should keep it, just this will be the only gunslinger played in our games ungimped. \n\nAnyway, so I was looking through the adventure path, and realized that it was pretty low on equipment designed for our more specialized characters (the monk and the gunslinger), so I designed a mini plot point of my own, involving the cult they were inadvertently following sending dopplegangers of the party to take them out. I based these dopplegangers off the characters themselves, and equipped them with the loot I wanted to get the party. I had a contingency plan in place in case the party lost, since I was making this an extremely difficult fight. Then the party got smoked, and the players found a number of holes in my plan that I had missed.\n\nAfter a heated argument, and a more carefully planned retcon, I finally got the party their gear. Obviously, I had been leery about giving the gunslinger any magic weapons... He destroyed my encounters most of the time without them. But after an encounter in my other group with a bag of devouring (cursed bag of holding), I came up with a good (and hilarious) way to deal with it. I would give him magic weapons.... But I was gonna curse the unholy shit out of them!\n\nStill with me? Here's where it get's good. \n\nI give him two +2 pepper box pistols. One is called the ornery pistol. It had a strong aversion to talk of peace. By default, if you make a diplomacy check to improve someone's initial attitude, it will jump into the wielders hand (magically loading, if necessary), and tries to shoot the person. This would obviously be rather game breaking, so I modified it to \"whenever you try to avoid combat\".\n\nThe other pistol is a custom cursed item I created. On a critical hit, it changes the users race, rolling on the reincarnation table. It happens instantly, though it's frequently not noticed until after combat ends, since he's typically hanging back. Since the gunslinger dual-wields the pistols, I roll a d100 whenever he crits. 1-50 the crit came from this pistol, 51-100 it came from the other. \n\nOriginally, this gunslinger was a human. The first time he crit though (not long after getting the pistols, actually), he turned into an elf. For the most part, this was considered an improvement. Then we took a long hiatus from that game, as the backup gm ran a game. This past Saturday was our first session back to my game... During the session, he rolled two critical hits... Both on his race change gun. The first time (really early in the session, actually) he turned into a gnome. The second time, he turned into a half-Orc. \n\nHis other pistol came into play later on that session. They were faced with several werewolves, with the howls of many more quite audible. The werewolves gave them an chance to leave. As they were about to take it... The guns curse kicked in. \n\nMe: \"hey, what's your highest attack modifier\"\n\nGunslinger: looks quizzically/distrustingly \"why?\"\n\nMe: \"just give it to me\"\n\nGS: \"no, fuck you man, I'm not shooting him. My fingers are nowhere near the triggers\"\n\nMe: with shit-eating grin becoming unconcealable \"just give me the number\".\n\nHe gives me the number. I roll a crit (too bad it wasn't the other pistol). I have everyone roll will saves to avoid being startled. They all pass, fortunately. \n\nMe: \"you all jump a bit as you hear a shot ring out in the night, and you see the werewolf reel as a bullet hits it in the chest. Turning to the gunslinger, you see him standing there, gun smoking, but finger clearly nowhere near the trigger. A look at his face indicates he is just as confused as the rest of you.\"\n\nThe best part of all this... Nobody has picked up on the curses yet. You would think that a gun going off like that would be a tip-off... But no. You would think that he might want to investigate why he keeps changing race.... But no. He seems to have just resigned himself to his fate. I'm not surprised that he hasn't made the connection... It hasn't been obvious that the race changing is due to the critical hits, and the player is fairly new, so he's never encountered a cursed item before. Most of the party, though, is pretty veteran. Plus, I gave them all a pretty big hint. For some reason, after the werewolf incident, he decided to ask the next npc they talked if he knew what was happening, and why. \n\nMe (as npc): Well I'm sure I don't know... Have you been cursed recently?\n\nGS: Not that I know of. \n\nThat was it. No more was said. I have a number of things/ways that I am prepared to give them if they make even a half-hearted attempt to figure out why this is happening... But until such time, this is funny as hell for me, so I will just keep on changing his race 3:)",

        "text": "A bit of background before we begin. I used to run a somewhat casual D&amp;D 3.5e game on Sundays to help teach the system to new players. Since then about half of them have stuck with me and we've moved on to Pathfinder. One of my players, mokeymanq, will usually jot down summaries of each session, usually noting the most comedic parts while still preserving important plot details in his own, shall we say, terminology. Today I share with you some of the highlights of this campaign which may or may not continue at some later date. The basic story is that they're regular humans trapped in some sort of dream world and they've got magical powers and abilities (akin to the Pathfinder setting) and need to find a way out, kill the BBEG, blah blah blah. Let's get started!\n\n**The Characters:**\n**Jason** - Duelist Fighter (Press \"X\" to Jason); **Ryan** - Alchemist (Is probably an android, constantly wearing sunglasses); **Robert** - Monk (Uses CMB rolls to \"hug\" monsters to death);\n**Billy** - Oracle (Healbot + Smashbot, likes to cast Enlarge Person); **Kat &amp; Felix** - Ranger &amp; Tiger (Joined late, shoots acid arrows of death, pet tiger) **Wilirkers &amp; Sokal** - Two players that eventually had to leave the campaign.\n\n*Mordecai* - NPC Wizard (Supposed leader of the resistance, very incompetent); *Canas* - NPC Sorcerer (Mordecai's right-hand man, very competent); *Wynna* - NPC Rogue (Has a big crush on Jason, not good in combat) *Wulfa* - NPC Barbarian (Originally from Earth, likes to smash things)\n\n* After talking to the mysterious man, it is determined that we are the chosen ones that must take on this adventure... and by that Mordecai means he already talked to the mayor and volunteered us for the task.\n\n* We proceed to the mineshaft. Jason, being the fighter, leads the party. Light is immediately cast on him, turning his chest into an Iron Man-styled mobile lantern.\n\n* The party forges on, finding a swarm of ratfolk. They seem civil towards our party, and the party, in an impressive amount of restraint, performs the heretofore unprecedented feat of not immediately slaying anything in a 5-kilometer radius.\n\n* The ratfolk are revived and shuffle off in the direction of their group, shouting warnings against proceeding onward. The party immediately disregards these warnings.\n\n* The party brainstorms a suitable strategy for the upcoming assault, and decide on diplomacy. Ryan and Billy Kidd are sent as the \"bait\".\n\n* The GM hasn't come up with a name for the main quest hub. It is dubbed TOWN_NAME.\n\n* In the morning, Wulfa produces a suspicious chest from the room we were forbidden to enter, and we set off for the town. The session ends here, as the party tries to ignore the fact that the chest is named \"Mimic\".\n\n* NEXT TIME ON DRAGON BALL Z: Will the party be able to save TOWN_NAME from the impending threat? Will Billy Kidd roll higher than 8 for Knowledge(RPG)? What exactly is the force trapping the main characters in this dimension? All these and more might start to be answered, so be sure to tune in for the dramatic continuation of CAMPAIGN_NAME!\n\n* The party sets to doing what they do best: Killing everything in sight until it is dead, and then only stopping reluctantly.\n\n* During the melee, Robert joins the party. He is welcomed with open arms by virtue of the fact that not immediately killing the party proves him to be at least neutral toward us.\n\n* ???? reappears and casts a spell that disorients everyone and the campaign enters Cutscene Mode(TM). ???? makes an ominous speech and prepares to kill the party, but is stopped by ?????. ???? and ????? exchange a few cryptic words before ???? flees the battlefield. ????? tells the party that there is no time to explain what happened before stunning them with a flash of light.\n\n* The party tries to get information from Mordecai before going to bed. He tells them to wait until morning, so we put his hand in a bowl of water and make ghost noises. He fails the will save and wets himself in his sleep.\n\n* \"I must go now. My planet needs me.\" ~Sokal (NOTE: Sokal died on the way back to his home planet.)\n\n* INCOMING PLOT. Attempts to dodge and disbelieve the plot end in failure.\n\n* Exploring on, we find a room full of kobold bodies. This is surprising because to the best of our knowledge, we haven't stabbed anything in this wing of the dungeon.\n\n* \"I'm going to run away now, before I get killed by the Travelocity dwarf, a poorly drawn MS Paint demon, and a side character from The Wind Waker.\" ~Jason\n \n* Jason is killed by the Travelocity Dwarf, a poorly drawn MS Paint demon, and a side character from The Wind Waker.\n\n* Nobody seems to be able to hit the minotaur. Just as the characters begin to acknowledge this, Robert crits with both of his fists. Combat ends.\n\n* Jason is remarkably persistent. ???? goes super-sand, becoming the embodiment of the GM himself. RyuuKen savagely beats Jason, reducing him to 1HP as well as non-lethally unconscious.\n\n* The fighting is finished. Ryan returns from his hiding spot, and arranges the unconscious bodies of the rest of the party in a circle around him. One unspecified unit of time later, they come to.\n\n* Robert attempts to knock Ryan's shades off to try to prove that he is a robot. This fails, as beneath Ryan's sunglasses lies only more sunglasses.\n\n* Ryan makes plans to invent credit. Jason is hired as his enforcer. The two of us wonder exactly when the GM will notice that we're listed as Lawful.\n\n* Willirkers has two hands. This deserves mention. Yes.\n\n* Our newest party member faces his induction rites. He sneaks into Mordecai's room and sews the physicist to his bed sheets, as well as disables his hat.\n\n* We all eat breakfast. Mordecai shows up later, saying he had trouble getting out of bed. Upon mentioning how his (disabled) hat must have shrunk in the wash, Mordecai's hat begins threatening him. He throws it on the ground and storms off to his room as Billy ends his Ghost Noise spell.\n\n* The assembled mages take the only logical action when confronted with a vaguely magical being: \"Humans! They know too much! Kill them!\"\n\n* Billy ignores the whole \"ranged combat\" thing and climbs the cliff the Ranger is shooting from. This emboldens Robert, who passes Billy and gets to the top of the cliff in the time it takes Billy to move 5 ft.\n\n* Robert vaults behind the boss from Jason's shoulders, allowing two characters to melee the boss at once. He promptly crits his flurry of blows, knocking his adversary off the bridge into the water. He promptly drowns, ending combat.\n\n* Through offerings of meat, the dog's loyalty is earned. It promptly claims Billy as part of its territory. Territory must be guarded, and so the baby demon-dog commits itself to following the Murder Hobos on their adventures. Mascot get.\n\n* The party fights. Ryan was too busy screwing around in the maze, and cannot contribute to the fight because he is lost. The party's lethal potential is not in any way negatively affected.\n\n* The kobold strategy of \"group as closely together as possible\" turns out to be ill-advised when going up against a PC who throws explosives.\n\n* Leaving the castle, the party encounters a concealed pit trap. Ryan is the unlucky victim, but Robert's strength is more than enough to propel him out of the pit and into Billy's arms. The romantic moment is cut short by Ryan's being dumped unceremoniously on the ground.\n\n* The Guardsman initiates the fight, though, so murdering everyone in a half-kilometer radius is TOTALLY JUSTIFIED. MURDER HOBOS, TO YOUR BATTLE STATIONS!\n\n* The Murder Hobos attend to their battle stations, which is to say that everyone in a half-kilometer radius is forcefully fed their own intestines.\n\n* The party is faced with another hallway. To avoid any possible traps, Robert jumps down it. He manages a 30 ft jump from a standing position. The party applauds his acrobatic abilities, but it is for naught as the hallway is revealed to have no traps for at least the first 30 feet.\n\n* Billy is levitating. Ryan shoves him down the hall and manages the first ever canonical instance of riding another team member. This gets the pair past the obstacles in one magnificent burst of speed. Attempts to engage in mounted combat go terribly for everyone involved.\n\n* Robert attempts a hug. It fails. Morale plummets.\n\n* All the clones are dead, so we enter Story Combat. Robert sets a world record in punching by nat20ing the story roll AND the crit roll.\n\n* Leon joins the party of his own volition. I'm not sure what's wrong with him either. Plot is postponed by the discovery of the factory's self-destruct button. Robert calls dibs.\n\n* \"Well... I-I'm not as skilled as you... you all...\" ~Wynna (http://i.imgur.com/CXm9cYy.jpg)\n\n* We speculate on the bedding arrangements of the rest of the party. It is determined that Ryan goes into Billy's closet and powers down for the night.\n\n* We successfully convince Mordecai that Felix is a human trapped in Tiger form. Additionally, Billy is our interpreter.\n\n* The castle has two things that need doing: The kitchen have a rat infestation and the floors need to be swept. We decide to kill rats like a bunch of level 1s.\n\n* Robert meets with a few townspeople. One crotch-grab later, he is deemed uninfected and therefore a God. At this time, Jason immediately doubles over with a burning pain in his crotch.\n\n* Robert goes back into town for some information gathering. Half the town is rendered unconscious by the time he leaves, and a religion is beginning to form with him as the vengeful God figurehead.\n\n* Levi promptly channels his inner Andy Samberg and THROWS IT ON THE GROUND. This releases the vapors into the air, canceling out the airborne STD. Said alchemist urges the party not to tell the townsfolk he had cured them, a request the Murder Hobos quickly agree to.\n\n* Ryan proclaims himself to be the angel who appeared to the prophet Robert, the figurehead of the town's newest religion. The townsfolk believe him, and the rumor is substantiated by Robert.\n\n* A power struggle erupts as Robert realizes Ryan's status as an angel puts him above Robert in the holy hierarchy. He leaps the 20+ feet to Ryan's height and grabs onto him. The two are enlarged, and the alchemist is beat into near-unconsciousness. This is spun as a holy sanctification ritual, and the masses venerate the proceedings. Wynna and Jason try really hard not to associate themselves with the rest of the party.\n\n**EDIT** - Formatting, spelling mistakes, etc.",

We were still learning this at the time of this story, and so we got caught in a trap, because we didn't check the room enough before we stepped in, honestly I can't remember what this trap was, but after we got out of the trap we made all agreed we need to roll everything we possibly can in the rooms here-after, and so we continue. We open a door and see a cylindrical room, hearing that we were going to be rolling for everything we can our DM puts a rat in the middle of the room. The rat in the middle of the room is so conspicuous we immediately begin rolling on the rat, we roll perception, nothing special about the rat, we roll insight, it is indeed a rat, dungeneering, it appears to be a regular rat, religon, the rat isn't divine, it's a rat, nature, it is a common rat. seeing that the rat is harmless, we foolishly walk into the room, hit a trip wire and trigger the trap. We apparently were so focused on the rat that we forgot to check the room... for anything, and so the door shuts behind us and rats begin pouring in from all the walls, nearly killing us in the process from the massive amount of rats, and we never forgot to check rooms ever again.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2es0qu/pathfinder_the_moment_when_the_party_realizes/",
        "text": "Backstory: Over the summer I was running a homebrew once-a-week campaign that will hopefully continue into the future. Most of the players are weekly players of about a year-two years, and we have a couple of very new players. I really encourage roleplaying characters and will often take throwaway comments and actions and make them canonical. It's caused some friction, but I don't do it often. \n\nSo the party make-up changed one session when a cleric was killed by a charmed barbarian. Long story. Maybe another thread. My player decided that he wanted to shake things up; he was still pretty new and really wanted to play an evil character. I thought that it would be fun to have an evil character, and we fanagled his PC in by pretending that he was LN and wanted to help the party bring in a wanted criminal. Enter Og, the half-orc fighter with a great axe. Pretty smart for a  fighter, wants to climb the ranks of the police force and doesn't mind who he steps on to get there.\n\nThere is another PC in the party, whose name is escaping me, so we'll call her Aria. (I'll edit this in later when I remember what it is) Aria was an Asimar that didn't know she wasn't Human. Don't ask, I let my players write their backstories without much hovering. Aria's long-term goal in the game was to get married to a rich/powerful (preferably both) man and retire in luxury. Aria was also a racist. She hated anything non-human and would constantly crack jokes at the rest of the party who weren't humans, which was most of the party. The players of both Aria and Og didn't get along great; nothing hostile but they certainly weren't friends.\n\nWhen Og joined the party, Aria started in immediately about how dumb orcs are, how disgusting half-breeds are, and etc. Og bit his tongue and let her prattle on. The party started their quest and Og began taking snipes back at her. The bickering was entertaining and I did my best to keep the plot moving. A couple of secret rolls when the party was exploring a cave left Aria's horse frightened away from the party and her without much equipment, and a shit eating grin on Og's PC's face.\n\nNow the party was investigating the fortress/mansion of a local drug lord when they decided to split up and search the place. Some ridiculous shit went down, including amazing bluff checks to fool the kitchen staff, and Aria decided that the drug lord was a better prospect for striking it rich than turning him in for his reward. She changed out of her armor and put on her best party dress (which I regretably allowed to survive the horse's departure) and sprint past the party. Og saw her running past them in a hallway and asked \"Where's the stuck up bitch running to?\"\n\nAria's player flipped off Og's, which I immediately ruled as canon. Og didn't like that and took off after her. Aria turned a corner and decided to try and hide next to it, hoping first that he would run right past her, then, after a suggestion by me, realized what a bad idea that was, and told me that she wanted to trip him so she could get away.\n\nA bit of information that I intentionally left out: Aria is an oracle who took most of her feats and traits in social/spell casting areas. Not a fighter. Og? Og is a fighter. A fighter with massive strength and a hulking frame.\n\nAria rolls to trip in the surprise round as the rounds the corner, and doesn't manage to trip him. Og was carrying around a wine bottle he had found in the bar (of all places!) and decided that drawing his battleaxe to fight the whiney pathetic human would be a bit uncouth. He rolls to brain her with the bottle. Nat. Fucking. Twenty.\n\nThe party, who up until this point had been laughing and rolling their eyes, go dead silent. Aria already had some wounds on her, crap CON stat, and Og... well Og hadn't NOT killed anything he drew blood from. \n\nRoll to confirm... and he does. I look up breaking rules and roll for the glass's hardness... and it breaks over her skull. Og rolls damage and of course he rolls near maximum. So much that Aria is 1hp away from being dead dead. Immediately the players start calling for an alignment check, which I give them, and with a smirk say \"Nope, he's good. Still within the confines of his alignment.\" The LG monk had some major issues with that after he realized what I meant.\n\nThe rest of the story ends with Aria surviving and eventually taking revenge on Og by spiking his wine with hallucenogenic mushrooms.\n\nAnother story.",

        "text": "Quick little note. This part turned out much longer than any of the others. But it really is the best so far, imo. Also, theres a random spoiler tag in there for cabin in the woods. Not sure if those work on this sub.\n\n[Part 3]( http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2eo0kd/dd_how_we_screwed_the_world_part_3_the_rode_to/ )\n\nAt this point I had to miss a couple weeks in a row nothing much happened, other than the party running from a very weakened/almost dead lich, which damned the town it was under to zombiehood. Also, they made their way to Cuntopolis. During this one day journey they managed to accomplish three things: leave L'sindh behind in Dis Won, get the VAMPIRE captured by the undead-hating city guard, and get the goblin ranger killed. Which makes two character deaths for one player. From now on, im just going to refer to him as Leo, whatever character he has.\n\nNext session marked the birth of of Leo's next character, my triumphant return, and a special guest who was in town for a week and joined in the game for old times sake.\n\nAt this point L'sindh had no reason to catch up with the party of people she barely knew that had abandoned her. That is, until Mistress Glittertits offered her a deal. Bring her the wings of a pixie, and L'sindh could go free with the added bonus of gaining information to get home. And since she knew right where to find a pixie, she set off on the double.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the party was carefully constructing a plan to break their pixie vampire friend out of prison.\n\nWait, no, my mistake. that would be a SANE party, and what fun is that? Tevani was searching for the magic DooDad store, and the rest of the party was messing with the window of escape. Jump through it and you take no fall damage. Tons of fun was had.\n\nTevani cant find the store, since shops close early on sundays, but she does find Leo the magician/fence and Klepty, his sticky fingered business partner. Klepty of course being a higher-level-than-us changeling assassin thing designed to help break Lily out of jail, and happens to be the natural playstyle of our guest star.\n\nThrough various inferences they enlist these two to help, and retire to an inn to have dinner, rest, and begin plotting.\n\nAround this time L'sindh shows up at the city asking about the party. Locating their inn she finds Croven, asks the whereabouts of Lily, and immediately sets off to the jail, plan forming in her head.\n\nI would like to remind everyone at this point that L'sindh was not very fond of the group at this point, and it was being played as such. Besides, she didn't want them to know that she wanted to rip Luly's wings off. So OOC I did not tell them my plan. I knew that it might work, or it might go to hell because of the rest of the party's actions. No matter what, I knew it would be entertaining so I kept it a secret on purpose. And besides, I wouldn't have this story otherwise.\n\nL'sindh marched straight into the jail, right up to the front desk, and told them she was the vampire expert they had requested to take a look at Lily. After a little convincing she was let in to see Lily. After \"studying\" the subject she made her announcement. This vampire was a high ranking officer in the undead army and must be cleansed at a holy site, immediately. Interstingly, the only part the guard objected to was the time frame. After a little more lying everything was set. The guard would round up Lily's \"accomplices\" and would then take them all down to the holy site (the place we defiled last chapter). If L'sindh would like to go get dinner and then return, everything should be ready for their departure.\n\nAll this was done using notes to the Dm while the party constructed their plan, although, ingame, their plan happened during mine. Of course, their plan mostly amounted to have the assassin sneak in and break Lily out.\n\nFirst, Klepty tried the same tactic as L'sindh. She may have been a good theif, but was not much of a liar and quickly got threatened to leave and stop telling stories.\n\nNot to be deterred, this time she tried to sneak in. This did not work very well given it was a bright afternoon and the plaza was well lit. So she did the logical thing and summoned a cloud of shadows to hide in, so she could then run away from the \"suspicious\" guards. \n\nNot one to be deterred she tried once more, this time edging along the wall undetected. She was doing well until she bumped into a guard. Literally. He was standing quite close to the wall. \n\nWell, this time the guards had enough and captured her, throwing her into jail. At least she was in, finally. And her abilities could be put to use.\n\nOf course it would have probably been easier to walk in the front door. After all, the reception area was open at that time of day.\n\nAround this time the guard began looking for the group. They had a observer on them since they entered, so they were easy to find. The party, obviously, did not like where things were going and ran to hide in the sewers. There they hatched the brilliant plan to assault the jail head on. And they did just that. Charging in and past surprised guards. They used Tevani's cloud of darkness to great effect here.\n\nAfter some searching they find the \"undead ward\". At this point Tevani and Croven begin to feel more and more magic used for the cell doors. And Croven feels great evils around him. They find a kind of control room and hole up in it to figure out what to do.\n\nCut back to Klepty. Some guards come to let her out, since they mainly tossed her in a cell to teach her a lesson. To show her gratitude she knocks one out and stabs the other one in the back, changing into his shape. Then she also settles down to think.\n\nMeanwhile L'sindh is just finishing up dinner and is starting to walk back to the jail.\n\nThe main party, at this point, realized that the room they were in probably controlled the magical/mundane cell doors. And thats when Tevani's player shouted \"I push all the buttons\". Only Moo made any move to stop her, but he was too late. Every great and terrible beast captured over a long period of time was instantly released.\n\nEver seen the movie Cabin in the woods? If not, go watch it if you have [spoiler](/this basically resembled The Purge near the end of the movie.)\n\nThe evil included, but was not limited to, several powerful liches, and an ancient and SEVERELY pissed off dragon. Seeing this the party huddled in the room untill everything had passed, found which cell had Lily, and used a fancy magic item to warp out of there and back to Dis Won.\n\nL'sindh saw lots of chaos as she approached the jail, heard the beating of giant wings, and immediately turned around. She contacted Glittertits for instructions, as she had been given a way to do so for this mission. She knew what had happened and summoned a portal in the nearby river that would teleport L'sindh to the river near Dis Won. Not wanting to die, L'sindh jumped in.\n\nfor those keeping score:\n\nWorld: still 0\n\nOur party: 4\n\nLeo's character number: 3\n\nTO BE CONTINUED...",

        "text": "*Introduction... * \nAn [Atlantis: the Second Age](http://www.atlantisrpg.com) game\n\n***\n\nAll of the PCs (7 of them currently!) are in the town of Ife in southern Ophir. Ife is a trading city, situated along the river Kan, not too far north of the border with Pemba and not too far from the oppressive shadow of the Awalawan Jungle. The city normally does a brisk trade - either with the Pembans or by moving goods culled from the edges of the jungle or the Ophiran herds out to the coast. \n\nAbout two weeks ago (the end of Ayaru), hunters that normally bring game from the edges of the jungle began to report strange things. At first, tales centered around animals that they were sure they had shot were unable to be found. Then, finally, some hunters brought down a stag. Only, when they tracked the blood of the fleeing beast to find it dead, it got up and attacked them. The frightened hunters fled the jungles and returned to town.\n\nBy the time they reached Ife, the problem had grown. Dead things - mostly animals, but some humanoids as well - were walking south (south-west). This river of unnatural things had almost surrounded the city of Ife and some of the things walked through the city streets, making them dangerous for the townsfolk. \n\nEnter our Heroes.\n\nConducting a series of small experiments (courtesy of one of the Uluku Scholars and the Nemean Sorcerer), the Heroes discovered some interesting facts about the afflicted: they seem compelled to wander south but will veer off to attack anything that they can 'see/smell', their senses are not natural but can be blocked by a suitable quantity of stone or metal, enough bodily damage can bring down one of the walking dead as can a shot to the head (brain) or chest (heart), and things that die get back up within a short period of time. (Lots of Investigate and Lore rolls going on.)\n\nAfter some internal deliberation, the Heroes decided to take a boat and sail up-river. By venturing north, they reasoned, they could possibly find the source of the dead or at least determine the furthest extent of the causes. They know that there is a set of ruins near the head of the river Kan, some five days up-river. That will be their first destination. The dissenting opinion was that all these dead things were heading somewhere and that if the Heroes ventured to that destination, they could stop whatever was calling the dead south.\n\nThey load up some food, make sure their horses will be taken care of, acquired a boat and then headed north. They did their best to sleep on the barge boat, but such sleep was not entirely restful. The dead would occasionally spot them from the banks, but the river proved to be too swift to allow the dead to reach them. They did discover that there fish in the river were also affected by whatever strange curse had afflicted the area. \n\nFive days up-river and a few hours short of the ruins, the Heroes found a small bay off of the river. Probably used as a fishing spot by whomever lived here in the wilds as well as as a drinking hole by local animals, the small waterhole smelled of death. The once pristine water was cloudy and polluted. On the far side, away from the river, were a series of decaying bodies of Ahl-At-Rab. (Lots of Survival and PER and Tracking rolls in this bit.)\n\nThe Ahl-at-Rab bodies (there were 5 or 6) were not moving. None of them had visible external injuries, but a number of them exhibited signs of being crushed (constricted?) and at least one had had its skull crushed. The sixth body was under the water and held an obsidian dagger. \n\nThe pool is a natural vril site (or sits over one at least). Currently, the vril gathered in the pool is Void aspected. \n\nOne theory the Heroes put forth was that the Ahl-At-Rab fell prey to whatever is making the dead walk. The one with the obsidian dagger wasn't effected and fled to the pool. Perhaps he was a shaman and wanted the place of power to save himself. The others, already 'dead', showed up and he did some big magic to crush them all (or maybe summon some kind of creature to do so - a rhinoceros, a hippopotamus, or a giant boa) but wound up dying himself (perhaps because of his spell). \n\nWe stopped there. The Heroes facing the choice of trying to track down where these Ahl-At-Rab came from (over three weeks ago) or continue on to the ruined fortress a few hours away. Or, split up and do both.",

        "text": "So those who read my story about my groups method of dealing with the Herald of a demon lord may be able to tell that my group is a bit... Special. Several of us were already playing our characters as pseudo evil, even though none of us were officially \"evil\". Well, this is the story of how that changed. \n\nThis happened a few sessions after the demon story. Our party had recently returned from rescuing our wizard from hell. It was a grueling experience for all of us, but the wizard especially, since he was tortured for several weeks of game time by Orcus, Demon Lord of the undead, though to him, it felt like years. Aside from a fairly intense hatred of demons, it makes us all (again, the wizard especially) quite testy with those in game who are atheists/don't believe in hell. \n\nAfter escaping hell, we were on our way to the city of myself and another party member, where we had been going before Orcus decided to abscond with our wizard. Along the way, one of the party members needed to stop at a temple. I think he needed an atonement to use something, but I don't recall specifically. Either way, the gm tells us that the only temple nearby is a gnomish temple of Garl Glittergold (a gnome god). We go to the temple and start talking to the high priest. We come to find out that this priest, and indeed the whole church, refuse to believe in the existence of hell. Even after we explained to him that hell was quite real, we had just left it, he refused to believe it, and insulted our intelligence to boot (\"well I don't know where you were, but you couldn't possibly have been someplace that doesn't exist\" kinda thought). \n\nNow let me explain this. Me, and several other people in the group, absolutely effing hate gnomes. For me, it's partially that every gnome I've ever seen played was a colossal waste of space - for many of us, it also stems from our days playing World of Warcraft on the Horde side. Gnome mages pissed all of us off many times, since they were small enough to hide in the bushes, and usually did enough dps that by the time you figured out where they were, it was too late. So several of us had a preexisting hatred of gnomes to begin with. Now our characters were enraged, since this gnome was dismissing our blood sweat and tears due to blind devotion to his religion... And insulting us on top of it all. \n\nWe decided to prove to them, indisputably, that hell was quite real. So our wizard came up with a plan. We waited for their next church service to start. Then, me, our other rogue, and our swordsage sealed all the entrances from the outside. As we did that, the wizard began drawing a large circle around the entire church. After an hour preparing, he cast a spell. That spell was plane shift. We heard momentary screams from inside the church... Then silence, as the entire church, and everyone in it, was sent to hell. Bet they believe it's real now!\n\nAs a direct result, everyone in our party took a full step of alignment hit. Now I'm lawful evil, our other rogue and our swordsage are chaotic evil, and the remaining party members are varying forms of neutral. Amusingly, our wizard, who came up with the idea of sending them to hell, is now only neutral. What do you have to do to become evil then, right?  The other two... While they didn't actively participate, nor did they make any attempt to stop us. That's what they get for adventuring with the rest of us, I guess...",

I come in and offer to run the demo 5e game for them. Everyone joins, despite only 1 person with DnD experience (3.5).\n\nWe barely got to gameplay today as there was lots of walking people through character setup.\n\nAs I go around the room:\n\nA, the 3.5 veteran, is taking care of his own sheet well enough, so I leave him to it, just catch that he's got a sorcerer.\n\nK, wants to play an elf ranger. I work on getting him set up.\n\nB, thinks Drow sound cool and is working on a rogue. Oh, as is Neutral Evil - well someone has to be the stereotype.\n\nJ, (female, somewhat relevant) wants to play an elf druid. I set her up, but my spider senses are tingling.\n\nMe: \"Wait, A, what race are you playing?\"\n\nA: \"A High Elf (moon).\"\n\nMe: \"So 4 for 4 elves. Challenge Accepted. You all meet at a tavern in Neverwinter [brief description of Neverwinter and fielding many questions here] when a Dwarf hops up on a table and shouts \"I'm lookin' fer some o' you to guard mi wagon on the road t' Phandalin. It'll be ten gold fer each wen ye git it ther.\"\n\nWithout missing a beat, B: \"So can I roll to get him to give us more money?\"\n\n[explanation of persuasion here], rolls 7, so no.\n\nB, the drow rogue criminal (smuggler) talks to his contact and grabs a smuggling job to get an unmarked sachel out of the city without the guards noticing.\n\nMeanwhile, J, the high elf (moon) druid starts a bar fight just because.\n\nThey make it out of town ok, the satchel hidden in the wagon. All is well until the ambush, which the sorcerer walks right into and takes 5 damage for his trouble.\n\nThe party volley fires their bows at the goblins to absolutely no effect while the sorcerer runs back to the wagon and suceeds in wounding a goblin. The elf tries an intimidate and gets a \"Stupid knife-ears\" from the goblins for the low roll.\n\nEventually the party manages to down 2, after 1 near death so I have the goblins leave shouting \"Ahhh knife-ears have long-shanks!!\"\n\nWhich brings us to the end of shift. Episode 2 should have more.",

Nobody in the group asked questions. If a \"quest\" was given with a reward by someone high in society, they would do it. And like any dm, he used this knowledge.\n\nNext up we meet Mr. Moneyshot. He claims there is some kind of evil energies emanating from an artifact in the forest, and that we should bring it here to be studied. L'sindh knew this was bs, but she was promised help in her quest to return home, where she would be safe from repercussions. And so the party set off merrily into the woods.\n\nWe skipped happily through the woods until we found a shrine with a kind of orb in it. Unfortunately no one but our good paladin friend could pass a magical barrier. And he promptly does just that, stuffing the artifact into his pack.\n\nOverjoyed at this job well done we quickly started back to town, only to be stopped by some ominous whoooing. We shook it off and took a couple more steps. More whoooing, followed by several Owlbears bursting out of a bush and converting our paladin to a paste that could be easily spread on toast. Their job finished, the owlbears quickly fled.\n\nApparently that evil artifact we took was helping power the spiritual guardian of this forest. At its loss, this guardian bestowed what power it could to a bugbear to become its champion.\n\nThe remaining party grabbed the artifact and began to run back to town, only to be stopped by a goblin ambush, with the curious addition of a goblin wolf rider fighting by our side. Of course once you're killing goblins its hard to stop so Mooo took a couple swings at what turned out to be the paladins new character before we stopped him.\n\nAfter putting our differences aside we finally made it to town, handed over the artifact, took our reward, and, as tradition dictates, went shopping.\n\nSo, for a running tally, over the course of 2 in game days we've given a clearly evil being a piece of a ritual to summon hordes of something, AND have severely handicapped the power of a being that could protect us from those terrible somethings.\n\nWorld: 0\n\nOur MOSTLY GOOD party: 2 \n\nAnd of course we weren't done with the world yet.\n\nEdit: OWLbear. I dont know why I was thinking Bugbear.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED",

        "text": "I was visiting my hometown for a couple of weeks and some friends threw me a 4th edition one-shot. I had spent a few hours with the offline character creator and had a character I was really excited about.\n\nMy character was created about nine years before the story start by a circus gnome called Mad Marlin. Mad Marlin was a tinkerer who co-ran a sort of freakshow/oddity circus. He built a series of metal men, of which Max was the third. Put them up on display with signs that said, \"Meet Mad Marlin's Magnificent Metal Man! Marvel at the power of Electricity! Wonder at the force of Magnetism! Throw coins and watch them stick!\"\n\nThe first two metal men weren't sentient, really. And they didn't move much. Marlin hooked up generators and the like to them and fooled some people, but they were pretty bad. Until he came across the idea of binding a storm elemental into a power core. He did that, and the result was Max (Or the Magnificent Metal Man, Mark III).\n\nThe storm elemental in addition to the robot body's crude circuitry resulted in a sentient being. Max stayed with Marlin for a while, until his curiosity about this whole \"life\" thing got the better of him. He left, taking one of Marlin's power rods with him, and has been wandering and adventuring every since.\n\nIn game terms, he's a Warforged Storm Warden with a Lightning Greatspear (the stolen power rod acts a bit like a lightning lightsaber).\n\nAt the start of the adventure, Max and his party find themselves in the briefing room of the warship Invincible, flying flagship of the Imperial Fleet. The Empire is under assault by the Thexians, who have been systematically conquering every nation on the continent. Their main army spent a period of a few years holed up in some magically-unstable lands in the center of the continent, and when they emerged they were in control of an enormous floating warfortress called Sazerak. Sazerak is surrounded by endless winds and storms, so the vaunted flying fleet of the Imperials is rendered useless. With Sazerak, the Thexians are basically invincible. They've hired us to perform a mission of infiltration with the goal of bringing down the stormshields that protected the Sazerak. We're a primarily good party, and the Thexians lean toward evil in their empire-wide worship of the evilicious Bane, god of tyranny, fear, and hatred.\n\nThe rest of the party includes Max's little sister Morea (the Marvelous Mahogany Magician), who is a marionette infused with a nature spirit, a product of Mad Marlin's further experimentations with using spirits as personality and power sources. AKA a Hemadryad Artificer. The party is rounded out by a human circus-acrobat-turned-monk named Malen, and an extremely gay wizard whose name also starts with an 'M'. It's a thing.\n\nThe plan is to teleport the party into the fortress by means of a complicated ritual. The ritual is nearly disrupted when the Invincible is attacked by corrupted phoenixes, but the party holds them at bay until the surviving wizards can complete the ritual. From chaos and flame, Max and co find themselves in the relatively quiet heart of Sazerak. First thing to know about this cloud fortress: it's fucking huge. Enormous. It would take days to explore all the rooms and corridors. So even though it's got a bunch of Thexians on it, there are large stretches that are completely unlived in.\n\nWe begin investigating the ship. Something like this, we know there must be a control hub and power sources. As we begin to explore, we notice that there are these powered doors with openings directly into the magical circuitry of the fortress. They're filled with lightning, so most people would generally avoid them. Max, who is more than a little aroused by the giant storm fortress, decides that he wants to interface directly with it. After a check to see if his hands are straight up disintegrated, which Max rolls really well on, Max makes a connection with the fortress. The massive energy of the fortress fills him, until he's glowing brightly, his storm-elemental core filled to saturation. Things that get too close to him begin to melt, and best of all he's tapped into the awareness of the fortress. He can now track movements of Thexian troops, and has a decent idea of the layout of the fortress. As the party moves on, Max's awareness begins to fade, but when he needs to he recharges himself at new nodes.\n\nOn the way to where Max thinks the control room is, we come across a cohesive beam of light moving through ceiling and floor, and determine by experimentation with a eleven-foot-pole that said beam is basically pure energy and should really have a guard rail or something. Our now ten-foot-pole safely stashed away, we locate what appear to be some sort of control system--a room full of holes, with crystal rods arranged in a seemingly random pattern within. When we pull out and move a couple of the rods, the beam of mega-light shifts in diameter and focus and whatnot. It begins melting the ceiling, and then sort of explodes. Just a little bit. Loud enough that we can sense enemy troops coming to investigate. In a fit of inspiration, Morea the Artificer rigs up a trap with a slender tripwire attached to the ends of all thirty of the crystal rods. As we run from the scene, as Max's fortress-awareness fades, we can sense and hear the enemy soldiers running directly into the tripwire, pulling all of the crystal rods from their holes and setting off a massive explosion that blows a hole in the side of the ship.\n\nMaking our way to the control room, we fight Thexians on rain- and wind-swept battlements, exposed to the air and the fury of the stormshield. Their god Bane lends them considerable power, but monk, wizard, artificer and warden are able to take them out without much trouble. Their commander, a totally badass Orc, basically gets to do nothing as we hammer and daze/stun/prone him into the ground.\n\nWe soon make it to the uppermost floor of the fortress, which, surprisingly, has been made into a room for a little girl, or maybe an adult elf. Dolls, pink bedspread, stuffed animals, the whole deal. However, it seems like it hasn't been used in a while. Pushing our way through a concealed door, we came up to the power hub and control center for the entire fortress. The massive beam of light we had encountered was one of four power sources that fed a network of Science! tubes and switches and whatnot. In the center of this contraption is a fluid-filled tank, and floating in it, hooked to tubes, is a little girl, unconscious. Standing guard over her is an older man in power armor, and off to the side stands the wizard-general in command of the Thexians. The old man monologues for a bit, telling us how he was the scientist the made the Fortress Sazerak work, and while he isn't Thexian he works for them because they funded him and gave him the raw power he needs for his side project. You see, his daughter is dying, and Sazerak, in addition to being a giant warfortress, is also her life support. He resists our attempts to sway him to our side with promises that we could keep his daughter alive better than the Thexians, and activates his armor. The priest-wizard-general of the Thexians then introduces us to his most impressive soldier: a cataclysm dragon.\n\nA massive battle ensues. We knock out the old man, kill the Thexian general, and then eventually, slowly, wear down the cataclysm dragon with stabbings. It's insanely difficult to bring down, and has a storm aura that occasionally explodes at us. Max's lightning spear and abilities mostly heal it, so he has to resort to, ugh, non-lightning attacks. I honestly can't recall who gets the finishing blow, but there is much rejoicing when it dies.\n\nWe restrain and wake up the old man, and convince him to come over to side of the Empire, who we promise will supply the scientists necessary to keep his daughter alive, and to find a way to cure her. He shuts down the storm shield for us, and as the skies clear we see the distant fleet of the Empire move toward us. The fortress is, after all, still filled with Thexian troops, and they have a full army on the ground.\n\nAs we're turning away, intent on finding the cockpit so that we can fly the thing, Max stops and looks around. He's a little robot, sure, but the same storm that powers the Sazerak powers him. Saying nothing to his party, Max finds the primary control conduit, and sticks his arms in, attempting to gain enough control to fly the fortress. The DM asks for a roll.... shit. 7. Definitely not high enough. The power is too much, Max's control too slim, the power is too much for his little robot body to hold. His hands begin to fuse to control system--he's dying. There is one last chance... the DM asks for another roll. 19. The DM describes what happens: his body dying, his power center fusing to the fortress's, Max consciousness flees into the control nexus mixing with the insentient systems of Sazerak. His body dies, slumped against the control node, but as Max adjusts he realizes his new body is perfectly capable of handling the power within it. His senses open, and he can feel every hallway and room in the ship. He can feel the power conduits and flying mechanisms, the stormshield. Max has become Sazerak.\n\nThe one-shot ends with the rest of the group planning an ongoing campaign based around their adventures in their sentient floating fortress. Morea is ecstatic--it's not every day your big sibling becomes a giant floating fortress, and she's already planning ways of augmenting him. As I'm leaving the state again soon, it's a perfect way for them to segue into something long term, with Max becoming an NPC, their base of operations.",

It was unlike anything I‚Äôve ever seen before. The people started becoming‚Ä¶ *changed* by some kind of foul necromancy.‚Äù\n\nRagnar: ‚ÄúDisturbing. We‚Äôll need to look into this further. Until then, let‚Äôs make a pit stop in Jalsheim and give the griffons a rest.‚Äù\n\nThe large group descended from the air and landed just outside the city. Brodin was out there doing squats. Ragnar dismounted and walked over to him. The two men clasped forearms and had a bro moment.\n\nBrodin: ‚ÄúRagnar, old friend! What brings you to these parts?‚Äù\n\nRagnar: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre returning from a mission up in Horvik Bay. Nasty business. Lost two good men.‚Äù\n\nBrodin: ‚ÄúFallen Knights are always a tragedy. We‚Äôll give them a proper send-off.‚Äù\n\nBrodin ordered his guards to round up some of the townsfolk to help build funeral pyres. The Knights tended to their griffons while the two parties of adventurers talked amongst themselves. Lankoris pulled out the hilt he found in the tomb.\n\nLankoris: ‚ÄúSo, uh, Ulf, you said something about a sword? I found this in Ongvar‚Äôs coffin.‚Äù\n\nUlf‚Äôs eyes lit up as he took the shattered hilt from Lankoris.\n\nUlf: ‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ at last, we‚Äôve finally found the last piece. Now comes the hard part. The other things we‚Äôll need to reforge the sword are a bit harder to come by.‚Äù\n\nLankoris: ‚ÄúWhat are they?‚Äù\n\nUlf: ‚ÄúWell, the first thing we‚Äôre gonna need is a barrel of dragon‚Äôs blood to quench the blade in.‚Äù\n\nLankoris: ‚ÄúThat shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to find, right?‚Äù\n\nUlf: ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt pay attention in history class, did you, lad? That bloody hero Ongvar killed the last one over 200 years ago. As for the other thing we need, I‚Äôm not quite sure what it is, but legend has it that the elves once possessed something of great power during the Great War.‚Äù\n\nLankoris: ‚ÄúSo what will you do now?‚Äù\n\nUlf: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll split off here and wander around. See if we can find anything. I reckon the Knights are gonna need you.‚Äù\n\nAs the sun began to set, the pyres were completed, and the bodies of the two Knights were placed atop them. Ragnar approached the oil-soaked wood with a torch.\n\nRagnar: ‚ÄúIomedae, these two gave their lives in your service. We commend their souls to you. May they serve you in death as they did in life.‚Äù\n\nRagnar lit each pyre and everyone solemnly gathered around as the flames leapt into the air. They burned long into the night.\n\nThe following morning, everyone said their goodbyes to Ulf‚Äôs party and flew back to Asgaron. They landed in the large central tower that housed all the griffons.\n\nRagnar: ‚ÄúYou four have done well. Whatever we‚Äôre facing now, it‚Äôs damn powerful, and you‚Äôre going to need some damn powerful new gear to face it.‚Äù\n\nJizzard: ‚ÄúOH HELL YES!‚Äù\n\nRagnar led them to the Order of Retribution‚Äôs armory. There was a large, circular vault door covered in clockwork mechanisms. Ragnar placed his hand onto a plate in the center. It glowed briefly, then, with the clanking of many locks retracting, it swung open a little bit.\n\nRagnar: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, only Knights are permitted in the armory. I won‚Äôt be but a minute.‚Äù\n\nMe: ‚ÄúRagnar enters the vault and the door swings shut behind him, leaving you all awkwardly standing there waiting for him. It feels like when you were a little kid and your mom would leave you in the line of the grocery store to run off and get one more thing.‚Äù\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúGod, I hated that.‚Äù\n\nAfter a minute or two, the door swung back open, and Ragnar emerged carrying several bundles wrapped in cloth. He approached Lankoris first, handing him a bow designed to look like two stylized eagles.\n\nRagnar: ‚ÄúThis is Longshot. It was once carried by the legendary Ser Idaris. It is a powerful weapon, particularly lethal against the foes of Iomedae, such as the undead or demons.‚Äù\n\nHe then approached Amanduh and handed her a large shield with two large spikes sticking out of the bottom.\n\nRagnar: ‚ÄúThis is the Portable Bulwark. It has been used by many Knights to protect their companions from danger. While it is normal-sized now, it can be extended to the size of an average tower shield. The spikes can then be driven into the ground, forming cover for you or one of your allies.‚Äù\n\nHe then turned to Whisky and gave him a flask emblazoned with the Order of Retribution‚Äôs [sigil](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081006220152/pathfinder/images/7/79/Iomedae_holy_symbol.jpg).\n\nRagnar: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll admit, minotaur, I have never seen one fight as you do. One of the new recruits thought it would be funny to make holy beer as one would make holy water. As we Knights are sworn not to partake in drink, we have no use for this, but I think you might. If my guess is correct, once drunk, it should make you glow with holy fury.‚Äù\n\nAnd last, he approached the Jizzard and gave him a straight razor.\n\nRagnar: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll admit, we don‚Äôt have much that a halfling would be able to use. However, I was able to find this. The great Ser Arle once used this to shave. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find a use for it.‚Äù\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúSweet. Now, how are we going to find whoever killed everyone in Horvik bay?‚Äù\n\nRagnar: ‚ÄúSomething that evil leaves a trace in the world. If I assemble the Council, we should be able to pick up its trail. Come with me.‚Äù\n\nThe Grandmaster took them to the library where they got the map all those sessions ago.\n\nRagnar: ‚ÄúLibrarian, call a Council meeting. We have work to do.‚Äù\n\nRagnar then led the party to a circular room near the library. A ring of eleven chair surrounded a statue of the Order‚Äôs sigil. A few minutes later, the librarian entered the room, followed by nine of what appeared to be the Order‚Äôs oldest, most grizzled Knights. Ragnar and the ten other Knights took their seats and closed their eyes, meditating. The statue in the middle began to glow. Several more minutes passed, then the flow faded. The Knights all stood up.\n\nRagnar: ‚ÄúI can feel it. There‚Äôs a trace of the evil I felt in Horvik bay somewhere around the city of Magne. We must hurry.‚Äù\n\nThe party and all the old badass paladins mounted up and flew to Magne, a big elven trade city close to the borders of the Abjod. As I mentioned way back when in part one, the elves were Greek-inspired, and this city‚Äôs architecture showed the resemblance most of all, with buildings full of columns and stuff. Everything in the city seemed to be pretty kosher, with ordinary elves and the other races going about their daily lives. Baffled by the lack of evil in the city, the party retired to the inn, where they drank their fill and passed out in their rooms.\n\nThey awoke in the middle of the night to the sound of screams and crackling fire.",

This nearly results in splattered ork goo on the walls of my apartment.  Fortunately, we're distracted by a phone call.  Crumbles has a lead on a possible job, and I leap at the opportunity.  We decide to show as a group.  I call Elliot in, and have our decker bring me some makeup kits so I can not be pink.  \n\nThe makeup is not precisely correct.  I'm mostly green again, but I'm glittering.  This does not please me.\n\nThe meet is at a strip club, so we pile into the ride and make our way there.  The Mr. Johnson is a fat elf, and he's new to the game.  We're to snatch a script from a production of an action movie, without the director finding out we've done so.  \n\nOh boy.  Take a difficulty II mission and throw a Difficulty VII modifier on it.  Double that since we're not exactly specced for stealth.  \n\nWe've got a couple days for prep, and we actually spend them wisely this time.  Elliot is the lynchpin of this operation, and he runs the production company - and gets his deck fried adding me to the extras list.  Grand.  \n\nFourteen grand in fact, of parts and labor to repair the damn thing.  owwwww..   Even split four ways that's a pain in the wallet.  The damn thing distracts us for a good chunk of our prep time, and we're in a hurry when we figure out a second attack vector.  \n\nThe catering.  Their netsec is a lot weaker than the production company, and Elliot throws Hotentote and Crumbles onto their roster.  A couple calls to some shady street doc, and the plan comes together.\n\nI'm leaving out the part where the devil orc from the high school is hanging out with my landlord, Mama Warts.  I don't want to talk about it, and it didn't work anyway.  \n\nThe day of the filming dawns ugly and grey and miserable, a normal Seattle Saturday.  Phase one of the plan puts us in an alleyway, with me under the hood of the Americar, Hotentote doing his pile-of-rubbish imitation, and Crumbles and Elliot are under a coat in the back seat.  The caterer's truck stops shy, blocked in by our 'broken' car.  I play the dumb troll and con the guys into helping me, and they're pushing the Americar when Hotentote knocks one unconscious with a stun bolt and I gently zap the other one out with my shock glove.  \n\nPhase one ends with Elliot and me dropping the caterers off with the street doc to spend some time in a coma, and Crumbles and Hotentote driving the catering van to the film set.  Me and Elliot get back from the doc, and split up.  Elliot hangs out in a Soybucks nearby, and I go in as an extra.  \n\nPure Chaos.  \n\nThe set is buzzing with activity and people, and damn near crowded with Knight Errant goons.  I can't tell how many of them are actors and how many are the real deal.  I'm running around doing what I'm told like a good extra, Hotentote and Crumbles are serving something that's not _quite_ entirely unlike breakfast, and Elliot is on his thirteenth doughnut.  All is going well.\n\nThe original plan was to dope the food with a high powered laxative, cause a distraction and steal the script in the panic.  The likelihood of that working plummets when the director walks right past the food truck to his trailer, and comes out munching a burrito from his personal food supply.  Grand.  \n\nWe delay Plan A until lunch, which goes quite a bit better foodwise.  Crumbles and Hotentote don't completely mess up the sammiches, and the director still doesn't eat. Craaaaaap. \n\nTime for plan B\n\nPlan B is a simple B&amp;E.  In a rare moment of no-people, Crumbles bails out of the truck and hits the director's trailer.  The autopicker makes short work of the door and he's in.  The GM has been taunting us with the idea of stealing props and memorabilia, but thankfully Crumples doesn't buy it.  Instead of the entire crew, Crumbles doses the director's fridge and hits his terminal.  The snatch goes off without a hitch, and with the script on his Crumbles walks out of the director's trailer.  \n\nright into the arms of Knight Errant.  Fuuuuuuuuck.  \n\nThis is where the dice come into play.  Crumbles is normally a pretty suave guy, a fast talker.  Today he's a fumble-tongued idiot, and he's shortly frisked, looted, and on his way to a patrol car to go to jail.  Hotentote tries to intervene with words, but fails.  NONE OF THESE IDIOTS bother to fire up the commlink and call me, so I'm busily trying not to hit any other extras with my huge plywood prop axe.  \n\nHotentote sees one of the Knights Errant dudes fiddling with Crumbles' commlink and hears a beep.  He finally thinks to fire up the commlink and bring in the rest of the team.  Elliot checks Crumbles' commlink.  It's empty.  The stupid Knight Errant guy wiped his link.  There aren't even any of the 120 pictures of coffee he took last weekend.  The script is gone.  \n\nTime for plan C.  Hotentote's call alerted me just too late, and I arrive to see the squad car leaving.  The Knight Errant bastards took Crumbles' gear with them, so I can't pick the lock.  Hotentote can't leave the truck.  All we can do is wait.  \n\nThe waiting pays off, and the Director himself goes into his trailer during scene change.  Hotentote sneaks in an air spirit to watch, and the Director eats before sitting down at his terminal.  Yessssss!  \n\nThe Director comes boiling out of his trailer and beelines for the portapotties, Hotentote pings me, and I make my move.  The autopicker is with Knight Errant, so I go to punch the door open.  Thankfully Hotentote sees me and tells me the door is open.  Oops.  \n\nI throw the door open, jack in to the dude's terminal with my commlink, and Elliot does his thing.  This time he copies the script off my commlink to his deck, and I exit stage left.  \n\nThe rest of the day, with the Director stuck in the can, is mercifully short.  We get the caterers picked up, stuff them in their van covered in beer, and park it in the alley.  \n\nFree and clear and clean.  Elliot sends the script off to the fat elf, and we sit around waiting for the happy chirp of nuyen hitting our accounts.  \n\nAnd waiting.  \n\nAaaaand waiting.  \n\nThe bastard stiffed us.  I'm gonna do things to him.  Horrible things.  \n\nElliot and Crumbles managed to ebay the script for twice what we were going to get paid, but that doesn't matter.  This elf bastard is gonna meet the Pay Troll, and he's not going to survive the encounter.  \n\nOh, and Crumbles had a lot of fun in jail.  He got to spend an evening in the loving embrace of Huggy The Troll, a specialist in nonconsensual corporal cuddling - and no, that's not a euphemism.   He may recover.",

        "text": "Part 1 was mostly just to establish who the characters are, and give a little information about the setting. This is where the story really begins, although I will admit that its a bit slow to start. Thats just because group insanity levels had not yet reached critical mass. If you missed it, [Here's Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ek6qa/dd_how_we_screwed_the_world_part_1/)\n\nAlright, now its time for the real story. Not because i'm super important to the insanity that is my group, but since I wasn't there at first, I can't properly tell of the various deeds done in my absence. I wish I could, so I could properly explain why the drow witch had a scarf fashioned from a donkey penis that gave her +3 to intimidate. But I cant. Anyway, onward to plot!\n\nThe dm briefed me on what was going on, and we worked out a plan where I would be the assistant to the madame of a brothel that had summoned the party. We figured this would be a surefire way to get me involved in the game rather quickly.\n\nNope.\n\nSo while I may not have been playing, I did get to watch the group in action for the first time, and it was magical.\n\nThis session taught me that the one thing the group could **always** agree on was the necessity of shopping. Looking for anything interesting, to the point that Tevani became obsessed with a magical teleporting DooDad store. I watched in wonder as players tried ineffectually to haggle with shop keepers, almost never making progress. When Croven tried to threaten a shopkeeper he was cursed to have green skin that would eventually cause a very painful shedding period.\n\nEverything was examined for magicalness, and most was found to be mundane. But the group always had hope that maybe next time would be the big one, almost like lottery addicts. Of course, if it ever was super magical the merchants knew and jacked up the price.\n\nEventually, when all the stores had been gone over, Croven once again remembered that he was here to retrieve his kidnapped pony, goshdarnit, and they finally made their way to the brothel. Finally I could be a part of the game.\n\nWell, kinda. As soon as the party sets foot in the building several of them fall to seduction spells. They go off with their various ideas of beauty. Some of them do resist though and head up to meet the madame; Mistress Glittertits. Because what else would you name the owner of a brothel? (Again, I should point out that the players, for the most part, were given free reign over the names of people and places.)\n\nThe following conversation went like this:\n\nGlittertits: I see you received my letter. How good of you to come. I have a job for you.\n\nCroven: Where are you hiding my pony!?\n\nGT: Its safe, and I will return it as part payment for you to run a simple errand for me.\n\nCroven: Fine. What is it that you need?\n\nGT: I need you to go to the cave of wonder and retrieve a magic object for me. Its-\n\nLily: (interrupts by pulling out the golden dildo) Is this it? (Hands it to gt)\n\nGT: Youve already got it? But how did you know? Nevermind, here, since you do such good work I am going to refer you to the town mayor Mr. Moneyshot for your reward, and additional jobs.\n\nShe then called for my character, who stepped out of hiding, and sent me with a message to Moneyshot.\n\nThats right. They just gave the golden dildo, which they were told would be used to summon the hordes, to someone who was almost certainly evil. No qualms. And yet they were still suspicious of me because of how my character was introduced, thinking I was working with the DM to do plot things to them. Which was true, but that seems insignificant to them handing over a powerful magical artifact to someone they know is evil.\n\nAnd so, in one session, the mostly good party helped a BBEG get one step closer to their goal. It would not be the last time this occurred.\n\nTOO BE CONTINUED\n\n[Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2eo0kd/dd_how_we_screwed_the_world_part_3_the_rode_to)",

        "text": "This is the story of my most recent playgroup. We started in 4e dnd because thats all the DM knew, but with how the campaign's been going we're switching to 3.5. Some of the members are busy with work, so we're currently running an alternate campaign until we can all get together again, and I figured this would be a good time to record our previous adventures. So to start, some introductions:\n\n\nThe world: its a homebrew world that has no real limits for races available. The scenario we were dropped into was one of a war between nations that shared a peninsula of land cut off by mountains from the mainland. The war was between a living nation and an undead one, much like karnath from the eberron setting. We were on the living nations side. And thats roughly it.\n\n\nMe, L'sindh: I joined the group a couple sessions late. I was friends with everyone before, but had never really gamed with them. I made a psion that partially used her powers to convince clients that she was a prostitute. This was also used as a plot point since the group had just been hired by the madame of the brothel I worked in. My character was the only evil member of the party, and was a shadar kai trying to return home after being ripped from her plane.\n\n\nCroven: previously played with the dm and used his old character. Kept getting beat on as he was several levels above us, but eventually we evened out. He was a cleric in the service of bahumet, but had a bit of a problem with sticking to his vows until later on.\n\n\nTevani: A drow witch. Started off neutral/neugood, and fairly rapidly started to shift toward chaotic. Characterwise, she wasnt defined much by her race/class, but really amade it her own in the sessions.\n\n\nLily: Pixie vampire. In a campaign where we are in living territory, fighting the \"undead menace\". It went as well as you would expect.\n\n\nMooooo0oo: Dwarven barbarian. This was the players first rpg ever, so they set him up with something that has some easy cliches to follow, mainly that barbarians are dumb and can smash things. This went well while he learned how to play, and then his roleplay started to suffer as he understood the game more, and then got better as he learned even more. Also, he really likes cows.\n\n\n?: have you seen the gamers dorkness rising? If you have, this character basically has leon syndrome, so he's had quite a few already, and I dont remember all the names. But to start he was a good paladin.\n\n\nA final warning before getting on the the story: this is not at all a \"serious\" campaign. For example, while the DM did provide the world map, the players are allowed to name cities and major landmarks as we come to them. This gave rise to the capitol being named Cuntopolis by one of the female players. Serious roleplay and events certainly do happen, but stupidity and insanity happen just as frequently.\n\n\nAlright. As I said I didnt start out with the group, so I will try to give a quick recap of what I know of that time: they started out from cuntopolis on some generic quest, when Croven's donkey gets stolen. This leads them to the town of Dis Won after they receive a cursed letter offering a deal to get it back. While traveling there they stop at a cave and retrieve a magical golden dildo that is, according to its guardians, used as part of a ritual to \"summon the hordes.\" Eventually the get to Dis Won, which is where I joined the playgroup.\n\n\nIm still in the process of writing all this down, so for now:\n\nTO BE CONTINUED\n\nEDIT: [LINK TO PART 2 OF I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ekvhw/dd_how_we_screwed_the_world_part_2_the_beginning/)\n\n[Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2eo0kd/dd_how_we_screwed_the_world_part_3_the_rode_to)",

        "text": "We were playing a 6 player game (the maximum amount of players), all taking up the houses at random, which made for some interesting alliances.\n\nIn the North and East we had House Stark and Baratheon (Me) in an alliance to take the country.\nUnbeknownst to us Houses Greyjoy and Lannister had entered an Uneasy Alliance for the West.\nIn the South we had Houses Tyrell and Martell sitting around minding their own business, not really getting into any of the world affairs. We'll get back to them later.\n\nSo for the first couple of rounds the civil war in Westeros is quite, well, civil; little fighting and much consolidating of power and much more spreading of the forces.\nThen the Greyjoy's struck my allies the Starks in round 4.\n\nMost of the fighting took place in the areas around the Eyrie, and slowly it became apparent that the Lannisters were marching east towards Kings Landing, which I had taken in the previous round. My Stark allies forced the Greyjoys out of the Moon Mountains and quickly moved south to reinforce my position.\n\nThen I noticed something, the Stark's had become very close to becoming the most dominant force in Westeros (as soon as you control 7 castles you win the game), and his forces were in a perfect position to take Kings Landing from me and take the victory once we had driven off the Lannisters. It was decided that when the Lannisters neared, the Starks would attack with my forces supporting from King's Landing and Blackwater Bay. The air was tense, Stark had left Winterfell and the North with barely any troops, and the Greyjoys were once again massing on his border. He was gambling on this alliance and this victory against the Uneasy Alliance.\n\nHe gambled and lost. When the combat started and the combatants called for support, I answered... To the Lannisters.\nSuddenly the table fell silent as the Stark player sat back in his chair, wide eyed with rage. We then began to all laugh hysterically as the betrayal of the Baratheons sank in, all except Stark.\n\nStark lost half of his forces, and retreated back to the Eyrie. The Greyjoys and Lannisters in the next round or so rolled through and took the majority of his castles, although they could not penetrate Winterfell's defences.\n\nAt this point it was round 8 and a lot of resources had been spend in the war in the North.\n\nRemember the Tyrells and Martells? Yeah, we forgot about them too and quickly, the Martell's took Kings landing and drove my Baratheon forces back to Dragonstone.\nThe Tyrells had been taking the castles in the south and was bordering on victory as he struck against the Lannisters, taking the Blackwater and cutting up the middle of the Lannister lines.\n\nThe Uneasy Alliance, which now included the Baratheons, tried to push back but the unwavering supplies of the Tyrells and Martells supporting each battle forced us back too far.\n\nIn the end, the Tyrell's took the Iron Throne, supported fully by the Martells.\nMy Baratheons had been ousted from Dragonstone and forced to move to the areas surrounding Blackwater Bay, which remained in my control.\nThe Lannisters were left penniless.\nThe Greyjoys had more land than they started with, so that was a win on their part.\nAnd the Starks. He's still bitter about the betrayal outside King's Landing.",

        "text": "Below is a side story written regarding several NPCs in a campaign that has been running for 15 years now. Our group from time to time writes up scenes that happen between sessions or that didn't involve the PCs at the time. All, save Lady Pain, are NPCs created from PCs or because of PCs in our campaign (hence the Archmage of Sigil not being the same person as they are now).\n\nTL;DR: Just a side story, take it for what it is\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\"Lady Kerona...,\" the archmage spoke out of surprise as the elven noble came into view blocking his exit from the alley into the Lady's Ward.  Merrick was using what he considered the private \"back door\" of his tower, something he had done for decades in an attempt to avoid transversing among the less desirable residents of the Cage, along with any chance of being ambushed by travelers to the city seeking information about this and that, and especially, what he knew this meeting would have to bring.\n\n\"You seem surprised to see us, Atrius,\" the woman smirked as she glanced slyly with silver eyes through her shoulder length auburn hair as she rested one hand against the wall and another at her waist.  As with all elves, she was the model of exquisite beauty, but what differed was a distinct air of a predator.  On this day she was adored in modest dress, only a single dimly lit pendant to signify any sort of wealth, or to him, magical power and control.\n\n\"Us?\" he quickly surveyed before turning to what he was expecting to be the still open secret passage back to safety; a route now thwarted by the presence another elven figure.  This was a tall slender well dressed man with long black hair, and to the contrary of his companion, he carried the feel of regal authority; a presence that commanded respect.\n\n\"Where is the book, Lord Draconus?' he spoke with a low tone as he approached.\n\n\"Lord Baelmah, a pleasure,\" the archmage gave a slight mocking bow.\n\n\"Did really you think you would escape Union City...,\" he began.\n\n\"...and the Gleaners would not come find you?\" she finished approaching from behind the mage, running a hand from one side of his shoulder to the next in a playful manner, evoking a feeling less than pleasurable.\n\n\"Union is destroyed,\" Merrick turned his both shoulders to his assailants keeping them firmly in view, \"your organization is finished.\"\n\n\"Finished?,\" she took a hold of his jaw firmly than closed all personal space in an instance leaving only a breath to separate them.  Her pendant began to glow intensely and a feral coldness washed over him, \"you stole from us again, Atrius...\"\n\n\"The book didn't belong to the Gleaners,\" his spoke breaking free of her icy grasp, \"nor it's vault of trapped relics.  It was the Order's of the Book's...\"\n\n\"If the the city was lost,\" Baelmah calmly began, \"it was agreed that the Book would be sealed away in the Gleaner's Vault to avoid it falling into the wrong hands.  Something you decided to reneged on...\"\n\n\"You mean something I didn't agree on,\" he shot back, \"The book is the greatest source of arcane knowledge ever compiled:   Elminster, Mordenkainen, Melf, Halaster, Szaz Tam, Manshoon...\"\n\n\"...even our little Merrick,\" she laughed, \"You really think you are anything to the greats of the arcane? You are the archmage of a city that doesn't even care if it has one.  I would be surprised if the Lady of Pain even knows you exist...\"\n\n\"Let's not forget a human first in his class at Myth Drannor,\" Baelmah spoken slightly more respectfully in Kerona's direction, before chuckling a bit himself, \"though it makes little difference if the city and academy were destroyed by demons before you have a chance to graduate.\"\n\n\"...but you had nothing to do with that, just like Union, did you? Had nothing to do with destruction that also followed you to Meridian.\" she growled a bit before slapping him across the face an impact that left him stunned,\" Had nothing to do with leaving our Sehlae behind to die...\"\n\nMerrick fell to his knees in pain.  At first it wasn't pain of the physical sense, but an emotion agony that comes only with centuries of guilt, but as chill retook him it was clear the maneuver was also a clever method of one of her cold spell's deliveries.  He would need to retreat deep into his subconscious if he was going to overcome its effects. \n\nHe went to his own history remembering that he was born Atrius, a noble of House Draconus, son of the archmage of the now fallen City of Meridian.  In its day it was the beacon of human ingenuity, now the realm, like his city, was just a charred remain of its former glory due to the ravages of countless wars.  It was these elves of House Alean-Amitore, that first visited the city from beyond the planes and spoke of the wonders of the plane of Toril and great academy of Myth Drannor.\n\nIn those days he was never too sure why elves of Faerun had traveled to his realm, nor the true reason for their insistence that royal Alexander family appoint an apprentice mage to travel back to the academy with them.  It had always been his dream to travel the planes and learn great arcane secrets beyond his father and home, but instead of pride, the memory of this time and place, only brought torment.\n\n\"Ageless,\" Baelmah spoke breaking the trance, \"I once thought it foolish that the late goddess actually granted you with youth of the elves, but now I see it was a proper payment for your selfish arrogance; cursed to remember all those you care for slip into oblivion by your own agenda.\"\n\nHe continued to knell, almost frozen by his lack of emotional fortitude, an ambush of his mental fortress that he did seem to have the strength to combat; too many selfish machinations had those around him been forced to endure...\n\n\"You used to be so beloved among all you graced,\" Kerona leaned in, her pendant flickered, as another wave of cold washed over Merrick, \"and even against our pleas she still couldn't see you for the monster we knew you would become.\"\n\n\"This isn't about Sehlae,\" Merrick forced through great assertion against the spells hold, \"it never has been.  I waited at the portal until the very ground around me crumbled, and only when I could no longer hold back the demons of the Abyss was I pulled through to the other side...\"\n\n\"It should have been you,\" Kerona screamed, the pendant around her neck began to glow with an intensity of Avarice itself, and he knew in that moment what would come next would be his end should he not act in his one last moment of clarity.\n\n\"There isn't a day that goes by that I don't relive that nightmare,\" Merrick fired back mustering just enough strength stand and in a blinding instant he snatched Kerona by the throat, necklace and pendant firmly in grasp, with his free hand began summoning a large leather bound tome that began to pulsate with arcane energy, \"but how dare you make this about her, you cold witch.\"\n\nFighting free of his grasp, Kirona was forced to abandon her implement to avoid the coming explosion.  Flames erupted from Merrick's form, sending not only the woman retreating out of the alley, but the gentleman forced to summon a shield of pure energy just to avoid the volcanic onslaught, that even in his protected state, forced his back to the wall.\n\n\"This book,\" Merrick emerged from the flame standing, \"is not worth the trouble it has caused those that have possessed it...\"\n\nThe two elven mages looked on at the archmage in shock, he held the \"One Book\" in the direction of the Kirona, pages seeming to turn on their own, and her pendant, now transformed into its catalyst orb form, at the gentlemen; both implements awash with arcane energy.\n\n\"So I have decided,\" the books pages raced to the end of the time, \"that you're right and that this book doesn't below in anyone's hands...\"\n\n\"NO!\" the two elves of Alean-Amitore screamed with hands out reached, \"you'll attract her...\"\n\nThe sounds of their pleas were muffled as the incantation began to take a hold, energies of countless centuries of knowledge began to cascade over the area as reality itself began to bend and shift.  The alley began to peel and then crumble as Merrick began to float skyward with the book.  \n\nSurely they will come, he thought to himself as he looked out onto the city, and they did.  As the spell began to take hold on its surroundings he could see the robed forms of the dabus race in the direction of the Lady's Ward to repair the the damage that was being caused.  He needed to think quickly, the goal was only to get rid of the book, not himself, permanently, but any further damage to the city would ensure both.  Floating up to greet him, the dabus grasped at him with arms outstretched, above their heads danced the symbols of warning; he knew it was about time to end this little show.  \n\nFinishing the incantation he released the book to continue its magical ascent, with the dabus' city repairing powers in pursuit; he himself left to free fall only momentary.  A moment interrupted by an unexpected explosion of arcane energy, that while quenched in an instant by the cancelling hands of dabus, was enough to send the archmage plumenting into the cobbled streets below with a near fatal impact.\n\nMerrick came to moments later just outside the alley he had began, by now the elves of Alean-Amitore has long retreated, and even the phantasmal terrain he had evoked on the the ally to attract the dabus had began to fade, a feat a trickery that only The Book could have accomplished within the Cage.  He lay for moment, vision blurred, yet he swore he could hear the muffled sound of gasps through his still ringing ears. Surely a great deal of passersby were left impressed, or shocked, by his display and apparently survival.\n\nRegaining he forced himself into a slump as he began to recover. It was at this time he noticed through the numbing haze a towering figure lingered over head, and even as his vision began to clear, the pain still remained.  \n\n\"Well looks like those Gleanors were wrong after all,\" Merrick continued to look at the ground, \"and besides it's not like I could have just walked up to them and handled them the book...\"\n\nThe figure began to move and it would seem all too ironic that he would have to go out with a sarcastic response, but there was only silence as She moved on...\n\n",

        "text": "This week, none of our group's GMs (including me) were ready to run their usual games, so I spent half an hour throwing together a scenario in a system I've been wanting to play for a while. This is Dogs in the Vineyard.    \nA quick explanation of the conflict system:    \nEach party involved rolls a number of different-sized dice according to their relevant stats, traits, equipment and relationships. They then take turns Raising (putting dice forward and describing an action) and Seeing (putting dice forward to match the Raise). Depending on how many dice you use to See, you might Reverse The Blow (one die), Block or Dodge (two dice) or Take The Blow (three or more). The less dice, the better.    \nIf you find yourself unable to See anymore, or if it just makes sense, you may Escalate. For example, an argument may turn to a fistfight, and then someone may pull a gun. These are Escalations.    \nThe system can handle multiple parties in a conflict quite easily, but we kept it simple tonight.\n\n**The Cast**    \nBrother Bartholomew, who preferred to go by Bill. Pudgy, warm and steadfast, Bill was the heart of the group. He was afraid of blood, and his coat was stained with it. Otherwise, quite willing to get his hands dirty.    \nBrother Eli, who hadn't carried a loaded gun since being forced to execute his and Bill's possessed Temple Instructor while Bill bound him with sacred earth and prayer.    \nBrother Freduardio, a convert from far South. Carried a gun but never used it: \"Too much killing done already.\"\n\n**The Arrival**    \nDry earth and grass cracked beneath twelve horseshoes as the young Dogs rode in to Antioch Plains, a small branch making their living off livestock.\nThe people gathered around, welcoming the distinguished visitors. A woman offered a baby up to Brother Bill, who misheard her and Named the child 'Clarence'. Thankfully, when a Watchdog makes a mistake like that, the mother takes it as a blessing, praising the slightly bewildered man for revealing the baby's true name.    \nIt's not long, however, before trouble arrives on the heels of a wailing woman.\n\n**Victor and Wiley**    \n\"Someone must stop them--oh, praise be, it's the Dogs! Please, I think Brother Victor and Brother Wiley are going to fight!\"    \nThe Dogs mount up and ride towards a stable, where they intercept a well-built young man making a beeline for another young man, completely unaware and apparently composing poetry.    \nBrother Eli takes the reigns. *What's at stake: 'Do Victor and Wiley punch on?'*    \nEli: Raise - Eli pulls his horse up alongside the young man, draws his revolver and says, \"Hold it right there.\"    \nVictor: Block - \"Stay out of this,\" though he stops advancing.    \nVictor: Raise - \"What goes on between me and Wiley is our business.\"    \nEli: Reverse The Blow - \"I'm afraid it's not that simple, son. You know who we are?\"    \nAt this point, young Brother Victor finally notices the tell-tale coats, mailbags and jars of consecrated earth. His eyes widen and he Gives.    \n\"Now what's all this about?\"    \nVictor leads them to a more private patch of dirt, and the Dogs get him to spill the beans. Turns out that Victor and Wiley have been the best of friends all of their life, but lately they've been fighting over one Sister Arina, the daughter of a farm owner by the name of Brother Parner. Parner won't let his daughter leave the house because he believes that it's too dangerous. The Dogs note this as being the origin of the trouble, most likely. Victor confirms it immediately, telling them that Arina's mother has been going behind Parner's back to sneak her daughter out so that she can accept suitors, as an unmarried woman should.    \nFor those unfamiliar with this system: Brother Parner believes that he knows better than the scriptures when it comes to his daughter's duties. That's Pride, which creates Injustice when Sister Arina can't fulfil her duty to accept suitors. The part where it gets really dicey is Arina and her mother's Sin of deceit. Sin is what lets demons attack the place. Right now, they seem to be manifesting as deteriorating relationships - Brothers Wiley and Victor especially.    \n\n**Brother Parner**    \nThe three troubleshooters ride on Brother Parner's farmstead, into the fields. On the way past the house, Brother Freduardio catches a vision of Sister Arina through the window, and understands fully what all the fuss is about. He might consort with demons himself for a chance with a creation as enrapturing as Sister Arina.    \nSo when Brother Bartholomew begins talking to Brother Parner, who is shovelling cow shit, Freduardio cuts him off and starts off strong.    \nWhat's at stake: *'Sister Arina's Freedom'*    \nFreduardio: Raise - \"You cannot constrain your daughter like this. It is against the scriptures.\"    \nParner: Block - \"It's not safe for her out here!\"    \nParner: Raise - \"Let me tell you a story. You know about Antioch Plains? Last time we had a band of Dogs out here, they exorcised a demon from a young man. But not before he murdered a young lass that he was courting. They were such a pair, destined to be wed! And he killed her! I won't let that happen to my Arina.\"    \nFreduardio: Block - \"That is not your decision to make, you do not have the authority.\"    \nFreduardio: Raise - \"In the name of the King of Life, I command you to release Sister Arina so that she may fulfil her duty as a woman!\"    \nParner: Take The Blow - \"But--\"    \nParner: Escalate - \"A father has the highest authority!\" he swings his shovel up at Freduardio, who Blocks by catching it, then Raises and snaps the handle over his knee before laying the jagged ends to Parner's throat.    \nParner Takes The Blow, knocking the improvised weapons aside but tripping and gashing his forehead on a rock. Out of dice and unable to Escalate, he Gives.    \n\"Fine! Take her!\"    \n\n**A Job Well Done**    \nBrother Bill becomes ill at the sight of Parner's wound and trots off to catch a breather. Deciding that \"Ay gurl, I just whooped your dad in a fight\" wouldn't be the greatest icebreaker, Freduardio and Eli ride for the Steward's office, to deliver the mail and new doctrine.    \nThey are greeted warmly, though Eli instantly takes a dislike to the harmless-seeming fellow. Steward Barlow asks them if they've heard about the plight of Sister Arina.    \nEli, smugness in his tone, begins to say that it's taken care of, but is cut off by the almighty sound of a rifle's report coming from the direction of the Parner property.    \nBarlow raises his eyebrows, \"Are you sure about that, brother?\"    \nEli gently pushes the Steward back inside and closes the door on him.    \nEli turns to Freduardio.    \nFreduardio turns to Eli.    \n\"I...don't like guns much.\"    \n\"Yeah, neither do I.\"    \nSo they make their way to the inn and grab a drink.    \n\n**Showdown**    \nSo it's left to poor hemophobic Bill to step up to the plate. Without hesitation, he brings his horse around and rides hard for Brother Parner's house. When he arrives, the scene is this:    \n- Victor and Wiley, side by side, backing away from the house with their hands up.    \n- Arina, on her knees on the verandah with a revolver to her head.    \n- Parner, revolver in one hand, rifle in the other, raving about demons. Bill's demon-senses are tingling pretty hard on this one.    \nWhat's at stake: *'Sister Arina's life'*    \nParner: Raise - \"Get back, demons! All of you! You'll not take my little girl!\"    \nBill: Block - \"Nobody's taking your little girl, Brother Parner.\"    \nBill: Raise - \"She'll leave of her own free will, won't she?\"    \nParner: Block - \"Silence, devil in disguise!\"    \nParner: Escalate - He raises the rifle and fires.    \nBill: Take The Blow - He dives for a solid-looking pig stall, but Parner's shot obliterates a key support, sending the whole thing tumbling down and leaving Bill in the open.    \nBill: Raise - Bill raises his arms, forming the Sign of the Tree with his gun sitting on one palm and the Book of Life on the other. He stares down the shell called Brother Parner and names it truly:    \n\"The only devil here is you, Asmodia.\"    \nThis turns out to be a mistake. The demon takes full possession of Brother Parner, which means it gets to roll more dice. His pupils dilate until there's nothing of his eyes but blackness, and the mouth twists into an ungodly snarl.    \nParner/Asmodia: Reverse the Blow - He thrusts his hand out into a vicious claw, \"Yield before me, dog! Yield!\"    \nHonourable, steadfast Bill, with no dice remaining, must Give. The only movement he can make is to tilt his hand, dropping his Book which smoulders in the dirt.    \nAsmodia pulls the trigger on the revolver, spattering the wood with Sister Arina's head parts.    \nBill's player rolls his Fallout Dice and comes up with 20.    \nAsmodia advances on Brother Bartholomew and places his hand upon his head: \"Die.\"    \nThe last thing Bill sees before death takes him is Asmodia casually executing Brothers Victor and Wiley, before heading downriver to Antioch Plains' blessed waterfall, which is said to be their vessel of Faith.    \n\n**Duty**    \nBack in town, Freduardio and Eli hear multiple gunshots.    \n\"I think Bill's in trouble,\" Freduardio offers.    \nEli's player looks at his character sheet: 'Before the shooting starts, I've already left town 1d8'.    \n\"He's in a better place now. Anyway, time for me to skip town.\"    \nThey both mount up. Eli books it to the next branch on his route, whereas Freduardio gallops for the Parner farm.    \nHe takes in the carnage quickly, notes a trail of dripping blood, and follows it downriver.    \nWhen he comes to the waterfall, he finds Asmodia facing the drop, on his knees making obscene gestures and chanting in an arcane tongue.    \nWhat's at stake: *'Does the waterfall become tainted?'*    \nFreduardio: Raise - A smiting fist, aimed for Asmodia's head.    \nAsmodia: Block - Parner's body spins with supernatural speed and catches the blow.    \nAsmoda: Raise - He grabs Freduardio and throws him back fifteen meters or more, then runs full-tilt towards him.    \nFreduardio: Block - Still sliding backwards, throwing up dirt and grass, he thrusts out his hand, \"In the name of the King of Life, I command thee Asmodia to halt!\"    \nAsmodia stops in his tracks, temporarily unable to move at all.    \nFreduardio: Raise - Raising his copy of the Book of Life, Brother Freduardio begins reciting verses of banishment. The Book glows with a brilliant light, washing over the demon before it.    \nAsmodia: Take The Blow - Half the skin on his face burns off, before;    \nAsmodia: Raise - He manages to draw his revolver again and get off a shot.    \nFreduardio: Block - The bullet strikes his Book, ricocheting into the dirt. The Book stops glowing.    \nFreduardio: Raise - He drops the Book and pulls his revolver, cocking the hammer and opening fire. The bullet's blast sounds like angel choir, and the muzzle flash is holy light.    \nAsmodia: Take The Blow - The slug tears Asmodia's right arm clean off - tainted blood flows freely.    \nAsmodia: Raise - In one last, desperate attempt, the demon throws himself at the Dog, mouth expanding into a man-eating demonic maw.    \nFreduardio: Reverse The Blow - At the last moment, he throws his jar of consecrated earth into the mouth of Asmodia.    \nThe sound of breaking glass gives way to choking and screeching, until the demon's mouth shrinks once more to a normal size. The snarl fades into an expression of shock and shame, and the pupils contract until the dying face on the ground is that of Brother Parner again.    \n\n**Aftermath**    \nBrother Freduardio is hailed as the hero of Antioch Falls - the branch is renamed in his honour.    \nNone learn of Brother Bill's selflessness and mercy, though he is given a touching funeral.    \nEli, the Coward, loses the protection of the Faith, and is beset by demons on the road. They come in the form of highwaymen, and he is robbed and killed.    \n\nPS: It seems like Brother Eli's player didn't actually get to do much, but he had a much bigger part in character creation, and his player is one of those people who will happily sacrifice the spotlight for the sake of pacing.\n\nEDIT: Small correction - Eli was the one who drew on Victor - he had the fastest horse so he arrived first, and even though he never carried a loaded gun, he did like to use his unloaded one for purposes of intimidation.",

        "text": "Part 8: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2cetac/doing_all_the_wrong_things_for_all_the_right/\n\nAfter their shenanigans in the Lantern King‚Äôs realm, Whisky found a note in his pocket that read, ‚ÄúIf you want to find me again, just play a really good prank on someone.‚Äù\n\nThe Jizzard put the ring on his dick.\n\nAt long last, the *Lucky Maiden* and the *Manowar* pulled into the docks of Horvik Bay. It was sort of a Riften-esque city, with wooden buildings closely packed together near the docks.\n\nIt was completely empty.\n\nThe party got off the ship to try and find where everyone went. The streets were completely devoid of people, and an eerie quiet had settled upon the city. Whisky and the Jizzard went into the general goods store to see if anyone was there while Amanduh looted one of the nearby houses and Lankoris climbed on top of said house to get a better vantage point.\n\nWhisky walked up to the store‚Äôs front desk.\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúHello? Anyone home?‚Äù\n\nThe shopkeeper lunged up from behind the desk and grabbed on to Whisky. Blood was running out of his eyes and mouth, and he uttered an inhuman screech.\n\nJizzard: ‚ÄúGah! What the fuck? He‚Äôs a zombie! Punch him!‚Äù\n\nThe shopkeeper tried to sink his teeth into Whisky, but he was able to throw the shopkeeper to the ground and curb-stomp him, splattering the Jizzard with gore.\n\nOther undead townsfolk began stumbling out of their hiding places. Several entered the house that Amanduh was in, as she was making a great deal of noise throwing things around inside. Whisky and the Jizzard rushed to help her while Lankoris covered them from the roof, taking pot shots at any that got too close.\n\nAfter dispatching the undead townsfolk and thankfully avoiding being bitten by them, the rest of the group climbed onto the roof with Lankoris.\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if we can get to the center of town to draw them away from the docks.‚Äù\n\nThe party began jumping from roof-to-roof, sailing over the narrow alleyways. However, after a few jumps, Lankoris horribly botched his acrobatics roll. He was a few buildings ahead of the rest of the party, and hanging off the side over a swarm of undead. Just as he was about to lose his grip, a cloaked figure appeared above him and grabbed his hand, hauling him back onto the roof. The person‚Äôs figure was undeniably feminine, but the hood of the cloak obscured her face.\n\nHooded woman: ‚ÄúQuickly, follow me if you want to live.‚Äù\n\nThe woman guided the party across the rooftops, eventually leading them to the central square of the town, where long boards of wood were being used as improvised bridges to the inn at the center. She ushered them across and opened a trapdoor on the roof of the inn.\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúShould we trust this person?‚Äù\n\nLankoris: ‚ÄúDude, she wouldn‚Äôt have saved my life if she wanted to kill us.‚Äù\n\nThe party followed the woman down, and descended a few flights of stairs to get to the bar. The doors and windows were heavily barricade from the inside. There, they found the hooded woman, as well as a bald dwarf with a braided beard, a robed halfling with eyeglasses, and a Knight of Retribution in full armor. The woman pulled back her hood, revealing that she was a reasonably attractive elf.\n\nNot-so-hooded elf: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you came. My name is Eden Leafblade.‚Äù\n\nBespectacled Halfling: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm known as Wolfgang.‚Äù\n\nKnight: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Ser Kjoldi.‚Äù\n\nBald Dwarf: ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm Ulf Berht.‚Äù\n\nAmanduh and Whisky began cheering. Eden, Wolfgang, and Ulf were our characters in one of the previous campaigns I mentioned in chapter one.\n\nEden was Amanduh‚Äôs old character, a super sneaky rogue who was skilled with throwing knives. She didn‚Äôt talk all that much.\n\nWolfgang was Whisky‚Äôs character. He was a sorcerer that hailed from a monastery of monks who protected a mysterious power source known only as ‚ÄúThe Dub‚Äù. He learned to channel the Dub through his body into powerful sonic attacks that made lots of ‚Äúwub‚Äù noises.\n\nUlf was my character. He was an expert blacksmith who was exiled from his homeland after he was framed for a crime he didn‚Äôt commit. He specialized in hitting things with his hammer and had a really thick Scottish accent.\n\nSer Kjoldi was just there.\n\nThe three of them were on an epic quest to find the pieces of a shattered magical sword so that Ulf could reforge it. Unfortunately, it just kind of‚Ä¶ fizzled out right when things were getting interesting and the DM stopped organizing sessions. I decided that one way or another, that story was getting closer.\n\nAmanduh: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go flirt with the elf. She looks hot.‚Äù\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get some booze from behind the bar and drink with Wolfgang. He seems like a pretty cool dude.‚Äù\n\nJizzard: ‚ÄúMe and Lankoris will go talk to the dwarf and the paladin.‚Äù\n\nLankoris: ‚ÄúSo, what are you doing here?‚Äù\n\nUlf: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on an important mission. We‚Äôve been searching all over the world for the shards of a certain blade. We‚Äôve found several pieces already, and we have reason to believe that the final piece is somewhere around here. For the past few weeks, we‚Äôve been scouring the surrounding countryside. About a week ago, people in the town started getting sick.‚Äù\n\nKjoldi: ‚ÄúI tried to heal as many people as I could, but after a few hours, the disease is beyond my control. Before long, people started dying, only, they didn‚Äôt stay that way. My squad and I fought back the hordes of undead to buy the survivors some time, but now we four are all that‚Äôs left.‚Äù\n\nWolfgang: ‚ÄúGood thing you guys came along. With your help, I‚Äôm sure that we could find some way to get out of this gods-forsaken city.‚Äù\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúI have an idea. I go back behind the bar and look for the strongest drink I can find.‚Äù\n\nMe: ‚ÄúYou find several bottles of‚Ä¶ well, dwarven whisky.‚Äù\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúI get some rags and put them in the necks of the bottles.‚Äù\n\nMe: ‚Äú... Add five molotovs to your inventory.‚Äù\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúOkay, everyone, I‚Äôve got a plan. Lankoris, Wolfgang, and I will go near the docks and create a distraction while the rest of you escape. We‚Äôll catch up to you.‚Äù\n\nLankoris: ‚ÄúSounds good. It‚Äôs about nightfall, so let‚Äôs rest and start the plan at dawn.‚Äù\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúUntil then, let‚Äôs get drunk!‚Äù\n\nMorning came, and the two parties climbed onto the roof. The distraction team made their way over to the houses closest to the docks. Wolfgang rolled up his sleeves and began waving his hands around. Powerful sound waves blasted out of his palms, creating a huge amount of noise and drawing just about all the zombies in the city. Lankoris started thinning out the crowd with his arrows, but a large swarm of undead quickly gathered around the building.\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúI light my molotovs and throw them.‚Äù\n\nMe: ‚ÄúCongratulations. Now you have flaming zombies. Also, the house you are standing on is now on fire.‚Äù\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúRight, wooden buildings. I probably should have thought that through. Let‚Äôs run.‚Äù\n\nThe three of them began roof-hopping to the other side of town. Thankfully, the burning houses kept the majority of the zombies‚Äô attention, and they were able to outpace the stragglers that followed them. Eventually, they caught up to the other group.\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs move quickly. We kinda set the town on fire.‚Äù\n\nJizzard: ‚ÄúOh, hey, does anyone here know where that guy Ongvar was buried?‚Äù\n\nKjoldi: ‚ÄúOngvar the Hero? Yes, he was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery. I‚Äôll take you there‚Äù\n\nSer Kjoldi led the group to the Icepeaks, a nearby mountain range. Mount Pleasant was almost  a sheer rock face. Luckily, there were stairs carved into the rock. The party began to climb.\n\nJizzard: ‚ÄúYou know, this really isn‚Äôt that pleasant.‚Äù\n\nKjoldi: ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs a bit of a misnomer, really.‚Äù\n\nThe party reached the top of the stairs. Before them stood a large wrought-iron gate. Ser Kjoldi pushed it open and led the party in. Gravestones dedicated to various war heros and other people of significance were \n\nKjoldi: ‚ÄúHere we are, Mount Pleasant Cemetary. Ongvar‚Äôs tomb is over there, between the monuments and trees.‚Äù\n\nThe tomb‚Äôs large stone door was open. The group warily entered, Whisky‚Äôs torch lighting their way. The entrance widened into a larger room that was full of undead townsfolk. The party set to work killing them. After the room was cleared, the party ventured into the next chamber. At the far end, a helmetless Knight of Retribution stood with his back to them.\n\nKjoldi: ‚ÄúBrother! What are you doing in here?‚Äù\n\nThe Knight turned around, revealing that he was also bleeding from his eyes and mouth. The undead Knight screeched and blasted the ceiling with some kind of unholy spell, collapsing the tunnel.\n\nWhisky sighed and examined the room they were trapped in. On one of the walls, a large mural depicted a man in armor slaying a dragon. One area on the wall appeared to be slightly cracked. Whisky heaved his shoulder onto the damaged spot, and it crumbled away before him, revealing a natural rock passageway that wound its way into darkness.\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúSweet. Follow me, everyone.‚Äù\n\nWhisky led the way through the narrow passage until it opened up into a larger cavern.\n\nJizzard: ‚ÄúI really hope there aren‚Äôt spiders in here.‚Äù\n\nMy party knew me too well.\n\nMost of the room was taken up by large spiderwebs. Amanduh tripped over one, sending vibrations up into the darkness above them.\n\nJizzard: ‚ÄúWhy does there always have to be spiders? Why can‚Äôt we have butterflies?‚Äù\n\nWith a creepy hiss, a huge spider descended from the ceiling on a string of web. The party charged into battle, hacking, slashing, and punching at its thick carapace. The Jizzard was blasted with a spray of web from its spinneret, immobilizing him. After more combat, Whisky finished off the beast with a solid punch to the underbelly.\n\nAmanduh: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to cut off its mandibles. I might find a way to use them later.‚Äù\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúI rip off its head and scoop out the insides so I can wear it. The spot where the pincers were could be the eyeholes! Also, I examine the nearby webbing to see if there is anything trapped in there.‚Äù\n\nHe found some old bones that were fused together with webbing in the shape of crude brass knuckles. I called them the Knucklebones. They provided a nice boost to Whisky‚Äôs punching damage.\n\nJizzard: ‚ÄúGuys‚Ä¶ help?‚Äù\n\nAfter they freed the Jizzard from his spidery prison, the party went down a tunnel on the opposite side of the room, which led to another wall. Whisky broke through it, and the group tumbled into the last room of the dungeon: Ongvar‚Äôs final resting place. The stone coffin was broken open, and standing near it were two zombified Knights of Retribution.\n\nKjoldi: ‚ÄúBrothers, no! Fear not, we will release you from this curse!‚Äù\n\nMe: ‚ÄúYou hear moans echoing down the tunnel behind you. Evidently, the zombie townspeople have caught up with you.‚Äù\n\nUlf: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll hold them off! You four, take out those two!‚Äù\n\nUlf took Kjoldi, Eden, and Wolfgang back down the tunnel while the party prepared for battle. The undead Knights were a bit of a challenge, being heavily armored and having the ability to heal each other. Eventually, the party hacked them to bits and checked out what was in the coffin. It was empty, save for the broken hilt of a sword. Lankoris took it as the four NPCs ran back into the room.\n\nUlf: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too many! Help us hold them off here, lads!‚Äù\n\nZombies began shambling into the room, forcing the party to slowly retreat. However, after most of the room was filled with them, they stopped attacking and just stood and eerily stared at the party. A gap formed in their ranks, and out stepped the undead Ongvar. He had somehow gotten his breastplate back, and he looked a bit more‚Ä¶ fleshy than the last time the party had seen him.\n\nOngvar: ‚ÄúI knew I would find you here. You four are really beginning to be more trouble than you‚Äôre worth. However, I understand that you have recently come into possession of an item that my master would very much like to have. I‚Äôll make you a deal: give me the amulet, and you walk out of here with your lives.‚Äù\n\nLankoris: ‚ÄúShit, guys, we don‚Äôt even know what that thing does. We can‚Äôt give it to him; it might be super powerful.‚Äù\n\nAmanduh: ‚ÄúWe have to! There‚Äôs only one way out of here, and it‚Äôs got like a thousand zombies in it!‚Äù\n\nWhisky passed me a slip of paper describing his next actions. Remember that note he found in his pocket earlier? He wanted to cash it in now.\n\nJizzard: ‚ÄúWhy do want it? What does it do?‚Äù\n\nOngvar: ‚ÄúMy reasons are beyon-‚Äù\n\nWhisky deftly pulled a fruit pie out of his backpack, stepped forward, and shoved it into Ongar‚Äôs face.\n\nTime froze, the fruit dripping from Ongvar‚Äôs empty eye sockets suspended in the air. A swirling mass of colored lights appeared, which twirled around each other before coalescing into the form of the Lantern King, who was laughing his ass off.\n\nLantern King: ‚ÄúWell done! You caught him while he was monologuing! I haven‚Äôt seen a prank that good in some time! What do you need?‚Äù\n\nWhisky: ‚ÄúWell, we seem to be in a bit of a tight situation. Could you maybe find a way to get us out of it?‚Äù\n\nThe Lantern King stroked his chin in thought, then snapped his fingers. Then, still chuckling, he vanished into a swirl of multicolored lights.\n\nLankoris: ‚ÄúWhat a nice fellow.‚Äù\n\nTime unfroze, and several loud clangs and thumps came from the passage to the outside. With a roar, Grandmaster Ragnar and several Knights of Retribution broke through the line of zombies. With a swing of his massive warhammer, Ragnar sent Ongvar flying against one of the walls, where he collapsed into a pile of bone, flesh, and metal.\n\nRagnar: ‚ÄúThank Iomedae you‚Äôre alive. Come with us.‚Äù\n\nThe party followed the head of the Order out through the tunnel while the rest of the Knights held off the undead. They exited the tomb, where they found several griffon mounts waiting for them in the graveyard. The Jizzard took a quick glance off the cliff, where he could see more zombies from the town stumbling up the stairs.\n\nRagnar: ‚ÄúGet on! We don‚Äôt have much time!‚Äù\n\nThe party mounted their griffons. As there weren‚Äôt a whole lot of them, everyone had to ride double. The other Knights came out of the tomb dragging the bodies of the undead Knights that  the party had killed. They threw them over the backs of their respective mounts and took off into the sky.",

        "text": "The campaign opens with us all thrown into a training pit on a mystical plane.  A woman appears and tells us that we will have a month the get to know each-other, learn to fight together, and train, so that we might be sent out on a mission for our leaders.  We all take a look around, sizing up our allies.  First, there is me.  I was a Half-Orc-Half-Giant, 8 feet tall and 500 pounds.  An oversized Falchion on my back, and literally nothing but a loincloth for armor.  My new found allies were as follows.  Ember, a Female Half Silver Dragon Human, dressed inconspicuously, wearing a scimitar on his belt, and quite a large set of wings.  Obviously not ready for full on combat (She's a bard, but my character did not know yet).  Tarick, an Aasmir wearing a great-sword on his back, but oddly enough no armor.  Bunny, a masked woman that is so petite she could be broken by a stiff wind (We found out later that her HP is 28 at lvl 12, LOL).\n\nThe mysterious woman holds out an earring, and tells us that it will allow us communication with the higher ups.  I take the earring and pierce my ear with it.  The lady vanishes, leaving us to our own devices.\n\nThe party begins to mingle, learning about each-other, trying to figure out why we were here and what we will be doing.  All the party except me, that is.  When the lady left, I begin to look around.  After a few seconds, I take the earring and yell into it \"Where is my fucking horse?!\".  To which she replies;\n\"He will be waiting for you when you leave, hes being taken care of.\"\n\"I will kill everyone in the room if you do not give me my horse!\" (My character was a simple one.)\n\nAnd in trots a horse large enough to carry my ample frame.  That is to say big.  I mount the beast and begin surveying the area.  Ember eventually calls me over and asks me to tell her about myself.  I reply with less than informative words, and she begins talking to Tarick.  She says, \n\"Well hey, since we're here to train, you two, fight!\"\nI have no problem with this.  Tarick seems down to clown as well.  He begins by casting a protective spell on himself, while I ready my oversized lance, and get some distance.  \n\nInitiative check, I win.  \nFrom 40 feet away, I charge at Tarick.  \nRoll to hit, natural 20.  \nRoll to confirm, confirms.  \n\nCharging while mounted with a lance, along with a mounted combat feat I took, and my strength mod (While raging.  I'm a barbarian, could you guess?) , adds up to (4D8+10)x3.  A critical is (4D8+10)x7.  \n\nThe lance connects dead center, and in the following seconds the cycle of life and death is a bit warped.  Tarick is killed immediatly, having taken a little over 150 damage.  When my lance is just barely leaving his body, a shield of sorts envelops him.  He flies 15 feet back as I peel off to the side, rolling around to look at the damage.  Tarick lands, now alive, and insanely disturbed by what just happened, and not sure how to feel about the half a second of immense pain he just endured.  \n\nWe here the ladies voice say \"Well of course we're not going to let you kill eachother here.\"\n\nI roll around, facing Tarick again.  \n\nEmber says to Bunny, with a sharp breath and a quick and false grin, \"Well!  I guess we all know why he's here.\"\n\nTL;DR - I oneshotted a party member within the first ten minutes of a new campaign.",

        "text": "I was only recently (3 years, now,) introduced to D&amp;D. I'd barely even heard of it, but my then-boyfriend wanted to play, and they needed one more to make an even four players.\n\nAs the \"Virgin\" of the group, I was given to my friend T, who has played since the game came out. Between him and another player, I swear our group had every book ever written for the game. He asked me what I was interested in playing, and in the spirit of the old D&amp;D cdroms, I chose a cleric. The group needed a healer, so everyone agreed it was a great plan. \n\nNow, remember those billions of books I mentioned? I was told to find my race and information in this plethora of books, and I only had our first session to do so... Luckily, T had my back! \n\n\"Tell the DM you wanna play a Kender!\" \n\nI was confused... that race wasn't in the PHB 3.5 that I had seen, but I went and told the DM. \"You... a... Kender? Well... sure.\" \n\nWith this great news, I returned to my adviser, intent on seeking more information. That was when he laid it down on me.\n\nFor anyone who isn't familiar with the Kender, allow me to explain: a Kender is a breed of Halfling. Some call them kleptomaniacial team killers, but the way I read the info, they more... don't understand the concept of ownership. Or danger... or personal boundaries... or common courtesy... Pretty much, if they see something they like, they take it. They will also give things away without a qualm because they also don't understand monetary/personal value of objects. But enough of the lore, I think you get the point.\n\nI looked through the list of deities in the PHB, and found one I liked, that seemed to fit the general \"theme\" of my Cleric. Fharlanghn! God of travel, roads, and etc! Perfect. Now I had my reason to be out and about, where I would find the party! \n\nThe next week couldn't arrive fast enough. I wanted to play my character! \n\nWhen it finally rolled around, everyone decided (before I arrived,) that I was going to go \"first\" to open up the roleplay. So I did (I think they were hoping I would fail miserably, the drunken bastards.)\n\nLet me introduce the party right quick. There was me, the lovable cleric, the idiot Human Paladin, T, the Human Druid, the Gnomish Ranger, and my then-beau, the half-orc Rogue. \n\nFor the sake of telling OOC from IC, IC will be in italics.\n\n*Ayl, well into her cups, ignored the door banging open, intent on just oooone more drink, much to the barkeeps dismay. \"We're looking for this woman!\" an imperious voice barked out behind her.* \n\nIn the interest of the other characters PoV: the Paladin was looking for his missing sister. While hunting for her, he found a Druid and Ranger without a forest to tend. He didn't know it, but his sister had burned their woods to the ground, and they were intent on revenge. The rogue, of course, was the previous owner of the stolen ring. \n\n*\"Well, that's the Lord's bride, so it is!\" a voice said in surprise. When the group demanded to know her whereabouts, the man who recognized her sent them to Ayl (sarden barkeep, distracting the Halfling from the love of her life.)*\n\nOnce it was established that the picture was indeed the Lord's bride, the group wanted to charge off after her. *\"Ha, tradition! Wife is all locked up until the ceremony, but without the ring, she can't get married!\" With a description of the ring, the party‚Äôs mission became clear. Reclaim the ring to lure out the bride.*\n\nAfter a raucous barfight begun over \"the cost of the little ladies drinks,\" the group, now including Ayl, was chased out of town. Much to the Ranger's dismay, she decided to accompany them on their journey. And so they were off!\n\nBeing adventurers, we had our fair share of small combat. Before we found our next lead, we had hit level two. Shortly after, we found traces of our thief and chased him into a dismal patch of desert. There we had our first distraction, which included a magic sponge, a critical fail, and a **very** angry Ogre. \n\nAnother interesting occurrence was the appearance of the Magic Yak. Yes, literally a yak. He showed up one night and gave our party gifts. I got a shiny rock (ooooh, shiny,) the rogue and Paladin each a mug of never ending alcohol, the druid a box with magic compartments that he could refold to fit anything of any size, and the Ranger got a ring... his precioussss.\n\nIn surprisingly fast time, we cornered the ring thief in a dungeon. Intent on skinning him alive for all the trouble, our ranger charged down, and being good fellows, we followed... only to lose his trail because our Rogue was completely inept. \n\nAfter several days of wandering, lost in the seemingly endless dungeon, we ran out of water. \n\n*\"I'm thirstyyyyy!\" whined Ayl, digging through her companions bags on the hunt for the alcohol mugs. She didn't find anything to drink, but she /did/ find a painting in the ranger's bag... which she kept, leaving her shiny rock in its place.*\n\nThe ranger was **furious.** He wanted to kill me/her on the spot, but cool heads (the Paladin,) intervened, informing him that the evil act of killing me would make them enemies. How did I repay the Paladin? I took the food out of his bag, ate what I wanted, lost the rest, and refilled it with shiny rocks of varying weights. \n\nThat same day, we found a room with a shelf that was covered in glassware. Some was broken, others whole. Three contained a pale red liquid. I drank all three before the party could stop me. \n\nDM to me OOC: \"That could be poison, you know.\"\nMe to DM: \"I guess I'll find out soon enough!\"\n\nWhen the cleric didn't keel over, the party continued on, until they found a nice quiet room with one small entrance to camp out in for the night. I drew first watch. \n\n\"I watch the entrance determinedly for about an hour!\" I proclaimed grandly. Then the DM slipped me the note... *\"You notice through the door, a slight glimmer...\"* \n\nSo of course I went to investigate. The rest of the party was asleep by this point, not that I was bothering to sneak. And what do I find, sparkling in the pale green luminescence? A gold coin. Then another... then another... a trail of golden coins, leading away. \n\nI followed them along the floor, until I found the source. A room the group had missed, coins and gems scattered across the floor. With a happy yip, I went after them.\n\nAt this point, the Paladin rolled a high enough perception to wake up and come searching for me... only to find me crawling on the floor, skeletons waving swords stiffly climbing from coffins. His shout woke the party, who came running... \n\nAll the while I had my dear little cleric picking up shinies off the floor, completely ignoring their pleas to heal them. Once they defeated the large spooky guy casting spells that a particularly clumsy cleric awoke, they dragged me back to the camp. I happily doled out my shinies, not even noticing the air of barely suppressed rage.\n\nThe Ranger took the next watch. Then the DM asked me to roll perception. I failed, of course. The next morning, the party was shocked to find the poor little hafling dead, her throat slit from ear to ear. She hadn't even woken up. \n\nThe Paladin, being a \"good guy,\" carried the body out of the dungeon, which they finally escaped thanks to my finding the skeleton room. Then he buried me, with his mug of never ending alcohol, of which I was most fond. He left it face down, to forever sate my thirst in death. \n\nThen the party moved on. I rolled a new character, and we continued on our adventures. Once we neared the end of the campaign, we began to hear the rumors... \n\nRumors of the Lich that haunted the Marsh of Mead. It turned out those drinks were Vamp pots, and now being undead, my poor little cleric went a little‚Ä¶ crazy. The upended mug of alcohol continued to pour, creating a swamp consisting of mixed alcohols. The last game I played with them, they mentioned her again. We went ahead and added it to our maps as a permanent homebrew add-in. \n",

        "text": "So, one of my friends got Shadowrun 5E a few weeks ago, and he invited me and several others to play. We had a sort of odd party (none of us really know the rules too well) of an alcoholic dwarf (Titus) who was really only good as a sniper and a driver, a troll brawler adept (Yama), an ex-military weapons specialist (Norse), the GMPC who was an elvish gunslinger adept (Kato), and myself, a sort of \"classy\" UGB assassin with a bunch of fake SINs.\n\nWe start in a dive bar, getting smashed after a successful run, and we se several odd looking fellows walk into a back room. The bartender talks to us and says he has no idea who those fuckers are, and he'll pay us a few nuyen to check it out, so we do. First, Kato tries to pick the lock with an autopick or something, which glitches. Then, Yama tries to kick in the door. This doesn't work. Finally, norse shoots the lock off as Kato tosses in a flashbang, which stuns the entire group inside. We, through a combination of intimidation, negotiation, and some carefully used nonlethal strikes, gather that they're agents of the Ares corporation who are scouting out a nearby building that belongs to Aztechnology. They got a 150 million nuyen budget, and blew almost all of it, getting very little info on the building. The building is a research lab that contains some experimental biotech and weaponry, and they need to steal the data concerning it, as well as development info. Through some lucky rolls, we end up contracting with Ares to steal the data, undercutting the remaining budget by a substantial amount. \n\nFlash-forward a bit: I've gathered some info from my UGB contact about the building itself and its security, and we figure one way to get in would be to capture a guard, take his information, and make our way into the building with that. Here's where the funny shit happens. So, my dice-pool for disguise is 8. The way we lure a guard away from the building is that I dress up as a woman and take him into a back alley, where Norse stuns him and then we pump him for info. I roll 7 hits on disguise, higher than my social limit, so I have a VERY convincing disguise as a woman. I lure him into a back alley, and we stun his ass, get the security info to get into the building, and then take some \"incriminating\" pictures to use as collateral. After that's done, Norse stuns him again, we dump a bottle of vodka out onto him, drive him fifteen miles away, dump his unconscious ass out, and make our way back to the building. \n\nThat's all we got done today, and we're continuing this shit on Monday. Until next time, r/gametales. ",

        "text": "I've been wanting to get into tabletop RPG's for a while. I finally find a group (off reddit), and tell them I'm interested in DM'ing. I get the core rulebook, read through it, and get the 2014 free RPG day module (raiding a pyramid).\n\nTwo other people end up showing for the game. We say fuck it, and get started.\n\nIt's a level 3 module, but they decide to go the hard route and roll lvl 1s. I figure I'll just toss in some easy monsters to kill in the town the characters are meeting in. Oh, and I also roll a lvl 3 half-orc rogue (Ulf) which I intend to have them befriend and come along on their journey.\n\nHere's the story:\n\nMaloch (gnome wizard) and Twitch (elf rogue) already know each other and walk in to the village of Osirion. It's the closest inhabited place to a newly uncovered ancient pyramid.\n\nAs a newbie DM, I forgot about the town and had set up everything for the pyramid, so I quickly cobble together Osirion.\n\nThere are 2 shops, a temple, some houses, and the tavern/inn, population: 50.\n\nThey check out the shops, not getting anything, then head into the temple. Here they try to get the adept priestess to come along with them, but fail. After a nat 20 bluff roll, they've convinced the adept that they are on the temple god's mission to go plunder the temple and return holy relics. The priestess gives them a spyglass to help.\n\nNext stop: tavern. They walk in the front door, ask for chicken pot pie, and ale. They immediately notice a half-orc(Ulf) among the 7 other humans, so they figure something is up.\n\nOn paying for his food, Maloch notices his torch is missing from his bag. Treachery!\n\nThey decide not to do anything immediately, since it could have happened elsewhere.\n\nThey just eat and keep their ears pealed, focusing especially on the half-orc.\n\nThey eventually overhear Ulf talking about the pyramid, and figure he's after the loot and must have some good gear.\n\nTwitch, \"Let's sneak into his room and steal everything tonight.\"\n\nTrouble is, they don't know which room is his. Not even thinking to bribe the innkeep, they decide to accidentally spill some cologne that Twitch had and then find his room by smell.\n\nFor some reason, they decided that the 2.5 ft tall gnome is the best one to spill perfume on the 7 ft half-orc.\n\nUlf is understandably pissed, picks Malock up by the head and tells him to empty his pockets as payment.\n\nMalock thinks this is a good time to try to convince Ulf to come with them to the pyramid. Rolled 10 in diplomacy.\n\nWhen that fails, Malock seizes the opportunity to throw a vial of acid he has on Ulf's face.\n\nTwitch jumps up into the rafters. His character is kind of like the Asian guy who fits in a box in Oceans 11.\n\nDirect hit, that means it splashes on Malock too, bringing him from 7 to 2 HP.\n\nUlf is furious, and caries Malock up to his room, where his recently rabid dog is hanging out. Ulf tosses Malock in there.\n\nTwitch goes to jump across the rafters to get to the room to help Malock and rolls a 12. I decide he'll slip and be dangling. He somehow rolls a 19 on a hide (don't remember actually name) check and so no one see's him.\n\nHe gets up to the room, just as Malock has turned the dog into a pile of acid goop, with only the head and hindquarters left.\n\nNow they're both in a room with Ulf's acidified pet.\n\nHere Twitch comes up with something genius: He takes a needle, pushes it into the door, bends it into a hook, and hangs a bell from it. This way they can be cleaning up the dog and still notice if the door opens.\n\nThey decide to toss the dog bits into the bed, write \"DED DOG\" on the wall, and use soap and water to make the area in front of the door really slippery. The idea is that Ulf will come up, be incensed by DED DOG and run to maim Malock, but slip on the soap. This is when Malock on Twitch will jump him.\n\nTo make a loud noise, Malock smashes the window.\n\nThey hear footsteps, and watch the door open to the angry face of the innkeep, who of course slips and falls, knocking himself out. \n\nThey close the door, trying to figure out what to do.\n\nThere's soon another person running up the stairs. Turns out it's the innkeep's daughter, also slipping and getting knocked out.\n\nTwitch and Malock are panicking hard as the other 6 people in the inn rush up. They're brandishing knives and have murder in their eyes.\n\nTwitch jumps out of the window and hides on a nearby roof. It's nighttime.\n\nMalock *somehow* convinces them that it was Ulf who did it all, and that he'll clean up the mess, as soon as he gets back from going to get his friend (Twitch).\n\nTurns out Ulf had left to go to the pyramid right after throwing Malock in his room.\n\nHoly shit, that ended up long!! Anyway, it was a really fun time, and I thought some people might like to hear about it :)\n\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2dwi3y/dd_35_taking_down_the_herald_of_a_demon_lord/",
        "text": "First off, I apologize for any spelling or grammar errors, I'm typing this on my phone (it is a crazy slow day at work, lol)\n\nWithin the last year or so, I began playing with a new group that a buddy from my main game group invited me to. He had told me all sorts of stories of the wacky (and often marginally chaotic evil) acts the group pulled off, so I was excited to play. This story pretty much sums up how we resolve situations. \n\nI joined the game during one of the players character plot line. We were supposed to be going to her secret city to help defend it from fire giants. As we were preparing for our journey, though, one of the players realized he still had a Deck of Many Things (aka, the campaign wrecker). We all decided to draw from it. One of the characters drew a card that ended up getting him captured by Orcus (Demon Lord of the Undead). So the rest of the party ended up having to go through a long trek through hell (literally) to rescue him. \n\nAfter we finally rescue him and escape, we plane shift out onto an island, which is plagued by a mature adult black dragon (who is also a cleric of another demon lord, don't remember which one). We defeat the dragon, and go looking for his treasure hoard. After fighting several minor guardians (and a couple demons from summoning traps), we clear the lair, and find a temple and altar to the dragon's demon master. Our wizard (the one who got trapped in hell), who now absolutely despises demons, so he decides to first smash the altar to pieces, then proceeds to urinate all over the smashed altar. \n\nThat was too much for our gm (and the demon) to let slide. The demon sends it's Herald down to fight us. It's Herald was some sort of half-fiendish black pudding. For those who don't know, black puddings (and most other oozes) suck royally, due to the fact that they are acidic, and when struck in melee, they splash acid on the attacker, and stand a very good chance of destroying your weapon. \n\nThis creature was CR18. Our average party level at the time was roughly 12. We all knew we were screwed, but we refused to back down. Death before dishonor, right? Also.... The dragon hoard!  So we fought. Given the fact that all our heavy hitters were melee focused, and none of us were willing to risk melee combat, we were nickel and diming him down. All things considered, we did pretty well. Then our spell casters started running low on spells. Our Druid cast acid resistance on himself, wild shaped, and engages it in melee. He was doing ok... But then it grappled him and dealt him a butt load of damage.  It became swiftly apparent that he would need a critical success to break free... And if the creature kept dealing damage like that, he had 2 rounds, tops. Since he was also kinda the party healer... That would also mean we were screwed. \n\nAt this point, I went out for a smoke break (this fight had been going for near 2 hours of real time, by this point), and I started reviewing my character sheet to see if there was anything else I could do that would help. It was then that I found it, an ability I had never used... I was playing a custom prestige class my gm designed for my character called a Doombringer of Hoar (Forgotten Realms god of poetic justice). This ability allowed me to force an enemy that had struck me, an ally, or an innocent to treat it's next roll as a natural 1 (an automatic failure on everything except skill checks). Even better, it got no save. The catch was, I could only do that once a day, so it had to count. \n\nI went back upstairs, and conferred with our wizard. Since we went simultaneously, I cast that ability on it. The wizard followed up with charm monster (convinces the monster that the caster is it's ally). It had to auto fail it's save, it is now convinced that the wizard is it's best friend in the world. He then feeds it this story about him being a servant of the same demon. He tells it that we are too powerful for it, but he can cast something on it to make it unbeatable. GM has him do an opposed diplomacy check. He rolls a nat 20. Based on the GM's reaction, he rolled a nat 1. \n\nCreature agrees to allow a spell cast on it. The wizard casts polymorph, and turns this CR 18, fiendish black pudding Herald of a demon lord into a tiny mouse. He then takes and empty potion bottle and starts pissing in it. After filling it 3/4 of the way, he drops in the former herald, and seals it in. \n\nSo that is the story of how we drowned the Herald of a demon lord in a jar of piss. ",

        "text": "**Part 1, Wherein a Knight Errant officer has a shitty day**\n\nHotentote and Elliot are off doing stupid meat world things, so it‚Äôs just me and Crumbles today.  Our GM offered us a couple of choices, and instead of missing a week or delaying for three to four hours, we took the opportunity to run some sidequests.  \n\nThe GM opened us with the traditional phone call.  Crumbles has a job offer from one of our previous contacts, its ‚ÄúSmall game, really.  Should be a milk run.‚Äù\n\nOut of character, I have to admit to a surge of terror when I heard those words.  Crumbles laughed at my discomfort and we went to meet our new Mr. Johnson.  The meet was in a dive bar, a comfortable and familiar locale indeed.  The bar itself was nearly empty, and I figure the colossally fat troll in the corner isn‚Äôt our contact.  Crumbles approaches the worn down businessman at the bar, and we‚Äôre on. \n\nTonight‚Äôs mission is simple indeed, we‚Äôre to steal a van that takes a predictable route - and even better, Crumbles drops a landslide of boxcars on a Matrix search and finds the route of the van!  \n\nThe driver stops for gas at the same place every time.  Mr. Johnson is closed-mouth about the contents of the van, but it can‚Äôt be big or important.  Not with this poor behavior on the part of the driver. \n\nSo we go.  Show up well early at the gas station, and we‚Äôre doing our best Jay and Silent Bob imitations.  The gas station itself is nothing special, smokes and beers and snacks, a bored cashier behind three inch bulletproof glass.  There‚Äôs a drug dealer setup on the other end of the sidewalk in front of the building, and Crumbles tries vainly to get some sugar out of him.  \n\nOn his empty-handed way back to my slouched position, Crumbles perks up.  There‚Äôs a ganger storming up to us, and he looks pissed.  Fortunately he‚Äôs so entry level that he‚Äôs got a bloody nailboard. \n\nThe kid walks up to me and pokes me in the chest, wants to know where I get off coming into his territory.  I take his board away, break it in half, and hand him the part with the nails in it.  Crumbles explains to him that he needs to go away before he comes down with a bad case of facial fistules. \n\nThe little punk takes off, and Crumbles goes into the gas station in search of snacks.  I yell after him to get me some jerky.  Pissy about the lack of sugar and the intrusive ganger, Crumbles brings back a bag that expired two years ago.\n\nFuck it, down the hatch.  ‚Äòs good, too. \n\nThe van‚Äôs pulling into the gas station, so it‚Äôs go time.  Crumbles is nearly vibrating out of his shoes because the ganger‚Äôs back, also.  I don‚Äôt care about little punks, I‚Äôve got a job to do.  The van parks at the gas pump and the driver starts fuelling the vehicle.  Crumbles is about to jump the gun and blow the whole plan.  \n\nI ‚Äòcalm‚Äô him.  A troll squeeze on the shoulder directs his attention to me, long enough for the driver to put the fuel nozzle back on the pump and mosey into the gas station.  I release Crumbles and he almost sprints to the van.  I slouch more comfortably against the wall and accidentally move towards the door.  The gangers are close, and the driver is on his way out, a six pack of beer tucked under his arm as he lights a smoke.  Crumbles can‚Äôt get the van started, so plan b.\n\nMy shock glove is very used, so it doesn‚Äôt go off completely.  Also I may have almost missed.  I still manage to knock the dude over, and the troll fist sends him into lala land.  I rifle through his pockets real quick and take his beer and his smokes.\n\nOh, and the van key.  Board boy tries to stop me and I toss him at his buddies on my way to the van. \n\nWhy am I rolling body + end?  \n\nI‚Äôm stricken by rumblygut and death ass.  I clench and grunt and throw the keys to Crumbles.  We pile in the van and take off, small arms fire pinging off the body panels or punching through as we leave.  None hit us, so off we go!  Crumbles can‚Äôt map, nor can I, so he punches the coordinates for the drop in and turns loose the van in autodrive.  I sweat profusely and squeeze my butt cheeks together. \n\nThe blue and red lights behind us are not a welcome sight.  The Knight Errant cop commands us to pull over, and Crumbles starts to panic. \n\n‚ÄúPull the van over!‚Äù  the cop demands. \n\n‚ÄúPull the van over!‚Äù I tell Crumbles. \n\nHe pulls the van over and I throw the door open.  I lean in, and tell Crumbles to DRIVE.  The van pulls away and I storm towards the cop car.  The cop tases me over his driver‚Äôs door, and I shrug the darts aside.  Proper Preperation, kids!\n\nI clamber up on the hood of the car, flip my coat up, drop trou and unleash hell on the cop.  He collapses to the ground in a puddle of troll shit and vomit, and I pull a fade. \n\nI stumble back to our ride and have it take me back to my doss.  The rest of the evening is spent in a particular kind of hell, only interrupted by Crumples transferring my half of the evening‚Äôs take into my account. \n\nI text the little bastard and tell him to pick me up some pepto. \n\n**Part II - The Pay Troll goes to school.**\n\nThe pepto has knocked my stomach back into working order, but I‚Äôve got pink spots.  Crumbles takes me to his doc, who tells me I‚Äôm allergic to bismuth subsalicylate.  I have no idea what that is, but the spots are spreading.  Supposedly this will clear on its own, so I plan on just spending the next few days hiding under the bed. \n\nThat plan goes awry when we get a comm from our new Mr. Johnson on the way back from the doc.  Against my better judgement and expressed wishes, we went back to the bar.  Mr. Johnson declined to discuss my current pigment problems.  The pink had spread from spots to splotches, big ones.  Mr. Johnson had another job for us, this one had an odd set of challenges.  \n\nWe needed to protect a schoolgirl.  During a school day.  In a school. \n\nWell, hell.  At least the job was tomorrow.  I wasn‚Äôt dressed for this.  We went shopping, and when I was trying on a fuzzy sweatervest in safety orange I realized I was now completely pink.\n\nOh boy.\n\nThe next day saw me making my way into a public school, dressed in skintight blue jeans and that horrible safety orange sweatervest.  And completely pink. \n\nI almost made it through the entrance with my shock gloves and brass knuckles.  Almost.  A demon from the nether realm appeared in the form of the assistant principal, a wizened orc female who couldn‚Äôt be bargained with or worked around. \n\nShe took my shock gloves and my knucks and sent me on my way with my ears pinned back and my tail between my legs.  I managed to find the VIP, thankfully.  Mocking laughter trailed after me as I ducked into a restroom near the target‚Äôs class.  I managed to hide there for the entire period. \n\nI lunged into the hall as the period ended, and got back on the girl‚Äôs trail.  I made it into the same classroom as her this time, and suffered through the most boring history lesson ever.  The glances and laughter were starting to get to me, but I couldn‚Äôt just start smacking schoolkids together.  \n\nWe‚Äôre gonna switch back over to Crumbles.  While I went into the school, he had staked out a Soybucks nearby, and was busily spending nuyen on coffee.  He‚Äôd racked up over one hundred credits on black coffee with cinnamon and creamer, and was currently capable of vibrating his way through glass.\n\nHistory was over, thankfully.  The girl‚Äôs next class was chemistry, and I made it to that one too.  I was hoping to actually learn something here - chemistry is how you make bombs, right? \n\nNot so much.  The teacher droned on about acids and bases like a tape loop, and the girl was busily typing away on her commlink.  Many of the kids kept sneaking glances at me and giggling.  One rat was flat out staring.  I gave him a growl and he looked away. \n\nThe class ended, thankfully.  I hustled out of the classroom and was trying to follow the girl as she escaped this hell hole, but the Demon Princess blocked my path.  I tried begging.  I tried negotiating.  I even tried to intimidate her.\n\nNothing worked.  She demanded that I leave the school, which considering the rapid exit of my VIP, actually sounded like a good idea.  I took my orange sweatervest and the shreds of my dignity, and exited stage fuck this.\n\nI commed Crumbles as soon as I hit the bricks.  He was barely intelligible, shaking so hard the image on the link was a fuzzy blur.  I saw him come hurtling out of the Soybucks and onto his bike, and I shook my head as I got on the bus.\n\nThe bus trip was almost as bad as sitting in school.  Some folks actually pointed and laughed.  \n\nThe bus dropped me off at a mall.  I moseyed my miserable way to another Soybucks and joined up with Crumples.  He was valiantly trying to order another XXL quad shot espresso with the jittering flappers that had replaced his lips.  His comm chirped, interrupting him, and we were paid for a timed period of rugrat guarding. \n\nThank god.  I ushered Crumples back to his bike and set the wee thing to take him home.  I climbed onto the bus and made my way back to my doss.\n\n\n**Part III - The hangover is the best part. **\n\nCrumbles felt like crap the next day.  I wasn‚Äôt doing too hot myself, and I was still pink.  I had Crumples pick me up in the Ameracar and take me back to the doc.  This time I managed to hold the damn doc down until he explained what was going on in simple terms.  The pepto had gone to my hide, and I would be pink for another three days at a minimum. \n\nLovely. \n\nCrumbles was on the comm with Mr. Johnson‚Ä¶  he had another little job for us. \n\nGrand.  I piled into the car and we headed for the bar.  I was getting tired, these little jobs were starting to seriously harsh my mellow.  And I was still pink.\n\nMr. Johnson wanted us to‚Ä¶  Take a fall against a teen razorboy in a mask.  We were to start a fight by harassing the same girl we were bodyguarding yesterday, this little hero was going to confront us, and we were going to lose. \n\nWhat the hell.  I raised a meaty paw to pound the bar and say ‚Äòno‚Äô in as emphatic a manner as I possibly could.  Mr. Johnson beat me to it, though.  This ‚Äúkiddy shit‚Äù couldn‚Äôt be right, he said.  He flailed, he bitched, he got very calm.\n\n‚ÄúBring that little fucker to me.  I will have an explanation.‚Äù\n\nNow this, this I could get behind.  \n\nWe spent a few moments putting our gear back together and doing some maintenance.  I was able to track down replacement brass knuckles and stun gloves, and they made the choicest of fashion accesories to my slacks, shirt, tie, and coat. \n\nNote to self.  Burn that orange horror.\n\nThe job took us back to the mall.  The girl was there, just like yesterday.  Just like tomorrow and tomorrow, until she grew up into a little corpslave.  Today should prove a little different for her.  Crumbles was ready, so I opened by knocking her noodles into her lap.  Hot broth and spilled food.  She started making noise, so I knocked her over.\n\nThe little fucker made himself known by standing up and posturing.  ‚ÄúHey you! Get away from her!‚Äù\n\nYeah, that wasn‚Äôt going to happen.  I wasn‚Äôt gonna back down from some fifteen year old kid in a hockey mask.  I posed in return, stretching my chest out and standing tall.  ‚ÄúCome at me, then.‚Äù\n\nHe did.  I let him take a few swings and bruise his hands on my body armor, then laid him out with the old reliable Fist of the Angry Troll technique. \n\nI pluck the kid up and Crumbles soothes the girl‚Äôs hurt feelings with a hundered nuyen and an apology, and we‚Äôre off.\n\nAs soon as we deal with the mallcops that want to know what the hell we‚Äôre doing.  I‚Äôve got funboy tucked under one arm, and he‚Äôs starting to flail and make irritating noises.  A quick application of the shock glove to his bum, and he‚Äôs quiet. \n\nCrumbles ran over my perfectly good explanation of how our diabetic friend needed to be taken home insulin needles yes with some long winded spiel about his retard brothers‚Ä¶\n\nhmph.\n\nWe got out of the mall and bundled the little shit into the car.  I made a very important stop on the way to Mr. Johnson‚Äôs dropoff point.  So it was to a very pissed off Mr. Johnson standing next to a pink troll with a roaring monofilament chainsaw that this poor bastard awoke. \n\nThat couldn‚Äôt have been fun.  I shut down the saw and Mr. Johnson pulled off the kid‚Äôs mask.  ‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK!‚Äù\n\nThe kid was his son.  The girl was some skirt he‚Äôd been chasing.  And he‚Äôd been loading his father‚Äôs commlink with jobs to try and romance her. \n\nBrilliant.  I hate kids.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2dp7a9/cyberpunk_2020_phoenix_rising_or_how_a_series_of/",
        "text": "I've been debating on and off about putting this up here, but I feel like the time is right. \n\nI don't think too many people here have played Cyberpunk 2020, but it was the second RPG I was introduced to by my uncle, and by far my favorite to play. It's pretty brutal, not a single game I've played or reffed (the GM is call a referee) ever ended in finishing a campaign, and often the time it took to make characters took longer than the duration of a game.\n\nSo here's the background: The ref is my uncle, the one who showed me Cyberpunk, and the players are my brother, my cousin, and me. My uncle's really good at writing campaigns, and we were planning on playing a game. It's Christmas break, so everyone's together, and there's enough people there to play. He goes off most of the day to write out the whole story (it can get pretty elaborate, and it's always good: full of puzzles, fights, and memorable NPCs.) After he's ready, he calls us out one by one to ask us what archetype we'd like to follow - a new technique, he usually doesn't do it, but the story was very specific and so were the backstories to the different archetypes. I forget the ones we didn't pick, but my brother chose a Talker, my cousin a Fixer, and I chose a Specialist. My brother specs heavily into Fast Talking and Handguns, my cousin goes into Gambling, Seduction, and other illicit skills, and I go all out in Electronic security and Chemistry (the skill list for Cyberpunk is half the character sheet, aka a lot.) Now, we're playing an urban game, so we weren't allowed any heavy demolitions like Cyberpunk's C6, which we lovingly define as \"2 explosions better than C4,\" and that's why I specced into Chem. You'll see in a minute if you don't already. My handle was Strongfish (S), my cousin was Lhoh Righder (LR), and my Brother we referred to as \"H.\" He forgot to put a name.\n\nNow the backstories we were given were very important to what happens next, so here they are:\n\nStrongfish: Had an old lover in the corporate lab he used to work for, she was killed by a thug named Olive in a gang named \"the Bakshis.\" Went a little haywire after that and dropped his job.\n\nH: did a stint in jail, made friends with a couple guys, among them, Buddy, the leader of the Bakshis.\n\nLogh: Heavy Gambler, has an off-and-on relationship with a fellow gambler, Fran.\n\nSo we start out with the hook of a bar that is owned by H's contact, Vixen. However, we all decide that we only loosely know each through the odd job or ten, and we all start in different places. Now, in making our characters, we forgot to buy both phones to talk to each other and apartments to crash in if need be. Our uncle lets us have the phones, but says no to the apartments. So we end up being murderhobos, for real.\n\nIn light of this, the first thing S does is drag a cardboard box around the back of a supermarket, walk inside and buy the following items: 100% isopropyl alcohol, ammonia based cleaner, bleach, a bucket with an airtight top, tubing, 2 hip flasks and 2 six packs of beer. He then walks around the back, drinks a couple beers for bravery and begins to cook in his cardboard laboratory. Now, while we weren't allowed high end explosives which was the basis for my initial specialist, he didn't say anything about home-brews, and I was so precise in the note I passed to him about it he let me do it. It helped when I rolled a crit on my own initiative (ha) before handing over the note, but he said I didn't need the roll.  Now while I was doing that, H is in the bar, and gets tasked with a simple delivery run, when two Sudanese Nationals pop in with AK's and try to light up the place. H, being skilled in quickdraw and having six pistols strapped pirate-like to his chest, proceed to kill both before they even squeeze a trigger. However, he turned around so fast he didn't notice the bulletproof glass that dropped on the booth Vixen was sitting in, that he was standing in front of. He then high tails it out of there. Meanwhile, Logh's puttering around, which we later find out involves texting Fran. Right before we all call to meet up, Strongfish has gone back in the store for a car battery, jumper cables, a 5-gallon jug full of water, and finally possesses 4 bottles of concentrated Hydrochloric acid, 4 bottles of pure alcohol with rags, 2 flasks of chlorine gas, and 4 bottles of hydrogen gas. A walking weapon of mass destruction, or about 3 sticks of C6. Yeah, only 3. With 8d10AP damage with compounded AOE in a game where 8 points of damage to a limb means you lose it, C6 is the *good shit.* Anyways, we all meet up, H tells us the job, simple delivery: except for the fact that we have to steal what we deliver. Fortunately, the guy we need to steal it from is a regular at the Cinerama, the place where Logh is too. What we were gonna do was pull a con. We were gonna have Logh befriend the guy at the tables. Strongfish would come in, drop his flasks of chlorine and clear the place out. Logh would take the mark out through the back where H would track them to a certain point, then the two would jump the guy and make with the package. Piece of cake, right? Well, remember when I said we forgot to buy phones and apartments? We also forgot transportation. Rather than hiring a taxi, Logh decides to pick pocket a guy for his keys and get us a ride. He rolls a crit. Crit fail, that is. Now, in cyberpunk, there is a device called a det-card, or detonation card. If say, your wallet gets stolen, the det-card can only be removed so far from your body, whereupon another card that emits a signal to the det-card, tells it to... detonate. So when Logh stands there successfully holding the keys, the guy he picked starts running away. *Fast.* Our cousin hadn't known about det-cards from any previous game we played (He had only played Cyberpunk twice before,) and so OOC and IC my brother and I were yelling at him to toss the keys. He does, and throws it all the way across the street, where they then explode. We scram. An explosion on a busy street is sure to put cops on the scene, and either the pickpocket who caused it or the guy who's got explosives in his coat like a domestic terrorist are gonna get called for it, leaving the car battery and jumper cables behind, which could have been useful at a later date for... inquiries. A short run later, S runs into a multilevel parking lot and tries to pick the lock on a different car. Crit fail. With a car alarm blaring a few blocks from where the cops would be, everyone ends up taking cabs from three different places.\n\nSo these cabs all head towards Cinerama, which is a casino built inside an abandoned cinema. Across the street, Strongfish notices a couple gangers, one of which messing with a girl. Upon a closer Awareness check, S notices the ganger is one known for getting his jollies on hitting women, and gets out of the taxi and charges, shouting \"Hey Olive, remember me?\" The other two taxis stop, and Logh and H get out to cover S, who's basically running into trouble. This is when Logh recognizes the girl getting roughed up - Fran. He don't take kindly to that either so he starts charging. Now, Logh was closer, so he got there first, and tackles Olive, freeing Fran. Now this caused some concern for Strongfish, who is still running full tilt. Fortunately, the distance is just far enough for Logh to roll out before S drops the hammer on both of them. Meanwhile, the other gang members are too shocked to do anything but start to reach. But H is already there, guns out. He sees Buddy sitting on the stoop, points a gun at him and says, \"Tell your men to come off, let it slide for your friend's friend.\" \n\nStrongfish, half-mad and covered in chemicals, keeps Olive pinned to the ground with some successful dice-rolling. He says, \"Hitting girls must be thirsty work, huh *Olive*? You sure look thirsty, ***Olive***!\" \n\nNow, if you thought this was a little out of hand, it gets *way worse.* Cyberpunk is a pretty brutal world, and with my character's backstory I was in the mood for pretty brutal RPing. While Logh is grabbing Fran, Strongfish unbottles a little HCl for the man who killed his love, *and pours it on his face.* \n\nAll hell breaks loose.\n\nAfter seeing such a horrific scene, everyone has to take a stun save. While Olive's screaming and clawing at his face on the ground, Strongfish has got his boot on Olive's chest and is laughing *maniacally,* Logh's covering Fran's eyes, Buddy and his gang start to reach in their pockets, one of them doubled over and vomiting, and H pops Buddy right in the chest. Buddy goes down, H barks at Logh to ditch, Logh books it behind a large dumpster down the block with Fran in tow, and Strongfish is still standing on Olive, pulling out his pistol. Strongfish and H take out two other gangers before they can pull out the SMGs, but the last guy pulls out a grenade and tosses it. Bad idea.\n\nThe street goes up in flames. With 48 oz of Hydrogen gas, 48 of pure alcohol, and two flasks of chlorine gas, it was huge. It pushes the dumpster a good 3 meters, and through ref caveat I suppose, Fran and Logh survive. H, Strongfish, and the Bakshi's? Up in flames like a rising phoenix.\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2dlgni/numenera_session_14_and_now_for_something/",
        "text": "Previous Session Here: http://www.reddit.com/r/numenera/comments/2cy2sl/numenera_session_13_how_to_train_your_raster/\n***\nThe group has just finished fighting the strange probe they found near the woodcutter‚Äôs camp. But I knew we‚Äôd be missing our learned nano, so I didn‚Äôt want to drive further into the story without him. So I tried something different, breaking out the game The Quiet Year. If you haven‚Äôt heard of it, it‚Äôs basically a community/map building game set over one year, using a deck of cards. It‚Äôs fantastic. So we played through the game and I will use it in the Numenera campaign in the future. I will attempt to write out what transpired in a better fashion than just listing it.\n\nOur group consisted of:  \nMike C.  \nAlex Q.  \nAndrew D.  \nJoe U.  \n\nThe community of Saw-Duum is a small community of around 78 souls, perched on the edge of a mighty river. To the south is a large forest, and across the north-west plains lies a mysterious cave.\n\nThe journal of Jomen Ikrit. \n\n-----------Spring-----------  \n**Entry 1.** Our community has survived the winter. The river did not freeze, so we still have plenty of fish to eat. The river is a great gift that we have. Unfortunately, most of the crops and livestock died, so we are stuck eating fish for now. The forest to the south will allow us lumber for building of new structures. We have started construction of a fishery, which should help triple our efforts at feeding the community. This is good. Explorers have discovered another community called Gomer-Rah to our east, a group of nature lover‚Äôs who abhor technology.\n\n**Entry 2.** A group of children following the river‚Äôs path have discovered the wreck of an old barge sticking from the water. After telling the adults, a crew went about to free it from the sand and perhaps fix this wreck, allowing us river travel. This could prove useful.\n\n**Entry 3.** We have a problem with the shack where the fisherman keep the fish they catch. It is horribly constructed and does not provide adequate shelter, the fish go bad very easily. They need to fix this. But in other news, we did find a crater to the north-east of the village.\n\n**Entry 4.** A tornado has destroyed a large swath of the forest. We do not know how it formed, this was a freak occurrence. But the good news is that there is a lot of downed wood, we have started a project to help retrieve as much as we can. This should help the building of the fishery.\n\n**Entry 5.** A question about the sleeping quarters of the village has been addressed by a few concerned members. The cloth tents we have will certainly not help keep many alive during the cold winter months to come. We have finally fixed up the barge and it is ‚Äòseaworthy‚Äô. The fishery was soon finished afterwards as well. What a productive time it is. We have decided to send a small group to the sister community, in hopes that we can maintain some trade or at least a friendly presence.\n\n**Entry 6.** We have gathered the rest of the wood, we have plenty for building and fires. But the fisherman keep trying to step over everyone‚Äôs business. They think they are so great because they help feed the community, we all do our part. Very troubling. We have organized a crew of six that are skilled enough to navigate the river, and are sending them downriver to investigate what lies beyond the horizon.\n\n**Entry 7.** No one has done anything about the fish shack yet, we‚Äôre losing valuable food with this foolishness. It is asinine to hold this off any longer. Our group has returned from the sister village. It seems that they are nature worshippers. We held a discussion on how to approach them. Most want to leave them alone, we are a small and defenseless community after all, but there are few that say we invade and take their supplies! Imagine that, an invasion of twenty men with pointed sticks!\n\n**Entry 8.** A young lady named Lilif has approached with a rather disgraceful plan. She believes that she can seduce a member of the sister community‚Äôs priesthood and gain this trust. What this harlot wants to do could look bad for our community, but the majority voted in favor. She went on her way.\n\n**Entry 9.** Korem just celebrated his 115th birthday, he is by far the oldest of us all. We joke that it‚Äôs our fish diet that keep us so long-lived and spry, but it might actually be! Lilif came back, with surprising news. Her horrid act worked, but she herself converted to the nature religion of the sister community! She has started a small project to build a shrine in the southern forest. But I guess this means that the other community is on friendly terms with us.\n\n**Entry 10.** Quite the commotion at the weekly meeting! Old Barnabas, who has been with us for many seasons, broke down and confessed to a dark past. He told us all of his younger years, when he was a brutal warlord that killed and enslaved possibly hundreds of lives, and burned dozens of villages. He expected himself to be exiled, but the group allowed him to stay, and they actually formed the idea to use his training to create a militia!\n\n**Entry 11.** Further exploration of the crater has revealed that the center holds a pool of sickly brown water that is not appealing to man nor beast. Lilif has finished her nature temple in the woods, and a small following worship with her there each morning as the sun rises. Barnabus has also started to train the able bodied men (about 16) in the ways of attacking. They will be the basis of our militia.\n\n**Entry 12.** The expedition from downriver has returned this week! They bring news of fascinating sights and dangerous exploits. They encounters many groups and wondrous creatures, and came back with the oddest of technology! They said that this sort of thing was quite common in the outside world far from our community. Also, two boys were caught fighting after attempting to break into Lilif‚Äôs Temple. The community has had enough of this floozy‚Äôs shenanigans, and she was sentenced to remain in her precious temple for the rest of her days. All this excitement has kept us distracted from working on any projects.\n\n-----------Summer-----------  \n**Entry 13.** The first week of summer is upon us! Barnabas has had great gains in training our men and the militia seems ready for anything! Now we have protection, this is sure exciting! Those working to log the forest have also discovered that past the deepest reaches, it suddenly cuts off into a cliff! We cannot see the bottom, which is quite amazing!\n\n**Entry 14.** When the day‚Äôs rations were brought to the nature temple, Lilif was found missing. This one has given us far more trouble than she might be worth! Search parties were organized to find her, combing the forest. She couldn‚Äôt have gotten far.\n\n**Entry 15.** It didn‚Äôt take long, they found her near the cliffside. However, one man fell and is most definitely dead. This is the first death we‚Äôve had since the end of winter, and there was much morning. Lilif was locked back away into her temple, and we started work making sure she couldn‚Äôt leave again. This would be her prison now.\n\n**Entry 16.** Troubling news. The bears that lived in the mysterious cave to the north-west have gotten more bold, and snatched a young boy who was carrying the day‚Äôs catch to the fish shack. I keep mentioning that this shack is a problem, but the bear‚Äôs aggressiveness is frightening. Our newly formed militia has been mobilized to smoke out the bears and hopefully drive them away.\n\n**Entry 19.** A small detachment of militia has been sent to deal with the bears. I suspect they can handle themselves. The temple is now secure, and Lilif will not be escaping again. We have settled on trusted female guards as the priestess‚Äô ‚Äòwiles‚Äô do not work on them. Bad news also. A group of raiders has apparently followed our barge back to us, and are camped to the south.\n\n**Entry 20.** We have agreed that with our new militia, we should attack the raiders before they become more of a problem. Barnabas has been given the go ahead to start training the militia in better tactics, working as small unit teams to be more efficient.\n\n**Entry 21.** The detachment has returned, having killed several bears and driven the rest away. Nothing worse than a few bad wounds, but the doctor can attend to them. A wonderful prize was found inside the cave, a cache of ranged weapon that seem to propel metal pellets. This is a great advantage for our militia, and the new find has been incorporated into the training. Also, we‚Äôve organized another six men to navigate up the river, and see what there is to find to the north.\n\n**Entry 22.** Dark days are ahead I think. Only one survivor came back from the upriver expedition, the other five were killed and the barge lost. The survivor is barely lucid, but says they were attacked by some sort of horrible creature. Examination of the cliff has turned up a strange squat structure on its side, but no one is in the mood for exploration.\n\n**Entry 23.** Slade, our esteemed medical expert, has fallen ill this week. While still of sound mind, his body is withered and weak. He has supplied us with a list of things needed to help cure him, and we‚Äôve put out all the stops to help our most valuable asset. In better news, the small unit tactics of the militia is done, they are equipped with the firearms and work as teams now.\n\n**Entry 24.** The loggers have become fed up with the mistreatment of the elitist fishermen. Using the axes of their own trade, they went and severely damaged the fishery. This sets us back at least four weeks as we try to fix the damages and hopefully repair relations as well.\n\n**Entry 25.** The raiders have finally made a move, after weeks of waiting. The attack failed, they were disorganized and seemed to attack more out of desperation than anything. This astounding success for our militia is good for community morale. Barnabas wants to follow through and finish the fight, but most people say to leave them to lick their wounds.\n\n**Entry 26.** An envoy from the raiders came to us today. They need food, many are sick and dying of malnourishment. The group has decided that we will trade them some food for several of the wonderful artifacts they carry. But we will not hesitate to use the militia if the deal goes sour.\n\n-----------Autumn-----------  \n**Entry 27.** The seasons seem to be moving quickly now! A strange group that called themselves The Parish have emerged from the south, saying they had spent some time at the bunker. We allow them among us, but nobody trusts them too much. They talk of ‚Äòsomething good‚Äô happening and I don‚Äôt like the sounds of it myself.\n\n**Entry 30.** The raiders have left us, heading back downriver in preparation of the winter, and mocking us by saying the Frost Shepherds will kill us all. This grim reminder only solidifies our resolve. We have organized several parties to explore the bunker, without the Parish‚Äôs knowledge since they seem so secretive about it. Slade has also returned to a healthy condition thanks to our organized efforts to stabilize him.\n\n**Entry 31.** A body washed up on shore this week. Examination by Slade has determined it to be one from our upriver expedition, Paul. Everything else has been dropped in mourning of this sad news that there really were no other survivors. Slade is going to determine cause of death.\n\n**Entry 32.** A group of scouts have found an abandoned tower to the east of the forest, but with no way of entry, at least from the ground. It is rather perplexing. Slade has determined that Paul and the others were killed by some sort of large beast, one strong enough to crack human bones like twigs, and with multiple limbs for such a ferocious attack. This is troubling.\n\n**Entry 33.** Many are sick. Slade has his hands full trying to care for all of those with the disease. It has become so bad that the community has made a motion to quarantine all the sick into the north-east cave until they can be healed.\n\n**Entry 34.** A young boy, Alex, is the first to die from the disease, but others soon start dying as well. There is little we can do for them. There is a motion to move the fishery, away from the sick who might possibly infect the food supply, but after the four weeks we just spent fixing it, the majority decided to keep it in place.\n\n**Entry 35.** The healthy scouts working around the tower have discovered that its surface is metal, it is something made by those with a level of technology far greater than ours. With no access on the walls, scaffolding is being created to reach the top.\n\n**Entry 36.** A freak wind, similar to the tornado that struck us so long ago, has claimed several lives of the scaffolding crew. While this should be a sign we should quit now, those behind the project flex their muscles and demand we continue! Have they no shame for those dead?\n\n**Entry 37.** They have gone and done it. The ground around the structure cannot support the scaffolding they are trying to build, and more have died as a result! The shifting ground has revealed an entrance into the structure, but at this point who wants to deal with it?\n\n**Entry 38.** The Parish say that they must leave, and they have taken the sick with them! We let them of course, but now there are only twelve of us left! We are severely depleted, and with winter coming we really don‚Äôt have a hope of surviving. \n\n**Entry 39.** A small group entered the strange structure to explore, and one of their number, Sudaj, tried to lock them inside. His sabotage was discovered and he was stopped, and brought before the community. He stated his reasoning was that if some more people died, we‚Äôd give up messing with the structure. We agreed that it was a bad idea, and declared the structure of limits, but exiled Sudaj.\n\n**Entry 40.** We received word from the raider group that plagued us months ago, and they warned us that the creature that attacked the upriver expedition would most likely move south for the cold months and directly into our path. We started to fortify the fishery in case this happens. Winter is almost upon us.\n\n(CONTINUED IN COMMENTS)",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2dl5xh/dungeon_world_stop_lighting_me_on_fire/",
        "text": "So yesterday I decided to host a One Shot, because I wanted to get some experience as a GM. I had 3 people interested, and had them decide what of the three plotlines to use.\n\nWe had a plotline about a Penguin Army Invading, we had a plotline about a string of murders in a growing Necropolis (I decided to make a City that was quickly growing, with a near majority of it's population being undead, and true neutral), and lastly, the plot I used for my Iron GM attempt, an Illusionist's Mansion and her descent into madness.\n\nWe had two votes for Penguins, one for Illusionist, and only one of each showed up. So, the Illusionist vote agreed to play Penguins. I aided them a little bit in character creation. One guy had never played DW, but was picking it up fast. He chose a Templar, and the other chose a Dragon Mage. Essentially, it's like a Weredragon, but better. I started them off in The Marquise's Court, or close to her War Room. Our Fronts had it down that the reason they agreed to assassinate the Penguin General, well The Templar hated penguins as they were heretical (swimming, flgihtless birds, 'twas UTTER BULLSHIT to him), and the Dragon Mage had heard of treasure (His draconic desire was classic treasure). The Intel they had was that he was short, and that it was a he. I originally wrote The General as female, but no matter! Their personal reason, well The Templar's family had been slain by Penguins. This works for a one shot, so no worries. The Dragon? I forgot, I think he said the treasure again.\n\nNow, it being a one-shot, I decided to not pull punches, to make these penguins easy to defeat (1 HP), but to make them, well, larger in number. I also had a prewritten plot that The Marquise wanted them to assassinate The General, that while she was a border town, and was tasked with guarding borders, her militia were still recovering from a recent war, and she wanted to give them more time to prepare for the advancing army. The Army was traveling along a creak/stream that went southeast to the lake that was to the north of the town. These Penguins had also obliterated a nearby kingdom. Not this army, but as a whole advancing penguin forces had destroyed a kingdom. The assassination wouldn't make this small army that had been sent to invade crumble, but it would give needed time to send calvalry, and probably to just prepare.\n\nThey set off through the woods to the north, heading to intercept the army. They encounter in the snow a squad of 3 scouting penguins. They're kinda just wandering and waddling about, not doing much important. They stalked these penguins for a few minutes, and when one started flapping it's arms, The Templar rushed it. He speared the penguin on his sword, lifted it up, as it slid to the base. The other Penguins started shrieking in fear, honking repeatedly, as The Templar let it slide to the hilt of the sword. Dalamar, the Dragon Mage went in after to burn the penguins. Sir Wellington The Templar decided he'd throw the penguin at one of the other penguins, the one that was moving to peck him. Now this is where stuff gets interesting. First Dalamar's flames go haywire and light Sir Wellington's boots on fire. Sir Wellington has to step back a few yards to throw the penguin off his blade, and it lands on the one he targets, and it collapses under the weight.\n\nDalamar swings his sword to slay the penguin about to peck him, nearly chopping it's head off, only to see 2 squads of scouting penguins arrive. 3 each, one squad to the north of Sir Wellington, one to his west. Dalamar from my memory screams \"RUN!\" and Sir Wellington tries to run to the lake to put out his flaming feet. As Sir Wellington escapes the hostile penguins, he trips over a pebble at the edge of the clearing. Dalamar swings his unarmored arms to his side, and invites the penguins to attack. 6 penguins swarm him, and their pecking knocks him to his knees, breaking the skin in many places, causing him to bleed profusely.\n\nDalamar funfact time: Dalamar's draconic blood lights flesh on fire, so the penguins all die pecking him. By the time he's pushing the corpses up off himself, Sir Wellington is relaxing with his feet in the Lake. He spots the Army making their way up far north down the stream. Dalamar catches up, and they decide to sneak up on the enemy. Sir Wellington's armor clinks, sloshes, and makes sloppy noises that only draw attention, as Dalamar's flaming, bleeding body is a sight on the shoreline. The Army sends a floating light, known as a Penguin Egregore. This is where our heros spend about five minutes just trying to figure out what the wispy light above is, and what it is doing. It is slowly giving Sir Wellington Frostbite. Dalamar standing behind tries to light it on fire. This results in Sir Wellington's head becoming lit, and the Egregore avoiding any pain. Sir Wellington panics, spreads his legs wide, and slams his head into the deep snow to put himself out. The Egregore swings downwards to strike Sir Wellington, and Dalamar tries to save his friend. He only ends up lighting his ally's ass on fire, leading his ally to promptly sit on his ass, after being slashed by the ehtereal being. He raises his shield, and Dalamar breathes fire once again, failing to light his foe on fire, and lights Sir Wellington's shield on fire. Sir Wellington throws his shield into the air in an attempt to kill the floating beast, and this Egregore dodges quickly. The shield lands onto Sir Wellington, denting his armor, and harming him not too deeply, but it did hurt. The light gets in a slash at Dalamar, and he finally lights his target on fire. It succumbs to the flames shortly after, as the two notice a party of 7 penguins, 2 bearing scimitars, advancing on their position.\n\nThe heros panic once again, and decide to flee for their lives. Sir Wellington speeds off, and trips over another pebble. Dalamar makes it a short distance, and The Penguins are catching up to him. Sir Wellington slows somehow, and while Dalamar moves back, now the penguins are upon both of them. Quickly, Dalamar transforms into a Dragon, but he has two overwhelming desires, to steal the Scepter that The General holds, and to slay The Templar, who is a beacon of law and order. This resulted in the penguins becoming confused, as The Templar started taking hits from his own ally, and he swung at the penguins. One of the scimitar holding one slashed the armor, and began to run away, drawing a very thin chord of blood with it to the Army. Sir Wellington chases after the Penguin, as Dalamar breathes fire upon the penguins about to attack him, and flies off to steal the scepter.\n\nSir Wellington slays the penguin, and severs the blood chord, recognizing the technique used to draw blood and drag it out across a distance for varying purposes. Now, an armored penguin accompanied with two scimitar bearing ones moves from the army, and it slams into Sir Wellington. It begins frying on his armor, which is blessed, as the Slashers begin stabbing Sir Wellington. Dalamar sees The General slam his Scepter down into The Lake, and it begins to freeze over from that point. Tackling The General, who took the Scepter with him, they duke it out. The General is lit on fire, only to summon his Egregores to cool him and reduce the effect of the flames. Another attack, and The General Sq'k, a half elven, half pengkin (a dumb name I came up to call the actual race that was commanding these penguins and training them) goes down, dying. He manages to stab his scepter into the dragon, which begins to freeze him over, killing him.\n\nDalamar rises in a fury as a True Dragon. He proceeds to burninate the approaching penguins, and then swallow the scepter. He begins to choke on The Scepter like a Dog on a Chickenbone, as Sir Wellington, damaged, slays the penguins by swinging his sword in a wide arc, slashing their throats. He takes advantage of the army in awe, and begins slaying droves of penguins, spinning through the army. His sword bounces off the armor of another Penguin Guardian, who begins the classic rocking back and forth. Dalamar manages to swallow the scepter as the lake is freezing over, now a quarter frozen, but it goes down the wrong tube, and lands in one of his lungs, freezing him from the inside out like the deceased General originally intended. He turns, and begins breathing fire over the advancing army, lifts up into the air, and breaths fire down upon the entire army.\n\nThis, slays all of the army, along with his ally. His ally rises as a Righteous Champion of The Lord, ready to punish the only deserving being nearby (the fishermen stranded on the freezing lake aren't that evil), Dalamar The Dragon. They begin to duke it out. A Templar turned Champion who is invincible, and a Flying Dragon reigning flaming death from above. Slowly, the dragon freezes over, and soon, a Dragon-sicle falls from the sky. By dying, he takes Sir Wellington's life, and crushes his corpse beneath his weight. The Scepter breaks inside, as the bodies burn from the dragon's exposed flaming blood.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nI was going to write up the Afterlife Entry, but they were really tired, and the game was over. They'd succeeded in their objective, so true, but, they both died.\n\nThis army of originally 100 strong had fallen to two men powerful and trained, but it was only the first invasion force. I revealed that The Town's primary source of income was fishery from The Lake, which had frozen over. Luckily, they had stopped it from spreading to the river that passed through town.\n\nThe Fisherman would cross the lake (100% frozen over) and relay the dying acts of two heroes.\n\nI was a bit too aggressive, but this was a really fun game, and my players had fun.",

They realise they're in the Outlands, and in an abandoned Quarry. The area is heavily polluted, grime seems to cling to the air. In the mud there is an obvious wagon wheel imprint and the party decide to follow it, assuming it would be the Khaasta's escape vehicle.  \n  \nA slow trudge manages to get them encumbered with mud, grime and dirt. The sky is dark and overcast. The party see a building, not far from the trail, and only slightly sunken into the earth. They decide it might provide decent cover from a polluted storm.  \n  \nThe party approach the doors and suddenly a figure bursts out, a deformed [mindflayer](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20060823144751/forgottenrealms/images/4/44/Mind_flayer_sorc.jpg) that flails and collapses into the mud, crawling through the muck when suddenly it's head implodes into it's neck, like it was poked in by some giant unseen finger. The party examine the body, then enters the building where another mindflayer writhes in pain on a circular stone dais in the centre of the room. It shrieks telepathically into the adventurer's minds \"Our great Maanzecorian is dead, the secrets are lost!\" as it gurgles and dies.  \n  \nKnowledge flows from the inactive portal in the room in whispers, the party gleam some truely useless secret knowledge and then the room is still again. They dispose of the corpses and check around for loot. They find comfortable living space and a barrel of preserved brains that have been magically stored with the preserve organ spell. They destroy these and decide to camp out here to avoid the storm. They investigate the portal, but it's closed and they can't gleam any information from it. They decide to destroy it and the stonework around it.  \n  \nAn hour later the doors swing open and in floats a [Beholder](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111130545/3605732-8988725684-tumbl.jpg). Sensing a great surge of power his lord has sent him to see what has happened, he charms one of the party and demands to know what happened here. The party is scared as the creature is much stronger than they are... but knowing they can either try to fight or flight, they fight... the creature lets loose with powerful magics and places the casters within it's antimagic gaze. People come close to death, heroes lives are on the line with every saving throw but the party is pulling through surprisingly well, people are on low health due to successful disintegration saves, the warlock has managed to avoid being disintegrated, finger of death'd and put to sleep... and then it happens the flying Warlock plummets to the ground like a stone...because he's be petrified and is now a Warlock Statue.  \n  \nThe Beholder has retreated at this point, the only one who can catch it is the Paladin who flies past it on his Drakkensteed...and misses with his Lance, he switches to a Magic Rapier and plunges it deep into the beasts brain (critical smite evil). The beast dies, falls and plunges into the mud covering the heroes in pollution.  \n  \nThe party decide to retreat back to Sigil and get the warlock back to normal.  \n  \n**Session 5**  \n  \nSo the party return to Sigil and go to their store and shower, then go find people who can help.  \n  \nThe Duskblade goes to the Hunter's Gentleman's Club and becomes a full member, having killed an impressive beast. Sir Hunter Huntington also suggests he may be able to unpetrify his friend with Gorgon or Cockatrice blood. He suggests an alchemist and the Duskblade buys a salve that when mixed with Gorgon or Cockatrice blood would unpetrify someone it was rubbed onto. He also thought Basilisk might work at a stretch...but was unsure.  \n  \nThe Favoured Soul discussed researching a Stone to Flesh [incantation](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/magic/incantations.htm) with the Guild of the Great Wyrm, they quoted him a 3000 gold reagent cost and 12 days to develop the ritual.  \n  \nThe Paladin met up with the Duskblade and went to Tradegate, in an attempt to buy Gorgon, cockatrice or basilisk blood. Eventually they found a trader with Gorgon blood, but he wanted 4,500gp for a vial. The Cleric suggested 2,000gp and the trader told them to stop wasting his time. The Cleric then asked to see the blood, which I thought was suspicious, so i had the vendor roll sense motive, get a 20 and show the Cleric a booby trapped vial. The Cleric noted which vial this was then offered another lowball estimate and was told to shove off. The vial put back. The Cleric came back later and had his cohorts distract the merchant whilst he pilfered the vial. (Everyone in the room was groaning at this point, it wasn't exactly the heist of the century, especially with his really low rolls.) I told him he succeeded, he looked surprised, he went and gave the vial to the Duskblade and they started walking off with it.  \n  \nThat's when the trap went off. The Cleric, Paladin and Duskblade rolled reflex, the paladin succeeded and took some minor glass cuts. The Rogue and Duskblade failed, took more damage and were bright pink...like a lurid, fluorescent pink. \nThe Paladin walked off to a trader and bought Basilisk blood for 3000gp, haggled down to 2,900gp because charisma.  \n  \nThe guards came running into the street of the giant pink explosion, a known thief deterrent, and noticed the two pink individuals. I described them as large men in armour, with tower shields, swords and slowly approaching, they got within 10 feet, two from the front and two from behind until they encircled them.The Cleric was telling the Duskblade the whole time \"waaaait, waaaaait\" and then he threw a smoke stick at the ground, completely enveloping himself...and just himself... not the Duskblade. Who cursed at the Cleric, cast expeditious retreat and sprinted past a guard... who used his readied action to slam the Duskblade with his shield, which forced him into a flanked position between two guards, he continued his run action which provoked from both guards, now flanking him..and he got shield bashed from both sides at once, dealing enough damage to drop him to single digits, and enough bonus damage from being \"walled in\" to drop him into negatives. The rear guards readied actions by the smoke, the Cleric dived out to heal the duskblade, the guards couldn't hit him with their suddenly meagre attack rolls... the duskblade regains conciousness and it swiftly knocked straight back out by the suddenly again-competent guard. The Cleric surrenders on the condition he can heal the Duskblade, the Guards let him, then give him the spellcaster's manacles (around each finger, thumb and wrists) for the smoke and magic healing, he also gets a Rod shaped mouth gag. The Duskblade is assumed to be a non-magic user based on their observations, so he gets regular manacles.  \n  \nThey go to prison and get left there for 24 hours. The Party back in Sigil (paladin included) wonders where they got to..and proceed to heal the warlock.  \nThe Warlock becomes fleshy again, breathes a sigh of relief and falls flat on his face. His legs feel numb, he tries to regain feeling in them when it suddenly dawns on him...he's paralysed from the waist down. The party talk and the Paladin realises he bought the experimental ingredient on the Duskblade's advice as he forgot to mention that last one was a bit dodgy.  \n  \nIn the Jail cell the merchant identifies the Cleric as the Thief and doesn't wish to press charges against the Duskblade, they release him and he returns to Sigil. He tells them about the Cleric and they chew him out over the Basilisk Blood. The Warlock is kinda pissed at losing the ability to walk over 1,600gp. (Out of character it was funny, in character he was distraught).  \n  \nThey decide to pay the fines and free the Cleric, he signs a confession and is let out of Jail for 1,500gp and has an Arcane Mark planted on his forehead, should he try to steal in Trade-Gate again he'll be cursed harshly.  \n  \nThey then get back to the news that the Duskblade \"won\" the Hunter's guild monthly Bounty and he receives a shed ton of loot in magical items, armour and Platinum. (about appropriate for a beholder) He splits it with the party and people are generally okay. Everyone is back, the Warlock can fly 24/7 so he's not crippled as a character, he's just going to have issues anywhere magical flight doesn't work.  \n  \nThe guild of the great wyrm summon the favoured soul and he tells them he doesn't need the incantation anymore but thanks them, he and the Paladin talk to the Archivist (they suspect he is an Ancient Metallic Dragon but can't work out which type). They discuss the cult of Tiamat, The Archivist promises them aid, but attempts to stay out of the affairs of mortals, he worked hard for his hoard of knowledge and relevant solitude, he wishes to remain that way, but they can use his library and advise as they need it.  \n  \nThe Paladin is attempting to restart an order of Dragonriders, and this is a solid first step.  \n  \nSo endth the session, and they never even tried to hunt down the Flame-Spawned Gorgon I had roaming the Volcanoes around Torch.  \n  \n[Next Story](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ewtct/wizards_walking_dwellings_wood_woads_and_women_dd/)",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2dj6n2/story_a_report_on_the_community_of_wow/",
        "text": "(This story is based on real events that happened in 2013. I have changed all names at request of the members I still have contact with.) \n\nHi, my name is James. I'm 15 and I love games from the mid 90s to the early noughties. This ranges from Star Trek Armada, Star Trek Brigde Commander, look just like loads of games. INCLUDING, Blizzard's Warcraft series.\n\nI got some of them for dirt cheap at a garage sale and I played them a lot on my shitty computer. \n\nHowever, before this, I had little interest in the series. I heard about WoW, yet never gave it much thought. However, before my fourteenth birthday I thought I'd give it a shot, seeing as I had fond memories of the original Warcraft series.\n\nThis is more of a report, on the players, and the community, of the popular MMO, World of Warcraft. I hope you enjoy.\n\nI was very naive when I made my character, so I made it the worst race in the game. That's right, Kung-Fu Panda. I named my fat friend Bulmheim, because... Why not? I began the game, watched the intro and finally entered the world of Warcraft. It's art-style reminded me of Warcraft... A bit.\n\nHowever the game was completely different to my beloved original games. In WoW, the start zones are crap so I'll skip that part.\n\nI chose to be apart of the Horde faction, and then I set foot in Ogrimmar. First thing that I thought was: \"Fuck me, this place is huuuuuuuge!\" It took me a while to find my away around the complex of players and merchants, but I got used to it.\n\nThen I noticed something in chat. \n\n\"Spirits of Nature, Guild! LF New recruits! We do raids and we RP!\"\n\nI PMed the player who said this, his name was Majestyk. I joined this Spirits of Nature guild and began to have a conversation with its members. Firstly, I met a girl called Ayan. She was Majestyk's girlfriend in real life, and they were both around my age. We became very friendly with each other and they helped me with getting started.\n\nI met the rest of the gang, as I added Majestyk and Ayan to my skype. Soon I was greeted by the two heads of the guild.\n\nOne was named Toraun, and he was awesome. Then I met the deputy of the guild, let's call him Douche. Douche, hence his name, was a massive fuckwit to me and other players. \n\nI wanted to raid with them, so I levelled up and up, trying to reach their level. I was naive back then when I was playing I didn't know it took like 5 months to get to level 20. \n\nWhen I was doing a quest, a new member of the guild logged on. His name was Markus, and was 14 as well as me at the time. He was quite odd, as sometimes he was nice and sometimes he was a fuckwit. \n\nOutside of the guild, I met some... Odd characters in the chat of Ogrimmar. One of them was known as Clockwerk. He was a sexist, racist, homophobic troll who was instantly added to many people's ignore list.\n\nA few months passed, I integrated myself into the guild and now was a respected member. I had however, had a fight with another member. Her name was Erenhart, she was a massive bitch like seriously. I was enjoying the game, battling pets because Blizzard one day thought it would be funny to rip off Pokemon.\n\nMajestyk was flirting with his Internet GF Ayan, when some guy- let's call him Firefox- did something that pissed Majestyk OFF. \n\nFirefox: Emma (Ayan) and OJ (Majestyk) sittin' in a tree, F.U.C.K.I.N.G! \n\nMajestyk: wtf r u chatting m8? \n\nBulmheim(me): Calm down it was a joke fam.\n\nMajestyk: i swear 2 god i will beet u up 4 this irl.\n\n(I pissed myself laughing when I read that. Anyway, Firefox had a go at him, Toraun intervined and Majestyk kicked Firefox from the guild. I invited him back while PMing Markus on skype, telling him shit was going down on Guild chat)\n\nBulmheim: OJ calm down pls\n\nMajestyk: stfu james, who invted u 2 this argument?\n\nMajestyk acted like a complete prick, Ayan had logged off. I thought that this was gonna get out of hand so I logged off.\n\n----------------\n\nNext morning I log on, and a couple of members are online. I ask what happened when I left and they told me OJ got kicked out of the guild and so did Firefox, because he said some... Questionable things about Ayan's fanny. I knew I should've stuck with OJ in that fight, but I didn't wanna lose dat street cred. \n\nI told Emma about this, and she left the guild. Then Toraun did a douchebag clean out and got rid of all the douches in the guild. Soon Toraun left WoW to focus on his music, but before he left he sent me a letter in the games mailbox.\n\nHe said he thought that I was a good person, and he thought that I would do great things. After a month, things fell apart in the guild, and Douche sold it.\n\nFor a year I kept in touch with OJ, Emma and Markus. I am still in touch with Markus, however OJ and Emma stopes talking to me after we had a stupid arguement.\n\nSo basically guys, when playing WoW...\n\nDon't join a guild.",

        "text": "A little backstory to start with. Some friends and I recently started up a gaming group and last night had our first session. Of course, the DM also decided to drop out last minute, but to hell with letting that stop us! (He has stuff going on anyway so we get it.) Anyway, I'm pretty new to this, having only really played Mutants and Masterminds a few times before, two more of us know a little more, and the last two are actually experienced with Pathfinder and/or gaming sessions in general. The guy who knows the most about all this is nice enough to run the game, but also wants to play, so we pick some module he has but never did before and run with it. \n\nThe group is as follows. I play a Ratfolk Alchemist Psychonaut who's a traveling drug dealer and a pretty decent guy if you don't look at the addictive and kleptomaniacal tendencies. His name is Stan the Rat. There's also a Tengu Witch and a Grippli Gunslinger who travel together. The Grippli, named Gleep, doesn't speak common and the Tengu, Nekhet, doesn't wear clothes and nat20's a good 80 percent of her Intimidate rolls. Instead of a familiar, she has a homemade baby doll stitched together out of flesh and teeth, as she's a Gravewalker. \nThere's a gnome summoner named Dindeep, who's sort of an asshole to us but she's so damn charismatic that we don't care. Her Eidolon is some weird Miyazaki looking giant ferret thing. Lastly, we have Zeravica (I call her Z), a Dwarf fighter who fucks up at most things she tries. Seriously, her rolls are the worst.\n\nSo that's the party! I won't outline our first session, but rather, our first real fight. It was technically our second random encounter, but the first was an undead Kobold that I killed immediately.\n\nIt's our second night on the road during our quest. The first night I got the last guard shift and decided to run off and chase woodland creatures. (I got back before anyone noticed. Between this and reverse pickpocketing stolen items into their bags, the gang is already used to me rolling my way through generally being an asshole to them. But let's be fair, we're all dicks to each other. It's fun!)\nThis time I decide to go for the last guard shift again, because I like to push the limits of what I can get away with here. Tonight, however, the god of random encounters had something different in mind.\n\nI may not have mentioned it before, but we're all first level. A bunch of losers on a quest to gather some rare materials so that the people with actual talent can battle a plague destroying a city. Little did we know, however, the extent of our loserdom.\n\nAnyway, Dindeep the gnome takes first watch. Just so happens that the guy playing her also is running the game. He looks at the module, rolls a couple times, and says \"Well, shit. Roll for perception.\" We all fail. \"Alright. Well, a bigass snake attacks...\" roll. \"Nekhet.\"\n\nShe failed her initiative and pretty much everything after and got grappled. I wake up first, but have to get my weapon and get over to her. So does everyone else, through the Grippli wakes up one turn after the rest of us. I have a crossbow but I don't want to risk shooting her, nor does our little frog gunslinger with her pistol, because we both have great dex scores and our resident witch has no armor and an HP of 8. The snake almost immediately takes out half of her health, even while getting bitten, because she keeps rolling minimal damage. \n\nI try to stab it, but I have a -1 strength modifier, so I don't even hit it. Even if I did, I'm small size with a dagger. What can I really do? Our gnome has a spear, but upon attacking, rolls a 1. He asks our tengu player \"High or low, bad or really bad?\" Long story short, he rolled some percentages and whatnot and luckily did not deliver the killing blow to our witch, but instead broke the spear! His (her, characterwise) eidolon misses too, but the dwarf hits the snake pretty hard with her hammer. \n\nThe snake now brings our witch down to 2 hp. I attack it and miss again, the Grippli does the same. The gnome and her creature hit but don't do much. But here's the kicker. The dwarf rolls a 1 on her to hit, but a pretty good bit of damage that would definitely land the killing blow on our now panicking bird friend. So the question is asked again.\n\n\"High or low, bad or really bad?\" \n\nAnd by some streak of luck, it instead hits the Grippli, only halving her HP. Oh, and sending her flying, because she's only about 20 pounds. You know, come to think of it, how can a 20 pound frog even fire a gun accurately? Whatever, not the point.\n\nThe witch now has one crucial moment. Bite the snake and try to kill it or run it off. And the bite is fantastic. Critical hit. The snake decides this isn't worth it and while it runs, we all stomp it into the ground. \n\nThere's silence for a while, both in and out of character, as we're just holding our heads in our hands. \n\n\"What the fuck was that, guys? Really?\" Says our gnome. I heal the Gleep and Nekhet, because Stan the Rat so far only has one talent that benefits more than just him. Our dwarf says \"I want to skin the snake!\" Our tengu says \"I want to try and preserve the meat for later.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" says DM guy. \"Roll for survival.\"\n\nDwarf gets a 1, tengu gets a 2. \n\n\"Alright. You slice your hand open on accident instead, and meanwhile you ruin the meat.\"\n\n\"Fuck, man,\" I say, seriously considering doing some dice shaming pictures. \"Well, hey, at least the night's over.\"\n\n\"Oh, no it isn't,\" I'm told, \"You still have two watch shifts left before sunrise.\"\n\n\n\n\n(Thanks for reading. There may be more tales from the fuckups of Stan the Rat and friends to come. After all, the sessions are weekly.)\n",

        "text": "This is the story about how the lowest charisma character I have ever made spit out a lie that shouldn't have worked. and when I say low charisma I mean low charisma, this man was about as charming as a malignant tumor, he was forced to take a vow of silence for a while because the party hated the sound of his voice and said they would kill him if he kept talking, also he's not allowed to meet important people.\n\nSo our party, who are all evil by the way for the campaign (part of the cult of asmodeus or something, I dunno i'm not particularly religious) are working their way through a magical maze to get to this sacred flame person so we can kill her and unleash our army of devils on them or something. I'm with the group and letting my minions do most of the fighting since I became a vampire as a story option a while back. we reach the clearing in the maze where we see who we assume to be the flame and some other dude standing next to a bonfire that produced an effect like true daylight (no bueno for vampire) \n\nsince we had come across one of these before my character knew what to do and he threw a bottle of unholy water into the fire, putting it out. the two people in the clearing freak out and start shouting 'who did that?' 'i'm a good person!' 'hurdahurrdahur I liek Mitra gawdess of good'\n\nso I get a ridiculous idea that I don't think for a second will work but we're going to fight and kill these people anyways so why not. I step out into the clearing and shout \"Hello, I am a vampire that has been cursed with a soul and I must travel the world doing good ever more, sorry about your fire but it would have killed me before I could warn you of the danger you're in\"\n\nyes, I lied with the backstory for Angel. \n\nand it fucking worked. I don't know how and probably the DM gave me a bonus because my bluff amused her so much but neither of them rolled high enough on sense motive to think I was lying. I then introduced my companions and made small-talk while the party assassin snuck behind them while invisible and hit the fire chick hard enough to explode her heart out through her chest.\n\ngood times, I also tackled an actual angel out of the sky but that's another story",

        "text": "The audio log is \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwsr0_kEk2VbekZZOUxQVWpXczQ/edit?usp=sharing\n \nhere, and you can see that I quite happily sacrifice truth for drama. \n\nWe rejoin the game with Crumbles getting a phone call, and everyone in the Teamspeak dancing on the edges of their seats.  We've got a guest star, and this girl has a _rep_.  The poor bastard's phone call was from one of his contacts, and he had a job for the crew that rescued the courier so very, very quickly ( see http://www.reddit.com/tb/2cyod8 ).\n\nMr. Johnson has a job for us, and we'd be fools not to accept.  Twenty thousand nuyen for taking a girl to a concert and keeping her from getting murderrapekilled.  Easy money, and five grand a shot is quite compelling.  The job isn't immediate, so we've a few days to prepare - I mosey through the area to familiarize myself with the layout and best places to escape, taking Hotentote with me to drive.  It's not terribly bad, not terribly good.  This area of Seattle is low apartment buildings and alleys, every hotel is booked solid for the upcoming concert.\n\nNot promising.  But not that bad.  The boys flail around on that matrix thing, and find information that surprises nobody.  The girl is the daughter of a Yakuza midboss, and she's a nonentity herself.  Spoiled rich kid.  No problem, really.\n\nI add one item to my arsenal, the ever-handy armor bag.  Worst comes to worst, sackful of rugrat.\n\nThe day of the concert comes, and off we go.  Since Mister Murphy is the fifth member of the party, we leave a lot of time in our schedule, and get to the girl's house significantly early.  This is an excellent thing for us, since traffic is heavier than normal.  \n\nThe girl is amazing.  Completely insulated from the real world, she's corp crazy and completely blind - in a societal sense.  She gets to sit in the back, with Hotentote driving and Elliot riding shotgun.  Crumbles is testing death by riding his bike, since one Americar is only so big...\n\nThe conversation turns to fashion.  We look cooler than her, see..  \n\nSomehow this leads to Crumbles making a Stuffer Shack run for punk accessories, and us spending a few minutes in the parking lot to light the girl on fire.\n\nJust a little bit, see.  And she was armored, so it was fine!\n\nWith her fashion in check, we resume our trip to the concert.  Troll Thrash Metal is the best music.  It's like Disaster Area, with less budget and more soul.  The concert starts, and everyone is on high alert.  Some little worm tries to distract the girl with drugs and alcohol, but we chase him off.  No problem, no stress.\n\nHotentote disagrees.  His watcher spirit follows the worm and finds some rather stress-inducing things...   We go to higher alert, if such a thing is possible.\n\nThat's the reason we notice the guy in the boring clothes carrying a duffle bag.  He's making his way to the stage, and he doesn't look happy.  It's probably not related to us, but it could be a big enough problem that it could harm our primary.  Hotentote agrees, and a stun bolt takes the guy off his legs.  I'm trying to think of what could be in the bag when a horrible thought bubbles up past the pleasant crunch of Troll Metal.\n\nHotentote's not listening.\n\nI hoist the daft bastard to my face and ask him one very important question.  \"BOMB?\"\n\nHe nods.  I fling.  Hotentote goes face first into the duffel bag man and knocks him clean the hell out.  Fortunately, the ork's thick skull keeps him from being disabled, and while the rest of us are getting the girl as far away from the bomb as possible, he runs the bomb -and the bomber- out.  Elliot follows him, and the two of them scamper off to the car.  We manage to calm the girl down, and continue the concert.\n\nIt's a clusterfuck on the way back to the car.  Elliot manages to get the bomb disabled, and stuff it in the car.  The bomber gets put in the trunk, all chained up and bound.  The boys come back to the show, and off we go.\n\nThe girl's snivelling about missing the after party, so we tell her we'll hook her up with a real troll party.  This goes over well, but we need a distraction for the little thing, so I organize a field trip for booze.  This is met with great happiness, except Crumples gets distracted by a sexy purple haired lady in tight leather, who wants to hook up with him later, and then someone bumps the primary.  Not a crowded-area bump, a wallet-removal bump.  Hotentote sends me after the dude, and I get a meathook on him. \n\nWhich slows me down just enough for one of his compatriots to get a needle in me, putting me into a toxic fog of stun damage.  I growl for him to explain, but the second needle turns me into a speedbump.  Face down and useless, I am.\n\nHotentote takes off after the dude, and manages to keep the primary with him.  He gets needled as well, and pinned down behind a magic barrier.  Elliot and Crumples make it to me and find me propped up in an alley, with a dick drawn on my forehead and my helmet full of garbage.\n\nThe boys manage to figure out enough first aid to get me back conscious, then stuff energy drinks down my face hole. \n\nPuke ‚Äòn Rally, boys.\n\nThe Rally part doesn‚Äôt work too well, and I end up falling on top of Crumbles - actually causing stun damage.  We manage to untangle ourselves and make our way to Hotentote, who is hiding behind his mana barrier.  With seven feet of troll drooling on the barrier and the rest of the group there, he drops the shield and we are finally back together and not currently under attack.  A quick sweep of the primary finds that something wasn‚Äôt taken from her - something was dropped on her.  The thing in question is a disc of red plastic, and it‚Äôs active.  Elliot takes it apart on the Matrix level, and it‚Äôs a listening device. \n\nI interrupt the discussion about how to best deal with the listening device by eating it. \n\nOFF TO THE MOSH PIT!\n\nThe rest of the concert passes uneventfully and as we‚Äôre waiting for the crowd to thin a bit before braving the scrum of folks leaving, we get accosted by a brace of suited trolls.  They don‚Äôt waste time with words, closing and opening combat with melee attacks.\n\nMelee attacks are generally a mistake against us.  I take one of them out immediately, and Crumples puts the hurt on another.  He finishes his turn by making a spare machine pistol available to the primary.  Elliot dispenses some ammo, not doing anything but increasing the panic level in the room.  I drop another troll, and the last remaining one pulls a shotgun and unloads a burst into Crumbles, converting him again into a slumped pile of bleeding meat. \n\nLovely!\n\nThe girl reacts to this by screaming and shooting the shotgun troll, who falls.  I take care of the down, we loot the dead, and Crumples ends up in the bitch bag.  We scramble off to the nearest doc, and drop a duffle bag on his table. \n\nUnzipping the bag reveals 25 kilos of explosives.  Back to the car, and the other bag has our bleeding Face.  Crumbles is on the table getting patched up, I snag out one of the baseball bats and hand it over to the girl.  I take the Americar back to the mansion and drop the girl off - warning the humorless oriental gentlemen about the listening device.\n\nWe touch base with Hotentote, Crumbles is OK and they‚Äôre working off the debt at the soup kitchen.  Elliot disappears into the night and I drag myself home for sleep and armor maintenance. \n\n\n\nBut that‚Äôs not all! \n\n\nI remembered that we had the bomb dude in the back of the car, so I got him out the next morning,  This poor bastard gets to wake strapped to a chair, confronted by a roaring troll face and a revving monofilament chainsaw.  He screams and blows his morale checks bad enough that he wets himself in terror, and I‚Äôm pleased.  I cut him loose and kick him out the door, and off into the night he goes. \n\nElliot picked up the bomb bag and moseyed out to the Barrens.  While we had the detonator turned off, now was a good time to _own_ the bomb, make it truly ours.\n\nUnfortunately, he failed.  Managed to run the hell away before the bomb actually blew up, but we‚Äôre still out a perfectly good duffle bag and 25 kilos of boomfun.\n\nCrumbles responds to a text from the sexy purple hair lady and moseys off to her place.  He‚Äôs expecting a love match.\n\n\nShe‚Äôs expecting a meal.  Because she‚Äôs a ghoul.  Crumbles barely manages to survive the encounter, and flees into the night screaming.  His next stop is a Stuffer Shack, where he fortifies himself with booze before crawling home to sleep with his teddy uzi. \n\nAnd that‚Äôs that!\n\nWe‚Äôre looking forward to next session, though unfortunately our guest star won‚Äôt be rejoining us. \n",
