        "text": "About a month ago I wrote this post detailing how deadly nervous I was to learn that Id perform for the first time with a band, https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/111il8v/being_in_a_band_is_scary/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\ntoday was the day?!?! I woke up jittering and had to calm myself down for hours, but thankfully I had the time to do so as we were playing at night. the first time the entire band practiced together was TODAY, an hour before the show, because we all had scheduling conflicts and kept making it at different times\n\nas soon as we started playing, the drummer decided to slow the tempo slower than we’d ever practiced. none of us could hear ourselves. i was for some reason given a chair, and my keyboard was placed on an AMP for a lack of a stand.\n\nbut it all worked out beautifully… i’m so happy. the keyboard solo i always messed the timing up in was perfect for the first time. the mood was amazing. people were jamming, they sang along (even though the song is not very well known here?!?!) all of us were in sync (and we are like 6 people) as soon as we got off stage i wanted to perform more. my friends were in the front row and everything was so so dreamy. \n\ni’ve only been playing piano for a year and a half… i have anxiety &amp; i can’t even practice at home because i can’t afford a keyboard. but i swear to you if you try to do it you can. music is lovely and it is for EVERYONE :)",

It's honestly beyond beautiful. It's dedicated to the artists passing of his younger sister who crossed over back in 2018, a couple months after the release of his album \"Immortalys\". If you want a short description of the album, then the artist gives a good one in the description of the video.\n\nPersonally, this song made me bawl my eyes out as it relates a lot. If you know a heartbreaking loss, you will see what I mean.",
