        "text": "Let me just say that when I watched Black Museum for the first time, I was impressed, being a fan of the very similar (both in format and concepts) White Christmas, which is probably my favourite episode. However, something just didn't sit right with me about it, and I now know why.\n\nThe biggest problem with the episode is its messages, and what it sets out to accomplish by the end. One of Black Mirror's greatest strengths is to get you to think, to worry, and to above all: question the topics and scenarios it demonstrates both in terms of morality and plausibility. This is why episodes like Fifteen Million Merits, White Bear and Shut up and Dance worked so well.\n\nBlack Museum, on the other hand, fails to do this. Worse, it instead tries to encourage viewers to feel a single way that, compared to earlier warnings in episodes, feels worryingly backwards. The events of the episode present Nish's revenge as something justified, something we should root for, complete with happy-go-lucky music and a \"good ending\", but seeing the endless horror of her father's situation earlier in the episode renders this feeling sour. \n\nWhy does it suddenly become justified in revenge? Why is the use of technology any less horrific? Is Rolo's copied consciousness even guilty of the original's crimes to begin with? We saw earlier in the episode that the shared mind system tends to end in tragedy, even with good intentions, so why should we believe it'll be any different for Nish and her mother? Why does it act like Nish's father's torture is over when there are literally still thousands of torture keychains running perfectly around the world, each a perfect replica of her father? Why let the monkey survive, wouldn't it still be a prison?\n\nSo many questions, which could've been effective if left ambiguous, but the episode clearly wants us to support Nish's revenge and end on a happy, \"job-well-done\" note without even considering the horrific undertones of that ending or the lingering questions. \n\nWhat did you think?

        "text": "I had a weird dream the other night that felt like an episode of Black Mirror. I figured I should post it, here.\n\nMy dream was animated in an anime style. It involved a place where people played sports-games, or something.\n\nBetween rounds, patrons would hang out with female robots. The robots all looked like typical anime schoolgirls. There were no rules as to how the robots were treated, and patrons could interact however they wanted.\n\nThis made the place very dystopic for the  robots.\n\nThe place was owned, and operated by a supercomputer called the \"Sitticus\".\n\nEventually, something happened. I don't know exactly what it was, but my guess is that the robots revolted against the humans, and the Sitticus. Whatever it was, the building, and most of the robots were destroyed.\n\nThe one surviving robot (who looked like Monika from Doki-Doki Literature Club) awoke from sleep-mode, and saw the mess. She also found that the Sitticus had mysteriously vanished.\n\nShe sat in the Sitticus' chair, where she became the \"New Sitticus\". She rebuilt the place, and began manufacturing new robots of both genders. The facility was reopened, and new robot-treatment rules were put into place.\n\nThe Monika lookalike robot was able to make the place nicer, and happier than ever-before.\n\nAfter that, I woke up. I realized that this was the deepest, most meaningful dream, I'd ever had. I took a moment to appreciate the strangely beautiful dream, because most of my other dreams are meaningless, nonsensical mind-trips.\n\nI also Googled the word \"sitticus\", and found that it's a type of spider.",

If all of what he says is true, there's no reason for him to know this other than that he was behind this the whole time. When Kenny's robbing the bank, I believe that Hector is accompanying for the pleasure of watching the events unfold, a la Jigsaw in the first saw movie. But what about the ending, in which he is sent the troll face? This organization has shown, via Hector's own confessions, is able to access whatever information it wants to and can. This operation is obviously too large for one person, and I believe that the partner(s) of Hector fabricated his affair using information already available via his computer/phone. --sorry for the formatting, on mobile--",

She killed him, in a hotel full of security cameras, the drives him across town and dumps him in a sewer, without any drone or anything picking up on him? That's what's unbelievable. I have issues with the memory tech being used, and I wished the episode focused on the unreliability of memory, as shown with the girl's coat changing, as the way the story was told the memory tech made mostly no difference to the plot, as Mia would still have been arrested soon after. As for a protagonist, Mia never keeps her head on in any situation, which would have saved her a lot. In fact, if she played her cards right, she might not have faced repercussions even if her ex-boyfriend contacted the widow of the bicyclist, and she never gave any thought to the idea of bribing him, pretending to get back together, stealing the mail or any other rational idea.",

        "text": "It was so... overdone. The acting and dialogue were very cheesy - you could argue the same about parts of USS Callister, except the premise of that was a guy trapping sentient beings in an already cheesy TV show scenario and forcing them to play their roles. The actual characters were much more natural and realistic. In this episode, Rolo Haynes was a real character and just as campy and unbelievable as he let on. The production quality was also fairly lurid and over-the-top - the colorful sets and crazy music didn't have the same charm as something like USS Callister. Not to mention that the whole episode felt like a parody of Black Mirror. Because the three stories we saw were told from the perspective of Rolo, a man who's all about profits and sensationalism and doesn't give a shit about the human aspect of the technology he promotes, we didn't get to see much emphasis on the humanity of the storylines. And what we did get to see was just brushed off by Rolo or not delved into enough because Rolo himself wouldn't care to do so himself. Which meant we just got shallow vignettes of genuinely interesting technology, complete with a cartoonish narration from Rolo, all of which made the whole thing appear only half-serious, bordering on self-parody. And the easter eggs strewn across the museum had no meaning whatsoever beyond just a lazy attempt at \"homage\", giving us a false sense of closure or aftermath to various far superior episodes. Ultimately the episode felt more like I was watching Gotham than Black Mirror.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

It seems if anything, the cookie is copying the mind or actions of a person, which is different from creating an entirely new lifeform. On the other hand, the cookie would act like a human, such as plead for its life before death. I think a good parallel to draw between being human and acting human is Janet from The Good Place (awesome comedy btw). In both cases, the program is trying to act like a human, but is, at its core, a human and can't feel true emotion. Maybe I'm just an a-hole but that's just how I understand it.\n\nGenerally, I loved White Christmas- would put it above Nosedive after watching four and I loved Nosedive. I have also seen the Entire History of You which was fine imo and I wasn't a huge fan of Waldo. Also I haven't seen anything with Hamm in it before (besides cameos in Parks and Rec) and his acting was great in this.\n\nNow I'm probably gonna go to Roko's basilisk hell.",

It is one of humanity's earliest hunting techniques. We may be smaller, weaker, and even slower, but we Never. Stop. Pursuing. No matter what we keep at it. We are always there, no matter how much the prey runs or hides, until the prey is exhausted and can't go on anymore. If it isn't one human, another will pop up and continue. Then we got even smarter. And then we got tools.  \n  It got me thinking. The Boston Dynamics pups use this strategy. No matter what, they pursue once they've got you marked, and even though it's smaller than us, it will get us. We built it in our own image and gave it tools and weapons that the majority of humanity doesn't have acces to. Of course, we got screwed over. The only thing we may have going for us in retaliation is our intellect. It's just too damn effective. Either way I think I appreciate the episode more now.

Sure it‚Äôs lots of shock and awe and plot twists, but ppl told me this show had something to say about society. This episode just screamed that in the future we‚Äôll all be tortured mentally for our crimes. But the way the two guys are tortured seems like a complete waste of time and energy. They should just be dead! \n\nI guess it works as a horrific sci fi story, but ppl told me that this show was deep. It seems to just be ‚Äúworst case scenario‚Äù with a technological twist.\n\nI‚Äôve been watching numerous episodes, and it‚Äôs not Twilight Zone. It‚Äôs not saying many new things about society or technology. It‚Äôs just telling me ‚Äúlook how fucked up technology could maybe, possibly, or probably be in the future.\n\nAm I meant to not take the show seriously at all? Bc it‚Äôs much more enjoyable that way without ppl telling me it‚Äôs deep and intelligent.",

I think Brooker was trying to write her as a sort of emotional conduit while her husband tried to put on a brave face, but it made her character seem really strange and conceited, given the circumstances.",
