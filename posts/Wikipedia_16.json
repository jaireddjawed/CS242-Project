This was strange because it is never taken... I created an account with a very similar username (think \"ManTheBest\" to \"ManTheBest1\" type similar). Today, I looked up the username I would normally use, and found it was actually my own account from 3 years ago I had forgotton about, that was blocked because I put a personal website in my own user page, (blocked for advertisement). At the time I was not doing this maliciously or anything, I just didn't know the rules and was testing out wikipedia, it was literally just a link to the website as my userpage nothing else written. Does this count as block evasion? What can I do?\n\nI know about the 6 month unblock request procedure, but one of the requirements is that you don't block evade. What should I do? I like to help out with articles, and would not like to get banned in future because of this. I suppose getting my actual username back would be a plus too. Thanks for any suggestions.",
