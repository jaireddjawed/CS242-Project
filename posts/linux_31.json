        "text": "My son is huge into 3d printing and we have a NUC that was running Ubuntu 20.04, it was running great and somehow the build got fuxxxed up so we decided to rebuild it.\n\nSame hardware, using Ubuntu 22.04 now - we have ssh installed and Octoprint which is a really slick webservice that allows you to send/monitor/review your 3d prints.   I setup the NUC in my office, did all the standard updates, etc.  I can ssh and use the web services no problem  - this is all over wifi.  I have a pretty robust Unifi setup at home.  \n\nHere's the crazy part.  When I move the NUC to his room and plug it in (of course we have auto-on enabled) the system doesn't respond.  If I move it back to my office, it works great.  The two rooms are 10 feet apart, and both locations are 10-15 feet from the wireless AP.  \n\nWhat is even stranger, is he unplugged from his power strip and plugged directly into the wall outlet and it worked!  So we thought it was maybe a power supply issue with the NUC.  I have an older one, and so I built it up just like the first one.   Same scenario, I build in my office it all works, I can ssh, he can ssh, I can use web interface, he can use the web interface.\n\nI move the 2nd NUC to his office and - nothing!   I've never seen anything like this in my life... So I figured I'd share with r/linux to get some insight or at least some sympathy for my craziness :)\n\ntl;dr - NUC works in my office perfectly, move to my son's room it doesn't work, move back and it works",

        "author": "boutnaru",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/103qxhl/linux_cgroups_control_groups_part_1/",
        "text": " “Control  Groups” (aka cgroups) is a Linux kernel feature that organizes  processes into hierarchical groups. Based on those groups we can limit  and monitor different types of OS resources. Among those resources are:  disk I/O usage , network usage, memory usage, CPU usage and more ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html)).  cgroups are one of the building blocks used for creating containers  (which include other stuff like namespaces, capabilities and overlay  filesystems).\n\nThe  cgroups functionality has been merged into the Linux kernel since  version 2.6.24 (released in January 2008). Overall, cgroups provide the  following features: resource limiting (as explained above),  prioritization (some process groups can have larger shares of  resources), control (freezing group of processes) and accounting ([https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/cgroups.html](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/cgroups.html)).\n\nMoreover,  there are two versions of cgroups. cgroups v1 was created by Paul  Menage and Rohit Seth. cgroups v2 was redesigned and rewritten by Tejun  Heo [https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cgroups](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cgroups) . The documentation for cgroups v2 first appeared in the Linux kernel 4.5 release on March 2016 ([https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/diff/Documentation/cgroup-v2.txt?id=v4.5&amp;id2=v4.4](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/diff/Documentation/cgroup-v2.txt?id=v4.5&amp;id2=v4.4)).\n\nI  will write on the differences between the two versions and how to use  them in the upcoming writeups. A nice explanation regarding the concept  of cgroups is shown in the image below ([https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1214341831049252870](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1214341831049252870)). By the way, since kernel 4.19 OOM killer ([https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-out-of-memory-killer-oom-killer-bb2523da15fc](https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-out-of-memory-killer-oom-killer-bb2523da15fc)) is aware of cgroups, which means the OS can kill a cgroup as a single unit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/b0rk\\/status\\/1214341831049252870\\/photo\\/1 ](https://preview.redd.it/wd4v1kf1x5aa1.jpg?width=1744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e204de908917ccf7a2f5d908085b2731df7a24aa)",

The first mainstream consumer gadget based on Linux released, rust support got in the kernel, and Linux growth has just ballooned ever since the steam deck released. Also a bunch of other cool stuff that I can't remember. With all the work being done currently, what developments are you most excited for in 2023? Personally, I'm really hoping that valve starts trying to get in contact with studios whose anti-cheat doesn't support Linux yet, like the guys who made Genshin Impact. I'm also really excited to see the cosmic desktop, as it'll be nice to get some competition between KDE and gnome as the big two desktop environments that support Wayland.",

        "text": "I am often switching between my work computer and my fixed computer and I have to manually switch the screen input each time I do it. Today, I took it upon myself to automate this.\n\nEach time I am switching between the two computers, I plug a USB hub with the mouse, keyboard and headset to the computer I want to use. So I made a udev rule which detects each time my mouse is plugged in and use ddcutil to switch to the correct screen input. Here is the udev rule (located in \\`/etc/udev/rules.d/switch-screen-input-on-usb-plug.rules\\`):\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nACTION==\"add\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"046d\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"c051\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/sbin/switch-screen-input-on-usb-plug.sh\"\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nAnd the corresponding script:\n\n\\#!/bin/bash\n\nFILE=/tmp/last-udev-scree-switch\n\nlast\\_run=\\`stat $FILE -c %Z\\`\n\nmin\\_delay=$(( \\`date +%s\\` - 30 ))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif \\[ -z \"$last\\_run\" \\] || \\[ \"$last\\_run\" -lt \"$min\\_delay\" \\]; then\n\nddcutil -g AOC setvcp 60 0x0f\n\ntouch $FILE\n\nfi\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nAt first, I just had the ddcutil command in the udev rule but it was executing multiple times when I plugged the hub in causing the screen to flicker. So I made this wrapper script which contains some code to execute the script at most every 30 seconds.\n\nThe vendor and product ID of the USB device can be found using \\`lsusb -v\\` and the capability name and values using \\`ddcutil capabilities\\`. The \\`-g\\` switch for ddcutil selects the screen I am interested in, it is the only one made by the manufacturer AOC.\n\nI was quite amazed that I was able to do this kind of automation with just a few lines of code. Linux is  amazing for this kind of tinkering! I hope this post helps someone who wants to do something similar.",
