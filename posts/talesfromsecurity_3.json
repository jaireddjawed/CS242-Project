        "text": "I'll occasionally receive calls from tenants because they locked themselves out of their apartments, someone's parked in their spot, or because their neighbors are noisy.\n\nHowever, last night, I received a call that was quite unusual. Around midnight I received a call from a restricted number and it was a man with an Indian accent claiming he needed help because a large Mexican man was running outside naked.\n\nSo, I asked the man his name, his building number, and his apartment number. His name and apartment number was fine, but the building number he provided me didn't exist. All the building numbers end in an odd number, and he gave me an even number.\n\nI assumed he meant an odd number, so I rushed to the general area of the buildings with similar numbers. I didn't see anything. Then, I receive a call from my supervisor saying that he's been receiving calls about a suspicious individual on the complex and that he has notified the local police department.\n\nI explained the situation to him and told him that I would check all the building interiors in case the guy managed to get inside. Then I receive a call from the restricted number again, and he's reporting that the naked Mexican man is at the basketball courts and is hanging from the hoop. He also described that he has a \"big john\" and I heard a brief chuckle then he hung up.\n\nI figured one of the tenant's was prank calling myself and my supervisor, so I didn't rush over to the basketball courts. However, my supervisor calls me back and notifies me that the man is armed and to proceed with caution. He also told me that the local PD was on route.\n\nSo naturally, I'm like oh shit he's armed, so I start hauling ass to the basketball courts on foot. My supervisor said to stay on the phone with him in case anything happened to me.\n\nI'm just about at the basketball courts and my supervisor asked me if I had drawn my firearm. I told him yes, and he said \"good cause he's armed with a massive cock\".\n\nAnd I'm like what? And he replied, \"Yeah he's armed with big hairy johnson.\" and then he began to laugh hysterically and just said \"Hahaha I'm just fucking with you\".\n\nInitially I was relieved. Then when I got back to the office, I had to calm down cause literally all my adrenaline dumped when I heard the word \"armed\" and then I thought about how bad of a prank that was. Luckily, none of the tenants saw me running full force with my gun at the ready.\n\nI'm not really upset or anything, I was just annoyed at the complexity of his prank and how much time and effort it wasted on my end.\n\nTL;DR: My supervisor pranked me by pretending to be a tenant and calling in about a naked man on the property. He would then call me from his number to notify me the individual is armed and dangerous. As I rushed over, he informed me the man is armed with a massive cock and that he was just pranking me.",

        "text": "This happened a while ago, the people I work with just reminded me about it today.\n\nI work as a security guard at a loan office located in a shopping plaza: theres an indoor swap meet, McDonalds, Subway and various other things near by so usually before or after work (I bring my own lunch, so I usually don't go there during my breaks) I might go to one and get something to drink or to eat.\n\nSince it's a populated shopping square and it's located on the bad side of town there's a few security guards from different companies; I'm at the financial office, one patrolling the entire plaza, one at the grocery store, and a few more. \nOn this particular day I decided to get my signature subway sandwich, as soon as the lady making the sandwich looks up and sees my uniform she immediately screams \n&gt; \"WHERE WERE YOU? WE JUST GOT ROBBED AND YOU'RE OVER HERE ORDERING A SANDWICH. ARENT YOU SUPPOSE TO BE PROTECTING THIS ENTIRE CENTER\"\n\n&gt;Me: uhhh, I'm sorry but I'm the security guard at the loan office a few doors down, did you happen to see who robbed the store?\n\n&gt;\"We'll not really, because I had my head down, but they took two sandwiches without paying! I went to the back to get something and he took them and left, YOU SHOULDVE BEEN ABLE PREVENTED THIS\"\n\n&gt;Lady goes on to complain about how security guards don't do anything, they're lazy, why are we paying them, ect.\n\nAt this point I just walked out and told her if she has any issues regarding the security guards patrolling the center and their effectiveness she can contact their company. I just wanted a sandwich but ended up getting a few tacos :^(.\n\nSorry for my bad formatting this is the first time I've ever posted anything on Reddit",

        "text": "Cross-posted to /securityguards. I posted it this here as per recommendation.\n\nI have a rather annoying/cool knack for running into security scenarios while off duty. I'll be at the gym and someone faints or starts showing signs of a heart attack. Or there's a jerk at the restaurant bathroom and the manager thinks that blocking the jerk's exit when the jerk's twice his size and likely had a needle.\n\nProbably one of the most unusual times was on my day off and I am at the subway. I'm sure you've noticed that since you started the job you never look at a crowd in the same way, so I spot a guy in the corner wearing no shoes and covering his eyes and edging towards the edge of the platform. I figure he's a jumper and think that I'll be damned if I do nothing, and so I send an awesome lady upstairs to call and wait for the police, and then approach him.\n\nI keep my distance at first and talk to him, giving my name, asking his, and trying to find out what's wrong and doing my best to convince him not to jump. Turns out he wasn't there to jump at all, from what I could make if his muttering he thinks it's the Apocalypse if he looks around, he'll see demons and Hellfire and was just wandering blindly around. Okay then, I think and very carefully grab the bottom of his shirt, leaning away because I don't want to end up on the Track of Death and guide him away.\n\nThis goes pretty well for a while. I continually tell him he's safe and where he really is. Suddenly things get complicated again. He finally looks around and realises that the Apocalypse has been cancelled alla Pacific Rim and starts sprinting away with a manic glee and whooping for joy. Pretty soon he's out on the street and running through downtown traffic. I run into the awesome lady again and without missing a beat she hands me her cellphone so I can keep in contact with the dispatcher while she waits there in case the police show up. Thankfully I work downtown so I can give her directions quite accurately. At this point I've picked up an entourage of good Samaritans who are trying to make sure cars don't hit the mentally ill guy. Of course since this is my day off, I had felt like girling myself up and am wearing completely impractical shoes and a dress.\n\nSo picture this, you are stuck in afternoon traffic, and you notice a guy with a smile to make the Joker jealous dashing through traffic, shortly followed by a small army of people in business attire frantically waving their purses and suitcases at you and apparently being chased by a woman in heels who's dress and speed is causing her to moon everyone behind her. What would you be thinking?\n\nAlas, the ending of this was pretty unremarkable. Eventually the police arrived , pounced on him because he was about to run in front of a car and restrained him until an ambulance could arrive.\n\nThat's my weirdest off duty story. What sort of thing have you dealt with?",

It is out of order, as indicated by the out of order sign taped to the door and trashcan blocking the door. I have to explain this to people at least 30 times a day.\n\n###Cast\n\nMe: Security Guy\n\nH: Husband of the star of this story. He's a middle aged African man with the patience of a saint, but he also pissed me off\n\nLady : Fucking batshit crazy white trashy lady\n\n###Story\n\n*H and L walk in. L is drinking a ginger ale.*\n\n&gt;Me: You can't drink in here.\n\n&gt;L: Oh I'm sorry\n\n*L chugs entire soda*\n\n***45 minutes later***\n\nI'm ~~browsing Reddit with the passion of 1000 suns~~ working hard when H walks up to me. I watch him look at the trash can, then the door, then the sign, then me. I know what's coming next, and I prepare myself for it.\n\n&gt;H: Hey, do you guys have a restroom ?\n\n&gt;Me: Not a working one, I'm sorry.\n\n&gt;H(pointing at bathroom door): Is that one out of order ?\n\nAt this point I turn and stare at the sign for a few seconds, pretending to read it for the first time.\n\n&gt;Me: Gosh, it is.\n\n&gt;H: Well can she use it ? (gestures to Lady)\n\n&gt;Me: Well no, because it doesn't work. That's why we put the sign on the door. \n\nH asks where there is another bathroom. I give him directions to a nearby business​ that will allow L to use the restroom. He goes back to sit next to L.\n\n***10 Minutes Later***\n\n*L walks up to me, waddling.*\n\n&gt;L: Can I please just use your bathroom ? I have a medical condition and you made me drink that whole soda before I came in and now I can't hold it.\n\n*I turn and pretend to read the sign*\n\n&gt;Me: Unfortunately, I believe the restroom is out of order.\n\n&gt;L: But I can't hold it.\n\n&gt;Me: Oh. Okay. \n\n&gt;L: I don't see why I can't-\n\n&gt;Me: Because the toilet doesn't work. If you flush it, it regurgitates the contents and noone here wants to deal with that.\n\nL stands in front of my desk for a few minutes, as if her presence will make me budge. I don't care because all she's doing is wasting time that she could be using to walk to another restroom ( the place I directed H to is literally connected to our building. Maybe a 1-2 minute walk.)\n\n&gt;L:What if I go piss on your sidewalk ? \n\n&gt;Me: Well, It's not *our* sidewalk, and I probably wouldn't care. I wouldn't suggest it, but that's your choice.\n\n(sidenote: a different security company patrols the parking lot and they don't take any shit. I was setting her up for failure.) \n\n&gt;L:DON'T CALL MY BLUFF. I'LL PISS ON THE SIDEWALK. \n\n&gt;Me: That's personal mam.\n\n&gt;L(now shouting): I'm not supposed to drink soda and YOU MADE ME DRINK A WHOLE SODA BEFORE I CAME IN. THIS IS ON YOU !!!!\n\n&gt;Me: Mam, you had that soda when you got-\n\n&gt;L:I DON'T CARE. FIRST YOU MAKE ME DRINK THE SODA, NOW YOU MAKE ME PISS OUTSIDE. WHAT IF I WAS YOUR GRANDMOTHER ?\n\n&gt;Me: . . . . Mam the restroom is out of ord-\n\n&gt;L: FINE !\n\nAt this point, this crazy bitch walks outside. Her husband, who was sitting across the room, says half-heartedly \"*Just go next door to the bathroom*\", but it was faaaaaarrrrrrr too late for reason.\n\nWe have huge windows and she stands right in front of one. She pulls her sweatpants down to her ankles, presses her pasty white ass against the dirty outside window, and pisses right there against the wall/window. The entire waiting room watched it happen. Some people laughed, most just gasped in complete shock. I, from working with the public for almost 5 years, am almost unfazed and just go in the back to inform my supervisor that 1)I'm not letting L back in and 2) We need housekeeping. \n\nWhen I get back to the lobby, I see that a guard from the other company has now arrived. To make a long story a little shorter, the lady had to wait outside until her documents were ready and has been effectively banned from the property. \n\nThe worst part is, this isn't the only one. . . .\n\n-----",

I stand to go see what the smell is, walking past our numerous \"NO FOOD OR DRINK\" signs. I spot a kid sitting down and eating a sausage biscuit. I walk over to tell his chaperone that he can't eat in the lobby, but if he doesn't make a mess I'll let him eat at my desk (I have a weakness for kids, sue me). \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me( tapping woman's shoulder): mam.  .  .  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe woman turns around and at this moment I notice that the syrup smell is now very strong. I look down and notice that she's holding an entire breakfast platter. I'm talking pancakes, eggs, sausage, and syrup poured all over everything. Seriously, she had to have a bottle hidden somewhere. It was more like a syrup platter with pancakes on the side.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: Mam you can't eat in here.\n\n\n&gt;Pancake:( With mouth full of food and more food on her fork) I ain't eatin' !\n\n\n&gt;Me: Well, ummm, what are you doing ?\n\n\n&gt;Pancake(very matter of a factly) : Having my breakfast.\n\n\n\n\nNow this is the moment where I begin to question how much I need this job. Every fiber of my being is telling me to snatch the platter out of her hand and rub her beloved syrup in her face. But, I just *had* to have unprotected sex and create a little person, so living on ramen isn't an option. I suck it up and try again.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: Well mam, I think that counts as eating.\n\n\n&gt;Pancake: No. It doesn't. This is breakfast, not food.\n\n\n&gt;Me: Well it seems like your eating to me so I'm going to have to ask you to stop.\n\n\n&gt;Pancake: I'm sorry honey, I'll put it away.\n\n\n\n\n\nI walk away, hoping that she would keep the food away. Boy finished his biscuit during the debacle, so my sympathy for the situation is gone. \n\n\n\n\nI'm back at my desk for a few minutes when I notice something weird. Boy is now sitting alone. \n\n\n\n\n*ohmyfuckinggodwhereisthissyrupeatingbitchnow* \n\n\n\n\nI stand to \"investigate\" when I notice that a usually unused service \"window\"(like the windows at MVA) is occupied by someone whose legs I can see. My experience dealing with asshats tells me exactly what's happening here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI walk up to the window and stand behind the person there, waiting for them to turn around. I waiting about 29 seconds. It was worth it. I had to see her face when she was caught. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPancake catches a glimpse​ of my reflection in the window. She turns around so fast that she almost dropped her fork and glared at me with intense anger. Let me mention that there is syrup and butter all over her face. This lady is at least 45 years old, btw.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: Mam-\n\n&gt;Pancake: ITS NOT EVEN FUCKING FOOD. IT'S PANCAKES ! GET A FUCKING LIFE !\n\n&gt;Me: Mam you aren't allowed to eat here. If you continue, I'm going to have to ask-\n\n&gt;Pancake: FUCK YOU IM LEAVING ! \n\n\nSo Pancake and Boy leave, without the documents that Pancake had paid for. I'm not sure why she *had* to eat the pancakes at that moment, but it sure was funny.",

Most of the time, I am sat in front of our entrance behind a couple of monitors watching our CCTV cameras in store. \n\nCustomers come and talk to me on a regular basis, normally asking me where the baskets are or if they can have a £1 coin for trolleys (shopping cart for my US counterparts), to which my answers are \"right over there\" and \"no\" respectively.\n\nAnyway, I digress. The point is people talk to me whether I want them to or not. The following is one of those conversations.\n\nI am sat behind my monitors doing my thing when a man comes and stands next to me. And when I say next to me I can feel his breath on my arm.\n\nI look at him and he is just staring at me. A few awkward moments pass and I ask him what he wants.\n\nFull of concentration like a kung fu master in deep meditatiin, the man prepared to speak. Seconds ticked by as if in slow motion. This must be important. \n\nI prepared myself.\n\nThe man lifted his arm and pointed towards the door...\n\n\"BREAST!!!\" he shouted at the top of his voice. I looked at him bewildered.\n\n\"BREAST!!!\" he exclaimed again pointing with more vigour towards the door. \n\nI noticed a strong foreign accent this time. English must be a new language for him. Perhaps this man is saying something else to what I'm thinking because surely there would be no reason to shout breast to a security guard.\n\n\"I'm sorry sir, I don't understand\" I reply hoping he understands.\n\nAlas, the man does not. He looks at me again.\n\n\"No no no, BREAST\" he points yet again.\n\nThis time he walks over to the door. He bends down by a stack of products and returns. He places a bra down on my podium and smiles. He explained...\n\n\"Breast\"\n\n\"Oh...thank you\" I say with a smile. The man with pride in his eyes waved good bye and left the store.\n\n\nTl:dr Foreign customer helps security recover a stray bra by saying the word breast over and over.",

So our gate guard calls 911 to get an ambulance on the way and our EMT, patrol supervisor, site captain and beach patrol officer respond to the home. Upon arrival (approximately 2 minutes) our EMT does an evaluation and noticed the patient having a massive stroke. They start patient care and radio the gate to update fire-rescue with the new information by calling back 911. \n\nThe gate guard says no it's ok they just pulled into property. NO! Fire-rescue takes about 7 minutes to show up at our front gate and an additional 4ish to make it to the person's home, an additional few minutes to do an assessment and call for addtional units. So by this time the person has been stroking out for 15 to 20 minutes. But because the ambulance is a two man crew they need to wait an additonal 5 to 10 minutes for more man power before they can get under way to a hospital. Not good when your having a stroke. \n\nBy the guard ignoring the order from the on site EMT,  patient care was delayed by upwards of 10 minutes. Moral of the story is gate guards when the patrol says hey do this, do it. Your not on scene you don't get to make judgement calls. Do as your ordered, people's lives may depend on it. ",

        "text": "I recently discovered this sub, and I thought this would fit here. So, I used to work in the security department for a local amusement park. Some background: My particular job was to check guests and their bags for any banned or dangerous items before they enter the park. There are multiple signs from the parking lot to the entranceway explaining what is and is not permitted, and another sign that hangs behind my head. The entrance has three parts: the part where you purchase the tickets (if you didn't buy them online), my part (usually comprised of two workers to make lines quicker), and the part where your ticket gets scanned for entry (manned by \"gatekeepers\"). \n\nI'm working, it's my first week and most people are nice and respectful. There's the occasional grumpy guest but it usually doesn't amount to much. Enter Coffee Lady. Coffee Lady (CL) is your typical suburban mom, the type who always has a cup of coffee in hand and frequently asks to speak to a manager. As she enters, she goes towards the side my coworker (CW) is on. He sees her cup of coffee, which falls into a category of items not allowed into the park, as seen on the multitude of signs I mentioned before. \n\nCW: I'm sorry, ma'am, but I can't allow your beverage into the park. If you'd like, you can either finish it here or throw it away.\n\nCL: But I just bought this. You're just trying to force me to spend money on your outrageously priced park food. \n\nCW: I'm sorry, but it's clearly stated on the signs that we do not permit outside beverages in the park. \n\nCoffee Lady is getting quite annoyed at the prospect of not being given special permission to bring her coffee into the park. She turns to the gatekeeper (GK) behind us, who has nothing to do with whether she can bring her coffee into the park, but everything to do with whether she is allowed into the park or not. \n\nCL (to GK): Do you hear what he's telling me? He says I can't bring my coffee in. Can't you just let me in?\n\nGK: No, ma'am, he's correct. You can't bring the coffee inside the park.\n\nCL (now fuming): This. Is. RIDICULOUS.\n\nGK: Ma'am, I think you're the one being ridiculous right now.\n\nThis is the last straw for Coffee Lady. She removes the lid as if she's intending to dump it into the nearby trash can. This was not at all what she did, however. Instead, she turned to my coworker and poured the entire cup onto his shoes. I don't know what she thought this would achieve, though, because it definitely didn't get her into the park that day. She was by far one of my worst encounters with a guest, and thankfully I wasn't the one that was given a coffee shower that day.",

        "text": "As a part of my job, I have to go to an apartment complex to ensure there's no loitering or structural damage and such. Some questionable people live there.\n\nOne night, when I arrive, there's an elderly couple standing outside. They approached me and explained that their son, a resident who has been struggling with drugs, had called them and told them that he was going to end it. He was depressed and wanted to kill himself.\n\nThey were unable to make contact with their son and complained that they'd called 911 but had not been taken seriously. I immediately called, and as a security guard, I get taken more seriously (ask me all you want, I can't explain why they weren't taken seriously from the start, maybe there was a history of false alarms).\n\nI take them to the outside of the apartment their son lived in, but I only have the key to the front doors, I can't get in to the individual apartments. By this time, emergency dispatches are starting to show up. Ambulance, police and fire department. If you need to break into a place legally, the fire department are the experts. My boss also shows up, he can't do much more than me, but in principle he needs to attend in such a crisis.\n\nThen the elderly couple receives a call. It's from their neighbors in the next town over, having just seen their son knock on their door (loudly, might I add)! Now, police, ambulance, fire department and my boss have all arrived at this apartment complex, at my request, and the suicidal son wasn't even there!\n\nSo while the parents were rushing to the apartment complex to support their son, he had gotten in his car and driven to their house, next town over. Now, I have a lot to do, so when it became apparent that we weren't going to find a corpse, my boss told me to continue with my next task, and I got in my car and drove off, leaving him to deal with emergency dispatches.\n\nMy next task was going back to base and eat a sandwich.\n\nEpilogue: Everyone and their grandmother agreed that I had done the right thing with the knowledge I had. The HR guy at my company had a chat with me, to ensure I hadn't received any psychological damage from not finding a corpse. My boss conveyed thanks from the elderly couple, who appreciated that I had taken them seriously.\n\nThe suicidal son, once he realized his parents were at his place, had gotten back into his car and crashed it on his way back (he was drunk and high, but he survived).",

        "text": "Long time lurker, first time poster. The following is one of the most surreal on the job experiences of my life.\n\nFirst allow me to bring everyone up to speed, I've been doing security in down town Vancouver and the surrounding area for 4 years, never thought I'd be into it till I tried but I found the field fascinating.\n\nIn that time I have worked everywhere from the nicest neighborhoods, to the seediest drug infested ghettos. I've worked in film and television, concerts, festivals, doorman at clubs, and pretty much every mall, construction site and piss soaked car park the city has to offer. I've been locked in a vault at an Apple store because thieves were using a concrete saw to cut their way in from the parkade. I've walked all over hells half acre, I've stood in one spot for 12 straight hours, I've even worked a Sikh wedding or two, wonderful people, love the Sikhs.\n\nI thought I had seen everything, I wasn't prepared for this.\n\nAs of last November I have been working graveyard shifts at a Marina under the Burrard Street Bridge down town, 15 minutes on the bus to get to work, the people are cool, gorgeous scenery, and most importantly, nothing ever fucking happens. The crack whores and speed freaks have been replaced by herons and otters. I haven't had to tell someone to stop doing heroin for months. I fucking love it here.\n\nSo about 1 in the morning I'm finishing up my regularly scheduled patrol, talking to a friend of mine who owns a boat down there, and as we're coming through the security gate I hear the strangest noise just a few feet away. So I reach for my trusty light saber, and a little ways off in the distance I see this blob about the size of a raccoon over by this bunch of trees that are next to the parking lot. Some things up, raccoons don't make that kinda noise, then one of the fucking trees falls over....it's a mother fucking beaver.\n\nSo me and buddy flip our shit cause neither one of us had seen one before, let alone this close. Maybe it was because I can go days on end without seeing another living soul or maybe it was because we just burned one out behind the BMX park, but this blew my ever loving mind.\n\nThat's when I realize buddy isn't walking too great, and he's kinda having trouble dragging this tiny assed branch around.\n\nMy security senses are tingling.\n\nWhat's a fuckin beaver doing in a parking lot in the middle of down town? How many beavers down town could there be? I've never heard of any. Like, Is this some sort of special famous beaver or some shit? Don't these things live in groups? Can't these things drag big assed trees around? Why is it trying to make a feeble attempt to build a dam under the docks in the middle of the night? What's it doing in salt water in the first place, aren't these things fresh water mammals? Aren't these things supposed to be endangered?\n\nI haven't thought about beavers for more than 2 seconds since I flunked the test on em back in grade 4. Alls I know is the thing on the fuckin nickel is in trouble. The last thing I need to happen is I lose my job and if some fuckin famous beaver dies on my watch I'm fucked. The mental image of one of my awful Facebook photos plastered on the front page of some newspaper with the headline \"Local oaf ruins Canada\" flashed before my eyes. I normally have a plan for everything but this is virgin territory, what the fuck am I going to do, don't fuck this up.\n\nSo I did what anyone would do, I called my fuckin supervisor.\n\nOnce he finished laughing, he realized the serious nature of the situation and that I wasn't joking. Plus now that I had called him, the blood of this beaver would be on his hands as well if we didn't do something. He'd never heard of any down town beavers, he didn't have answers to any of my questions or know what the fuck to do either, other than to call animal control. Which I figured was my next move anyway.\n\nWell they're closed from 10pm till 7am, great, but the answering machine said if it was a serious situation to call 911. Well this isn't some grizzly bear attack, shit ain't THAT serious, but it's still a situation. A potentially famous, possibly endangered down town beaver arrived on my door step all jacked up, what's the play here? So fuck it, I'll call the VPD Non Emergency line. The automatic system didn't have a sick beaver option so I waited for what felt like forever for the operator.\n\nOnce she stopped laughing, she confirmed that yes, they are protected, no he isn't supposed to be there, if he stays here he's gonna get hurt even more, and that yes this was in fact a serious situation. Animal Control was going to be contacted ASAP so they can bring in, and I shit you not, a \"Beaver Relocation Specialist\".....because of course that's a thing. Fuckin Canada. \n\nThis happened last night, I saw him alive as of 0400 this morning. I had a meeting at 1545 this afternoon, alls I know is that the proper authorities have been called, I'll update with more information. Site secure, nothing further to report. ",

Nowadays I'm normally bar backing to train for bar tending but I used to work the floor pretty much every night. \n\nThursday's are our busiest nights due to specials on pitchers of mixed drinks, which usually leads to a lot of overly drunk college kids that don't know their limit. As you can imagine this tends to get a bit rowdy, which makes the night a little more exciting. One night was particularly interesting.\n\nI was cleaning the main bar (we have a building with a bar in the basement, main bar first floor, and a more club styled bar upstairs) one night early since people tend to be out of there sooner. Two of my coworkers come down the stairs \"escorting\" a pair of guys. There's a bit of yelling so I walk over to see what's going on. As I walk over, my buddy turns and says that one of the drunk guys is refusing to leave and wants to be \"take out like a real man.\" Now I'm not a big guy by any means but I have 11 years martial arts experience and 4 years of MMA so I'm pretty confident when it comes to a fight. I smile at the drunk guy and said \"we could arrange that,\" mostly in an attempt to get him to leave without incident.\n\nArgument continues for a short while and we're now in the doorway which is like two separate doors with a short entryway between, the drunk kid is standing here with his friend behind him, we're between them and the bar. Eventually, my buddy turns to me and says, \"Hey you know what would be funnier than throwing him out? If we just called the cops.\" He pulled his phone out at the same time and this seemed to get a reaction out of the drunk. The kid then decided to try and be all cool (then again I guess he'd been doing it all along) and went to shake my coworkers hand saying, \"nah it's okay I just now you guys are a bunch of pu**ys.\" As my coworker went to shake his hand so he would leave, the kid decided to take a swing at my buddy's head. He ducked out of the way and I instinctively gave him a solid overhead right to the chin. He was lucky he didn't get a broken jaw. As he hit the ground his buddy tried to step in but I kicked him square in the chest and out the door. Grabbed his drunk idiot friend by the collar and dragged him out onto the sidewalk. Before I went back inside I asked if he felt like a man yet. Can honestly say that was one of the most satisfying experiences I've had working there. Especially since I got a good tip out that night.\n\nTLDR: if you're drunk, don't ask to be taken out like a real man by bouncers, cause you will be",

        "text": "I worked for a company that provides patrol services in Portland, Oregon. Since I've recently left that company I've decided to share some stories from my time working there. In between responding to calls for service, we would provide \"lockup\" services for clients. That means we would show up and lock the offices, gates, pools, or whatever they wanted locked.\n\nAs I was performing a lockup for one of our apartment complexes I received a call from dispatch in regards to a noise complaint at the same property I was at. I make my way over that way and I can immediately tell its a party. \n\nI approach the apartment and knock on the door. The door cracks open and the owner comes outside, trying to leave as much of the door closed as possible. I'm decently tall at about 6'3\" and this guy had to be like 5'8\" so I could see over his head and into the apartment. I could see what looked like alot of underage kids, alcohol bottles on the table, and I could see the lingering smoke from the metric shit ton of marijuana that was being consumed. \n\nWith the door closed and the guy in private, I informed him why I was there. I told him what I saw inside. His face immediately turned white. I told him that I would leave what I saw out of my report, but he has to keep that under control because if I have to come back and he breaks my offer, I will be returning with the police. He thanks me a ton. I get his ID and note down the details for my report. \n\nI cleared the call and departed to another property which was just up the road. Right as I'm pulling onto the other property, my vehicle radio goes off. Apparently this kid decided he wanted to void my offer. \n\nI return to the property and exit my patrol vehicle. As I'm going to make my approach to the apartment, I see PD pull up and park behind me. The officer hopped out of his car and waved me over.\n\n&gt;Officer: Here for the noise complaint too?\n\n&gt;Me: Yessir. I was just here about 10 minutes ago. I tried to give the guy a warning but I guess that didn't work. \n\n&gt;Officer: Well, do you have it under control? I have calls pending. \n\n&gt;Me: Yeah, I do. Want the information of the guy I spoke with earlier? \n\n*I gave the officer the information and he departed the area*\n\nI go back to the apartment and knock. I'm greeted again by the same guy. His face goes white again and he steps outside, bringing with him a small cloud of marijuana smoke. \n\n&gt;Me: Look man, I tried to be cool about it. I get it, its a Friday night and you want to party. I'd rather be out with my buddies too but you gotta be courteous to your neighbors. This is now my second time here due to this party. I'm going to be writing a formal report to your management about what I've seen, what you've told me, and your disregard for rules set by your landlord. You're very lucky it's me and not the police here or else you'd probably be getting cited right now. If I have to come back here, I'm bringing PD with me. Are we clear?\n\nHe understood and went back inside. I could tell that he knew he was fucked. The marijuana use in his apartment could lead to him being evicted due to the zero tolerance policy. \n\nAs I was walking back to my car I could hear the music turn down. Once I got in my car I could see somebody peeking out of the blinds. I drove around to the back of the building and got back out on foot. I walked to the rear of the building and the music was louder than when I showed up for the first call. They were waiting to watch me leave before they turned up the music again. \n\nI returned my patrol vehicle and contacted non-emergency. I gave the dispatcher a rundown of the situation and the name of the officer I spoke with earlier. I waited about 15 minutes when I see 3 PD cruisers come creeping into the apartment complex. They had brought four officers. The guy I spoke with earlier approached me;\n\n&gt;Officer: Alright so, we cleared our shit and we've got all night. Officer 1 and his trainee are going to go watch the back doors to make sure no one leaves that way. Myself, Officer 2, and you will go the front doors. We're going to ID everyone and shut this party down.\n\n&gt;Me: Sounds good to me. \n\nWe all get into position and the main officer and I go to the door. He knocks, the music turns down, the door opens and the same dude opens the door and immediately has a priceless look of defeat on his face. \n\n&gt;Officer: So, this is the third time someone has been called out here due to your party. The security officer has given you two warning and even offered to sweep the situation under the rug. I want the ID's of everyone here to ensure that all guests are of age. \n\nIn the end, the four officers issued 17 MIP's for alcohol, cited the main guy for MIP of marijuana since no one else would confess to ownership for it, and they even slapped him with a noise ordnance fine of like $500. I issued 4 trespass citations to party-goers who were disrespectful to the police. The icing on the cake is that it turns out one of the guests had been trespassed from the property about 3 years before. He was arrested for criminal trespass and taken to jail. \n\nThe only downside is that I had to stay late after work writing the long ass report but booooi it was worth it. ",

I was in a very affluent area called Lake Oswego performing a property patrol of one of the many apartment complexes there. Well this specific apartment has a pool house that they like us to lock up after 1am. \n\nIt was about 12:45 so I decided to lock it up early since I was leaving the area after this patrol. I go inside and sweep the pool house. It looks like it does every day. Nothing particularly out of the ordinary. I had always gotten creepy vibes inside of that pool house though. I never felt as if I was alone and I'd always encounter cold spots. My supervisor reported having the same issue on several occasions. Anyhow, everything looks business as usual. There is no water outside of the tub, no spare towels left lying around, the chairs and tables are all in order. I go check the side door and find it secured. \n\nI go back to secure the main door and as I'm doing so I hear the water move. I then heard two quick foot steps (like wet socks squish when you walk in them), and felt something tap my shoulder. \n\nI jumped and turned around, with the crap scared out of me because I thought I was alone, and there was nobody there. All I saw were two fresh prints of bare feet on the concrete floor. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3eWd9FO.jpg\n\nThroughout the following months I told my story to residents and showed them the pictures. I had a few that reported similar instances of things happening to them. One resident said that on one occasion he was drying off after getting out of the hot tub on a late night. He was alone in the poolhouse when suddenly there was a huge splash in the pool as if somebody had just jumped in the pool. But he was alone and had no idea what caused it. \n\nI never personally had any issues after that besides the feeling of being watched and cold spots in the pool house. Definitely one of the spookiest things to ever happen to me. \n",

        "text": "I worked for a company that provides patrol services in Portland, Oregon. Since I've recently left that company I've decided to share some stories from my time working there. In between responding to calls for service, we would provide \"lockup\" services for clients. That means we would show up and lock the offices, gates, pools, or whatever they wanted locked. \n\nI was southeast of Portland in a city called Milwaukee. I was at a property conducting my routine lockup of the pool area at an apartment complex when I was approached by a man who asked for help. Our conversation went something like this;\n\n&gt;Him: Excuse me, officer, can you help me?\n\n&gt;Me: Yeah, whats up man?\n\n&gt;Him: So I need you to listen to me... I know this is going to sound really far fetched but I just found out this was happening. My daughter is locked in the leasing office right now, and both maintenance men are railing her the fuck out.\n\n&gt;Me: Uhhh.... alright. I just came from there. There was nobody inside the building. \n\n&gt;Him: Alright, let me let you in on a little secret. I have implants in my eyes that let me see like the monster from the movie predator. I can see their heatwaves inside the building and if you're not going to help me, I'm going in there myself. \n\nIt was at this point that I got on the radio and requested that dispatch call non-emergency because this dude was obviously fucking crazy. \n\n&gt;Me: Well sir, I'd love to help you investigate but before I do that, can I see your ID so I know where to find you if we get split up?\n\n&gt;Him: Great idea man! *He proceeds to give me his ID*\n\nAs I take his ID and I'm noting down his information, about 3-4 cars from Milwaukee PD come creeping into the apartment complex. Three of the officers encircle him while one pulls me aside for info.\n\n&gt;Officer: Have you ID'd him yet? *I offer the cop the crazy dude's drivers license*\n\n&gt;Me: I was just beginning to note down his info when you guys showed up. \n\n&gt;Officer: Yeah, we deal with this guy every week. Last week we caught him swimming through the pond naked and screaming Nevaeh, you know like Heaven but spelled backwards. \n\n&gt;Me: And who is....?\n\n&gt;Officer: It's his daughter that he claims to exist but none of us have ever seen her. \n\nAt this point we direct our attention back to the crazy dude and he's rambling on about how he doesn't do meth anymore when he stops talking and begins staring at the doorway to the leasing office. All of us out of curiosity, wonder what the hell he's looking at. \n\n&gt;Officer: [Crazy dudes name], what are you looking at?\n\n&gt;Him: There she is, she just walked out of the building. \n\nAll of us looking and see nothing there and look back at him confused. \n\n&gt;Him: Alright, let me let you guys in on a little secret. My family has connections to the CIA and my daughter has one of the few invisibility cloaks. I can only see her because of my predator implants. \n\nAt this point, he said they were going home now and he just started walking. Once he left the property line I stopped following him but the cops continued to follow. No clue what happened to him after that. ",

        "text": "Last week I shared [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/642w0h/this_lunatic_battle_over_the_fate_of_my_employment/) and it's finally reached a conclusion. \n\nSince the beginning, I was forwarding everything I was being told by Security Manager and Security HR to each other and they were doing their best to ignore it. However, a fuse was lit when Company B HR started asking me direct questions about future work. \n\nWe were in the middle of finalizing a lot of involved projects that had been on hold for months, since Frank wasn't skilled enough to do them, and losing me would mean throwing away all that work. \n\nWhen I told them that I didn't know, that this may be my last week and that Frank might be coming back, the HR person I work with sent a few emails. One that included the VP. And people were **mad**. It seems that Frank was so hated that our Security Manager had to promise that he would \"never set foot in the building ever again\". \n\nFear that he was returning caused some very unhappy emails to my company, asking why in gods name Company B was paying them in the first place if they couldn't staff proper guards. Blissfully unaware that upper management on all sides had been screaming at each other, I finally get notified that;  \n\nFrank will not be coming back and that he is to be moved to another account, Security HR is forever banned from talking to the client or my post ever again, and the job is pretty much mine because Company B loves my work, but there is one person who needs to interview for the position before its final (I was just covering for a vacation at first after all). \n\nThat was yesterday afternoon. The interview came and went but by this point I had a huge bias in my favor. This morning I was told that B went with me. So huzzah! I can finally breathe a little easier now that all the stress is over and actually get some real work done. \n\nSecurity Manager and I had a long talk over why our HR was being so crazy. The best I can guess; its because Company A has had four guards quit in the last month. A is our biggest (but still failing) account, they cant afford to lose competent guards. So even though they were responsible for putting me here initially, they were trying to sabotage it too. \n\nI've dealt with that \"You're too skilled to be promoted\" shit before, so I am very glad the better side won out in the end. Its an especially pleasing level of schadenfreude that my HR got burned so badly over this. If you dont want this kind of problem, don't hire unskilled guards and treat your skilled ones better. \n\n",

        "text": "It seems like some of you found my last post somewhat interesting, so I will post my favourite, and then you can all downvote my other stories into oblivion. \n\n---\n\nA large corporation decided to build a fancy new building the old part of town, right where the homeless issue is most prevalent. The new building was smack dab in the middle between two of the largest missions and thus homeless service centers in the city. Right between the main road for people who wander from one to the other. \n\nEven money doesn't make anything perfect and their fire alarms had been acting up for the last few weeks. At least 4 or 5 times the alarm would go off, everyone would have to vacate and do a standard fire procedure. Happily not my problem. We happened to operate the park next to the new building, so naturally we tended to congeal there. \n\nThe fire alarm was going off again, the fire department was arriving and the wide-eyed workers exited the building and crossed the street to the public space across the way. About 100 people are standing in the urban park where a fair amount of the homeless people hangout between feeds. Nothing out of the ordinary. Yet.\n\nWhile talking to the park concierge I hear some yelling. I poke my head around the Information booth my coworker is occupying and see a woman, slightly overweight, clearly on drugs and screaming her heart out about whatever is on her mind. Oh and she is in just a scarf, a bra and yoga pants in the middle of fall. She is walking up the promenade towards the crowd. *Oh boy, here we go* I get the attention of my coworker to the impending hilarity (or tragedy.)\n\nI watch heads turn of concerned workers. They are used to a commercial park in the suburbs, but the big city is seriously wearing on them. I sit perched on my bicycle a big shit-eating grin on my face, barely containing a full round of laughter. Slowly the burble of small talk fades as the shouting of the woman takes priority. Building security gets the nod from the FD and begin to let people into the building. She crosses the street, looking for an audience for her DVD debut.\n\nThe panicked faces of uninitiated office workers begins to split apart, forming a solid 20 foot circle around her. People literally running into the park, while people nearly on the verge of trampling each other, flood into the 2 double doors. \n\nShe sashays into the park, the crowd dispersing as stands up on an under equipped table who reluctantly took her weight as she begins acting out a scene from Coyote Ugly. At this point, the door side of the crowd has made it to safety and the park side of people are making a dash to \"safety\" into the building. \n\nI am dying of laughter, my coworker too, is losing her grip on it. But eventually responsibility takes over, she needs to get her off the table. As we are making our way over there it becomes a Girls Gone Wild special. She removes her yoga pants, revealing a clearly distressed and uncomfortable with the situation, pair of matching Victoria Secret panties. *At least they match. Can't unsee.* My coworker, being the good soul she is, tries to get her to put her pants on. That doesn't happen. She calls out to the transient regulars playing ping pong at the other end of the park. \"It's Girls Gone Wild isn't it boys?!\"\n\nThey turn, look. Stop. Stare. Cringe. Scream back, \"PUT YOUR FUCKING PANTS ON BITCH. DAMN. I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT.\" And return to their very competitive game of ping pong. The girl doesn't care. *She's gone wild. I mean, spring break will do that to you.*\n\nI realize I can't do anything, we are hands off, and we are more concerned about her mental state (and catching something) to do more than observe. I pull back and sit on my bike, as a bike cop rolls up. \"What... is going on here?\" He asks me. I turn blankly at him. \"Girls Gone Wild.\" He looks at me, scrunches his moustache and calls for backup on the radio. We sit there, and watch my bold coworker talk to her. She gives up, and walks back over to us. Backup arrives, and they roll over to her. She pulls her pants up, gets off the table, and sat on the pink chair who was unhappy to see more of her.\n\nWe roll over, and start talking to her. She just wants a cigarette. I get her one from the regulars. \"Anything to get her out of here.\" A passerby give her a jacket. She sits in her new digs with a cigarette. Finishes it, and walks off. \n\n*Oh great, another thing I can't unsee.*\n\nNever saw her again. ",

We primarily work with homeless and business owners and see a fair bit of insanity on the streets with a pretty big patrol area.\n\n---\n\nI am in the retail core when two homeless men start fighting. One man has a skateboard, and the other is trying to grab it from him. *Oh come on, crack him with it. That'll make the weekly report.* He snatches his board back from him and starts walking down the street. The other man starts trash talking as he walks the other direction up the avenue. Skaterboy makes it half way down the block before he has enough, drops his stuff and hurls a terribly aimed water bottle towards the other man. It sails way off course and straight towards a Starbucks window. *Oh come on, break the window. Give me something to do.* It bounces off, *Damn.* scaring the daylights out of the phone-zombie patrons inside and ends the discussion, everyone going on their merry way. Another unit rolls up next to me and we analyze his rather terrible arm, and the crazy mood everyone seems to be in, as it was one of the few sunny days we had in February. \n\nAs we are talking, a \"concerned citizen\" approaches us and gives us \"His version of the incident he just witnessed.\" He identifies himself as a member of the nearby neighbourhood council and begins rambling off for the next 10 minutes about how we as a society just let people do whatever they want, talks about going to an art museum \"with million dollar art pieces\" and this woman with a \"very aggressive cough\" that was disturbing his visit at the art museum. \"And no one did anything! So I went over to her and said 'Maam, you have a very aggressive cough. And I am disturbed, so must other people.' And NO ONE did anything, and she KEPT COUGHING!\" He ranted on in the verge of insanity about how people with \"swollen fingers and tattoos\" are a serious danger to this society. Before tipping his hat at us and walking off. The other unit and I make eye contact. *Also crazy.* I roll my eyes so hard I thought I might lose them. \n\n83: \"Are they all crazy today?\"\n\nDR: \"Yep, but I think I prefer the other kind of crazy. At least the bottle throwers shut up and leave.\"\n\n83: \"I am getting the hell out of here before anything else happens.\"\n\nDR: \"I am coming with you.\"\n\nWe fled the scene.\n\n^Edit: ^Formatting.",

        "text": "I work security at a large supermarket in the UK. Unlike a lot of the stories I read on here, I can't carry a weapon, use handcuffs or really even make arrests. In fact my store has a strict 'back off/run away' policy when it comes to anyone aggressive so this tale may not seem all that bad but I can tell you, it was the worst day I've ever had. \n\nFair warning: this is long but you'll understand why if you read on.\n\nI arrive early on a bright spring morning to open up the store for 6am. I do my checks and then unlock the doors. I smile and say good morning to the hand full of customers waiting as they enter store. \n\nThen I see a rough looking man (perhaps homeless) come in. Has a posh 'Downton Abbey' voice as he says hello back. But despite the well-spokenness and polite greeting there's something not quite right about him. He has a plaid shirt on and a face tattoo and has continued having a conversation with himself. He also has only 1 arm. Instead of continuing with my other jobs, I decide I need to follow him on our CCTV cameras.\n\nHe casually makes his way round store just looking at things, picking bits and bobs up and putting them back again. He is now in the clothing section trying on pairs of sunglasses and inspecting them in a mirror. \n\nIt's all a bit odd but he isn't doing anything wrong. The night manager (NM) walks past and I grab his attention. \n\n&gt; Me: Hey NM, just to let you know I'm watching a homeless guy on cameras at the minute, he's a little odd but he hasn't done anything so far\n\nI did this because NM likes to know what's going on. As soon as I said this though, his expression changed to one of alarm.\n\n&gt; NM: Let me see *said with a hint of 'oh crap'*\n\nI show him the guy on cameras still happily trying on sunglasses.\n\n&gt; NM: We need to get him out now, he was banned last night. He is bad news. Ill go up and get him to leave, keep me on camera\n\n&gt; Me: Sure thing\n\nOff NM goes to get the homeless guy (HG) out of the store. HG doesn't seem happy to be told to leave and is demanding that \"we get the Prince on the phone\" so he could complain to him directly. I later found out that the Prince he was after was Prince Charles (you know, the Queens eldest son).\n\nThen starts a long and gruling day dealing with HG which I will condense down into short bits.\n\n- HG continues to enter store and complains that we are setting a bad example to kids because the plants were wilting slightly\n\n- HG picks up plants and other items on sale outside and begins to move them into random areas\n\n- HG keeps moving large numbers of shopping trolleys from bay to bay outside the store\n\n- HG heads into the McDonald's franchise resturant in store and grabs hands full of straws, sugar, napkins etc and starts dropping them on the floor one by one as he is ushered outside\n\nAfter all these things happen more than once, we decide to call the police. They agree to dispatch an officer out to us.\n\nOne arrives 45 mins later and ushers the guy off our property and instructs him not to come back. We find out from him that he had heard from yesterday that HG had been chased around our car park by officers after doing the same sorts of things he was doing now and must have slept nearby. His passing comments were to ring back if HG came and bothered us again.\n\nAnd he did! Just 30 mins after he was ushered off and he started doing all of the things listed above plus some more.\n\n- HG finds a bunch of keys left outside and comes in store. He tells me about them and I say thanks and I'll take them to Customer Service. This doesn't please him and he says that he will keep hold of them and return them. After I Ask him again to give them to me, He throws them at me, narrowly missing my face and crashing into a display behind me.\n\n- HG finds a pen and informs me that he used to be in the army and knows of several ways to kill me with it. He then starts stabbing packs of compost with it before throwing it at me.\n\nWe now reach 12:30pm I have been dealing with this guy since 6am. I am pretty annoyed. After several calls to the police, they reluctantly say they will send another officer out. They arrive in a van, but there is something wrong. They are Police Community Support Officers (PCSO) which don't have the authority to make arrests or take people away.\n\nThey then proceed to follow HG around the car park trying to steer him away from our store, with little effect as he kept running past them and confronting me.\n\nThe PCSO's then have this idea to call an ambulance to come and look at him in order to get him sectioned and taken away. They arrive and start to talk with him. After 20 mins or so they let him go and he then carries on with his activities. Apparently, he was super charming with the paramedics and they concluded that he was in complete control of his actions and not crazy so they couldn't take him away.\n\nThe PCSO's then got called away on a job but said they would come back after they had finished which meant HG was free again to terrorise our store, which he did until I left at 2pm. I handed over to my colleagues and left with HG still causing all sorts of trouble. \n\nI was informed the next day that he stayed until 6pm when the police came and arrested him. Here ends the tale of my most stressful day as a security guard...so far.\n\nTL;DR: Well spoken homeless guy terrorises supermarket for nearly 24 hours and security can't do anything about it because of store rules",

        "text": "Hello all. I wanted to share this ongoing story because I'm sitting at my desk laughing bitterly at this mess I was put into. Honestly, its more an HR issue than a security one, but it is still for my security job. I'll aim for brevity but its a messy situation.\n\nFor the last six years I've worked contracted security for Company A, which is downsizing to everyone's agony. Client and Guards. They sold a lot of stuff to Company B, who moved into one of A's locations, where I worked, last January. They loved me and when they moved to their own building after the sale, I wanted to go with. \n\nI was told I couldnt, because another guard was on a waiting list for them already. This was August. By November I get called to interview to work for Company B. Seems that guard, Frank, is nearly 70 and has never once used a computer. Ever. The post at B requires a *lot* of computer. Something I do well. \n\nI'm told I have the job. Then I wait two months to be told I dont. Im told Security Manager of B held his ground and forcibly said no and not even our regional manager who interviewed me would overturn him. March arrives and HR calls me again. Frank is going on a long vacation and I'm taking his place. I'm promised that if I work really really hard they will keep me instead of him. \n\nI arrive for \"training\". I wont go into depth but Frank is one part People Greeter, one part mail clerk. Nothing Security related. His desk is a nightmare. I can't stress that enough. *A nightmare*. I cannot believe B has put up with him for six months. I actually spend the week training *him* on basic computer usage. \n\nThen we start the back and forth confusion. HR tells me that B hates me and I already screwed it up. The next day Security Manager B tells me I am his favorite, that he has always wanted me to work for him, and that I'm hired at half again Franks pay. I talk to Company B's people. They HATE Frank. Have hated Frank. And have been begging for a new guard for months. \n\nFor the last two weeks its flipped back and forth like that. HR tells me one thing, the manager contradicts it, Im told the client loves me. Im told the client cant keep me for legal reasons. Meanwhile I have worked like a dog to build this security post up from zero. And I think I've done an amazing job. But I have two days left next week before Franks vacation ends. \n\nI storm into HR and demand to know who is telling the truth. They say \"Its complicated\". If they're to be believed; seems all the big wigs involved on both sides are at a deadlock. Nobody is committing to an answer and clearly some/one either favors Frank for some reason or just hates me. I'm currently not even scheduled to work *anywhere* this time next week, because nobody knows what to do with me. \n\nI'm used to incompetent security guards screwing up my account but I've never actually lost a... competition, if you can call it that, with one before. I can only shake my head and laugh. I hope everyone finds some humor in this too and I'll keep updates for when I hear something. ",

        "text": "Alright my security friends, another interesting yarn for you all.\n\nSo I unfortunately happen to live in one of the states where the partaking of marijuana recreationally happens to be legal, but smoking it in public is still illegal ( even though soooo many ~~homeless~~ street lawyers claim the opposite) and even if it wasn't it is not allowed on property owned/operated by the transit system.\n\nNow I made contact with an individual that was smoking right by the doors of our main terminal and well on the property. I started by asking what business he had at the station because he's also been there quite a while and he stated none ( we don't allow people to loiter if they are not planning to use one of our many modes of transportation), so I informed him that because he wasn't waiting for transportation and for his use of the pot he would have to leave. Now this guy was fine with this, he started to get his stuff together to go. On the other hand the lady near him seemed to have an issue with this.\n\nThis individual was one of the previously mentioned ~~homeless~~ street lawyers. She started off ~~screaming~~ vigorously defending the position that anyone can smoke pot anywhere even on privately owned property that does not allow it and that I also don't have the right to kick anyone off for loitering either. My attention obviously goes to this individual now. Now at this point I have plenty to *kindly* ask this individual to leave, but  I like to be able to get as much as I can before booting them as a CYA just in case. So I proceed to ask this individual what they are waiting on and she states something about a friend possibly meeting them somewhere in 3 hours to a week. So I inform this individual that due to her conduct ( now if someone respectfully questions my decision I have no problem talking to them about it but when they start off screaming I have issues ) and the fact that she isn't using our services, she would have to leave as well. This of course makes her even more happy and starts ~~screaming~~ vigorously stating that I am violating about every right she can think the name of and that she's going to get me fired. She then states she would like to talk with my supervisor (little chuckle from me). I say fine and call him up. Now this guy has a lot less patience than I do. He comes up and I let him know what is going on, then just as a CYA he goes and gets her side. As soon as she finishes, he just starts laying into this lady. saying she has about 5 seconds to leave otherwise she's getting arrested and the police can finish dealing with her as well as a few other things. This lady gets up and finally starts to leave. She of course is even less happy and as she's leaving she's yelling that her brother is the DA and she's going to make sure he sues us back to the stone age and a few other choice words that can't be said on here. Those last few comments gave us a pretty good laugh later, oh and surprise never have been sued yet working there.",

Now a little background when dealing with calls like this, if possible ( if not enough witnesses or if the complaint is grey area to not allow an individual to ride), the way I like to handle these is I ask the responsible party to de-board then after verifying that fare was paid and no suspensions currently active I will attempt to get them on the next transportation to their destination as long as they work decently with me. Most people don't have too much of a problem with this, and it seems the most fair all around.\n\nI board the bus in question and the operator points out the person in question. Now I can smell the alcohol coming from this individual from about 10 feet away and I could tell he was causing problems. I nicely ask the individual if he could follow me off the bus that I need to talk to him. After he refuses I more authoritatively state that he needs to leave the bus. After that this individual get highly upset, whips out an un-armed security guard card and states \" I am a licensed security guard and I don't have to listen to you\". now don't get me wrong I am all for professional courtesy, no matter the type of guard you are, but he obviously was causing a lot of problems on the bus and had to go so my response was \" I don't care, you are causing a disturbance and are getting off the bus, either by your own free will or mine the choice is yours \". needless to say he got off the bus. I was also able to get him a ride, just not to his intended destination. He ended up getting a ride to detox via the detox van.\n\nQuestion I would like to pose to all who read. Do you ever have problems with other security personnel trying to get out of things because they are security as well. And what levels of professional courtesy do you give and/or recognize as a peer?

        "text": "After my last story about [horrible security officers](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/63o218/tales_from_the_hospital_the_worst_security/) someone said that they [feel sorry for the nurses](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/63o218/tales_from_the_hospital_the_worst_security/dfwwrck/).\n\nLet me tell you; I *don't* feel sorry for the nurses. Or any of the other medical staff for that matter. For every bad thing I've seen security do, I've seen the medical staff do things far worse many more times over. [I know I'm not the only person who has had bad experiences with nurses either](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/5em3y9/hospital_security_supervisor_here_i_have_some/). \n\nNurses seem to absolutely *HATE* security, and while some of it might be justified because of the bad security personnel who exist, they also take out their hatred on those of us who are actually competent and don't deserve such mistreatment. Not only security either, but most of the nurses I know have bad attitudes in general, hate their jobs and don't like dealing with patients. From what I've gathered, the ultimate goal of every nurse is to eventually move up into a middle-management position where they don't have to deal with patients anymore, but can lord their minor authority over anyone unfortunate enough to cross their path. Almost all of them are in school to get \"Bachelor of Nursing Administration\" degrees in pursuit of this goal. \n\nDoctors are slightly better, as long as you [don't mess with their cars](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/5ysgxb/tales_from_the_hospital_bill_nye_the_ferrari_guy/).\n\nBut I digress. This story is going to be about badly behaved medical staff to give you a taste of how awful a lot of these people are. To begin, we shall examine one of the worst areas of the hospital: The Psych Department.\n\nFor reference, this psych department is a small four-bed unit. It isn't meant to be for long-term stays. Patients get evaluated and then either released or transferred to an in-patient psych facility. However, the psych staff has always been terrible and they have had a long standing feud with security. Whenever anything goes wrong in psych, security is *always* blamed, even when security wasn't involved in an incident at all. As the security site supervisor once told me, we are \"guilty until proven innocent\" and the burden is always on us to disprove any accusations made against security. The psych staff are never asked to produce any evidence supporting their accusations.\n\nAnyway, on to the stores...\n\n**Chair Hanging:** This was the first major incident that caused people to start to suspect that things were not as they seemed in the psych department, but it was quickly swept under the rug.\n\nA patient was suicidal and for some reason the medical staff allowed him to have a chair in his room. Patients are not supposed to have chairs in the psych rooms unless they have a visitor with them, and then the chair must come out when the visitor leaves. The psych staff is also responsible to monitor psych patients at *ALL* times. They have their own CCTV camera system in the patient rooms for this purpose.\n\nWell, the psych staff obviously wasn't paying any attention to Chair Guy, since they not only allowed him to have a chair, but obviously weren't watching him when he used the chair to hang himself. He tied the sheet from his bed around his neck, tied the other end to the back of the chair, then he 'slumped' down on the floor until the sheet tightened around his neck. He was still alive when they found him, but lack of oxygen caused permanent brain damage and he died a few days later.\n\nSomehow, even though security was not present when it happened, security was not responsible for this patient, security didn't put the chair in his room and the psych staff was 100% responsible for all of this, security still got the blame and we were forced to do extra patrols of the psych department for a few months. That was when \"Gary\" from my previous story got fired for telling the psych staff that the whole incident was their fault. \n\nThe only reason the hospital didn't get sued or shut down was because the patient had no family. A brief internal investigation was sufficient to sweep the entire incident under the rug. Nobody was ever fired and security took most of the blame (for no reason). \n\n**The First Breakout:** Again, a chair got left in the psych department, but this time in the common area. This chair was a rolling office chair, thus being pretty large and heavy. At that time, the security door leading out of the psych department had a window in it. The window was supposed to be shatter-proof so that patients couldn't break it to get out. \n\nA patient grabbed the rolling chair and used the bottom part with the wheels like a battering ram against the window in the door. The window *didn't* break, amazingly enough. However, the entire pane of glass was broken out of the door itself, and fell out the other side of the door harmlessly. The patient jumped through the now open space in the door. \n\nLuckily he got swarmed by staff and security as soon as he hit the ground on the other side of the door, so his escape attempt was short lived. Somehow security avoided being blamed for this one. The door was replaced with one without a window.\n\n**The Second Death:** Tylenol is a much more dangerous medication than a lot of people realize. If you overdose on ibuprofen you may get sick, but you most likely aren't going to die. Tylenol doesn't *immediately* make you sick when you overdose, so you might initially think you are fine, but later your internal organs start to shut down and you crash very quickly. \n\nA patient with a known Tylenol overdose was transferred back to the psych department, because he was suicidal. Makes sense, right? Except that he hasn't crashed yet, which means he still needs to be under medical observation to make sure he doesn't die. As usual, nobody in psych is paying any attention. They just stuff the guy in a room and ignore him for hours on end. \n\nHe dies. Again, security narrowly avoids being blamed (even though we never had any involvement). The psych nurses got \"laid off\" because they gave the excuse that they \"didn't know\" how to take care of patients with medical issues (which makes no sense, because they were certified RNs just like any of the others). Now the hospital makes RNs from the regular emergency department staff the psych department as well, which they *HATE* because they didn't sign up for that when they were first hired. That only results in nurses back there being even more disgruntled than usual. The psych evaluators, who actually are in charge in the psych department, were somehow not punished and kept their jobs.\n\n**The Big Breakout Attempt:** To preface this story, you have to understand that in addition to four patient rooms and a common area, the psych department also has a secured work area. The work area is divided from the patient common area by a glass barrier and a security door. Inside the work area is another security door that leads back out into the emergency department. To get out of psych, you either have to go out the door from the common area or the door inside the work area, both of which connect back to the same hallway inside the emergency department.\n\nA prisoner had been released from prison and for reasons unknown to me, the prisoner was immediately placed on a mental health hold and brought to the hospital. He was an older white male, but covered in jailhouse tattoos, including those clearly associated with white nationalism. The patient was violent and uncooperative the night he came in, forcing us to fight him, put him in four-point leather restraints and medicate him to the point of unconsciousness to get him under control. The patient was transferred into the psych department while still asleep.\n\nThe next morning the day shift medical staff takes over and they aren't familiar with the patient. I'm not sure what, if anything, was passed on to them by the night shift. What happened next, I watched through the CCTV footage after the fact.\n\nThe patient comes out of his room and you can see him on the footage gesturing toward his room, trying to get the attention of the staff. The RN and the tech both get up from their seats, open the door of the work room leading to the common area and walk directly into the patient's room. They leave the door connecting the common area to the work room *open*. While they are messing around in the room, the patient walks directly into the work area and walks right up behind the psych evaluator, *who clearly wasn't paying attention*. \n\nWhen the psych evaluator turns around and sees the patient standing behind her, she shouts for help and the other two staff members come running back into the work area. The tech, a big overweight guy, escorts the patient back into the common area and closes the door. Somehow, nobody felt this warranted keeping a closer eye on the patient or notifying security of what had taken place. It was *obvious* on the video footage that the patient was testing them to see how difficult it would be to escape.\n\nA little while later, the patient is still standing in the common area, lurking near the door into the work area. The psych evaluator is out of the psych department and only the RN and the tech are inside the work area. As soon as the RN opens the door, the patient pushes his way through the door, shoves the RN down to the floor and then tries to run to the second door which leads out into the emergency department. Luckily this door is locked. The tech gets up from his chair and tries to restrain the patient, but the patient fights back, knocks the tech to the floor and injures the tech's knee in the process. \n\nAt this point the RN triggers the duress alarm for the psych department, which is *the first notice that security receives* that anything is amiss. This alarm also triggers an audible alarm in the emergency department, so *everyone* in the emergency department starts moving in the direction of the psych department entrance. \n\nUnfortunately, the incompetent psych counselor (the same one the patient almost snuck up on earlier) returns to the department and opens the door leading into the work area before anyone else can arrive. As soon as the door is open, the patient bolts out the door. The psych evaluator cowers in the corner when she sees him. Several male RNs come around the corner and try to stop the patient, but he ducks and weaves past them like he is playing flag football. He ends up making it about 20 feet down the corridor, bypassing about a half dozen people, before he finally gets tackled by a security officer who was responding to the duress alarm. \n\n*Security stopped this guy, when everyone else mostly succeeded in enabling his escape.*\n\nHowever, even as additional security officers were showing up to help, the smart-ass remarks were already starting. One registration lady asked a security officer \"Aren't you a little late!?\" Another RN was running around screaming \"Where was security!?\" \n\nAs always, we were \"guilty until proven innocent\" in this case. Luckily, I quickly ran back the CCTV footage, noted all of the above screw ups by the psych staff (leaving the door open, entering the patient's room, letting him sneak up on the psych counselor, letting him hang around the door, opening the door for him, etc, etc, etc) and I wrote a *MASSIVE* report which showed conclusively that the entire incident was caused by the psych staff being careless and not paying attention. If I had not written that report, we *definitely* would have been blamed. \n\nSecurity was eventually cleared of any wrong doing. The report I wrote was apparently reviewed by the \"global\" level administrators of the corporation which owns the hospital. Nobody was ever fired. The tech who got hurt had to have surgery on his knee. Everyone still hates security for some reason. ",

        "text": "Ok so a little back round info. I worked armed transit security in a significantly large city handling busses, light rail and commuter rail. Our client is the transit police department who has around 7 officers all on day shift supplemented by us ( around 400 transit security) we get busy.\n\nOne night I'm working the cover hours ( working by myself in the sector during shift change so that there is someone out in the area) in a not-so friendly part of the city. Not my favorite time to be working. I get dispatched to a call of a naked individual wandering the train platform, oh fun. Get to the platform and I see said naked individual, an ambulance posted about a block and a half away and one local police officer approximately 15 feet from said individual. Officer asks if ill cover him while he takes him into custody, I of course agree. Officer then deploys his tazer because subject is very erratic and aggressive and....nothing. This fine nude individual doesn't even notice, same with second deployment. the officer and I talk and suspect excited delirium ( what the Florida face-eater guy had for those that are un-aware), a very dangerous state. The officer decides for safety of the local public that he needs to be controlled. The officer tackles him then him and myself just dog-pile him to hold him down. While holding him the EMT's come, tranquilizer in hand, and inject him. Gets the individual calmed enough to strap him to the gurney for transport to the hospital. Not my favorite night of the job and my co-workers loved giving me a hard time about having to dog-pile a naked guy.\n\nTL;DR had to dog-pile naked man to prevent new possible face-eating zombie.\n",

        "text": "I've noticed that a *LOT* of stories here revolve around [terrible security officers](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/61q2yj/how_can_we_still_get_incompetent_guards/) and the [dumb things that they do](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/56c3j3/dammit_slowpez_or_the_time_one_of_my_coworkers/). I've also provided [my personal theory on why I suspect so many idiots get hired to work in security](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/61q2yj/how_can_we_still_get_incompetent_guards/dfn0cob/). \n\nAs it happens, I have a massive number of stories about horrible security officers and various stupid things which they have done. Working in a hospital makes this more common I suspect, since the hospital doesn't want to pay a lot of money for security and naturally hired the cheapest contract company around to provide people who seem like they were rounded up at the bus station. Of course, there are a few of us who are competent, but we are the exception rather than the rule. \n\nAlso, a lot of these people are from the company \"float\" pool. These are employees who aren't stationed at a particular site, but get called in when there is an open shift that needs filling anywhere in the city. A lot of these folks initially applied for a job at a site, but the site supervisor turned them away because they were obviously terrible. When a supervisor refuses to hire someone at a site, the company automatically offers them a position in the float pool, no questions asked. As such, a lot of the \"floats\" are inherently worthless people who the company is fully aware are useless, but just treats them as a warm body to fill a chair when nobody else is available. \n\nI've got a lot of smaller stories, so I'll break them down one at a time. In some cases, these aren't just the stories of bad security officers, but also stories of how I played pranks on bad security officers to punish them for being bad.\n\n**Ray:** This guy is one of the floats. I didn't pay much attention to him for a long time, but I noticed a lot of other people complaining about him and eventually started to catch on as to why they all hated him. He constantly argues with everyone and always wants to \"play devil's advocate\" in order to provoke arguments even when there isn't any good reason to argue. He once started an argument with one of our good security officers who is also a Sergeant in the National Guard. Ray went off on a huge rant about how the National Guard isn't a \"real\" branch of the military and he wants his \"tax dollars\" back. Another time he started an argument with me when I was talking about the [Metcalf Power Substation Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalf_sniper_attack). I was trying to explain how expensive the power transformers can be and how they can be difficult to replace, since the power companies only keep so many of them on hand. \"Oh, thats not true! Those things are easy to replace! They are just wires!\" This was when I started to get the hint that Ray was an idiot.\n\nSo I began pranking the computers whenever he would follow me at a post. I used the [Task Scheduler](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383614%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) to bring up a picture of Kimbo Slice and a message saying \"I'm in yo computer, sucka!\" Then the computer would shut down. Since he was a float, he didn't have an account to log in at the site and would have to call someone else to help him get back into the computer. Naturally, he complained the computer was \"hacked\" and eventually started blaming me for it.\n\n**Dinty Moore Beef Stew:** We actually started calling this guy that, or DMBF for short. He is an older, incredibly overweight, generally incompetent security officer. He never does patrols because he doesn't like to walk and often pretends that he doesn't know his way around the hospital so people can't ask him to do things. He earned his nickname because one day he actually brought a can of Dinty Moore Beef Stew to work with him. An industrial sized can too, something like 40oz or more. He didn't cook it or even warm it up or even bother putting it into a bowl. He just popped a hole in the top of the can with his pocket knife and started *CHUGGING* it. He *DRANK* the whole can, without chewing. Everyone was horrified.\n\nI started pranking him the same way I pranked Ray. Except in the case of DMBF, I made sure it was a can of beef stew that popped up on the screen instead of Kimbo Slice. \n\n**Chavez:** This guy was mostly just goofy, but not really the sharpest tool in the box either. He had weird behaviors, such as *dancing* in the emergency department, or pretending to swing a golf club. One time he stood in front of some of the hospital staff and did this weird karate stance, then switch to an 'airplane' like stance with his arms out. He kept doing that for a few minutes until one of the staff yelled at him to go away. He \"creeped out\" the staff, according to them.\n\nOne night Chavez started telling us a story that while patrolling an office, he saw a \"face\" in the glass on the door to that office. He swore the office was \"haunted\" because of this. So I began playing pranks on him whenever he entered that office. There was a storage room behind it and I would go in there and scratch on the walls and make thumping sounds. He eventually stopped going in there. \n\n**The World's Dumbest Lesbian:** This isn't a commentary about her sexual orientation. However, this was legitimately what we called her, because she was dumb, she was a lesbian and these two factors combined into a very unusual problem. It was creepy enough when the weirdo loser male security officers would try to flirt with the nurses. Now imagine a female security officer trying to flirt with them. Not only that, she did it badly, by trying to show them pictures of herself in her underwear and asking them questions like; \"Do you like girls? I do!\"\n\nShe was eventually \"transferred\" to a job where she didn't have to interact with anyone. \n\n**Gary:** Gary had been a police officer for something like 30 years. Then he worked for our security company for another 20. He had to be at least 70 years old. He worked at an older hospital that had been shut down and he was the last guy left there, just guarding the building against squatters and scrappers. When they finally tore the place down, the company had to find somewhere else for Gary to go. So they sent him to us. \n\nOne of Gary's legs was visibly longer than the other, such that he walked with an absolutely *massive* limp. It seemed like he would almost fall over when he took a step. He was grumpy as hell and couldn't walk very far, so he didn't really do much. At some point while he worked with us there was an incident where the psych department staff screwed up and let a patient kill themselves while they were on a psych hold. So the hospital made security do extra patrols of the psych department, since punishing us somehow made sense when it was the psych staff who screwed up. None of us were happy about it, but Gary actually took it upon himself to mouth off to the psych staff about their screw up. He finally got fired for that, but not because he couldn't walk.\n\n**Gilligan:** A young guy who seemed okay for the first few years he worked with us. Yes, he actually worked with us for a *long* time and was pretty okay for awhile. However, he started to get lazy and careless after awhile. Other badly behaved security officers actually made him worse, since they set a bad example for him and created obvious examples of how you could be irresponsible and not get fired. Gilligan had a whole bunch of stupid incidents, including one time when they caught him up on the roof of the hospital playing on his phone. One of the hospital executives saw him sitting literally on the edge of the building and thought he was going to jump! Security got banned from going on the roof after that, but somehow Gillian didn't get fired.\n\nOne night, Gilligan pulled a stunt worthy of /r/letsnotmeet. He was asked to escort one of the house keepers to one of the medical plaza buildings which is closed at night because she didn't have keys to get in. He escorted her to the building, but then kept following her around and flirting with her even after she had told him she wasn't interested. It got reported and not only did it turn out that the girl was underage (17), but her *DAD* was actually a supervisor in the house keeping department at the hospital. *THAT* finally got Gilligan fired, although he should consider himself lucky that he didn't end up with criminal charges. \n\n**Coke Guy:** Last, but definitely not least, this guy is my personal favorite. \n\nCoke Guy got fired from the TSA. Naturally, the next place he found work was at the security company. He was in the float pool and had already been banned from three other hospitals before coming to work at my hospital. He openly admitted these facts to us, as though he was proud of his record of bad behavior. Rumor was that he had been banned from previous hospitals for being \"creepy\" and following nurses around.\n\nCoke Guy looked like Gollum from Lord of the Rings. He was short, hunched over slightly and balding. He did indeed give off a generally \"creepy\" vibe. However the most noteworthy thing about him was that he drank massive quantities of [Coke Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_Zero) at all times. He would literally go into the hospital cafeteria at the beginning of every shift and buy entire arm fulls of Coke Zero bottles to supply himself for the night. \n\nOne night he came running into the security office at the end of his shift. \"Has anyone seen my coke Zero!? I can't find my Coke Zero!\" The supervisor asked him to calm down and turn in his daily activity report. He turned to the supervisor, made a \"shush\" motion with his hand and said \"Ssssh! I'm looking for my Coke Zero!\"\n\nThat made us hospital number four that Coke Guy was banned from. He was such an interesting character that I made sure to follow his career for awhile after that. He got sent to another hospital which had just constructed a new facility, but the old facility was still intact on the property. Once he was banned from the new hospital, he got sent to the abandoned one. He actually managed to work at the abandoned one for awhile, since there wasn't anyone there for him to annoy.\n\nOne night I called over to the abandoned hospital. Another security officer answered the phone. \"Hey is [Coke Guy] there?\" I asked. \"Yeah...?\" he answered, obviously confused why some random person was asking for someone bay name. \"Is he drinking a Coke Zero right now?\" I asked. There was an obvious pause on the line, and you could tell he had stopped to look at Coke Guy. I'm *sure* he was drinking a Coke Zero and this guy was probably shocked that I knew that. \"*Who is this!?*\" \n\nI'm not sure what became of Coke Guy after the abandoned hospital was finally torn down. Nobody has been able to locate any sign of him recently, so the theory is that he finally got fired. He probably works at another security company. ",

        "text": "Hey /r/talesfromsecurity, I wanted to share the time I saw a homeless jesus christ give money to strippers, as well as the time I threw said jesus christ out of the club. Sorry for any grammer mistakes or formating. \n\n\nAlright, so my job position was internal security for a strip club. I was the guy that watches over the girls specifically, as well as the bar. There is a doorman, doing his thing, and normally a 3rd position that rotates outside. On this night there is no 3rd person, so as needed the internal guy, me, gets called for walkouts and random shit. It's a very slow night.\n\nIt's about 10pm, I'm radioed outside for a \"Smoke disturbance\" - which is a performer whom is being approached or bothered while smoking outside, so I exit the rear door and walk around the corner to the smoking area, some benches under cover with ashtrays. I find a homeless looking dude, young, wearing a crapton of layers of clothing, his backpacks obviously were how he lived, sitting on the bench closest to the front exit. Smelled like Melon Four Loco, like he had been drowning in it. \"Good evening, If you don't have business with the club I must ask you to keep moving.\" I'm rather blunt, because many people try to hangout there and be creeps. Now I forget exactly word for word, but he said he had business with the club, and that he was just teaching a women Hebrew. Now at first, you always start at confusion. \"What?\" now that was my mistake boys, don't be stupid like me because I always fall trap here, I said what. He continues to tell me, he is traveling and educating others in Hebrew, and asked if I wanted to learn. \"No. I want you to leave, you don't have business here.\" He then asks me if he can come into the club if he pays cover, I told him no and told him he smelled like alcohol and I don't like him, I can't be wasting time outside the building while my girls inside are unmonitored. We take it very seriously,  somebody needs to watch the wigglys and jigglys, so me entertaining this dude is not worth another minute. I gave him the ol \"I'm asking nicely, please leave.\", I said it with conviction. The guy stands up and starts drunk apologising, he says his name is Jesus Christ and he's here to educate the people, and he will be on his way. So I watched him leave the property line and went back inside. \n\nWhile I was gone, some guy on the 2nd floor said something dumb and some sort of argument ensued, and so I went up stairs and they were waiting for me. Immidately upon me walking up, the guy reconsiders whatever's going on and pays the girl. I haven't even said anything and the situation is difused. I asked the guy away from the girls what occured, and he said she was misleading and he just wants to avoid that one single performer. So I walk him downstairs and pair him up with a ladie he pointed out, win win this night will be over soon. \n\nI turn around... And there's Jesus Christ, front row of the strip club wearing a suit. Tie, coat, tie bar, a full suit. I stopped exactly where I was and stared at him, it's Jesus alright, but he changed his cloths. Center chair, front row of the main stage with a performer getting a stage dance. Now last time I saw this guy, he was clearly homeless, complete with drunk ramblings about Hebrew. Now I just watched, that's what I do, and this crazy fucking homeless guy starts giving the stage dancers singles and talking at them. Couldn't hear what's being said, but he's talking... Dancer is not responding, shes doing her thing and Jesus puts down another single. At this point, the world froze. I've seen some shit boys, OD's, deaths, fights, shootings, warrants and many different Jesus christs, but this specific homeless Jesus Christ is giving money to a stripper. What the fuck am I watching, where the fuck am I?? He spends about $9 in singles on 3 dancers, not much but stage dances are mostly singles. He then gets up, goes into the back shady row, and orders a beer. \n\nNow during this time I'm talking to my manager on the radio, this specific manager wants to know if I'm going to remove somebody prior to doing it if possible. But over the radio in a loud club he can't understand Jesus Christ has been drinking prior to entering and that's my reason. So because my manager has a since of humor, I think, he says \"As long as he's drinking and buying dances he's not a problem, He seems alright(in reference to me saying he smelled like Loco). Against my wishes, my manager wants Jesus to stay, but he's on my list. So I watch. I watch as 2 girls approach to sell him dances and he refuses, the 3rd girl sits with him. I watch... They're talking... But I notice, the look on her face turn awful. I move within line of sight of the dancer, so she can see me behind him. She looks at me directly in the eyes with a look of horror, this is my job, I can tell when I'm needed but I must be careful. I approach them and inform the dancer that a manager is looking for her, \"would you please come with me?\" I intend my hand and she clings to my arm as we walk away. She says to me without any prompting \"He says his name is Jesus, and that sinners drink alcohol, and wanted to pray with me, he started trying to teach me Hebrew, and sitting down was a mistake.\" These small moments are nice, builds trust as well as its fun to be the protector sometimes.  She's explaining to the manager the WTF that just occured, and I'm reinforcing the \"can I kick him out now?\". My manager says no and points, there's another performer who fell for the trap and sat down. Except this time it's a performer the doormen don't like, she doesn't tip, leaves without escort which gets security in trouble, and a complete bitch. That too. We sat at the bar and laughed. She wasn't signaling me and I'm not taking the effort for a women who previously said mean things to me. Were enjoying the silent justice as bitchqueen gets a Hebrew lesson from Jesus. Well, Sunday night we lose at 12. Bitchqueen escapes the Hebrew lesson and by now the talk in the dressing room is \"avoid that guy\". \n\nThe night draws to a close, last call song, 3 songs, then the lights come on and you remove anybody still sitting. So I'm removing the last tables and there's Jesus Christ in the back, praying loud enough for me to hear him. I walk straight up to him and honestly I just stared in confusion, I guess I'm going to Hell for interupting prayer. \"Time to go, stand up lets roll\" initially he ignores me, so I place my hand on his shoulder and he stands up. Now things move quickly here folks, \"Your a demon and Hell is where your going, and where you will be!\" and he yells this, aggressively, with what I will call \"angry tears\". So at this point I really wanna get done, so close to going home. \"Leave or I ruin your suit.\" honestly, were strip club bouncers not Wal-Mart greeters, were not required to be nice under these circumstances. \"(weird yelling about going to hell)\", so I'm 6'6\" 300lb, he's a small super skinny 5'10\" alcoholic featherweight. I grab his arm, bend, and push him from behind to towards to door. Just a good shove that says \"This is the gentle way.\" on his way out, he goes from walking slow to bolting towards to bar, grabs an unopened beer, and attempts to run out the exit. The doorman, being a good doorman and manning the door, physically stops him, attempts grapple, but can't get the beer away. \n\nThere's the doormen at the door, Jesus Christ holding a beer, and me on the opposite side. He's sandwiched in the exit hallway. He's now yelling that we are demons who drink sin or something of the nature. He holds the bottle upside down and above his head, to hit somebody, but he can't look in both directions. Both of us take a step forward, he now has very limited breathing room between two large bouncers. He turns at me, doorman grabs him from behind and attempts to grab the bottle, as a result Jesus extends the bottle at me, so I swiped it right out of his hand. He turns his head to see who took the beer, and the other doorman lifts him off the ground. He's now at the exit door, clinging to the inside of the doorway like a cat about to take a bath. I briefly push, nope, this cat ant letting go. Why not punch him PaladenConnery? Because then your causing unneeded harm. I use knife hand to the ribs, he lets go. So, when I say he was thrown, he was thrown more than his height out of the door. The guy had airtime, probably a distance record for me. With both myself and the other guy pushing him, then letting go of all the pressure at once, he flew out the exit. The camera shows him getting airtime out the exit door. We immediately lock the doors behind him and turn around to a cartoon-esc staircase full of performers laughing at all the shit he was yelling. Mostly a lot of \"You're going to Hell\". \n\nNow believe it or not, between me and the other doorman, I'm the diplomatic one. Right? That tells you why I'm now supposed to go outside rather then the other guy who's not so diplomatic. We are not able to walk girls to the cars, Jesus Christ is at the exit yelling threats. So I go outside, and I'm not kidding, \"Jesus, listen, you have already shown me your a threat, if you won't leave, you will be fighting me and (notsodiplomaticfriend). I really want to be clear. Leave now, or you'll wish you did\" and I'm trying to be big and scary and the dude starts crying. He randomly starts telling me his wife doesnt believe in \"him\", something about their baby, something about heaven and sin and whatever. So I drop the tough guy for a second. \"Jesus, listen buddy, leave. Start walking. You will find your path, but if you stay, you will be hurt.\" and he cries more, and drunk apologises as he leaves. \n\nI go back inside, I have a bunch of ladies that must be walked out individually one at a time, so I start, one at a time. The doormens position at this moment, is watching the camera right next to the door, watching me and able to let me back in. I walk out 4 ladies, and on the 5th, Jesus runs at us aggressively from off property. The performer locks herself in her car and I run at him, running at me, I shoulder chuck him pretty darn hard. He just tried to bull-rush a 300lb strib club bouncer. Bad Jesus. He's on the ground and starts apologising prior to me making a hole in the earth using his body, other doorman runs up behind me for backup. I yell and curse and threaten him with the other doorman until he bolts off. Bolts straight across a 4-lane street at full speed at what is now 1am. \n\nThat was the last time I was Jesus Christ, he's a durable guy. Obviously some drinking problems and mental health issues, but hey, what do you expect of Jesus. \n\nI rarely get to tell the full story, I always have time for the front half or second half, but that is the story of the time I saw a homeless person give money to a stripper, and the time I ejected Jesus Christ from a strip club. \n\n\nNext story: \"Where the Hell did those 40 Drunk Australians get to?\"",

        "text": "I was just a witness to this story but I found it quite funny.\n\nI worked in a supermarket that had one of those pick ’n mix candy stands. As you can guess it was quite normal for people to “sample” the candy no matter how many signs telling them not to. If caught, staff (including our security staff) would just tell people to please don’t and leave it at that.\n\nSo there I was, restocking something close to this candy stand, when our security guard walks by on some errand. He spots some 19-year-old eating some and says to him:\n\n“Hey; please don’t eat the candy. Like everybody else, you have to pay for It”. \n\nHe says it smilingly while passing by, not even slowing down. The young guy, of course, looks our security guard in the eye, flips him off and jams a handful of candy in his mouth. Bad decision. \n\nOur security guy doesn’t take kindly to this and slams into the guy, forcing him to the ground causing him to spit candy out; in an impressive arch I might add. Our guard restrains the now very surprised and stunned guy, gets him off the floor and marches him to the holding room. In the process telling me to come with them as a witness.\n\nOur store has a policy that thefts under $3.5 are dealt with without police (actually 25 crowns – but I liked the “tree fiddy” reference when I checked the exchange rate). Offenders normally just gets a stern talking to and are let go. \n\nBut as I said, our security guy was pissed, so he gets the cops, who happened to be close by. The now flabbergasted guy gets a $70 fine (500 crowns), a mark on his criminal record for theft and a free ride to the police station. All he can stammer while this is being processed by the guard and the police is:\n\n“What’s happening? Why? How? But, it was just some candy.” And variations of that theme. \n\nHe really looked like he didn’t understand how some candy could cause him so much trouble. The mark on his criminal record will be  a big issue with many employers in my country. The security guard jokes around with one of the cops (they knew each other) and me afterwards telling us: “I just can’t stand bad manners”. I’d say so.\n",

Boss tells them the story and lets them know we have footage from our cameras. Officer follows us to the upstairs bar, and into our liquor room. As my boss is narrowing down the time frame, a call comes in on the officer's radio that said the Uber driver was getting charged with a dui. On top of that, my boss said we wanted to press charges on the tagger, as well. So it looks as if... Justice was served....",

        "text": "This will be a bit less exciting than some of [my previous stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/59a58a/tales_from_the_hospital_blood_guy/). I work in hospital security and most of our trouble revolves around the emergency department, although homeless people do cause trouble elsewhere on the property frequently.\n\nAs mentioned in some of my previous stories, visitors and patients have to stop at a security checkpoint and go through a metal detector before entering the emergency department. Ambulances are obviously an exception to this, since they arrive in the Ambulance Bay and bypass the security checkpoint entirely. In general, the only *other* exception is for on-duty law enforcement personnel. They are obviously allowed to take their weapons with them, as long as they are on duty and have some official purpose in the emergency department.\n\nSometimes I encounter off-duty law enforcement personnel who believe this rule should also apply to them. They often flash badges, ID cards or other objects at me thinking that I will be impressed enough to let them through. I generally ignore this and simply continue with the interaction as if they were a normal visitor. Most get the hint and take their weapons back to their car. Some frown. A few argue. \n\nOne guy is a visitor who often comes in with a \"frequent flier\" patient. He is always dressed like a biker (jeans, leather, bald head, long beard, tattoos, etc.) and *always* flashes some kind of ID at us. As per my usual policy, I ignore this and merely continue the interaction as if it didn't happen. This is not usually a problem with this guy, since he always leaves his weapons outside anyway. (*So why flash the ID? Good question!*)\n\nWell, the other day I guess the security officer at the checkpoint wasn't sufficiently impressed by whatever ID it was that he had been flashing at us all this time and an argument broke out. I'm not sure if the S/O made some kind of comment about the ID or if something else happened, because I only watched this event through the CCTV cameras above the checkpoint. I did clearly see on the footage that Biker \"Cop\" Guy got *very* agitated and made some gestures suggesting he wanted the S/O to follow him  outside and fight him.\n\nWe ended up calling the police and they confronted Biker \"Cop\" Guy. I don't know what kind of ID it was that he had been flashing at us, but the police later told us that Biker \"Cop\" Guy wasn't a member of any law enforcement agency and never had been. He was a fake!\n\nUnfortunately, they couldn't charge him with anything because apparently trying to convince a security officer that you are involved with law enforcement isn't a crime unless you attempt to exercise some kind of law enforcement power (such as an arrest or a traffic stop). All they could do was tell him to quit being a dick and go away.\n\n**EDIT TO CLARIFY THE LEO ISSUE:** Our policy allows *ON DUTY* law enforcement personnel to carry their weapons anywhere they wish. Our policy treats *OFF DUTY* personnel just like any other civilian. I hope this clears up any confusion.",

All three times this caused the car thief to drive back into the community and ditch the vehicle. We (and the local sheriff) were unable to locate the suspects the first two times.

All vehicles were recovered without damage abandoned in random driveways in the community. \n\nThe fake thefts were residents simply getting in the wrong vehicle and driving it home. They have this nasty habbit of leaving their keys in the car (which is how the real thefts happened). The resident called in the stolen vehicle and we advised them to call the local sheriff and we started our own investigation including reviewing video footage from our dispatch center and doing patrols of the community. We found both vehicles and met with the resident who took the car, arranged the return to its owner and made sure they didn't want to follow up with a police report. \n\n",

Our site is very well communicated and managed, so they only require the best guards at our company to be there. We have our own managers, and site supervisor, so there is no need for a FSM to visit and check up.\n\nAnywho, Jim guy here had the night shift. All he would do was sit there and look at his phone all night, the other two had to remain there to watch the cameras, that's all they had to do, but Jim has to be out and patrol so we have an extra set of eyes on the site. That's means walking a around, and mobile patrol. But nope, not for Jim.\n\nOn our shift we HAVE to at least check 3 critical blind spots, it's required by federal law as well. But not for our boy Jim, he's too busy looking at his phone. The other two in the office encourage him to go out and patrol for awhile and check the critical areas. But Jim has better plans, like sitting there...looking at his phone....\n\nThis continued to go on for sometime. We got him to a point where he does the least amount, which was check those crucial areas, then go back to the office and yep, you guessed it...Look at his phone.\n\nI would be the one who relieved when I came in for Day shift, all he would say to me \"boring night, no passdown\" every morning. The camera monitor guys would share their frustration with me after he had left to go home. All I could do was email the supervisor and management.\n\nThis continued for only 3 weekends, then eventually the security manager put a stop to this crap. She deactivated his card and sat him down to have a chit chat about it. But it gets better, Jim guy came back the next weekend in uniform to \"work\" even after being talked too. He used the outside phone to get buzzed in because his card wouldn't work...Gee I wonder why....??? The guy was to hard headed to realize he got fired. All we had to say was just \"call HR on Monday, and have a pleasant evening.\"\n\nI don't understand how people pass through training and be accepted so easily. Where do they come from, how do they find us?\n\nAnyway that's my story of Jim, he was ugh...quite a guy.",

        "text": "I found r/securityguards last night, and I was referred here as well. For about five years I worked for a large security company doing mobile patrols. You can read more about being a security guard in New Zealand [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/securityguards/comments/61lriw/attacked_by_dog_on_a_fully_fenced_site/). \nPart of this job was doing noise control. Here, if somebody is being too loud the can call the local council and they will either send a council enforcement officer during the day, or it will be assigned to our company during the night. Noise control was a good money maker because we were contractors and each call was $40. If you had to go right through the process of law, you would make $120 because it takes three calls to carry out a seizure. We were given enforcement officer status and issues a warrant of power from the council to do this. \n\nHere are the steps:\n\n* Step1: Roll up to the complainants house, get out of the car and have a listen. If it is wayyy too loud you head over. If you're not sure you can pull out the noise meter and see if they are about the noise limits. If it's obviously someone being a dick and calling in just for a laugh you just drive off. The first visit is just a courtesy call, you would generally go knock on the door and give them a friendly reminder that they are being loud and disturbing people. This step is optional, if people are assholes when you rock up or they are being super loud (like a rock concert at 4am) then we can go directly to step two.\n\n* Step2: This happens when someone refuses to turn their music down after a first visit or something like the above happens. (note: we are not restricted to music, we can act on any source of noise except people noise like talking and yelling). We issue a notice called an abatement or direction notice, it's basically a legal notice along the lines of \"Stop the noise for 72 hours or we will come in and take whatever is making the noise and/or give you a fine\". This stops *most* of the people. Business addresses are a bit different, we don't have the right to enter the property, but each notice given is a $1000 fine. We can give one every visit if need be.\n\n* Step3: This is the big one. If we have to go back a third time, or they don't turn it down on the second visit we would back off, call in another officer and the contact the police. The police will then force entry if necessary and we would then go in and take their speakers or whatever. I have had cases where people have plugged in more speakers so we have been back further times to take more.\n\n\n**The gay couple**\nMy first ever noise control job was to a house in a rather nice area of my city. I rolled up at the house and could hear the music and bass over the engine of my car. Hopped out and it was even worse. I walked up the long drive and knocked on the door. It was answered by a man, I told him I was XXX council noise control.\n\n$me: We have had some complaints about the music, could you please turn it down a bit?\n$man1: Sure, thanks for letting us know.\n\nI then began to walk back down the drive, the music went right down and I was happy. An easy $40....\nUntil the music went right back up. I turned around just to see another man walk out the door, right towards me. Just so you can picture this, he was very obviously gay, from the walk to the clothes - and he had a temper to match. He was not fuckin happy. He started to scream and chew me out, asking me what authority I had to be on his property (we are given statutory powers to enter a property to investigate a complaint, but not a dwelling unless we have issued an abatement). I explained I was just asking him politely to turn his music down and if he did it would not be taken further. He was shaking with rage, telling me he was going to complain, he wanted my name and ID (which I gladly gave), and then told me he was not going to be turning it down. I then explained that if he didn't, I would issue a direction notice. I was told to bugger off.\n\nSo I wandered back to the car, sat down and began filling in the paperwork. He must of saw this and came running towards the car and tried the handle (I have learnt to lock the door when sitting in a marked security car, story for another time). He was babbling on about something, but I wasn't really paying much attention, he eventually went back inside. I went back up the drive and gave the notice. He lost it completely, screaming incoherently while his boyfriend tried to calm him down. He turned the music up again and would not accept the paperwork. I ended up leaving it in the mailbox and we parked up to get the police around.\n\nEventually the police and another officer arrived to begin the seizure. The officer walked up first and told the men we were coming in, he was not very happy about that and attempted to close the door on the officer hand. Mistake. The officer kicked the door in and then pulled the male to the ground, chucked him in handcuffs and hauled him away. The other man was very helpful after this and even directed us to the equipment, we took it and headed back.\n\nI heard he didn't get charged, he was just held to sober up for the night and I know they got their stuff back too. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/bLBuj5g.png) is the report that i filed that night, I just found it. He ended up making a complaint that night which is why I had to file a report.\n\nIf you like these noise control stories, let me know. I have a whole load of them sitting in my head.",

        "text": "xpost from /r/securityguards\n\nJust for a bit of background information about working in the security industry in New Zealand... We are all completely unarmed, this includes knives, batons and guns or whatever. If a guard is caught with a weapon (by the licencing guys, the police are a different story... They tend to not really care), you will at least lose your licence. As above, all guards are need to be licenced and granted specific endorsements depending on the type of work being carried out and then trained on the specific work. For example, you can get the PI endorsement which allows you to work as a private investigator, you could get the CC endorsement which allows you to work as a crowd controller etc etc. Most guards work for large companies as setting up a security company is really a hassle. Only occasionally do you see someone working for themselves.\n\nAnyway, back to the dog story.\n\nThis was around 2010 in the middle of winter, I was working as a mobile patroller carrying out random checks of my usual sites. One of my sites was a large paper manufacturer, they made cardboard products and all kinds of paper crap, the employees are really cool and they showed me around on the night shift one day. In my city we were having an arson problem, you can guess who was on edge about that, yes, the paper company. So they increased our checks from four a night to eight a night. This place was quite big and had a huge security fence around it with an electric gate, the whole nine yards. But... The fence was getting old in some parts. The rear of the building backed onto a railway track which had its own fence. The fence connecting the railway to the paper manufactures yard was corroding and starting to lift around the middle, you wouldn't know unless somebody told you. Of course it was reported every night but the company didn't see it as a risk due to it backing onto a railway line. On this site, I would drive in and then park up, check the doors around the building, check if any trucks were left unlocked and check for any damage to the fence or building exterior. I need to point out, some of the areas I was assigned to were not too friendly, so I was naughty and kept an extendable baton in the side of the door in the car, just in case. On this night, I parked the car up, reluctantly stepped out into the near zero degrees temperature, flicked on the torch and approached the first door. Then I started to hear a distant tapping coming from across the yard, I took a look in the direction and saw a small light so I walked a little closer. The tapping started to get louder and it was about that point my brain woke up and realized it was a dog. I yelled in the hope it would cause the dog to run away but that seemed to just piss it off, it started barking like mad, still running at me. I legged it back to the car, desperately trying to unlock it with the remote before I got back. I quickly realized I was not going to make it back into the car and be able to get back in before the dog could jump in, but I did have time to grab the baton. The dog was snapping at my ankles as I extended the baton and gave the dog a sharp smack in the side. It sort of knocked the dog down but it came back fighting, this time it got my leg so I gave it another smack right in the head, knocking it out. While this was going on I didn't notice the light coming my way, turns out it was a runner, who owned the dog and he was not real happy. He saw the dog, saw me with the baton and called the police. The police showed and asked what happened, I gave my side and he gave his. So, what happened?\n\nThe runner used to run down the railway tracks with his dog on a leash when he noticed the fence starting to lift. He ran at night with the dog because it has previously been aggressive and had been placed on the \"menacing dogs\" register which puts a load of restrictions on when the dog can be out and things like ensuring the dog is muzzled whenever being out in public. He thought it would be a good idea to go under the fence and let the dog loose because it was an enclosed yard and according to his report \"nobody should have been there, not even a security guard\". Normally I would not encounter him because at the time I was doing the extra checks, I would normally be a good 10 miles away on another check. In the end the dog was sadly put to sleep, really because of the owners stupidity and he was given a formal warning about trespassing. The bites were not too bad on my end, I got a night off in which I was not allowed to relax because I had every other guard in the city turning up at one point or another to check out the bites and have a cup of tea. The officer very nicely left out the part about the baton in the report so I dodged a bullet there.\n\nI have plenty more stories if you're interested of if they're allowed to be posted.",

When she saw me she asked if I could let her in, and so I told her she needed a visitor's badge if she didn't work on the site. So, I asked her if she drove there, and if she knew where her car was. She wandered the parking lot with me following her for a good 2-3 minutes before I radioed the front desk officer for assistance. I was told to ask her what year it was, and she said it was 2016. Obviously that was wrong, so I brought her up to the front desk. The poor woman had no drivers license, no ID, no purse. The only thing we found on her was an old hospital bracelet. Turns out, she not only was diabetic, but she had brain damage from a cluster of strokes she had 5 years ago, and so her ability to remember anything was damaged. She was convinced her husband, who divorced her 3 years ago, was working at the site, and they were still married. After we got her some soda and a snack, she calmed down enough to remember her father's phone number. Apparently she gets loose all the time, but to have walked all the way to the site from a neighboring town without any food or drink in the middle of February, was really something. ",

I used to spend a lot of time in the students tv lounge which was one flight up and looked down on the roof of the lower level.  One night in the early hours I was sitting on the couch half asleep,  and I heard a noise outside the window.  Some teenager had decided to climb about on the roofs for a laugh, and the second I saw him, he saw me.  He freaked out and made a run for it.  As I was heading to the stairs I heard a crash.  I ran outside to see him limping away with his other teenage friends.  I didn't bother with them,  they were just kids showing off,  but a little bit later I noticed one of our wheelie bins was half crushed,  which he must have fell on.

I was performing the wand inspections. I had a male step through the mag, and it went off. Like, a lot. Usually the detector tells us where approximately the metal is located to make the search a little easier.

It had at one point been a busy building, with people milling about and socializing, buying food from vendors and knick knacks from stores - but now all 5 floors were generally quiet, most of businesses had been closing up shop and the food vendors now only opened around lunch time, and closed shop after a couple hours.\n\nThe building still had the problems that came with having a welfare office in the building, and the problems that accompanied the area in general. It was a decent shift, and I didn't mind working there.\n\nI had just arrived on site, and I saw 5 people, all of them suspicious - the building had just opened a few minutes before, and one of them was openly drinking from a bottle of vodka, and I had already arrested a couple people from the group at a different site a couple weeks before.\n\nI approached them and told them it was time for them to leave, and if I saw any of them back in the building that day, I would arrest them for trespassing. One of the group lunged forward at me with his arms spread open while saying \"Itssss okaaay officerrrr, yous justs needs a hug!\".\n\nI bladed my stance as his arms began to entrap me, and I shoved him back so hard that he went airborn and slammed against the wall. I arm barred him, spinning him around so fast that he slammed into the wall again, this time face first. I slapped the cuffs on him, and sat him on the ground as one of his buddies walked towards me, \"hey man officer can you just let him go, please?\" To which I responded by pulling out my pepper spray and telling him \"get the f*ck back! I will f*cking spray you and then you're gonna be in the same situation as your friend!\"\n\nThe guy backed up and his friends told him it was time to leave. I get the handcuffed subject to my office, having already frisked him and of course the subject doesn't have any ID on him. Local PD comes out to verify his identity. Cop walks up, \"hey buddy, what's going on with this jackass today?\" I respond \"he is drunk, says he isn't, and thinks he can grab someone paid to carry a gun\" The subject replied \"I just tried to give him a hug, I didn't do anything\" and the cop responded \"oh, is that all? You know better dumbass, get in the car. \n\nHandcuffs were swtiched out, PD headed to detox, and I went to my office, and began typing my report.\n\nReason for use of force: ***WEAPONS RETENTION***\n",

        "text": "Years ago, I worked as a security officer in a high-traffic tourist area (graveyard shift).  \n\nOne of my responsibilities was to make sure my building's loading/unloading zone is kept clear because at all hours of the day we've got vehicles coming and going for people going to meetings, visitors, tourists, cabs, etc.  The curb is painted white and marked in big bold letters ***LOADING AND UNLOADING ONLY NO PARKING***.  At the end of the zone there was a single handicap parking stall painted bright blue.\n\nNow the building I worked at was nearby a few large night clubs, so every Friday and Saturday the area would be crazy busy with drunken fighting, vomiting, occasional alleyway sex, etc.  All night long there'd be cute girls milling around in skimpy outfits, so the job had its perks too.\n\nClubbers would take advantage of my building's valet parking service and pay to park in our garage before heading out to one of the clubs across the street.\n\nSome clubbers would think they could get away with parking in our loading zone all night.  My coworkers and I would aggressively patrol the area in the earlier evening hours and advise as many people as we could so they'd leave and avoid getting a ticket.  It was also better for us if they left, because when there were too many vehicles parked out front, traffic would become a complete clusterfuck regardless of the time of day.\n\nMost people would be grateful for the information and leave.  Occasionally, some douche would laugh in our faces, say something about pigs or rent-a-cops or whatever and leave their car anyway.  In those cases, we'd call our city's parking enforcement and they'd get a $90 ticket for their troubles.\n\nOne Saturday night, after finished a round of patrols, I went to take a leak.  On my way back out, I walked past Dispatch and my buddy calls me over to the surveillance bank.\n\n\"Hey bro, you got one out front.\"\n\nI turned to the grainy feed just in time to see a piece-of-junk '97 BMW sloppily parking in front of our building.  I murmured that I'd go out and advise the driver, but before I could leave, the driver exited his vehicle.\n\nMy buddy and I watched in silence as the driver, a young black male adorned with flashy cheap bling, hiked his pants up at the crotch and blocked the path of a couple girls walking by.  He started hitting on them in the slimiest way possible, even trying to grab their hands and asses at one point, staring shamelessly at their tits while he was schmoozing them.  He took out his phone and shoved it at them, presumably asking for their numbers.\n\nEventually the girls were able to dodge his grabbers and ran off toward the club across the street.  He repeated this routine several more times with various groups of girls walking by, even taking out a small bottle of vodka from his back pocket and offering swigs.  With each rejection, he'd get angry and presumably cuss out the girls as they hurried off (our cameras didn't pick up audio but this seemed a reasonable assumption).\n\nI sighed and looked at my buddy.\n\n\"Well, I guess I'll go talk to him.\"\n\nI made my way out to the front and approached him just as another group of girls ducked away from him.  I called out to him.  He turned and stared at me blankly.\n\n\"Hey, man, just wanted to let you know that this zone is for loading and unloading.  Normally it's not a big deal to park for a bit but if everyone does it on the weekends, traffic gets backed up pretty bad here.\"\n\nThe douche looked at his vehicle, then at my badge.\n\n\"FUCKYOUBITCHASSNIGGAI'LLFUCKYOUUP.  PIGASSWANNABECOPMOTHAFUCKA.\"\n\nI looked at my watch.  It was about 10:30PM.  I continued my spiel.\n\n\"Parking enforcement here is pretty strict.  You should move your vehicle or you might get ticketed--\"\n\n\"FUCKYOUNIGGASUCKMYDICK.  BETTERNOTTOUCHMYSHITNIGGAILLFUCKYOUUPNIGGA.\"\n\n\"Have a good night sir.\"\n\nHe flipped me off and went across the street, where he was promptly denied entry for dress code violations.  He cussed out the bouncer and wandered off down the block.  I walked over to his vehicle and saw that it was parked crooked, the rear of the vehicle partially blocking the lane of traffic.  Half of his vehicle was in the white zone, the other in the blue zone.  I key'd up my radio.\n\n\"8million to dispatch.\"\n\n\"8million, go ahead.\"\n\n\"Can you call parking enforcement for this vehicle?  Lemme know when you're ready for the plate.\"\n\nFifteen minutes later, the parking officer arrived.  He looked at the vehicle and promptly issued a $90 ticket for parking in the white zone and a $900 ticket for parking in the blue zone without a permit.\n\nI thanked the officer and went back inside to have a snack.\n\nA couple hours later, two of the local cops stopped by to say hi.  As [Officer Morris](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/5ul02o/witness_stutterinducer/) and his partner walked over, Dispatch radio'd me.\n\n\"Hey 8million, is that Jones and Morris?\"\n\n\"Sure is.\"\n\n\"You gonna do what I think you're gonna do?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\nOfficer Jones and I lit up our cigarettes as Officer Morris looked on disapprovingly.  We all smoked and chatted for a bit, then I casually motioned over my shoulder at the BMW.\n\n\"Hey, Jones, check out the parking job on that piece of shit.\"\n\nWe all walked over to the corner and looked at the vehicle, the two tickets stuck on the windshield flapping in the wind.  Officer Morris grabbed one of the tickets, read it over and looked at me.\n\n\"What's the story here?\"\n\nI told them what happened and the driver's response.  Officer Jones and Morris looked at each other.\n\n\"8million, you got the time?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's... 12:27AM.\"\n\n\"Well it's a whole new day now isn't it?\"\n\nOfficer Morris proceeded to write another $90 ticket for the white zone, then another $900 ticket for the blue zone.  He paused for a moment after finishing the second one.\n\n\"Hey Jones, looks like this vehicle is parked more than twelve inches from the curb.  What do you think?\"\n\n\"Sounds about right.\"\n\nOfficer Morris wrote another ticket for $120 and slapped it on the pile of tickets on the windshield.  I shook both officer's hands and they left to continue their patrols.\n\nThe next few hours of my shift went by fairly quickly.  Around 5AM, Dispatch scared the hell out of me.\n\n\"HEY 8MILLION, ARE YOU STILL ON THAT CALL?\"\n\n\"Negative, I just finished clearing it.\"\n\n\"RESPOND TO DISPATCH ASAP.\"\n\nI ran down to the surveillance bank, where my coworkers were all gathered and laughing their asses off.  Sunday was street cleaning day and the BMW was getting ticketed again by parking enforcement.\n\nAfter that, we all stopped by Dispatch every 5-10 minutes to see if the owner had returned.  Finally, at about 6AM, douchebag came stumbling up the block, looking completely worn out.  His formerly-white t-shirt was stained and dirty and it looked like he'd lost at least one fight.\n\nWe watched in suspense as he looked at the pile of tickets crammed together on his windshield and slowly removed them.  He stood there, pants sagging below his knees, shuffling through each ticket as if he were a toddler with a handful of Pokémon cards.\n\nWith a look of abject defeat on his face, he got into his vehicle and drove off.  The whole room erupted in laughter and high-fives.\n\nAs the laughter died down, I picked up the office phone and started dialing.  My coworkers eyed me curiously.  I put the call on speaker just as the call connected.\n\n\"9-1-1, what is your emergency?\"\n\n\"Yeah, hi, I'd like to report a possible drunk driver.  I have the vehicle and driver description when you're ready.\"",

Some other posts on this sub cover in detail [how horrible medical staff treats security personnel](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/5em3y9/hospital_security_supervisor_here_i_have_some/) and there are frequent [encounters with intoxicated homeless people](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/5vufh5/dont_block_the_ambulance_bay/). I could bombard you with a lot of similar fodder, but I think we would all prefer something original, and my personal favorite stories are the funny ones, like [the guy who told me about his underwear problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/4y4i2c/its_okay_i_already_took_my_underwear_off/), [the guy covered in blood for no apparent reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/59a58a/tales_from_the_hospital_blood_guy/), or my personal favorite, [the meth-head who was worried about the inhabitants of underground tunnels](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/54eypn/zyprexa_the_porn_star/).\n\nWell, here is another goofy story which I like to call...\n\n**Bill Nye the Ferrari A--hole Guy!**\n\nWhen I first came to work at a hospital, I figured my biggest problems would be with doctors. After four years of torment, I've learned that most doctors are actually pretty nice and it is the sociopath nurses you need to watch out for. There is one exception to this however. When it comes to doctors, they go bats--t crazy over the cars they drive. It doesn't matter if it is an old beater or a brand-new BMW. Screw with a doctor's car and you are guaranteed to see something new.\n\nOne night I'm arriving for work and as I pull into the parking garage, I see a huge bright-red Ferrari sitting parked in a blatantly marked \"No parking\" zone. Not only are there signs displayed which clearly say \"No Parking\" on them, but brightly colored lines are painted on the floor marking that area as off-limits. \n\nOne major detail is off however. Someone has placed a new sign over the top of the \"No Parking\"  sign. The new sign says \"Ferrari Parking Only\" instead. It's obviously one of those novelty signs that someone ordered off the internet, and somehow they glued it on top of the real sign. \n\nI park, report to the security office and ask the day shift crew if they have investigated who is responsible for the \"Ferrari thing\" yet. Naturally, nobody on day shift was paying enough attention to have even discovered this yet and everyone looks at me confused. I resign myself to be the one to do all the work to figure out who did this, as usual. \n\nSo I pull up the security camera footage from the parking garage and run it back until the Ferrari isn't there. Then I run it forward until he arrives and see the guy parking, getting out of the car and putting up his sign. I wait until he gets closer to the security camera so I can try to catch a look at who it is...\n\n\"It's f--king Bill Nye!\" I shout out. \n\nNot really of course, but this idiot could have won a look-a-like contest. He is tall, skinny, wearing a dark suit and has a bow-tie on. At a distance on the security footage, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.\n\nHe manages to get inside the building without having to scan his employee ID badge because he piggy-backed in with someone else (as usual). I can't get his name from the computer, but I already know this a--hole must be a doctor and I know how a doctor will react if someone messes up his little scheme. \n\nSo I steal his sign.\n\nSure enough, he makes an angry phone call to security about a half-hour later and gives up his name. I report him to the hospital. Most likely he will face little more than a lecture from some administrator, but at least I have the satisfaction of knowing I stole his sign and pissed him off. \n\nYou wouldn't ever believe that someone would do something like this and expect to get away with it... but a doctor would apparently disagree!",

I was working security, but specifically, I was working as a plainclothes loss prevention agent.\n\nI was walking the floor, and I saw two girls in their late teens selecting items faster than a teenage can make a decision, so I kept watching them... I followed them and sure enough, they concealed the merchandise in their purses, abandoned their cart, and exited the store.\n\nI only had one pair of cuffs on me that day, so I made sure to approach closest to the girl that had most of the stolen merchandise. Sure enough, as soon as I identified myself they tried to run. Well, the one with most of the merchandise threw her bag on the ground and I took hold of her and she immediately yelled \"I give up!\", I told her to put her hands behind her back and she replies with \"I didn't know you could handcuff me...\" while she complies with the order. \n\nI picked up her purse after I finished handcuffing her and I took her to the holding room for processing. I add up the total and she is under the prosecution policy by *just a couple dollars*, but things get complicated for me - there is about a half ounce of marijuana and a bottle of Jack Daniels in her purse... I have to contact the police regardless of any other part of the situation now.\n\nSo, the police get their and an officer interviews her briefly in my holding room. The officer asks her if the marijuana and alcohol belongs to her and she says \"no, the marijuana is mine but I don't drink! The alcohol belongs to a friend!\" The cop asks her if she knew the alcohol was in her bag and she replies \"Of course! Why wouldn't I know what is on my own bag?\".  The cop takes me aside and asks me what *I* want to do, I tell him its his choice, if he wants to cut her loose he can cut her loose, if he wants to charge for possession he can do that- I really don't care. The cop says to me \"Well, I'm going to need you to sign off on theft charges\", then turns to the girl and says \"alright, you're under arrest for theft, minor in possession of alcohol, and possession of marijuana.\" \n\nAnd then he switched out his cuffs with mine and took her out of the store while she yelled \"but I only smoke weed! I only smoke weed!\".\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We wake them up and take both of them into custody, handcuffing them, frisking them and sitting them down against a wall and ordering them to cross their legs.

I ask the male if he has any warrants or has had any recent police contact, and he says no, adding to it he says he has never even been in trouble with the police. I ask him if he is sure and I tell him I'm going to run him for warrants. The male suspect says that he is not worried about it because he knows he doesn't have any warrants.\n\nSo I run a warrant check on both of them. I inform the female that she will be free to leave as soon as the paperwork is finished, and I inform the male that the police are on the way to the building to take him into custody on his 4 outstanding warrants, half of which were felony warrants.",

Some of them are supervisors, some of them are entry-level grunts, but they all share their amusing stories with me.\n\nHere's one.\n\nMy buddy works a graveyard shift, unarmed, babysitting a downtown office building.  It's seriously one of the easiest posts I've seen.\n\nNot only is the building empty and completely locked down, his post consisted of the following:\n\n - Man the front desk in the empty lobby.  It's out of the line of sight from the front door, so he can snack, watch movies, do homework, whatever he wants.\n\n - No supervisor check-ins.\n\n - Front door is the only way in, no other entrances to worry about.\n\n - No cameras to watch, no DAR or reports to complete.  Once a week, he'd submit a time sheet via email to get paid.\n\n - Once or twice per shift, he has to patrol the five floors of the empty building.\n\n - Shift ends before the building is opened, so there's no unlock responsibilities.\n\n - Pay rate: $16/hr\n\nOne day, for whatever reason, the client decided that they'd like *two* guards for that one post.  So they send my buddy a trainee and tell him to show her the ropes.\n\nThe trainee that showed up was a young black female who'd recently gotten her guard certification.  She was, as my buddy put it, \"ridiculously fat.\"  Leaning forward would cause the tail of her shirt to come completely un-tucked.  She showed up wearing basketball shoes and literally drooled down the front of her shirt several times throughout the training process.  Her belt was completely concealed by her stomach folds.\n\nNevertheless, the show must go on.\n\nSo my buddy does what he's told and shows the trainee the post.  She follows him silently as he takes her up the elevator and they descend each floor via the stairwells.  He shows her where the fire panel is, which doors tended to get stuck and how to unstick them.\n\nFinally, they arrive back at the front desk.  My buddy turns to her.\n\n\"...so once you're done with the patrol, you can pretty much just chill here for the rest of the night.  Any questions?\"\n\n\"I... I think I'm gonna go.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, what?\"\n\n\"I... I gotsta go... I can't be doin all this, I need me a sit-down post.\"\n\nAnd without another word, the trainee waddles to the door and leaves.\n\nMy buddy never heard of her again, and no other trainees were sent after that.",

        "text": "Hey there guys, I was going to post this in r/talesfromcorrections but it seems as though that subreddit is long dead so I thought maybe you guys would enjoy this story.\n\nI worked as a correctional officer for three years in a small county jail. Nothing big time but, I still have plenty of stories. My favorite one to tell is the story I have now named \"The Case of The Missing Chicken\"\n\nFor about six months of my time at the jail, I worked inside the kitchen. Easy as hell job, all I had to do was check out utensils and unlock the freezers for the inmates, at meal time, I just watched the line to make sure no one swiped two plates. Twice a week we would get food shipments in, and my captain was a real stickler for making sure the EXACT inventory was received that he had ordered, and keeping a close watch on it all after we had put it into the freezers and/or storage rooms.\n\nSo, one day as I'm coming back into work after my two days off, my fellow officer in the kitchen (There were three of us, counting my Captain) says he thinks there's an entire case of chicken that has gone missing. My first thought is that this old man has finally lost his mind. Those cases were easily 4 feet long, and weighed quite a bit seeing as they were filled with frozen chicken. My Captain comes in and he checks inventory, sure enough, there's an entire case of chicken gone. Not like they emptied the box and just took the chicken out, oh no, the ENTIRE box is gone. So he locks down the kitchen to try to find out what happened, no dice.\n\nA good hour later, my Captain gets a call from the floor Sergeant to report to A-Dorm. I tag along because, eh, I had nothing better to do. As we're walking there, we can slowly begin to smell burnt chicken, and something else. We get to A-Dorm, and after talking to the Sergeant, I am desperately holding back laughing while my Captain unleashes his full rage.\n\nIt turns out that our well-known kitchen thief, a guy nicknamed New York, had managed to steal the case the afternoon before and get it to A-Dorm to sell. How he managed to do this, I will never fucking know. He got past three guards and 4 locked gates to accomplish this. No one stopped him, no one asked him, \"Hey New York, where you going with that big box that clearly says 'Tyson Chicken' on the side?\" Nothing. Since he was a trustee he basically had free roam of the jail. Its incredible to think that it happened. All the officers said he never walked past them with any box but, there's just no goddamn way. He refused to tell us how he did it, and we never did find out. Most of my superiors were more worried about the fact that he did it, and not how he did it. The only reason he even got caught is because the idiots in A-Dorm decided to try to pile as much chicken as they could at one time into their two microwaves, and ended up frying them.\n\nNew York never did get into any trouble for it, he was known as the \"Jail Clown\" and the warden liked him, so let him off with a warning. He ended up back in the kitchen, an continued to steal. Got off with a warning every time. Some people never learn.",

The guy showed up, unarmed, not an issue since he hadn't gone through required training yet, the only thing he had was a maglite.\n\nDuring the week that I trained him, he told me all about he he used to security at a hotel 15 years before and had arrested 3000 (yes, you read that number right) people in a period of 2 years. Stories of arresting on the run bank robbers, and fugitives he saw on America's Most Wanted.\n\nAround 3am, I saw some suspicious activity at one of the properties, and pulled the patrol vehicle up to it. I got out of the vehicle, and the suspicious person ran down an alley - all of a sudden the trainee takes off after the guy, chasing him for 3 blocks before giving up. I knew who the suspicious person was because I had trespassed him about a week before. The trainee returns, out of breath, staggering from exhaustion... \"he got away\" he says, I asked him what he was going to do if he caught the guy \"I hadn't figured that put yet\" he replied. I asked him what he would have done if the guy was armed, since he was unarmed, he replied, seriously; \"well, I've got my trusty flashlight.\"",

Management radios me, and tells me they need help. They didn't use an emergency code, so I walk in nice and calm and find the manager that called me over the radio.\n\nThe manager tells me that he has asked a group of young adults, (late teens - early twenties), to leave the premises and they are refusing. So I accompany him back to the table the group is sitting at, group of about 5-6 people, all male. The manager again informs them that they need to leave due to the loud noise level and the fact that they were only in there to eat food they bought at a take-out next door to the supermarket.\n\nThey laugh at him. Suburb kids from the participation trophy generation... he wasn't getting through to them so it was time for me to do my job.\n\nI spoke up, I said two words \"leave now\". \n\nThe atmosphere changed. The hostility that had been growing and being directed at the manager was now directed at me as they demanded they were going to buy something and we couldn't make them leave.\n\nI responded by telling them that if they didn't leave, I would begin arresting them for trespassing, one at a time. They looked at each other like they didn't know whether to laugh or run. I told the group to get up, they got up, and I told them to start walking towards the door, and they complied.\n\nOnce outside the door, they turned around, started yelling at me... I told them to back the fuck up or I was going to spray them, well, thats when one of them said \"you can't do anything do to us! You'll lose your job!\"\n\nI replied \"I hope so. I need a vacation.\" and the punk turned around and made a beeline for a vehicle, walking halfway, and running the rest. Another one of the punks decided they should go with him.\n\nNow all of a sudden, the leader of the pack revealed himself, stepping towards me in an aggressive manner and making threats, telling me he isn't scared of getting pepper sprayed...\n\n\"Okay!\" I replied, and drew my ASP baton, deploying it and putting it in the resting ready position. All 4 remaining punks turned and ran towards the car their friends went to,  jumped in, and the car peeled out.\n\nI closed my baton, went inside, and got some coffee.

This was one of them. \n\nIt all started when the guy came in via ambulance. An overdose, found unconscious in a parking garage. He was passed out at the time, but my partner in the ER looked at me and said \"I know him. He's bad news\". My partner at the time used to be a corrections deputy, and worked at a transportation hub downtown as well as at the hospital. She was legit, and I trusted her word. However, I almost forgot about the guy, until he woke up a few hours later. \n\n\"2004, meet me in the rear, stat.\"\n\n\"10-4 en-route.\"\n\n\nI immediately took my gloves out of my back pocket, and I had just finished putting them on when I rounded the corner to where they were.\n\n\"Fuck y'all, who took my money?!\" \n\n\"Sir, you need to back up and calm down.\"\n\n\"Nah I want my fucking money NOW!\"\n\nI gathered pretty quick what the problem was. This transient thought an ER nurse, who makes good money, would risk her job and her future by taking his $10. We both attempted to explain to him that when he came in, he had no belongings. After 5 minutes of extreme patience, the charge nurse discharged him for being disruptive. Now it was time to get him out the door. \n\n\"Fuck this whole place! I'll have all ya jobs!\" He shouted, as he walked toward the exit. He flailed his arms, pointing at everyone he passed. He almost clipped a nurse in the face, which caused my partner to stick out a hand and try and contain the flailing. \n\n\"Don't fucking touch me, bitch!\" Was his response. \n\nHe finally gets outside the door, and we have two more units with us. We were standing in the ambulance bay, which had two rigs in it, when he planted his feet and stated he wanted the police called. \n\n\"Sir, I will call the police for you. However you must know, it's now gonna go the way you think it is.\" I said. \n\nHe squinted, frowned, looked me dead in the eye and said \"do it.\" \n\nI radioed our code for the police to be contacted. At this point, a rig is trying to back into the spot we're standing in. \n\n\"Sir you need to clear this ambulance bay immediately.\" He didn't want to listen. The senior officer on scene finally said \"sir you need to move or we will make you move.\"\n\nAt this point, he walks forward, squares up and says \"move me, bitch.\" \n\nLike a flash, the senior officer grabs him and they tumble backwards between the two parked rigs. They bounce back and forth between the two like a pinball. I ran around to the front just in time to watch them tumble out into the open parking lot. They continued to wrestle on the rain soaked pavement and we all jumped on. The guy had a death grip on my partners cargo pocket and when we finally got it loose, her pants were ripped. He was finally placed in cuffs, and the whole time he told us to take the cuffs off so we could keep going. When PD arrived, he had outstanding warrants, and they charged him for ripping my partners pants. I haven't see the guy since. ",

        "text": "Hey guys and gals,  I just found this subreddit and thought I'd share one of my own experiences.  \n\nWhile on break from college, I was working as a full time floating guard, getting sent from site to site to cover other shifts.  For the most part it wasn't that bad, I wasn't held to many of the regular responsibilities since I would usually work at a site for only 3 days to a week.  \n\nI also made a name for myself as an exceptional employee (because I showed up on time, in uniform, and wasn't an asshole...what a world).  Anyway, because of this I was asked to cover all over the place, for all different shifts.  It wouldn't be out of the question for me to work 36 hours easily a weekend.  \n\nWhatever, overtime sounds good!  Then one day I'm sent to do the night shift at a warehouse in a less then stellar area that had been hit at least 3 times before.  I asked my dispatcher/district manager if I could carry for this assignment (I meet all requirements including CC).  Unfortunately because we live in a state that hates guns, there's no way to get me a carry permit for my state on time (you need to already have a job that requires carrying to get a carry permit here), so I would have to do it unarmed, and alone.  Fine, it's one week and this place has only been hit 3 times in years, what could go wrong?  \n\n4 Days into my station there, I hear something scratching at one of the truck bay doors.  I head outside to investigate, and as soon as the door leading outside bangs shut, I hear someone take off.  The door I exited is just around the corner from the bay doors so I go to turn the corner to at least try to get a description of the guy.  \n\nJust as I'm getting there, BANG, he fires a single shot.  Getting a look at the guy isn't worth my life, so I head back inside and call the police.  I couldn't find the bullet but it definitely ricocheted off the wall, about shoulder level to me... I resigned the next day when my dispatcher told me he needed me there again that night.  $9/h is NOT worth that kind of shit unarmed and alone.\n\nAnyway that's my story.  Stay safe out there everyone.\n\nEdit - spelling",

        "text": "So I've been a lurker here for a minute, so I guess Ill tell you a few of my experiences working in Residential security in high-end large apartment buildings. The company I worked for is by far the shadiest, horribly run, inept gaggle of fuckwits I have ever experienced. There were constant issues with our pay, checks bouncing, no checks on payday. If one day a detective comes and wants to question me about my old bosses murder I wouldn't be surprised. Seriously he could die in front of me and i would go out for drinks to celebrate. This was back in 2009 it was impossible to get a job at that time. I had worked in the food industry as a bartender, waiter for years, even with all my experience I couldn't land a job at Del Taco at the time. So when this security job hired me full time at $12 an hour I jumped at the chance. We worked In beautiful high end spots all up and down Hollywood Blvd and Sunset. \n   Within a few months I found myself one of the most senior employees in the company, suddenly my check would be there on payday when all my guards didn't get paid. I felt horrible but I was trying to get a footing, but every time I started to dig myself out of a hole, another payroll problem would happen. I would work six days a week, 12 hour shifts, I finally was let go and it felt like I had just left a cult. Other than the premature grey hairs and stressing a handful of years off my life I'm no worse for where I guess. The one thing I did get out of that job were the countless stories and happenings that you would expect being the residential security guard to a bunch of Hollywood fuckheads. B,C, and D Listers getting shitty and falling,Kids that were on Disney channel shows fucking going wild every night with parties and women. So thats the set up, thats how I came across some of my stories.\n\nThe Shooting\n\nI was Lead officer of a building off of Hollywood Blvd, that building was my main post and I had been in charge of the whole building 6 months before they completed construction. I made it a goal of mine to take a shit in every penthouse before anybody moved in. Man, the views I got to enjoy while pushing out what would most likely be a parting gifts from El Pollo Loco were breathtaking. So my office isn't completed so I would have to use the front desk in the lobby to type up my reports at night. It was a unusually quiet night considering we were off of Hollywood Blvd and the walk of fame shit. I all of a sudden heard 4 to 5 loud shots, REAL close. So close I ducked a little and waited to hear anything. I checked all the cameras because I wasn't going to go chasing noises of gunshots down any dark alleys. Once I saw the front was clear I walked outside, The street was empty. I looked up and down the street there was nobody out, Then I see some guy jogging up to me asking me If I heard gun shots. As Im speaking to him I notice that a glass border connected to the outside patio of a restaurant was shattered. Now here is where I fucked up, but thank God I didn't get hurt, BTW we looked exactly like LAPD, our uniforms were modeled after theirs, oval badges and all. The jogger informs me he's a nurse, so we both cautiously walk up to the patio,I peered over the wall and I saw a middle aged server with bullet wounds all over he, I fixated on her trying to move her legs, but she was quickly fading out. Next to her is this big black/Mexican guy laying next to her, holding his stomach which is pouring out blood. Right as I peer over the guy grabs his gun but luckily the nurse running over to the woman knocked his gun out of his reach. I kicked the gun into the restaurant that has 5 to 6 women standing there like frozen statues, I remember one girl just standing there with her hand over her mouth crying the whole time. \n   The nurse starts trying to communicate with the lady but she started choking and passed while we were waiting for PD or FD or whoever. LAPD swarms in with 10 to 15 officers guns drawn, rifles out. Since I look just like them they don't tell me to move, now I'm front row, unarmed, and about to see LAPD shred this dude with bullets. The guy is trying to find the gun but Its back inside the restaurant. The cops, contrary to the shit you read on reddit all the time, didn't shoot, and pulled him out. He was trying to do suicide by cop, but i did't have any weapons, he would have shot me for sure. Turns out He was the servers ex-husband, she allegedly stole $1200 bucks from him and moved out of state to get away from him. He found her, stalked her, and shot her 5 times killing her. He turned the gun on himself and shot himself in the gut. She died, he survived and is facing murder charges, or he already got convicted, I never found out. I'll never forget how stupid it was to just pop my head over instead of cautiously approaching the situation. I relay that to my guys I work with now.\n\n   I'll never forget that night, I had to walk a mile to my bus stop to go home. My bus starts at Hollywood and Vine , during the walk I was just numb, thinking to myself about everything I had just witnessed. My bus stop is right in front of Drais Nightclub at \"The W\" at 1;50 am the nightclub gets out and hundreds of people exit onto the plaza at the ground floor. I'm just walking and this guy is arguing with his girl, HE IS PISSED! he's grabbing her arm and whisper screaming \"How Fucking Dare you do this! She's blackout and being a bitch. He flings her arm off of him and she drunkingly stumbles off the curb...Right As A Bus Pulls UP! The bus pops her from behind while slamming on the brakes, I never heard a buss skip it's tires from the ABS. It whops her from behind and she pops across the sidewalk, flying like 6 feet. Somehow the bus was slowed down enough because se didn't get destroyed. \n  \n   At this point my nerves were all fucked up, I'm was jumpy and couldn't sleep that night. My shit fuck boss demanded I show up for work the next day. I really hope my old boss gets eaten by a tiger, It's hard to write about that boss, it takes a lot out of me because I loath his soul and everything he is. But hey, that's Hollywood. I'll write more, I had a two year battle with a large gang of Crust-punks that ended in murder and new friendships. Ask anybody who worked in Hollwierd, where the craziest posts were, they will all tell you Hollywood, It's a beast.\n",

        "text": "Back when I worked mall security, I saw a lot of strange things. This guy was top of the line crazy. A few months into my time at the mall, I started picking up overtime details. The place had an \"entertainment\" section (aka a level with bars and restaurants). One of the places, a chain restaurant ended up having to hire their own security because of all the drunken mishaps they had. As I walk a beat with my partner for the night, I see him. We'll call him Greg. Greg was wearing black tactical pants, and full duty belt, and an external carrier with the label \"Fugitive Apprehension Agent\" on the back. He was armed, he had cuffs and a baton and all the other UoF tools you can think of. He had a jet black pushbroom mustache, and smoked like a chimney. My partner and I traded a look of curiosity, and made our way over to the entrance. Before we got within 30 feet, he was waving at us with a big smile on his face. \n\n\"Names Greg, how are ya fellas?\"\n\n\"Doing just fine Greg. How're you?\"\n\nHe immediately tells us how he picked up the gig, how he ran his own company, and did a little \"Fugitive Apprehension\" on the side. Again, we shared a look. \n\nFor weeks after this, every weekend, we'd see Greg outside checking ID's and shooting the breeze with the local PD that worked a weekend detail at the mall. I even saw his truck once, decked out with decals and a red/blue light bar and siren combo. When we weren't walking a beat, Greg would tell us about all the fugitives he's nabbed, and how a job was ours if we wanted it.  \n\n\nFast forward another couple weeks, and I'm sitting in our office finishing a report when the door opens, and in walks Greg, flanked by two police officers. Turns out, he wasn't a fugitive apprehension agent, he wasn't even licensed, and all his gear was fake. Including the gun. The cops figured all this out when Greg tried to \"arrest\" a man who he was \"sure as shit\" had warrants. He didn't have warrants. All of Greg's gear was logged as evidence, and his \"police\" vehicle was towed and impounded. We didn't see much of old Greg after that. \n",

        "text": "*This story is kind of graphic, especially for those that are squeamish.  I tried my best to describe the events as clear as possible; sorry if any of it is confusing!*\n\n*UPDATE: Thanks for the positive feedback!  I've added some small details to this story based on the comments.  Cheers!*\n\nI spent a few years working as an unarmed security officer at a fairly upscale residential complex.  It was graveyard shift, but it was one of those sites that was always busy because of the local crazies.  This is one of the most memorable shifts I ever had.\n\nMy site was near several nightclubs, so Saturdays were always extra nutty because of all the drunken loonbags misbehaving, muggers mugging, thuggers thugging, etc.\n\nMy partner and I had just started at about 11PM when Surveillance radio'd us to respond to the first floor for a welfare check.\n\nWhen we arrived, we saw something we were both used to.  A sober guy trying to cajole his completely wasted female companion through the lobby to the elevator banks.  The poor girl was a freaking ragdoll and he was having a tough time of it.\n\nOur site happens to have several wheelchairs stashed away to assist residents with these sorts of problems (and/or transport elderly folks when they come to visit).  My partner went to retrieve one and I stayed with the couple, making small talk.\n\n\"Early night eh?\"\n\n\"Yeah, she's done for the night.\"\n\n\"Mhmm, looks like she had fun.\"\n\nThe female opened her eyes slightly and giggled at me, flipped me the bird and slumped further into the male's arms.  My partner arrived with the wheelchair and we sat her back into it, and that's where things began going downhill.\n\nI held the handlebars of the wheelchair steady as my partner knelt down to help put the girl's feet on the footrests.  Suddenly, as if she was possessed, her eyes bulged open and she whirled around to fixate a look of fury upon me before whispering in a demonic voice:\n\n\"I... I *hate* you.\"\n\nBefore I could react, she reached up with both hands and began clawing my face.  I don't remember the next part clearly, but surveillance video showed me snatching up one of her arms and yanking it into an arm bar, flipping the wheelchair on its side as she hit the ground.\n\nWhat happened next I remember vividly.  As she landed on the ground, she kept fighting and clawing.  As my partner wrestled with her flailing legs, she forced her fingers into my mouth between my lower lip and teeth, dug in, and ripped.\n\nI felt no pain.  I was in shock.  I spat out a chunk of crimson tissue and tasted iron.  The inside of my lower lip where it touched my lower canine tooth had been torn out.\n\nThe female rolled over and flopped on her back, looked at the blood running down her wrist and started shrieking, laughing uncontrollably.  I seized her up and slammed her back down and handcuffed her.  She laughed the whole time.  I made sure to double-lock the cuffs.\n\nI stood up, dazed, and realized that blood was now running down my chin.  Fuck.  Uhhhhh... fuck.\n\nMy partner needed no prompting.  He picked up the drunken female by her arms and dragged her (still kicking) away from me, while I stumbled past the tipped wheelchair and into a nearby maintenance closet.\n\nI don't know how long I was there, but during that time, my partner called paramedics for me and cops for the female.\n\nThe paramedics were super nice to me.  I was glad they came so quickly-- I'm sure they were slammed, it being Saturday night and all.  I have a sneaking suspicion that they were glad to be dealing with me, not some transient looking for a hot and a cot.  I tried to be polite in turn and enunciated as best I could.\n\nI was transported to a nearby Emergency Room.  When I stepped out of the ambulance, still dazed, a couple paramedics were standing by the entrance smoking cigarettes.  They must've mistaken me for someone else, because they greeted me happily, asking \"How're you enjoying the ridealong?\"\n\nI gave them a big grin and let all the accumulated blood dribble out my mouth before walking in.\n\nThe hospital was busy and I couldn't have arrived at a worse time.  Saturday night, about 11:30PM and although I got admitted to a room and bed almost immediately, they were severely understaffed.  I later learned that there were only four nurses and a single doctor working; the other doctors and nurses had called out sick.\n\nI sat there quietly by myself for a few minutes when a cop showed up to take photos and notes for his report.  I knew the cop from past interactions-- he was a good guy and at that moment, I couldn't have been happier to see him.  Before he left, he told me he'd ask the nurses to take special care of me, then pulled down his lower lip to show me a gnarly scar of his own (\"I know what you're going through, bro\").\n\nI spent the next six hours literally sitting there swallowing my own blood.  I almost got sick a couple times.  The walls were thin; on my left, a transient complained loudly that nobody cared about him.  On my right, some lady kept sobbing uncontrollably at random intervals.\n\nIt wasn't all bad, although I seriously think I was the only \"normal\" person there that night.  Whatever my cop buddy said to the staff before he'd left must've worked because during my six hour wait (and yes, it was literally six hours), three different (gorgeous) nurses checked in on me:\n\n\"Hey there, how're you feeling?\"\n\n\"I'sdoinokie, thenks yew.\"\n\n\"Would you like a percocet?\"\n\n\"Yesh peash.\"\n\nThis happened several times.  It's like they weren't comparing notes or something, but each time a percocet was offered, I accepted.  I didn't even need water, nor did I dry-swallow the tablets; I washed each one down with a healthy gulp of blood.  \n\nI spent my moments alone reading random Wikipedia articles on my phone.  By the time the doctor got to me, I was high as balls.\n\n\"Whew, look at that.  Yep, you're gonna need stitches.  I'm gonna give you something for the pain first, okay?\"\n\n\"Yesh peash.\"\n\nI got six stitches in my mouth and felt nothing.  It was great.\n\nAfter being discharged at around 6:00AM (with a prescription for more percocet), I took a cab back to my site (to the horror of my coworkers) and finished the last hour of my shift.  I gave my partner a bear hug for covering for me during the ordeal.\n\n\"You... you feeling alright man?  Did you get stitches?\"\n\n\"YUP I FEEL GOOD MAN THANKS YEAH THEY STITCHED ME MAN LET'S ROLL.\"\n\nThe police report would later state that the female that started all this tried to bite one of the cops after she was transported to a (different) hospital.  She was forced to get tested for diseases and came back clean, which I was definitely glad to hear.  The thought of contracting a nasty virus definitely worried me.\n\nI later found out that she worked at a business directly across the street from my site.  She visited my site director the following morning and apparently broke down in tears when she learned what she'd done to me (she had no recollection of the incident).  She said she didn't know the man that had brought her to my site and no criminal charges were filed against her (cops think that her drink may have been spiked earlier in the night).  She did, however, end up settling with me out-of-court on the civil side and I eventually forgave her.  We never determined if the man she was with was a resident at the complex or not.\n\nTo this day, I occasionally run the tip of my tongue along the missing chunk in my mouth.  It serves as a reminder of just how fast a routine call can turn to shit, and to never underestimate any person I contact.\n\nI haven't taken any percocet since that incident.",

        "text": "*This entire story takes place over the course of almost exactly one year.  It is completely true, although certain information has been omitted and/or changed to preserve opsec and the privacy of involved persons.*\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Part I: BigBuyz, Incorporated\n\nBigBuyz is a well-known high end retail chain, with many locations located throughout the United States.  In my city, there are four (that I'm aware of), all in high-traffic areas; its shoppers mainly consist of the upper-class elite.\n\nAs a corporation, BigBuyz is pretty uptight about protecting their wholesome image and keeping the unsavory out of their stores.  In my particular city, crime was already running rampant despite the affluence; local police were usually short-staffed and overwhelmed.  Maintaining a positive front was a delicate task, especially with such a sensitive consumer base.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Part II: The Fall of Thomas O'Malley\n\nThomas O'Malley was a security officer for FleetWorks, one of the largest security contractors in my state.  He was assigned to work at one of the BigBuyz locations in my city, smack dab in an area crawling with drug dealers, addicts and vagrants.\n\nEvery day, O'Malley did his best to maintain a command presence at BigBuyz, shooing away the transients and stopping the constant stream of shoplifters looking for a come-up.  Despite encounters with razor blades, syringes and other violent threats, he did his job as best any unarmed security personnel could.\n\nOne day, O'Malley ejected a homeless man from BigBuyz for the last time.  The homeless man went across the street to his makeshift shopping cart home and retrieved a machete.  He then returned to BigBuyz and proceeded to carve up O'Malley so badly that to this day, he's still out of work, scraping by on disability support.\n\nThe attacker was arrested, charged and eventually convicted.  However, in light of this incident, BigBuyz consumers were up in arms.  How awful!  Something must be done!  How could something so horrible happen at such a pristine retail environment?\n\nSo be it.  From that day forward, all FleetWorks security officers assigned to BigBuyz locations in the state would work fully armed.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Part III: A FleetWorks Experience\n\nA few months after O'Malley was injured, I was hired by FleetWorks to replace him at the same BigBuyz location, working the evening shift.  As I stepped onto my post for the first time, knowing full well the fate of the last officer there, I swore that I'd stay safe and keep out of trouble.\n\nMy duty set-up was an intimidating one, and I didn't mind it at all.  With the reluctant approval of BigBuyz store management, I wore my sharply-pressed tactical duty uniform with pride.  Seedy individuals would eye my duty belt warily, their gazes shifting from the 26\" ASP to the open-top triple mag holder to my faithful [Khaleesi](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/5kuyo9/the_first_time_i_drew_my_firearm/).\n\nThe first few months I worked at BigBuyz, I had a blast, although in hindsight I was lucky to have made it out of there relatively unscathed.  Junkies high on meth would fight me, pulling razor blades, syringes, spitting on me, writhing and struggling to break free of my handcuffs.  My time working at BigBuyz was insane compared to my current job as a non-sworn public safety officer for a local Police Department, but it helped me learn to appreciate the tranquil moments.\n\nOnce it was established among the local hucksters that I was not one to be messed with, they began to respect me.  Some of them would even walk right up to the property line to greet me jovially.  We'd chat away happily and they wouldn't cross the line, knowing that I'd enforce any bans I issued previously.  They became respectful, and I was happy to return the same treatment.  When new junkies would show up in the area, some of the OG's would give them a run-down of the neighborhood, making it clear that BigBuyz was off-limits (\"Aye young blood, if you gon' do some stupid shit, don't do it there cuz security there is coo' as fuck but he don't fuck around wit no bullshit feel me?\").\n\nThe customers were fascinating.  They'd complain to management about my mere presence (\"Are you aware that your security guard has a *gun*?!\"), oblivious to the surrounding neighborhood and the potential dangers.  I found it amusing, and thankfully, store management came to appreciate my presence despite my 'militarized' appearance.\n\nA year flew by and I tendered my resignation at FleetWorks.  I was burned out and looking for something new, something better.  Working at BigBuyz was a great stepping stone, but there was no room for real growth (as is the case with contractors).\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Finale: The End of the Year\n\nFour days after I left FleetWorks and walked out of BigBuyz for the last time, an incident took place at a different BigBuyz location a few miles away from where I'd worked.\n\nA hoodlum local to the area decided to visit this particular BigBuyz, despite being previously banned.  As the store employees looked on, fully aware that he wasn't allowed in, he gathered several items and took them to the checkout counter.\n\nThe cashier informed the thug that he would not be able to make a purchase due to his banned status (and rightly so).  The security officer assigned to that location arrived at that time and began to escort him out.\n\nThe thug decided then that'd be a good time to try to grab the officer's gun.\n\nJust like that, the fight was on.  The security officer whirled around and all but beat his assailant into the tiles.  Once the hoodlum was incapacitated, the security officer dragged him outside and left him laying unconscious on the sidewalk before returning to the store to dial 9-1-1.\n\nA shopper passing by had seen the tail end of the occurrence.  He took a picture of the bloodied thug and posted it on social media.\n\nThe next day, news reports flooded local airwaves: **UNARMED BLACK MAN ATTACKED BY ARMED SECURITY GUARD**\n\nThe fight had started inside the store, where there were plenty of surveillance cameras.  Footage was never released.  Local police conducted an investigation; no charges were filed against the security officer.  The security officer was transferred to another location; local news reported he was fired.\n\nA racial narrative began to take shape, even though the security officer involved was also black (he remained unidentified in news coverage).  Black Lives Matter took to BigBuyz locations, blocking entrances and linking arms around cash registers.  BigBuyz issued a statement condemning FleetWorks and the involved security officer.\n\nHowever, in light of this incident, BigBuyz consumers were up in arms.  How awful!  Something must be done!  How could something so horrible happen at such a pristine retail environment?\n\nSo be it.  From that day forward, all FleetWorks security officers assigned to BigBuyz locations in the state would work completely unarmed.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Epilogue\n\nThe security officer described in the Finale could've been me.  It could've been you.  Never forget that your employer's policies are interpreted and sometimes written by people with absolutely no idea what's effective and what isn't.  This is especially dangerous if they have an obliviously naive attitude regarding the realities of the security industry.  \n\nIn my experience, the best places to work security aren't always the highest paying (although they certainly can be).  When you sign on with a new employer, always review their track record.  Do they back up their personnel?  Do they care about your well-being?  Is that extra dollar an hour worth being thrown under the bus for sneezing?  Do your homework and select an agency that has a good balance of internal support and pay.\n\nSecurity work can be fun, rewarding and fulfilling.  It can also be life changing, and it's not always up to you.  I've gotten lucky many times throughout my career.  I hope you do too.\n\nStay safe, my friends.",

        "text": "So here I am just doing my shift. When suddenly I get a call from a supervisor from the branch office asking me to fill an emergency position. Then I simply said. \"I'm on a shit already.\" Then they are like \"what? Where?\" I told them it's *****. Then they said \"******? Huh... Never heard of that place. Maybe I should just take a look there.\" Sounding so much as if this isn't a real place. So I say... \"Okay.... Bye.\" Uh huh...Alriiiight.... Bye.\" They say so unsure.\n\nSo this site is literally like its own entity. The Branch office has no pull over here because we have our own management, supervisor, and scheduler. The only thing they do for us is just exsist as a branch and pay us. That's it! Yet when they call for stuff like this it raises eyebrows, they run the same schedule system but they never look at it. I love working here, it's the best site we have and it's under great laid back management, even though it's also the strict one as well, plus all the advanced training you need to certify in just to work here. However we keep the client happy, just wish Branch would understand better. They can't simply waltz right in neither, they have no access badge like we do.\n\nJust needed this off my chest.",

        "text": "New here, I don't know why I haven't thought to find a security sub reddit before.\n\nAnyhoo, my site supervisor is repeatedly allowing his \"second in command\" to shoot him in the foot.\nThe turnover rate at my site is horrendous. Because the first shift supervisor has a horrendous attitude. When I was in training on first shift, all I heard about was how the shift I would be assigned to was trash. I went on expecting the worst, but I met some of the coolest people, between my shift and the people who fill in from the other shifts. Site sup and first shift sup constantly pick on and belittle my shift sup, along with anyone they decide they don't like. Why? Because my shift sup has the most seniority of anyone there, and has for a long while. He's been there a lot longer than either of them and his word carries a good bit of weight. Even most contractors and truck drivers that have had to deal with them say they have been belittled by those two. And few to none of the people affected report these things for fear of relatiation (which I know is illegal for them to do, but they get away with so much already.) My shift sup filed a complaint once for a specific occasion, they launched an investigation and all the site sup got was a slap on the wrist.\n\nI was a flex officer when I got called to the site for a full time position, an officer at one of my sites even warned me about this place when she found out I had been approached. I was dumb and just kept hoping what she said was just rumors. Nope. They basically hired me to nark on my shift with talk of having me replace my shift sup. Being an ass to a lot of good people isn't worth the extra chump change. \n\nNow I find myself looking for another job with the rest of the people on my shift and many people on other shifts. Just about everyone who has left in the past two years has cited the first shift sup as a reason for them leaving or for them leaving sooner than intended. It's not the pay, the pay here is higher than I guess the average for this area and company. The site itself isn't bad, the people here are friendly towards us save one or two people. And the rest of us are chill towards each other and get along really well. \n\nI'm sorry I can't give more specific info, but this is bad enough to where I really don't want to identify myself in case shit hits the fan. But when people who have been on site for less than a month are already avoiding these people and are talking about changing sites or jobs... Something is very wrong here. SomeONE is very in the wrong.\n",

        "text": "While the majority of people at one point or another in their careers as security personnel will have some sort of complaint about the job, I can say with certainty that my job sucks.\n\nFor starters, the low pay. Every other site within the company pays their officers a higher salary and have a lot less responsibility. You wouldn't believe the stuff we have to do sometimes.\n\nNext up is the environment and culture of the site. We work contract security for a hospital but are basically hospital employees. Everyone treats us like second-class citizens and seems to purposely make our jobs harder, whether it's misinforming visitors and other staff of policies or going as far as trying to urge us to go after drunk patients trying to drive away.\n\nNext up, the management and supervisors. In management, there's a manager and an assistant manager put there by the company. Again, they're basically assimilated as hospital employees. Any incidents that happen between security and other departments, they will rarely back you up on, unless you're one of their little pets. Then the claws and bared teeth come out. The supervisors are lazy as hell and look for any excuse to get out of working unless it's something that will make them look good towards the higher ups. To top it off there are 2 supervisors with the same rank (Grade 2, highest level a supervisor can get) who are always butting heads for control of the shift. Funny part is one of them only got promoted to that level for kissing the manager's ass so much. The manager basically treats this guy like gold and isn't shy about showing it. The grade 1 supervisors can only watch and be at the mercy of all this bullshit. \n\nGuess I'll end my rant for now.",

        "text": "Don't let the title fool you,  the only race track was the one I set up and used.\n\nI had just gotten out of the Marine Corp and had started college.   The GI bill in the early 80s wasn't the best so I got a job as a night security guard with a major super computer manufacturer in Minnesota.   My post was at a warehouse that was empty from about 6 in the evening to around 7 the next morning and my shift was from 23:00 to 07:00.  They were right up front that nobody would be coming into the building until 07:00 and that the only reason that I was there was because of the savings in fire insurance that they got for having a warm body around.   \n\nNow this building was huge,  about 150 yards long by about 50 yards wide and was filled with ceiling high rack after rack of unidentfiable computer parts.  The workers had three electric golf cart type machines that they used to gather parts when needed.  \n\nOn my first week there I realized that no one came by even to check if I was awake at all.  Bottom line it was just plain boring and there is only so much studying that you can do before going stir crazy.  \n\nSo one night as I was making the ridiculously long walk to check the always locked back door my eye fell on those three golf carts.  Well shoot,  why walk when I could ride?  So I unplug it and head to the back door and quickly realize that this cart actually had a little speed to it.  \n\nOne thing led to another and I soon had a pretty good race track laid out in the warehouse.   After a couple of nights of this I started timing myself to see how fast I could complete my course to the point that I ended up racing the entire night just about every night I was on duty.\n\nAll good things have to come to an end as one morning I had a maintenance man at the door bright and early (cart had already been put away and plugged in).  Asked him what brought him out to the warehouse and his response chilled my adventurous spirit. \"I'm here to replace the batteries in the carts\"  he says \"they don't seem to be recharging over night anymore\". My next night on duty I resumed the slow trudge to that back door every hour on the hour.",

        "text": "So the site I used to work at during my supremely short tenure as a guard was an interesting one. Office plaza with 6 or so addresses all rolled into one building. Attached to a major public transit hub. 24/7 gym. Mostly offices but with a small mall. Food court with 4 or so little restaurants for the office peons or people waiting for connecting trains/buses to eat at.\n\nThe thing about the office tenants is, they're all special snowflakes how demand any/all numbers of security measures in place to prevent \"undesirables\" from accessing their space or really anything. In some areas of the building, security is so tight that there are direct alarms to emergency services that can trigger on *security card passback or tailgating*. Obviously some systems are pretty cutting edge like that, others are like \"what the fuck how is this even still allowed to exist,\" but the point I'm making is that if someone shows up at the security desk, I don't really care how many pizza boxes he's carrying, I'm not going to give him more information than I'd be able to give to a member of the public. If he has a legitimate delivery he should be receiving instructions from the person that works in the office he's delivering to, not from me, unless it's been arranged ahead of time. \n\nNow because this is a story about a particularly horrible food delivery person, I'd like to take just a moment to point out that most couriers are extremely competent, hardworking and professional, very straight forward about what they are trying to get done, and very accepting of what I can and cannot do for them. I've literally had problems with &gt;1% of couriers I've ever dealt with in a security capacity, and most of those were just lost navigating our (admittedly complicated) building. I have myself worked as a food delivery courier for Uber eats, at one point full time, at one point in my spare time, so I'm aware that things may be frustrating at times, however, the best way to get where you're going quickly in a big building is *always* to co-operate with the on-duty guards.\n\nSo I'm on desk duty during a quiet day shift, on or about 1400, when a man in &lt;local chain pizza store uniform&gt; heavily laden with pizza approaches my desk. \n\n**Pizzaguy**: Hey I've got some pizza here for &lt;company with many different, not connected offices in my building&gt;, can you give me a hand on where to find them?\n\nUgh. &lt;Company&gt; has very long term leases on about 12 floors of this building. There's really no telling which of these offices pizzaguy is trying to get to without further information. This company also has no reception aside from a mailroom, where theoretically all couriers should go to, from which mail is routed to the other offices in the building.\n\n**Me**: (courteously explains that the company he mentioned has many offices in the building, and that there's a mailroom I can send him to if he likes, but he'll need to trade me his drivers license/keys for a freight elevator passcard to get to - yeah I know couriers don't always have to ride freight with food but it's all standard site procedure here. I also offer to examine his delivery manifest to see if there's a specific address/floor I can direct him to - there is not.)\n\n**Pizzaguy**: Well can you call &lt;company&gt; and let them know I'm down here?\n\n**Me**: Unfortunately I don't have a contact in &lt;Company&gt; that I authorized to call for these purposes. However your manifest has a phone number on it - I suggest you call that number and get an address and floor number. After that, I can direct you to where you need to go, or even walk you up. \n\n**Pizzaguy**: Can't you call it?\n\n**Me**: (Kind of getting pissed at this guy now, enough to where I'm not going to go out of my way to do his job for him, beyond giving him directions) I'm afraid this is really more your job at this point. If you have an address and floor number I'd be happy to direct you to it, but ultimately with the information you've given me I can't help you.\n\n**Pizzaguy**: Where's your manager?\n\nMy manager's not at the desk at that moment so I give him the business card. Site procedure states that I have to give out that information on request - don't worry, it's literally the front desk number and if my manager doesn't want to deal with an idiot than he doesn't have to. It's not like I rolled over for the guy or anything.\n\n**Pizzaguy**: You're a fucking cunt asshole. (he storms off).\n\nI took a few notes about the encounter and about 5 minutes later my manager ~~The Security Director~~ (Call him this or get bitched out by a dude with rotted out teeth) returns and shooes me away to go patrol. As I am patrolling near the garage exit, the pizzaguy speeds past me flipping me off. Haha whatever, I guess he delivered his shit and he's out of my hair now. \n\nNot 10 minutes later I'm back at the desk as my manager has decided he needs to take an hour-long smoke break, and the phone rings. I pick it up.\n\n**Voice on the phone**: ~string of expletives~ \n\nI recognize the voice - it's the pizza guy! And the moron's name is showing up on caller ID! I quickly take a note of it before telling him not to call back and hanging up on him.\n\nThe guy actually calls back like 5 times to cuss me out. Every time I take a careful note of his name, the phone number, the time of call, what was said, everything, while essentially being polite but curt, and at the first opportunity, informing him that he is not to call back and hanging up the phone.\n\nAfter the 5th time I decide that I'd had enough of his shit. I hang up the phone and dial up &lt;local chain pizza store&gt; after navigating through some menus, I manage to get a human on the phone. He's very interested to hear about what one of his delivery drivers was up to! Since I was able to give him the guy's name and phone number, as well as narrow down the location the driver worked at by giving him the site's address, he says he's able to file a report and escalate it right away. I tell him the company should call back on my personal phone when a solution has been found.\n\nAbout half an hour later, I get a call on my cell from an unknown number. It's the owner of the franchise that the pizza guy worked at. He and I chat for a bit - it didn't sound like he got the full story from corporate so, using my notes, I gave him all the details. I told him that that driver was no longer welcome to deliver to this address (I gave him all 6 of our building's addresses), that we had his face recorded on camera (we did) and that if he was caught calling again or on site, he would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The franchise owner thanked me and hung up.\n\nAnother hour later I get another call from the franchise owner. The pizza guy had actually been let go over it. I actually expected some more harassing calls or for the guy to show up but I guess the threats of legal action I made were passed on and he decided that entertaining me wasn't worth even *more* hassle.
