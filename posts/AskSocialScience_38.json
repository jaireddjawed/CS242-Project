        "author": "PeacefulChaos379",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/5zonym/understanding_the_relationship_between_black/",
        "text": "The actual content of this post will be larger than just the title, but that's the gist of what I'm trying to do here. Specifically, I want to better understand the relationship between black poverty and crime rates, redlining practices (ongoing or in the past), and external variables at play.\n\nI suppose I should begin with what was my very rudimentary understanding of the situation before trying to make sense of all these relationships:\n\nPoverty correlates strongly with crime. Black people have been historically oppressed through institutional racism, with large amounts of black people in poverty. The civil rights movement improved conditions of poverty among black communities, leading to improvements in crime rates. There still exists discrimination on an institutional level, albeit at a much smaller magnitude, resulting in lower social mobility for black people. \n\nAs I said, it's a basic understanding that doesn't really have nuance in it, and it's probably not even entirely correct. I suppose I should begin by asking the following questions: \n\nWhat is it about poverty that correlates with crime so strongly? What factors in poorer communities lead to higher crime rates? The reason I ask is because, despite being the most overrepresented in crime statistics in the United States, black people do not have the highest poverty rates. Native Americans do. While Native Americans also have higher than average incarceration rates, they don't seem to be as high as black incarceration rates. This tells me something that is relatively obvious: there is more to the relationship than poverty and crime, but I don't know what causes this discrepancy. \n\nContinuing with the relation of poverty and crime, I'm also not entirely certain that crime rates among black people have improved since, say, the 1960s relative to white people, even though poverty rates have. That is, I understand that crime rates have dropped, but they have dropped for other races as well. I've been having trouble researching the answer to this question, but have black crime rates remained steadily above white crime rates for the past 70 years or so? (To clarify, what I mean by \"remained steadily above\" is this:\n\nIf black crime rates have been three times white crime rates, it has been that way for the past 70 years instead of improving such that it went from three times to two times. Yes, it may have gone down, but so did white crime rates, and we should expect to see an even greater proportional decrease in black crime rates due to larger decreases in poverty rates.)\n\nIf so, why? \n\nI'm also not certain that if you controlled for income, you would see relatively similar rates of crime among white and black people (because every article I click on makes an opposite claim but never provides a source). Are there any statistics on this?  \n\nSecondly, I'd like to ask about redlining. Whenever I see people talking about redlining, they talk about how it ended in the 1990s, but when I decided to read some Wikipedia articles and look through some papers on Google Scholar, it seems like redlining is a practice still continuing today, and it takes more forms than simply denying mortgage to black people. The issue I've been having is clearly identifying supporting evidence for institutional racism by redlining. By this I mean that, when controlling for other variables such as income or credit scores, there is still a statistically significant difference between races. \n\nI'd also be interested in understanding what aspects of institutional racism result in the high prevalence of single parents in the black population in the United States. I could be incorrect, but it is to my understanding that even when controlling for income, there are still larger proportions of single parents among black people than other races. The factors that cause this aren't immediately obvious to me, but I've seen some explanations that make sense (e.g. U.S. government subsidizing unwed pregnancies incentivized single-parent families). Are there any papers or explanations that delve into this topic a little more? \n\nLastly, I've been wondering why black poverty rates have been stagnating for the past few years instead of improving. Is this because of ongoing redlining practices, some other forms of institutional racism, or something else? What other factors contribute to the social mobility of black people? I'm already aware of discrimination in hiring processes as well as longer sentences for black people in criminal cases, but beyond this I don't really know much.  ",

        "text": "* Sorry in advance for the long question\n\nSome background on why I am asking the question: So recently, a highly-praised feminist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie basically claimed that transwomen are not women or they cannot claim women as a socio-political category. [Here is a link to a news article on the controversy.](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/13/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-clarifies-transgender-comments) She is not being transphobic. I think she is trying to say that while transwomen are a part of the feminist movement, it is problematic for transwomen to claim \"womanhood\". This is an old debate within women/feminist studies and feminist scholars are divided along the structuralist/post-structuralist divide. If we follow a structuralist epistemology, what Chimamanda said is completely acceptable and consistent with a radical feminist theory (patriarchy stems fundamentally from female body parts). If we follow a post-structuralist epistemology, then we can see why many people oppose and disagree with her claim. In addition, most blog posts and activists I read agree with the second option: transwomen are women.\n\nNow I am in a dilemma. I generally situate myself as a structuralist/materialist even though I quite often use post-structuralist tools such as deconstruction in my papers. In other words, if I follow the majority opinion and agree with post-structuralists that transwomen can claim to be women, then implicitly, I agree that Rachel Dolezal (or for the argument, \"transracial\" people) can also claim to be black. \n\nI have thought about this question before (race vs. gender) in my brain back in 2015 during the Caitlin Jenner vs. Rachel Dolezal events. During that time, we also had two professors (a deconstruction sociologist and a political scientist) debate and basically we ended up in the same situation where one was more sympathetic of Dolezal and asked more critical questions about the \"transracial\" category, and the other more firmly declined Dolezal being transracial.\n\nEssentially, the question comes down to whether race and gender are different enough so that transgender is acceptable while transracial is not. And back then, most arguments I heard exclusively focus on how different the two things are **without recognizing how dam similar they are**. I mean, if we look at the classic triforce (class, race, gender), race and gender share a lot of similarities with one another. They are both shaped by historical, social, and political forces. They both decide which group is/isn't privileged. \n\nSome arguments I encountered are:\n\n1. Transgender people are living their truth. Transracial people are deceiving.\nSome thoughts: I think this is a highly phenomenological question. We don't know if Rachel Dolezal actually believes she is black. She made some essentializing modifications (her hairy, spray tan, etc) to her body, but many transgender people also do. There are also evidence stating that she might believe she is actually black. So why do \"we\" dismiss her \"true\" experience as transracial? \n\n2. Transgender people don't experience privilege. Rachel Dolezal, by passing as black, benefited from affirmative action.\nSome thoughts: This argument misunderstands privilege and benefits. Transgender people don't experience privilege under our transphobic system. There is no argument there. However, some transpeople \"are more successful at appearing more closely to the ideal man/woman image\", and they do gain some benefits associated with performing that gender. In addition, I can imagine a situation that a white-to-black transracial person can benefit from affirmative action while suffer through structural (racial) violence since you can't just undo your hair/spray tan in a minute. What I am trying to say that gender and race are both performances (using Butler's idea), so why is okay to perform gender while not for race.\n\n3. Race is dependent on lineage. Gender is not. If I have two white parents, I am going to be white. If I have two white parents, I have ~50% chance to be male or female. Therefore, race is a much more rigid, less-fluid category than gender.\nSome thoughts: this line of argument basically depends on blood politics. And as a social scientist wannabe, I am reluctant to rely too much on biological explanations. \n\nHere is my thoughts right now at this moment: I am wondering if transracial will become more common from now on. Gender/transgender has a long history. So maybe this is why we allow it to be more fluid. Relatively speaking, race is a much more recent invention than gender, and maybe that is why racial categories are more rigid. But with globalization continuing  (unless, you know, if Trumps does something crazy), I am wondering if we need to start thinking about the possibility of \"transracial\" and start theorizing about it. Appadurai's work on St. Patrick's Day and a global Irish identity vaguely resembles what I am thinking.\n\n*I am not defending Rachel Dolezal here. Her actions are very questionable. I just can't sleep because I keep thinking about this question and I really need to get it out of my system! I apologize in advance for any inappropriate usage of words. \n\n\n",

After around 1970 (Khrushchev dies around the same time as the Nixon Shock and the Oil Crisis, so a lot was going on), they enter what Gorbachev apparently call the \"era of stagnation\" and became less and less competitive with the United States.  Why?\n\nDid changes in Soviet Economic policy (of which there were many, notably the [1965 attempts at reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1965_Soviet_economic_reform) were were rolled back in about 1970) affect this growth, or was this economic growth mainly due to capturing the \"low hanging fruit\" of industrialization as the economy became more complex the producers needed signals like prices that the system was incapable of giving?  Or was this gap just the Soviets continued to plan a 1930's industrial economy (lots of steal, cement, fertilizer) and fail to innovate for the post-1970's economy (\"the information economy\", led by new technologies like the microcomputer, and new materials like plastics) and Soviet Central planning fell more and more out of step with the needs of the economy?  I read the [Slate Star Codex review of *Red Plenty*](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/24/book-review-red-plenty/), which has lots of great details about the failures of the Soviet economy, but it left me with more questions than answers.\n\nSimilar things happened in other economies: it seems hard to even imagine today, but North Korea was competitive with South Korea from the Korea War through the early 1970's, perhaps even stronger in some areas, but then completely plateaued, whereas South Korea continues to close the GDP per capita gap (PPP) with the U.S.  People talk about this post-Korean War period of growth in South Korea as \"the Miracle on the Han River\" (modeled after \"Miracle on the Rhine\" economic boom in post-WWII West Germany), but North Korea was growing just as fast for the first twenty years.  Did something happened in global communist economic thought that effected growth rates?",

He at one point calls communist Rosa Luxembourg's economic analysis correct. The conclusions in the three volumes sound like Marx, criticizing capitalism and identifying oppression of the lower class. \n\nI have also noticed similarities between Braudel and Immanuel Wallerstein's \"world systems theory,\" a neo-Marxist approach.\n\nAm I off-base in identifying these similarities? Or is there a real connection here. Does Braudel rely on some Marxist assumptions in his writings. My guess is that if he does, it would have huge implications for how he represented the development of the economy and emergence of capitalism from 1400-1800. ",

The question is, if they had never come, would there be less crime?\n\n[This](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-05-26/davidsonrefugee/2732220) article says that certain African groups are over-represented in criminal statistics but that they are less likely than white Australians to commit crimes because there are far fewer Africans than white Australians, and due to their small numbers this could be a statistical anomaly. Two problems here. One: refuting the notion that 23,000 Sudanese Australians commit more crime than 18 million white Australians seems to be an obvious straw man fallacy. Two: dismissing the statistics as an anomaly seems like a cop-out. It also says that statistically controlling for poverty \"probably\" means that there would be no ethnic correlation, which is pure speculation not backed up by analysis.\n\nIf they had never come, would others be equally poor in their stead and therefore equally disposed to criminality? Obviously hard to answer.\n\nI don't think that immigrants should be deported at all but I need solid arguments one way or another on the question of whether their presence causes more crime, not obfuscatory if well-meaning rubbish. Even if the answer is \"yes, they do commit more crime but we should be compassionate towards them because they have suffered\" then just give it to me straight.\n\n*Also, I read somewhere that in the USA immigrants commit less crime than those born in the USA, so I'm clearly not talking about the USA with your le orange Hitler who wants to ban everyone with non-artificially high levels of melanin but rather about comparatively homogenous societies like Australia or some European countries*",

        "text": "^\\(Previous ^post ^was ^[here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/5v7uks/how_can_repetition_be_nonreproductive_mimesis_v/))\n\nLynda Hart in \"Doing it Anyway: Lesbian sado-masochism and performance\" argues: \n\n&gt;**Mimicry repeats rather than re-presents; it is a repetition that is non-reproductive.** Mimesis operates in the order of the model/copy. Mimicry performs its operations in the realm of the simulacra. \n\nWhat I am struggling with is this difference Hart is drawing between a \"repetition\" and a \"re-presentation\". How can a reproduced thing (an image, a concept, a being) ever be exactly the same (a mimicry rather than a mimetic copy)? \n\nThis difference is also described by Hart as the difference between \"re-semblance\" (the object in question is a copy of the thing) and \"semblance\" (the object in question merely *looks* like the thing).\n\nPart of Hart's argument is that she is warning against falling into this 'great and perfect original'/'inferior copy' dynamic, but isn't there also an argument (...from Foucault? maybe?) that finds that a true copy is impossible, and that the impossibility of perfect copies is a good and hopeful thing because these imperfections are cracks in the hegemonic structure that can be exploited? \n\nDefinitely a part of my confusion here is my discomfort with the intentional de-centering of \"seeing\" that Hart is doing. How can semblance-without-re-semblance be possible in a system that so privileges looking? How is Hart escaping from the classic trap of 'knowing collapsing into seeing'? \n\n---\nHart, Lynda. \"Doing it Anyway: Lesbian sado-masochism and performance.\" *Performance and Cultural Politics.* Ed. Elin Diamond. 48-61. London: Routledge, 1996.\n\nIn this section, Hart is citing Elin Diamond's reading of the third section of Luce Irigaray's *Speculum of the Other Woman* (a reading that finds a system of \"mimesis-mimicry\" repressed by the traditional [patriarchal] mimetic system), Homi Bhabha's theory of colonial mimicry (the colonialist desires \"for a reformed recognizable Other as a subject of difference that is almost the same, but not quite\"), and Deleuze (the simulacrum is \"an image without resemblance\" but \"still produces an *effect* of resemblance\").

        "text": "I originally asked this question of philosophers, but it was suggested that it might fit better here. So:\n\nI had a great biology professor once who put forth a theory that weapon technology shapes the structure of society. For example, in the era of swords and armor, the fact that those weapons were expensive to produce (both in materials and time), and subsequently that only a small portion of the society would be able to be equipped with these weapons, meant that societies of the time would invariably become ones in which those small portions with those weapons would enjoy power and privilege at the expense of those without. Despite the intentions of certain individuals, human nature would ultimately dictate that overall tendency, and invariably shape society to that model. This held true independent of culture or time period (Samurai society in Japan, for example, being an isolate case that demonstrates this).\n\nIn a similar vein, I wonder about the effectiveness of the pursuit of individual calls for us to be 'better people'. I was recently watching the award-winning documentary on OJ Simpson, and thought about how people bought his memorabilia and autographs from him at high prices, even after the trial; even after many in society thought he was a double-murderer. In fact, perhaps because of it. To what extent is that behavior just human nature? To what extent is that due to the unique elements of the structure of our materialistic and celebrity-obsessed society? And to what extent could we hope to mitigate that through simply admonishing people to 'be better' about it? Simply saying 'be better' wasn't going to make lords give up their power to peasants en masse in the era of swords and armor, and perhaps there is something similar at work here? A certain fundamental that simply always wins out over the intentions of some individuals?\n",
