        "text": "About a month ago I got into one of my top choice PhD programs (so exciting!!!) and I’m already starting to feel imposter syndrome…The two advisors I’ve been matched with are absolutely incredible and very respected in their fields. One of them is someone whose work I have admired for years; I often look at their papers and think, wow! I wish I wrote this! This is exactly the kind of work I want to do. Though I am so excited to get to work with them, I’m nervous because I feel so unqualified to work with these incredible professors. I read the most recent paper written by the advisor whose work I’ve loved for years and LOVED it —- I felt like it answered questions that I have been thinking about for a while and formalized theories I’ve informally developed in rigorous and generative ways. But I couldn’t think of what I could contribute to this line of research, how I would expand it; I don’t know if I’m capable of producing a paper like that.\n\nTo add onto this, I only got into one of the 4 programs I applied to. To be fair, I applied to very competitive programs and PhD admissions are always at least a little random/very dependent on advisor fit, and the program I got into is very prestigious, but I still worry about what this means about me. Wouldn’t a really incredible and qualified student get into multiple programs?\n\nI’ve raised this concerns with a few of my mentors from undergrad and they all assured me that I got in for a reason and that I have the rest of my academic career to feel imposter syndrome. But I’m still worried and looking for some extra reassurance.",

        "text": "Context: I am currently a final year undergrad EE student from a top institute in India (top 5 IIT), and I am planning to apply to graduate schools for MS next year. I currently have a software engineering offer from a prop trading firm which isn't that well known outside India, and I am also currently in the process of interviewing with some well-known hedge funds for a Quant Analyst role.\n\nThe issue is the following:\n\n1. There aren't many top tech companies (read FAANGMULA) hiring new grads for SWE roles right now in India. So, getting into them is not feasible for me right now.\n2. The SWE offer from the trading firm is good, but my concern is that the non-existent brand name of the firm while applying for MS can harm my application. Is the concern correct or am I worrying too much?\n3. Quant is kind of a mixture of programming + math, and kind of seems interesting and some good hedge funds had openings for these roles for new grads. If I go via this route, I will surely have a good brand name on my resume, but I am concerned if being a Quant would harm my application for getting into a top CS program.\n\nAcademic Background: I have a decent GPA (9+ on the scale of 10). Haven't given GRE/TOEFL yet. Doing a research project with a professor in my institute and aiming for a publication. Have done multiple industry internships in CS related areas and have multiple projects in CS related areas. Also have done some post graduate level courses in computer science at my college.",

        "text": "I'm posting this because I want people's advice on a simple question: **should I go to grad school?**\n\n**Background (feel free to skip):** I'm mentally ill. I was low-functioning and unhealthy from 17 to 19, high-functioning with unhealthy coping skills from 19 to 21, had 6 months of terrifyingly intense depression, and in the three years since I've been slowly but steadily getting better. I'm taking care of myself, I can work an average of 2 hours (undirected) to 6 hours (with supervision) per day. I have friends, a job, and solid people skills most of the time. On the other hand, while I'm usually functional, sometimes I'm really really not. In almost every job I've had I either got fired or was headed in that direction either because I couldn't do the work in an episode or I turned into an asshole over time. The main problem was that these were menial service jobs, and I hated them and hated myself for not doing better. I'd like to think that that wouldn't happen at something I cared about, but I don't know for sure.\n\n**Why I applied:** I had a very close friend who was applying to grad schools and was tired of me whining about how stuck I was. She offered to help me apply, and apparently I did a pretty good job.  I didn't think I would. I thought maybe it'd be motivated to get a programming job (my previous intended path), I didn't care about money for application fees, and it was better than doing nothing I genuinely TRULY did not think I'd get in anywhere good because I've spent the majority of the last three years lying in bed and my total GPA was 2.97.\n\nBut I did. I got into a really good program. Top 10 in its field.\n\n**Why I want to go:** Because I've spent the last three years doing nothing, and this is a chance to do something. Because it's a field that's really interesting to me, and the best way to be successful is to do something you like with a lot of perseverance. Because I didn't think I could apply, then I didn't think I could get in, and now I don't think I can go.\n\n**Why I'm scared:** Because the average debt for a 2 years master's program is $80,000. I do not have the money to make it much less than that. If I'm REALLY good and REALLY smart with assistantships and whatnot maybe I could get it down to $40,000, less if I only eat rice and beans. But frankly, I'm usually not that good. I have a nightmare that goes like this: I go through grad school, I do my best, but mental illness does its thing and I drop out or get kicked out or can't hold a job after. Then I'm left back where I started with $80k in debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really want to go, but I've failed at a lot of things and this is something with consequences.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I'm open to any suggestions, including deferments, etc.\n\nThanks so much for your time.",

I am hoping to leave the lab with an abundance of technical expertise that will serve me well when applying for a job in biotech, while my PI is more concerned about having a big, imapctful story which I have very little interest in as that will require many more months or years of work that will do little for my resume. I hope to by the end of this year perform assays and analysis that I think will serve me well (proteomics, FACS, library prep, sc/bulk rna seq, simple mouse in vivo) but have little interest in doing more in depth assays to develop the story. In particular my PI has expressed interest in developing a complicated in vivo model that I would very much rather not do, and I think is dissapointed that I expressed limited interest in. \n\nGiven the differences in our outlooks for this project, how can I try to steer this project to what I want from it? Furthermore, what's the best way to approach this conversation with my PI? What can I realistically ask of him and what's the best way to convince him that letting me graduate early / on time is for the best? Thanks for any / all feedback!",

Every week there's an assignment \"due\", but we don't get any feedback because he wants all of them submitted as a single document at the end of the semester. Other than that the only grades are two quizzes, two exams, and a final project. I'm currently trying to review for the first quiz but can't because none of the linked documents on the class page will open. The instructor hasn't responded to my email about this yet. Overall just a frustrating experience, and if one of your classes switches to asynchronous just drop it and take something else.",

My background is in the natural sciences and I've got several years of TA experience in the same classes at my alma mater, but I'm worried the professor / reviewer of the application is going to see that I'm a law student and discard my application before they get to the relevant parts. I want to include as much material as possible to prove that I'm qualified to TA this class, but I can't figure out where to draw the line between important and excessive information. I've contributed to several academic publications in the general field I intend to TA in, and have self-published a few non-academic publications on the same topic. Do any of these seem like they're worth leaving off a resume for a TA position?\n\nFor what it's worth, the class is Ecology.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.

Poster presentation I authored and presented at a conference in a different life sciences field (herpetology)\n4. Undergraduate thesis which was a self-published book on the same life sciences field\n5. Undergraduate final paper (for ornithology), which I ended up self-publishing as a PDF and that became required reading for the class thereafter\n6. Several papers where I contributed illustrations / am mentioned in the acknowledgements (this feels like a stretch)\n7. An official government report in a humanities field (archaeology) that I authored an appendix for\n\nThanks for any advice! I'm obviously a generalist and don't have the single-minded focus on the subject I'm worried they're looking for, so I just want to avoid making a fool of myself.",

For reference I have fibromyalgia, endometriosis, ADHD, and pretty severe depression so motivation is not my forte when I’m “healthy”, much less currently. \n\nI went back to school in 2018 to finish my bachelors and worked myself to the bone to get into my dream grad school.

I spent a year there before realizing I wanted to change paths as this degree wouldn’t allow me to continue working with my clients in the capacity I want, and enrolled in another grad program this past fall. \n\nI am just worn out. I know I’m burnt out. But I can’t drop any of these responsibilities and I just feel stuck. Without grad school I will pretty much top out in my field and have no upward mobility to ever make more money or have an easier life. \n\nI have a paper due plus other assignments and I literally cannot muster a single ounce of motivation.

I started with a very daring project that hit a wall, i felt like I was basically doing and troubleshooting PCRs for four months. \n\nIn the next stage my PI and I decided that it would be right to change my project, I'm now doing something else but still feel like it's very minor and basic. Some flow cytometry, microscopy and mostly bacterial culture handling and gene editing. I still have a way to go, get over some hurdles and work it out before I can say this project hit a wall too but I feel that what ever I do on this project is very basic and doesn't excite me or feel like it's worth wasting time on.\n\nI always wanted to get more into bioinformatics but I feel like my lab doesn't focus on bioinformatics enough to have anyone that can really support this path, and working it out by myself feels like a huge waste of time where most of the time I'm troubleshooting and trying to install and use tools that never work.\n\nDo you think these feelings of being a very minor cog, or just learning barely enough - are normal and happen during a masters?\nOr is it possible that I've just chosen a wrong masters lab for me?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and suggestions if you have any",

I’m not sure if it would be a good idea for me to put my career on hold to do the masters. I don’t know if I would want to be a SWE and code everyday for a living. However, learning computer science seems like an indispensable skill to have in the upcoming decade and I am open to learning and gaining technical skills as my undergrad degree is in social sciences. Would love to get your input on whether it would be a good idea to go into the program solely to gain a new skill and I would most likely look for a non-coding job in tech after, or if I should just stick with the job I have currently. \n\nAnd the reason why I applied for a masters instead of doing courses on course era or something is because I figured having a degree from a recognizable institution would better validate my skills. \n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "I am scheduled to complete my Master of Computer Science (MSCS) degree in May, although my GPA stands at 3.2. Looking back, I believe I struggled in many of my classes because I lacked a solid foundation of knowledge. At one point during my degree program, I considered dropping out, but I had already invested a significant amount of time and money and decided to continue anyway. This turned out to be a huge mistake. My original goal was to pursue a PhD in Information Science/Human Computer Interactions after my Master's degree, but given my current GPA, I feel as though that may no longer be possible. I know I should be happy about my upcoming graduation, but I just feel so lost and uncertain about my life. Where do I go from here? What are my next steps? Do you have any advice for me?",

        "text": "I recently graduate with my honours degree and decided to move abroad to gain work experience before pursuing my masters.\n\nMy relationship with my thesis supervisor was strained; she was notoriously bad at sticking to deadlines, low support, and had a very passive aggressive communication style. Her PHD students shared my difficulties (them moreso) so I know this was a consistent thing.\n\nMy current dilemma; I emailed asking if she was still comfortable being an academic referee for me before I began applications (she previously said yes in November when I asked).\n\nHer answer was that she was on extended leave and it was no longer possible, and that supervisors aren’t referees for non-academic positions. The positions I’m applying for involve research and I worked as a research assistant underneath her during my own dissertation.\n\nWas I out of line for asking? Despite everything, I worked hard and achieved a first class degree and dissertation.\n\nAre supervisors only referees for post-grad applications as she was not officially my employer?\n\nThanks for thoughts! This is my first time navigating this kind of situation.",

        "text": "I was meeting with mg PI today in his office and he came around his desk to sit in the chair next to me and show me a calculation. I was looking at his paper and noticed he… smelled good? So I may have breathed in a little extra long. And then I realized what I was doing and turned bright red and didn’t make eye contact for like 2 minutes afterward as we finished the calculation. Now I’m like crap, does he think that I like, like him now? (I’m a 23F and he’s like 50 and married, for reference) I’m super embarrassed. I’m overthinking this, right? Like he probably didn’t notice and it’ll just brush over. I’m just embarrassed and needed to vent.",
