I'm currently a freshman in college and trying to decide between Math or Computer Science, however the CS program at my university is extremely difficult to get into, and I doubt I would get in even with the years of experience I currently have. Either way, if I were to graduate with a degree in math and have years of coding experience, would it be likely to get a job within the computer science field? thanks in advance :)",

        "text": "So on another sub, there was a thread about queues, specifically the FIFA World Cup one. A Redditor made it clear that people saying it is/should be built with web sockets are a bad idea and shouldn't be done. I asked him to elaborate, and it just made me feel dumb, I couldn't really wrap my head around what he was saying or make sense of it.\n\nI was just wondering if anyone else can make sense of what he was trying to say, or if i'm just being dumb. Either way, a simple expiation or link to any good resources about the topic would be appreciated.\n\n Redditor\n\n&gt;This  is a queue. It may have nothing to do with server capacity as some  transactions take a few minutes to run through. You don't want bots to  fire up sales. User needs to be in line, has an open spot. Then choose  their seats, pay. A bot would just fire of 10,000 requests and pick up  whatever is available.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Has nothing  to do with infrastructure or server capacity. I had to do this for a  parking lot for a popular venue once. You had to open the slot time  window. User has to say what size car they had. SUVs take up more space.  Check the incoming queue then allocate a spot.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Same  thing with flu vaccine booking. If you every built a site that had  40,000 or 100,000 people at the front door, you don't want a stampede.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And  no websockets is not the answer. You can open up a socket and if the  person has 3 sessions (browsers) up so they can start their order 1st,  that means 2 others are not in the queue and causes a lot of pissed off  people.\n\nMe\n\n&gt; Not following with your last bit about web sockets, from what I can  attempt to make sense of, your saying it prevents people from connecting  multiple times? But that’s a good thing no ? \n\nRedditor\n\n&gt;There  are some comments suggesting to use websockets which is NOT the  cure-all. Websockets is used as a full-duplex, two-way communication  from server to client (browser). E.G. If there is an open slot  available, the server will push notify awaiting web browser and user to  respond. This doesn't solve the inherent problem of bots waiting and  filling up all the connections; awaiting their chance to buy all of  Taylor swift concert tickets. Someone can easily spool up 50,000 bots on  AWS lambda to saturate a bunch of websockets in 5 minutes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A queue can use sockets but it will tell the users that hey,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"in  20 minutes, you have a 15 minute window book say an an appointment with  a doctor. You have to actually do something or have this window open  until that booking is available as others are making their selection.  Then you get 15 minutes when your time is ready.  We expect 20 minute  wait but if someone ahead of you finishes before you, it can be 12  minutes. So just keep an eye on the counter as it goes down.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That  15 minute will give you 5 open slots on different days and we will   hold the reservations those spots from other patients while you have  that 15 minute window to decide. Once you make your appointment, 4 slots  go back into the queue. Same thing can happen for venue seats. But  simply saying \"websockets\" is the solution is not a complete answer.  As  you can just leave, go to lunch, BRB and that 20 minutes moves up to 3  minutes as the people of you happen to be very quick that day. The  visual queue helps the users.\n\nMe\n\n&gt; Ok so you would send requests on a interval to see if the users is  allowed to enter ? I also don’t see how not using sockets prevents bots,  they can join the queue with or without sockets right ? \n\nRedditor\n\n&gt;You  never do intervals if it is a real queue. If your queue is 20 people at  a given time with each having 5 options. You withold 100 spots and  subtract 5 for each time a single person finishes. Some users may take 4  minutes, others 30 seconds.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That  is how a real queue works. Bots would have to be smart enough to do  random selections, random interaction to make sure each transaction is  varying in time like real user(s). Furthermore, bots would have to join a  queue and if that queue is more than 30 minutes, it needs to internally  keep its own internal session alive. So how would it do that? poll  itself so it's session doesn't time out. Most python bots run like what 5  minute sessions? Managing an internal session for the bot means the bot  maker is spending money on compute resources if it a bot farm. They  can't spool up and spool down serverless functions that require  persistent session. They have to spend more money.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When  would it know to continue the queue? Run an interval itself. I am bot, I  will ping myself to keep myself alive. Then ping the server to see if  the random notifcation I coded to &lt;div id  \"availability-12dfsdf3\"&gt;queue #&lt; /div&gt; still exist. But what, I  now see \"spot-in-line-443242\" Is that a real link? Wait, that div is  not align to the parent div I was coded to backup look for. Or how do I  continue? A good queue designer would randomize the layout where  \"scrapeable\" things that are bots are trained for will be so randomized,  it would be difficult.",

For example, instead of having a separate instruction for both integer addition and subtraction, the complier can just convert the number that is subtracting to a negative, then do addition on the two numbers instead. 5 - 8, for instance, can be converted to 5 + (-8). For more complicated operations like the ones mentioned in the title, how does the OS or complier convert this to a series of primative instructions that the processor can then read?\n\nAnother example that I hope illustrates my question is a scientific calculator, any regular one you can buy from the store for $20. Its CPU is relatively simple, and I'm assuming it wouldn't have dedicated units for complicated mathematical operations. How does this device break complex expressions into simple instructions?",

What does the encoding step do for JPEG compression? The way i understand it based of reading JPEG compression steps, is that it is an additional layer of lossless compression. Now I’m fine with understanding it as that, but why do some codes ([link](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~web6140/TopTenAlgorithms/JPEG.html)) discard the results of the encoding step, and present only the resulting image after being quantized, but before being encoded. An additional question for this is that would Huffman encoding work alone as a way to compress an image?\n\n2. Why do diagrams and codes reverse the steps after encoding? I’ve read papers and skimmed codes and noticed some of them include reversing the operations performed on them. Isn’t the image already compressed, why are there some that include reversing the steps, is it part of the compression as well? If so, wouldn’t it be useless for lossy compression such as JPEG compression as data was already lost in the first half, why would you try to retrieve it again.\n\nThose two main things are the most confusing stuff i’ve been facing, as the encoding step gets ignored, (and was only used to get the length of the file for the example link  i gave), and some code and diagrams discuss what i would call decompression when the topic is image compression\n\nThank you!",

Problem is that even with a basic knowledge of C, there is still a bunch of unknown terms and concepts. From my research I could only find very professional docs, or simple articles explaining what physical computing is in general. What I am searching for is sort of a *demystifying* guide, which helps one get started and know how to search when needing to know more. A good example of what I am searching for would be the [Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/), which goes into deep concepts, but explains them in a simple and understandable way. Anyone has anything like that? \n\nIf you're confused on what I mean by low-level physical computing, then making a library for a ssd1309 display would be an example, where setting it up needs you to understand the machine code underneath.",

The Summer internship is with Infosys as a SWE intern (I am looking for other internships for the summer, but I immediately accepted to ensure I have something at the very least. They, as well as my state, are at-will so I will not be held responsible for reneging on the offer). I have other prospects I am currently pursuing (clearly I don't want to work for Infosys), but I am in different stages of the application process so I am still waiting. \n\nMy questions are as follows:\n\nIs the spring internship working fory states legislative branch's technology department as a business Analyst Intern a good role/be looked at positively?\n\nAre government IT roles looked at as positive experience from other companies in the IT industry?\n\nI've seen a lot said bout WITCH companies, is it really that bad?\n\nIs it bad to have a WITCH job on your resume?

Whatever you do, make sure it’s something that will make the birthday girl or boy feel special on their big day.\n\n**How to make a birthday wish?**\n\nWhen it comes to making a birthday wish, the options are endless. You can go the traditional route and simply say \"Happy Birthday!\" or get creative and write something more personal. If you're looking for some inspiration, here are a few ideas:\n\n\\-Wish them a happy and healthy year ahead.\n\n\\-Send them your love on their special day.\n\n\\-Tell them how much you appreciate them and everything they do for you.\n\n\\-Let them know how lucky you feel to have them in your life.\n\n\\-Reminisce about the good times you've shared together and look forward to many more in the future.\n\nNo matter what you choose to say, simply conveying that you care will make all the difference. So take a moment to think about what would mean the most to your loved one on their birthday, and let those words guide your wish.\n\n**Birthday wish examples**\n\n1. \"Wishing you all the happiness your birthday can hold! Have a wonderful day!\"\n\n2. \"Sending you lots of love on your special day!\"\n\n3. \"May your birthday be as beautiful and joyous as you are!\"\n\n4. \"Wishing you a birthday that's as wonderful as you are!\"\n\n5. \"Hope your birthday is as amazing as you are!\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOn this special day, I want to let you know that you are the best sister in the world and that I am so happy to have you in my life. I hope your birthday is as wonderful as you are and that all of your dreams and wishes come true.

        "text": "I won't go into details but for some reason I am studying CS in a non reputable university. Most people may not even know the name of it where I live. I also can not transfer anywhere else.\n\nI'm in my 2nd year and so far I think I've taught myself very well. I'm learning from MIT's, Stanford's courses instead of from my professors. If these kinds of great schools do not have video courses of the class I'm taking, then I get the same book they are using and study from there. My classmates are almost all pretty much non-interested and not that intelligent. I'm trying to be at the same level as one of the schools I mentioned by teaching myself.\n\nI feel depressed when I go to school because most people there are basicly idiots who are just there to party or sth. So, I do not attend any class that is not mandatory and only attend the midterms and finals from those. My GPA is above 3.5/4.\n\nI am looking for encouragements and and truth from you guys. I do feel pretty depressed because I do not belong here but if there is nothing I can do to go anywhere else... I must do my best with the 2 years of school I have left.\n\nI'm hoping to work in a job with better and more qualified people and in a respectable company when I graduate or a couple years later at least.\nBut so many people just say that... no no no, you can get a good job from a bad university. There will always be so many people from the best top schools in front of you and you can never beat them. I know my chances are slim, but I'm really trying my best.\n\nWhat are my chances?",

I really like programming and everything related to it, but I don't see the point and purpose of doing programming for a long time. I always started and gave up everything after a maximum of half a year. Then I took a break and then for some reason I started to dive into programming again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iu7vfu0tq92a1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e4e8c8bad4bc7aba944d4a2b1e54c6923d2410b\n\nI'm fixated on programming and I can't consider other areas of activity because of this. It seems to me that I can realize myself only in the field of IT, but in my subconscious I understand that I will not be able to do this, although I have a great interest. Because of this, apathy and meaninglessness of life become more and more acute for me every time. I can't figure out what to do.\n\nEarlier, when I was just starting to study programming at university, I had some goals, there was a misconception that I associated myself with IT for life, but over time I began to understand that I did not want (or do not understand why) to spend my whole life at the computer. Perhaps I would like to erase all knowledge about computer science, but now I have driven myself into a trap where I actually like the field of programming itself, but I don't understand why I should do it, and because of this I can't do something else. It seems to me that other fields of activity are \"bad\", that I will not be able to realize myself in them and there is a slight fear of choosing something wrong again and fixating on it as now with programming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought I could force myself to do programming just for the money, but I was deeply mistaken. It didn't give me any motivation, although I understand that this job can provide me.\n\nTell me how you can completely rid yourself of thoughts about programming and stop wasting time on it, or how to motivate yourself and make sense to do programming in the long run.\n\nI have been standing in one place for almost 3 years, in apathy and constant depression. Sometimes I tell myself that programming is actually what I would like to do, but I have enough for a maximum of a couple of months and then I quit again and get depressed. I don't understand how I can get rid of this. It is very difficult when something is very interesting in theory, but in practice it turns out that there is no desire to do this for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope someone will understand me. I'm not really sure that I explained the situation correctly. Perhaps someone has been in the same situation and will be able to give me some ideas.",

I thrive trying to create a data structure that will save me 1Byte per element, making a custom memory allocator to increase locality, or parallelizing in weird ways to make use of every little performance my CPU can give me. I have basic experience with CUDA too (which is fascinating in my opinion), but I have a hard time finding interesting projects to use it with.  \n\n\nSo basically, I want to explore new things to program that aren't related to game engines (Don't get me wrong, I love it) but can give me these things. Any ideas? I'm mainly looking for very logical projects (with this I mean things that don't require me to spend 90% of the time learning APIs, specific platforms or frameworks, but rather something that is more purely just coding interesting logic).   \nI don't mind things bei8ng math heavy, I like it.",

        "text": "Not sure how much this question is CS vs CE/EE but since there is a lot of overlap and I couldn't find a sub like this for CE this seemed like the only choice.\n\nThere's 2 things I've been considering when it comes to us being able to improve performance less and less as time goes on:\n\n1 – It's the hardware. We don't currently have the means to reduce heat enough to make hardware get better and better, and we can only remedy this if we find an adiabatic solution to designing computer hardware.\n\n2 – Hardware limitations aren't the main problem, software is. We're getting to a point where designing software that's optimized/well-designed enough to take advantage of modern hardware is taking an imptactically high amount of man-hours, skill, and coordination. The supply of extremely talented/skilled software engineers is far too low, and it's likely to only get worse as time goes on, plus the logistics/coordination required to improve accuracy/performance only gets more and more unrealistic.\n\nThese both make sense to me but I also have no idea if either of those are the case. I'm not an electrical/computer engineer so I'm not very well-versed on the subject, I'm just starting CS in college and since I like both games &amp; physics/chemistry related sciences a lot this came up in my mind.\n\nIf the future had it in store, I would definitely want to be someone who makes realistic simulations of evolution, chemistry/biochemistry, or classical physics &amp; astrophysics, or even combine them. But I don't think that's actually something I'll live to see the day of being reality for lmao, unless we actually invent/innovate something like organic transistors, or quantum computers, and have super-intelligent AI able to do a lot of the programming for us.\n\nthe rest of this became a big elaboration instead of a question so you can safely ignore it\n\nI want to work in ML/AI or Big Data, whether I do Science or Engineering is a matter of what the job market holds for me, so maybe I'll be the one that makes the tools people use in 100-200 years to make this lmao. Assuming the consequences of greedy politics don't kill us, that is...\n\nI would totally work in quantum computing but that takes an incredibly high amount of talent and skill that I simply don't think I'd be enough for, my ADHD+Dyspraxia+Anxiety would kill me. I also have aphantasia, which normally could even be a benefit in mathematics (including CS) but only because it generally strengthens your descriptive/working memory and perception – having ADHD kind of counteracts that haha! I'm suuuper interested in... microsciences? And stuff that has to do with evolution/change over long periods of time. Plus stuff to do with living being research. Like particle/quantum physics, biochemistry, evolutionary biology, astrophysics, psychology (mainly in relation to genetics/chemistry/evolution), geography/geology over the span of billions of years. Also thermodynamics &amp; fluid dynamics just because of how important yet underdeveloped the fields are (presumably because they're very difficult). All of these would be extremely cool to work in, specifically making simulations them &amp; making predictive models.\n\nMy dream job would be making interractive simulations of concepts in complex fields for people in the general public to use and either learn off of, or make practical inventions/products with. Simulations of chemistry, of evolution of life, of genetics, of electricity &amp; thermodynamics, of classical mechanics (especially in the context of engineering buildings &amp; roads, like simulating stress and forces acting upon them), and of how fluids interract with everything around them (e.g. how they can be used to make electricity), all of those especially pique my interest.\n\nIdk why I mentioned all that stuff but the point is I don't even know if computers will be powerful enough to do all of that accurately within the next 50 years. I've read up on a lot of similations of the universe, plate tectonics, etc. from the start to future end of history that apparently have pretty good accuracy.",

Just wanted to not be alone so this is a rant like post but just wanted maybe how you guys kept pushing or what made you keep going. I personally love computers and am very interested! It's just these moments or my advisor saying I need straight A's adding on to the feelings I get. Thank you for reading this.",

Now, in a sequence of n increments, a single increment could cost as much as n (actually 2n − 1) \"  \nwhy its actually 2n-1 ? I feel like Im missing \"basic\" stuff here  \nif we look at 000  \nto flip A\\[2\\] (the leftmost digit)  \n001  \n010  \n011  \n100  \nand it took us 4 times  \nis it because in the accounting method we consider each inceremnt as cost of 2?\n2. in general the potenial method is a bit \"heavy\" for my understanding, Im having trouble understanding how to know what potenial function to give, I find it a bit hard to find examples online (mostly find the same 3/4 examples in every place)  \nif someone has reccomendation where to read/see examples would love to hear(trying to read through clrs, but I feel like I need to see more examples of how to come up with potenial function, especially with O(log n) and O(n\\^2)\n\nsorry for any mistakes / misspelling or using the wrong terms",
