In fact I have realized there is so much content in regard to learning a new language online it has become very overwhelming. \n\nWith that said I really want to learn spanish. Here is some information about me:\n\n* \\-English native\n* \\-Lived in central america for awhile, but it was years ago and my spanish basics have dwindled to nearly nothing. I can barely understand the context of a spanish conversation.\n* \\-I am a visual learner\n\nI know there are a thousand posts in regard to learning spanish. So I apologize for any repetition. But what I am looking for is opinions on a **schedule**. \n\nIf I dont make this a schedule I will never do it. \n\nSo this is what I am looking for:\n\nI am considering a online tutor for once a week. \n\nWhat materials would you suggest that is reasonable for daily consumption for 1- 2 hr study every day?\n\nFor example:\n\nWhat books would you suggest i read to start / finish, how frequent should I see a tutor, any paid online services worth it that will supply everything? Any supplementary apps you would suggest that are actually beneficial ? \n\nI cant currently LIVE in a spanish speaking country, however I have friends who speak fluently so I can definitely practice with them.\n\nI have been reading a ton of reddit posts, but its just so many different things I am lost in the sauce and dont know where to start.\n\nThank you all so much for reading and considering my post.",

Then I've drastically changed my career, and never used them for job.\n\nNow, I don't know what to do with this situation. \n\nFrom one side, I spent a lot of time on it. These languages are considered important by people, and it feels cool to claim that I \"know\" them, even a bit. Also, I've learned to recognize a beauty of different languages, so it's not like I consider the languages themselves boring or ugly.  \nFrom the other side, I'm not really a fan of the countries or cultures linked with these languages. One of them doesn't keep me interested enough for some reasons, and as for another I started feeling a great disconnect with it and really hating it.\n\nSo, now I have three choices. I can drop these languages completely. Or I can spend a couple hours in a week just to keep them \"on life support\". Or I can make an effort and raise my level in them in hope that I will find more interesting things if I'll be more fluent.  \nWas anyone in a similar situation? What did you do?",

During the first ten years of speaking/learning Spanish, native speakers often remarked that I had a very good accent and that they couldn't perceive a strong American accent (I'm from the US). I got this compliment all the time. It's quite possible that it was undeserved.\n\nI got married to a Spanish speaker and Spanish became the sole language of our home even while living in the US. I also begin to use Spanish for work. Since that time I have often been told that I speak like a gringa and I have a very strong American accent. I now live in Peru and I get told that even more.\n\nI'm totally willing to believe that this is true. It's just surprising that my accent has gotten worse with time and speaking the language more. Is this an existing phenomena? Has anyone else experienced this? Is it possible that by spending hours a day speaking a language, it's hard to maintain an accent. Any possible explanations. I'm so intrigued by this and would welcome input. Thank you!",

I am wondering, how did they forget the language? One theory in my head, is Writing a language, really permanently keeps a language in your head. I feel it's harder to forget, especially if I read a novel or internet/online newspaper once a week (when I get to a good point). My speaking is okay, I've always been more of a written learner vs oral learner.

For those who don’t know, for the year 2023 we are all collectively going to be reading one book in our target language each month. \n\nThe purpose is to continuously be supporting of one another and encourage ourselves to strive our goals. The length or level of the book doesn’t matter, as long as it’s completed before Feb 1st. I think we can all check in every 2 weeks or so to see our progress and assure that we’re sticking to it. \n\nThis is my first time ever doing this so everyone please bear with me. The first day starts tomorrow technically (Depending on where you are) so if everyone could list their 1. TL(s) 2. First book for Jan and 3. Goals for the challenge; It would be greatly appreciated! Good luck and Happy New year everyone :^)",

On one hand, someone might aim for something that’s close culturally (e.g. someone from France learning Italian or German), because it’s somewhat familiar, they can see the potential with travel opportunities (being nearby), and there’s something of a shared experience being a part of western Europe together. Or perhaps they would go to the other end of the spectrum, learning something completely unfamiliar like Malayalam, because it would open themselves up to a whole new world and way of thinking, even if they can’t envision themselves ever going to Kerala. Maybe some people like to find a balance, a culture to explore with some familiar aspects, but not too close (maybe Turkish or Russian for that French person).\n\nIf cultural exploration plays a part in why you learn a language, in what role does the familiarity of the associated culture play a role for you? For me, I feel like I’ve been too focused on envisioning myself realistically traveling to a place where the language is spoken, places that are in my “comfort zone” so to speak, and maybe that’s been limiting me to the languages of the Americas and western/northern Europe, which feels a bit, idk, limiting?",

        "text": "Ok.. So I’ve reached a point in my near lifelong journey of learning Polish, that if I say simple sentences to people, they often think I am a native speaker.\n\nMy accent and grammar is just good enough that strangers do not think “oh this is some american dude trying to learn polish and he’s pretty good, wow how impressive!”\nI believe it’s more like “wow this fellow polish dude is kinda stupid and not very well spoken”\n\nAnd I have tested this by deliberately starting interactions with a heavier american accent, or in english, and then transitioning into my (pretty good) polish, and I’m always met with smiles, and “your polish is impressive!”\n\nVersus, starting off trying my best, I inevitably make multiple minor grammatical mistakes, and I speak a little slower than a natural native, and usually the reaction is a mix of impatience, frustration, and like a little… disgust?\n\nI can of course always start with a heavy accent or throw in a “Przepraszam jestem z stanów i uczę się Polskiego” (Sorry I am from the US and I’m learning Polish) But like every interaction? Checking out at a grocery store, buying train tickets, ordering food… gets tiring\n\nAnybody in a similar situation?? I don’t really know what to do haha, except wait and try and get better? But I feel like I won’t progress much more than where I’m at, without moving here full time for multiple years.\n\n\nTLDR: I’m right on the threshold of language skill where natives think I am just a shy, stupid person, instead of somebody who’s learning lol",

        "text": "Learning a new language Could be seen as an Impossible challenge. Despite that, from how I learned English, it seemed like trying a new drink that other people have tried. Some might say it is refreshing to try it. Others might say it is not good whatsoever. Also, you have the “nay Sayers” that always have negative opinions even though they did not try it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLearning English was quite a challenge for me when I was younger. But, once I got the hang of the language in my last year of high school, it changed into acquiring it instead of learning it. I started to get better quickly. All I had to do was surround myself with the language it was like a big boom. I went from memorizing words to watching English video creators on YouTube. Then I figured out that this could work for almost everyone. All you need to do is watch content in the language you want to learn/acquire based on your interests: science, sports, politics, or even video games. You might notice that you hear words repeated and get that feeling that you want to know what that word is. Bit by bit starts turning into a snowball that is getting bigger rapidly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion, just watching content in that language is not enough. Looking for the basics of the language and reading about them is essential. Finding a native speaker of the target language who speaks your language or opposite who does videos on how to learn might help you majorly. I should note that this is not a quick and easy way, but a good one that could help to get going. Also, it could familiarize the culture more. I should point out that this is not a quick way, but a better way to get started or quickly improve your knowledge of the target language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, learning a language should be done with a mindset of a kid listening to his parents and other people speaking it. If you listen (also read) to speakers of the target language is an astronomically excellent tool that should help you get to the point you want.",

        "text": "Context, I’m a native English speaker that has moved to Japan for a year as an exchange student. I started studying Japanese around March this year and it started off well even though it’s obviously very difficult and very different from English and then I moved here in October. But this past month my motivation for learning it has completely gone out of the window. Many exchange students dropped the Japanese class I take because they didn’t see the point in learning a language they’d only use for a year. This made me question why I’m still carrying on with it since can’t really see a situation where I’ll come back to Japan other than for tourism. \n\nOn top of this, I’m usually only in contact with students, who want to practise their English, or people who already have quite a high level of English in the first place. Even if I try my Japanese, I’ll probably just get English spoken back to me. It’s understandable, but it’s still frustrating as my speaking is awful compared to my listening/reading/writing due to lack of practice.\n\nOn top of this, I feel like I’ve only been met with discouragement. The learning community just seems elitist and toxic. My friends just laugh at me if I try to speak it, one of them even just outright tells people I don’t speak Japanese at all, which means people switch to English. I also don’t really consume much Japanese media, like anime or J-pop, so it’s not even worth learning it for that. \n\nThe only reason I haven’t stopped yet is that I talk to my Japanese friend over Line (messaging app). If I gave up, I wouldn’t be able to speak to him, and I feel he’d be disappointed. I also really want to know a second language as it’s always been a dream of mine. \n\nThis post was mainly just to gather my thoughts into one place. But I was also wondering if anyone had a similar situation or if anyone had advice to get better at speaking without talking with other people. I really want to carry on learning and to get better, but nobody wants to talk Japanese with me and I’m slowly starting to loathe the language because of this.",

I am quite proud that I met all of my goals for 2022 -\n\n-Listened to 305 hours total of Spanish (podcasts, YouTube, shows)\n-Talked in Spanish for a total of 30 hours (i suppose i could add that to the listening total, but i separate it for whatever reason) \n-Read a couple books, including Harry Potter 2 + 3 and Los Juegos Del Hambre. \n\nI want to raise my goals for 2023 just a hair, but keep them realistic. I'd like to be more consistent - in 2022 i had some months where i listened to 3 hrs per day, but there were some months where i listened to 3 hours in a week. So my goals for 2023 are:\n\n-Listen to a total of 365 hours of comprehensible input (ideally 1 hour per day)\n- Talk for 39 hours total\n- Read 1000 pages\n- Do anki, try to add 5 new cards a day, but don't stress about it \n\nAll of that explanation was simply to keep myself accountable and write down my goals. Now for the advice i am requesting: how do you guys get listening content? Previously i focused on Spanish learning podcasts like Españolistos, No Hay Tos, Hoy Hablamos, How to Spanish, and Learn Spanish and Go, but i am really running out of interest in them. I am having a hard time finding other interesting content i can actually listen to 1 hour per day of. Audiobooks? Radio? Idk\n\nWe have a baby due in 2023, so this might all go out the door when the new arrival comes, but i figure i can give it a shot! 😂",

I’m currently learning Polish with a bunch of workbooks and videos. \n\nI’m really scared though. I have so many languages I want to learn, and while I know learning a language as an adult isn’t *impossible*, We watch videos all the time in Spanish class about how we made a good decision by learning Spanish at this age because if we were any older, we would never be fully proficient and would have to think too hard about what we’re planning on saying. \n\nThat idea freaks me out, which is why I’ve been spending my entire break learning Polish, 4 or more hours a day. If I have to learn it before I’m 18, then I better work quickly, right? But I have so many languages I want to learn, with Russian being my next after Polish because they’re somewhat similar but it’d be an introduction to a new alphabet (plus we have a lot of Russian speakers around here), and then some other language, I’m thinking Gujarati but I’m not sure. There’s no way I can learn all these before I’m 18.\n\nThere are a bunch of studies that say that adults’ brains are less able to change opinions and learn new languages and stuff. How worried should I actually be?",

I can get a discount through my work, but if it isn't really any better than Duolingo, then I would probably just stick with the free option. I would be looking to study Italian if that makes any difference. Thanks in advance!",
