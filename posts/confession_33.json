Une de mes coll√®gues que j'ai aid√© n'a pas appr√©ci√© que je lui ai dit que mon nouveau chef qui √©tait en formation et qui lui a demand√© des comptes vis √† vis de son travail en retard l'ai fait (c'√©tait notre coll√®gue avant) et il l'a fait gentillement avec toute la bienveillance d'un nouveau chef qui ne sait pas encore elle lui a cri√© dessus et est donc venue s'en vanter chez moi et donc je lui ai dit que comme il √©tait en formation c'est la chef plus haut qui lui a dit donc de v√©rifier ou elle en √©tait. Elle n'a donc pas appr√©ci√© et est all√©e parler √† la harceleuse qui a commenc√© √† harceler plus fort  la fin de ma mission elle est all√©e trop loin j'ai donc demand√© √† ma chef de sortir elle m'a accompagn√©e et m'a demand√© ce qu'il se passait je lui ai expliqu√© et demand√© une confrontation qui n'est jamais arriv√©.

I just had to post what she said. \n\nSo my friend and I were talking, so she could show me her newly painted bathroom. ( its gray with black trim, super cool ) so when she turned to leave she saw a spider on her wall, now normally spiders dont phase her. This one however, surprised her. ( in her words ,and im paraphrasing) \"Oh God eww!!\" I said \"whats wrong ?\" She said \" there is this spider with long legs that looks like hair and its so gross\" I said \"I dont think those ones are poisonous.\" She said \" yeah but... ( she looks at the spider and says ) im sorry I dont mean to lower your self esteem but... (Looks at me ) its disgusting!\" \n\n I honestly had to stop myself from giggling while she got rid of it because I never heard of someone being worried about the feelings of a spider and now I cant help but hope her feeling reached it .",

        "text": "I have had certain levels of psychiatric intervention between the time we currently are in presently, and the time when I had made my last post discussing and searching for advice and clarity regarding my growing hatred and uncontrollable feelings of anger towards small children and the families of such. I have been in contact with my psychiatric care team and counsellor over the past week in an attempt to unmask the pathology of these intensive and continuously developing emotions and outlooks. I have found little to no advice in how to faithfully negate my behaviour in terms of the externalization aspect of the thinking. In other terms - it is a considerably more complicated and taxing task on both myself and professionals that are involved to change the thinking and the behaviour that stems from such, than it is to navigate, divulge, and even accept the reality of where these thoughts that I engage with and acts that I display come from. It feels as if am constantly balancing a thin tightrope between being comprehensively direct, vulnerable, and transparent in regards to the extent of my hatred towards children and families in society, specifically my homicidal ideations towards such, and reacting in the typical manipulative and purely dishonest fashion that is the per-usual for myself. I do have quite the covet to understand the root of these ways of thinking, however I am unable to change any of the behaviour. In actuality, the awareness of said pathology directly influences and promotes further deviancy and dark desire in terms of my hatred for children and family. I am formally informed on the craft and nature of human-psychology, meaning I had knowledge of nearly all, if not everything my counsellor had spoken to me regarding this matter, specifically the nature of the violent tendencies. Individuals such as myself typically do not seek treatment for these patterns of thinking and displays of behaviour until we are forcefully scheduled to do so by the legal system or our lives have crumbled to the point where are theoretically forced to do such, and even then we usually become darker and progressively more violent, just better at hiding such. I was patiently waiting in the walk-in-clinic in an attempt to \"work my magic\" yet another time in terms of my behaviours of manipulation and acts of munchausen when a clearly stressed and corpse-like mother sat down in the chair across from myself, waiving goodbye to her truth be told, cuckhold looking husband in what would be lengthy and patience-testing wait to be seen by a physician. However what waddled out from behind my chair, running towards her than pouncing into her arm was none other than what looked like to be a 6 or 7 year old female child, which I would later discover to be indeed her own. I could feel myself boiling inside, luckily there had been no other children presently inside the waiting room until this point, though I had to contain my seething rage as some had been in the parking lot outside the clinic with their disgusting families. I had been preoccupying myself with an anime on my phone while waiting for the curtains to open and my \\*scene\\* to begin. As soon as I was finished the episode I caught the child staring in my direction with those large, hope-filled eyes that hadn't been injected with any dosage of reality up until this point, that was soon to change. I brought down my mask covering my face as if I were to rub my nose - I \\*am\\* supposed to be incredibly ill after all, and gave this child the most murderous face I could possibly conjure - a pure display of the predator I keep shackled within the haunted vaults of my psyche, Pennywisesque to say so myself. She could sense it, she knew danger was near, and indeed it was, the danger being me. Bursting out in to tears she began screaming and pointing at me, attempting to gain her Mother's attention as they always do. Her Mother looked up as I pulled back down my mask and began a light bout of laughter with her. \"She always does this in public, I'm so sorry\" she said, as one of the nurses broke feeling of the tense situation and ushered me into the room I was to be seen in, my act had truly just began. I am becoming purely uncontrollable in behaviour such as this towards children, it feeds me, fills me. I have been engaging in acts similar in nature to the stare I had given the child quite a lot in the past week, more than the usual, though I have been further clued in to the causes of the thinking that I am enamoured with. Once again, does anyone have any advice at this point? Potential solutions to the issues that I don't necessarily even see as issues? Does anyone have any relatability to these behaviours? Thank you.",

I started crying the kid didn‚Äôt die yet but he died in the hospital. He never got a chance to say it was me, I lied and said he tripped, But as I was crying the voice told me ‚ÄúStop crying kid your not getting bullied anymore‚Äù my parents don‚Äôt know of this though.\n\nKid 2. This child was also a jerk me nor him could swim but he kind of could but not in the deep end. The kid kept shoving me under the water but luckily i could keep calm and float, and then the voice came back, ‚ÄúShove him in the deep end next time he tries to push you, get behind him and shove him in‚Äù I did, the kid drowned, because he couldn‚Äôt keep calm and float. Once again I started crying, Also mine and his parents where both doing something mine were getting dressed to go to the pool his were in the restroom, but my excuse was he tried to but bailed and panicked. I was 9.\n\nThats how i killed two children at 7 and 9, and yes the voices are still with me along with tons more, I just ignore them now because I‚Äôm not trying to become others with my name became.",

I didn't even do it in a pranking way. Just a menacing, inconveniencing way. \n\nDad was so pissed when he tried to open it and eventually ripped it open and asked us who the fuck did it I pretended I was asleep the whole time so he asked my brother if it was him and of course he denied it and dad thought someone might've just came in our property and glued it shut (fat chance there was like three phones and an iPad in the car they would've been GONE)\n\nNow that he lives 10 hours away I'm going to call him and tell him I'll let you know how that one goes pray for me",

I always had trust issues with new people, but I was really starting to like my new therapist. That was until this one day, where she had me sit in her office and asked my parents if they thought I was having any problem behaviors. My parents took that as a chance to kind of complain about me to my face, (about my lack of engagement, lack of eating, being moody, how easily upset I‚Äôd get, etc) and then my therapist made me respond about how I‚Äôd rectify those behaviors along with telling my parents some stuff I told her I was feeling lately in previous sessions. After the session my parents said they liked this one because she ‚Äúkept me in line‚Äù. And then yelled at me for the car ride home about being more honest with them and about how I made things sound worse to my therapist than they actually were. \n\nFrom that day on I was paranoid she‚Äôd use anything I‚Äôd said in session to force a confrontation with my parents, so I lied every session, said I was doing great, school was great, etc. At home id go to my room if I was upset, act happy when I wasn‚Äôt in my room, go to the bathroom and punch or burn myself when I was irritable, and eat all my food even when I wasn‚Äôt hungry, and then throw it up later. I was able to lie my way out of therapy. And since my parents didn‚Äôt see me getting upset anymore when I was with them, both them and my therapist agreed I didn‚Äôt need therapy anymore. Anyways thought I‚Äôd get that off my chest since I‚Äôm starting therapy again soon hopefully with more success.",

Well, I went over to my friend‚Äôs house for a birthday party, most of them being guys, and I wore my same converse there.. after the party was finished and I was getting ready to put on my shoes to leave, I noticed that my insoles were, well, missing. Someone had taken the insoles right out of my converse, and I know this because although they were just loosely laying in my converse, they wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúfall out‚Äù or anything! I didn‚Äôt make a big deal out of it though, and I just put on my shoes and pretended like everything was normal because otherwise it would‚Äôve been weird‚Ä¶ but what bothers me is who took out my insoles and why?? \n\nDoes anyone know what I should do now? These converse were pretty worn but they were my favorite despite being a bit tight and I really don‚Äôt want to spend money on a new pair! Should I confront whoever stole it by asking around or just leave it be?",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was 16-17M I had a drinking problem. I would drink whenever I could get my hands on alcohol because it was the only way I knew how to escape. I would do all kind of stupid shit when I was drunk, try to fight people, verbally abuse people for no reason, throw up in peoples houses etc. i would often get angry at my parents for no reason and once I even had a fight with my dad. \n\n2 yrs ago aged 17 I met up with 3 girls and a male friend. I had had a lot to drink at this rate. I was sitting in a bench with one of the girls and I put my arm around her. She did not object to this so I thought I was on the next stage of flirting. I asked ro kiss her, she said no to that. A minute later I asked again and a minute after that I asked once more. All 3 times were rejected. Eventually i came to my senses and realise my attention was unwanted. I feel as though if I was physically stepping the line someone would have intervened. I cant actually remember any of this happening, this is just what I got told. I never forced myself on this person and I didn‚Äôt get aggressive or violent when rejected. After this happened she and all her friends left the venue and texted my friend that I fucked up and that no means no. I probably freaked her out bad. I didn‚Äôt understand what I was doing and I thought I was flirting but I got it horribly wrong and upset someone \n\nEveryone alienated me after this, all 4 people involved stopped talking to me. My friend was extremely angry with me and started calling me a harasser. \nDue to the response provided I have false memories of what happened. I only asked for a kiss but my mind keeps telling me that I groped/raped her because of how angry everyone was after the situation. I live in constant mental imprisonment. \nI know for a fact I had no bad intentions but in my drunken state I got it horribly wrong. \n\n\n\n When I heard about my actions the next morning I felt disgusted with myself, I instantly apologised to the girl I did it to. \nLooking back it was quite s lame apology, I said some shit like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable last night I was really drunk‚Äù i didn‚Äôt know what to say\nShe told me she forgave me, my friend told me that she was initially upset after it had happened that I pushed her boundaries, but she accepted my apology. I don‚Äôt know if she just said this to make me feel better or what not but yeah. That was the last time i spoke to all the people involved. I feel disgusted within myself, I feel like a predator who kept pushing someone. I feel as though I might have traumatised her and ruined her life cos this was such a bad experience. It was after that I stopped drinking alcohol as a whole because I was now aware of its destructive nature. I haven‚Äôt done a thing of this nature since and realised that it was the alcohol dictating me. \n\nAfter I apologised I didn‚Äôt think too much of the incident, but 18 months later for some reason it‚Äôs come back into my mind and it‚Äôs all I think about 24/7. I really can‚Äôt understand why I did what I did. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt have done it sober, but I‚Äôve realised that it‚Äôs no excuse. Their friend said to my friend it wasn‚Äôt that much of a big deal but I still can‚Äôt forget about it. \nI feel like a piece of shit for trying to do something without the other person‚Äôs consent. I was verbally asking for consent but I was being pushy about it. \nSince this has been of my mind, I haven‚Äôt allowed myself to have anormal life, I‚Äôve since quit my job and I hardly leave my room. I feel as though this is who I‚Äôm gonna be forever. That drunk idiot that kept asking. I told one of my friends bout it and he said it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. I can‚Äôt even look my own mother in the eye knowing the way I treated a woman that night. No charges were ever pressed or anything, idk if I did something illegal or not but it was certainly immoral. \nI don‚Äôt know if asking for a kiss more than once is illegal (might fall under harassment) \nBut I feel I should‚Äôve received some punishment for my actions \nI hate myself for it every day and I‚Äôve been thinking about ending my life over this. Once u do something like this in todays society there is no going back. \n\n\nAlthough im 2 years sober and wont do something like this again I just cant let the past go. This haunts me 24/7 and honestly, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever forgive myself for it. \nI thought of myself as an ally of women but this situation says that I wasn‚Äôt. \n\nI‚Äôm a pig. A disgusting man who ignored boundaries. I‚Äôm sorry to all women that have to deal w shit like this. I‚Äôve heard some horror stories from some other girls and the stuff u have to put up with us disgusting. I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a part of that domain but this encounter proves otherwise. \n\nI physically cry my eyes out when I see my mother. I‚Äôve failed her, she told me to respect women growing up and I fucked it.",

Mostly places my parents/family/family friends have been. \n\nI met this fellow money collector guy who was a few years older than me. He shared he always wanted a kuwaiti dinar but could never get one. For context, my parents were living in Kuwait at the time and happened to be visiting. So, I took a dinar from my box and gave it to him. \n\nA few hours later, I told my mom what happened and she got annoyed that an older kid took money from me, and asked me to get it back from the kid. \n\nSo, I went looking for him. I knew where he lived. His dad told me he went to the bank. Turns out this guy took the money to exchange it at the bank. At the time this hapenned, Kuwaiti Dinar was the strongest currency in the world and was worth a lot. He had no intention of collecting or keeping it. I felt foolish and sad.",
