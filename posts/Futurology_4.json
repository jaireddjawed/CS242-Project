        "text": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/09/world/asteroid-collision-risk-2046-nasa-scn/index.html\n\n&gt;A newly discovered asteroid roughly the size of an Olympic swimming pool has a \"small chance\" of colliding with Earth in 23 years, with a potential impact on Valentine's Day in 2046, according to NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office.\n\nThe asteroid has a 1 in 625 chance of striking Earth, based on data projections from the European Space Agency, though NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Sentry system calculated the odds closer to 1 in 560. The latter tracks potential collisions with celestial objects.\n\nBut the space rock — named 2023 DW — is the only object on NASA's risk list that ranks 1 out of 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, a metric for categorizing the projected risk of an object colliding with Earth. All other objects rank at 0 on the Torino scale.\n\nThough the 2023 DW tops the list, its ranking of 1 means only that \"the chance of collision is extremely unlikely with no cause for public attention or public concern,\" according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, while a 0 ranking means the \"likelihood of a collision is zero, or is so low as to be effectively zero.\"\n\n\"This object is not particularly concerning,\" said Davide Farnocchia, a navigation engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n\nNASA officials have warned that the odds of impact could be dramatically altered as more observations of 2023 DW are collected and additional analysis is performed.\n\n\"Often when new objects are first discovered,\" NASA Asteroid Watch noted Tuesday on Twitter, \"it takes several weeks of data to reduce the uncertainties and adequately predict their orbits years into the future.\"\n\nThe asteroid measures about 160 feet (about 50 meters) in diameter, according to NASA data. As 2023 DW orbits the sun, it has 10 predicted close approaches to Earth, with the nearest landing on February 14, 2046, and nine others between 2047 and 2054. The closest the asteroid is expected to travel to Earth is about 1.1 million miles (1.8 million kilometers), NASA's Eyes on Asteroids website notes.\n\nThe space rock was first spotted in our skies on February 2.\n\nIt's traveling about 15.5 miles per second (25 kilometers per second) at a distance of more than 11 million miles (18 million kilometers) from Earth, completing one loop around the sun every 271 days.",

That is, instead of SkyNET or Star Trek's Data or Agent Smith, AI is a collection of amorphous, agency-free, problem-solving intellects that behaves more like a genie. Both the evil Jafar-genie and the benevolent Robin Williams-genie.\n\nFunnily enough, the structure of capitalism (which I blame for our ongoing dystopias) is actually encouraging the only positive way AI can turn out. It **has** to be democratized via consumerist channels thanks to the profit motive. Our wannabe totalitarian overlords might be drooling over the idea of infinitely loyal AI mind-slaves, but the way it's developing gives their future subjects (both humans and the AI) a LOT of ways to fight back.\n\nSo it won't be a battle of unaugmented humans versus their billionaire overlords / Gattaca babies / rebellious robots / hyperintelligent AI. Not when the way AI is being deployed such that ten unaugmented humans are the military superior of eight genetically engineered supermen -- especially when the unaugmented humans have access to the same AI tools as the supermen.\n\nYes, the way it's being deployed is nightmarish and catastrophic and could lead to accidental extinction, but let's be honest here: our current society is already nightmarish and catastrophic and would be so with or without AI. AI is just the pinprick of a syringe that may either contain penicillin or  Strychnine. But if you're in a muddy trench struggling to breathe after 2nd and 3rd-degree burns... well... why not take a risk?\n\n... thank God that robotics and automation are really starting to fall behind AI, eh?",

Ai will be the dark energy that inflate distance between people through pure information, or ddos of content. Fan communities getting smaller because there just so many games, movies, books that generated in a dime.  We no longer see the same things. Everyone play games tailored to them with bot that act like real people. if you go online every word you see, every picture, every video, every novels are made by few ai company or even government carefully curated to make sure you buy their stuff and don't seek out \"real people\".\n\nWhy chat with people online if your AI friends give you more immerse and better experience. Why work with people irl if you got UBI, why go to shopping when a drone send your stuff. If you are creative person, you don't need getting judged but those mean strangers. you can upload your text 2content to a site where a millions of ai fans give you the praise and validation of ticktock star. if you want to be educated there is a AI teacher, if you sad, you talk to a AI therapist. if you are still lonely, you can get AI soul mate with life like body and make AI kids to carry on your legacy..\n\nand then maybe nurolink or vr will be sophisticated to visit otherworldly place with your AI mates/family with all 5 sense.\n\nand when you go outside, real people are now scary, selfish and boring. They could hurt you, they never know your needs unlike your AI frends. they never have the patience to deal with your problems. all they do is getting in your way.\n\nIn the end of the day maybe for someone born 10 years from now, from life to death most of their interaction from intelligent beings are no longer the member of the same species.",

And that's not even discussing what could happen if it devolves into a dictatorship or civil war, both of which seem exponentially more likely now than 10 years ago.\n\nThe same goes for Russia and China where the demographics and economy are on track to catastrophically fail on a level where the state won't be able to suppress the chaos. For Russia moreso than China, but both nations have this looming over them.\n\nThe UK is seeing poverty rising at unprecedented rates while their economy is contracting almost as much as Russia, forecasted to be overtaken by Poland by 2030. Politicians openly discussing withdrawing from the European Convention on Human rights which, combined with growing poverty and dissatisfaction, opens all kinds of pandora's boxes.\n\nThe EU as a whole is also in serious trouble economically even if the impact won't be as rough as in the UK. Global warming will hit several central/western european countries \\*hard\\* if the past 5 years are anything to go by.\n\nPonder that you're an english speaking high skilled worker with liberal values and no family to worry about. Where do you go if you want to live in a place where you can be sure that your quality of life and political situation won't see a serious risk of rapid deterioration in the coming 10-20 years?",

        "text": "From years of my life, i have observed the rapid development of digital technology. From having to connect to the internet using telephone cables and using bulky computers to having it all in the palm of my hand. From having to send letters or pay expensive fees to call to people from out of town to chatting in rooms with them in a matter of seconds. Digital technology has become more and more accessible with more features being added to ease our lives even further. However, with great upsides comes downsides.\n\nright now, our personal information is able to be spread across the globe, sold by greedy companies who wants to earn a quick buck, or breached by interlopers who would do the same. In my country, our problem is so bad, you might just say that our people's data is open source. Drama makes buzz and it is exploited throughout social media to boost engagement. Even the news would make you question whats right and whats not. We've heard about these things day after day, perhaps even experienced it which makes it even worse.\n\nBecause of this, i want to ask, where are we heading in the future when it comes to technological advancements? From what i see, it's easy to say that we're heading towards a dystopian nightmare where the government or the corporation puppets everything. However some folks that i have discussed with about this told me that it won't be as bad as i might think it would be and all of this badness is just a cycle of life with ups and downs. We have good privacy practices that will mitigate some of our personal data problem and to combat internet drama exploitation we can just go outside and touch grass. However, these aren't really good proof that we're not heading towards a bad outcome. So, where are we heading according to global technological advancements and treatment towards it?",

Basically like a truly open world game within this world or any other, like the Oasis in Ready Player One or \"Roy: A Life Well Lived\" in Rick and Morty.",

Same thing with truck driving. \n\nSo many things will be taken over with automation. So, right now I'm only 24 years old. But what type of world will I be living in when I'm 45? 50? Obviously we can't predict the future perfectly. But are there any particular skills and things I should be taking seriously and learning now that will become extremely relevant in the future?\n\nI just applied for a part time job at a grocery store near by. But sooner or later. People won't be able to do that anymore. \n\nSo I guess my main question is, what should we all be learning to stay \"relevant\" in the work force 20-30 years from now?",
