        "text": "Hey guys,\nI know it has been awhile since this all happened but I just recently wrote a report on the area for one of my classes and thought I would share some of the most interesting things I learned here.\n\nThe region originally designated for protection was 1.3 million acres large and was the first national monument under joint management by the BLM and Native tribes but has since been reduced to 15% of the original size. The new boundaries have cut out dozens of amazing backpacking sites and thousands of ancient artifacts.\n\nAfter all of the research I have done it is very clear to me that the reduction of the area is almost entirely for the purpose of keeping Uranium deposits open for mining.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/uranium-firm-urged-trump-officials-to-shrink-bears-ears-national-monument/2017/12/08/2eea39b6-dc31-11e7-b1a8-62589434a581_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.bfdd8a3859b7\n\nand\n\nhttp://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=5121574&amp;itype=CMSID\n\nI was able to speak with Ken Krahulec, Utah's Senior Economic Geologist, and he made it clear to me that if mining were to reopen in the area, the price of uranium would first have to double or even triple before it would be economically viable. When I questioned him about the major damage done to the Navajo Nation in the 40s-80s by bad mining practices, He explained that those were different times and that we know much more about what dangers exist and on top of that we have much safer mining regulations now. However, I think better mining is beside the point. \nTruly the most impressive aspect to the land, other than its incredible beauty, is the connection the native tribes share with it. Over 100,000 archaeological artifacts can be found in the area, some dating as far back as 13,000 years old! I find that this history and connection to the land is far more valuable than the uranium deposits that are buried there. \n\nWhen I began writing this paper I found myself switching back and forth between Pro and Anti monument. But at the end of the day I would be happier knowing that the area is preserved and protected for future generations to explore and appreciate. If you have been to the area I'd love to hear some of your experiences there or if you have any questions feel free to ask! I've also included a link to the Bears Ears Coalition web page where you can donate to help protect the area!\n\nhttp://bearsearscoalition.org\n\nIf you disagree with my stance please leave a comment. I love to hear your opinion!\n\nThanks!\n",

        "text": "I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this topic but I guess I’ll see\n\nSo to preface I haven’t exactly thought extremely heavily on this idea and haven’t done much research on it, so please ignore my ignorance or feel free to correct any wildly idiotic portion of this lol.\n\nI was in my biology class half asleep when my professor started talking about some research he was doing in the marshes in our state of Louisiana. He talked about the nutria rat and how destructive they are to the wetlands and native species. We began to further discuss invasive species in general and how bad they are. \n\nI thought about how efficient hunters were at nearly wiping out alligators and bison throughout Americas history because of the monetary benefit associated with those animals way back in the day. \n\nSo I proposed the idea of a government or private sanctioned organization that would pay hunters for every animal or # of invasive animals they killed. $50 for 10 nutria rats or just 10 invasive animals for example or something along those lines, with particularly devastating animals having higher rewards. \n\nPerhaps the local government makes a budget plan to accommodate the cost, or this theoretical private organization has a second hand deal with leather or fur enterprises that could use the materials from these animals,but certainly the benefit of wiping them out would net an overall positive effect for the local areas and ecosystem.\n\nAfter I blurted out  my idea, my professor said, “man, If someone did that, I would donate $1000 to the cause immediately and join in on the hunting.” \n\nAfter he said that I can’t get the idea out my head as to if it would be effective in the sense of wiping these animals out. I honestly don’t know how the economics of that would work out and honestly is probably the main drawback of my idea.\n\nI want to get the more scientifically or conservationist inclined as to whether you would support something like this for the sake of the native ecosystems and animals that are being destroyed by these invaders. Obviously this is supposing that it was economically viable. \n\n",

        "text": "I'm creating a platform, called WONDR, to help like-minded people discover and share useful resources around topics they care about. We're focused on supporting interests related to the environment, such as conservationism and climate change.\n\nThere's currently a few hundred people on the BETA platform but we're opening up applications for 30 more people, and I wanted to see if you'd like to be involved?  \n\n**What to expect**\n\nThe features will help you \n\n* Match with other like-minded people to connect around the topics you care about \n* Share useful resources, collaborate and collect knowledge (from the web and WONDR), including the ability to add notes (so you don't have to rely on memory). These collections can be made private or public.\n* Build networks of people around specific interests to create conversation and discussions\n* As you, and others, build knowledge in your public spaces, you'll discover other relevant insights that people have already found, to save you time and energy looking for yourself.\n\nWe currently have a range of environmentally minded people such as, marine biologists, environmental researchers, zero waste aficionados and beekeepers on the platform, with whom you can connect with for meaningful discussions.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nWe're very passionate about supporting the topics you care most about and I'd love to hear your thoughts on how we can improve your experience.\n\nIt's free to join and you can delete your account afterwards, if you don't like what you see. We take your privacy &amp; security very seriously.\n\nPlease PM me or get in touch at [WONDR](https://mywondr.co) if you'd like to learn more or to hear how you can trial the platform.\n\nThank you",
