        "text": "Hello,  \nI started learning Japanese recently using textbooks from LEDA.cz, starting with scripts since I figured learning to write/read will be the best start, and beginning with Hiragana.  \nToday I was going over vowel lengthening rule and it was easy to understand until I got to the last cases which were exceptions.  \nFirst one was that, when verbs end with ou or uu these are not pronounced as long vowels but a diphthong.  \nExamples: think →   おも*う*  → Omou, is pronounced Omo-u not Omoo/Omō  \neat →   くう → Kuu, is pronounced Ku-u not Kuu/Kū  \nThis I get.  \nThe problem comes with the next exception. Here I will give my best translation form Czech of their explanation:  \n*\"If in a word consisting of two or more symbols there are two vowels after each other, of which the second is an initial sound of symbol's reading, it is not a long vowel or a diphthong,\"*  \nExamples: case, situation →  ばあい → Ba'ai, pronounced as Ba-ai not Bāi  \nraspberry →  きいちご → Ki'ichigo, pronounced as Ki-ichigo not Kīchigo  \nfoal →   こうま → Ko'uma, pronounced as Ko-uma not Kōma  \nThey don't state this as and exception but as a rule of pronunciation but I don't get it because I'd say in words such as okaasan (おかあさん) or chiisai (ちいさい) etc. also fall under the definition of words *\"consisting of two or more symbols there are two vowels after each other, of which the second is an initial sound of symbol's reading,\"* but we pronounce them as with long vowels okāsan and Chīsai.  \n\n\nWhat is the difference I'm not getting here?   \nDo people learning Japanese in other language happen upon something similar or is this something they are trying to explain from Czech-speaker point of view?  \nHow did you learn to pronounce the words Ba'ai, Ki'ichigo, Kouma?  \nAre there maybe just words that are exception to the long vowel rule that I need to memorise by heart?  \n\n\nPlease help.",

I have taken a very basic level of Japanese a few years ago and have knowledge of Chinese language. \n\nThe main criteria for what I'm looking for is a reputable Japanese program that has qualified teachers with experience teaching foreign students. Preferably one that is aimed more at academically or professionally minded students rather than a more undergrad study abroad experience. \n\nSome non-crucial criteria would be accommodations arranged by the program and options for one-on-one or choose-your-own content-style classes.\n\nI understand that I'm a bit late in the year to be applying to language programs as many deadlines have passed but would appreciate any help with finding the right one. \n\nTLDR: I am a graduate student looking to learn Japanese this summer in Japan. I'm looking for a reputable program with a more academic or professional feel to it. One-on-one classes would be great but not required.",

I’ve started on the core DJT order 6k deck, which was definitely the best out of all the decks I looked at. What I like about the deck is that often words are grouped by the kanji used in them, which has been really useful in attaching a sense of sound to different Kanji. \n\nI still feel it’s not optimal for this though. Often times kanji will but put next to each other just because they look similar, and it’s not very strict in how it groups kanji etc. \n\nI was wondering if anyone had ever made a core deck specifically with the intention of going from RTK a to a large vocabulary, grouping the Kanji phonetically. \n\nMy ideal order would group not only words containing a particular kanji, but also followed by words that share a phonetic component with that kanji.\n\nObviously as words contain multiple kanji exactly how you group them would be a lot of personal choice and prioritisation, but I was wondering if anyone had made something like this before.\n\nAlso, I’m not trying to start an RTK, or core deck vs immersion mining etc debate, my plans been working for me and if you really want to have that debate I’ll probably do a write up/ review in a couple months",

        "text": "So this is what I'm doing. I already knew hiragana and some basic kanji already, but I've decided to take up Japanese and learn it seriously. Started 1 month ago. I'm going through Genki student's book and workbook and going out of my way to learn the vocabulary in its kanji form, I'm also practicing Kanji on Kanji Study app (almost finishing with the first 100 kanji from Elementary 1). On the side I l'm playing a visual novel/dating sim/tactical JRPG game (サクラ大戦3 ~巴里は燃えているか~) [Sakura Wars 3: Is Paris burning?] and I look up all words and kanji, I write them on a notebook and add them to Anki (In a sitting I end up stopping writing the words because it's a slog and I begin to get burned out). I'm doing the same with ドラえもん 第一巻 (Doraemon volume 1) manga. And from time to time, I watch some anime (this is what I do the least) with no subs and I try to pay attention to the Japanese pharses and pronunciation (I'm basically watching the Sakura Wars anime and Doraemon anime, since I'm working through the videogame and manga respectably). \n\nI'm learning a lot of vocabulary and getting used to the flow and grammar of Japanese sentences. I obviously forget words, but little by little through Anki and the words getting repeated on Sakura Wars videogame and Doraemon manga. Surprisingly, I'm having more difficulty with Doraemon than with Sakura Wars. In SW I got all the kanji to look up and thus easier to look up words, as well as the language being more proper and the kind of language you would get on a text book (or military school or battle tactics manuals, SW has a lot of army words). Doraemon is harder because the language is more colloquial, therefore more idioms and words getting \"chopped\" (like だろう turning to just ろ) and these things are not featured in any dictionary, and what also contributes to the difficulty is the lack of kanji (Surprisingly). Most words are written in kana and because Japanese have a vast list of homophones, it's harder to look up words without kanji. Because of this Kanji is necessary for Japanese written language, and I dare say, that kanji is somewhat useful to remember words. I find myself remembering better the kanji words than the kana words. They're just more visual.\n\nAll in all, I'm enjoying the ride. I'm having fun learning Japanese, although there are times that I get a little overwhelmed when I'm going through the Sakura Wars videogame and the Doraemon manga for too long and I get thoughts like \"Japanese is too difficult, I'm never going to learn it\" but I tell myself that the learning process is little by little and that if I keep doing this for years , somewhere along the line, I'll become fluent. \n\n僕の長い記事を読んでくれてありがとう。",

I use italki every now and then but I need someone where I can just message someone and have a chat in Japanese, and meet up and practice speaking it. I use hellotalk but people only tend to speak for a little while and then stop responding so that’s not really much use either.\n\nAny help is really appreciated!",

        "text": "Hi! This will be the second time I'm posting about these classes. As full disclosure, I am involved in teaching one of the classes.\n\nThe University of Hawaiʻi Outreach College offers non-credit low-cost Conversational Japanese Classes via Zoom. The best part about the classes is that it has one hour of conversation practice time with Japanese speakers during the last hour of the class. When the classes were in person, Japanese people in Hawaii were volunteering, but with the move to Zoom we now have mostly volunteers from Japan.\n\nEach term is 10-weeks with three terms a year (fall, spring, summer) and classes are on Saturdays from 9am-11:45am HST. Early bird registration is $25 off the regular tuition price, and even at the regular price tuition comes out to around $8\\~$9 an hour.\n\nThere are 7 classes/levels to choose from and students can change levels if the one they chose was too easy or advanced for them up until the 3rd week of class. The instructor for the advanced class also does informal oral interviews for students who don’t know what level they should go into. The Elementary classes focus more on speaking instead of reading hiragana/katakana/kanji, but they are introduced. Hiragana/katakana knowledge is highly recommended for the Intermediate levels since the textbook does not have romaji at that level. There is no textbook for the Advanced level, and it’s mostly focused on topics and grammar that comes up in JLPT N1/N2.\n\nLink to the classes are [here](https://www.outreach.hawaii.edu/areas-of-study/language-arts-humanities/)",

And my progress so far has been...slow. I have thus far been focusing on learning the kana. As of now, I have memorized all hiragana and know all the \"extras\" as I call them (like dakuten, blended letters, long consonants and vowels, etc). I can write them comfortably as well. My main resource is Busuu (not perfect, but I am quite enjoying it!) so I've learned some very basic vocab as well.\n\nHowever, I have seen many people say that learning hiragana and katakana can be done in a few hours' time, which is amazing to me and makes me feel like my progress is incredibly slow. \n\nI anticipate that katakana will take the same amount of time, if not longer, to learn than hiragana - so I'm looking at about a month total to learn both of them.\n\nI'm sure I'm not alone in wanting to just dive right in to learning kanji, reading, and vocabulary. But I really wanted to do this right and master the basics first. I guess I'm just feeling a bit discouraged because, with my memory issues, it feels like it will take me a long time to see any meaningful progress.\n\nHow long did it take you guys to learn hiragana and katakana? Anyone else out there dealing with learning Japanese while having memory issues and/or being neurodivergent? \n\nHow do you maintain motivation when it feels like your progress speed is not where you would like it to be?",

I am currently a little over halfway through Tango N5 and about halfway through JLab, and I finally understand the convenience of kanji/words constructed from kanji. I started reading simple children’s stories, and reading is so much faster when you instantly recognize the word when it is comprised of kanji. Again, all of this is obvious for people who have been learning for quite some time, but, if you are a beginner like me and are getting frustrated with memorizing so many words, it is absolutely worth it as reading purely in kana honestly sucks and it’s much harder to pick out words from kana alone. Just thought I would share some thoughts on this as I have realized the convenience of the daily anki reviews.",

There are around 180 episodes of the podcast, as well as other videos with more advanced content. \nI only listened to a couple episodes for now but it was pretty exciting to find myself able to understand almost all of the dialogue at the first attempt! \n\nI hope someone else will find this as useful as I did!",

        "text": "Hey! I love Japanese and have been learning it for around twoish years now. I noticed there is no lack of content on YouTube when it comes to Japanese learning so finding a good YouTuber when you need help with grammar points is fairly easy(unless you start getting into more advanced stuff). However, there is a lack of Japanese learners on Youtube who have content that interest me. I think having a reference Youtuber who is also learning the language along with you and struggles, all the same, is valuable because it helps increase my motivation and helps me feel not so alone in this uphill battle of being self-taught :)\n\nMost YouTubers who are learning Japanese seem to already be at a very advanced level and though I enjoy watching the occasional Dogen video, this isn't his fault, but they make me rather depressed too. Outside of that, many learners of Japanese have content that is clickbait things like \"WHITE GUY IMPRESSES JAPANESE LADY WITH-\" and well...this content is far from appealing to me. Korean learners have Natalia Garza who is very fun and realistic, straight-up making videos about what she HATES about Korean learning because language always has its things that make us want to rip our hair out. She does this while still fully delving into learning the language and still having fun. I find that while I'm rolling around in the intermediate plateau, I've been desperately craving for someone to be REAL.",

        "text": "Well, looks like I wasn't quite finished....I am currently playing Persona 5 Strikers and upon reaching the conclusion of the first part, lo and behold what appeared on screen.... I have reason to believe there may be more, so why not take the opportunity for some more textual analysis courtesy of the Phantom Thieves.  \n\n\n*Calling card -* *予告状 - (Yokokujou)*: For those wondering what it is, In the game, Persona 5, these cards were sent by the Phantom Thieves to the persons they target, indicating an imminent attack on their psyche to \"change their heart\", i.e. to make them confess what they have done and change their ways. Basically the card outlines their particular crime, why they're being targeted, and informs them that the attack is coming the following day.\n\n(The Japanese word for \"calling card\" which is 予告状 (Yokokujou). Oddly enough, in the soundtrack, the lyrics of the battle song \"Take Over\" make reference to a \"prior notice card\" which is a direct translation of the word.)\n\nIn the original Japanese version, the calling card is read out in the cutscene of the broadcast. In the English version, this dialogue differs slightly from what it says in the calling card but the gist is the same. The calling card is in game as it appears on screen during the cutscene, but the bottom is missing and has been completed thanks to the spoken lines in the Japanese version.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n*Original text:*  \n\n\n人の心を弄ぶ女  \n柊アリス殿。  \n偽りの光で人を貶め、  \n愉悦の為に傷つける。  \nそんなヤツを、私達は許さない。  \nアンタが奪った人々のネガイ…  \n今宵、我々が頂戴する。  \n**心の怪盗団より**  \n\n\n   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*English (my translation, not necessarily the English translation of the game):*  \n\n\nTo the woman who toys with people's hearts  \nMiss Alice Hiiragi.  \nBehind a fake image, you degrade   \nand hurt people for the sake of your own personal enjoyment.  \nSuch an individual, we cannot allow to continue unhindered.  \nTonight, we will take (back) all of the desires you have stolen from people.  \n**From the Phantom Thieves of Hearts**  \n\n\n  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n*Romaji:*  \n\n\nhito no kokoro wo moteasobu onna  \nHiiragi Arisu-dono.  \nitsuwari no hikari de, hito wo otoshime,  \nyuetsu no tame ni, kizu-tsukeru.  \nsonna yatsu wo, watashitachi ha yurusanai.  \nanta ga ubatta hitobito no negai   \nkoyoi, wareware ga wo choudai suru  \n**kokoro no kaitoudan yori**  \n\n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Notes:***\n\n柊アリス殿:  Hiiragi Arisu-dono. Welcome back to the wonderful rabbit hole of Japanese names. She's a showbiz person and therefore her name, Alice, is written in Katakana. Last name is Hiiragi, using the equivalent Jinmei character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nネガイ (negai) 願い   wishes, requests, more so than \"desires\". The English version of the game translates it as desires, however the word in Japanese is different from Yokubou that as in desires from the original Persona 5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n貶め (otoshime); from 貶める  (otoshimeru), to look down upon, be contemptuous of. This is yet another Hyougai kanji that is not taught in schools.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nアンタ: (anta) is a very rude form of you. It is a contracted form of あなた (anata) which is a standard polite form of you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n頂戴する: a nice formal way of saying to take, to gladly accept taking something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n許さない: (yurusanai): The negative form of 許す (yurusu( meaning to forgive, allow, overlook\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nヤツ (yatsu): rude form of \"hito\" (person). Can be translated as guy, bloke or worse, asshole depending on the context. (Trying adding the rude plural form \"ra\" to it and you basically have, \"those bastards\")\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n怪盗団 (kaitoudan): The Phantom Thieves, or literally, \"ghostly thief band\". all 1 word with 3 characters.  \n\n\nより (yori): It's a special \"yori\" here, not the comparative one, used to say less than/more than. Rather here it is similar to \"kara\" meaning from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n \n\n*Previous posts (Persona 5):*\n\n[First Calling Card (Kamoshida)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10usyu7/persona_5_first_calling_card_kamoshida/)\n\n[Second Calling Card (Madarame)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/114xbyo/persona_5_second_calling_card_madarame/)\n\n[Third Calling Card (Kaneshiro)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1197pw4/persona_5_third_calling_card_kaneshiro/)\n\n[Fourth Calling Card](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/11avlbd/persona_5_fourth_calling_card_japaneseenglish/)\n\n[Fifth Calling Card](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/11cffo0/persona_5_fifth_calling_card_japaneseenglish/)\n\n[Sixth Calling Card](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/11efwr3/persona_5_sixth_calling_card_japaneseenglish/)\n\n[Final Calling Card](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/11hb0ht/persona_5_final_calling_card_japaneseenglish/)",

        "text": "おはようございます！\n\nI have a question about the differences between the grammar in the title of this post.  I'm trying to find the difference between the three grammar usages.  I've tried rephrasing a sentence in different ways, and I want to make sure I'm understanding the connotation of each one based on the usages.  If any of these are grammatically incorrect or I'm misunderstanding the meaning, please let me know!  I want to master the difference between the three.\n\nMy understanding goes as follows for the following examples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;その女の子は泣く**だけ**でした。  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That girl could only cry.  (It's all she could do in the given situation).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;その女の子は**ただ**泣きました。  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That girl merely cried.  (It's nothing special, she often does/it's to be expected).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;その女の子は**ただ**泣く**だけ**でした。  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That girl just cried. (It's all she could do, but it's nothing special because she often does/it's to be expected).\n\nBasically what I'm understanding is that using ただ〜だけ merges the initial two meanings together, though I'm not sure if my interpretations are accurate.  But this is just one set of examples, so I'm trying to figure out the difference of the connotations in different contexts as well.  If there are any other examples anyone provide of the difference between between the three, I'd really appreciate it!\n\nどうもありがとうございます！",

        "text": "Hello, I'm here just to ask about somethings but before that, I want to mention some stuff...\n\n(I already speak 2 more languages that have similar grammatical structure to Japanese. I'm a Pakistani and I speak Pashto because I come from a rural village and Urdu/Hindi well...just because, and well...obviously English because I loved cartoons and watched them like 8 hours a day continuously for more than 14 years and just learned it somehow?)\n\n I started learning Japanese for the sole purpose of playing a not-well-known RPG because I had played other games from the same author previously... Luckily, they were translated so I didn't have to go through the trouble of learning a language Just for playing a game. However, when I found out that there is a game that hadn't been translated yet, I felt restless and could not help but wanting to play it. This was very much likely because of my love for the type of games he made.\n\n But, I was very well aware that I would need to learn Japanese for this one. I did some research on Japanese and found out many more reasons for me to learn Japanese. Moreover, there were a lot of resources available to learn it and so I began learning it.\n\nAt first, I tried Genki but I dropped it half way as I didn't think it was improving my Japanese at all. I learned the both the kana in just under 2 days. Furthermore, I started researching about Kanji and started using Anki for my vocabulary (Tango N5 Deck Cards as I found it comfortable. I used 5 wpd but later when I felt comfortable I changed it to 10 then 20 and then currently 30.). I feel as Anki helps me lay the foundation for my vocab that I further strengthen with immersion (listening and writing for 1 hour each.) and so, 1 month goes by...\n\nI feel as due to my knowledge of 2 languages that have similar structure to Japanese, I was able to get more comfortable more easily than others... I still occasionally lose my way here and there on things that are completely new to me (grammar and vocab) that comes naturally when learning a language. I just wanted to know how much of Japanese do I need to know to please Visual Novels, RPG games, and much much more. I want to know what are the requirements (Vocab amount, N-Level, Grammar level etc.).\n\nThere are a lot of things that I decided to skip over so if you have questions, then I answer your questions and you answer mine! thanks in advance to everyone!",
