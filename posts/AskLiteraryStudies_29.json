        "text": "Hello r/AskLiteraryStudies. I'm sorry for the rather simple topic, but I was hoping someone could help me recall the title of a play I remember reading a few years back.\n\nIt is Renaissance era, British, about a woman who dresses as a man and acts quite masculine. However, it is NOT a Shakespeare work. \nThe handling of the subject matter is a bit more serious in nature, by the standards of the era at least, than works such as The Twelfth Night or As You Like It.\nI actually thought Christopher Marlowe was the author, but I cannot find it through a google search to that effect. Does this sound familiar to anyone?",

In 19th Century literature there was a debate as to what the role of the novel is and thus we had romanticism, then realism, then naturalism and symbolism, then the Russian novelists came at a critical time with a new insight into what the novel can bring... And then cinema was born and assumed many of these roles, delivering a narrative more accessible for the average person and i feel like the novel itself lost its identity. I haven't done any research on this topic, but what do you all think?\n",

Can you help us?\nChapter 21, Eddie Mars to Marlowe: \"“You talk a good game,” he said. “But I dare say you can break a hundred and ten.\"\nMy guess is that Eddie is saying that he'd compare Marlowe's penchant for violence to a shabby but not terrible golf game. Another thought was perhaps a similar reference to bowling (this might be anachronistic, no?). One pal, thinks it somehow references football....he's not much of a sports guy.\n\nThanks in advance for your help all!! Feel free to slip in a recco for the next book.

At any rate, I'd love to hear from those of you who are familiar with his work and have an idea of who may have influenced him, whether that is from things Houellebecq has communicated himself or your own educated guesses.",

        "text": "While reading an article ([\"Can Analytic Philosophy and Literary Criticism be Friends?\"](http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/spenseronline/review/item/45.3.1/) by Andrew Escobedo) over at *The Spenser Review*, I was struck by a particular passage:\n\n&gt;One winces, for example, at the subtitle to Colin McGinn’s 2006 philosophical study of Shakespeare: *Discovering the Meaning Behind the Plays*. This will not do, of course. If the meaning is \"behind\" the play, then one presumably can peel away the latter to reveal the former, an assumption that appears to govern a number of McGinn’s interpretations, alas. Yet literary texts perform their meaning as much as they communicate it, and so this meaning often cannot be captured in strict logical formulations or extracted as propositions. If analytic precision must not divorce meaning from its form, however, it can nonetheless help provide more lucid and accurate descriptions of the interplay between the two.\n\nSure, I wince at that subtitle too. With most literature, and certainly with anything Shakespeare wrote, to claim there is a static \"meaning\" awaiting discovery is hilariously reductive. Assuming the existence of a well-defined \"meaning\" seems to me like a recipe for criticism that is naïve, and pretty dull to read. I support what Escobedo is saying in this passage.\n\nWith that said, I'm interested in knowing more about his remark that \"literary texts perform their meaning as much as they communicate it.\" The article quickly moves on, but I wanted a little more explication of this comment. What exactly is he saying, here? I have a few fuzzy guesses as to what it might mean for a literary text to \"perform its meaning,\" but I'd like to hear how others understand this phrase.\n\nPS: What little background I have in literary theory and philosophy is the product entirely of my own reading. I'm not a literary scholar, so for my sake, please don't assume too much of me in your answers.",

        "text": "Was prose style really important in the novel?\n\nI hear a view that suggests that style in the novel didn't receive that much attention until William Faulkner, James Joyce, and the modernists gave us their novels of luxurious and fantastic language. \n\nHowever, when we look at some of the writers of the 19th century and earlier, such as *Moby-Dick* by Herman Melville, the tales and sketches of Nathaniel Hawthorne (or even his major romances, *The Scarlet Letter* in particular), and the novels of Charles Dickens, we see excellent language at play. Not only that, but Gustave Flaubert was meticulously concerned with style in his novels, and there were many other novelists who wrote wonderfully even before.\n\nSo, was style as big a concern for novelists before the 20th century, as in consciously trying to write beautiful language?\n\nI have also heard that [the style of the 19th century novelists was more concerned with rhetoric.](https://johnpistelli.wordpress.com/2013/09/14/modernist-fiction-as-romantic-poetry/)\n\n&gt;Earlier fictional prose was not so concerned with beauty; if language-conscious, I would suspect it tends toward the gestures of rhetoric (i.e., concerned with persuasion) rather than any sort of lyricism, as when Dickens mounts his soap-box or George Eliot starts philosophizing.  The major exceptions that leap to mind–Melville with his Shakespearean and Miltonic thunder that would make way for Faulkner and his successors; Flaubert with his precise visuals and flowing sentences that inspired writers as varied as Joyce and Cather, Hemingway and Nabokov–were more valued in the twentieth century than in their own time. \n\nWhile this does sound true, I think it is fair to say that there were those concerned about making their language beautiful, like Melville or Wilde. Plus, Shakespeare seemed to be concerned about his style as much as he was about his storytelling. So there's that.\n\nI would also like to know if there are any good books or studies that I could be directed to that cover the issue of style in the novel, or English prose style in general. I'm really enjoying Robert Alter's *Pen of Iron*, which covers the impact the KJV had on American prose fiction, and I enjoy his focus on style. I'm interested if there are any good resources that focus on style like Alter does in some of his works.",

I'd like something that goes beyond simply listing conventions, to find out if there's anything like a structure that underlies most epics and if there is, the inner logic or analytic significance behind this structure, what makes an epic succeed (or not), why the continued use of poetry in epic in literate cultures, analysis of epic poetic meters, and so on.

I really want to do my research paper on a sci fi novel. \n\nHere is a description of the course from the course syllabus\n\n&gt;The unconscious was first conceptualized in Romantic intellectual contexts, but it was Sigmund Freud’s theorization that established its prominence for literature and psychoanalysis. The unconscious was associated in his thought from its inception with literature, dream work, and the operations of metaphor. These ideas were radically extended by the theoretical writings of Jacques Lacan and Jean Laplanche, whose recognition of the linguistic aspects of the unconscious shaped literary theory in lasting ways. Implicating memory, imagination, creativity, affect, and experiences outside of conscious control (hypnosis, trance, dreams, hypnogogic states), the unconscious presupposes a rich theory of mind that challenges the Cartesian inheritance. This course will explore psychoanalytic writings on the unconscious, its intersections with literature, and the intertwining of Freudian dream analysis with such rhetorical figures as metaphor and metonymy. We will investigate trauma, melancholia, sexuality and desire, memory, and dementia in a variety of texts, exploring the psychological aspects of literary analysis and considering intertexuality as an effect of a literary and historical unconscious.\n\nWhat are some good cyberpunk novels with themes relating to Lacan and Freud? I am thinking about doing it on \"A Scanner Darkly\"; would you guys recommend doing that? What are some other Cyberpunk novels that could work? ",

I just finished a MA course on the Grotesque and its realisation in German literature, so seeing that term on Reddit made me feel a little warm inside. But, as one can imagine, 80% of the comments were about vomiting, pooping and other encounters with the bodily fluids and growths; others were about [animal miscarriages and putrid stench](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3yx5wi/whats_the_most_grotesque_thing_youve_ever_done/cyhn5gs) (which is the most grotesque thing I read in that thread) and so on. Things the commenters had encountered IRL. But isn't the grotesque more than that..?\n\nNone of the comments, obviously, mentioned encounters with *grottescas* (such as in Nero's [*Domus Aurea*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Domus_fresco.jpg)), Jacques Callot's [etchings](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/The_Hanging_by_Jacques_Callot.jpg) or tried to tackle the concept of the grotesque as such, as some literary theorists like Wolfgang Kayser, Mikhail Bakhtin and Peter Fuß have done in the 20th century. You know, the Grotesque isn't just the typically comical/horror stuff that the term has degraded into, but it is the uncanny that intrudes into our world, it's the abbyss that stares back into you as you stare into it, it's our way as humans to cope with and aestheticize absolute unexplainable otherness. Or, according to Bakthin, the Grotesque is the expression of a long lost *laughing culture*, the original medieval Carnival, in which social order is momentarily suspended and renews itself through a collective grotesque body. And aren't literature and art the best vessels to contain this grotesque experience (even better than having your hands covered in the decay of your SO's previous meals)?\n\nThat said, I'm very interested in what you people would pick as the most grotesque thing (book, poem, passage, tragedy, song, whatever) you've ever read/heard. Be it Kafka's *Odradek* or the killing machine in *the Penal Colony*; Jonathan Swift's *Modest Proposal* to end all Irish famines; or that black metal [track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pp44rWLgqA) that seemed to foreshadow the events in Cologne. \n\nIt should be self-evident why I don't ask this on /r/AskReddit.",

        "text": "[I asked this in /AskHistorians and was kindly redirectly to this sub]\n\nIn Western literature and fairy tales there is a frequent trope of the \"faithful servant.\"\nIn many cases, there is little reason for the servant to be so faithful-- at least from a modern perspective, the hero does little to EARN the loyalty of his servant.\n\nThe Miller's Son in *Puss in Boots* is just an everyman, Phileus Fogg in *Around The World in 80 Days* is a self-aggrandizing jerk, and perhaps most puzzling is when the hero saves the life of a bandit or thief and earns his undying devotion (*The Count of Monte Cristo,* various stories in *Arabian Nights*). \n\nIn *The Lord of the Rings*, Samwise is not even paid to accompany Frodo; he was his gardener, not his valet, and they are not exactly friends because of the weird class divide.\n\nThis is leaving aside any racial/colonialist dynamics as in *Robinson Crusoe* (Man Friday), but just with people of the same country/culture.\n\nWhere does this pedestalization of the servant come from? Is it a Christian thing?\n\nIn many cases, the servant is a perfect, virtuous and exceedingly capable Mary Sue, and while it's quite useful to have an Everyman around when you're constructing a story, the trope of the Faithful Servant seems to have a moralistic tone.\n\nI think there must be some dynamic that doesn't translate to the modern era. If you save someone's life, they don't move in with you and devote themselves to your needs in order to repay you. Moreover, the attitude of the master towards the faithful retainer seems to be one of ... entitlement? In *20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,* the narrator speaks in fond, but condescending tones about the brilliance, bravery, and devotion of his faithful manservant Conseil, kind of like you'd talk about your very well-trained and obedient dog. \n\nI could go through my library of fairy tales and old novels and find dozens of examples of this dynamic, and even modern send-ups like Jeeves and Wooster and Bunter and Lord Peter Wimsey, which takes the trope and exaggerates it for comedic effect. But I've never really seen an explanation for why this is such an unquestioned dynamic of so many stories, especially when there is absolutely no modern equivalent for such a devotion to an employer. \n\n",

But I feel like there's more to it, for example how they're both suffering from their inexperience of life, which leads to somewhat poor decision making.\n\nAnother example of interesting things to compare would be how the cruel reality affects the naive newborns. The monster is driven towards morally questionable deeds, which takes him further away from the love of his creator, who is already neglecting him.\n\n The puppet, on the other hand, is the one who neglects his creator, and basically doing bad stuff because he won't listen. The lessons he learns leads him back to Geppetto, who was of course right all the time.\n\nAnyway, what I'm asking is in the title.

I think I even spotted a French uni in our podcast stats. We're tossing around the idea of creating a set of fun PDF's that help take a reader from \"I like that but I don't know why\" to a deeper analysis and understanding. Honestly, I'm not even sure if this is a good idea. Thoughts? Also, if there are any professors who'd love to audit this thing for technical errors, I could really use help.

        "text": "Hi all, this is my first post here. I'm hoping some of you might have insights that can help me out. I'm currently working on an undergraduate thesis that is a sort of comparative analysis of Anglophone and Japanese dystopian literature. One element that I'm really missing out on right now is information about the Japanese reception of Orwell, in particular the novel 1984. I can read Japanese pretty well, but it is slow-going, such that with a more obscure topic like this, it's extremely time-consuming just trying to find proper sources, much less mine them for relevant information. This is especially true since the term \"1984,\" when entered into a database search engine, often doesn't deliver relevant results. In other words, I wouldn't have trouble READING the sources, but FINDING them has been much more of a pain than I anticipated. \n\nSo, basically, I was wondering if anyone knew about anything like notable reviews of 1984 by Japanese critics, Japanese Orwell scholarship, or even just sources for general information. Anything -- titles of articles, books, links to websites, names of databases or magazines -- would be helpful. In short, I need to discover how Orwell's novel was received by Japanese critics and readers. \n\nIf anyone has any information, no matter how tangential, I would very much appreciate your assistance. Thanks for taking the time to read this!",

I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”\n\nI read this when I was a teenager and I've yet to come across another writer who conveys this feeling quite as profoundly as Plath does here. I don't even know how to explain it - that feeling of the options being narrowed, doors being closed, knowing that some paths are mutually exclusive and being led towards a future that you don't want.\n\nIt's a feeling that I'm dealing with at the moment and while Plath hits the nail on the head, but I would like to find some other writers who discuss it. \n\nAny suggestions?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the suggestions. I'll definitely check some of them out. Woolf was mentioned a few times so I'll try some of her suggested novels first. ",
