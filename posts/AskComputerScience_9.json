        "text": "As someone who has been programming for a while (almost 7 years now) and is a current CS student, I have asked myself this question often. I  have seen ads from companies like IBM bragging about such things and even heard people talk about it as a good thing when bringing up projects.\n\nWhile I realize that naturally more lines of code should indicate more work and possibly a more intricate program, there still seem to be so many things wrong with such a claim to me.\n\nIf person A can write a program in 200 lines but person b can write it in 100, shouldn't we use the program written by person b?\n\nIf I were to guess, I would say the 100 liner is probably more concise, lighter in terms of size, and maybe even more understable. \n\nAs well as that, saying your company has written x lines of code just means absolutely nothing to me as a programmer. That could be millions of lines of overcomplicated garbage, it could be written in a verbose language, or it could just indicate a failure to use existing tools and libraries.\n\nSo why is it that companies and people brag about this? Am I missing something or can someone shine more light on the situation?",

So if some news article says that if 'Trump has passed away' then I need to tell it's fake. I don't want to go towards classification algorithms. Rather than using classification algorithms I would like to use analytical approach to detect the fake news. This is what I have come up with so far -\n\n&gt;So I will create a list of trusted websites, let's say BBC is in that list. Once user inputs the headline and the content of the article, I will scrap all the related articles to given headline from trusted websites and then compare those articles with current article. Now the first problem I am facing is that is there any way to compare two articles. I mean both articles might say same thing but in different way. How do you do that? Is there any NLP based algorithm which can tell if two articles are same.\n\nApart from that do you have any other ideas of detecting the fake news? Any approach is appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

(as in 000-FFF or 0000-FFFF etc.)\n\nI have the answers to the questions, I just don't understand why. Here they are if it helps\n\nNumber of different OPCodes: 16  \nMem size in bits: 28 positions * 12 bits / positions  \nMem range: 00-FF  \nData range: 000-FFF  \n\nThanks.",

        "text": " \n\nI hope you are all well. My question is about a certain lab assignment I have been working on. Here is the prompt:\n\nAn Int is a signed 32-bit type that has a range from =&gt; 2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. A long is a signed 64-bit type and is useful for those occasions where an int type is not large enough to hold the desired value. It has a minimum value of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and a maximum value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive).\n\n1. Create a class myLong that is capable of manipulating integers up to size 100 digits! As a guideline, you can get help from arrays to store your values and implement this idea. Or in any other ways that you nd it more convenient to work with. For example: the number 3,125,311,345,678,998 should get store in array a = \\[312531; 1345678998\\]\n2. Create method setLong to get a long integer from key board.\n3. Create a method getLong that displays your long values on monitor.\n4. Create methods add, substract and multiply to add, subtract and multiply longs and return the value as an array.\n\nKeep in mind that you are not allowed to use any build In methods that convert integer into longs or vice versa.\n\nSo, basically here is where I have started:\n\n    public class myLong { public void setLong() { } public void getLong() { } } \n\nAlso, this is supposed to be written in java... So I completely understand what I have to do, but as far as getting started, I am very confused. How do you think I should start with the first method? Any help would be fantastic!\n\nThank you",

But to make sure I want to ask professionals on reddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou see an Internet based on Ethernet and IP. The round icons are  switches. The square symbols are computers with one or more network  interfaces. How many networks does this internet consist of? The computer n1 sends a SYN packet to the computer n8. Computer n1 knows  the IP address of n8. Describe in detail at the Ethernet level and at  the IP level how this SYN packet will be sent through this Internet.  Choose suitable MAC addresses and IP addresses wherever you need them  for your description. Which computers are involved in this action?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/w154tafzrmm11.png\n\nSince n1 knows the IP Address of n8 it puts the syn paket into  an  ethernet frame with the mac address of n4 in the header(n4 is the local  gateway). The switch checks the ethernet Frames header and sees the mac  address. If the switch knows the mac address it will forward the  ethernet frame to n4 otherwise the Switch will need to do an ARP  Request. The computer n4 which is also a router will open the ethernet  frame and will see the ip of n8 is from another subnet. so it will pack  the syn packet in a new ethernet frame and send it to it's local gateway  which is n6. The frame header now has the mac address of n6. Again it  will go through the switch and now n6 received the ethernet frame. n6  will open it and it will see the ip of n8 and it will check it's routing  table if it has the mac address of n8. If it does it will go through  the switch again and computer n8 will receive the syn packet. This internet consists of 4 networks and 4 switches. \n\nIs my approach correct? Thank you in advance.",

Computer A sends to computer H a UDP packet with the payload \"ABCD\". Show the essential parts of the Ethernet package leaving Computer A. Explain on all subordinate network levels how the payload of the UDP packet is routed in detail to computer H. Explain which network component makes which changes to the package. How many local Networks are there? How many switches are there?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/7ac6p2f1rkm11.png\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI came up with an answer but I have a feeling I am missing something crucial.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my answer:\n\nComputer A knows the IP Address of computer H. So it creates an IP-Packet wrapped in an Ethernet Frame with the Payload string \"ABCD\" and the header of the frame has the mac address of the local gateway (the router). So computer A sends it and it reaches the switch. The switch looks at the header and sends it to the router because it knows the port and the mac address of the router. Computer F is the Router because it has two IP addresses (and also two mac adresses for each local host.) Router F opens the IP-Paket and Ethernet Frame and sees that Computer H is not in it's local network. So it creates an new ethernetframe and puts the IP\\_Paket and the payload inside. The destination mac address of the frame is now changed. We repeat the process and this time it reaches Computer G. Computer G (the router ) looks at the header and sees that computer h is in it's local network. If Computer G knows the Mac Address of Computer H it will send it to Computer H otherwise the Router will send an Arp Request. If it sends and Arp Request all the other Computers will get the message and H will send an arp response and G will send the Paket. Computer H will open the ethernet Frame and the Paket with the payload ABCD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThats my answer.\n\nI think there are 3 local networks and three switches.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

To be clear, I'm not trying to make a playable game, just a program that will give me logical outcomes of a single night's worth of Mafia. This is just for fun, not for school; I'm really into the game in my personal life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSay I have four players, assigned to numbers 1-4.\n\nI can assign Mafia and Doctor their roles like this:  \nMafia=random.randint(1,4)\n\nDoctor=random.randint(1,4)\n\nBut I don't know how to assure that the same player will not receive both roles. I've been using an if statement to avoid it, but it's annoying to have to run the program several times to get a single result. It looks like this:\n\nif Mafia==Doctor:\n\nreturn\n\nIdeally I'd like to be able to assure that they're different roles every time.\n\nI also want to somehow exclude the Mafia from being able to kill themselves. So, if I have a variable MafKill that says who the Mafia is going to kill that night, I would want to make it so that MafKill cannot be equal to Mafia. I can again do that with the same if statement as before but ideally I'd want to be able to exclude a number from the range. I feel like I could do this with slicing or something but I'm not sure how. Mathematically, it would look like a combination of these two conditions:\n\nMafKill = random.randint(1,4), MafKill != Mafia\n\nThis is important to be able to do for the game in general too. I'd also like to be able to assign percentage chances for a certain number to be chosen, but I'm fairly sure I could do that easily on a small scale with the probability function.\n\nThanks for reading, and if there's a better place I could be asking this question please let me know!",

When I got out of high school I sincerely thought I was going to do something in the computer science field. But then I took 2 years off to travel and recently got into a serious relationship and I don't feel as interested in it as I once was. Now I feel split we are planning on moving to North Carolina near the Asheville area. Im down too two choices between a Finance degree and one in computer science both of them scaring me and attracting me in different ways. \n\nFor Computer science my pros are that I've always loved being on computers messing with them and just working with them in general and am very interested in how they work, where as my cons are I feel like all the jobs in that field are on the west coast and I won't make a decent salary in North Carolina.\n\nFor Finance my pros are that I've always loved math and very recently have been curious about the stock market, budgeting money, and trying to build wealth. Plus finance jobs I feel like are everywhere. My cons are mainly that I don't think I can make any money with that degree or I have to be a all star in order to make good money or that I might find it soul crushing and hate it.\nPlease help me if you can the more I think about this decision the more split and frustrated I become sorry for the long and probably terribly written message and I hope I posted this in the right place thank you for your time.",

I delete these entries from original list.\n\nFrom here I have both matrices of constants I need and can perform row operations on the numbers.\n\nWhere should I go from here?\n\nI know I need to keep track of row operations so that when I'm reducing a column to have only one non zero entry (a 1), I can quickly do the mathematics on the rest of the rows.\n\nI ended with defining three functions, one for adding and subtracting rows (by multiples or not) . One for scaling rows. And one for switching. I don't really know how to have a list (multi dimensional at tyat) as a parameter though and what I've read hasnt helped.\n\nThank you for the long read, have a cookie! ",
