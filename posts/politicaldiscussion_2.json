        "text": "Joe Manchin is generally disliked by liberals due to his more conservative views however they must consider he represents a deeply Republican state. West Virginia is a state which voted for Trump by 39 points and Moore Capito by 43 points. Therefore, he is the only Democrat that can get elected in WV. To ensure that he can continue to get re-elected he must adopt positions which align with his home state, this may not align with his fellow Democrats.\n\nHis voting record on some issues can be considered pragmatic which sometimes is against his party’s position. A main example is when he voted in favour of Gorsuch and Kavanaugh as his constituents likely supported those nominees. Furthermore, he wasn’t the swing vote hence they would have been confirmed anyway therefore it would be pointless to waste political capital. \n\nHe has adopted positions on issues such as abortion, energy policy, gun laws and immigration which are supported in West Virginia but are opposed by more liberal Democrats.\n\nHowever, it must be considered that he has a sided with the Democrats on some crucial issues. He voted against repealing Obamacare, the vote was very close. He voted against Trump’s tax cuts. He voted to convict Trump twice in the impeachment trials. He supported legislation as part of Biden’s agenda such as the rescue plan act, infrastructure act, chips act, IRA. He has supported most of Biden’s judicial nominees include Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nSome liberals may consider Manchin a Republican but he is still part of the Democratic Party despite pressure by Republicans to defect. \n\nKyrsten Sinema takes similar positions to Manchin despite representing a purple state. She has officially left the Democratic Party.\n\nIn conclusion, whilst Manchin sometimes votes against the Democrats, a Republican replacement is more likely to vote against the Democrats all of the time.",

        "text": "Unilateral secession is illegal, as ruled in Texas v. White; therefore, a constitutional amendment would be required. This means that congress and state legislatures will have to consent. Also, there would probably be a requirement that for a state to announce its intention to leave, 2/3 of voters must agree in a referendum. This makes secession unlikely. However, if a supermajority were to leave the US, the process would be harder than Brexit. The UK was still a sovereign nation when they were in the EU.\n\nOne issue is financial obligations. States most likely to leave will typically pay more to the federal government than it receives back. Therefore, there would be a shortfall in the federal budget. Similar to Brexit, the state would have to pay a divorce bill before they could leave the union. The cost of the divorce bill would probably have to be negotiated, but the federal government would likely have the upper hand. State taxation would probably have to increase.\n\nAnother issue is that federal agencies would leave, meaning hundreds of thousands could lose their jobs and leave the state. This would increase unemployment and would severely damage the economy. Furthermore, new agencies would have to be created, costing money and resources.\n\nAs the state becomes a new country, it must establish its citizenship, currency, banking system, external borders, military, and governance structure. They would need to source their own energy, resources and telecommunication systems. They would be required to form diplomatic with countries worldwide and join organisations such as the UN and WTO. They would have to seek new trade deals with countries they previously had when they were part of the US. The new country would have a weak hand in any diplomatic negotiations.\n\nThe new country would likely have strong trading and cooperation with the USA; however, anything they sell must comply with US standards. This would mean they would have even less say than when they were part of the US, as they have no federal representation. Also, cooperation on national security issues would be on the USA's terms. It would likely mean the new country would be a vassal state to the US. This would entirely defeat the purpose of secession, which is to gain sovereignty.\n\nThe potential problems with state secession are not exhaustive and are similar to Brexit. Whilst secession would be bad for the USA and the seceding country, it would likely be worse for the latter.\n\nThose advocating for secession rarely discuss the practical implications.",
