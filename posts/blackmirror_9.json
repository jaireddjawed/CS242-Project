It doesn't seem to be the case, but the thought crossed my mind: Humans need to be primed to use the memory recaller with scent and sound triggers, and seemingly have to cooperate and consciously attempt to look back for it to work. \n\nSo that guinea pig thing? Maybe it was just a desperate effort that the police didn't believe would work but had to go through with anyway because of procedural rules. \n\nOr, maybe the entire last scene at the crime scene was Mia's own paranoid fantasy. The irony of the kid being blind was Mia's mind questioning if her actions were really necessary. The guinea pig wasn't even there but Mia imagined it as a loose end. The police were there for some other reason or maybe were hallucinations. \n\n\"It was all a dream\" is rightfully seen as a lazy and disappointing plot device, but in this context, I would like it. She gets away with the murders but pays the price of her sanity.",

        "text": "I think the best word I can think to sum up my feelings after watching this episode is ???\n\nPerhaps it's just mangled expectations, but when the guy started going into the different narratives and such, along with the fact that it was a museum showing hints of things from past episodes, I got the impression that they were going to explain where certain Black Mirror tech came from (or at least, the internal logic evolution of it). Not necessarily 100%, but to some reasonable degree that would help shape the structure of the Black Mirror universe.\n\nBut ultimately, I left feeling more confused about the Black Mirror universe than before. It ended up feeling like the nuggets in the museum referencing other episodes were just fan service, not something with any actual internal logic in the story.\n\nFor example, the lolipop on the dish that was presumably referencing USS Callister. This raises so many impossible to answer questions if it's supposed to follow internal Black Mirror universe logic.\n\nIs this supposed to imply that Daly was using a variation on tech developed by the people who Rolo Haynes was working with? Or was Daly one of the people developing the tech in the first place? How could Haynes have possibly gotten ahold of it at all? Are we to presume that the story of what happened with Daly somehow got out and Haynes somehow got access to the dish, despite having no apparent connection to the incident?\n\nI don't want to dwell too much on that one point though. \n\nOther things that left me feeling more confused: I believe it's imply or stated that cookies came about as a result of the \"can experience thing that other person is feeling\" tech, but it's still not explained why we should give a shit about what happens to cookies other than the fact that they are copies of a human consciousness and therefore could have self-awareness, even though they probably don't since they can be deleted, paused, etc., so easily. I don't know if this is left ambiguous on purpose, or if we are just supposed to go along with the weak sci-fi (stuff like references to how much of our brain we use and another consciousness taking up space.. what?? I expected better from a show like Black Mirror).\n\nSome other references made... St. Juniper (presumably related to San Junipero - a cool connection, but not explored at all).\n\nA world where torturing someone or something is considered entertaining and sporty, considering the crowd Haynes had at one point (fits with the people going along with White Bear), but yet, no explanation as to where this cultural evolution comes from. Is it just presumed that this is how people in RL are? How does this exist in the same universe where cookies have rights? The juxtaposition makes very little sense to me.\n\nAnd then it's stopped because of some protests? \n\nThis just felt sort of like White Christmas, but with more questions than answers at the end and no clear connection between them. Multiple narratives, not necessarily related, just an apparent halfway explanation of how certain tech came to be. Spends way too much time on each story and barely explains anything about the tech. And at the end, Nish is only connected to one of the stories and none of the others have any meaningful relevancy, other than being filler for showing the evolution of tech, but not in a way that really explains anything conclusively.\n\nIs this just me having mangled expectations? Why does this episode feel like such a mess?\n\nI feel like it had some really solid moments and build-up, but it doesn't get tied together well at all. I also didn't really feel much sympathy for Nish. The reveal was too abrupt and the fact that she was so vindictive about it didn't help. I'm not sure if she was supposed to be a sympathetic character or not. Maybe the point was that she was as twisted as Haynes was.\n\nI dunno. Like I said, confused.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/99n42n/a_comprehensive_timeline_and_analysis_of_the/",
        "text": "I have seen a few timelines proposed on this sub for the sequential order of episodes of Black Mirror. This is difficult to do as the technology featured does not seem to have an obvious continuity, and the Black Mirror universe uses subtle Easter eggs rather than overarching plots to tie in episodes with one another. \n\nWith that said, here is my timeline, along with some analyses on what is going on in the world at the time. Rather than attempt to number every episode, I have decided to group episodes into eras. The order of episodes which share an era will not always be definitive. This timeline also relies on some non-canon extrapolation, but to the best of my knowledge, my timeline does not contradict any established canon. \n\n\n**The Modern Era**\n\nThis era is characterized by present day tech.\n\n1) *The National Anthem*,\n    *Shut up and Dance*\n\n2) *The Waldo Moment*\n\nThese three episodes do not rely on hypothetical future technology. The only problem Waldo presents for the timeline is the ending, that Jaime wakes up in a seemingly dystopian future. Jaime does not appear to have aged much, so we can assume it is only a few years later. \n\nI theorize that Waldo was a passing fad. While many powerful people did exploit it, I think that they were not successful in the long term using Waldo as a means of population control. The city in the ending scene certainly looks futuristic, but ultimately we don't see anything more than armored police and a lot of screens. Perhaps this time was a brief period of unrest, but society resumed looking relatively normal shortly after. \n\n\n**The Postmodern Era**\n\nThis era is characterized by near future tech.\n\n3) *Playtest*,\n    *White Bear*\n\nThese two episodes show near future tech. White Bear is nearly possible in the real world now, assuming we could perfect a technique for inducing the desired amount of retrograde amnesia required to continually make Victoria accept the fiction. \n\nIn Playtest, Cooper dies in the moment he tests the gopher game, so the tech did not necessarily have to be advance enough for the horror game Cooper played, which was a time dilated experience Cooper had in his own head as all his \"synapses lit up all at once.\" \nTech required for a virtual reality uploaded to someone's brain may be far off in the real world, but it seems closer than the tech featured in all other episodes. \n\n4) *Hated in the Nation*\n\nIt is interesting to note that in this episode, the UK has a Chancellor rather than a Prime Minister. This could be indicative of a political shift that started in the Waldo era, or it might be what came after the Waldo era once the UK became stable again after whatever unrest in Waldo caused armored police to prowl the street. However, the UK may still be a relatively normal democracy at this point: Chancellor and Prime Minister are comparable positions with different names.\n\n\n**The Augmentation Era**\n\nThis era is characterized by early transhumanism and a comprehensive understanding of the human brain which allows for the tech featured.\n\n5) *Crocodile*\n\nThis episodes features the most primitive tech of the era.\n\n6) *Arkangel* \n\nThis is a precursor to the more advanced grain tech in The Entire History of You.\n\n7) *Be Right Back*\n\nBe Right Back is one of the most difficult episodes to place, as it requires very advanced robotics technology, but it certainly predates sentient cookies and simulation tech. I believe this episode fits within the Augmentation Era, but I'm not sure where. But because of how realistic and dynamic Ash is, I have decided this happens right before the UK embraces grains.\n\n8) *The Entire History of You*\n\nThis is the peak of the augmentation era. This happens at least several decades after Krokodil and Arkangel, as there are children who have had grains long enough that they are using them to sue their parents for insufficient attention. I also am going to make two guesses: One, that many people do not have grains (they are not mandatory and all the people featured in The Entire History of You are upper-middle class, they might not be available to poorer people.) Two, grains were eventually done away with. And from here we enter: \n\n\n**The Simulation Era**\n\nI have chosen to place this era here and use it to categorize two episodes which are very difficult to place on the timeline.\n\n9)  *Hang the DJ*,\n    *15 Million Merits*\n\nThe placement of 15 Million Merits here is probably going to be the most controversial thing on this timeline, because I am contending that 15 Million Merits was a simulation. Two reasons for this: One, in Black Museum, 15 million merits is a story that is read in a graphic novel which shows Bing with the shard of glass at his throat. Two, it‚Äôs just an absurd world, and in my opinion, too absurd to be real. The use of the bicycles implies not only an energy crisis but that humans despite advancement have not only run out of fossil fuels but are no longer able to exploit solar, wind, nuclear or any other kind of power. And yet for the primitive technique of creating energy by pedaling, screens are everywhere, sucking up a lot of this supposedly vital energy that everyone pedals so hard for. What the purpose of this stimulation was is unknown. If you disagree with the simulation theory and think 15 Million Merits is real, then it‚Äôs the furthest into the future.\n\nI am placing Hang the DJ before all cookie featuring episodes, and the reason for this is the assumption  that the sims are not actually sentient. As they lose time and can‚Äôt remember where they were before, I think that the length of the episode, around 50 minutes, is actually the length of a ‚Äúlifetime‚Äù in the sim and that nothing we didn‚Äôt see happened to the sims. These two episodes are by far the most difficult to place, since placing them relies on several assumptions. \n\n\n**The Cookie Era**\n\nThis era is characterized by the creation of sentient cookies.\n\n10) *White Christmas*,\n      *San Junipero*,\n      *USS Callister*,\n      *Black Museum*,\n\nPlacing these episodes in any kind of sequence is difficult, but I think they all happen within a short time of one another ‚Äì the time frame between Rolo Haynes‚Äô transition from his neuroscience job to his death in the Black Museum. \n\n\n**The Era of the Beautiful People**\n\nThis ironically named era is the furthest into the future. \n\n11) *Nosedive*,\n      *Metalhead*,\n      *Men Against Fire*,\n\nI theorize that the events of these episodes happen at about the same time. The world of Nosedive is the world of the beautiful people, those who are left in proper society after all the roaches were thrown out or killed. Civilians are augmented with the rating system while soldiers are augmented with Mass. At this point, we have entered a totalitarian and brutal world. While an international military hunts roaches, civilians do not have to be overtly controlled by the government because they control each other via ratings instead, as they live in a world where one‚Äôs rating affects every aspect of their life. \n\nWhat about Metalhead? I propose it is not an apocalypse, but rather that all the humans seen in Metalhead are roaches and the dogs are military equipment designed to hunt them down and kill them. Perhaps the place in Metalhead is an area in which roaches were successful in waging a prolonged guerilla war. The military found it too costly to outright conquer this area, so they instead sent dogs to kill everyone.\n\n\n\nAnd that‚Äôs the timeline. I want to emphasize again that the placing of Hang the DJ and 15 Million Merits are debatable, as is the question of whether 15 Million Merits takes place in the physical world and whether the sims in Hang the DJ are sentient. I hope you enjoyed reading. Feel free to offer your take and where each episode should be in the timeline.",

I was thrilled to find out that he is going to play a part in one of the new Episodes in season/series 5 of Black Mirror (I have been watching this show since its first seasons were released on Netflix in Germany).\nI searched for an article where that is mentioned but I realised that nobody seems to know that. This is why I wanted to post this and maybe even to start speculating together on what this episode is going to be about and who else is in the cast/crew of this episode or the rest of the new season/series.",

        "text": "\"Warning about future technologies and their effect on our society\"; That was the gist of what I got as an answer when I asked around about this show. But I think the way more important thing this series does is how it brings up the darker side of the society and human nature. Many (but maybe not all) of the themes which are brought up in the show are actually timeless; The futuristic (and sometimes current) technology is more of a \"catalyst\" which is used to shed light on these psychological and societal factors so to speak.\n\nLet me give two examples:\n\nThe episode \" Crocodile\" points out the fact that how fear and desperation can make the most descent people (at least according to their own self-image) to do things which were unthinkable to them before. Mia wasn't a psychopath. Although I still have a hard time believing that most people would go along the path she took, but I strongly believe this was the idea this episode tried to convey. Maybe this episode was exaggerated, but the core idea holds nonetheless. Now, here is the main point: The mind-reading technology in this episode was peripheral and unnecessary, but a very good tool to strengthen the plot.\n\nAnother example is \" Nosdive\". The main theme is obvious: people addiction to social approval and the possible destructive effect this addiction has. This is again a timeless theme in my opinion. The episode tried to push this to the extreme to show us its danger. I think the way Lacie and others in that episode tried to gain approval can be called quite rational in that world, but apart from that it was successful in showing the hazardous nature of social approval addiction.\n\nI appreciate if you can provide your viewpoint on my evaluation. Also, I like to hear your interpretations of the timeless ideas which occur in different episodes of the show.",

Like the guy that got off on pain the Black Museum was in a comma and we didn‚Äôt hear any more punishment from him after he killed the homeless man and probably broke several laws by delaying the treatment of patience just for his own sensations but Joe from ‚Äòwhite christmas‚Äô was locked in a cookie for the entirety of Christmas when each minutes = 1000 years of cookie time, with a constant blast of Christmas songs for what? He accidentally killed a man who was threatening him with a knife. Yes technically he killed the little girl but not intentionally and all of that was caused by him not being able to see ‚Äòhis‚Äô daughter for (as far as he was concerned) no reason. \n\nThe guy at the end of Black Museum is Permanently getting executed by electrocution for the murder of 1 woman (which he didn‚Äôt actually do) and the guy in white Christmas is banished from society because he helped some lonely guys get laid? \n\nI get how black mirror is supposed to be dark and depressing but things like that seem a little over the top for the society they‚Äôre in don‚Äôt you think? üòÇ\n\n(Lastly sorry for the crappy grammar and other stuff I‚Äôm currently very tired) ",

        "text": "I remember before Season 4 I once voiced an opinion that I couldn't be sure the 'clones' in White Christmas were sentient beings that could feel pain (physical or emotional), rather than just complex computer programs with pre-programmed reactions.  Therefore I didn't fully buy into the shock value of the episode derived from the torture inflicted upon them.  A few people agreed with me but most didn't.\n\nIn season 4 we have similar situations with the digital consciousnesses involved in USS Callister and Black Museum with people showing revulsion to the torture inflicted on them and much of the power of the episode deriving from that.\n\nSo this makes me curious - why does nobody see any ethical dilemma in Hang the DJ?  While the digital versions in this episode are not 'tortured' as such, they are created, put through a series of forced relationships (not all pleasant) and then destroyed a couple of years later.  If these consciousnesses are indeed sentient then this forced servitude and then murder just for the sake of finding out how compatible two 'real people' are is also highly morally questionable at least.  Yet this episode is considered uplifting and happy and I have never seen this seriously questioned.\n\nAs someone who never fully bought into the concept, I am not really best placed to answer this, but for those who did, what is your opinion?",
