Not sure if the series  ever got finished but I seem to recall that one of the successors’ names sounded Asian and he was eventually killed. \n\nThanks for any leads!",

        "text": "Sure, it's an old tradition for science fiction authors to promote their political views in their works (even H. G. Wells did this).\n\nBut with a few exceptions, politics has always been a small part of a book / movie, if present at all. Science fiction authors understood that their readers want an adventure and the sense of wonder, not a long political rant about economic systems and whatnot.  \n\nThe recent trend is to add horrendous amounts of politics and societal commentary, to the point where a science fiction book becomes a novelization of the worst parts of Reddit. \n\nThe disease is so widespread, in the past few years I have to drop 2 of my favorite authors. \n\nFor movies / series, I've found an easy solution: simply don't watch any Hollywood science fiction. With a very few exceptions, the story quality is too low, and the vast majority of their screenwriters seem to be infected with the political disease. And it's easy to find excellent movies / series elsewhere, with much less politics (e.g. Japan).  \n\nUnfortunately, there is no easy solution for books. \n\nHave you also noticed the annoying politicization of all things science fiction? How do you handle it?",

It was not easy for us because it is difficult to raise money.\n\nWe do not stand out with marketing knowledge. We try our best, I am active in social networks, but still only a few of our acquaintances bought the first chapter, which was not a profit, but a loss in terms of money.\n\nPersonally, I have high hopes for this comic. I draw completely, which also requires a lot of work, and it is very difficult to draw a comic in parallel with various life activities.\n\nI finally finished drawing the second chapter and we put it on the Indiegogo website, but it's been a few days and we only got $15 in funding, and we need at least $600 to print at least a few copies of the comic. More money = more comics.\n\nThe comic is about the zodiac kingdoms. Little by little, everything becomes more mystical. The first two chapters may leave you with a few questions, but after about 5-10 chapters, I believe this comic should be a huge success. That's why we ask you to support us and be one of our first audience until we introduce ourselves to a large audience.\n\n**You Can Fund Us Here:**\n\n[**https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/zodiality-chapter-2/x/23496935#/**](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/zodiality-chapter-2/x/23496935#/)\n\nHere Are Some Pages from the Comics:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/thtggbx7imga1.jpg?width=2391&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9666329ebe6941d32188053d61596015419c8851\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/emy75dx7imga1.jpg?width=2391&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8ad846c46c322e4750d4143eda4e1fc33f194f04\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bai8dcx7imga1.jpg?width=2391&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=54bf06a6a6b3681976ca58ef04e969f33708dd6f",

On the other hand, this would also make it easier to wage war as the moral dilema of forcing people to fight and take lives won't be as much of a deterrent.\n\nI'd like to read a book that explores this concept, that people no longer wage war with soldiers but just with machines.

        "text": "So, I have always wondered this- instead of like wearing power suits or creating literal terminators that eventually hunt humanity, why not create robots that you could control with your mind? This way, you're out of harm's way and can effectively defeat any obstacle.\n\nThe only logical roadblock to it is lag. It will take some time for information to travel from your brain to the robot and back again. If there's a delay of more than 0.5 seconds (read a research paper on this), you can't effectively control the robot. What this means in layman's terms is that there's a certain range beyond which your mind won't be able to control the robot.\n\nHowever, this isn't that big of a problem because the range in question is very big. With proper systems in place, information can travel at light speeds. However, assuming the speed of transmission is 100 times slower than light speed (which is the speed of internet in most places), it still gives us a whopping 3 million meters per second speed. In with that speed, information can travel 120km from the brain to the robot and back again in 0.08 seconds. In other words, you can efficiently control a robot at 120 kms, at least.\n\nSo, Tony stark can sit a city away from a battle in a bunker and control his suit efficiently without risking his life. I think this should be used more often in fiction.",

        "text": "SPOILERS!\n\nEver since episode 3 came out, I’ve seen discourse online about it. People complaining about the seemingly unnecessary episode and others saying it was a beautiful, heartwarming story. These two camps seem split because of the subject matter, namely a gay relationship. People who liked the episode think anyone who didn’t is homophobic and those who didn’t like it think people who did only liked it because of its subject matter.\n\nIn my opinion, the real issue has nothing to do with the subject matter but rather the execution. It could have been a straight relationship and had just as much of a problem. The series up until that point (granted it’s only 3 episodes in) has been very focused and had a consistent theme and “feel”; grim, gritty, dark, etc. It’s post-apocalyptic with strong themes of despair, hopelessness and it’s highly critical of humanity and our failings as a society. \n\nEpisode 3 totally breaks away from that to tell a mostly self-contained love story, which it does beautifully. Unfortunately, that’s just not the story most viewers believe they signed up for. Most people I’ve talked to freely admit the episode is very well done, but they wished it wasn’t such a disconnected experience. It would be just as jarring if I was watching a romantic comedy series and they took a whole episode to tell the story of a serial killer who’s tangentially connected to the main plot. The creators stated in the after show they felt they had an opportunity to explore expand on a side character from the games, giving more depth to the overall world.\n\nThis is all well and good, but if you wanted to do that, tie it in to the main storyline instead of dedicating 99% of the episode to it. Have Bill be alive when they get there and have Ellie slowly learn about his backstory and life with Frank over the course of the episode. Have Bill and Joel talk about losing their significant others and show how each of them deals with it. End with Bill taking his own life after passing on his story and maintain that same theme of despair and bleakness you’ve spent the previous episodes building up. Just a rant I’ve wanted to get off my chest as I’ve been frustrated with the discourse seemingly missing the point (as I see it).\n\nDisclaimers: I didn’t play the games and don’t care how they did the story in them. This is an adaptation and changes are part of it. My issue is with the overall tone and jarring nature of the episode. Also, obviously SOME people are just homophobic and would be mad about the episode regardless of changes. F those people.",

        "text": "Hello! I was considering trying to write a Sci-Fi novel, and I needed some feedback. It kinda sucks, I’m not really cut out to be a writer. I have a basic idea for the story, but I’m not sure if it’s been done before. If anyone would like to read it and research to figure out if it’s original or not, that would be great. I also need help with the “science” aspect because I don’t want it to be complete bullcrap. Here it is:\n\n10 years ago, the outer solar system was destroyed.  A bright gamma ray ruptured our sun’s magnetosphere, and destroyed Pluto, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and Earth. Over 95% of the world’s population (about 12 billion) was wiped out. 600 million people were evacuated to Venus and 400 million died of radiation poisoning. We had to stay in our evacuation ships, except for the workers. The workers were people who voluntarily put on one of the 200 Enviro-Suits NASA developed for terraforming other planets the year prior, to celebrate year 2100 coming. They left them on the evacuation ships, which were originally going to be used for exploration before the ray hit. The workers dug tunnels underground with the suits’ digging mechanics, and soon we had the colony of Braean. Humanity moved beneath the ground and used our ships as homes to protect from the intense heat. In the past years, Venus had cooled and lowered the surface temperatures to 91 degrees Celsius, and the underground temperatures to 21 degrees Celsius. Recently, we began expanding our colony downwards towards the core. Until one worker discovered the Caverns. The Caverns were a series of lava tubes inhabited by dinosaur-resembling creatures called Krael. These creatures have thick, armored skin and a carnivorous appetite. We had just set loose man eating monsters. However, we have one thing to protect from them. Core energy. Surviving NASA scientists had been working on a project called EnMagno-Fields. They were giant force fields using the power of Venus’ core to create a magnetosphere, protecting us. We left Braean and built 5 new colonies; Senten, Aemim, Meren, Toral, and the largest of all, Corus. Over the years, we’ve developed them and turned them into greater spaces. My name is Malum. And my mission is to bring down the walls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat’s the first chapter, it’s basically a story about this 15 year old who was evacuated to Venus, he thinks humanity is evil so he wants to bring down the EnMagno-Spheres and let humanity burn and be eaten by the Krael. Pretty dark, but whatever. I’m not a good writer, so I doubt I’ll do anything with it but I might if people want to see it. Main character is a hacker and wants to hack the Spheres to make them go wild. Corus is a full on cyberpunk city, while the other colonies are smaller but still cyberpunky.",

        "text": "I finished reading the book the other day and my overwhelming response to it is disappointment. The whole final section/chapter, i kept waiting for Holsten to figure things out, and make contact. I kind of assumed that was the whole point of the book. Holsten spends so much time thinking about how the empire went wrong, and how they just blindly followed in its footsteps, and wonders what they might have achieved with a fresh start. And then he see's a civilisation that did just that. His whole arc felt like it was leading up to this meeting, and i was eagerly awaiting the moment when he would somehow manage to communicate with them... and then it just never happens. And what happens instead feels like such a deus ex machina. The spiders planning to  capture/rescue rather than kill i can understand, but the virus just instantly making everyone totally alright with the spiders instantly? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVitas talks about the prisoners dillema, and how if how they want peace, then both sides have to want it, and work for it. It seemed to me that whilst the spiders would choose peace on their own, it was up to Holsten to choose peace on behalf of humans. Instead, he never really tries, and the spiders simply do all the work. They break the paradox, and force the humans to accept peace with the virus. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this just a really odd choice of narrative themes and payoffs, or am i missing something?",

        "text": "I found a video on YouTube a few years ago and it was one of my favorite sci-fi short stories but now I can't remember the name of it for the life of me. It started with a man who worked as a low level repairman of sorts on a space ship having a drink at the bar on board the ship. After a few minutes a man walked into the bar and everyone knew what he was and he seemed like a big deal. It turned out the other man who walked in is what they call a Lantern in the story. Lanterns were originally human but underwent massive surgeries and genetic augmentation in order to pilot the massive starships through light speed. The lantern sits down next to the low level employee and starts telling him about his job and how time means nothing to the lanterns and that they live forever and do what they want. The low level man is confused and doesn't know why a lantern is telling him all of this info and buying his food and drinks. Lanterns are the equivalent to rockstars but extremely reclusive. The lantern tells him about how time breaks down at faster than light speeds and when he pilots the ships they have to not only match the location but also the proper time when it comes to travel. The man asks him why he's telling him all of this sensitive info. The lantern tells him that he's been chosen for the lantern process back at earth and they're expecting him. In order to become a lantern you need very specific genes and things must line up perfectly when it comes to his job. The process of transformation is extremely painful and takes a long time but is eventually worth it. The low level man tells him he's not gonna do it and gives the lantern a few reasons. He asks the lantern why they would send one of them just to come tell him he has a spot open to become one of them. Why couldn't they send a message or something of that sort. He also tells the lantern that he's not gonna take the job cause he's already got big plans for tomorrow. The lantern tells him the exact time and place he will be waiting for him the next day so they can go to earth together. The lantern then tells the man exactly why the man doesn't wanna do it. Almost like he's reading his mind and knows everything about him. The man gets upset and scared and yells how do you know all of this about me. The lantern calmly looks at him and says \"it is tradition for us lanterns to recruit ourselves. Because time doesn't work the same for us we go find our younger selves and introduce ourselves to this life.\" \n\n\nI have no idea what the name of this short story could be and it's very frustrating. Please, if anyone knows the name of this story/video, let me know. Thank you in advance",

        "text": "I love scifi, it's my favorite genre just due to the extremely broad scope that it encompasses. I started getting some friends to read some with me as a sort of book group. The first story we read was the Hyperion series, which we all loved. After we finished that, we looked around and saw the 3 Body Problem being lauded as one of the great sci-fi books of our time. Well, we read the book, and none of us enjoyed it. Firstly, I did think the technical aspects were great (though I don't know if any of it was accurate, I'm not a scientist lol) but the writing itself and some story beats were just bad for me. \n\nFor example, when the main character (I forget his name) goes to the meeting with the 3 body devs he is immediately accepted into the secret organization simply because he agrees with their representatives once. I mean this is supposed to be an elite global organization and they let these people in after a single interaction (though tbf atp he had solved the first stage of the game) and surprise surprise, he's a spy. If that wasn't bad enough, at the meeting another character admits to murdering a fellow society member in front of a huge group of onlookers with very minimal prodding. For me, the decisions the people made just made zero sense and seemed to happen because the author wanted them to, not because they would actually happen that way. I also just found the writing itself sub-par, I'm not going to go back and find specific examples, but that's how I feel. \n\nI do know the author is Chinese, so maybe part of it is a cultural difference in writing style? Anyways I would love to hear from some 3 body fans as to why they enjoyed the book so much.",

He moved across the translucent film that was already marked with spiraling tracks. He stopped and pivoted, then gave a sideways shimmy before arching up and off of the film. The new marks were rapidly darkening where he had touched the film and the gathered students of language moved forward to watch the new words form.\n\nThree Shatar Sisters clustered together so they could touch antennas without disturbing the others. Their triangular heads tilted this way and that and their neck frills pulsed with interest. Two Gathering were sniffing at the edge of the film suspiciously. Or rather the Undulate admitted to himself, everything the stiff reptilians did looked suspicious to one of his kind. The two Trisk professors certainly found them flexible enough. The eight appendage professors were happily perched on the broad heads of the reptilians for a better view of the drying document.   A flight of Winged hovered over everyone’s heads, a constant cloud of movement.\n\n“Wasn’t Human First Brother going to be here?” one of the Shatar asked, twisting her head to the side and flicking her antenna at the door.\n\n“He was,” another answered. “I wonder if he forgot?”\n\n“Human Friend Obecny is not the type to forget an engagement,” one of the Trisk observed.\n\nThere was a rolling trill of assent from the flight of Winged overhead and the two gathering gave one of the wide variety of grunts that indicated they had no opinion on the matter. However the conversation was derailed by a massive thump that shook the door and the wall it was attached to. The Shatar stiffened and their frills snapped to full extension. The Winged flight swirled away from that wall before taking up a hold position facing the door with dozens of teeth gleaming in snarls. The Trisk gripped the heads of the Gathering as they heaved huge sighs and muttered something about lumbering mammals.\n\nRollsacross noted that the reptilians’ assessment was correct as the human in question fell through the opening doors with far more erratic velocity than was strictly usual for him. He was grasping a thermal canister in one hand which he brought up to his mouth in a mammalian hydration movement before he righted himself and reduced his swaying to a level that humans considered ‘still’.\n\n“Ahoj,” he greeted the room in general with a swing of his hydration canister. “Not too late am I?”\n\n“I  have just finished the first applied layer Human Friend Obecny,” Rollsacross said. “I am afraid you missed the explanation and the first application.”\n\n“Sorry,” the human said his mouth gaping in a yawn. “I over slept. My alarm was buzzing for a solid hour before it penetrated my skull?”\n\n“Did you not achieve proper sleep last night?” the Shatar, the medic asked.\n\n“Not a bit of it,” the human replied as he swayed closer to the three cousins.\n\nHis feet seemed to drag along behind his center of mass as he re-positioned himself in the room.\n\n“Was that a negative or a positive response?” The cousin pressed.\n\n“My babička called,” he explained. “One of the cousins is acting up over in the Grister sector and she wanted to let me know in case he swung though this system. We were talking for hours. You know how worried  babičkas get.”\n\nThe Shatar clicked in sympathy until Rollsacross shuffled back over to the tray of water and began explaining the increased difficulty of creating meaning on the third pass over a document.  The class fell silent and observed. Rollsacross finished the pass and invited them to examine it. There was the usual muttering until Human Friend Obecny suddenly failed to correct one of his forward sways and caught himself heavily on the table surface. The collected linguists stared at him curiously until the Shatar medic suddenly clicked in alarm.\n\n“Why are your irises oscillating like that?” she demanded, skittering forward to peer up into his eyes.\n\n“This writing,” the human said in an odd hollow tone. “It’s...it’s...I think it’s giving me a stroke!”\n\nThe medic’s frill flushed with horror and she grabbed his arm, clicking at him earnestly to follow her to the medical bay. The human obeyed after a moment but seemed unable to tear his eyes away from the drying Undulate script. When the door closed behind them one of the Gathering reached up to paw at his eye.\n\n“The human was simply being facetious, right?” he asked.\n\n“Of course,” the leader of the Winged flight snapped out. “A human would not have a stroke from simply looking at foreign script.”\n\n“That is my understanding,” Rollsacross agreed.\n\nThere was a long moment of silence before Rollsacross firmly brought their attention back to the lesson.\n\n# [Humans are Weird](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk) [​Book Series](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Barnes &amp; Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&amp;Ns=P_Series_Number&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n# [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&amp;fcsearchfield=Series&amp;seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&amp;fcshowpointsprice=no&amp;fcmaxprice=5&amp;fcminprice=0&amp;id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n# [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&amp;gl=US)\n\n# Please Leave Reviews on the Newest Book!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/c7d08fz31aga1.gif",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/10tup09/silly_old_bear_is_a_delightful_adaptation_of_the/",
        "text": "I am a lifelong fan of Winnie the Pooh. I grew up with the Disney cartoons, and watched the video tapes constantly. Well, when I wasn’t watching Thomas the Tank Engine or The Tales of Beatrix Potter, of course. Though I’ve gotten older, there’s still very much a special place in my heart for Winnie the Pooh. So, naturally, I leapt at the opportunity to Silly Old Bear. \n\nEdward J. Bear, known to his friends as Winnie the Pooh, lives in a house in the forest. He has many friends, such as Piglet, Rabbit, Owl, Eeyore, and of course Christopher Robin. There’s lots of adventures to be had for a bear of very little brain. Pooh and friends will learn many lessons, and have many laughs, during their (mis)adventures. So, why not journey into the forest, and send some time with everyone’s favorite silly old bear? \n\none fine and blustery day on Twitter, I saw a tweet. It was one of those “these people you follow also follow this” sort of tweets. It was promoting an upcoming audio drama called Silly Old Bear. It was to be an adaptation of the original Winnie the Pooh stories by A.A. Milne. It was created by Caroline Mincks, who has created several other audio dramas, such as Seen and Not Heard. There was only a trailer available, but I decided to give it a listen. It was love at first sound. The gentle, calming, whimsical music perfectly capture the spirit of Winnie the Pooh. That theme music always manages to put a smile on my face whenever I hear it. And then there was the actor who played the titular silly old bear. Ashley Hunt was obviously not copying the Disney version of Pooh, but my goodness, did he ever nail Pooh’s character. The entire trailer was less than a minute long, but I was sold. I eagerly awaited launch day. \n\nThe voice actors don’t attempt to copy the voice actors from the Disney cartoons. I suspect that this is done deliberately. That way, it helps to give Silly Old Bear its own unique identity. Well, that, and Disney’s legal team probably wouldn’t like it if Silly Old Bear sounded too similar to the Disney cartoons. The casting in Silly Old Bear also returns Winnie the Pooh to its British roots. The Disney cartoons used American voice actors, which has lead to the misconception that Winnie the Pooh is of American origin. To the contrary, it is quite British. In fact, A.A. Milne was considered one of Britain’s finest satirists and playwrights before he wrote Winnie the Pooh. \n\nThe cast of Silly Old Bear is a veritable who’s who of British audio drama voice actors.  We have among many others, Sarah Golding as the narrator, Felix Trench as Rabbit, and Karim Kronfli as Owl. \n\nOur title character is voiced by Ashley Hunt. He does an absolutely fantastic job of capturing Pooh’s child-like innocence and optimism. Piglet is voiced by Sophs Hughes, who uses they/them pronouns. They nailed Piglet’s nervous and perpetually paranoid demeanor. Their performance as Piglet was one of my absolute favorites of the entire cast. It was equal parts cute and hilarious. \n\nAnd of course I must give praise Ethan Hunt, son of Ashley Hunt, as Roo. What can I say? He is just utterly adorable. I see a very bright voice acting future for young Ethan.\n\nSilly Old Bear fills me with warm and fuzzy feelings, and always manages to put a smile on my face. It is an absolute joy from start to finish. It is an excellent audio drama for both the young and the young at heart. You certainly won’t want to miss it if you’re a lifelong Winnie the Pooh fan. \n\nHave you listened to Silly Old Bear?  If so, what did you think?\n\nLink to the full review on my blog: https://drakoniandgriffalco.blogspot.com/2022/11/the-audio-file-silly-old-bear.html?m=1",
