        "text": "Hello philosophers, I really don't know all that much about philosophy, but I've had this question that's been nagging at me, sporadically, for many years and I suspect it is philosophical in nature.\n\nIt is essentially a thought experiment:\n\n&gt; Let's say we had the means to experimentally split a human in two halves, and we cut a subject in these two halves. Presumably for a few microseconds, the subject's nervous system would still be active. Would the subject, subjectively, from the first person point of view feel itself conscious in the right or left half? Towards which side would it \"feel\" itself falling?\n\nI tried to ask a handful of friends what they thought about it over the years, and their answers were usually \"well the subject splits in two.\" But that doesn't seem to be a satisfying answer, it doesn't really answer what happens to the subject from the first person perspective.\n\nI was reading the Wikipedia article on \"the philosophy of self\" today and I think it helped me narrow down the question a little more, what I want to know, is what happens to _selfhood_ in such a scenario... You can't have a first person perspective of the world from two detached body halves... So what determines which half you continue to experience consciousness? And is a \"new self\" momentarily created in the other half?\n\nPerhaps you might have some reading material suggestions that explore this line of questioning, and how \"self\" experiences reality?",

        "text": "Surely God is absolutely just and He wants us to live in peace &amp; harmony on earth as it is in heaven?\n\n In a world in which billions of people adhere to religious orders supposedly based on divine laws, how is it possible there is virtually zero peace &amp; justice?\n\nIn the western secular world despite remarkable advances in technology &amp; communications how are people becoming increasingly isolated and rates of psychological disorders soaring? \n\nThe unnecessary burden on social services is huge at a time when most people are locked in a cycle of debt servitude over a place to live. Does it seem fair that the same hard work you do from one day to the next no longer buys you the same amount of bread?  \n\nDespite both parents working round the clock, there is barely ever enough money to make ends meet, and to provide the basic needs for our children. By the end of the day is there really any time left to spend quality time with our children? \n\nDo you recall that the bank notes you use everyday as legal tender state ‘I promise to pay the bearer on demand….’ actually have zero value and are printed without any link to a standard reserve. If everybody wanted to reclaim their assets at the same time there would be insufficient funds. Do we realise that every time we take out a loan we are paying back extra for our labour on funds that don’t even exist in the bank vaults? The bank can therefore decide to print money to create a free windfall with zero risk. Or on the flipside by restricting the flow of currency in the market to create a recession. In a domino effect when businesses struggle and living wages are cut people are forced to defer on house payments and families are strained to breaking point. \n\nWhile all this is going on behind the scenes we are forced into paying taxes to support military campaigns in countries to dismantle governments in nations whose people have done us no harm.  Who are usually the victims of such attacks other than the vulnerable poor and elderly? Whilst back home services for health, roads and education face regular cut backs. \n\nEven more shocking to us, is that we have been deceived into electing leaders in a so-called ‘Democracy’ with their manifesto promising to do the opposite and restore order and justice to our lives. Throughout the ages there has been an ever growing gap between rich and poor. With the mega rich Bezos, Buffet and Musk holding much of the purse strings, if 3 people did the same in your village preventing life saving medication from reaching dying children would you not demand intervention?  \n\nHistory is surely there to teach us lessons. If the system of rule in past nations such as Rome &amp; Greece democratic at their core, which grew to such an excess of liberty and abandonment of inhibitions before their demise, how would we expect anything different today? \n\nMarcus Cicero, a famous Roman statesman, willingly spoke out against rulers  eloquent in thier rhetoric about righteous conduct but failing to apply it in essence. He declared, ‘*There is no greater philosophy than the discovery of what our duties are to one another, to our communities, and to our God.*\n\nCicero recognised that the supreme goodness was in doing the right thing for the better of the community not in seeking pleasures for our own ends,’ *For he who posits the supreme good as having no connection with virtue and measures it not by a moral standard but by his own interests…….he could value neither friendship nor justice nor generosity; and brave he surely cannot possibly be that counts pain the supreme evil, nor temperate he that holds pleasure to be the supreme good.*\n\nIf as Aristotle said,  ‘Man is by nature a political animal’ how can we remain apathetic to this injustice to ourselves and our communities?\n\n ‘**No democracy can exist unless each of its citizens is as capable of outrage at injustice to another as he is of outrage at injustice to himself.’**\n\nPlato warned us that Democracy passes into despotism.\n\nHow can we forget Plato’s democratic analogy of the shipowner which represents the general populace, having no seafaring knowledge. The sailors are the politicians who vie for our favours, whilst the only man fit for the job of navigation known as ‘the philosopher king’ is left completely out of the picture. So what happens then when the storm rages and the boat begins to list?\n\nThe trouble is it seems people on the whole still want the sweetshop owner who offers seductive &amp; tantalising but short lived flavours, rather than the doctor with bitter but lasting wholesome remedies.\n\nOtherwise are we not destined to be ruled by the likes of Nero, who would willingly burn down his city to put an end to the revolt of the suppressed Christians and then use the people’s taxes to build ostentatious palaces to create his personal material legacy.\n\nLest we NOT forget that throughout history many wise men have come to teach us there is another way and it is not oligarchy, aristocracy, anarchy, facism, socialism, communism as in reality they are all schism. \n\nWere not the Jews expecting the promise of a messianic figure to rule as a King in the name of Jesus? Or in the Orient, Lao Tzu, who talked about a just leader who has a ‘Mandate from heaven’.  Whilst even former Kings of Europe spoke of ‘a divine right of kings’ men chosen by God because they had the only necessary abilities to manage the affairs of the people both religious and political.  What was the punishment for godly men who tried to claim their righteous position in previous generations? What was the end for Socrates who proposed this platonic system of just governance? Lest we make the same mistakes again?\n\n​​*Until philosophers are kings, …. cities will never have rest from their evils,—nor the human race, as I believe,—and then only will this our State have a possibility of life and behold the light of day.*” Plato, Republic Book 5\n\nSo logically if God is just he must have sent somebody for our time, so how can we find ‘The philosopher king’ of our age and a way out of the wilderness we find ourselves today? \n\nBecause surely if we tolerate the current status quo then can we truly expect any change in the future? \n\n “Tolerance and **apathy** are the **last** virtues of a **dying** society” Aristotle\n\nTherefore if we tolerate this then surely our children will be next……\n\nRecently we discovered the launch of a new book today’s ‘Philosopher King’ Aba Sadiq a.s the Goal of the Wise to help find a way out of the labyrinth we find ourselves in today…….\n\n[https://theahmadireligion.org/goalofthewise/](https://theahmadireligion.org/goalofthewise/)",

Since I were a child, my mind has always been set on finding that one meaning of life. After coming to the conclusion that life itself simply has no fundamental meaning, there was just one question that has always bugged me.  \n\n\nNow I might not be an American, my main language is not even english. However when I did study it for a project in high school, I couldn't help but notice the way Thomas Jefferson clearly stated mans rights to \"\\[...\\]Life, Liberty and *the pursuit of Happiness.*\".  It was almost as if happiness is something that can be sought out but never found. Can man embark on the journey to find this \"happiness\" that philosophers have always debated upon only to not find it in the end? Can he perhaps, even die of old age before he does?   \n\n\nAnyhow, I apologize if the question is not as good as some others here may be, I have not used this website before and I hope some of you might find it enjoyable to explore this dumb question I've had at the back of my mind for as long as I have known. I am only 16 years of age and have already started to believe I might just not find it myself. Although I really don't see myself as more intelligent than the average Joe, I thought talking about it with others may help me come to a better conclusion.   \n\n\nThank you a lot for reading all this if you have!

But what about a hypothesis that exists **before** data D but doesn't actually **predict** data D?   \n\n\nSuppose you are a Christian and you feeling depressed. You decide to read the Bible and the very first verse you read is about God sending down a sign to people he loves. That very same day, you play the lottery and ask God for help and you end up winning the lottery with a 1 in 1,000,000 chance. You start wondering if this is evidence of the Christian God intervening to help you out. Let's call this hypothesis H.\n\nNow suppose you are a person playing a game show. In this game show, you guess a number between 1 and 1,000,000. You are hoping you win. You guess it correctly. Suppose you come up with a hypothesis that there's some God out there who specifically helps you and only you during game shows, and that is why you won. Let's call this hypothesis H2. \n\nNote that the second hypothesis is completely post hoc. It was designed to accomodate the datum. The first hypothesis also seems post hoc yet not completely. The conception of a Christian God existed before the event. Him being a christian exised before that event. However, there is no prediction made within the conception of God or the Bible that says you would win the lottery. However, in your **head,** **before** the lottery's results were drawn out, you did technically **hope** that the Christian God would help you.   \n\n\nGiven that the chance of both events are the same, should each hypothesis be treated as equally ridiculous?

My question is two-fold concerning my approach.\n\n1. I bought Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview as a teenager and a few atheist who were very into philosophy (and wanting to encourage me to get into philosophy) said that outside of the Logic chapter (which they said is lacking) and the later chapters that are specifically on Christian/religious philosophy, that this was a solid introduction to philosophy. Is that true and considering what I'm doing below (in question 2) would it be worth to read the chapters on whatever topics I cover toward the end of covering the topic?\n2. Second question is if my approach seems good to tackling an introduction by myself: I found John Sanders introduction to philosophy course on YouTube so I started going through it and reading the texts for each class. However, I found that Gregory Sadler has an introduction course too (and I like him / the audio of his students is better). I also picked up a copy of Simon Blackburn's \"Think\" and I have a copy of John Perry's introduction to philosophy reader. What I've been doing / my plan is to: Follow Sanders' class &gt; read the text he provides &amp; watch the lecture &gt; then find Sadler's lecture(s) on the same topic and listen to it &gt; if the text introduces a particular topic cross reference Perry's reader to see if there's any other text I should read regarding that topic &gt; cover the topic in Blackburn's book &gt; reference Perry's reader and see if it includes any text recommended / mentioned by any of the former philosophers. I'm wondering if that's a good approach and if it's worthwhile to cover the topic in WLC's book at the end...\n\nI know this seems like a lot, but I'm not putting a timeline on readings and going about everything leisurely (and I've always wanted to get into philosophy). I want to take things slow and really try to understand before moving to a new topic. When I fancy, I'll start with Sanders. Whenever I want to read/listen again, I'll do the same thing with Sadler, when I when I'm ready, Blackburn, etc.",

Wouldn't the correct answer be yes? \n\nNow I suppose you could argue that it's important to understand why it's absurd to search for meaning, but if the question of meaning in life is absurd, then surely it's search for meaning or to explain meaning is also absurd, if that's the case then my question is;\n\nIf it is absurd to ask why we exist, but important to understand why, but the search for the answer as to why it's absurd is absurd itself then how can the book itself not be absurd?\n\n\n(I've got the Myth of Sis by Camus so if you have a part to revisit which I may not have completely understood, I'll reread.

The Moral Realist usually makes a case against the latter by saying that Epistemic Anti Realism is self defeating. Can someone explain why this is the case, or why not?

And I have such a specific view of the world and I’d like a label to put to it to help make my brain happy.\n\nI think reality is what an individual makes of it, therefore everything has meaning to them. I don’t feel like life is meaningless because my world is big to ME, so I heavily don’t follow nihilism. I don’t think anyone is right or wrong about anything. I use crystals and tarot cards, not *technically* because I believe in spiritualism, but because of what each crystal represents in my head, idk and idc if these crystals have some sort of energy, they might, I’ll never know. I just believe very strongly in myself, my own views of the world around me, and I know that that isn’t gonna be the case for other people. But I also believe that no one has all the answers, including myself. Absolutely no one knows everything. We think we know more than we do, which can honestly be kinda hard because when looking outside myself at religion or something, I just see this big, expanding world that we will possibly never know how to fully comprehend, so I don’t even try. Therefore, I can’t fully commit to any religious practice and fully believe in whatever I’m doing. If I do, I’m doing it based on what feels right to me, rather than what an old book is telling me. I’m gonna skip chapters and only follow what suits me, because everything is fucking subjective anyway. No one is right, no one is wrong. This gives me the freedom to not be stubborn in my beliefs and easily admit when I’m incorrect. I listen to other people’s views because I value the meaning it brings to them, even if I don’t agree. As long as people aren’t harming themselves or anyone else, idc if they believe that the world is run by a fairy goddess with green skin who controls the weather, because we don’t know anything as a species anyway, so why not just make everything about what will serve you to believe in?",

        "text": "this is what it said: \n\nExistence is a concept that refers to the state or fact of being alive or present in the physical world. It is an abstract concept that is difficult to fully understand and grasp, as it encompasses everything that exists and is real. However, it is often argued that existence cannot be fully understood unless one is able to stand outside of it and observe it from a perspective that is beyond it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne way to understand this idea is to consider the concept of reality. Reality is the sum total of all that exists, and it is what we perceive and experience through our senses. However, our perception of reality is limited by the fact that we are a part of it. We are trapped within the confines of our own existence, and as a result, we can only perceive and experience reality from a subjective perspective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis subjectivity can make it difficult for us to fully understand the true nature of reality and existence. We are only able to see and experience a small part of the whole, and as a result, our understanding of reality is incomplete. It is like trying to understand a painting by looking at only a small part of it. We can see the brushstrokes and the colors, but we cannot fully grasp the overall meaning and message of the painting without seeing the entire thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where the concept of being \"outside existence\" comes in. If we were able to stand outside of existence and observe it from a perspective that is beyond it, we would be able to gain a much clearer and more complete understanding of reality and existence. We would be able to see the whole picture, rather than just a small part of it. We would be able to see the interconnectedness of all things, and how everything fits together to form the grand tapestry of existence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, it can be argued that existence cannot be fully understood unless one is able to stand outside of it and observe it from a perspective that is beyond it. Our subjective perception of reality is limited by the fact that we are a part of it, and as a result, our understanding of existence is incomplete. By standing outside of existence and observing it from a broader perspective, we can gain a more complete and accurate understanding of the true nature of reality and existence.",

If I would have used a word like \"fuphilly\" which is a word that I just made up and it means exactly \"when something is not contradictory and also meaningful\", that word would have made my sentence incoherent, because it would have failed to convey meaning to the other person.\n\nI think you understand where im going with this, the meaning of all words rely on definitions which in themselves contain other words which also need definitions in order for them to convey meaning. \nSurely the words we use in ordinary language do convey meaning, but how? Is language a system which needs no fundament? I struggle to believe that. Do we reach the meaning of words through pointing at objects and their relations to other objects and concepts? \n\nThinking about this has me confused and I need recommended reading.

For example, your life would not be worth living even if the only bad thing during your entire life was that you stubbed your toe once. \n\nThreshold negative utilitarianism seems appealing to me, but it seems to lead to antinatalism since there certainly are people out there who siffer enough to hit the asserted threshold.

It seems as if this is so because we can't think of any good reason to suggest that it would indicate the existence of goblins. In other words, we can't find any good reasons.  \n\n\nSuppose you are now given another piece of data. You observe ancient drawings of goblins in a human cave. You observe that in this human cave, there are writings of human beings talking about the existence of goblins. You observe an entire book and catalogue talking about the types of goblins and how they only exist in a particular area. Does this count as good evidence to think that goblins exist? Most would say no. But assume that one doesn't say no. Assume one thinks \"Hm, it possibly might be evidence. After all, if goblins existed, you would expect humans to talk about them. Maybe it is a good reason.\" This person is not sure if this is a good reason. But because he is not **sure** that there is a good reason, even in this skeptical person's head, there exists no good reason in his head yet. As such, he ends up not believing in goblins.\n\nShould there be equal epistemic force in the belief of goblins based on these two states of evidence? Or should it be threshold based? As in, should \"I am sure that there is no good reason\" and \"I am not sure if this is a good reason\" function equivalently since either way, you not in an epistemic state of \"I am sure there is a good reason\"?

His definition is sort of vague and then goes on this elaborate and condense explanation. His example is pretty straight forward, he states, “Thus 'man' is a universal, 'Callias' a particular.”\n\nI’m currently reading Poetics and he says that poetry [narrative] should represent universals not particulars. \n\nNow given his example and definition of universals in De Interpretatione, I take that he means narrative should represent a kind of universal theme. Maybe I’m way off but I’ve asked two professors about this and they tell me they haven’t really studied Aristotle’s Poetics. So I’m sort of working through it by using his other works as a guide.\n\nI heard someone say Poetics is an easy read but I’m having a difficult time with it.\n\nAnyways, I’m assuming that he means narrative should follow a universal in the sense of something that everyone or at least most people can identify with. \n\nFor example, if you have a story about a man that is rich and stays rich well that’s sort of boring. \n\nBut if you have a story about a man that is poor and becomes rich. That’s interesting because most of us can identify—at least most people—with the idea of becoming wealthy. \n\nHe later goes on to talk about reversals which I assume would make the rich man once poor realize that he was rich all along because he had something that was more valuable than money. \n\nSorry for the long winded question. So, am I on the right track in thinking of universals in this sense?\n\nThanks :)",

Today, given that it is my luckiest day ever, I am convinced that I received divine guidance. After all, the probability of this happening **without** divine guidance is extremely and incredibly low.\n\nSkeptics will look at this event, smile, and say \"Well, at some time or another, events like these happen. Rare events happen all the time. It is thus no surprise that given the large numbers of opportunities there are for meaningful events to happen, even the most ridiculously improbable of events can happen.\"\n\nAlthough I had always accepted this kind of reasoning, when observing it a bit closely, there seems to be a fallacy here. The fallacy seems to be that this strategy can be used to dismiss **any** improbable event as being the result of design.\n\nWhen Alfred Wegener noticed that continents' outlines seemed to match each other and proposed the theory of continental drift, an extremely ardent skeptic could have said \"Well, given the trillions of planets that exist in the universe, sooner or later, one of these planets had to have continents that seemed to match each other's outlines by chance. As such, we cannot rule it out.\" Assuming that this sounds ridiculous to you, I fail to see how the logic of this argument is **any** different from the previous one.\n\nNote my question is about whether this **specific inference** is valid. I am not interested in knowing whether there are other reasons that explain why the continental drift theory makes more sense than God sending down a sign to me. There surely may be.

As a psychotherapist and program manager, I often need and am sought out for my ability to concisely ask good questions on complex matters.\n\nAsk work pressures mount I find that this skill in forming good questions is more necessary, and, more difficult to perform under pressure. \n\nThe following questions come to mind for this sub:\n\n1. How do you define and identify a “good question?”\n\n2. How has the study of philosophy influenced your ability to ask good questions?\n\n3. What heuristics or other guidance would you offer on developing one’s ability to ask good questions?",

        "text": "This is kind of a ridiculous question we got asked, but I agree it has some merit: \n\nSo a few years ago back in a philosophy class I took for college we got asked (As best I remember it): \"There is a bomb in the mall of America and you have the person who placed it's baby, but he will not say where the bomb is. What do you do?\" So one of the possibilities was to torture the baby and hope that the bad bomber guy gives up the location of the bomb. - Without much thought I blurted out that that was the option I would go with. Everyone looks at me like I have 3 heads. - I mean the baby did nothing wrong and in hindsight I feel like such an a\\*\\*. I also added that I did not believe the baby would even remember that happening to him/her. (I cannot remember being a baby myself) I think now that if the baby did remember it it would likely make for a much more dangerous situation because that baby would have that type of trauma and may end up a serial killer or a sociopath or something. The other students in the class really did not give their point of view and just kind of judged me. \n\nThis has been back on my mind a lot lately for some reason. I'm thinking that it may go back to that philosophical question of \"would you kill baby Hitler\"? - Would one life justify possibly saving thousands or millions of lives? Thinking of something else I learned from that class, is the best thing always the thing that helps as many people as possible?\n\nTo further this question a bit, what if Hitler ***definitely*** had a child and the allies were able to get ahold of him? IMHO I'm not even sure if killing Hitler himself at the height of the war would have ended the war. Nazi Germany had so many complicit people in it.\n\nI really am not sure what I would do now thinking about all of this. I can assure you I don't have the intention or desire to go around harming babies(or anyone for that matter). Like I said with further thought and insight, I feel that it's obvious that torturing a baby could turn them into a monster later in life and you are a bad person if you do that. But I feel potentially saving thousands of lives might outweigh that for me. \n\nOn another note: if you don't remember something at all did it really happen to you? (I have a very bad memory.)\n\nThis is a hard thing for me to fully wrap my head around and I don't want to feel like a d\\*\\*\\* for saying what I said. - What would some other people do? To me, this is not just black and white, there is a large grey area there.\n\nThanks - I am mainly asking because I would like differing points of view.",

Strawson, *Bounds of Sense*, p. 42:\n\n&gt;To abstract altogether from the idea of time, of temporal sequence, while preserving that of experience in general we may admit at once to be a task beyond our powers. We refer, in common speech, to moments of experience of a particularly elevated kind as “timeless” moments. But they are moments none the less, having their place in a temporal procession, followed and preceded by others. We could not otherwise conceive them as forming part of anything we could understand by “experience”. So the idea of experience in general seems to be truly inseparable from that of a temporal succession of experience.\n\nHas any philosopher discussed this issue? I'm an undergrad philosophy student thinking of writing an essay on this topic for a Kant course, but I can't seem to find extensive discussions on the plausibility of Kant's claim that time is a priori and thus necessary for experience.\n\np.s.
