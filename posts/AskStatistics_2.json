        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nas a fun side project, I decided to investigate the TV series AYTO (Are You The One?) from a bayesian perspective.\n\nAYTO is a TV series about 10 men and 10 women---all singles---who seek their 'perfect match'. Beforehand, a psychologist has matched them into 10 perfect matches but the candidates don't know their match. If all candidates find their perfect match, they win the prize. To find those matches, the TV show introduced the matching nights and the matching boxes. In a matching night, the candidates split into 10 pairs and are told how many of those pairs are 'perfect matches'. But they do not get told which of those pairs are 'perfect matches'. Furthermore, they can put a pair into the matching box and they are told whether this pair is a perfect match or not. During the show, the candidates are allowed to alternate between 10 matching box decisions and 9 matching nights. To win the prize, the candidates need to know all the perfect matches on the 10th matching night.\n\nThere are some works that investigated the problem from a combinatorial perspective. And surprisingly, this is sufficient in many cases to forecast the 10 perfect matches. The idea is simply to check which combinations of 10x10-pairs are compatible with the 9 matching nights and 10 matching boxes.\n\nI decided to consider the problem from a bayesian perspective. The idea is to consider the matrix $\\Theta \\in \\mathbb{R}{10 \\times 10}$, where $\\Theta\\_{i,j}$ represents the probability that woman Nr. $i$ is a perfect match with man Nr. $j$. Hence, $\\Theta$ should be a positive matrix, such that the row sums, as well as the column sums should add up to 1. The goal is to infer a bayesian estimate of $\\Theta$. To do so, I define the prior distribution of $\\Theta$ as a product of Dirichlet distributions, i.e.\n\n$$ \np(\\Theta) = \\prod\\_i p(\\Theta\\_i) \\enspace , \\\\\n\\Theta\\_i \\sim \\operatorname{Dir}(\\alpha) \\enspace . \n$$\n\nNote that this is a simplification since sampling from that distribution allows for realizations such that the column sum is not equal to 1 (i.e. the accumulated probabilities do not add up to one for a specific man).\n\nThe likelihood is modeled as a Poisson-Binomial Distribution, i.e. given $\\Theta$ and the matching night split, I model the distribution of having $j$ matches as the sum of binomial distributions with probabilities given by $\\Theta$ and the matching night split. For instance, let us consider the case of 4 candidates (2 men, 2 women). If the matching night split $S$ is man1-woman1, man2-woman2, then we model\n\n$$ \n2 \\text{ matches}\\vert S, \\Theta \\sim \\text{Bin}(\\Theta\\_{11}) \\text{Bin}(\\Theta\\_{22}) \\enspace.  \n$$\n\nTo get a point estimate for $\\Theta$, I just estimate the MAP. At the end, I collect all matching box decisions and set the corresponding $\\hat{\\Theta}\\_{ij}$ to either $0$ or $1$. After that, I linearily upscale so that the row sums are equal to $1$ again. To make a final decision for the 'perfect matches', I take the argmax'es of $\\hat{\\Theta}$.\n\nI implemented everything but unfortunately, the performance is just mediocre. The major problem is the following scenario. Imagine man a is convinced that woman b is his perfect match. So they pair for the matching night and are told that among those 10 pairs are 6 perfect matches. They continue to sit together in the next matching nights, which leads to a rise of the posterior distribution at $\\Theta\\_{b,a}$. If man a and woman b are no perfect match, we make a wrong, overconfident estimate. On the one hand, this is exactly what we want, right? The data gives evidence that if man a and woman b match for the matching nights, and are repeatedly told that there are many matches among them, those two might be a perfect match. Therefore, I am currently a bit clueless about how to solve this issue. Perhaps, a probability-driven approach is unsuited for solving the AYTO problem.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you have any insights, tips, or ideas on how to improve? I see multiple bottlenecks in my approach: i) The prior distribution is just a mere simplification of the 'actual' prior because I am using that mean-field approximation. In fact, rows of $\\Theta$ should not be independent. ii) I am using the matching box decisions as a postprocessing step after the MAP. Perhaps I could improve by incorporating it into the Bayesian framework.",

With one of my figures, I want to visualize the association between a set of biomarkers and a set of clinical features/conditions (e.g., stroke, dementia) to reflect how many reviews have been published on these associations. \n\nI have displayed clinical features on the x axis and the number of reviews assessing a particular phenotype on the *y* axis. In addition, on the x axis, I have separate bars per clinical feature for every biomarker, so my figure looks a bit like a stacked chart. Above bards, I have also added the number of studies supporting each association (as extracted from individual systematic reviews included in my overview).\n\nMy question is the following. I realize that some of the visualized associations are based on overlapping evidence.

I've mentally anguished over the proper perspective on how to schedule evenly (This is complicated by a disparity in what diagnoses each NP is open to treating). I've generally come about what I think is the right approach but I feel I have a large mathematical blind spot and I'm confident I'm missing something. I've settled on a month-based tracking system where each day, I write down the percentage that each NPs schedule was filled in and average it with the other days in the month. This way I can find out who's schedule is the most open on average relative to the hours they work in a day. I used percentages because the NPs all have different hours as well. So a provider who works a half day every day is going to be prioritized last in a fill-the-person-with-the-most-openings model.  \n\nStatistics discussion always has more nuance than my brain can comprehend though and as I average these schedules day by day, I get nervous that there's something I'm missing. I just want to be able to be called into my boss's office and defend myself readily. It's happened once before and my defense worked but I truly am interested in being as impartial as I can with this.  The NPs I'm working for, though, have very limited grace and are unsurprisingly self interested so I'm trying my best to anticipate objections to my model.",

It's a multicentric project recruiting using a non-probabilistic sampling method (convenience sampling). I know that this is really not ideal and can possibly make my results actually close to worthless, but this is what I have access to for my master's thesis and as long as I'm able to explain the flaws in my data, it won't penalize me.\n\nTo add more details; clinical manifestations of both the outcome and the predictors are dichotomous variables, stating the manifestation as present if the patient received a diagnostic at some point during his life. Some of the predictors have a risk to be severe, especially if they happen in infancy/early childhood. As such, some patients end up dying before ever getting the chance to be recruited in the study. Knowing that I want to know if those clinical manifestations can predict my outcome and that some patients die of these before having a chance to either be recruited or develop the outcome, I was wondering about the possible way this could bias the interpretation of my results.\n\nWhile thinking about possible biases that could occur in my analyses I came across both Neyman bias and competing risks bias. The way I understand it, competing risks occur when two possible mutually exclusive events can happen. Knowing that some of my predictors can cause death before causing the outcome I'm studying, my situation seems to fit with competing risks. But, while researching about it, it's mainly talked about when survival analyses such as Kaplan Meiers and Cox regressions are made. Is it because it wouldn't really cause a bias in logistic regression or because it has another name?\n\nAlso, Neyman bias seems to happen when patients are excluded because of the severity of their disease. This also seems to be fitting, since predictors possibly caused death before the patient had a chance to be recruited or to develop the outcome.\n\nI'm having trouble clearly separating both types of bias. Is it possible for both to be present, or am I maybe missing another type of bias that could result from my situation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your help!",

I know that Lasso tends to simplify models by arbitrarily selecting one variable out of a group of similar variables.

        "text": "__Introduction__:   \n   \nThe Triangular Decision Cycle Framework Diagram is a visual tool used to track the flow of data within decision cycles. It was originally developed as a theoretical framework. The TDCF builds upon the Decision Cycle Framework (DCF) by providing a visual diagram that tracks the flow of data in decision cycles. The DCF is based on the DTM, a framework that classifies data sources into three types: spatial, time-series, and information/hypothesis, and allows for nine possible combinations of these sources to be used in decision cycles.\n   \n__Data Sources__ (DS):   \n   \nRational Agents deal with different types of data sources: observations/actions in space (S), series of observations/actions over time (T), and information/hypothesis available to an observer (I). AIXI is an example of a rational agent. Spatial data, time series data, and information can all be represented as sequences, which can potentially match each other.\n   \n__Data Transfer Methods__ (DTM):   \n   \nThe data sources can be combined in nine different ways designated as \"Input→Output (Name)\" . For example:   \nS→S (Duplicate) - Photographing an object   \nS→T (Playback) - Playing a song from sheet music   \nT→S (Record) - Recording a song onto a record   \nT→T (Repeat) - Repeating an experiment   \nI→T (Explain) - Explaining a theory verbally   \nI→S (Depict) - Depicting a theory in a graph or writing it down   \nT→I (Build, Agile) - Building a project based on a theory heard in a meeting   \nS→I (Build, Waterfall) - Building a project based on a theory read in a document   \nI→I (Model) - Modeling a hypothesis, such as weather simulation.   \n   \nEach data transfer method has an associated ratio that measures the size of the input relative to the size of the output. These ratios are necessary for measuring different objects that perform DTMs. For example:   \nS→S (Duplicate): (input meters/output meters); scale - dimensionless   \nT→T (Repeat): (input seconds/output seconds); speedup - dimensionless   \nI→I (Model): (input bits/output bits); lossy compression - dimensionless   \nT→S (Record), S→T (Playback): (input meters/output seconds); velocity and inverse   \nT→I (Build, Agile), I→T (Explain): (input bits/output seconds); bandwidth and inverse   \nI→S (Depict), S→I (Build, Waterfall): (input bits/output meters); data density and inverse   \n   \n__Decision Cycle Framework__ (DCF):   \n   \nThe framework outlines a decision-making cycle that includes the following stages:   \nData Collection: Duplicating (S→S) or recording (T→S) data.   \nHypothesis Generation: Creating a theory based on the data, generating possible depictions (I→S) - AIXI brute forces this. A literature review can be included that listens or reads about prior theories (T→I) and (S→I).   \nTesting, Simulation, and Planning: Testing, simulating, and planning based on the hypothesis by creating a model (I→I) then recording data (T→S) (data recorded from the simulation).   \nCommunication: (optional) Verbally explaining the hypothesis to others (I→T).   \nImplementation: Playing back the simulation (S→T).   \nIteration: Repeating the entire cycle as needed by repeating the experiment (T→T).   \n   \n__Triangular Decision Cycle Framework__ (TDCF):   \n   \nThe TDCF is a graphical representation of the DCF that helps to visualize the stages of the decision cycle and their interconnections.   \nAssign {S, T, I} to the vertices of an equilateral triangle. For each DTM, let its coordinate be Input + Output. Now connect the DTMs at each stage, and connect the stages using arrows. There is now a triangle that visually depicts a decision cycle as a loop. This creates an equilateral triangle with the dimensionless DTMs at the vertices and the dimensional DTMs in between.",

        "text": "My lab is implementing a software package for data analysis. The PI proposed a statistical test and asked me to implement this test for public distribution in the package. I don't understand the theory behind the test. I have discussed this with him numerous times but we have not managed to see eye to eye. The PI is a lecturer in statistics and my knowledge of statistics is limited. I will provide more info/context upon request.\n\nWe have two random variables X1 and X2 taking values in a set G with \\~800 values, by construction these are closely related to each other. We have a data set of \\~120,000 observations (x1,x2).\n\nFor a given feature f : G \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}, we are interested in whether there is a correlation between f(X1) and f(X2) (is f sensitive to the relation between X1 and X2). For this we compute the Pearson correlation coefficient. Write c(f) for the sample\\_corr\\_coeff(f(X1), f(X2)).\n\nWe want to extend the test to give a nonparametric method for when f is poorly behaved, so we implement a permutation test. We choose 5,000-10,000 permutations \\\\pi of G and compute c(f \\\\circ \\\\pi) for all \\\\pi. If c(f) is in the upper 5% of observed values of c(f\\\\pi) we reject the null hypothesis that c(f) arose from a randomly selected function taking on the same values. This makes sense to me.\n\nNow given two features f, g : G -&gt; \\\\mathbb{R} which are potentially covariate we want to implement a nonparametric test to prove that c(f) has values above and beyond what would be expected given c(g). For this we choose 5,000-10,000 permutations \\\\pi of G and compute the pair (c(f \\\\circ \\\\pi), c(g\\\\circ \\\\pi)) for all \\\\pi. We plot a line of best fit to these points with the original pair (c(f), c(g)) omitted from the model fitting, and if the residual c(f) - \\\\hat{c(f)} is in the upper tail end of all residuals c(f\\\\circ \\\\pi) - \\\\hat{c(f\\\\circ \\\\pi)}, then we say f respects the relationship between X1 and X2 above and beyond what would be expected given c(g), i.e., c(g) does not explain c(f).\n\nI don't understand this.\n\n\\- Why do we omit the original pair (c(f), c(g)) when fitting the model  parameters beta\\_1, beta\\_0? My PI says it would be circular reasoning to include them, but imo the null hypothesis should be that (c(f), c(g)) is drawn from this distribution (across arbitrary pi) (with unknown parameters) so I think they should be used to fit the model. If c(f) and c(g) are both close to 1 and (c(f \\\\circ \\\\pi),c(g\\\\circ \\\\pi)) are far from 1 for random \\\\pi then it makes a big difference.\n\n\\- What is the meaning of the line of best fit here? If f is distributed as A \\*g + B + u for some small noise term u, then we will have c(f \\\\circ \\\\pi) \\\\approx c(g\\\\circ \\\\pi) for all pi, and the points (c(f\\\\circ\\\\pi), c(g\\\\circ\\\\pi)) will hug the line y=x.  But if the line of best fit is y = 0.4x+0.4 or something, how do we interpret this? Why would we fit a line with both \\\\beta\\_1, \\\\beta\\_0 free and not just \\\\beta\\_1?  Analytically it is difficult to understand how changes in f affect the output. Mathematically there seems to be no good reason to expect c(f\\\\circ \\\\pi) to vary linearly with c(g \\\\circ \\\\pi). I basically don't think it's sensible to regress out on c(g \\\\circ \\\\pi). We have not been able to come up with examples of a pair of distributions (f, g) where c(f\\\\circ pi) is distributed around \\\\beta\\_1 c(g\\\\circ \\\\pi)+\\\\beta\\_0 with beta\\_1 \\\\neq 1, \\\\beta\\_0\\\\neq 0.\n\nBasically I think that because c(-) is so nonlinear it does not make sense to plot a line of best fit and say \"c(f) is greater than would be expected given c(g)\".  On the other hand my PI sees this as a weak model assumption and thus more general because you're not assuming anything about f and g directly, only about c(f\\\\circ\\\\pi) and c(g\\\\circ\\\\pi). To me this has the drawback that even if f and g are related in a simple way, we don't understand how this relationship will manifest in c(f\\\\circ \\\\pi) and c(g\\\\circ \\\\pi). Is this test really telling us something mathematically meaningful about how f and g relate to the underlying variables X1 and X2? Does it make sense to regress out on c(g\\\\circ\\\\pi)?",

The way I have approached it is determining the probability that 63 and 64 are at least 32 spaces apart in the initial ordering. If they are 31 spaces apart, then they will meet in the 5th run (the 4 element list), and 64 will eliminate 63. \n\nThere are 64! different initial orderings.

I assume that only 12 months of data are available, I forecast months 13-32, and then compare actuals for months 13-32 with my forecasts for months 13-32. The data at hand shows the number of monthly deaths, starting with a fixed population at time 0, and it follows a nice exponential decay curve over time. Plot y-axis shows number of deaths, y-axis shows month elapsed since time 0.\n\nI’ve used traditional time series forecasting and have gotten good results with exponential state space models (ETS function from R package *feasts*), with results that encompass the variability I’ve seen with this type of data. But I’m exploring other methodologies and am currently studying survival analysis, since I have a lot of variables that correlate with the probability of death. So far in survival analysis I see that it is very useful for showing any effect of those variables on death rates (multivariate analysis, etc.), but at this stage I’m only interested in forecasting and simulating future curve paths in the hypothetical scenario of only having a partial curve to work with. Is survival analysis appropriate for forecasting from a partial curve? If so, how does one forecast future curve shape using survival probabilities and hazard rates (ignoring the variates)? Are there other methodologies I should be exploring?\n\nThe below images show the survival probabilities plots, and the ETS model forecasts, with this dataset.

It's like assuming a sample size for rolls that haven't happened yet.\nMaybe a better way to put it is, \"Am I more, less, or equally likely to roll at least one 6 on 6 dice as I am to roll one die 6 times and get a 6? Why is that answer the case?\"\n\nI can't figure out how to notate the difference, which makes me think there isn't one - but I vaguely remember doing this in college years ago, and I remember there being one.
