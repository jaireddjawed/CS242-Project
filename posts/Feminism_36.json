        "text": "I work in a male dominated industry (finance) and until 4 months ago, was the only woman in my whole office. \n\nEarlier today one of my bosses told me my demeanor was “too cold”. The reason? I never use exclamation points in my emails. I was so shocked by his “feedback” that I just quietly thanked him then went back to my desk. I wanted to march back in there and chew him out because the double standard he is holding me to is almost baffling. I know several of my other coworkers act in a similar way, but they will never be told what I was. This isn’t the first time I’ve been told something like this. Thankfully never gotten the “smile more!” comment, but definitely words in a similar vein. This is my first real world job and I love my field but now I feel like even if I hit all my marks, there will always be some weird misogynistic that will continue to knock me down. \n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to handle this? I’m now nervous that my review will be impacted because I’m not a very bubbly, giggly person. I try to maintain professionalism in all aspects of my job, as required. Part of me wants to cave and start using the god damn exclamation points just to protect my position, but the feminist in me wants to release frogs in his office before I change who I AM to fit HIS expectation of how I should act. \n\nSending good vibes to all.
