        "text": "Typed on phone so sorry if there are errors and formatting issues.\n\nSo we went to our local mall to get some shopping done.  While my [39M] wife [39] and daughter [7] were waiting for me to get a hair cut, they grabbed some snacks and waited by a lounge area near the barber shop.  I finished and saw them waiting near the barber shop because while they were eating snacks, some older lady decided to sit down right near them and decided that this was the optimal place to clip her finger nails.  She proceeds to start clipping her finger nails with of course, the pieces flying towards my wife and daughter.  My wife was so angry that all she could say was “Ewww, that’s disgusting” while fleeing the mad carnage of flying finger nails with our daughter in tow. \n\nA few days later, we were back at this same mall, nothing too crazy like finger nail shrapnel, but again, while I was at the dentist, my wife and daughter were shopping at a makeup store in the mall.  The one that rhymes with “Adora”.  Well, as she moved to go pay, she enters the winding line-up queue (if you are familiar with this store, they have bins all around the queue with impulse buys) and comes up to two people looking at items in the impulse bins. She stops as these two entitled princesses are blocking the path.  She politely asks them if they are in line and one of them looks up at my wife and gives her this really angry “don’t look at, or talk to me you lowly peasant” glare.  Thankfully, the cashier sees this exchange and waves my wife through to come up and pay. All my wife and the cashier could do was look at each other and wonder what was so offensive about my wife’s question.  \n\nSeems like these amazing experiences never happen when I’m around...",

        "text": "This is an update to a rather weird scene I had witnessed a couple of days ago, which I had posted here[https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/9j0jz6/entitled\\_douchebag\\_asks\\_for\\_a\\_replacement/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/9j0jz6/entitled_douchebag_asks_for_a_replacement/)\n\nQuick Summary of events - lady I call Totally Bananas (TB) bought an expensive notebook at a stationary shop I was in, and dropped it in a puddle as soon as she stepped out of the store. Came back in and demanded a replacement for the ruined product, then a refund, and then threatened to call the police.\n\nSo I finally had reason to be back on Campus yesterday, and so went and asked the shop owner (SO) as to what had happened. He had a nice laugh about it, and told me, but I do want to clarify that I haven't witnessed literally any of this. This is purely second-hand based on what I was told by the owner of the store.\n\nTB it seems did not call the police. What she did do, was call her father, lets call him Totally Banana's daddy (TBD). TB and TBD returned to the store relatively early the following day, once again seeking to squeeze money out of the owner.\n\nSo SO tells me that TBD claimed to be a lawyer. Walked in, informed SO that as a lawyer, he could make life very difficult for SO if SO did not immideately replace the ruined notebook AND on top of that refund his precious daughter for it.\n\nSO's response was pretty much along the lines of \"Piss off\"\n\nTBD starts to get somewhat hysterical, wanting SO to understand that he's a powerful man, that he knows people, that many of the local police are his friends.\n\nThis is the part where the SO got more gleeful when telling me the story. TBD it seems concluded his extortionate rant by basically telling SO something along the lines off \"I'm pretty powerful, and you have no proof for any of your claims, so nobody will believe you, over respectable upper middle class folk such as us\"\n\nSO tells me that he used this opportunity to tell TBD that in-fact he did have proof in the form of a CCTV recording. Moreover, unlike most CCTV systems, his also recorded sound, so the whole conversation with his daughter, as well as his current conversation were on record. And that he'd be happy to show TBD the recording of his daughter's threats and ruined product return attempts.\n\nTBD and TB upon hearing that there were in-fact recordings, and with sound, it seems turned interesting and contrasting shades of white and red, before both flouncing out of the store. Oddly enough, as soon as they left, TBD began yelling at TB for embarrassing him! (Why do people think that yelling loudly as soon as you exit a store and close a door means nobody can hear you?)\n\nAs you can imagine, SO was quite delighted in being able to recount this update to me.\n\nPS: A little context on the store layout might help. The cashier's desk is basically right opposite the door of the Store. The Camera I noticed sits above the entry door, and there's a small computer facing the cashier which displays the feed from it (also another camera towards the storage area of the store) Since the desk is at an angle, whether you can see the feed or not kinda depends on how you stand . When I looked at the feed, you can see yourself, and anybody entering and exiting the store or making a payment. What you would not be able to see would be the credit card-machine, because the paying customer's body blocks, but you can certainly see any products put on the cashier's desk.\n\nAll in all, I think its a beautifully laid out security system.",

        "text": "In a not so comedic comedy of errors...  I wouldn't think that trying to buy a new refrigerator would become a month long journey into the depths of how to try to screw over a customer.  However, when trying to purchase just such an item from a national home improvement store that did indeed succeed in giving me the Lowest of expectations for them in the future, here is a story for your amusement.   \n\nOne sees a refrigerator that is desired.  One places the order on-line and is told it will be delivered through the local store.  Credit card gets charged for the appliance and for haul-away.  \n\nA week later, on the set delivery date, there has been no communication from the store itself.  We call.  And of course get told... the order was never placed.  For that thing we ordered.  And were charged for.\n\nNo problem!  Store staff will place the order now.  Delivery will be in 2 weeks.  A week goes by and being somewhat skeptical of this business at this point, the order is checked.  Funny, online, it says the order has been delivered.  Call the store again.  \n\nAnd once again - that order was never placed.  We can take of that now!  It will be here in a week.\n\nAnother week and... let's hear it for consistency!  No appliance, no communication.  Call the store again.  Well - it says here is was delivered.  Yet amazingly, it was not.  Cancel the order, please refund our money.  Ummmmm - we'll have to get the store manager to call you back to do that.\n\nFollowing day, store manager calls - are you sure you didn't receive the appliance?  Yes, amazingly, astoundingly sure.  Well, we need to look into that.\n\nAfter another week of weekly calls and it \"being looked into\" the manager says, sure, we will refund your money.  For the appliance itself only.  Not for delivery or haul-away.  We never refund those.\n\nOkay, well enjoy my formal complaint to corporate and to the Better Business Bureau and me disputing the charge through my credit card.  \n\nSeriously, what kind of screwed up logic is it that you're not going to refund all of the money for the product and services that you Never Delivered or provided??  This wasn't a restocking issue, nor a we changed our minds issue.  You straight up did not come through on your half of the agreement but you want to keep the money?  Never shopping there again.",

        "text": "So, as I was starting UNI in the UK and I had no decent laptop to use for school and creative purposes (video editing etc) so I decided to splurge a bit on a 1600£ laptop. I ordered it and it arrived the next day via one day shipping, I picked up the package from the reception at my student dorm, and almost threw the package over me when picking it up as it was as light as air, I was confused but didn't think much about it, so I headed back to my room to open my new tech goodies.\n\nI open the package and im dumbfounded at the fact that I got sendt a pillow instead, some memory foam contour pillow. I head onto the website and request a return and stating the fact that I received a pillow instead of my laptop, assumed the process would be quick and I would get my laptop in the next few days (Spoiler, I didnt get my replacement laptop).\n\nSo to return it I need to print out a return label, so I walk down to my UNI, (30 mins) get it printed, walk back, slap it on the package and place it in the reception where it would be picked up. Next day arrives, it dosen't get picked up, I sigh and contact support via text chat, they tell me they order a new pickup for the day after, and assure me I dont need to replace the label. I trust them, and leave it in the reception, I also informed the receptionist of this so they would make sure it wasn't missed. it gets picked up the next day, (the receptionist indeed needed to remind them to pick it up). Im happy to see that stupid pillow gone from my sight. and I assume the ordeal is over. NOPE, next day, I get notified by the reception that the pillow is back. They really want me to have this pillow huh. \n\nI call them this time, schedule another pickup, nothing happens the next day. I open another text ticket, I, for the third time, have to explain this entire situation, to each and every representative I get forwarded to. they assure me it will be picked up this time, and I need to print a new label. I get it printed, it gets picked up, I dont see it again\n\nSomewhere inside this giant mess, I figure out that im not getting my replacement laptop, as that pillow appears to have been the last in stock laptop (prolly misplaced in the storage). I decide that im gonna take my money elsewhere, so I take the money out of my savings account (planning on placing the refund back in the account), And try to order somewhere else. this didnt work, as apparently other places dont like my International bank card. so im forced to buy a different laptop from the original retailer.\n\nForward one week, which was yesterday, I get a notification that they have received the package. I check the update page, and it states \"replacement requested\" when I, two times already, asked them to change it as I ordered a different laptop. and this conversation here proceeds. Starring, ME, as Me, RR as the retail representative, and RR2 as the second Retail representative\n\nME: \"Hello, my name is ME and my laptop still has the replacement requested when I asked for it to be a refund instead, this is my order numer: XXX-XXX\"\n\nRR: \"thank you for contacting support, I understand you want a refund instead of a replacement, il have this fixed in no time. Please confirm, is this the item you want a refund on *Laptop*\"\n\nME: \"Yes, correct\"\n\nRR: \"let me transfer you over to the refund department, thank you for your patience\"\n\nRR2: \"I've checked the status and see that you've not returned the original item due to which we're unable to refund the order.\"\n\nME: \"I got an email X hour ago that you received my return\"\n\nRR2: \"We have received it, but this item was not in the original order.\"\n\n(BTW, this line here, triggered all the built up rage I had built up in this entire case)\nME: \"That IS MY ORIGINAL PROBLEM, I GOT SENDT A ***** PILLOW INSTEAD OF THE 1600 GBP LAPTOP I ORDERED\"\n\nRR2: \"Please return the original item and once the item is returned the refund will be processed.\"\n\nthen I proceed to re re explain the entire situation again, that i received the wrong item. This here finally put stuff into motion and I got an email earlier this morning that my refund it being processed and expect the money back within 3-5 days.\n\nNow that its over (I hope), I can look back at this and laugh at how bizarre this entire ordeal has been, and here's a few notes: I do not get angry, it takes a lot to piss me off, the last time I was even remotely close to as angry as I was during this case, was 5+ years ago. Also, conversation cut out alot of filler text to conserve this already massive post. Also some of the time span during the return ordeal might be mixed up or wrong as i am writing this from pure memory. I ordered the laptop on the 11th sept, and I got the final email about it today, the 28th\n\nTL:DR Retailer sent me a cheap pillow, instead of my expensive ultra-book laptop, it took one and a half week of attempting to get them to pickup the pillow for the return, then they tell me they cant refund me because I didn't return the item I ordered. I yell at them and the refund gets processed",

She's around 60 &amp; has this demeanor of having had the life sucked out of her and replaced with burning coals of bitterness and hatred for all living things. Like jesus kicked her in the face as a child and told her nobody would ever love her. But whateves I've worked at plenty of gas stations, &amp; I know that life, so I really feel kind of sorry for her. \n     On this day, I decided to try a sandwich place breakfast sandwich for the first time. She's obviously agitated, like she decided to try a coke and steroids breakfast. \"What do you want?!\" she barks at me, \"just a breakfast sandwich, I've never had one.\" \"Well what do you want on it?! Sausage, bacon, WHAT?!\" \"I'll go with bacon.\" She starts slamming things around, rolling her eyes, tsk-ing \"Well, what kind of bread?!\" \"What kind of bread do you have for the breakfast sandwiches?\" This just pushes her rage buttons even harder &amp; she yells out all the bread options.  I chose flat bread. This did it for her. It was too much. \n     She throws her arms around like an angry, broken windmill \"WELL NOW I HAVE TO GET IT BECAUSE IT'S IN THE FEEZER!\" She continues to yell at me as she storms off to the freezer, \"SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT!\" So, at this point I'm feeling really uncomfortable. This is beyond rude, she's literally on the verge of a meltdown, and it's starting to get scary. \n     I handle this situation by passive aggressively retaliating.  I let her start my sandwich. When she's almost done, I say I forgot my money in the car &amp; drive off. So she stands there, looking stupid, waiting on me to come back so she can finish my sandwich. \n     Later on, I ran into the girl that was working with her that morning, and she told me that rage lady stood around for about 15 minutes before realizing I wasn't coming back, &amp; apparently this pissed rage lady off pretty bad. She explains that rage lady was having a bad day. I responded, to summarize, idgaf, her problems aren't my problems, and I'm not buying food from some lady who is banging dishes around and raging at me for trying to buy a sandwich, and I was glad I ruined her day, that was my intention. Fuck your feelings sandwich place rage lady!",

It's great.\n\nI decided I was too lazy to cook food one day and called the pizzeria to order. I asked if they were still open (it was around 9-ish) but the lady on the phone, the owner's wife, said no. I thanked her and hung up. A few minutes later, I get a call back from a random number. It turns out that this number was the personal phone number of *the owner himself*, who said that he will personally make and deliver the pizza. Sure enough, 20 minutes later he's at my door with a pizza box.\n\nTo this day I still can't believe the restaurant not only called me personally, but extended their hours to make food for a regular.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/9j76qv/tried_to_cancel_my_gym_membership_the_other_day/",
        "text": "According to the terms and conditions of the membership agreement you have to do one of two things to cancel your membership:\n\n1. Complete a cancellation form, or\n2. Send written notice of cancellation by prepaid registered mail \n\nBoth require that notice be given 30 days prior to your next dues date, and notification has to be made to the studio you signed up at. It’s that easy… until it’s not.   \n\nI went with option #2 to cancel my membership because I hate situations that I know are going to result in awkward interactions of up sell attempts. No, I don’t want to downgrade, and no I don’t want to freeze my membership. I want to cancel it the fastest and faceless way possible, and I don’t want to talk about why.   \n\nSo I send my written notice of cancellation by prepaid registered mail (henceforth referred to as “the letter”) on July 23rd. On July 24th I get an email from the Manager saying they just received the letter and:  \n\n* Would love feedback why I want to  cancel  \n* Can downgrade my account, but also have a freeze option\n* If I want to “go ahead” and cancel, they’ll use my next dues date of July 26th as my 30-day notice  \n* Need for me to confirm my request to cancel so my membership can be adjusted accordingly, AND\n* That there’s additional paperwork to be completed depending on what I choose to do.\n\nThinking that perhaps I missed something, I went back and re-read the terms and conditions of the membership agreement and then I read them again just to be sure. Now I’m no lawyer but I do know my way around terminology used in things like agreements, contracts and legislation, and the key word in the cancellation clause I was reading was ‘or’. What this means is that no matter how many options you’re given to achieve a certain outcome, if the second to last option provided ends with ‘or’ then only one of those options is required to be completed. However, if the second to last options ends with ‘and’ then you’re required to complete all of the options listed. To say it differently: you can do this OR this to reach the outcome you desire, versus you have to do this AND this to reach the outcome you desire.  \n\nSo I ignored the email expecting to be charged my last round of membership dues on July 26th and believing that the letter I sent was pretty cut and dry as far as my intentions go. Fast forward to August 28th. I’m reviewing my credit card charges and see that the gym applied membership dues on August 26th. I do the “30-day prior to” math and conclude that my membership should have been terminated on August 22nd. I email the Manager asking for an explanation. I receive no response. On September 4th I send another email indicating that I’ve been in contact with my credit card company and will be disputing this and any future charge if an explanation isn’t provided as to why my membership wasn’t terminated when it should have been. I get the following response, which I’ve condensed: \n\n*Your cancellation letter was received. I e-mailed you to confirm your cancellation and also said there was further paperwork to complete the cancellation or downgrade your membership as I provided another option to cancelling. I never heard back from you nor received the proper cancellation form so your membership was not terminated. This would explain the August membership fee that was withdrawn from your account. I’ll refund the last payment providing the attached cancellation form is completed and returned. No need to dispute the charge. I will refund once I receive your form.*   \n\nI again go and read the cancellation clause in the agreement, and then I scour the gyms website (both public and member only) to find where it says that, IN ADDITION TO the letter I sent in accordance with the terms and conditions OF THEIR agreement, I ALSO have to fill out and submit a cancellation form. Yeah, spoiler alert, it doesn’t exist. I respond explaining what ‘and’ vs ‘or’ means, provided a reminder that my responsibility to them ended on July 24th when the letter was received, won’t be filling out any additional forms, and would be disputing all charges made after July 26th. \n\nNo response was received and as of today there is a charge pending on my credit card for Septembers dues. \n\nMy advice to everyone in every situation where a monthly charge is being applied in return for some sort of membership:\n\n* Read what you sign and know, as much as possible, what you're getting into  \n* Never leave without a copy of what you've signed\n* Keep a copy of everything you've signed, always\n* In the event of a dispute, correspond in writing, always    \n\ntldr; it's always easier to sign-up than it is to cancel. Keep everything and only correspond in writing. \n\nUPDATE: received word from the gym today that they're refunding the charges from August and September. They also had this to say: *I want to apologize again for the miss communication in regards to cancelling your membership. I  do not want you to think negatively about* (name removed) *or our studio in particular.* *We are simply following Corporate protocol*.  Corporate protocol being to require addition cancellation requirements that are not stated OR outlined in the membership agreement.",

She pays up and goes outside. Let's call this person TB for Totally Bananas\n\nNow just for some context, it's been raining and so it's all muddy and wet outside. Also the store has a glass door. I'm not paying attention to why exactly it happened but very visibly to everyone in the store, TB manages to drop her fancy notebook into a puddle of muddy water. If that isn't enough, she stands there cloudly cursing for a few seconds, meaning everyone (store manager behind the cashier desk, two assistants and three customers including me) looks up. While EVERYONE is watching, TB picks up her book and comes back in.\n\nTB: Hi, I've changed my mind about this notebook, I'd prefer one with a different design.\n\nCashier/Manager: I'm sorry, but you've paid for it and I can't replace it since you've ruined it now.\n\nTB: No you don't understand I *just* bought this. I want a different design. Nothing has changed.\n\nC: Ma'am I can't. You've muddied it, and the paper is ruined. This can't be exchanged.\n\nTB: Urgh this store is horrible. Fine then I don't want it, give me a refund.\n\nC: No refunds either. Please understand you've ruined the product.\n\nTB now starts ranting, claiming the people have scammed her, that she just bought this and she's entitled to a refund and how can they do this to a paying customer.\n\nMe: lady you dropped this in mud, nobody would refund that \n\nOther customer at the same time: the cashier is right, he can't refund you.\n\nTB: what is this scam? You're all crazy. I'm going to the cops and flounces off.\n\nCashier looks bemused for maybe five minutes before he goes back to processing the rest of us while we're all laughing. He does tell one of the assistants to pull the cctv recording and save her visit, so I'm going to have to go back in a few days to see if she was actually stupid enough to go to the cops.\n\ntl;dr Crazy woman ruins purchase, demands replacement/refund.\n\nPS: on phone so forgive any formatting issues. Also I'm paraphrasing the conversation from the mixture of Hindi and English it actually took place in.\n\nUPDATE: Story follow up is now live.",

The manager tells him not to do it again.\n\nThis guy flips out. He starts screaming and cursing and pacing around. The manager and other employees are asking him to calm down because he is making a scene in front of customers. He screams in their faces and stomps out of the restaurant. Then back in. Then out again. All while yelling and cursing.\n\nFinally the manager tells him to go home. It was like the lightbulb went off in his head that he'd crossed a line. He tried to go back to work but they won't let him back behind the counter. He finally leaves and sits in the parking lot smoking.\n\nOf course he's sitting by car as I'm leaving. He smiles at me and tells me to have a nice day. I have poor impulse control so I blurted out, \"what is wrong with you?\" and then left.\n\nMaybe he was a bad employee.

It’s close to closing time, so we try to check just in case someone turned it in. The bar staff and DJ were very helpful, but no luck. We’ve been calling my phone with no answer. We try one last time and this time, it’s sent to voicemail. This confirms my fear that it was stolen. \n\nI arrive at home. Having no phone, I report things online vs. calling. My bank card has already been used. I flag the transactions. I’ve done what I can, now close to 3am, I finally get to sleep. \n\nThe next day, I go get a new cell phone and call the bank. They request the police report for the fraudulent, or stolen, money. I call the police. They say they’ll come by to get a report. I live on the outskirts of this college town. I’m sure they’re not looking forward to driving to my home. I get a call back and they begin asking questions. \n\nAfter discovering I had been drinking, they say, *”there’s a different between lost and stolen.”* \n\nI could have sworn when someone uses your bank card without permission, that’s stealing (and later try to activate your “found” cell phone). \n\nI called my bank back and explained what happened. Since the charges weren’t over a certain amount, they let the police report go. \n\nA little different, but I’d say I’m a customer to my local police force. The irony that my bank, cell phone provider, bar staff and DJ provided better customer service. In the age of #whyididntreport, I hope my city police department treat ~~women~~ victims of more violent crimes (in a college town) with more respect. \n\nEdit: someone brought to my attention that it shouldn’t be “treating women”, it should be victims as a whole. \n\nAlso, this was too long ago to report now. I wish I had of pushed it, but at the time I was so stressed with the rest of it, I didn’t want to add to my stress. ",

It never arrives. I use a fake name.\n\nToday I needed to make a last-minute hotel reservation. Obviously cannot use fake name. Arrived at hotel this evening and I can't check in. It's coming up with an error on the automated check-in, \"error, please contact staff\". So I find a member of staff and she immediately goes, \"oh wait, are you SpongeBob Squarepants? Errrr yeah, we cancelled your reservation, we thought it was a prank\".\n\nOk. So this is not the first time this has happened. I'm cool with it so far though: clerical error, right? I mean, you've put a hold on my credit card _that I gave you when I reserved the room_, to the tune of £200, but I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. Also you could have called the telephone number you _required on booking_ but maybe you forgot?\n\nSo however it happened, because the entire reservation got cancelled, I'm now treated *as a walk-in*. So it's a higher rate. So they ask me, \"how much were you quoted for the booking?\" Err £x, I say. \"Oh, we can only comp you one breakfast, so that should bring it down a bit: it will just be £6 more than you'd have paid anyway.\"\n\n\"OH ALSO. We are oversold. So the room we are giving you is one which was put out of service because the last person smoked in it. It still smells a bit. We've left the window open all day though. Is that ok?\"\n\nErrrr. So you've cancelled my reservation, given my room away and are now charging me more for the privilege? Ok sure. Just give me the key. I'm too tired for this shit right now.\n\nHere's the thing though. I used to work front desk on a hotel. I'd have been MORTIFIED if this had happened to a guest. Absolutely fucking mortified. Even if wasn't remotely my fault. I'd have showered the guest with apologies and at least a drink on the bar, if not compped the stay. These guys are sitting in front of me discussing how to comp \"just enough\" to the room to bring it down to the price stated in my booking confirmation. While I'm waiting for my key.\n\nFuck me.\n\nSweet dreams.",

        "text": "Happened a few weeks ago. On mobile. Yadda yadda. \n\nI just recently moved and needed to get WiFi for my new place. At my apartment complex you can only get from one provider. I wasn’t happy about it but so it goes. I am a student so I went online and was quoted a student price that somehow cable and WiFi was cheaper than just WiFi, begrudgingly I accepted. \n\nWell I get an error message that they need to verify I’m a student. So I call and go through the process. They verify I am a student and I’m ready to give my card info and seal the deal. Well the rep on the phone tells me to hold up because they no longer provide to my building. \n\nWell several phone calls and transfers later I am back to square one. The company is the only one that provides to my apartment and I need to buy from them. 12 hours later. The student deal disappears. I’m told it’s never ever a thing and that I have to pay full price. She even goes as far as to tell me that they don’t have a department that handles student deals and she can’t help with that because she thinks it’s made up. \n\nWell I’m pissed and I’m sending the emails of my student verification and the package I’m quoted on to prove I’m not making anything up. After two hours on the phone; I swallow my pride and some Advil for my headache, and go with the next best deal they offer. It’s $20 more a month but I get some free installation or some BS. \n\nWell the woman tells me she can’t make the sale for me I have to make it online. After explaining to her what she’s offering me isn’t online she tells me she can’t make a sale and I’m in my own. I try to explain to her all I see online are packages for significantly more than what she quoted me on and ask her where I can find her package that she quoted me on. She told me that it’s very clearly on the website and I must not be “very bright” if I can’t find it and it’s my fault I’m in this situation because I should have bought the package earlier and like my student deal the deal she has must not be offered any longer because I took too long. \n\nNow I’ve spent two hours with this woman on the phone explaining to her that I tried to purchase the package yesterday and they wouldn’t service me. I did not enjoy being talked to like that.  I’ve worked in the service industry, I know how bitchy customers can get and I always try to be polite. I felt like I was being taken advantage of. \n\nSo after she keeps telling me she can’t make a sale for me, I reply \n\n“What department am I talking to”\n\nHer: “sales”\n\nMe: “so the sales department doesn’t actually make sales??”\n\nThe woman gets all upset with me and keeps blaming it on me. Now usually I would take my business elsewhere, but I’m in a bind. So my next request was to speak with someone who was authorized to make this sale for me. She said she had a supervisor I could talk to that could help, but he was out of the office. She gave me his number to leave a message. \n\nI call the number. \n\nIt’s spam. She gave me a spam number. Now I am FURIOUS. I’m going on hour three with this and have just about lost my patience. I call the company back and try to remain calm. All I want is to speak to someone that can help me and explain to me where I can find these deals because maybe at this point I am dumb and just need help. \n\nHappy ending is I am now writing this post with WiFi. None of it was actually my fault. A sales rep was able to help me and make the sale for the original quoted student price over the phone with the help of a student deals representative. Still deciding if I should file a complaint about the original representative seeing as I still get a spam call from the number at 4pm each day. \n\nEdit: filed a report on her, they said they would follow up. Will keep you informed if anything happens. ",

        "text": "On my previous post, someone (sorry I forgot your handle) mentioned how they had been invited to a suite and the people there had been slobs. It reminded of an incident a few years back when I was also invited to a suite. \n\nMy boyfriend was working with a company that did a lot of PR events, so they gave my BF tickets to their suite. My BF and I live in a very big city, and these tickets were at World Famous Arena so I can't even imagine the face value cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst off, you get your private elevator. (No hanging out with those poor people in the stands /s) which takes you to the floor where all the suites are. You look at your ticket, and enter the right suite.\n\nThese suites are fancy - when you enter, there's a private bathroom to the side, and a room roughly around the size of a small bedroom. This room has all the free food and booze you can drink - open bar, sushi platters, tapas -- anything you can think of. On the other side of the room is the part that faces the arena. It's almost like a balcony. There are fancy leather seats and TVs at each seat so guests can get a close up of the action. There's also a server \n\nBtw, the actual location of the suites made being able to see the game impossible. \n\nI ended up in the suite a few times. The first time it was for a hockey game. I remember stepping out of my seat to grab a water (literally 10 feet behind me) and this older gentleman - the server - said \"That's OK miss, I can get it.\" I said it wasn't a problem but he insisted. His name was \"Jack\" and I was talking to him. He told me he'd been working there ten years and that he could see all the events for free. He was extremely friendly. I admit, I was so dazzled by being in a suite and the free stuff that I didn't notice how the other guests were interacting.\n\nThe other times, I noticed those guests were boorish and obnoxious. No one cared about the sporting event - they just wanted to get drunk and pig out on free food. I remember noticing people grabbing a plate of food, not touching it, and then throwing it out. A lot of people puked in the private restroom because it reeked. I also noticed that these people would refuse to get out of their seats for anything because the server was there (not Jack) even though the food and drinks were literally ten feet away. It was farther to get to the bathroom. It was a fun experience, but the people there were making it unconfortable. \n\nThe last time I went, Jack was the server. It had been about six months since the first time I went. I asked him where he had been and he said he'd been in a car accident and had been out of work all those months. He hadn't been able to walk for a while and this was his first week back. \n\nSeeing people boss him around to get their food and drinks made me livid. I know they didn't know about his accident, but the food and drinks were literally an arm's reach away. Also, it was apparent that Jack was still wobbly on his feet (he spilled a few things). It actually made me so unconfortable that I told my boyfriend I wanted to leave. Before I left, I said bye to Jack and wished that he felt better. Jack replied that  the accident had made him realize that he needed to retire and wished my boyfriend and I the best,\n\nThis happened about four years ago. My boyfriend quit that job shortly thereafter, so no more suite tickets. We have gone to the arena again for games, and prefer being with the crowd who actually want to see the event (!) than pigging out on free food and getting drunk. Even if we had the money, I wouldn't want to be a suite with entitled people.\n\nI never saw Jack again, but I hope he's enjoying his retirement and that people are serving HIM, on a beach, with unlimited food and drinks. \n\nTL; DR: We get upgraded to a suite with free food and drinks. Fellow patrons are too lazy to get their food themselves even though the food is less than 10 feet away. I return a few months later and people are bossing around the server returning after a serious car accident. He tells me that he's going to retire, and four years later, I hope he's living up his retirement.\n\nEdit: typo, clarity\n\nEdit 2: More clarity",

As a result, one of my \"unofficial duties\" is to stop at the grocery store to pick up half a gallon of milk every Monday, for the club.\n\nI leave the house ten minutes early on Mondays, but it never fails that I get to the supermarket and the only lane open is the express, with a weird little cashier who loves to chat.\n\nWell, this morning I get my milk and get in line. There is a lady in front of the cart that is in front of me, and nobody else in sight. She pays and starts to walk away. leaving the cart in line in front of me. Noticing the umbrella in the cart (and not wanting to be a b*tch by complaining about her abandoning the cart there) I said \"Hey! Your umbrella!\" and gesture toward the otherwise empty cart.\n\nJust then a woman who had not been anywhere in sight a moment before jumps ahead of me, says \"That's mine!\" and plops an armload of stuff on the belt.\n\nThe cashier is an older, Eastern European lady, who tends to be a little boisterous, and loves to joke with people, but she can be difficult to understand, her jokes are normally decades old, and honestly, while she means well, she is not the ideal choice as the ONLY checkout, especially when that checkout is an Express Lane.\n\nThe woman who has just appeared has eggs. The cashier mentions that the store discount card will save her $2 on them, and they walk off to the customer service desk to get the form to sign up.\n\nSo the line is stalled while she fills out the form to get a card to save on the eggs.\n\nShe asks the cashier to finalize the sale, without the eggs, saying she will just do a second transaction for them once she has finished the application form.\n\nThe total comes up and she complains that the \"ground chuck\" did not come up at the sale price. Because I can see the terminal from where I am, I point out that what she selected was ground TURKEY, and she starts paging through the flyer looking for the ad. Sure enough, there is a sale on ground turkey, but not the brand she picked up.\n\nShe says \"I didn't even NEED that. I just got it because of the sale\"\n\nThe cashier calls a manager to exchange the turkey for the brand that is on sale, and starts to remove them from the total.\n\nThe customer says \"Never mind. Just cancel the whole thing,\" grabs her umbrella, and walks out.\n\nShe held up the express lane for 16 minutes before getting angry that the cashier tried to help her save money, and then stormed out with nothing.\n\nETA: If she had taken about 15 seconds longer, I was prepared to pay for her $17 worth of food just to clear the line.\n",

        "text": "This happened yesterday and it just came to mind today after talking with a friend. Figured I would share it here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just moved and was having my first party at the new house. I ended up going to the local grocery store to pick up some food trays and on the way back home I decided to stop by a fast food joint to buy a breakfast sandwich and a hash brown. I placed my order &amp; paid. I thought how nice, clear, &amp; quick the cashier sounded throughout the transaction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I got to the second window to receive my food. The worker here told me the hash brown will take a moment to make and to please \"park in the first spot and we'll bring it out to you.\" I looked ahead and saw labelled parking spots that say \"Drive Thru Parking Only, # 1\" so I assumed I was to park here, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n20 minutes go by and other cars park around me but not in the drive thru parking spots, even though they came from the drive thru. I get up and go inside to ask for the status of the hash brown. I really wasn't in a hurry or in a sour mood. I really try hard to not be rude to workers who deal with the public as I've worked in retail for many years. The interaction goes a little like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: (I spoke to the cashier, not the person who gave me my food, she was at the window) Hi I was waiting on a hash brown? ( I had my receipt in hand).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cashier just looked back at the worker in the window and the worker came out to say the following\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorker: Oh. I went out there and didn't see your car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Alright, well I was waiting in the #1 Drive Thru designated parking spot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorker: Oh when I meant the first spot, I meant the spot directly in front of the drive thru.  (the \"first\" spot is two spots away from the drive thru parking)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Okay.. Well parking in the Drive Thru parking spots seemed like the most logical choice when you told me to park in the first spot..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point the worker kind of stared at me and then handed the hash brown over to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just left. I felt angry because I felt lied to. I watched the door the whole time and never saw any workers exit/enter the building while I was parked. I would have accepted \"I forgot\", or \"Here it is, it just finished\". I get that things happen.. But i felt blatantly lied to and just left angry. And when the worker spoke to me they had a really bad attitude, like it was my fault for parking in the spots that were labelled drive thru pickup. Why would they tell me to park anywhere but the drive thru parking? Maybe I am over thinking the entire interaction and I wasn't really paying attention and I did or said something wrong.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Mandatory STL, FTP, on mobile, not American, pardon my French, blah blah blah. \n\nI've always thought those social experiments with the same customer entering the same store two times, dressed differently and receiving equally different treatment every time were fake AF until I experienced something similar myself. \n\nI was driving home from the flea market where I had been helping my cousin disassemble her rather large vendor stand, and decided to stop by a clothing store that carries affordable wares and always has some kind of a deal going. This time it was on jeans, and seeing as mine were falling apart at the seams as I was wearing them, I decided to check it out. \n\nSo here I am, browsing jeans on the jeans shelves, and to my left a store clerk is helping a well dressed lady pick out hers as they're happily chatting away. I'm getting frustrated because every model in my size is cropped, I can't seem to find the full length jeans, and these two won't. Shut. UP. \n\nFinally, after about 15 minutes or so the lady moves to the dressing room, and I finally get the clerk's attention. \n\n\"Excuse me, which jeans models aren't cropped?\" \n\nI got a rather snappy \"I don't know, they're all cropped. Try XYZ.\" \n\nXYZ was cropped, too. Obviously. It's advertised around the store as such. \n\nNow, I may have been sweaty, dusty and sunburnt, but I wouldn't ask about the fucking jeans if I couldn't afford them. \n\nI bought the damn things elsewhere.

No problem at all; let’s get a new bag!\n     We saw a red tartan bag for £475 in the shop, and asked to buy it. When they checked her account, the credit note wasn’t there, so my wife said fine, charge my credit card, and refund it when the note is put on.

About six months ago, they hired a new employee named \"Dave.\"\n\n\"Dave\" is an immigrant, working hard to send money to his family. As the months have gone by, we have become very close with Dave. His wife added us on Facebook, we looked up some resources for him, and we'll chat and have a smoke before his shift starts. He also provides excellent service, such as making delicious sandwiches and always making sure our favorite things are in stock. If we want beer but it's cut off hours, he'll buy them for us on his account and we pay him back. \n\nAbout three months ago, Dave decided to get a bike and ride to work instead of taking the bus to save money. It's about a two hour commute one way, so it would eat up a lot of his time. My boyfriend bet Dave that he wouldn't last riding his bike to work for over a month. \n\nOne night that we went to the store, and Dave, always so friendly and talkative, was quiet and withdrawn. My boyfriend asked him what was wrong. Apparently while riding his bike on his way to work that night, drunken thugs had assaulted him. He told us they mocked him because of his ethnicity, and had hit him in the chest with a 2-by-4. The thugs weren't trying to rob him -- they just wanted to pick a fight. We told him he shouldn't ride his bike to work anymore. It was too dangerous. \n\nHe didn't stop. Whenever we'd walk to the store, his bike would be chained up on the bike rack. \n\nLast night, my boyfriend and I decided to stop by the store for sandwiches. Dave was supposed to be in. I pass the bike rack and see that his bike isn't there. Remembering what happened a few weeks ago, we run into the store. \n\nDave is fine. He's just tired from working a lot (extra shifts) so he took the bus in. My boyfriend declared that he won the bet, and gave him a $50 bus pass.\n\nI'm a very happy customer.\n",

And for some reason, you can’t pay using your saved bank information, which makes no sense. \n\nFinally, I call my phone company. I speak with a gentleman that states that his system is getting an error message as well, he reads it to me, and it’s the same message I get online. He says their system is down, he will put in a ticket, and to call back next week to try again. It’s almost like they don’t want me to pay it off....\n\nSo a week goes by, I semi forget about the issue and then remember randomly one day. I call and get a nice lady. I explain the issue, she attempts the payment 3 times, and gets the same error message.  (Suspect, in my mind). But she is determined, and suddenly, she gets it to go through! So I thank her for her time and determination. I’m glad I don’t have to drag my child to a physical store.  \n\nAs I am expressing my thanks, she just realizes she should have asked WHY I was paying off the phone before she took the payment. She asks me if I am upgrading my device and I say no.  I have been with this company almost 10 years and it’s the only company that gets good service in my area. She asks me if I’m planning on changing carriers. Before I can assure her I am not leaving the company, she states, “I’ve been here a long time, and I know how this game is played.” \n\nAt this point, I’m a little flabbergasted and annoyed. What is she insinuating? Am I playing a game? Clearly I am not a carrier jumper, I’ve been with them almost 10 years. Is it a game to want to have a lower cell phone bill? I would like an explanation for the statement, but was so appalled by its utterance that I just thanked her and ended the call. \n\nWhat the heck? ",

Was at the blue and yellow electronics store getting an XBone game for my nephews' Xmas gift. Yeah, I know its early but I like to get it out of the way.\n\nAs I'm checking out there's an older lady on the adjacent till attempting to return a Roku media box, 2 months after the return date. Eavesdropping, as I do, since I used to work retail oh, 25 years ago, the return was being attempted at a late date because the family was out of the country.\n\nGist was that some salesperson told the lady's son that the Roku could get some specialty international channels, and they found this wasn't the case. There was much pleading and gnashing of teeth, and the store manager had to get involved. I give him a knowing look and an eye roll.\n\nI swear this guy had the patience of a substitute teacher. Very calmly apologizing to the lady and explaining the 30day return, and although he would *like* to take the return, his system would not allow him to. The package was in good shape, everything was there and she had her receipt, but she was 60+ days past the threshold. Sometimes they can make exceptions if its within a few days, but no go on this one.\n\n\"Terrible customer service, never shopping here again, stupid policy, blabeddybla bla bla!\"\n\nI head out before her and wouldn't you know, she's parked close to me. Being as gregarious as I am, I strike up a convo and ask what the problem was. She didn't lie, or make herself out to be a victim, but re iterated what she told the staff. Then she asked me if I wanted to buy it off her for half of what she paid.\n\nNow this cheesed me off because I *just* bought the same damn thing for my inlaws 1 month ago. F**k you, universe. Roku Elite. FML.\n\nSo, being way back ex-retail, I said, \"Unfortunately, no, but you know I've tried to return stuff past the 30 days, and the staff can't do anything about it. Its a corporate policy handed down from their headquarters. They don't have the power to change anything about that, and they can potentially lose their jobs if they try.\" She was nodding in agreement, but obviously still a little upset that they couldn't take the item back.\n\n\"Hey, do you have any relatives in their teens or twenties?\" She said yes. \"Ok, well ask one of them to put it on Craigslist with a price you'd like to get for it, account for some haggling, and you could probably sell it in a week or so.\"\n\nShe said she'd try that, and admitted she understood that the staff couldn't break the rules. I guess it was different coming from someone with no investment in the situation. Maybe the next time she has a problem, she'll keep that in mind.\n",

        "text": "Bought a small tank and 2 fish this weekend for my kid (only spent about $20)... the kid helping us in the fish department was great and mentioned that if the fish dies within 30 days to bring it back for another fish or refund.  I thought 30 days was a long time but thought that was a good policy.  \n\nWell one fish (shrimp) died the next day. We put the fish in a ziplock bag with water and brought it back the first day we could (Wednesday- 3 days after purchase). I had the fish and the receipt, the fish (shrimp) was $3.99 and the person at the counter was like “we can't take this fish back because you need water from the bowl.”    \n\nI said the fish is in water. \n\nShe said that doesn't count cause the fish is dead and in that water. \n\nI asked if she really expected me to go home and come back to replace a $4 fish that I was told to bring back and was not told about the water.  This would take more time and gas than the fish was actually even worth.  Apparently their policy was worth more than me being able to return this fish.  \n\nI told the cashier I would not shop here again. After leaving the store, I called the customer service number cause I was wondering how much I spent at the store since I having their rewards card. They only had the last 2 years on file and I said but I only had one animal during the last 2 years-- but found out that I had still managed to spend over $1000 at this store.  \n\nApparently this store was willing to lose a customer over a $4. Wow.\n\nI originally left the fish and receipt at the store and then realized I wanted to post this info and went back to get it.  When I went back into the store, there were 4 employees just standing around the one register. I get that the folks working these stores do not care about the stores themselves but not one person said, yes let me replace your $4 fish...this is typically our policy but since no one told you and you found the time to bring the fish back.... but no one did...\n\nI’m not even sure I would have thought about bringing the dead fish back to the store if it wasn’t for the person helping us this weekend who actually mentioned it. And now I am over this store.\n\nLuckily there is a different pet store just up the block from this store.  ",

        "text": "/u/cmunk13's story (shared with permission):\n\nI have been training my new dog for service work for me. He’s still young, about 8 months, but he’s crazy well behaved, eager to please, and smart. Our dog trainer adores him. He’s also hypoallergenic, I’m allergic to dogs, and we recently shaved his hair super short. He’s super clean and a handsome boy. \n\n\nPart of his training is going out and about to stores. Sometimes we go into places with signs that say “no pets, only service animals” but we always ask beforehand. “He’s in training, blah blah, if he’s at all a nuisance we will leave, yada” Rarely has this been an issue,  as we only bring him into places where a dog isn’t a huge deal- no places with food, no fragile stuff.  The few times owners have cared, we just leave him in the car and shop in a few minutes or come back later without him. We are super careful, the purpose is for him to learn not to bother others.\n\n\nWell, we went to a fabric store today. This is AWESOME practice because the aisles are thin, so we work a ton on directional cues. We are practicing “let’s go” “sit” “this way” etc when we walk down a  kind of 4 way intersection of aisles. There’s a woman with a cart to our right, so we pause and wait for her to pass. She stares DAGGERS at me, and just like stands there. She’s blocking the direction we wanted to go, so we wait a little longer. Thinking she might be afraid of dogs, it happens, i back up and go around the aisle. Big whoop, took less than a few seconds.\n\n\nThen, we are waiting to get our fabric cut. We see her again so I tell my dog to sit on the other side of me, as far away as I can make him get and still purchase fabric, we are like 10-12 feet from her. I’m paying attention to my sewing pattern, trying to figure out how much yardage I need, when I hear her sigh loudly and go “God, just keep your dog away from me!”\n\n\nI’m now super embarrassed. It’s not my first rodeo with people pulling these stunts so i just steel up, act like I didn’t hear her. Nope, she wants to play c**tball.\n\n\n“You shouldn’t have a dog in here.”\n“Is no one going to make them leave?”\n\n\nLuckily the employees ignore her, and her friend who is getting fabric cut just changes the question. We get our number called right after her, so of course we are standing at the cut table next to her. I pull my dog to the farthest side and have him do a peekaboo lay, so he’s wrapped in between my legs taking up no additional floor space. She is still silently fuming.\n\n\nWe finished getting our fabric cut and go around the opposite long way from the other side of the store before going to the checkout, intentionally to avoid her. Nope. She pulls out right in front of us. The person I’m with just takes my card and buys the fabric for me so I don’t have to wait in line behind her. I hang out outside. \n\n\nShe comes out, sees my dog and scowls, then gets into a car parked in a  handicapped spot- without a handicapped license, placard, sticker, or any method of display saying she could park there.",

We'll send you a text to get you started. Our virtual assistant can have a representative call you if necessary.\" Then it hung up.\n\nWaited a few seconds, and sure enough, a text came through. I figured it would be a chat bot that I could text with, but it was just a link to their online chat bot. Which of course I couldn't access, on account of my data being broken.\n\nI figured maybe if I could reach them at an outside phone number, rather than the shortcut number that automatically calls them, I could talk to a person. So I texted someone and asked them to look up the number for me. Same result.\n\nI ended up having to wait until I got home and could access my wifi network to be able to use the damn chat bot, which then let me schedule a half-hour window for a callback from them. Still waiting.\n\nI'd really just like my phone to work.",

This is the kind of store where the parking lot has some John Deere lawn mowers parked in motorcycle parking if you get what I mean.

Some grunting and complaining while others sitting on their phones. An employee walks by the cashier as she yells for a break and the passerby stopped to relieve the employee but only for about two different customers ahead of me. \n\nHere comes the employee back with a George Foreman grill that was heavily basted in all kinds of rusty, caked on food. And... it’s now plugged in at the register. She begins to place bacon on the foreman as the customers watch in awe at the pure epitome of “I could care less” attitude. \n\nI was finally checked out as the employee used her greasy hands to hand me my receipt. I’m pretty sure I can unlock her iPhone with the finger prints left on the receipt. ",

        "text": "Edit: I am completely aware that companies have a policy against employees going after a thief. In no way would I expect anyone to risk their lives over material items. That was not the point nor expectation. Loss prevention was a thing at one point hence the inquiry. That is all. If your only response is of the aforementioned statements, please don't bother. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\nThis happend a few hours ago. I went out shopping for a few sweaters and was next in line at check out. Only two cashiers, both who seemed not quite right and took their good old time. Rather large line behind me. I'm just chillin', looking around when this lady just walked right out of the store with a pair of shoes. The first cashier told the second one what happend and to go stop her to which she replied \"I'm not going out there over a pair of shoes, you go.\" They argued back and forth until it was my turn.  I got the cashier who didn't want to run out, saying under her breath that she has customers take care of. I let her know that her decision is okay and understandable. People can be very unpredictable and the potential to get injured is not worth a pair of shoes. She seems to ease a little but eh.\n\nWhere the heck was loss prevention? Why would someone expect another to risk approaching someone like that if they themselves aren't willing? The first cashier who mentioned this was genuinely upset that the other wouldn't go out. I've been thinking about this incident and really hope that poor girl doesn't get in trouble over a pair of shoes. \n\nThey should make the automated doors work in such a way that as soon as the alarm goes off, the doors automatically lock, not allowing the thief to leave. Idk, probably not plausible or else it would have been implemented already?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/9h0vyj/the_story_of_the_hotel_that_was_not/",
        "text": "This one is super long, I do apologise. Tl;dr at bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friends I go to quite a few geeky conventions in the UK. After the first couple of times, we realised that staying at a hotel near the place where the convention was being held was a lot more comfortable than relying on public transport to get there/get back home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor this particular convention, my bestie had read up the reviews for the hotel where the convention was being held, and they were terrible. So she books us a room at a chain hotel that is directly in front of the one where the con is being held (sorry for the confusion, not using names is harder than I expected). It was cheaper, as she paid in advance, this will be important later. So we take the train, with our nice 1st class amenities and head off to a place I had always wanted to go, because my favourite character of all time is from that area. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur plan was to dump our luggage at the hotel, get our con badge, and then head off to do the touristy thing in the surrounding area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're using google maps to locate the address, but we're not having any luck. I'm carrying around a super heavy suitcase and the area is quite hilly, so my friend says I should wait while she checks it out. She circles the block where the hotel is supposed to be, but still can't find it. After about half an hour of this, she calls Customer Service. Friend will be F, Customer service will be CS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF: \"Yeah, we had a room booked for tonight at \\[Hotel\\] but we can't find it\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCS: \"Let me look up the details. Oh, I see the problem. That hotel no longer exists. We sold the building off to \\[Other Hotel Chain\\] two months ago.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF: \"....whut?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCS: \"You should have received an email about it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF: \"Well, I didn't receive anything.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCS: \"You probably set our email address as spam, and that's why you didn't see it. That is not our problem, so we can't do anything.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF: \"No, I definitely didn't set it to spam, as I had the updates linked to my calendar.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCS: \"Well, as we said, the hotel is gone, and we sent you an email, so there's nothing we can do.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF: \"You can't just leave us out on the streets after we paid for the hotel!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCS: \"Oh, the payment goes through between the date you booked the hotel and check-in, so no money has been taken from your account.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF: \"Well, I booked it 7 months ago and check-in would have been now, so that makes no sense. The money has to have gone out.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCS: \"No.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF: \"Well, I'm going to check my bank account, and see.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCS: *super condescending voice* \"You do that.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend was in tears, and she is not a weepy person, in fact, I'm more of a crybaby, but at that point I was enraged. So, we head to the hotel where all our friends are staying, and I have to say, the front desk person bent over backwards trying to help us after she heard our story. Some friends let us leave our luggage in the room, and there was talk of trying to fit us in somehow. Anyways, we head down to the bank to see what's up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the bank they tell us that the money has indeed left the account (literally two days after she booked it), but no refund has been issued. We're given a date and a time where the transaction had taken place and we head to another hotel that is part of the same brand as our missing hotel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere, the front desk people are lovely again. They kinda thought we wanted them to fix it, but what we really wanted was some info on what number we could call and what to say. They gave us a bunch of good advice and then let us use their lobby to sit and call CS again. And they gave us a cup of tea. And let us use a socket to plug in the phone so we could fix this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe repeat the whole spiel to CS again, and they are about as helpful as the first time. Among other things:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* They cannot issue us a refund, because it would have to be through the webpage of the hotel that is not, and since it no longer exists, they can't access it. But we can contest the charge on the card and they won't dispute it (*how kind /s*)\n* They can offer us a room at the same price in a hotel located 7 miles away in the middle of an industrial estate, or we can pay double for the hotel we are currently calling from\n* If we do stay at the hotel 7 miles away, they won't pay our transport to and from the city centre (even though lovely people at front desk said this was the law) because, and I quote \"don't you think it's unfair that the manager of that hotel has to pay for the errors of the manager of the hotel that closed down!!??\" Every time I said it wasn't a matter of fairness or not, it was the law, they just replied with \"No.\"\n\nThis went on for about two hours. Finally, at the end of my tether, I mention that I have a points card associated with the chain. She asks me for my name (the lost room had been booked under my bestie's name) and suddenly she goes very quiet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCS: \"Oh\" \\*long drawn out pause\\* \"I see you have been a member of our rewards program for quite some time.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Well, yes, we tend to stay at this chain for other conventions. Although you can see how after this we are considering not doing that again.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCS: \\*suddenly super chirpy and kind and polite, everything she hadn't been up till then\\* \"Well, you have enough points on your account for a free night, and we're gonna lend you enough points for another free night, so all you have to do is pay the last night, which is the cheapest at \\[half price of the original stay\\]! Would that be acceptable?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \\*tired af from travelling and then arguing for HOURS and taken aback at the sudden change in attitude\\* \"Uh, I guess so? Lemme ask my friend?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFriend was okay with it, and cried again, this time in relief. Hotel was booked, she bought me a swimsuit as a reward for 'fixing it' and although we never did get to visit that one place I was hoping to, at least we didn't have to head back home and miss the con.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe one thing I have learnt from this was what the bank guy told us: always pay with a credit card, instead of a debit. If this happens on a credit card, they will sort it out for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr Hotel chain sells the hotel we're meant to be staying at without warning us. All is just NO from CS until I mention I have a rewards program with them. Then everything is kittens and rainbows.",

The place sold these strange dessert samosas (kinda like a black bean paste loaded with sweet fruits and cooked with cinnamon) which had become a sorely needed comfort food. The father + son were having a huge row. No idea what about as they changed language upon seeing me (with a suprisingly efficient customer face in greeting) but it was notably feirce. The son was going around stocking shelves and the dad was actively up in his face as he was doing so. Both are yelling at the top of their lungs and I am left waiting at the till.\n\nThe son eventually spots that I am waiting, apologises and serves me. As he does so, the father pulls out a knife (no dont worry, its not going there) and grabs a hefty ball of fruit from the shelf. This fruit? A Durian.\n\nHe then proceeds to put the Durian on the desk, and cuts into it slowly as I am being rung up. All the while just staring into his sons eyes. The son os speeding up the encounter, and I thank my lucky stars that my nose was blocked to high heaven.\n\nIts a testament to the produce that I kept coming back, but I never saw the son in there again.\n\nEdit - for those not in the know, Durian is a horrificly smelly fruit that has legal restrictions in many countries due to said smell.",

        "text": "This is a bit of a reversal to the usual IDon'tWorkHereLady, where I was polite but mistook someone for an employee, and she got a bit irate. I just thought it was funny and wanted to share.\n\nA few Fridays ago I realized I had left my intended race outfit at home (45 minutes north of work), and had intended to drive down to a friend's house (45 minutes south of work) to run a half marathon the next day with her near her house. Due to proximity of things, it seemed easier to just spend the night at her place rather than drive all the way north to go all the way south again. Realizing I forgot my outfit, but had some backup shorts, a tank top, and shoes in my car, I figured I'd just go to the local large sporting store to buy a sports bra.\n\nI grab a few options and look over to see a woman putting several things back on racks in the section. She has 2 lanyards on, a slightly baggy t-shirt, and jeans. I didn't know the exact store uniform, but knew they all wore lanyards. It seemed totally plausible in my head that their uniforms would be some sort of athletic apparel plus the lanyard (turns out it's a green shirt.. who knew?). Between her actions and her lanyards/athletic top, I made the mistake of assuming she worked there. I walked up to her and politely asked if I could please have a fitting room.\n\nHoly cow you'd think I asked her to bow down to me and kiss my feet. She stared at me for a few seconds, raised her eyebrows and slow blinked to indicate to me that I was obviously an idiot, and then sarcastically said something along the lines of, \"I'm sure you can, but I wouldn't know how to do that because I don't work here\", to which she followed up by sticking her hand in my face and began walking away. I tried to apologize, laugh it off, and explained that her lanyards threw me off. She then replied, \"I don't fucking care what you thought. Stop talking to me.\"\n\nI was so taken aback. Like, I do understand that I mistook you for an employee, and I genuinely apologized for that. I've been asked in stores for dressing rooms or for help, and it's easy enough to just say \"I'm sorry but I don't work here\". Usually it's the customers who go off the rails, but it was just so odd to see someone freak out in the opposite context. ",

        "text": "About a decade ago, I'm stationed in Germany, and a married couple and I go to the base club to eat dinner, and they only have 2 other people eating there that night, so very not busy.  They primarily have grill items at this place, fairly standard American food. Being lovers of all things cheese, Husband and I both order quesadillas (I don't recall what Wife ordered), which come standard with cheese, chicken, bacon, peppers, onions, and sour cream. We relay to the very pleasant Waitress that Husband is very allergic to peppers and onions; he loves them, but will go into anaphylactic shock if he eats one, so please don't cook them in his quesadilla.  Waitress is extremely understanding, and writes down said instructions. I inform her that I would like to have mine made with no bacon; not a religious or dietary restriction, I simply am not fond of bacon (I know, how can I call myself American?)\n\nOur orders come out a short while later (sent out by Kitchen Runner), and as I separate my first slice, I notice bacon bits embedded in mine. I immediately inform Husband to not bite into his quesadilla (luckily, he'd started on the side of fries), and check inside, as the kitchen may have accidentally screwed up. Lo and behold, there are onions and peppers in his meal. We catch the attention of Waitress, and apprise her of the situation (completely stating that we believe it was a simple oversight on the kitchen'spart, and don't wish to assign blame). She is shocked, and immediately pulls out her order pad, and verifies on the carbon copy that she did in fact write down \"NO peppers, NO onions; allergy!\", for his quesadilla, and \"NO bacon\" for mine. I do not wish to cause any difficulties, so I decline her offer to have my quesadilla remade, as mine was a taste preference, not a necessity. Obviously, Husnand's quesadilla will have to be remade, and Waitress promptly whisks away the offending plate. \n\nAbout 90 seconds later, Kitchen Runner brings out a quesadilla for Husband, looking slightly more scared than her previous trip to our table. Husband is immediately suspicious of the rapid turn around, since he used to be a grill chef at a family owned restaurant before joining the service. He opens the quesadilla, and it is very obvious that the visible peppers and onions have simply been picked off. He flags Waitress over, and informs her that he cannot eat this quesadilla (she agrees that it is evident that it was not remade), as the juices from the peppers and onions are enough to induce anaphylaxis. \n\nWaitress is beyond indignant that Grill Chef was apparently not taking the safety of one of her customers seriously, picks up the plate, and storms into the kitchen. Not 20 seconds later, Grill Chef comes barreling out of the kitchen, Waitress hot on his heels, and Kitchen Runner looking worried just outside the kitchen door.  He places his fists on our table to lean over towards Husband, and YELLS, \"If you can't handle even the juices from something cooked on the grill, you need to order something else from NOT on the grill!  All items cooked on the grill touch each other!\"  Waitress, Kitchen Runner, Wife, Husband, and I collectively drop our jaws, and Grill Chef whirls back into the kitchen while we process what we just witnessed. \n\nHusband recovers first, after Grill Chef has vanished behind the kitchen door, and promptly states, \"That's what a f**king grill scraper is for!\"  Waitress looks at Husband, nods in agreement, and goes to fetch Manager (who acted as Hostess that night), only to see she is already walking towards us, with a quizzical expression on her face, as she'd heard the outburst, but not full details (grill restaurant is only part of the club, and the hostess station is outside the dining room doors in the club hall, where only about 6 of the 30 tables were visible, and we were seated out of her sight closer to the kitchen).\n\nManager quickly learns everything that went down, looks at the ticket, verifies that the order was placed properly, and confirm to us that Grill Chef CAN accommodate Husband's request, also bringing up the use of the grill scraper to remove contamination. Manager offers any entre item to Husband, of his choice, and that she will personally watch Grill Chef prepare it to ensure that it is made properly and not vengefully messed with. Husband immediately declined, stating that he would not eat anything prepared by Grill Chef that night, to which Manager replies, \"I don't blame you in the slightest.\"\n\nWaitress only ends up charging us for drinks, apologizing profusely, and we assure her she's not to blame, that her service was wonderful. On our way past the hostess station as we leave, Manager briefly stops us, and requests that we fill out a comment card, and, if possible, bring it directly to the Club Manager the next day (we gladly do).\n\nTL;DR: Trio orders dinner, sans certain items due to allergies, order is made with items; chef yells at trio for ordering food from his kitchen if they have a genuine allergy\n\nEdit to add:\n\nKitchen was not busy, as only one other table was present, and they'd already received their food. (Restaurant also was open for another hour and a half when we arrived). And Waitress did state after that it should have been no problem for the chef to clean the grill. My friend, even though he said \"That's what the scraper is for\", meant that the grill could be scrubbed enough fairly quickly, to cook his portion of the meal; what he said was just the first thing that popped into his head after the chef's tirade.

She quieted down after a while, so we went into the restaurant, but she was still in a terrible mood. \n\nWe were seated, and our waiter asked for our drink orders, but she was pouting and refusing to tell him what she wanted to drink. Our waiter told her he was going to count three and if she didn’t answer, she was getting lemonade. She didn’t answer, and he just left. She looked shocked, and we just laughed. \n\nWhen it came time to order our meals, he asked if she wanted broccoli or cookies as her side, and she quickly ordered cookies. \n\nHe turned her mood around very quickly, so he got a very large tip. Of course, if my parents had just ordered her lemonade she would have been way more upset. \n\nHe also introduced us to the table next to us, and got us to interact with them, which was fun. He did all the normal shenanigans, like bringing all the ketchup to the table and bringing a drink in a gallon sized mason jar. \n\n",

The lovely young man (well, he sounded young) confirmed everything and it all sounded perfect.  I gave my details and asked if I would receive confirmation of my booking.  He said I'd get an email.  Perfect.  I was even surprised when they didn't take any payment details to secure the room.  So nice.\n\nNearer the time I realise that I never got an email from them.  So I did the same search online to try and find the hotel again as I couldn't find my note of their phone number anywhere.... But to no avail.  I can't find any details anywhere.  I even try walking up and down the street on Googlemaps to see if I can find it that way.  But nothing.\n\nAfter 2 days of trying (including checking my internet search history) and finding nothing at all; I give up and decide I must have completely imagined the whole thing and maybe dreamed that I had booked the perfect hotel.\n\nI proceed to hunt for something similar and book (and pay) for something that, while not perfect, would do just fine.\n\nFast forward to the night of our family event and at 11pm I notice a missed call on my mobile from 9.30pm.  And there was a voicemail.  From XYZ hotel; \"just wondering what time you are going to book in?\"\n\nSo I wasn't going completely nuts then.\n\nI did phone them back the next morning and explain the whole situation and apologise for the 'no-show' but as I had simply no clue where the hotel was I wasn't about to try finding it in the dark at midnight in an area 3 hours from home that I didn't know at all with a disabled passenger and two grumpy, tired dogs on the off-chance that I didn't dream the whole booking.\n\nThey were very kind and understanding and also advised me that they didn't have an email address on file for me.\n\nI know this was partly my fault for not keeping a better record of the hotel name, number etc but the nice young man confirmed I would get an email (and even checked the spelling of my odd email address) so I relied on the details that this would send through to me.\n\n2 months later I did find my original hand written notes of the booking - slipped down the back of something.  I have kept these details for future reference as the hotel really does sound nice and the staff that I spoke with were so lovely.\n\nAnd I have learned - don't rely on emails, phone calls or any other out-of-my-control promises to keep my records.",

        "text": "Posted this originally to TalesFromRetail... but it really should have been here. My apologies for that. Also on the Long side, so please bear with me\n\nThis was a few years ago, and remains one of the more bizarre experiences in my life.\n\nWe live near a mall, which has a large supermarket type retail outlet. I had gone with my sister to pick up a bunch of stuff that we needed, and at the store I had split up with her, because she had gone to pick up some things such as towels which were in a very different section from where I was. I had gone to pick up some shampoo, soap, etc because there were always offers on buying these items in combos or something.\n\nI was wearing a simple blue shirt and trousers, cause I'm fairly fashion unconscious, but I like blue I guess. The employees of the store had a similar shirt, but a different shade, with the name of the store on the chest pocket, and lanyards. But I figure it might explain the beginning of what happened next. I just felt someone yank me painfully by the shoulder, almost causing me to spill my basket, and before I could figure out what the hell was happening, I'm face to face with a large, middle-aged woman, who was obviously wealthy given by her clothes and jewelry. She was angrily asking me why I wasn't responding to her, and anyway, I needed to carry her massively overloaded basket of goods (this was BTW a store that offered wheeled trolleys, so god knows why she didn't get one of those) which she thrust hard at my chest, pushing me back a little.\n\nNow maybe she got confused, because I had picked up a certain brand of shampoo, then on calling my sister realized it was the wrong one, and the store didn't have the brand sis wanted. Instead of just leaving it somewhere for someone else to put away, I figured I'd return it to where I had gotten it. That's what I was doing she saw me, so that, coupled with my clothes, might have maybe led her to believe I was an employee.\n\nI politely tried to tell her that I had no clue where the items she wanted were, because I wasn't an employee. For some reason, that just pissed her off. Next thing I know, she's screaming her head off at me, saying she'd report me, call the cops for my lack of respect, that I was harassing her. Over the years, I've relived that moment a bunch of times, always mentally doing something badass, but 19 year old me just stood there and gaped at her. Some poor store employee, clearly recognizing what was up, came up to her, and had to then offer to deal with her. She just turned on him, grumbling and shouting at him while he went about, carrying her stuff, getting her what was needed, and taking her to checkout. I'm watching this dumbfounded, since she only needed like two more things! She keeps angrily ranting at the manager of the store as her stuff is checked out, pointing at me, eventually leading to the Manager giving her some sort of discount at which point she got her stuff and left.\n\nI'm just telling this story, because it really brought home to me how much we mistreat people in the service industry. I still regret not having done much that day. Best I could get myself to do that day was go up afterwards to the manager, apologize, and leave my contact details so that if she complained, they'd at-least know who I was. Reading the stories here, I wanted to share this experience. Its both an apology from me for the times I've been rude or impatient myself, but also hopefully a message of solidarity from an appreciative consumer.\n\ntl;dr: My personal crazy consumer story, and my best wishes to everyone who has to deal with this crap regularly.",

It’s A long one...\n\nAbout a month ago I was shopping in a fashion store in our mall looking for a dress. I found a dress on a rack mixed in with a few different styles and also different colors of the same dress. The rack held about 4-5 different styles of dresses in different colors of each style...maybe 30-40 dresses total. At the end of rack was a sign that said 50% off. Found a dress tha fit perfect, went to checkout.  The cashier gives me the total and as you can probably guess, it doesn’t ring up at the 50% off (it did ring up at a lower price than the sticker, however).  I explain the sign and she radios someone on the floor to check as I walk out to show the person where I found it. \n\nI see a women and hear her radio back that the sign says “select styles” (I will be honest, I completely missed that part, it was super small at the bottom of the sign).  I greet her and show her where the dress was located and the fact that there are numerous of this same style dress on the rack in different colors. I truly believe anyone would have thought the dress was 50% off based on the rack size and the sign. She points to the sign and walks away. I folllow her and ask how I’m supposed to know what dresses are the 50% off and what the sale price is on the others since they are clearly different percentages off based on the price mine rang up as. It would have made more sense if the sign said “Up to 50%” off. She says they placement is dictated by marketing and it’s out of her hands. I ask to speak with a manager and low and behold it’s her. I’m getting frustrated at this point and ask if she can understand how this can be confusing/misleading to a customer since it’s not clear what’s on sale, what’s not and if it’s not the 50% off, what is the discount (remember my dress did rung up cheaper than the tag). She refuses to look at me and again says it’s out of her hands. \n\nWe were getting no one and she clearly did not want to help make the situation any better. I asked for the district managers name and was told she’s not allowed to give that information out but did give me a number to the corporate office. I want to note that at no time did I ever get loud with her. I was definitely frustrated but kept my tone in check. I just couldn’t believe that she would not hold a conversation with me at all. Just turned her back and gave short “it’s not my fault” responses.\n\nI called the corporate office and spoke to a wonderful woman who actually listened to my frustrations. I ended the conversation feeling like even thought the store manager was horrible, the corporate office truly cared enough to speak to me about it. They said they would speak to the district manager and he would in turn speak to the store manger. My end goal was in hopes that 1.the would make their signage more clear and 2. The store manager would take the time to listen to a customers compalint and try to find a solution that would make everyone happy....she could have showed me the dresses that were actually the 50% for example if she couldn’t fully discount the one I wanted. \n\nFast forward to today when I went back to the store for the first time since the incident. My son found a sweater he wanted and we headed to checkout.  The girl who helped us was very friendly during the entire transaction. At the end I had some rewards that needed to be applied. She was new so she called the manager up. I guess I figured she would either remember me and say nothing or I was just another face in the crowd. I was wrong...she applied my rewards and than looked and me and said “your the customer who was upset about the dress” and walked away.  It was awkward for all of us standing there. I told the cashier that there was an issue the last time I was in. The cashier apologized and said “she’s not very nice sometimes” \n\nI really wanted to say something to her when I left the store about how unprofessional I felt she was but I remembered how I got no where with her the last time and my teenage son would have died of embarrassment. I’ve already decided that I’m done shopping at the store. The anxiety of what she might say to the the next isn’t worth it to me. Is it even worth calling corporate again or do I just move on with my day?\n\n",

I went in and they didnt have any of that item on the shelf so I thought maybe they didnt put it back it cause it was less than an hour ago. So I went up to the front to ask. There were two people up at the register, I ask one and told her that i had call earlier about this item asking if they still had it or if it was still up here. She knew what I was talking about and started looking for it, when she couldn't find it she asked the other girl that was up there if she knew where it was.

She asked if I was sure I said yes and quietly told her that the employees shouldn't be so rude and quietly left, then I called their corporate number. So I was curious is anything going to happen?

        "text": "Posting on mobile so apologies for formatting/ grammar issues. TL:DR at bottom\n\nThis was actually from a couple of months ago, but I was talking to a friend today and it made me think of it. \n\nMy coworkers and I planned on going out for a couple drinks and dinner on my birthday, which was on a Friday this year. It ended up being around 10 of us that had plans to go. Since we were going on a Friday around dinner time I asked my one friend to call and see if we could get a reservation (about a week in advance).\n\nSo myself and one other coworker headed over after work. They had our table ready for us when we got there. We went ahead and sat down and ordered drinks. We were still waiting on everyone else that works at different locations. I still wasn’t 100% sure who all was coming since I hadn’t heard back from a few people. \n\nAfter a few minutes I excused myself to the restroom to wash my hands. When I came back my coworker said the waitress asked how many we would have in our party. Again, I wasn’t 100% sure, but I thought a couple people may have backed out, and I wasn’t entirely in charge of the planning. The reason the waitress had asked is because there were two guys that needed a table and she was wondering if they could sit with us (since we had a 10 top), and the place were pretty packed. \n\nI try to be a nice human being (sometimes lol), so since I thought a couple of people wouldn’t show I told the waitress that the two guys were welcome to sit at our table if they wanted. She thanks me and says they will have a party of 5. I was thinking “umm excuse me! That’s half our table!” Even if a few people backed out, I knew there were 6 that were definitely coming. So that takes away at least one persons spot, if not more. \n\nI politely informed her that unfortunately we would not have that many open seats available. I felt a little bad because the other party had to wait a little while for a table. I am glad I didn’t let anyone sit with us though because everyone did show up. \n\nBy the way, the waitress was great, so I had no problem with the actual service at all. I will gladly return there. I also don’t know if it was the waitress or the other guys that originally asked if they could sit at our table (they may have asked her to check with us). \n\nTL:DR - made a reservation for 10 for my birthday, while waiting for the rest of our party to show up, waitress asked if a separate party of 5 could take up half of our reserved table\n\n\n\nEdit: so I see there are some comments from people that are baffled that they let us sit at all without the whole party there. I used to work in a restaurant for years as a server, so please don’t think I’m just some asshole customer. I know how restaurants and reservations work. I was a little surprised myself that they let the two of us go ahead and sit as soon as we walked in. Myself and all of my coworkers work at a bank, at different branches, so yes it was a little difficult for all of us to get there at the same time. Unfortunately working at a bank on a Friday, we can’t necessarily get out exactly when we close due to multiple last minute customers. I also was not the one to make the reservation, otherwise I would have made it for a later time when I knew that everyone could get there about the same time. I did let the hostess know as soon as we got there that I wasn’t completely sure exactly how many people were coming (or when) and it may not be all 10 that was originally expected. Believe me, I was embarrassed walking in not being able to give them an exact number and knowing we may be holding spots for people that weren’t coming. Our waitress was tipped well because she was fantastic, and we even made sure to give the waitstaff and kitchen two big helpings of cake to share. ",

        "text": " Originally posted on r/IDontWorkHereLady but was forwarded to here. So here goes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a short person and often feel extremely frustrated at not being able to reach things from the top shelf. I really don't like bothering the staff to get things down and there usually isn't any other alternative other than waiting to be asked if I need help or just not getting the item or getting a similar item lower down. Often when this happens I get quite frustrated and angry at the useless situation but just walk out without an incident.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis day I needed printer ink. The staff at the store I buy it from do not have a uniform. They just wear a coloured lanyard that identifies them as staff. The store is often busy with few staff whose main goal is to try to sell you on the most expensive electronics within your budget so printer ink was not high on their priority list. The store also connects two parts of the mall and often there is a lot of foot traffic from people who aren't customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe exact printer ink I needed was hanging at the very top of the shelf and I knew there was no chance of reaching it without some kind of help. I was directly in the path of foot traffic so I took a step out of the way so I wouldn't be in the way of other customers and took a few moments to weigh up my options while I stared longingly at the printer ink I wanted. As I thought about how to approach my problem I felt a presence at my side. I shifted slightly thinking they might want to walk past or look at something and I didn't want to get in someones way. When they still didn't move I notice they were staring right at me. I figured it was probably a staff member and I tried to look for the lanyard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I realised he wasn't staff and very tall, I had two competing thoughts. The first was, \"Ah ha! He could get it for me.\" and the second was a flashback to IDWHL. This was the perfect situation where an IDWHL could take place and I didn't want to be one of *those* customers. As he hadn't walked past and wasn't looking at items it seemed to me like he was waiting for me to realise he could be of assistance. I had to take another few moments to decide if I would actually ask someone who wasn't staff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstead of being one of *those* customers I approached the topic in a civil manner. I politely explained I'm just too short to reach the printer ink I needed. He reached up, grabbed the printer ink and gave it to me. I thanked him and he quickly walked off to do whatever it was he was planning to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt really goes to show that when you approach the situation the right way, even if they're not staff, you can still get the assistance you need.",

He's a horrible person, but still.\n\nLast night, I stopped off at the supermarket after work to pick up some provisions. It took the butcher a little over 15 minutes to come out from behind the back, which is annoying, but I don't really care that much specifically, I only bring it up to show another level of how poorly the store was being managed.\n\nI finally make it to checkout, and the guy in front of me has complicated things he wants to do with his order, all of which require managerial approval. Manager finally gets over there, but instead of just punching in his code, he starts flirting with the significantly younger cashier. The one line I really remember was the title, \"She wants me to come over because I smell so good.\" Honestly, I'm not sure which was more offensive, what appears to be the script from a \"What Not To Do\" video from HR, or that he's doing it instead of getting the line moving again.\n\nSo I tell him this isn't cool, and I'd like the number for corporate. To which he goes and runs in the back and disappears. The problem with that strategy, it's really easy for me to look up the answer on my phone. I just got a call from the regional manager, they don't appear to be happy with the guy. \n\nHonestly, I'm feeling a little guilty, messing with someone's livelihood. That said, he's a terrible, terrible manager. \n\nTL;DR: Manager would rather hit on his employees than manage the store. Corporate just got back to me, they don't sound happy. ",

        "text": "** Setting the scene: **\n\n\nWe were in [v. small Northern CA town] on our honeymoon, and we walked into this restaurant after having spent a day at the beach. We had bought art from a local vendor at the farmer's market that morning, and the artist told us more of her art was on display in this restaurant, so we came by the restaurant to take a peek. I went inside, (saw a bunch of open tables in the back as I was looking around,) then figured we'd treat ourselves to this $30/plate-on-average restaurant and eat here since it was our honeymoon, even though we were a little under- dressed, (a bit frumpy, but nothing revealing or anything with holes - it's a beach town, and we'd just been at the beach,) but we figured, it's Northern California, we'd be fine. Most of the other guests were dressed in CA golfing clothes, and other residents of the town that we had chatted to mentioned that tourism was down and they were hurting for business. \n\n\n**The story : **\n\n\nWe asked the red-haired host how long it would be to get seated on the patio for the ocean view, and he said he thought 15 minutes, but he'd check with someone. We sat and waited. \n\nHe came back and said it would actually be a while. We asked how long, and he said, \"A really long time.\" I said, \"Ok, we can sit inside instead,\" and he gave us a weird look, and said \"That's also a really long wait.\" I asked how long, and he said \"A reeaally long time, much too long for you, probably. I said, \"We can sit in the back, that's fine,\" having seen the many open tables in the back where a few people were sitting, and he said there was no room, so I said I thought I'd seen a bunch of tables back there, and he said he had to fit a table of 8 back there (even though there were many other tables...) \n\n\nWe were getting a really weird vibe off the guy as if he really didn't want us there, so we pushed a little just to be sure we weren't crazy. \"So is there a way we could eat here?\" I asked.  \"You could open a tab at the bar,\" he said. (We realized he may have thought we were going to dine and dash?) No apology, no smile, no normal display of regret or anything. And we definitely weren't being rude! At that point, we politely declined, and left. \n\n\nWhen we exited, we checked in with each other, and both of us had separately gotten the same vibe of not being wanted there. We have never been treated like this anywhere before, so we were both kind of stunned and a bit offended. It felt very surreal. (And we've definitely dealt with being turned away politely from restaurants with no room before, so it's not like we're just offended that we didn't get a spot.) \n\n\nWe managed to laugh it off and have a good evening elsewhere, but geez, we weren't *that* shabbily dressed. A weird honeymoon experience for sure.  (We left a less than flattering review.)\n\n\n** The takeaway : **\n\n\nWith the risk of sounding like one of those \"see? I'm being discriminated against TOO\" people, the event definitely left us with much more personal look into what minorities have to deal with on a much more regular basis, and showed us what it feels like to be judged by one's appearance.  We hadn't had that happen to us before, and probably won't much in our lives.  My husband said, \"Wow, as a straight white man, I've never had that experience before.\" It gave us a hard look at our normal privilege that we take for granted. \n\n\nTLDR : Douchy ginger rejects honeymooners from middle-class fancy-ish restaurant because they look a bit frumpy. White honeymooners learn a lesson about privilege. \n",

        "text": "I was out with one of my buddies one night and we were starving. Not many restaurants open, except one cafe/diner type place we'd been to before. We'd been there before a time or two. It wasn't great before, but I'm also not really a picky eater.  \n  \nNo line, not many customers, but we wait for a few minutes before a hostess saw us and decided to seat us. Okay, whatever. We get seated and it takes a few minutes before the waitress takes our drink order. At this point I'm thinking maybe this wasn't a great idea, since we had poor service here in the past, and the poor service we're already getting isn't making me really change my mind. Whatever, a few minutes here and there isn't the end of the world. Plus, I don't know what servers and whatnot are doing....maybe they're extra busy for some reason in the back, even though everything I could see made it seem like they weren't too busy and had plenty of waitresses/servers/etc.  \n  \nMy friend and I are both ready to order when we get our drinks, but we get a \"hold on a minute I'll be right back\" when we say we're ready to order. Been here for 20 minutes so far, about 15 minutes longer than it should take, without even getting my order placed. Finally, she returns and we put in our order. Don't remember what my friend got, but I ordered a New York steak sandwich. It caught my eye on the menu because it said it has blue cheese on it. Sweet, I think I'm really going to like this and maybe I'll start coming here often....I can deal with the slow service if I'm getting a sandwich I really like.  \n  \nNow it's been 45 minutes I've been at this place, probably closer to an hour. So far I haven't gotten a single refill (here in USA, as you probably all know, you're basically getting your drink refilled constantly). Finally the food arrives! I take a bite or two out of the sandwich and....hmmm.....there's something wrong. It seems fine, I think, it just doesn't taste that good. Maybe I've been hyping it up in my head for OVER AN HOUR NOW...? Huh, okay that's really disappointing....oh wait yeah -- it has no blue cheese on it. Of course! Again, I'm not really a picky eater, but this no blue cheese thing really makes or breaks the sandwich.  \n  \nI'm expecting the waitress to come by any second now, because they usually come by after they give you your food and ask if there's anything else you need or if there are any problems. Waiting, waiting, waiting...nope, no waitress. Okay, I'll just wait for a different waitress, server, busser, or whatever else to come by and I'll ask them to send my waitress over here. As I look around, I realize there's no one really working here, everyone's in the back doing who knows what. I see the hostess at the front and decide to ask her to send my waitress over since my food isn't right...well, may as well look at the menu and *make sure* the menu had blue cheese listed as part of the sandwich, or if I had just imagined it. Sure enough, it's on the menu. Whew, okay, at least I'm not crazy.  \n  \nFinally the waitress comes by and asks what's up. I tell her there's no blue cheese on my sandwich. She looks at me as if I had told her the sky is blue or ice is cold. She asks what's wrong with that and I told her the menu has blue cheese listed as being on the sandwich (and I know there's no way I ordered it without blue cheese because that's exactly why I ordered it). To this, I get the genius response, \"Well, most people don't like blue cheese. So unless you request it with blue cheese, we serve it without it.\" She still tried to finagle her way out of sending it back and getting blue cheese put on it, as if she was just going to tell me why there was no blue cheese on it and that was that.  \n  \nI get it, some people don't like blue cheese (those people are heathens by the way). But, wouldn't it make *a tiny bit of sense* to, you know, instead of just NOT putting blue cheese on a sandwich unless specifically requested, to just be like, \"By the way, that sandwich comes with blue cheese, is that okay?\" This happened kind of a while ago, but I'm still kinda floored that this occurred. I ended up getting it resent and got blue cheese on it, but damn. I just....I can't even...",

A few years after school one of my closest friends had a birthday party, canapes and drinks at this lovely venue, where many of the girls I knew from school attended. It was a pretty big deal for me to see all these friends, some of which I hadn't seen in years, and we were all dressed up and having a great night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have social anxiety, so basically in situations like this I can't eat. The thought of food makes me nauseous and so I generally find polite ways to avoid it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe servers were coming around constantly with plates full of delicious looking food, which I politely declined.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"No thank you\", \"Oh, I'm not hungry, but that looks great!\", and \"Oh sorry, I had a huge lunch!\" can only be thrown around so many times. After a while, the servers were looking at me with increased confusion as I continued to decline, and was evidently the only person not eating the amazing food that they were offering. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext thing I know, I'm sitting chatting with a friend and a young waiter, beaming with pride, comes up to me with a small platter of food. He kindly informs me that he had the chef make a vegan platter just for me as they had noticed I wasn't eating the other food. I didn't have the heart to tell him that I wasn't vegan, and graciously accepted the platter (which I actually managed to eat some of, and yes, it was amazing). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt made a funny story to tell, but honestly the kindness of the servers and chef, going out of their way to try and accommodate me and make me feel comfortable and welcome was amazing!

        "text": "This happened minutes ago and I’m both frustrated and befuddled as to what the hell happened. \n\nHusband and I recently moved and ordered a futon. We took the long route, choosing to buy from a lesser known business, and so we knew it would take about three weeks to come in. We have no bed in the meantime and so have been checking the tracking number every day or two. Luckily the delivery service with all the purple is usually on top of updating those things. \n\nHowever we received a notification that our package arrived and yet...no package. Part two arrived the next day and we were notified accordingly. But still no part one of our package. \n\nSo I called the purple delivery people and I have been on hold for an hour while various people pop on and off the phone to tell me that it was delivered two days ago. I insist I don’t have it. They insist I do. It was DEFINITELY delivered Monday according to their system. Finally I ask to speak to a manager. After another ten minutes a dead pan voice come on and I do my stern talking routine. Silence on the other end. Some typing. “Ma’am, it arrived at 6:53pm today.” I look at my phone to see it says 6:56pm. No fucking way. I open the door, swearing, to find my package! \n\nI end the call with “your tracking system is shit, thanks for wasting my time.” I’m kinda an asshole, but I’ve been arguing for over an hour about whether my package has been delivered or not so I think I earned it. I’m still unsure how this whole mess happened. ",

        "text": "A little bit of backstory\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of my favorite foods is pretzels, so naturally when I'm out I wouldn't mind to get a pretzel or look for a pretzel place. There was one that just opened at the mall so I tried it. I liked everything about the place so much that it ended up being my go-to place when I was out and hungry, I went there around once a week. I started going there so much that I started to get recognized by the employees. They were all nice and the pretzels were delicious so I was always happy to go there.\n\nJump forward to a year later. It was raining out so I had my hoodie on when I got in, so it was kind of hard to see my face. I walked in and saw a woman working who I remember from the last time I went. She was loudly yelling at an employee for not putting something in an container right in front of he customers, so I subconsciously remembered her when I saw her again. I asked for a pretzel with extra salt (because they barely put salt on them) and she just gave me a weird look. I was very confused and thought, \"Is it that weird to ask for a pretzel with extra salt?\"\n\nShe looked at me and said, \"You know that you are not allowed in here anymore.\"\n\nI immediately gave a confused look and said, \"what?\"\n\nShe then said, \"Tell your parents that their not allowed in here either.\"\n\nThen I said, \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nShe stopped giving me that look and said, \"Wait, are you not the guy?\"\n\nThen I said, \"nope.\"\n\nShe started to immediately apologizing and said that there was an incident that last week that resulted them not being able to sell pretzels with extra salt anymore. I then asked what had happened last week and she said that she couldn't tell me. I got my pretzel, left and thought that that was really weird. I shared the story to a lot of my friends and they thought that it was weird too.\n\nA couple of months later, I went there and saw a different worker over the counter. I asked if they still sell pretzels with extra salt, he said that they absolutely do. I told him the story that had happened a couple of months ago, and he was very confused. He had no idea why she said that, and that \"Its just a pretzel extra salt.\" He asked what she looked like and I told him what I could remember of the girl. He said, \"Ya, I kind of remember her now, she only worked for a little bit though... Lets just say that she had some problems.\" I still don't know what happened on that eventful day, or will ever know. All I know is that it involved a guy, his parents, and an extra salted pretzel. Most certainly one of the weirdest stories has ever happened to me.",

I mean doesn't matter if it is *on* the fries or *next to* it, right? Well, I was wrong. The guy that served us prepared our plates and then poured the ketchup on top of the *salad*...

It was short staffed, and we essentially had 1 day off a week, plus half of Sunday (They were religious). This is relevant because these kids could sometimes be little trolls, and one day off was all I really had to relax and unwind.\n\nSo, myself and another co worker have off for the day, and He and I end up going to the magic store, and then afterward, to slide by a typical fast food chain to grab some food. So we walk in, and I walk up first to order. Me will be myself, W will be worker.\n\nMe: Hi can I get a number 6 meal?\nW: Sure\nMe:Thanks\n\nCue expectant pause, before the employee asks\n\nW:You thirsty?\n\nNow, I simply thought that he was going to offer me a size upgrade to a drink or something, you know, some trained kind of thing they have to do for the company.\n\nMe: Yeah, I guess (chuckle lightly)\nW: Well then you gonna pick something to drink?\n\nHe said it with such an attitude as well, like, I had inconvenienced his whole day because it skipped my mind to say my drink. I order a drink, and my friend orders after me, and he gets an equal level of sass. My friend tells me afterward that he thought he was rude too, and mind you, my coworker is like the most polite, mellowed minded and chill dude I worked with. You could've killed the dude's mom and he still would've been like \"Hey, that's ok.\" (Hyperbole but you get the idea.)\n\nNow I find it funny but at the time...? Am I making too big a deal of this?

        "text": "Sorry if this gets a little long.  It’s my first post.  Also, if this doesn’t belong here, please let me know.\n\nThis happened about 6 months ago.  I had a good friend get killed in a car accident.  I’d known him my whole life, so I was devastated.\n\nAbout a week and a half after the accident, I went out to lunch with a friend at a place we’ve gone to dozens of times.  We ended up having a girl I know as our server.  Lunch was great.  Had some good food and got to get out of the house and get my mind off of everything for a little bit.\n\nWe asked for boxes, and then asked for our checks.  She was taking a bit of time coming back to us, which was no big deal because I figured she was just busy.\n\nWhen she finally came back, she didn’t have any books in her hand.  All she had was a slip of receipt paper that she had written on.  She knew about what had happened and knew I was having a rough time.  So she told us that our lunch was on her because she knew it was hitting me hard and just wanted to put a smile on my face.  I was so appreciative, I stood up and hugged her with tears falling from my eyes.\n\nSo my friend and I gather up our stuff to leave.  We get down the road and realize in the midst of being so emotional, we forgot to tip her.  Neither of us knew what to do since she only had a credit card and I only had big bills, but we knew we couldn’t not tip her after what she did.  So we ended up stopping at a store where they were selling Girl Scout cookies out front so I could break my big bill.\n\nI went back to the restaurant and asked for our server, told her we forgot to tip her because of everything, and handed her a decent tip.  She told me I didn’t even need to do that, but I told her that her kindness meant a lot to me right now, gave her a hug, and went on my way.\n\nIt goes to show you that just a simple act of kindness when someone is going through something can really make a difference.",

After talking to customer service, I was given a refund and a discount on the new plan.\n\nLong form:\n\nsFrint has done this before and settled with FCC for $68 million in 2015. Most large cellular providers in the US do this or similar frauds, since expected profits are larger than settlement costs.

Here are a few examples:\n\nThe plan changed, and you were informed of it -&gt; Said it was unauthorized\n\nStart to show the increased charge language in the last historical charge -&gt; Said you don't want to see it in the bill but in the original purchase agreement\n\nThe promotional plan expired -&gt; Said you didn't buy a promotional plan\n\nBlames it on the retailer (such as Fartgate) -&gt; Insisted that it's a sFrint issue not retailer issue\n\nAnswers get vague and repetitive at any point -&gt; Ask for supervisor escalation\n\nspecialist offers to look for other plans -&gt; Asked for steps to cancel line\n\nSpecialist claims line can only be cancelled by another department -&gt; Asked to be connected, never hang up and call another number\n\nSpecialist says they're not available online/that department has closed for the day/blah blah -&gt; Said you don't want to wait for hours in the call queue\n\nSpecialist offers a fixed amount refund -&gt; Claimed the actual cumulative difference was larger\n\nTries to sell a new plan -&gt; Asked for itemized bill and fine print, it's probably an inferior plan (hotspot excluded, etc).

        "text": "Hey all! First time poster, and on mobile so sorry for any formatting issues and sorry for the length. \n\nThis story is actually from a couple of years ago but thought it would be nice to share here. So I was looking to buy a new car, and this would be my first time getting a BRAND new car, previous vehicles were all used. \n\nI ended up only looking at the Hyundai dealership since my parents both dealt with the same dealership about 30 minutes from us and they knew the guys there would take care of me. I went one day on the weekend and looked at and test drove a couple of cars. I didn’t have a very big budget, maybe $18,000, so nothing too fancy. I really wanted a blue car, but the one car I looked at that i could afford was only available in red at their dealership, but they offered to check another location for me. They did have a brand new 2017 Elantra available (this was in 2016) that I loved and it was in a pretty blue that I liked, but sticker price was a little out of my price range. The salesman, who we will call J, offered to let me test drive it and said we could work something out if I liked it. I ended up falling in love! After talking to J about the price, they agreed that they would do a trade in on my current car for $800 and also give me a couple thousand off sticker price since my parents were good customers. I wanted to think on it and make sure it worked with my budget, since it was still a couple thousand over what I had originally planned. \n\nI decided that night that was the car I wanted. It had everything I was looking for! So the next day I called J to let him know. He told me they would get it ready and I could come by anytime. I was so excited, but I was scheduled to work all day. I checked with my supervisor and he agreed to let me leave work to get the car, even though I worked about an hour from the dealership and he knew I would be gone for a long time. \n\nI called my mom and asked if she could come with me, since this was all very new to me. She agreed and met me there. She had called my dad who works close by to let him know I was getting the car and he was going to meet us there. Let me just say here that my dad works at a bank as a loan service manager, and he is VERY financially responsible and is usually the one we ask for financial advice. This is important later. \n\nWe get to the dealership and talk with J and the sales manager, D. J takes my mom and I to get started on paperwork. My dad still hadn’t made it, but I wasn’t worried because this is something I wanted to do on my own. I also work for a bank as a teller so I’m not completely clueless when it comes to financial stuff. \n\nAs soon as I signed everything and was handed my keys my dad calls my mom to say he is on the way. She stayed inside to talk to him while J and I went out to the car. She comes out a few minutes later and she is pissed. Apparently my dad was angry that I didn’t wait for him to look everything over before signing. He showed up a few minutes later like a bull in a China shop. He starts fussing about how I should have waited and he could have made sure I was getting the best deal. He is not being quiet about it at all and we are right in the middle of the dealership with other customers. Well this upset me really bad to the point that I started crying since I have really bad anxiety issues. \n\nD, the sales manager, ends up pulling me aside and gives me a hug and trying to calm me down. Meanwhile my mom is telling my dad exactly what she thinks of him ruining this for me when I was so excited. Eventually I calm down but now I’m just pissed at him for how he acted. I understand his point of view but feel he could have handled it better. \n\nI will be forever grateful to D for taking the time to calm me down and show me that kindness. I have been there multiple times since then because we also have our cars serviced there. I also stop by and chat with J and D, and we always take them homemade treats around the holidays. The guys at this dealership have always shown us the best customer service and over the last couple of years they have become like family and I will purchase any future cars from them.  ",

        "text": "On the weekend my friends and I went to a popular chain pub/restaurant. We'd made reservations so we weren't a bunch of assholes who showed up on the busiest night of the week without giving the place some notice. We were on time as well.\n\n\nI used to work in the industry and as a result I'm pretty picky about my food. Basically, I know most chain restaurants are garbage. The quality is garbage, the preparation is garbage, the nutrition is garbage, etc. I go to these places for the social aspect of it . \n\n\nSo, I specifically ordered a very simple meal to avoid disappointment: Loaded cheese fries with bacon. I mean, it's 99% deep fried and assembly should take a nanosecond.\n\n\nIt took forever to get our drinks. Bad start.\n\n\nWhen my meal came there was no bacon. I didn't eat half of it then call her over. I noticed right away. I pushed the food around because I didn't want them to just toss some bacon on my order - I expected new, hot fries (deep frying takes 5 minutes, people) because it's been about 10 minutes of them sitting there getting mushy.\n\n\nThey just tossed the bacon on. Whatever, I was hungry so I was just going to eat it anyway. I'm not even ready to complain... yet. \n\n\nWhen the server handed it over I could tells he was hesitant, but I couldn't see the plate clearly until she'd walked away. The bacon, however, was so burnt it disintegrated in my mouth. You could smell how burnt this bacon was. My guess is they just scraped the inside of some fryer for the bits that broke off during the day.\n\n\nThe waitress avoided my flags for awhile, but when I finally got her over I told her, plainly: \"I *really* can't eat this.\" She giggled awkwardly and admitted she didn't want to actually give it to me in the first place. The fuck? WHY DID YOU THEN? She took the plate and took another 15 minutes to come back if I wanted anything else. I asked how busy, short staffed they were, etc. because I didn't want to just get another pile of shit food. She was honest and said they were pretty busy so I just declined food and starved all night.\n\n\nWhen it came time to pay for our drinks, I could see her kind of lurking over me, so I told her: \"I know you don't control how the kitchen makes food, but you chose to give my burnt bacon so obviously I can't tip you anything whatsoever for this experience.\" \n\nI didn't even get an apology for the way things turned out. Oh, well.",
