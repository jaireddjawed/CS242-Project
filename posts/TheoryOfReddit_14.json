For example, in response to a question about antibiotic resistance, and some of the most upvoted replies will undoubtedly how profits are being put before people in how animal agriculture is conducted, and will remark of how typical that is of American corporations (putting profits before people).  \n\nI've noticed in general that Reddit almost has a sort of fetish for hearing complaints about how greedy and evil American corporations are.

I found that commenting on these was a fantastic way to alleviate boredom at work, as due to their rising popularity you were almost guaranteed to receive a reply + could almost always engage in a long term conversation across the day.\n\nApologies for the long preamble, but essentially my question is, does anyone know what this multireddit was, or know of a single page that would fulfill the same purpose?\n\nThank you in advance for any help.",

But why are Reddit users upset?  Why were there several news stories about [redditors advocating for Net Neutrality (NN)](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/) while at the same time on  r/news permanently banning individuals for posting articles about Net Neutrality.  \n\nPeople seem to believe that ending NN is either a great business opportunity or corporations will censor what you see and will invariably lie or put a spin on what you can find on the Internet, and there will be monopolies and pyramid schemes that will cause ever escalating costs.\n\nBut why would Reddit be upset by an end to NN?  The warnings about what will happen after the death of NN, all sound like the rest of the Internet will become just like Reddit.\n\nReddit decides what you can see and say or can’t see and say.  You can be anonymously banned or down voted indiscriminately with explanation without cause or justification, and there is not regulation of moderator behavior or a true understanding of why some comments or news articles are voted up or down.  There are no standards or enforced regulations to prevent these practices from being corrupt or dishonest.  In other words, exactly the same concerns that people have about the end of NN.  \n\nBut Reddit is not the Internet.  It is just the 10th ranked website on the Internet that exerts  influence on what news stories the public reads on the Internet.  In contrast, the FCC is just deregulating the entire U.S. Internet in a way that gives ISPs complete control over what you see on the Internet.  \n\nThe argument against ending NN will mean that people will be banned from their ISPs for dishonest or corrupt reasons and because those stories are about single individuals those stories will not being told.  In the same manner, the Theory of Reddit and other subreddits discourage the telling of those little stories.  They are relegated to unpopular subreddits where few will see them.\n\nMy question is why do people feel Reddit is OK but the end of NN is not.  In many ways they are the same thing.\n\n",

        "text": "Recently, as I’ve been trawling /r/SubredditDrama as I always do, I’ve noticed brigading from highly upvoted threads happening a lot more often. Now I am not saying it’s from SRD because totesmessenger points out in the linked threads that these threads are linked in many other subs. “Popcorn pissing” as it’s called is explicitly banned and looked down upon by most people in the sub nowadays, whereas back in the day (before my time) subs like SRD were explicitly known and called out for brigading.\n\nLet me say that it’s easy to pick out this behavior for me, because I like to let the conversation in the linked thread and SRD to have matured so I don’t miss any of the drama. It’s especially noticeable when the linked thread is a few days old. For example, I just read a thread linking to a 4-day old comment thread on a conspiracy subreddit (don’t want to link it because this is a thread about brigading after all, but it shouldn’t be too hard to find). The most upvoted comment? A 10-hour old comment with ~650 points that is clearly intended to make fun of and tear down the conspiracy theorist parent comment.\n\nDoes Reddit still have a brigading problem? A few subs were banned before for this, and others were threatened with bans if they kept it up. But it’s been a while since this happened, and I barely see the “what about SRS?” question anymore even. People may have forgotten about this period of Reddit, and there’s certainly been a lot of new posters since then.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Memes and posts about it have been all over r/dankmemes, r/prequelmemes, r/pcmasterrace, r/gaming and numerous other subreddit, most posts talking about it link to the comment and this acts to raise awareness.\n\n\nThe unique fact that this is a comment means that it can't be crossposted. If a post becomes popular it will typically be spread to other subreddit that share that common interest so the karma it gains is spread out across multiple subreddits, however because this is not a post but rather a comment it can only be linked to which directs users to the comment where they are likely to downvote it.\n\nEdit:\n\nAs several people have pointed out a cascade effect did occur, the simple fact it was the most downvoted comment on reddit history made users more likely to down vote it, this also feeds into a question of why we chose do downvote.\n\n[Top 10 Downvoted Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/7cujsc/top_10_downvoted_comments_adjusted_for_ea_oc/?st=ja08d518&amp;sh=7cd3efdb)\n\n[The Score Progression Of The Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/7cq2np/the_score_progression_of_the_new_most_down_voted/?st=ja08dln7&amp;sh=3fc01f22)\n\n\n[The comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/) ",

Not only could it make the Other Discussion tab useful again but it would make it a lot easier in general to share content from one subreddit to another. \n\nHowever, it seems like the vast majority of subs have disabled the feature. On several occasions I've seen a post that I thought would be a great fit for another subreddit and attempted to do a crosspost, only to find the target subreddit doesn't allow them so I don't bother. \n\nOne of the great things about Reddit is that there are so many wonderful and strange and niche subreddits. One of the worst is that in general, subreddit mods seem bound and determined to make subreddit discovery as difficult as possible for the average user.\n\nEDIT: I'm aware that you need to be subscribed to a subreddit to crosspost to it.

        "text": "I have seen numerous users and subreddits claiming that Reddit is comprised of those that are right on the political scale more than those who are left on the political scale. How true is this claim? As much as I have seen, Reddit is the complete opposite, having much more left leaning users than right users. This is just my observation, though, and I am curious as to this claim's authenticity. ",
