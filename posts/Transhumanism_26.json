        "text": "Hello, I have always been into the singularity and merging with technology and I see it happening within my lifetime however the thing that always gets me is the full loss of the biological system. I assume you all know the dilemma of an 'uploaded consciousness' simply being a copy of a person and not truly them. What I have always thought though is, what if you do it slowly?\n\nSay you slowly add digital sectors to the brain, processors implanted in the skull. You form memories in those and begin storing them there. You also do your thinking on them and eventually the rest of your mind is just a base for you being. Then you either slowly transfer each memory and thought process onto the chips and so when your biological cells die naturally you do not even notice. You have neurons dying all the time but you do not notice because others take up the job they had, it would work very much like this. Another option (which i do not see possible within my lifetime unless technology takes a massive unexpected leap due to successful A.I or we find some way to stop the death of neurons is to simply sent in nano machines to slowly replace each neuron then converge together to form some sort of powerful secure chip.\n\n\nThe whole point of this is to have no perception of change that is different then what you experience on a daily basis (aside from the obvious enhancements of a neural interface). No death of self. \n\n\nAssuming a materialist view where our awareness is simply a network of electricity within our brains would it be possible to do achieve what I described? Uploading our consciousnesses slowly enough that we do not notice the death of our biological self? \n\n\nShould there be a chip that was attached to our brain that we could store memories or do calculations on would there be a way that we could make the chip so that we experience it as a faster more powerful version of our brain? Could awareness be extended by and/or exist on an artificial interface?\n\nI have never been on this subreddit before but I assume this question gets asked a-lot. Regardless I think it is a very important one.",
