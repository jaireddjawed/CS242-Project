I’m mostly talking about things which are frequent reference points in common conversation, and there’s sort of an expectation that you’d have seen them. \n\nSome examples of the level I’m thinking of is literally Breaking Bad, Friends, the Office, The Wire, Seinfeld, Stranger Things — juggernauts of culture. I’m also from the UK so I’m also interested in things slightly more relevant here (the Inbetweeners, Peaky Blinders, Fawlty Towers, etc.). \n\nI’m prepared that this list is going to be huge, but what I’m asking is for recommendations of what other programmes I should add to this list as shows most people would expect you to have seen (excluding reality TV). It’s pretty safe to assume I won’t have watched any of them, as I’ve got a bad habit of rewatching the same 4 things over and over. If there’s any you can think of off the top of your head I’d love to hear from you!",

        "text": "Streaming on Netflix is the Green Glove Gang.  It is a Polish show, 8 30 minute episodes in the first season.  It wraps everything up at the end of the season, then in the last 5 minutes lays the groundwork for another season.\n\nThe ladies are probably about 60.  They are a robinhood gang of robbers who steal from the rich and give to the poor.  The gang is wanted by police who have no idea who they are.  So the gang hides out in an old folks home among 70+ year olds.  There they discover bad things going on and use their tricks to make the bad people pay.\n\nIt is listed as a comedy and there is some humor to it, but it is not a show about jokes.  It really has the feel of Leverage.  The three women are best friends with some amusing interaction but the focus is on the investigation and the missions.\n\nIt is a very consistent series - if you like the first episode you will like the rest and if you don't you won't.",

        "text": "\nHey Reddit! I’m currently looking for anyone who’s willing to help with a project I’ve been toying with for a while. Please read below for further details;\n\n#Show’s Name;\n\n86ed\n\n#Premise;\n\nA comedy/drama set in a restaurant following a reporter attempting to investigate the head chef of the establishment who’s previously refused to talk to any press about his previous fall from grace as a head chef of a Michelin star restaurant. He/she does this by going undercover as a dishwasher, however as the show goes on they’ll get promoted, demoted, etc. and the truth behind the head chef’s fall from grace will come to light. \n\n#Why I think it’ll work;\n\nThe genre of 20 minute comedy/drama is massively in demand due to the average person having a low attention span for anything longer. \n\nThe setting of a kitchen/restaurant is one that most people relate to or are curious about and is an untapped market. \n\n#Project type;\n\nThis is an unpaid hobby/passion project *for now*, however if the people interested really work as a team I see no reason why, if the show gets picked up by a streaming service or tv channel, that the team can’t continue to work together in a paid capacity. \n\n#Looking for;\n\nBasically anyone who can help in any capacity! Even if it’s just somebody who knows a lot about tv production and all the necessary steps that need to be taken to get a project off the ground.\n\n#How to get involved;\n\nFeel free to PM me a message or comment on this post and I’ll get into contact with you. Any and all help is greatly appreciated.\n\n#Final Note;\n\nVirtually all of this is open to change and can be discussed with the team.",

        "title": "Apple TV’s “Black Bird” is a compelling psychological thriller with fantastic performances by Paul Walter Hauser and Taron Egerton",

        "text": "I’ve been making my way through Apples tv offerings and just finished Black Bird. It’s a short, sweet 6–episode miniseries that’s already catapulted to the top of my list of best shows of the last few years. \n\nIt’s a intriguing, hooky premise - in order to exonerate himself from a 10 year sentence, a drug dealer must agree to be transferred to a maximum security prison and get a confession out of a serial killer about where he’s hidden the bodies of his victims. The story lived up to this great setup, turning out to be a dark, introspective and often melancholy look at the psyche of damaged people. \n\nThere are plenty of thrills and intense moments throughout the show, but really, the centrepiece and the main reason to watch it are the two lead performances. Paul Walter Hauser is absolutely incredible as the serial killer Larry Hall - so creepy and sinister but with an underlying sadness and tragedy to him. It’s one of those performances that keeps you riveted for every single second he’s on screen. I swear, that weird high pitched voice of his is gonna haunt my nightmares. \n\nTaron Egerton is no slouch either. I’ve really liked his performances in Rocketman and the Kingsman movies, but he really kicks it up a notch here, playing a meathead douche bro character and managing to display a ton of depth and vulnerability. It’s a more grounded performance than Hauser’s but it’s just as well-portrayed, and he makes you feel all of his characters desperation as the walls close in around him. \n\nI highly recommend the show to anyone who’s a fan of things like Mindhunter and True Detective, or just psychological crime thrillers in general.",

You never really see true, Italian mafia, IN ITALY, represented in pop culture.\n\nI came up with a crime drama called Belladonna, about two friends, Remo and Bella, both in the mafia in the fictional city of La Collina (A sort of mix of La Spezia, Amalfi, Cagliari, and Messina) navigating life as members of the mafia until Remo's father, the boss of the mafia, is murdered. This leads to a chaotic chapter where the two must find out who killed Remo's father without involving the police, keeping control of the city from the Russian Mob and larger mafias, and keep the new boss from going power crazy and leading to the mafia's downfall.\n\nHow could I potentially get this show heard, and possibly picked up by something like Netflix? I have a show bible, and everything else I need for a pitch, I simply don't know how, as I'm only 17 years old and don't have the necessary connections.",
