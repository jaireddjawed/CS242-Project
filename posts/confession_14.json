        "text": "I grew up in a dysfunctional household. My bio-parents were divorced, my mother left to do who knows what, and my new step-mom didn't like me whilst also being in a poor relationship with my father. I got my face wiped with used cleaning rags when I didn't clean correctly, things thrown at my head, made to life heavy objects until I couldn't and then whipped with a belt for dropping them. I was shut in a dark room to imitate prison because 'that's where \\[I\\] was going if things didn't change.' I was hit and screamed at and whipped for small things. I was deprived of food and socializing. I was made to do parent assigned homework during any free time. From the age of 12 I spent 80% of my time grounded until I left for college, and  when I wasn't I was still treated like this but now I got to watch tv when my parents did. \n\nI wasn't a bad kid- I was at the top of my class from a young age, I didn't misbehave outside of the regular pre-teen attitude, I cleaned my room, I helped cook, I cleaned the house. I was a good kid. And yet I was treated like the scum of the earth. \n\nFast forward, I'm in my mid 20's with many a mental issue. Depression, anxiety, anger issues, poor coping skills, etc. I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old. I have learned as much as I can about gentle parenting and I have tried as hard as I am able to implement it. I suspect I may also have post partem rage. Toddlers are hard for the most experienced , level-headed parents. I am neither, and I spend my days trying not to hurt my children. Some days I can handle full melt downs without raising my voce and on others, the tiniest mistake makes me want to hit my 3 year old and scream in their face. I am kept up at night with vivid images of hurting them and endless sorrow because 'Why, fucking why am I thinking these things'\n\nI'm aware they're children. I'm aware that the monsters in my head are product of my upbringing. I am aware that this is wrong and I hate myself for it.",

And I let him down.\n\nI split on him (in a very projected way.  I.E. it was really my bio father I was trying to hurt but he's dead and D was the closest figure and took the brunt of my anger)\n\nI did everything I could to get him fired.  It didn't work, thankfully, but I'll never forgive myself for betraying him like that.  \n\nIt's been over two years and I still have bad dreams about what I did.  Before I quit the job, I wrote him a long letter apologizing and trying to explain the reasoning behind it.  I was too chicken shit to see him face to face.  A few days after I quit, my old co-worker told me she saw D read my letter -twice, and was crying.   I messaged him in a drunk fit of crying that I was sad I would no longer see him.  And then I blocked his number because I was so fearful of both being ignored and getting a response.  \n\nI've done a lot of shitty things in my life, but I regret this the most.",

I would drink whenever I could get my hands on alcohol because it was the only way I knew how to escape. I would do all kind of stupid shit when I was drunk, try to fight people, verbally abuse people for no reason, throw up in peoples houses etc. i would often get angry at my parents for no reason and once I even had a fight with my dad. \n\n2 yrs ago aged 17 I met up with 3 girls and a male friend. I had had a lot to drink at this rate. I was sitting in a bench with one of the girls and I put my arm around her. She did not object to this so I thought I was on the next stage of flirting. I asked ro kiss her, she said no to that. A minute later I asked again and a minute after that I asked once more. All 3 times were rejected. Eventually i came to my senses and realise my attention was unwanted. I feel as though if I was physically stepping the line someone would have intervened. I cant actually remember any of this happening, this is just what I got told. I never forced myself on this person and I didn’t get aggressive or violent when rejected. After this happened she and all her friends left the venue and texted my friend that I fucked up and that no means no. I probably freaked her out bad. I didn’t understand what I was doing and I thought I was flirting but I got it horribly wrong and upset someone \n\nEveryone alienated me after this, all 4 people involved stopped talking to me. My friend was extremely angry with me and started calling me a harasser. \nDue to the response provided I have false memories of what happened. I only asked for a kiss but my mind keeps telling me that I groped/raped her because of how angry everyone was after the situation. I live in constant mental imprisonment. \nI know for a fact I had no bad intentions but in my drunken state I got it horribly wrong. \n\n\n\n When I heard about my actions the next morning I felt disgusted with myself, I instantly apologised to the girl I did it to. \nLooking back it was quite s lame apology, I said some shit like “I’m sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable last night I was really drunk” i didn’t know what to say\nShe told me she forgave me, my friend told me that she was initially upset after it had happened that I pushed her boundaries, but she accepted my apology. I don’t know if she just said this to make me feel better or what not but yeah. That was the last time i spoke to all the people involved. I feel disgusted within myself, I feel like a predator who kept pushing someone. I feel as though I might have traumatised her and ruined her life cos this was such a bad experience. It was after that I stopped drinking alcohol as a whole because I was now aware of its destructive nature. I haven’t done a thing of this nature since and realised that it was the alcohol dictating me. \n\nAfter I apologised I didn’t think too much of the incident, but 18 months later for some reason it’s come back into my mind and it’s all I think about 24/7. I really can’t understand why I did what I did. I certainly wouldn’t have done it sober, but I’ve realised that it’s no excuse. Their friend said to my friend it wasn’t that much of a big deal but I still can’t forget about it. \nI feel like a piece of shit for trying to do something without the other person’s consent. I was verbally asking for consent but I was being pushy about it. \nSince this has been of my mind, I haven’t allowed myself to have anormal life, I’ve since quit my job and I hardly leave my room. I feel as though this is who I’m gonna be forever. That drunk idiot that kept asking. I told one of my friends bout it and he said it wasn’t a big deal. I can’t even look my own mother in the eye knowing the way I treated a woman that night. No charges were ever pressed or anything, idk if I did something illegal or not but it was certainly immoral. \nI don’t know if asking for a kiss more than once is illegal (might fall under harassment) \nBut I feel I should’ve received some punishment for my actions \nI hate myself for it every day and I’ve been thinking about ending my life over this. Once u do something like this in todays society there is no going back. \n\n\nAlthough im 2 years sober and wont do something like this again I just cant let the past go. This haunts me 24/7 and honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever forgive myself for it. \nI thought of myself as an ally of women but this situation says that I wasn’t. \n\nI’m a pig. A disgusting man who ignored boundaries. I’m sorry to all women that have to deal w shit like this. I’ve heard some horror stories from some other girls and the stuff u have to put up with us disgusting. I wouldn’t consider myself a part of that domain but this encounter proves otherwise. \n\nI physically cry my eyes out when I see my mother. I’ve failed her, she told me to respect women growing up and I fucked it.",

It started with Snapchat, I found out too late that the screenshot and saving pictures notifications can be bypassed by… well I won’t say how here. Then used telegram. which is nice for privacy but won’t notify if someone is saving your pictures. I just feel like every link or image I get from a family or friend will contain a pic of me, or if someone is trading pictures of me rn because I know that’s something people do. I don’t know if I’ll ever feel at calm again and I wouldn’t wish this feeling on anyone.",
