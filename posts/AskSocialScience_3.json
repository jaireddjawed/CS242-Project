But around people I know well, I'm hyper, energetic, and very extroverted.\n\nI like going to parties with big groups, but after those parties, I'm burned out and don't feel like being around people for a while.\n\nIf the party is full of mostly people I barely know, I'm usually silent with most, but I'll try to talk to a few people in a big group or party to try and form a connection.\n\nI usually don't like being the speaker during presentations or speech moments but if everyone in my group really wants to avoid doing it, I'll usually do it to save people slack and so people will appreciate I did something no one else wanted to do.\n\nI'll lead groups if no one else wants to and I have an idea of what we can do. If I don't really understand the topic of a project or it involves something I'm not as familiar with, I'll step down and let someone else lead me or tell me what to do.\n\nWould these traits I mentioned make me more of an ENTJ or INTJ, or an odd mixture of both?",

Ergo, any concerns about young people being lured or tempted to explore an orientation different from their original one would be false.\n\nBut what if the first sentence is not correct? What if it should read: \"....a large majority of gay or hetero people are set in their orientations; they were born that way.\"\n\nIsn't this what Sexual Fluidity Theory posits?  \"Most, but not all?\"   And the Theory also helps explain bisexuality?

On the other hand the term \"Objective\" has overtaken our culture in a very radical way: Even laymen that are not active academics or scientists use it all the time as a form of speech. Government, the Judicial brunch especially, laws, taxes, court hearings - pretty much every corner of our existence has been infiltrated by this concept. One could say our whole lives are centered around it - The way we work and structure our lives, how we speak and form thoughts and sentences, etc.....\n\nI have found some resources on Journalistic Objectivism (It started in the 20th century) but am struggling to find more readings on the topic, specifically on HOW and WHEN this phenomenon really started. I understand that this is a question which is intersectional - history, philosophy, social sciences but I would appreciate any input or references you might have. \n\nThe fact that we did not always subscribe to this type of speech is really interesting to me and hence I am inquiring more into it's history but with little success.",

I think puberty is disgusting and everyone else my age is gross and hormonal and whiny and pmsing and boy crazy and I’m superior and normal and clean and not boy crazy. \n\nI just love milfs which is way better and also I have a superiority complex bc my parents think I barely go through puberty. Like I shave my armpits every 10 hours so they can never catch me lacking and I strategically steal my moms deodorant every morning and she has no idea and she just thinks I never need it (I never do bc I’m clean but just in case) And I make sure I don’t eat food with added hormones in them so my boobs don’t get big and I don’t get sexualized.\n\nAnd also I make it known that I want nothing to do with boys and my parents think I’m superior because of this and it fuels my superiority complex. And I love milfs instead of boys and when milfs give me validation and attention it fuels my superiority complex so much idk why. Especially when they see that not interested in boys and studious instead.\n\n Every day I go on quora and the parenting subreddit and look up “puberty” to see parents posts about their kids’ struggles with puberty and it makes me feel so superior bc I know I don’t deal with that, nor do my parents know about any “struggles” I might have with puberty.\n\nWhat is the psychological reason for this and why am I obsessed with avoiding puberty, sex, and boys?\n\nAnd please don’t say “puberty is completely normal and natural” It won’t help me accept anything and I already know the biology behind puberty. I know that it’s natural but idc it’s disgusting and I’m like a different species of human with superior genetics bc I’m not gross and hormonal. I’m 15 and a girl by the way.",

        "text": "I had a thought. Or have been having this menacing feeling that I’m just not very good at coming up what I’m good at.\n\nIt started out with me thinking about unemployment, and my own place therein. I was thinking that there has to be a way to sort of like hogwart’s hat your way into a place of employ. I’ve no idea of all the multitude of positions you could have even at 35 let alone at 18. I want a standard protocol that interacts with the entire world wide job market. I think it might be helpful.  Every single position for every single job, and an outlier of what attributes you would do good having getting into a job. \n\nPractically, if ever complete, it would have the strength that you, in your school years find out your strengths and weaknesses and then this protocol, this system will edge out all of the places of employ that you’d be optimal working. However, for it to ever be complete it would require a sizable portion of people who can sit and list these attributes, and connect them to jobs, though it feels like it would naturally fall to employers who already have this way in their mind. Maybe just not on paper. As in on protocol. Also, for every single new type of job or even position, there would require someone going through the pain to list what type of person to be best suited for it. And if it sounds like this is already something that exists, you’d be right. But it doesn’t exist as a complete system, in which you could get info of positions for jobs in Mumbay in your search results when graduating school. \n\nI come to you with a bit of a stupid question. What even are the attributes that make out the human body? You’d need standardized catch words. Instead of “being good at retaining a lot of information “ you’d have “booksmart” (hey don’t come to me for examples). The ability of retention of text is an attribute. Even though it is made out of a host of functions of our brain. Do you have any more examples other than STR, INT and STAM?\n\nDo you like my idea? Coming from a person that likes things to be systematic, and are too humble to ever tell anyone I’m good at anything, having a teacher assign your standardized stats at graduation, kinda like having a character sheet for your person.",

She is still dating me, but sometimes I wonder about the ethics of dating with respect to race.\n\nIs it okay to put down dating white men considering the privilege they hold?\n\nPersonally, I do not want anyone to feel like they should not be dated because of their race, no matter the race. However, I have been reading that it is different for white people, based on punching up versus punching down. In this case, I was wondering if punching up as in saying it is bad to date a man that is white is okay. Now, I also think it is wrong to want to date a white man because he is white, just like it would be wrong to date anyone because of their race.

Put differently, if corporations increase prices and the demand barely changes, doesn't this mean the market has now moved closer to equilibrium?  \n\nLastly, if corporations increase prices and people are still (begrudgingly) happy to pay these prices, aren't corporations merely profiting off the excessive demand relative to the finite supply of their products?

        "text": "From Thinking In Systems: A Primer;\n\n\"Take markets, for example, the balancing feedback systems that are all but worshipped by many economists. They can indeed be marvels of self-correction, as prices vary to moderate supply and demand and keep them in balance. Price is the central piece of information signaling both producers and consumers. The more the price is kept clear, unambiguous, timely, and truthful, the more smoothly markets will operate. Prices that reflect full costs will tell consumers how much they can actually afford and will reward efficient producers. Companies and governments are fatally attracted to the price leverage point, but too often determinedly push it in the wrong direction with subsidies, taxes, and other forms of confusion. These modifications weaken the feedback power of market signals by twisting information in their favor. The real leverage here is to keep them from doing it. Hence, the necessity of antitrust laws, truth-in-advertising laws, attempts to internalize costs (such as pollution fees), the removal of perverse subsidies, and other ways of leveling market playing fields.\"\n\n[According to this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/nyregion/loneliness-epidemic.html), loneliness causes physical health problems, and was exceedingly common even before the pandemic. This implies that loneliness has an economic cost; less healthy people means less productive workers. \n\nIf externalities like pollution can be internalized, can more subjective costs be internalized too? Can economic policy have an effect on loneliness and burnout?",

To even say some males by sex have feminine qualities or some females are masculine is to reinsert - being gender imposing about - traditional notions of gender into a context that is trying to get away from that. \n\nBut if we are to respect one's identification, then we must respect the very large number of people who identify according to those traditional notions of gender. I would call that gender conscious, to be aware of one's own view of gender in comparison to other genders and views on gender.\n\nThere seems to be tension or conflict between what advocates of gender awareness want - to get away from traditional notions of binary gender - and their philosophy - individuals should be more aware of their gender identity in comparison with others. Greater awareness could simply result in greater conflict or suffering.\n\nThis is my admittedly naive and unlearned thought about this interesting topic.

What social/cultural developments led to Russia being more sexually liberal than China?",

However, Ive read Plato, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Tocqueville, Burke, Rawls and Nozick which were all recommended to me. Overall I'd say I have a good grasp on political theory. So I'm looking for more.\n\nSpecifically, I'd want a textbook that covers multiple fields of political science, such as comparative politics, international relations, ideologies, elections etc. Suited for an undergrad level of study I guess? I'm not sure as I am self-studying this. Thanks in advance.",

Ranging from Poland to Hungary to Russia, these states are extremely right-wing in their policies. What developments made Eastern European countries right-wing? Is it a counterculture movement to Communism? If so, why did they choose to be socially right-wing rather than liberal?",
