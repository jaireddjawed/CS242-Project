        "text": "I used to work as a cashier at a drugstore and I would say I was friends with most of my coworkers. We were primarily women in our early-mid 20's and also students. With that job I was forced to talk to strangers and make small talk as well as having the opportunity to talk with my coworkers about more serious/interesting things. However, once I quit due to getting a job in my field of work, I've become so much more socially anxious. I work from home mostly, and in the 2 days I do go into the office, I don't talk much with other because I have so much work constantly being thrown at me with short deadlines. \n\nIf there's one thing about me that I know that works, and I have talked about with my therapist is that exposure therapy works for me. However, I am very socially anxious so I never go out to places on my own, and I don't have many friends anymore. But I would like to make friends and become more social. I am thinking of joining Bumble BFF just to see if that can help me make friends, but I worry about my social skills. I think for the most part they're okay but idk. Is there any way I can improve my social skills at home or do yall think I would just have to force myself to go out (like exposure therapy).",

It was an instant connection at a party, we hit it off and soon after she was visiting my house, going on family roadtrips and meeting all my other friends. In June 2022, a number of factors accumulated and I cut her off from my life. Things such as a breach of trust (she sent a sex related tiktok to a creepy guy friend she knows and said it was sent from me which led him to make some disgusting comments about me which she showed me later, threatening me to ask someone out when I wasn't ready and also telling someone we both don't like where my house is). As well as this, I was very emotionally drained by her. She would constantly put herself in terrible situations (creepy guy friends, joining a community of toxic people, reminiscing and wanting to fix an abusive ex) and then complain to me about her predicament or vent about these toxic people to me. It was fine if the venting was occasional but it was happening every conversation. There were times where I felt myself becoming immune to badly gossiping about random people and becoming okay with bodyshaming and misandry. All of these reasons led me to cut her off. She profusely apologised but I needed time to myself for a while.\n\nIn December 2022, I reached out to her and we became friends again. I could tell she was trying really hard to maintain our friendship again. Although I didn't ask for so much, she was going to my college event to meet me, paying for my meal, texting me frequently, and inviting me to her house too. I was very grateful she wanted to try again and I did too. But my problem is that I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, just waiting for the next red flag to show itself so I can tell myself I was right for cutting her off in the first place. I'm the one who reached out asking if we could hang out again so why is my mind constantly on guard? I also always calculate in my brain what words to say to make sure I tell her enough about my life but not too much that it could be used against me. Our hangouts aren't the same anymore either, theres longer gaps of silence, very random superficial topics brought up and when she's venting to me about a toxic friend/ex/guy my brain just turns off and I don't register anything when before I could listen and be engaged for ages. \n\nI don't know what I'm supposed to do because clearly I am the problem this time and I want to be better. I want to be more trusting and I know she's trying hard to show me she is. Anyone who's been in a similar situation and found a solution - help?",

I’m always curious and I love being that way, but it sometimes starts to feel more like a talk show interview than a conversation. I’m not really afraid of silence or pauses as much as I used to be. So I let pauses and silence happen and still a lot of times I can tell they have to scramble to come up with something. I just wish people had more curiosity about me like I do about them. \nDoes anyone have advice or stories to share? Should I leave the conversation earlier when people aren’t contributing much?",

        "text": "So, a little bit of backstory: I am a senior college student in my last semester of college living with 3 of my sorority sisters. We lived together in our chapter house our sophomore and junior year. We also are part of the same pledge class (about 6 girls in total). Howbeit, I spend a lot of time at my boyfriends apartment, and it feels like they are disliking me because of it? I met my boyfriend November of 2021 and I have always spent more time at his place as he is 25, I am 21, he did not really like going to the chapter house which was totally understandable to me. He would still go sometimes though. One of my roommates admitted to me the other month that she had hoped I was okay when I had spent all my time there. But, that makes me question why she did not ask me when it was happening if I were okay? I was, but it was the principle for me. This friend also particularly tells me my job does not make enough money as a bartender, but it is my college job and I do like working there. She also repeats the same conversations all the time? For example, I will see her in the living room and she will ask me what I’m doing that night, which is nothing because it is a Thursday night and I would prefer to smoke inside with my boyfriend instead of blacking out at our college bars. She talks in a way that it seems like she wants to make me feel bad for not going although I genuinely would not have had a good time there because the last time the four of us hung out together I had planned it and they had just talked over me the entire time. Anyways, I heard my roommates in the kitchen the other day say that I have not been working a lot, and they always reach out to me first, and it’s “WEIRD.” One of them said I had not been working a lot but I worked last Wednesday Thursday and Friday with her? For context, the bar is only open Wednesday-Saturday. I also have not been working a lot because my grandpa and a close friend of mine who also was a coworker passed away suddenly at the end of January and I have never had anyone close to me ever pass away in my life. They know about this through liking my obituary link on Facebook. They also said since my parents pay my rent, that I can afford to not work. Weird really hurt my feelings because sometimes I do feel weird compared to others. Anyways, the things they said were not true. Should I confront them about this? I’m an introvert so it would be hard for me especially since the three of them are confrontational. I feel like they would just end up attacking me so I chose peace and after I heard them talking about me I angrily said bye and left for my boyfriends apartment. The next day, yesterday, my roommate I talked about in the beginning did not say hi to each other when we saw each other in the house we just looked at each other and she left the house probably to go to her boyfriends house since it was around 6pm. Moreover, sometimes when I work until 1am I stay at my house overnight instead of my boyfriends which is like once or twice a month. That roommate in the beginning if I see her the next morning will always ask if I had stayed at our house last night. Do I have a right to be mad about this, and should I tell her that it bothers me when she asks this? The way she says it makes me think that she anticipated my boyfriend and I had a fight so that is why I stayed at our house. I would appreciate any advice on this. I have been distancing myself and I have all a’s right now and have been exercising everyday smoking everyday which are something I love. Also when my boyfriend got me a clear bong for Christmas that I picked out, that beginning roommate said wouldn’t it be hard to keep clean, but it’s mine so like why does it matter? It’s little things like this that have slowly pushed me away. Especially since I always have to reach out first even though they said it’s always them in the kitchen but they do not even try, I am an introvert and have had the worst January. I do not know whether to acknowledge these issues or not because it is so awkward in our house. I feel fine about the distance but it is really hostile. They do not make me feel good when we hangout so I stopped asking. They had an inside joke between the three of them said in the group message the other day also and I did not respond. Was I supposed to? Other times I am blatantly ignored by them in the group message.",

This year, I've made the decision to celebrate my birthday with my family, something I haven't done in the past decade. During my university years, I was always away at school on my birthday, and shortly after graduation, I moved hundreds of miles away for work. Last year, I spent my birthday with my best friends, but this year, I'm choosing to be with my family.\n\nLosing my dad two years ago has made me realize how important it is to spend special moments with loved ones. I regret not spending a single birthday with him in person, and I hope he forgives me in spirit.\n\nMy only birthday wish this year is to find a job that appreciates my skills and takes care of my mental health.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post, and I hope you have a wonderful day!",

He says \"Wow, not inviting me?\", which kind of pissed me off, and did not want to invite him at all anymore. Of course, me being nice, I said he could come and when and where it would be happening and he just gave me a nod. Don't know if I should tell him the truth now or not tell him anything at all.",

        "text": "Ever since I was a kid, I have had trouble making friends. I was and still am a very quiet person around large groups and people I don't know. It also doesn't help that I tend to not be smiley or emote much facially or when talking. I have often times been scolded at work for not smiling enough and looking too serious. I brought up to my mom the idea of me having ASD. She thinks that I am just shy and once I put myself out there things will fall into place. Maybe she is right, but idk. I do know I am pretty closed off and need to work on that. I will say that alot of times I feel like I can only be myself at home around family. When I go out in public its like I have a mask on, idk how to explain it any better.\n\nAnother aspect or pattern I have noticed about myself is that I usually keep one close friend at a time. And once we transition out of where we met( for example school), the friendship dwindles. From elementary to high school I had one close friend who I'd actually hang out with outside of school. It also helped that their mom and my mom became friends. When I got to college the friendship became distant. The summer of my second year I wanted to hang out. We made plans and they kept pushing it back or inviting other people( I did not mind this, I actually wanted his other friends to come). Eventually he stopped responding and I got the message. We haven't spoken since then and  this was about 6 yrs ago (we're both 24 now). There was no big argument we just stopped. I have never asked him what happened, even though it hurt alot then. It bothers me now and again, but not as much.\n\n I did have alot of what I would call surface level friendships in elementary- high school. We would talk and joke at school in general, but never outside of it. I even kind of fell into a group. I would talk to this group everyday in high school. After graduation I rarely spoke to any of them. It was like I could never breach into true friendship. There were other people who would talk to me as well. People did think I was funny, but even still we just never became real friends. I even remember one girl saying I should be voted funniest, but I was like you know damn well not many people know me like that.\n\n In college I got to do a summer program and it was so interesting to watch how quickly groups formed. I literally could never understand how friendships were formed in a matter of weeks.\nMe and another girl were on the outside of these two groups.No one was mean to us though. Even just thinking back I think others wanted to hang out, but I never picked up on it.This girl became my only close friend in college. We would hang out often and get lunch and talk. We graduated 3 yrs ago and we catch up from time to time by text. Currently I have not texted her in a while.Again just like in high school, there were also people who I'd say hi and talk a little with. They also thought I was funny as well.Other than hanging out with my friend, I didn't have the average college experience of having a group of friends to do stuff with.\n\n Right now I am in a slump. I have been job hunting for a while with nothing to show for it. I feel embarrassed as I literally have nothing positive regarding my life to talk about. Which is why I haven't been texting my college friend. Before I had to leave my previous job, I only felt bad about not having much or any friends on occasion. Losing my job has just exacerbated these negative feelings. A thought that crosses my mind more often now is how I feel so forgettable. It's like I leave no impression. Alot of times my mind will run on an old classmate or co-worker.Then I'll think too myself, they probably don't even remember me. I have always wondered if something is wrong with me.Right now I'm not looking for friends as my self esteem is the lowest it's ever been due to being jobless. Sometimes I am even ok with staying in the house all day. I don't drink or go clubbing so I dont feel I'm missing out on that. I remember my last job it was a group of people all around my age. They had all been working together some for months and some for weeks. It amazed me how they talked so freely with each other. Like they had known each other for mad long. We all went out to a bar after work once and I was so uncomfortable. I just wanted to go home so badly. I also feels like this ties back into my job hunt as I don't know how to form connections in general, yet alone network. I did notice that me and some other co- workers would get to work early. I'd talk more openly when it was just a couple of us. Once the whole group came I became dead silent.\n\n Other days I wish I had people to go to a movie or travel with. I fear once I land a job and get my money up, it will be super hard to find people and form friendships.I hear alot of people saying that someone having no friends is a red flag. I understand why people think this way, but hearing this makes me feel like I have no chance. Sorry this is so long, I just wanted to vent.",

I waited, but was hesitant to reach out. I assumed the person who initially brought it up, would do that if they wanted to still meet. I should note it’s just 4 coworkers, 2 guys and me and another woman. The person who initially wanted to plan it out is one of the guys. The other  guy said he couldn’t make it, so I’m not sure if that played a role in it not happening. I can at times assume everything is my fault.",

He talked to me but didn’t respond to either of the messages about rescheduling. On Wednesday we were talking and I was having a bad day so I vented about my day. It was nothing serious I was just kind of stressed and told him about some of the stuff that was happening. After I vented he disappeared and didn’t respond all evening. Then Thursday he didn’t respond all day. I talked to my therapist about it and we talked about how these things are a pattern with this person and I need to set boundaries. Today I sent this message: \n\n“I feel upset that you completely didn’t respond to these messages where I was venting even all day yesterday you didn’t even say sorry good luck on your paper or anything. I also feel upset that we planned to see each other Monday and I got really excited and next thing you know we have to cancel which is fine but then you ignored the messages I sent asking if we can reschedule and didn’t even suggest to try to make a plan for another day. I just feel upset by these actions and I feel frustrated because I feel like it’s so easy to just repair these kinds of things by just saying “sorry you were stressed have a good day today” “sorry we cancelled does this day work for you so we can see each other?” But instead you just disappeared on me yesterday or ignored messages where I tried to reschedule and I don’t understand why. As friends I feel like we need to respect each other, care for each other and show that.” \n\nHe didn’t respond to the message and has continued ignoring me since Wednesday evening. I feel so anxious and stressed out. I’m second guessing myself but I still feel upset by his actions. \n\nDid I phrase the message badly? What do I do. \n\nTLDR: can someone read the message and tell me if I phrased it badly or what else I should do.",

        "text": "I'm currently a high school senior. At the start of high school, I'd essentially decided that I wouldn't bother making friends. I was pretty depressed at the time, and while I'd talk to a few people, I never put in effort to hang out with anyone. I was alright with this for a while up till just a couple months ago. I'd finally found a ADHD medication and dosage that worked for me, which let me start to get my life in order. Mid January I had a revelation that I wasn't a complete failure. I noticed my weight going down, gaining muscle, grades improving, and I gained some hobbies that I enjoyed. Right with this revelation, I very suddenly felt extremely lonely. I had no one to talk to, hang out with, or anything.\n\nIn my junior year, I shared a class with a few people that I didn't feel like completely shutting off to. One girl in particular I felt weirdly comfortable around. I took part in group conversations when she spoke, I always enjoyed listening to her talk so much about stuff she enjoyed, and she got me to do things I'd never even think about doing, like singing in front of the class during a presentation. But even still, I shut myself off and never tried to make friends. I didn't understand that the way I felt about that girl was more than just being \"weirdly comfortable.\"\n\nWhen I was hit with that jarring feeling of loneliness, this is what came to my mind. How much I enjoyed, relatively, being around that group of people. Particularly her. I now suddenly feel such a strong need to at least try to get to know them. If I'm able to start talking to them and I end up not enjoying my time, I think I'd be fine just moving on. It's being able to prove that I can make friends, I believe, that's really hurting me right now.\n\nWhy just them? Dunno. Anyone I sit by in my current classes are, for various reasons, not people I'd enjoy being friends with. I doubt they'd want to make friends with me either, since at the beginning of the year, I did the same thing I'd done before. Close off. So at the beginning of the year, when everyone is talking to the new people around them, I fought them off, in some misguided crusade.\n\nProblem is, I don't share any classes with them this year, almost never see them walking around, and have no clue where they have lunch. Essentially, my only idea of how to re-introduce myself is to hope I eventually see them walking between classes, and somehow work up the courage to ask if I could sit with them at lunch. Even if by some anomaly all this happens and they let me join them... what then? I'm ***horrible*** at talking to people, isolating myself and all. But being the one who asked to join, I'll be expected to try start conversation.\n\nI'm not sure what I'm making this post for. Asking for people's opinions on my problem I suppose. Or I just needed to write down the thoughts consuming me for over a month. I'd happily take any advice.",

I'm not interested in a relationship (I'm a solid 3/10 so I'm not going to dilude myself), I just need more practice talking to women. I know most guys would be frustrated or downtrodden if that happened to them, you think some girl is interested in you just to turn out they only wanted to be friends, but I'm not sure about vice versa. I feel like giving someone your number sort of implies a deeper interest, but like im not sure, i just need practice man. What do you think? Should I try it or just stick to my reading when I go out?",

        "text": "I am F26 and there is this girl I don’t really like in my current friend group. I was in therapy over the last year on setting boundaries with this girl and healing from her. We used to be really good friends but we just have extremely different definitions of what it mean to be close friends, she very poor at communicating, and is very unaware of how passive aggressive she  could get. She doesn’t really like to deal with issues and lives in denial a lot of the times and tends to be extremely non confrontational and runs away from her problems regardless of the people she hurts. She would very much be the person to ghost people as soon as things become difficult. And it really hurt me and I’ve just kept her at a distance over the past year since then. \n\n\nWere in the same friend group so I just keep her as an acquaintance friends, if I had the choice I would’ve cut all contact her, but I can’t. But like sometimes she can be so obnoxious and it really irritates me sometimes. Like her mannerisms are really rude sometimes and it just really annoys me. I currently live in la for school but all my friends are from norcal. Everytime there is a break I go back to norcal and hit up the large group chat, but honestly recently I haven't been wanting to because I don't even want to see that girl in a large group setting. I don't mind it if someone else hits everyone up and we all hang together but if it were my choice I don't want to go out of my way to invite her to hang. I instead want to just put on my instagram story telling my friends when I'm back in norcal and to hmu if they wanted to hang and then I would just hang out with the friends who hmu. \n\n\nBut I feel so immensely guilty for not hitting up the large group chat because it's actually pretty unusual for me to not let at least my main group know, through group chat, that I am back during these dates and telling everyone to hang. Because I, out of all my friends, am always the person to always initiate hang outs. One time when I went back during a school break I didn't hit up the group chat and let everyone know. And when I hit up individual friends I think they were really confused because they were wondering why I didn't just let everyone know and instead just hit up individual people. But it was because I didn't want to hang out with that girl. I don't know what to do.",

        "text": "Lately I've been focusing on socializing more. I've always been reserved because I always assumed people would react negatively to me trying to engage. \n\nI've had some good results, mostly I can make people laugh somewhat often, I'm very sarcastic and kind of silly in a way that people seem to be responding, which is great!\n\nBut no matter what I do, beyond entertaining folks for a few minutes, I just can't seem to vibe with anyone. \n\nI can't hold conversations for long because I feel like I have nothing interesting to say, so I usually just end it early with some awkward joke and laugh. But I've noticed people talking and often just talking about nothing! They seem to somehow make the most mundane subjects interesting and worth having a 30 min conversation over.\n\nI've reflected over this many times, and looking back I've always had this difficulty, more so than anything else. And after thinking about it, it seems it's just a lack of chemistry with people. I just don't relate to anyone. I like stuff no one I know really does, people don't get my references, my passions.\n\nI don't relate to people my age, my country has a huge party culture, and I don't get partying,  or drinking. I like calm and chill places to talk and laugh, no substance involved, which others seem to find boring.\n\nAnyway, all of this really makes me feel like an alien, an outsider. As much as I've been working, and as much progress as I've made over the last years, I can't help but always notice how different I feel from everyone, and this is really bumming me out. I feel I'm missing a lot of experiences in life because I don't get along with most people beyond friendly acquaintances. I've never had a \"group\", for instance. You know that group of friends who are inseparable and are always together? Yeah, never experienced that.\n\nSo, does anyone else knows the feeling? Would love some advices, but just listening to people who can relate would be really great as well.",

This was mainly because we got to know each other better in school since we shared some of the same classes. Anyways, we initially started talking more often at meets, and began hanging out with each other more often. Fast forward to a few track meets later, she starts asking me about chess, since she knew I was into it and quite good (nerdy I know). Anyways, she started talking to me more, and I started to teach her how to play. I then started to FaceTime her, and would play chess/talk with her then. I obviously liked her this whole time, however a few things held me back. To start with, sometimes she would be busy and couldn't FaceTime. This wasn't a big deal though, as we were FaceTiming pretty much every other day. I also asked her to hangout and she said she couldn't unfortunately, but then she proposed doing some coursework and meeting up at a local restaurant/outdoor coffee lounge. We did that, and it went great. I think she may have been checking me out/into me, as I kinda caught her looking at me during the time, and she seemed to laugh a lot and have a good time. Today, I asked her if she wanted to go to a local trendy restaurant, and she replied \"probably, if I feel well enough after the competition the day before\". I said ok, and that we can make it a plan, and she can text me the morning of if she's feeling too tired. I don't take this as a red flag as I had the same thing happen after competitions. Do you think she's into me? Are there any ways that may confirm it either way? I need some guidance.",

(Like a nice meal with a good friend.)\n\nWhen you feel that warmth take hold, open your eyes and look at yourself in the mirror, what do you notice?\n\n👉️ **Why you're doing it:**\n\nAn important skill to develop is the skill of seeming approachable to others. \n\nThe more approachable you are, the easier your interactions will be. We’ll be using warm eye contact in a few later challenges, so get a feel for it now.\n\n🔴 **Does this challenge feel too hard?**\n\nMake warm eye contact with one person.\n\n🟢 **Does this challenge feel too easy?**\n\nMake warm eye contact with 3 people and say \"Hi\" to them. (no need to start a conversation, just say hi)\n\n**Be sure to follow me so you don't miss the next challenge!**\n\n----------------------------------------\n*Disclaimer: In some counties, eye contact is considered rude/aggressive if that's the case in your country, what could you do instead? Come up with some ideas in the comments for others!*",

We’ve exchanged the occasional hello and smile every now and then but never really had a conversation. I want to clarify I’m not pursuing her, I’m happily single and not looking for a relationship, least of all with someone I work with, so this isn’t about that. \n\nLogically if you want to be friends with someone you should just be able to go up to them and say hi and start chatting, but personally.. I really feel like I need an excuse. I just feel weird and awkward otherwise. Especially when it’s a girl. \n\nSo I was thinking I’d go to her when she isn’t busy and say something like:\n\n“Hey _____ do you have a minute? I was on Facebook this morning and I saw you come up as a suggested friend, and I went to add you but then thought ‘I’ve never actually had a real conversation with this girl’ which is kinda crazy because I literally see you most days and we have mutual friends and stuff. You seem really chill and nice and I could use more work friends, so I just thought I’d say hey”\n\nDoes that sound okay? Would I sound strange saying something like that?",

When I was in community college, I struggled with socializing and making friends. I went to some on campus clubs and events, but had trouble actually talking to people. I would mostly just sit there not saying anything, outside of a few sentences, feeling frustrated not knowing what was preventing me from talking to people.\n\nThe reason I got academically dismissed from the college I transferred to was because I was going to approach it as a fresh start, to have the friends and relationships that I couldn't get myself to have in community college. But I still struggled with socializing with people, even in the on campus clubs I joined, and that made me depressed and dejected and I stopped talking my classes seriously/overslept and stopped going to class a lot.\n\nIf I was going to go back I'd have to know that I had the social skills to make friends and relationships with people this time so that wouldn't happen again. I've been working a retail job since being academically dismissed and I still struggle with socializing. I still don't talk much, feeling like there's something holding me back from being able to socialize like a normal person like my coworkers do. I've been going to therapy for around 8 months and it's helped a little bit but I still struggle a lot and need to figure out how to be able to socialize with people like a normal person.

Specifically the event was for people in their 20s and 30s.\n\nIt was mostly a fun night and I was chatting with some people after. Age came up in conversation. I said I was 27 and the people I was talking to said they were 30 and 31. Apparently they thought I was like 22 and there was a shift in the conversation when I said I was older than that, as if they were taking me more seriously now and not just \"being nice to the kid here\" or something like that. \n\nI had a similar interaction the weekend before where I was at a bar and tried to strike up a conversation with someone. They responded with, \"I'm sorry how old are you?\" like I was barely old enough to be there. Again I'm 27 and this woman was 29. \n\nI know I'm a few years younger than these people, but that's not a big gap. We're all single, out of school, and working full time -- so to me it seems like we're all in the same stage of life. \n\nAny advice on how to seem a bit older? I've been thinking about it and I don't think I said anything or did anything that would make me seem immature or in the just out of college crowd.",

Like for example, I know a lot of people in my classes, clubs, and at my job that I really hit it off with. We spend hours together or work entire days together. We make each other laugh. It seems like our interactions flow really well and we seem to get along. However, it seems like I’m incapable of connecting deeper with these people. This is especially clear to me with the way that these people never want to go further with me. I’m never asked for my number/snap. I’m never asked to hang out outside of class/work/etc. I know some people would respond to this with “just be the one to make the plans first” but that’s not my point. I do make plans. And I make a great effort with people. My problem is I’m tired of being the one to ask for numbers or make plans. It makes me feel unloved and unworthy because nobody wants to make the same effort with me that I do with them. And it hurts even more because I know that if I stopped making plans or reaching out to people, nobody would bother with me anymore. I’m so sick of it. \n\nI guess my main question is how do I get past this? How do I turn an acquaintance into a friend? What words or phrases or interactions do I need to have with people to do this? And overall, how do I start getting invites and effort? If anyone has advice please help.",
