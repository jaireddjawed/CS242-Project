        "text": "The Walker and Knight engraving everyone seems to use to represent Ned Ludd shows a man wearing what appears to be women's clothing. I know Ludd himself is not generally thought to be a real person, and in fact the caption on the engraving only identifies its subject as \"the leader of the Luddites,\" but I was curious why the engraver choose to depict him that way. I know women did participate in the Luddite movement, but other than that I found some vague references to male Luddites wearing women's clothing. And I learned that the later Merched Beca sometimes wore women's clothes while destroying toll gates, though I got the impression that was intended more to represent the biblical Rebecca herself, which doesn't seem to have a direct parallel in the Luddites.\n\nSo my question is this: did male Luddites wear women's clothing while protesting or while destroying machinery? If so, why? If not, why are they depicted as doing so in that engraving?",

Besides the two historic Paris teams, almost all championship titles went to south western teams, ans even to this day there’s a much higher concentration of clubs, both pro and amateur in these regions. Comparatively, football seems to have developped relatively evenly in all regions, mostly around working class cities.\nWhy is that?",

        "text": "Ever since the Magna Carta, English Royalty and Aristocracy appears to have been on a long slow slide to irrelevancy. Today royals really only have ceremonial duties and powers; the aristocracy has even less.\n\nAmericans tend to paint King George III as a villain, but how involved was he, really? Most of the other media I've watched or read set during the Napoleonic wars portrays the king as a sort of non-entity sitting above everything while various parliamentary ministers to about the work, but I've also always had the impression that the royal lack of powers is fairly modern thing. I know that George III's madness/illness/incapacity complicates things, presumably his inability to act as king highlighted the powers that people expected the king to exert. But I can't really find much beyond a power to appoint ministers, though even that seems to have been a matter for debate.\n\nSimilarly, how much power did the aristocracy have? At some point they stopped being local rulers and became just rich guys and landlords, so what actual powers beyond lease contracts and access to capital did a duke or earl have? I'd assume that they generally lost governmental powers as the king lost his powers to the Commons, but I have no idea.",

I remember him mentioning gout as a widespread ailment among richer people, but saying that pain from all types of issues was widespread and had an impact on social behaviours. \n\nAs a first year lecture however, he didn't really share his sources, and we never went over that particular fact in our readings. What's the truth to this statement? With a postgrad outlook, the difficulty of proving such a fact is evident, as I don't really see what kind of primary source would be used. \n\nI'd really appreciate if anyone has input on this question, it's been on my mind regularly for half a decade.\n\nThank you!",

Didn't the Romans / Greeks create entire democratic states, senates and governments, the arts, technology like aqueducts, masonry and vast stone structures like the colosseum, complex philosophical thought and early stage scientific discoveries, etc. etc. Over 500 - 1000 years before the Viking age?\n\nBut most of the depictions of the Norse during the 9th century show them in wooden structures and hill forts performing human sacrifice, raiding, pillaging and basically following the ethos of 'the man with the biggest stick will be the king'.

        "text": "Sam Kriss wrote an article attempting to build a timeline of continuous African Utopian myths from Vicindaria to Wakanda. Here's a [Web Archive snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20230221151008/https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-secret-history-of-wakanda), and here's the [current published revision](https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-secret-history-of-wakanda).\n\nI'm here because of a strange inconsistency I saw in a Frantz Fanon quote. This passage is important because the copyright date for Fanon's *Black Skin, White Masks* (1952) predates Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's attributions for Wakanda (1966).\n\nThis is the paragraph leading up to the Fanon quote, going back even farther.\n\n&gt;But the second great Vicinderian revival came from black  Americans. In 1909, the prophet Olumo Bashenga began making speeches in  Chicago, claiming that black Americans were not Negroes, but descendants  of the kings of Vicinder, which he Africanised as Wakanda. In his  mythology, Wakanda was the ancestor of all civilisation, but had hidden  itself away from the world when the colonies it had set up around the  Mediterranean degenerated into ‘white-pig savagery.’ But one day soon,  Wakanda would reveal itself again, topple the United States of America,  exterminate the misbegotten whites, and forge a new global empire.  Bashenga’s network of ‘Royal Embassies of the Kingdom of Wakanda’  quickly spread across the United States and the Caribbean. Many black  intellectuals were unconvinced by the movement: WEB Du Bois dismissed  its Wakandan mythology as ‘unnecessary,’ and Frantz Fanon lands a few  jabs in the final chapter of *Black Skin, White Masks*:\n\nThis is the Fanon quote (my bold):\n\n&gt;It  would be of the greatest interest to be able to have contact with a  **Wakandan** literature or architecture of the third century before Christ. I  should be very happy to know that a correspondence had flourished  between Plato and some **Wakandan** philosopher. But I can absolutely not  see how this fact would change anything in the lives of the  eight-year-old children who labour in the cane fields of Martinique or  Guadeloupe.\n\nI bought *Black Skin, White Masks*, specifically ISBN 978-0-8021-4300-6. I found the passage on page 205. [Here's a photo, linked from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MXmU7Q0WkIF8n30DSxqFRO-RR4ueudLJ/view?usp=share_link). I stripped extra EXIF data for privacy, but kept the original resolution. Compare the bolded words to the photographed paragraph. If you cannot see the photo, it shows that the book says \"black\" where the quote says \"Wakandan.\"\n\nI see two possibilities: 1. Sam edited Fanon's passage. 2. The exact book I purchased differs from the one Sam quoted. I didn't see an ISBN or datum to point me to a translation that rules out #2.\n\nI'm here to seek help finding the source of this inconsistency, and to see if there are others. Out of observance of rule #3, I do not expect all work to be done for me. Rather, I am seeking leads to find more targeted information. Thanks in advance for your review.",

It could be correct obviously, but I have a hard time believing that ancient generals where idiots who couldn't figure out what a flanking maneuver is or how to lay an ambush and lure the enemie force. What was warfare and tactics like in these early stages? Where there advanced tactics and maneuvers and actual usage of different units or did they just charge at each other and call it a day?\n\nThe tweet: \nhttps://twitter.com/shaun_vids/status/1632074632571355139?t=Nc1nmjWX05zHkIXli6iDiw&amp;s=19",

The dictators couldn’t count on as much support from those powers. Yet in North Africa, little appears to have changed. Mubarak was president of Egypt from 1981-2011. Ben Ali was president of Tunis’s from 1987-2011. Gaddafi ruled from the 1970s to 2011.

        "text": "I've read here — perhaps from [u/Iphikrates](https://www.reddit.com/u/Iphikrates/) ?— that Greek citizens didn't train for war during peacetime, although Sparta did have fitness training, ate in military-like groupings, and had the advantage of doing formation drills. Athens apparently had nothing like this.\n\nBut I've been reading Xenophon's Memorabilia. In one of the dialogues, Socrates is talking to a recently-appointed Athenian cavalry commander — two of whom were appointed each year — apparently serving during peacetime. \n\nThis line makes me think it is peacetime, when Socrates is wondering why the commander wanted the job:\n\n&gt;‘Well then, is it because you think that you might hand back cavalry which you have improved to the State, and that if any need for mounted troops should arise you might do our country some service as their commander?’\n\nSince there were no standing troop formations, exactly what was this commander overseeing? Socrates makes is sound like it's the commander's job to be improving the state of the cavalry. But you say there is no cavalry?\n\nAt first the commander says it's not his job to oversee the state of his troop's horses. \n\nBut then Socrates points out that:\n\n&gt;‘suppose that you find some of them turning out their horses with such bad feet or legs, or in such poor condition, or so underfed, that they can’t keep up with the rest, and you find others coming up with horses which are so fresh that they won’t keep their places or are such kickers that you can’t get them into position at all – what will be the good of your cavalry? How will you be able to do your country any service if your troopers are mounted like that?’\n\nAnd then, regarding the riders:\n\n&gt; ‘Well, now, what about the horsemen? Won’t you try to improve their quality?’ ‘  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yes, I will.’   \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘Won’t you begin by making them better at mounting their horses?’  \n&gt;  \n&gt; ‘I ought to, certainly, because then if one of them fell off, his chances of survival would be improved.’   \n&gt;  \n&gt;‘And next, if you have to risk an engagement, will you order them to draw the enemy on to the sandy ground where you are accustomed to exercise, or will you try to carry out your training in the sort of country in which campaigns are fought?’\n\nI realize that Xenophon was a successful general and may be putting words in Socrates's mouth. Maybe it was he, and not Socrates, who thought Athen's cavalry needed more oversight. \n\nBut we're starting from the position of a commander who's been appointed to oversee cavalry. If he had no ability to train over oversee his potential draftees, what is this whole dialogue about? \n\nShould the conversation be about trying to get the assembly to agree to periodic training for the cavalry rather than advising the newly-elected commander —who will have no legal ability to do anything until war is declared — on what he needs to be considering?",

Granted, the accounts of tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of soldiers may be somewhat exaggerated, but given the later Roman army's organization into maniple, century, legion, etc I don't think we have much reason to doubt the later size of armies. \n\nIn the later Medieval period, conflicts appeared to be much smaller, and disunity in the ranks between feuding lords is something that gets mentioned in some of the sources I've read. However, the matter of different lords, knights, and levies leads me to believe that communication to a larger body of men would be made even more difficult, given that there might be no formalized standard of communications except what the leading commander might decree at the outset.\n\nI would imagine that horns, letters, and banners would be a big part of the communication system, but to be honest it's very hard for me to wrap my head around how successfully some of history's more complicated maneuvers would have been executed. I'm in the military, with some of the most advanced communication hardware ever conceived being processed around the world, around the clock, we still manage to fuck up the simplest orders.",

What I have learnt is that primary source from which we learn from Diogenes' life comes from the work of Diogenes Laertius, in the book \"The Lives of Eminent Philosophers\".\n\nGiven Diogenes's status and his unique contribution to Cynicism, I believe there must be other classic sources, that had been written much earlier than Laertius's time, on life and work of Diogenes? Did any philosophers at his time (e.g. Plato, or some Sophist?) wrote or referenced him directly in their work? Did Persian or Egyptian scholar wrote about him? There must be other Cynics who wrote about him, right?\n\nIf there is absolutely no other direct reference to Diogenes other than Laertius's book, then is there any possibility that this philosopher never exist from the first place? Given the lack of credibility and reliability source (as far as I know, modern historians find Laertius's book to be unreliable), I sometime doubt if he was a fictional character or a myth.\n\nIf it's possible, some books suggestion would be so great!

        "text": "I know very little about history.\n\nI remember a while back someone talking about how for a period in the late 1200s and early 1300s, particular scribes added diagrams in the margins of medieval memes, and without a historic Know Your Meme, we don't know what many of them are about. In particular, knights fighting giant snails.\n\nIt's so common, the study of it apparently even has a name, something about escargots, I forget.\n\nIt's agreed that no one knows what it's about, but one of the leading theories is that the snails are Lombard knights that the Italian knights (the ones actually drawn as knights) fight and ridicule.\n\nThat's all I knew, and, here comes the part that rang a bell for me...\n\nI got down this rabbit hole by accident, from learning about private military contractors (PMCs), used by Russia and the US today. Modern day mercenaries. The (fantastic) war economics Youtube channel \"PERUN\" made a pronunciation error in his brief summary of historical uses of mercenaries a couple days ago. In German, they're called: \n\n**\"Landsknecht\", or \"Lands\" (land) + \"knecht\" (knight / servant).** \"Knight/Servant of the Land\" = Mercenary. This was a term of pride, unlike how others saw it as derogatory.\n\nSimple enough. But he pronounced it as: \n\n**\"Landschnecke\", moving the 's' to the second word, and creating \"Land\" (land) + \"schnecke\" (snail). \"Land Snail\".** Which, isn't really a word or a term, but, that's what he'd pronounced it as.\n\nSo in particular when referring to German Mercenaries (Lombards) who had invaded and were a subject of ridicule to the Italians, with an Italian pronunciation (?), the translation becomes \"Land Snails\", and thus, all these Italian knights (or whoever, as Italy wasn't a country) fighting off giant German (Lombardian, as Germany wasn't a country) Land Snails. It's a pun. This is too coincidental for me to believe otherwise without at least asking.\n\nProblems with the theory: I think the term Landsknecht existed until the 1400s maybe? Or is that maybe only in German? Or, could it be a pun from some other time or earlier language and the wordplay is still valid?\n\nOr... is this something everyone already knows and has dismissed and you're irritated with some history know-nothing like me keeps thinking they've come up with something new?\n\nAnyway, thought it humorously coincidental and worth a question.",

It's my understanding that the traditional traits associated with Aryans were essentially Nordic traits (blonde hair, blue eyes, tall, slim but muscular, etc.). But, while I'm sure plenty of Germans at the time did have these traits, it obviously wasn't all of them. Many top leaders, as shown in that propaganda poster, didn't have these traits. So why would they idealize a description that didn't include so many of them?",

Or would it be more realistic to seek the French lands to be recognized as part of England proper?",

I’ve noticed in my search for PhD programs that no universities offer a concentration in Australian history while almost all other major continents are represented in some capacity. \n\nFurthermore, I asked Australian Redditors on r/AskReddit a few months about famous Australians in their history that are generally loved. The only responses I received were they that don’t “deify” their leaders. I asked because outside of John Curtain I couldn’t think of a famous Australian.\n\nCan anyone explain why this could be?\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "So I had been exploring the city of Pittsburgh and sort of its postwar 'flux,' where the city underwent multiple projects that changed the landscape of the city quite a bit, for a personal project. Specifically, I was investigating the Gateway Centers, their construction, how they were constructed, and what they took down to put them up. While trying to come up with all of this, I found pictures by Elliott Erwitt, at first, and then some other photos, all showing the same thing, borders of construction areas being lined by what look like doors? And clearly doors that have been up long enough that people would think to advertise movies on them. I've tried to look up anything relating doors to construction sites as something like fences, but all that's come up is just a bunch of news articles on the idolization of \"old homes.\" This is basically my last ditch effort to see if there's anything interesting about this, or if it's just a random, one-off thing.   \n\n\nJudging from the movie posters for \"No Way Out\" and \"The Sleeping City,\" I'll have to assume that these posters went up in early October, 1950, Pittsburgh, which should date the time period pretty precisely.  \n\n\n[Here's that photo.](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2017/aug/08/city-flux-pittsburgh-1950-elliott-erwitt-in-pictures#img-3)  \n\n\n[And here's a second photo which looks either like doors, or planks of wood up against the building, in the center right of the photo.](https://historicpittsburgh.org/islandora/object/pitt%3AMSP285.B003.F02.I05/viewer)",
