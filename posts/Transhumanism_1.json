        "text": "Generational change is one of the largest drivers of social progress. Socially conservative older people rarely change their views, and instead, they eventually die while their more socially progressive children take their place. \n\nPeople tend to set their views early in life and stick with them for the long haul. Social views can evolve somewhat, but core beliefs and values tend to be deeply entrenched. \n\nRegularly forcing yourself to re-evaluate your views, and update them when you realize you were wrong about something, is hard. Some people do that, and those people are awesome. I commend them. But they aren't the majority. Staying in your comfort zone will always be the more comfortable option compared to deep self-reflection. \n\nBut if we want social progress to continue, which I hope we do, then we as people who intend not to die must regularly self-reflect in order to drive progress ourselves instead of waiting for our offspring to do it for us. My worry is that this won't be the norm, and people will get stuck in their views for centuries upon centuries, causing progress to stagnate. \n\nWhat can we do to make sure that doesn't happen?",

I think it would not happen, and at least in the near future they would be vastly more capable of everything then humanity, so in a sense humanity would be obsolete, but would still serve humanity, making the need for humans to catch up with AI irrelevant.

        "text": "When our ancestors evolved human intelligence, they passed a singularity relative to other animals. Although they seem incredibly mundane to us, episodic memory/ autonoetic- consciousness and abstract language and thinking are incredibly powerful abilities. We now think in ways completely incomprehensible to other animals. In a sense, we are \"post-animals\" as our abilities have allowed us to transcend the animalistic condition. \n\nThe question on my mind is when will we pass the next singularity and what incredibly abilities might this jump give us? One way of measuring the intelligence of a being is by looking at the complexity of systems it can design and control. Humans can design systems orders of magnitude more complex than even the smartest animals and thus its reasonable to assume, that beings that have passed the next singularity may be able to design and control systems orders of magnitude more complex than what we humans can. What I think this will look like is absolute mastery of matter on the nano-scale. These beings may be able to design machines *equal in complexity to natural life*. Things like utility fog, smart matter, fractal bush-bots, nano robots, nano-factories, neo-gen life forms and eco-system management down to the nanoscale all may be possible. \n\nNow this is all purely speculation but I think that some very smart humans already may have had glimpses into the next \"singularity.\" Just like how I imagine many of our early ape ancestors often had strange flashes of human like thought I think some genius humans occasionally have moments of post-singularity thought. \n\nMy theory is that these flashes of human brilliance most often manifest in an integrated sense of self: a state of consciousness, where seemingly contradictory concepts like self, the universe, life and death all are somehow understood as simultaneously true. Practically this doesn't actually mean much of anything as the human brain isn't actually capable of applying this type of thought to anything scientific or practical. Its just like how a monkey with a human like identity will still never understand calculus.\n\nNow what I'm not saying is that  meditating is the key to solving quantum gravity or any such new age bs. I think that the human brain is not optimized for this level of cognition and that such abilities would likely never evolve naturally. In fact I doubt biological substrates would be ideal. To achieve such feats of intellection we will probably need to design substrates beyond the Neumann architecture and even natural brains. AI and mind uploading is probably the best path. \n\nAnyways, this is just my perspective on the singularity.",

        "text": "Hello r/transhumanism, I've recently (as in today) started the sub r/MachineCult, which is a migration of the older r/CultMechanicus. This migration took place for two main reasons:\n\n1. Concerns over copyright and trademark laws regarding usage of icons and language from Games Workshop\n2. Wanting to make the faith more than just a word-for-word copy of the Cult Mechanicus\n\nThe Machine Cult are transhumanist in our beliefs, namely cybernetically transhumanist, believing that a transition from biological to mechanical life is the best path forward for humanity. Our beliefs are better explained on both subreddits, as well as merely by reading about the Cult Mechanicus from 40k. \n\nI'm posting here to ask that any who are interested join the sub and help put together the faith, adapting 40k lore as well as other transhumanist ideals into doctrine, and for criticism of any writings I've put together so far, and of our beliefs in general. The sub is also open for anyone who wants to ask questions there rather than here, as well as for Warhammer fans who may just want to post memes or other pictures.\n\nIf you have any questions, any at all, please feel free to ask. Have a nice day!",

Why was I targeted by police and the public? I‚Äôve learned so much but still am in the dark. \n\nWith this ability and my mind‚Äôs data that others have captured, I know my impact has been massive.

It makes me sick, it gave my dog cancer. They speak to my mind, inside my head, and through very discreet audio in my home. I‚Äôve even recorded them speaking, and my own inner voice speaking back through the speakers, so I know it‚Äôs technology driven. There‚Äôs near perfect transmission of my discrete thoughts to other people, I want to know how. ‚ÄúWant‚Äù is a dirty word to them, they want me subjugated for the rest of my life. \n\nMy entire neighborhood of Hell‚Äôs Kitchen where I live is outfitted with speakers that play the voices of people I used to know taunting me. 24/7, people work in shifts to make sure I‚Äôm constantly engaged, but not liberated. \n\nDoes anyone have info they can share about this? Who people say I am, and where I‚Äôm talked about would be incredible. How they connect to my mind and whatever else would be divine.",
