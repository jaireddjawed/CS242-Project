        "text": "Hello,\n\nBringing this here for some opinions. My husband and I recently took the historical tour at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, CO. As always on a tour in a haunted area, the tour guide was animate that we take multiple pictures in row to capture any discrepancies that may be a \"spirit.\" We are always a little skeptical but love to play along hoping that we do in fact find something mysterious. This time around, we definitely feel like we caught something. The first picture I am posting is of the other side of the wall (NO GHOSTS) but shows you what is reflecting on to the other side of the wall (Next picture WITH ghost - posted twice, with ghost circled).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[First wall, no ghost - but you can see what is reflecting](https://preview.redd.it/5jsgnyh6lkma1.jpg?width=810&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ef993a40bf1ea61fcf1755269a8d12d532d5fc00)\n\n[Wall with ghost](https://preview.redd.it/bfq8fjqzkkma1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=687b18faa0822a4699a37a5ddfe15b80f223d895)\n\n[Ghost circled](https://preview.redd.it/zgz6zjqzkkma1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=380f52ada5716f511484f6ba68dbf6495ed03d15)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Better quality, up close](https://preview.redd.it/cxuhqp65tkma1.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3484776d672cfb8596d88163b2de5ffcc6a8157f)\n\nThis is a mirror reflecting in a mirror, and weirdly enough, the employee running the seance's at the hotel posted a week earlier on The Stanley Hotel FB page that they were having a lot of success with paranormal activity in mirrors reflecting in mirrors. I am posting here to see if we aren't (or are) crazy. \\*You may need to zoom in for details\\* The \"cowboy hat\" looking object towards the top of the mirror is what keeps me coming back....Let me know what you think.",

        "text": "Bonjour, je suis nouvelle et je vais vous racontez mon histoire. Tout commence l'année dernière, au décès de mon grand-père, quand on me l'a annoncé, on aurait dit que quelqu'un ou quelque chose bloqué mes larmes. Comme si il y a avait sa présence.\n\nJ'entendais des grattements à ma porte de chambre que mes sœurs n'entendait pas (on est dans la même chambre), je pouvais aussi entendre des pas qui marchait doucement comme une personne âgée, et des toquzmznts à la fenêtre, je pouvais aussi sentir une présence à côté de moi quand je dormais, et un souffle chaud ou froid sur ma nuque la nuit. Quelques fois je voyais une ombre passée puis repartir à travers ma chambre.\n\nIl n'y pas longtemps, la mamie de ma petite cousine est tristement décédée donc elle était venu dormir aujourd'hui et le week-end précédent. On s'amusait, on riait, enfin bref tout allait bien, ma petite cousine a 8 ans en ce moment et elle m'avoir sentir la présence de quelqu'un qui la suit partout.\n\nÀ cause du décès de sa mamie, je me dit qu'elle halucine et qu'elle est peut-être traumatisée à cause de ça donc rien d'alarmant jusqu'à ce qu'elle me dise voir une ombre en face d'elle, je lui explique donc qu'il n'y a rien et que elle voit peut-être l'ombre du lit de ma sœur, et que c'est rien. Elle m'explique donc que depuis le décès de sa grand-mère elle voit apparaître une ombre noir, fine, sans silhouette. Elle me dit aussi qu'elle entend aussi des pas, puis des os qui frotte, comme sa mamie car elle est décédé à l'hôpital, la peau sur les os. \n\nÇa ressemble beaucoup à ce que j'ai vécu aussi, et depuis je rentends les mêmes bruits d'il y a un an, et ma petite sœur aussi mais pour la première fois de sa vie. On a 3 trois hypothèse avec ma sœur:\n1:Soit c'est sa mamie qui vient lui dire au revoir et la protéger de tout danger\n2:Peut-être sa mamie qui veille sur elle sans même la protéger \n3:Un esprit mal sains qui lui veut du mal.\n\nSVP Partagez et commentez pour avoir quelques réponses à nos questions car là c'est paranormal, et si il vous est arrivé quelque chose de similaire prévenez moi, merci.\n\nAu Revoir",

        "text": "This is an experience I had a few years ago which made me believe in the paranomal and I hope you find it as interesting and creepy as I did. English as second language so I'll try my best.\nSo I went out a very early morning around 5 am to take photos in the forrest since I have always liked the \"vibe\" of the forrest, especially during mornings since it has a kind of calmness to it. I live in central sweden where we have many deep forrests everywhere where much of it is \"untouched\", think plenty of moss and old trees. This particular forrest I went to was quite near my home, however since I lived on the countryside I was very alone with no other soul around.\nDuring this morning there was also fog lingering in the treetops from the surrounding rivers which looked really cool to be honest so I was soo ready to take some cool photos.\n\nI went into the forrest after parking my car along the road that went beside it and started walking straight in. After maybe 100 meters I stopped to take some photos, mostly of dead trees and mushrooms and things like that(I was 20 and felt very artsy). After a few minutes I started hearing knocks on trees. Probably a bird I thought since we have woodpeckers around here so hearing that wasnt unusual. The strange thing is that I started looking for it since it came from a tree that was right beside me but could not find it. Unlucky I thought, I wanted to see if I could get a nice photo but I decided to move on. \n\nI continued walking into the forrest when I noticed something. The knocking or pecking seemed to follow me as I walked. It continiously knocked on trees close to me. At this point I didnt think too much about it, however that would change after a while. I stopped at a spot that looked really nice to setup my camera on a tripod in an attempt to maybe snap some cool photos of the surrounding area and treetops. I sat down and continued to hear the knocking on a tree just a few meters behind me. At this point I started to feel a little weird since I had really noticed how it seemed to follow me. A few second later while changing my camera settings I suddenly heard several very loud, clear and heavy footseps behind me that rapidly came closer and closer until it was right behind me,  my whole body frose. I have not til this day experienced chills like that through my entire body. After what felt like several second I flew up and turned to what I thought was some kind of big animal, but nothing was there.  For context beside a few trees this area was not dense. Just a few trees here and there but mostly moss and grass. \n\nI picked up all my things and started walking really fast back towards my car and thats when the knocking started again. It followed me again and I just knew something was \"mocking\" me so I even said out loud \"yes I am leaving\". I knew that whatever it was it did not want me there. I continued to hear the knocking until I came back to the spot where I first started hearing it and it just stopped. I did not. I went straight back to my car and went home. \n\nBefore this I was sceptical to the paranormal but it really changed my views. Since then I have only had one more experience but this is the one that really scared me.",

        "text": "When I was 12 I had a friend, his name was Jay. He was 14. He was my cousins good friend, i was just starting to become good friends when this started.\n\nHe was an eccentric person. He was very into medieval times and would talk like them sometimes. Because of that he didn't have many friends. I didn't mind, I found him funny. He was also huge into botany. He would often go into the woods to study plants. Finding edible ones and non edible ones.\n\nI went with him a few times. Every single time, he would have his dog. It was a jack Russell terrier. He also always wore a specific orange hoodie with his last name on it. \n\nJust a bit info on him. I remember the night before, I could've sworn I heard ambulances rushing near by. The day of, I was supposed to go to my cousins house. I was about a 25 min walk or a 10 min bike ride. There was a clearing with a very small entry to the woods Jay liked using on the way there. \n\nWhen I'm about 50 yds away, I see him and orange sweater and his dog walking into the entry. I yelled his name but he never looked up. I eventually got to the opening and again saw him and yelled his name. He never turned and kept walking. Not even his dog and that dog loved me.\n\nI was going to follow him but felt lazy so I went straight to my cousins house. When I get there, he wasn't home and his step dad opens the door. He tells my cousin isn't home and breaks the news that Jay was in an accident.\n\n Apparently he was coming back from being in the woods later than usual and was hit by a drunk driver on his way home. He didn't die immediately but died a few hrs later from his injuries. His dog died immediately. \n\nI called my cousin and he confirmed it. I was shocked and never told anyone what I saw. I always kept that doubt with me. He lived with his grandmother and I'll never forget her at the funeral. I miss that kid.. he never bothered anyone and everyone left him alone while he did his botany stuff.",

        "text": "As a result from a personal experience. I've spent the last 5 years trying to make ties between Science and Religion, and to keep this short, I belive the true story is somewhere in the middle. The agendas pushed by the Elites and the recent events have only convinced me further that we are under a spiritual war. \n\nIf you have done any research on things the Elite Spheres within the US Government, you know there is a lot of Satanistic bullshit. Those are the same people that have kept knowledge about UAP and alien contact to themselves. I don't think any of this is a coincidence, and I think they will try something big soon (given all the recent disclosure, programming us into accepting the future).\n\nI don't think the \"aliens\" that visit us and are keptna secret by the Elites are innocent little creatures that came to enlighten us. I always had the feeling these could be multi-dimensional beings that want something from us, and they are getting it through the Highest Power Sphere in the West.\n\nNow, I needed something that could actually tie the aliens to a spiritual purpose, and... I saw the Documentary  \"Moment of Contact\", which dives deep into the UFO crash and Alien capture in Varginha, Brasil.\n\nSome things about that film blew my mind:\n\n1) If there is one  thing all the actual witnesses agreed on was the Stink of sulfure/ammoniac wherever these Aliens were and even the ship itself. The smell remained for weeks. Some people say it could be Ozone, but I will explain why I don't think it is further down⬇️.\n\n2) The one person they knew thay had engaged in physical unprotected contact with one of the aliens died shortly after the capture. They couldn't declare a Cause Of Death because the real answer would give credibility to what actually happened. The man's immune system was shut down suddenly and he was gone.\n\n3) The illustrations of the aliens according to witness description is insane. They are  brownish, slimy, sulfure/ammoniac stinking little creatures with huge red eyes and  something like three horns in their head.\n\n4) James Fox later said that the Doctors that were checking the aliens said they telepathically communicated with them, and said we didn't know who we really were, that we didn't need hospitals to cure diseases/injuries and that we were unplugged from spirituality.\n\nAm I too far gone? or does this actually add up to think these may be the negative entities we've heard so much about and that's why they are so interested in us?",

        "text": "Good day! I’d like to share some of the experiences I’ve had with animals. I don’t have anyone personally that’d be interested in the stories I have to share. Insight is appreciated but not expected. \n\n1.)\nGrowing up we always lived remotely. I loved sitting quietly observing the hubbub of all the creatures big and small. So, it wasn’t out of the ordinary for me to spend my bath time quietly washing with the bathroom window open so I could hear the birds outside. This sets the scene for my first story. 20+ years ago and it’s still fresh in my mind. A soft canine whimper. Maybe it was just preteen whimsy but the sound filled me with dread. I carefully crept from the bath to peer out the window. I wasn’t able to see anything but in my minds eye I’ve always seen an elderly lab. We did have a little dog at the time but I knew her voice well and our cat never went outside. \n\n2.)\nThe cat I previously mentioned was hurt as a kitten he’d sustained a head injury that impaired his motor skills. The vet referred to him as a swimmer. Mack was his name and by all other accounts he was a normal large grey tabby. Mack and I were inseparable and he slept with me nightly. The only time I saw Mack be anything other than gentle was in the middle of one particular night. It was the only such instance I witnessed. Mack was between me and the wall hunched down, back arched and hair standing straight snarling. It was a desperate noise, completely out of character and it was frankly terrifying. Mack quieted the moment I spoke and I never saw the behavior again. \n\n3.)\nDuring the winter I had gone outside to play in the snow. We were in the middle of a substantial snowstorm, but we we’re accustomed to such things. I had wander quite a ways from the house into a farmer’s field. The viability was less than a 1/4 of a mile. Out there I saw a number of abnormally large coyotes running in a large circle.  Through the snow I could see them just well enough to know what they were. It didn’t feel real but it scared me nonetheless I hightailed it home. \n\n4.)\nFinally, before I wear out my welcome. During my second pregnancy. I caught a glimpse of what I believe was what could be a spirit dog. It was a small red dog with erect triangular ears much like a kelpie. The first time I saw it it was standing in the door way of my son’s nursery. It was only there for a couple of seconds but it felt like a lifetime.",

        "text": "\nBefore I go into this story, I want to preface that everything I’m telling you is 100% no bullshit. There is enough fake story’s on here. \n\nThis happened to me in my early teens. (I’m 21 now)\nMy best friend growing up had this huge farm house in the middle of Virginia. It was VERY OLD and beautiful but also had a very dark history. In the house, there is a tunnel that lead to a underground room of sorts that was used for slaves to hide in 1800’s. And I’m 90% sure that some died down there while in hiding. So you can imagine the history and energy that fills the house. \n\nI always felt scared there. I never felt alone and wouldn’t go anywhere alone in the house, even just to grab something out of my room. Even the family was scared to stay there with no company because of the intense apparitions and experiences which I can get into another day. The rooms where massive and the entire house was white with honestly creepy vintage decor. There was even a cabinet of FUCKING Ventriloquist dolls upstairs. No joke. \n\nThey where a really odd family honestly with lots of dark problems. Anyways, The second time I visited that house I was with my mom, my best friend at the time and her mom. It was a girls trip. One night I woke up and was so thirsty and the last thing I wanted to fucking do was go down stairs and get water. I was terrified I hated that house at night but my mom was dead asleep so I Literally sprinted downstairs with my head only looking at the floor.\n\n I made my water in 5 seconds and when I made it too the stairs something compelled me to look at the GIANT glass doors that where in front of the stairs.  I was horrified but felt like I needed to look out the window. What I saw when I looked that window will haunt me for the rest of my life. I saw a man, as real as anything I’ve ever seen. \n\nIt was pitch black outside with a huge bright moon. The man was all black ( like a silhouette) but because of the moon being so bright  I could clearly see his entire body. He was blacker than black like he stood out so much I 100% thought he was a trespasser. He was wearing a top hat and was un-humanly tall. Like 7 feet. My heart Litterally felt like it stopped beating. I felt like I was in a trace. I was so unexplainably horrified but I couldn’t look away. He was moving a little bit, almost like breathing. Then about 10 seconds later, he was gone. Disappearing into thin air. I fucking panicked and bolted Upstairs after I snapped out of my trance. I cried to my mom and was up all night. \n\nThe next morning I told my friend and her mom about the experience and they where not shocked at all. As they had seen multiple full body apparitions in the house themselves. The nanny that worked for them even refused to go into some rooms of the house. I never went back to that house again.",

        "text": "This is a little hard to explain, but I'll do my best. All my life I have been able to see something like \"rainbow static\" overlaying everything, or at least as long as I can remember. It's very VERY hard to see, but if I stop and stare it's always there.\n\nIt is harder to see if I'm looking at a colourful or textured surface, but white surfaces are where I first noticed it. At first I thought it was light refraction on a tiny scale or something, but it's visible in pitch black as well. It is EASIEST to see when I have my eyes closed, but doing so affects the viewing quality of any shapes or patterns I can see (more on that shortly). The colours look kinda similar to what you would see if you pressed your eyeballs, but much more static-like, and BARELY visible.\n\nI have seen things in it before, on one occasion before collapsing on the floor I saw the \"pixels\" get larger like I was zooming in (they kinda look liked rainbow skin cells without a nucleus that time). Another time I saw a something like a rainbow Chinese dragon in it very clearly, looking at me as if inspecting some kind of troublemaker. (A lot of it's scales were gold but it had other colours which looked like gemstones or something, there is actually some passages on the OT which describe an entity that sounds very similar, referred to by one of the prophets as the \"King of Tyre\".\n\nI have also noticed that some people and objects have what looks like a \"field\" around them.\n\nWhen it's people, it isn't always easy to see, sometimes the field seems to follow the shape of their bodies, other times I only catch a glimpse of it and it looks to be centred around their head.\n\nJust earlier before I made this post I was seeing movement in it and while laying here in the dark I noticed that it had an extremely tumultuous pattern to it. It looked similar to what I imagine the inside of a star would look like, or a fire, or raging water, or the inside of a cloud if you could see the air waves. Or, kinda like the foam you see when waves crash against the shore.\n\nAdditionally, this calmed a bit and the pattern began to resemble the Aurora Borealis in how it flowed and ebbed just like one, and seemed to go straight through the walls in my room.\n\nI am wondering if anyone else has experienced this at all? Or something similar? \n\nBefore anyone tells me to go see a psychiatrist to check for schizophrenia, I don't have it. Already checked, and have observed it in another person personally and can tell the difference between it and whatever this is.\n\nOh I can also see something that looks vaguely like a blurry field around magnets, it's nearly totally invisible but it is there. Note that none of this has ever obstructed my view of a physical object.",

        "text": " \n\nhello, this might seem like some kind of a creepypaste, or a made up story, but ill leave it up for you to decide.)  \n\n\nI have also posted this under a different community, a ufo one to be exact. I think it should be posted here as well, enjoy.\n\nThis all started around 24 years ago, When my mother was pregnant with my sister, my sister died in the pregnancy, I never got told which month it was in, but it was in the middle of the pregnancy. The doctor said she is dead, and that there is nothing they can do. My mother is very paranormal, connected to certain energies stuff based, she used to do a lot of \"Magic\" back in the days when she was younger, and I dont mean the kind of harry poter Magic, I mean the actual magic that connects this world, the energies. As that happened, my mother was very devasteted, and she did not know what to do. Later at that point, she had a dream where a lot of big, white, thin figures visited her in her dream. She explained that she did not fear them, a good energy came out of them, she said, and they said something on the kind, its okay, dont worry about the child. Somehow, my sister was born, healty, alive, and very smart. Even the doctors did not know what happened, and how its even possible. that was that. She knew how to speak, walk, and do common actions in a brutal early age in her life. (way too ealier then within other children.) My parents just thought she was very smart, and that its all okay. Most likely, my mom knew what happened with the dream, and combined it together, but I suppose she never let it out. After a few years, my parents decided to take a trip to a place in my country, we call it Duchonka. We have grandparents there, so it was a known place for my mother. She told me that they were on a bridge, the main one connecting the area, and that they let off my brother, cousin, and my sister to the swings, all was going great, suddenly, the area got very dark, the sun, light, it was all gone. A sudden feeling of depression came. Suddenly, they all saw a unexplained flying ship, they do not remember what it looked like, but they knew it was a ufo. Everyone around started panicking, my mother and father quickly ran to grab off my brother, sister, and cousin off the swings, my mother remembers something about the ufo trying to target my sister, and that is all she remembers. I talked about this with my brother, he remembers it exactly, but he said hes not willing to speak about it, same with my cousin, and same with my father. but my sister does not. It nearly feels like their minds were cleared, and they do not remember on purpose. My mother believe my sister was switched, and that whatever lived with us , was not our sister, and her child.\n\nI would like to add, that I may be missing a few information from the story, because I only know this from very distant memories my mother has , she doesnt remember the details, and such, and this is collected from the whole family by very small pieces. I am 15, and my mother talked about it a few times with me, on long nights, but she always told me in small pieces. No one is willing to talk about it openly, they remember, they know, but they cant get the details out. If anyone would like to talk about me with this in more detail, please, do so. you can reply to me here, or on my discord, If you have anymore questions, ill try to discuss with my mother. thank you for listening, and its up to you if you wanna trust my story or not. have a great night.",

I also want to say that my uncles house was built around the 1920s. So now for the story. As I was getting dressed that morning, in the guest room, the door to the attic started shaking back and forth. Like the handle didn’t jiggle or anything so at the time i just wrote it off as a draft. But, just in case i took my phone off the nightstand which was next to my wallet and booked it downstairs. Now remember how i said my wallet was next to my phone on the nightstand. Now after i came downstairs, i didnt tell anyone about the door because i didnt want to seem crazy. So my brother came went up to that room to get dressed after me. A few mins later he came down with my wallet and handed it to me and said, “hey, this was on the floor”. My heart kinda sank because i knew there was ZERO WAY this thing could’ve naturally moved from where i had it. What does this mean? Was this a paranormal encounter or am i just going crazy? Sorry if this isnt some cool epic story but its the honest truth and im honestly just still baffled from it.",

I’m trying to get my Mother in law to send my the paperwork or at least a copy.

As soon as I get the documents sent to me I’ll give you guys an update!! Have a great night!!",

We’ve been trying for a baby again for 8 months now and I’ve been feeling down because my soon to be SIL is pregnant(I’m very happy and excited for them just saddened that I’m not also pregnant yet). Every month I get so excited and take a test and feel down. Well over the last month I’ve began to see the following angel numbers repeatedly: 111, 222, 333, 444, and 117. I’ve been feeling much healthier and stopped obsessing over getting pregnant but I’ve been still having dreams of it. Last week I was asleep and in my dream I was breastfeeding a baby girl. I suddenly was jolted awake but right before in my dream the angel number 333 flashed repeatedly as soon as I woke up all I could here was a little girls voice calling out to me saying mommy. I sat up and after waking up fully I heard her say it a few more times and what sounded like her trying to enter my room. Then as the door knob moved she stopped. What does this mean? I took a pregnancy test and it’s negative but I have seen 333, 111, and 117 multiple times since this happening. My SILs both were talking to me after this happened about what we’ll do for my baby shower and the maternity pictures we will take. They didn’t know my fiancé and I are trying to conceive and they also aren’t aware of this experience. What do you guys think this means? What should I do?",

        "text": "Just for some background, I have always enjoyed paranormal content but have never believed in ghosts. I have had my fair share of odd experiences but nothing crazy enough that there could not be a rational explanation but this one I cannot explain. \n\nAlright to set the scene, I was on vacation with my family and my girlfriend at the time. Due to a shortage of beds my girlfriend, my brother, and I were staying in a smaller house separated from the big house where the rest of the family were staying. The door to this smaller house had a lock that could be opened by typing a long code into the keypad, this is important later.  My girlfriend and I were sharing a room and my brother was in his own room across the hall. Both of these bedrooms were on the second floor of this smaller house. All of us had taken off our shoes and placed them on one of those rubber shoe mats that was by the door downstairs.\n\nOkay now the event, this was a few days into the trip and everything was going very normal and I never had a bad feeling about the house. I had locked the door to our bedroom before going to bed for self explanitory reasons. After I fell asleep, I had this weird dream where I kept feeling water drip onto my forehead. It was so vivid that when I woke up I checked my head and pillow and told my girlfriend about it. Nothing was wet and we just brushed it off and get dressed. When we go to leave the door to the room is still locked, we go downstairs and go to put our shoes on to walk to the other house. When I pick up my shoes, they're soaking wet. I immediately ask my girlfriend to feel them to make sure I'm not going crazy and then run upstairs to have my brother feel them. My brothers and girlfriends shoes that were on the same mat were completely dry. \n\nThe most obvious theory is sleep walking, this house was a short walk from a lake but it was down a large forested hill. I would have had to get up, unlock my bedroom door, go downstairs, put on my shoes, open the door, walk through the dark woods in the middle of the night, dip my shoes in the lake, and then come all the way back up without waking up. I also would need to have left the door to the house open because if not I would have had to type in the keycode while asleep. On top of this my girlfriend is a very light sleeper and she would have had to not woken up when I left or got back into bed. I was also sleeping naked and the weather was relatively chilly. \n\nPlease let me know if you want any more info or have any explanations, I know it doesn't seem like a huge deal but I have never been this stumped about an experience.",

One night, about a week before Thanksgiving, my buddy Nick called me at like 3am and woke me up out of my sleep. He seemed very distressed and scared, and with a quivering voice told me that he just has the most lucid and freaky dream he had ever had. He told me in his dream that him, my girlfriend at the time, and I were all in a car, turning right onto the road right across the street from our high-school we attended. He said as he turned, a huge truck ran the red light, his car, and killed all 3 of us. I thought it was really weird that he was calling me in the middle of the night to tell me, so I told him to calm down, and go back to bed. \n\nFast forward one week, and my buddy Nick and I were over at our friend Dan's house for a lil Friendsgiving dinner, and because we wanted to chill with friends. Dan's dad was a raging drunk and would start fights with us sometime, and for some reason that was my day to deal with him. Instead of engaging, I asked Nick if he could just give me a ride to my girlfriends house. We went to pick up my Gf, and hang out by our school. As he was preparing to turn right, the light turned green giving us the signal to turn. As he is pressing on the gas to turn he gets a weird feeling, looks to his left, and SLAMS on the brakes. A giant ass Ford F-350 went flying thru the red light, and narrowly missed our car by maybe 6-12 inches at most. Had he gone a little farther, we would have all been dead (he drove a small lil rice burner race car at the time)... Needless to say, him and I were both SHOOK by the experience and he explained that that was EXACTLY what had happened in his dream a week before.\n\nAs the Cherokee used to say, \"Dreams are today's answers to tomorrow's questions.\" \n\nThank God for whatever Guardian Angel had our back that night, cuz I wouldn't be here today to tell this story. Still gives me goosebumps anytime I talk about it.",

I parked a few feet from the door, went inside, got my stuff, and headed for the door. \n\nOn the way out, I saw a young 20ish looking dude standing outside. He had a huge grin on his face and looked high.  I paid him no mind as I started walking to my car. He looks at me, still smiling and says \"Jesus loves you, sir\". I didn't respond, I wanted to avoid the interaction altogether.  When I didn't respond, he says \"Do you know God?\"  At this point, I'm at my car and I open the door, ready to lock it and drive off. \n\nKeep in mind, this guy didn't move throughout this exchange, he stood in place asking me these questions.  As I got in my car and locked the door, I looked out my window expecting to see him still standing there. I wanted to make sure he didn't approach and wasn't going to be in my way as I left.  When I looked out the window, he was gone.  I looked back to the door of the vape shop, it didn't look like it had been opened since I left, as it was a heavy slow closing door. I scanned the parking lot of Walmart and saw no one. \n\n So out of nowhere, this random guy completely vanished.. after a very odd encounter.  \n\nI have no idea what to think of this.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/11l4iqu/my_incredibly_basic_unexplained_moment_in_theater/",
        "text": "Hello all in r/Paranormal!\n\nI’ve seen a lot of posts on here with some incredible stories. Stuff related to lost loved ones, potential demons, and absolutely bizarre circumstances that are unexplainable. As a skeptic who loves the subject, I realized today that I had one really small story I can share on here that I still have a hard time explaining. \n\nFor a few years I worked my way up at a local movie theater that I passionately loved. I was made management really quickly (the bare minimum amount of time I could be) and there were a lot of new responsibilities with it. I spent many late nights alone in the projection booth, which was a long dark hallway to our 16 screen theater. And at night, around 1-3 am depending on last show and closing progress, one of the last things to do was go up there and power everything down. And let me tell you, it was absolutely prime material for spookiness. All lights out, with just the bare lights of the theaters coming through the projection windows (lights are on at night in theaters for the cleaning crew) and…\n\n\nNothing. Nope, not even one time did anything remotely interesting happen up there. I thought it was just FANTASTIC atmosphere for a spooky moment. But nope, just a cool quiet peaceful dark place. \n\nSeveral times I thought about how wild it was to be alone throughout the theater late at night. As a horror/paranormal fan I always thought it would have been a perfect setting. And nothing ever happened really. Until one morning in Theater 15.\n\nOne of my other jobs when I didn’t work late was the opposite end of the spectrum, it was opening. So I got in about an hour and a half before first show starts, went upstairs to power booth, prep our imax projectors, go downstairs and get candy/concession displays out, make sure tills are ready, make sure everyone is arriving on time, and complete my walkthrough before doors unlocked a half hour before first show. It was a lot, but you get a routine and usually I was able to complete the full theater walkthrough before doors unlocked. \n\nOn busier days, we would have a manager to help open. And today was one of those days. So close to doors unlocking, i’m scrambling to finish the walkthrough. Theater 15 is one of our bigger theaters. So on a walkthrough we check lights, ceiling tiles, chairs (especially our list of broken ones to make sure they haven’t been fixed yet), and overall smell and trash etc to see how the cleaning crew did. \n\nSo I make my way to the theater, the pre-show music is playing (so booth has been taken care of and the audio sounds good) and I make my way to the top row to work my way down inspecting the theater. As i’m standing on the top row, I hear distinct heavy boot steps running quickly, coming from right at the screen on the front row. This was not a creek, or a pop, or even a single thud. This was heavy footsteps, on our hardwood flooring, dashing from the side I was on to the to the opposite side right underneath the screen.\n\nMy first thought wasn’t even like “this is the ghost moment!” I knew that the back of that screen is an alley, and it shares the alley with a restaurant. So at first I thought maybe the sound came from outside? Because we do have an exit door right there where the sound started from. So I go back down to see if I hear more noise from outside, and as soon as I got down there, in the row I was standing in, I hear even louder footsteps sprint straight across the row to where I was standing. I’m now in the middle of these two instances, and going “Huh.. okay, no way.” So I ran back up the stairs, and got right up to the top row. Our theater has reclining seats, so half of the seats are now empty and extended areas for the chairs to recline. I check behind the top row where we have some extra floor space. Nobody can hide UNDER the chairs, it’s all wiring and electronics for the seats (i’ve had to fix them several times when something comes loose). And I know that it definitely sounded like the original dash was inside, but it just seemed more likely it was noise from the alley. So last ditch effort to explain this moment: I thought maybe someone was in the alley, and somebody was upstairs in booth. “Hey management, is anyone in booth near 15?” I ask. “No, we’re in the office. Do you need someone up there?” My coworker asks (the GM was also there today doing scheduling). \n\nSo I get doors unlocked, get back to the office, tell them my tale about how I tried to debunk it, and to this day they tell new hires about “the ghost in 15”. \n\nDo I think it? Nah, not enough has happened consistently or to really anyone else for me to say it could be something more than a super weird moment. But that being said, and one of the only “paranormal” moments I have ever experienced, I can’t explain it. \n\nThanks for letting me share a fun story from my time working there here!",

So i was just laying in total darkness.\nWhen I noticed a light dimly illuminated the front of my peripheral vision.\nAt first i thought it were my eyes adjusting to the dark. \nBut i noticed the light was red. And that it was coming out from behind me.\nFrom the wall in which the front of my bed  layed.\nThere is no possible way of this making any scientific sense. \nAnd the light being red was one that reminded me of those red lights. Almost in a comical way, i thought about the song from TLC, red light special.\nThen, i started to get concerned because the red that manifested had the feeling that it came from Devil. Like the Devils red light. But i didn't panic but i wasn't comfortable.\nAs i started to think about Christ, the light changed into a bright white light that came from another direction and above where the red light disappeared.\nThe white light made the red light vanish.\nIt was clear the white light dominated.\nAnd as fast as the lights appeared they eventually vanished.\nAnd was left in total darkness.\nI failed to mention that when the red light shone, i had visions of futurstic entities suited in metallic armor. Almost in the most grotesque and frightening way possible that there was no way in a million years a person could just come up with that to even draw them.\nThey were entities in humans form but dressed partly metallic in ways that were frightening. To what appeared to be shoes or boots were in a shiny metal of some sort like titanium. That were long but served their purpose to be as long with the sharpest features.\nThat entity was armoured as it sat down on some type of chair wearing a matching metallic head gear. With sharp eye goggles that were sinister looking.\nIt's very hard to explain.\nAnd there were 2 of them dressed in a similar fashion.\nIt looked like they were up to something secretive but definitely up to no good.\nNow I can't say if this was a vision from the future or if it was something in the present in some dimension that isnt visible to the human eye.\nI dismissed the vision because i started to get uncomfortable and started to think of Christ and it was then when the white light illuminated from behind and to my Right side.\nThen, everything just went away.\nI don't know why i saw this or experienced it.\nBut i have always known that there are spirits all around us but our human eyes just can't see them.\nGod bless me and God bless all of you.",

Candles, pentagrams, using human teeth and animal bones.\nDont get me wrong though none of this is like, evil. It's in a protective way.\nThe weird part is we never followed a certain ruleset or religion. \nThe first time we did one of these it came naturally with no words exchanged between us. Since then we have just been doing them consistently on a nightly basis since we live in the forest.\n\nWell anyway, many rituals we had were very powerful feeling leading up to something weird. Not all, but some of them had this feeling about them. And maybe somehow we are both just delusional people feeding each others crazy. But i swear its doing stuff. \n\nlast night during the full moon, we had done a blood ritual. It felt very intense. After these rituals it usuallt drains a lot of energy even though its essentially sitting and meditating with maybe additional things. We drank each others blood.\nLater in the night we go out into the woods to moon bathe.\nWe lay by the river and talk about life, the universe. And kinda acknowledge how we feel like our souls are somehow connected.\nWhich was a weird feeling i've had since i've met him. But i felt it intensly, like from the moment i heard him talk it was like a tingle on the back of my neck. Like i felt drawn to him. And so we talked about that, and about how crazy but beautiful the shit we are doing is. \n\nAnyway, so we get up to head home. And i kid you not, he says \"do you see that\"\nAnd like 15ft away maybe in the distance i kid you not is a glowing rainbow flame thing. Its changing colors and glowing brightly and wisping around.\nThis is the middle of the woods at like 3:30AM\nNobody is ever out there.\n\nClear as fucking day a rainbow glowing orb flame thing, it looks like its bouncing around the trees, movements almost insect like.\nMy friend said he thinks it was a will o wisp.\n\nBut yeah, to date this is the craziest most paranormal shit i have ever seen.",

About a year or so ago she was diagnosed with a heart murmur, and just recently her breathing had became quite rapid, showing symptoms of the heart murmur advancing to late stages.\n\nAnyways, we had to travel away to another town for the day, and while we were away we visited a relative. While we were all standing up in the kitchen talking, I saw the shadow of what I assumed was either a dog or a cat, darting extraordinarily fast, and it went behind her fridge, note, there’s no room behind her fridge, nor anywhere else it could have gone, but I brushed it off as my eyes playing tricks on me due to me being stressed and anxious from driving.\n\nAnyways later on that night, once we had arrived back home, I mentioned this shadow to my mother. Once the words came out of my mouth, she looked shocked. She told me she had also seen that shadow, but you saw it run from my relatives stove/oven and out the door. \n\nNeither of us got any bad vibes from it, no chill or shudder down our spines, but it was definitely something spiritual.\nAnyways, the next day rolled around and we woke up, we went out into the kitchen and the dog seemed fine, but suddenly she jumped down from the chair, suddenly had trouble standing and deteriorated rapidly, eventually resulting in us taking her to the vet to be put to sleep which has been absolutely devastating.\n\nNow I’m here just wondering what that could’ve been? I’ve experienced paranormal things pretty much my entire life, from having orbs in my photos, to sleep paralysis, hearing footsteps and voices etc you name it!\n\nWould love to hear everyone’s thoughts on this",

        "text": " PARABLES OF THE BLACK \n\nPREFACE  \n\nThere are, or perhaps are not, dark things around us. If it is the conjuring's of the world  or of  our minds, perhaps we will never find out until its our time to go.  These are mine.  \n\nFor a long time my mother told me of my family history, both of her and my biological fathers.  For a long time I did not want to believe and often tried to refuse but eventually when I reached now  and being 25 I cant deny either that I  am mad OR I am something else. \n\nMy family history runs dark on my biological fathers side, wo was Arabian. His mother was the towns witch  who supposedly put Hex’s and performed other  acts for money . I've only met her once and that was when my biological father was still with us. I remember having awfully nightmares as a child, once that would haunt me for a long time. She got some hot water and wax, did a ritual and poured it next to my head and the wax took shape of a snake- exactly what haunted my dreams and then never had I had a nightmare of that specific origin.  My mother told me that on her side her grandfather was a kind man , good hearted and hardworking and sometimes she would feel like he could heal her. I always attributed it to a placebo effect. She  said when she would reach the age of 14 he would teach her how, sadly he passed when she was 12.  My mother hersle fclaims to be able to see and feel things and an acute 6th feel,  My aunt and grandma had an acute gift of reading cards and telling futures which later in life encouraged me to  do the same and then read tarots.  I reached the age of 24 and when I begun reading cards – they have never been wrong. I felt like a few of them almost called out to me but I was distant to the idea. \n\nI had a deck I still have to this day that I always keep next to me . It was a deck I resqued at a bar . I saw it misused and felt bad . I stole it from the people who did not give it proper respect as my grandmother always told me to treat playing cards with respect, while theya re play things they can also be vengeful. I started with it and it always warned me when something was incredibly Cards would fall out or  pull a few that would show me bad things – I attibuted it to a phycological effect but the accuracy always scare me. At 24 I got my first tarot deck .One with light hearted art and would use it  for answers or general  questions – sometimes I would almost use it as a therapy effect and see how my mind would connect things.  My family always warned me about tarots . They can instil and attract terrible things  but I learned that even when you get a bad reading there is no reason to be afraid or anxious. You now simply know which way things are heading and there is an opportunity to better yourself – future is never set in stone and if you might understand better what is to come , then you can better yourself.  The cards answer a question depending on your current outlook . Then there was  one deck that called out to me, filled with horror art and monsters – some of them seeming eerily familiar- I keep the 3 separate and use them at different needs or current feelings.  \n\nOur house, here in my country, was on the lei line I found out and many strange things would happen and when we came here, my mother never felt comfortable  and I begun understanding when I began seeing. The first time I saw was when  I was downstairs and my mother was upstairs. I saw a girl, and Ill never forget it .  Out of the corner of my eye first and then partly within my sight. A girl with a pony tail , jeans and a green shirt. I only saw the back of her and thought it was my mother first and called out to her . I saw her walks around the corner briefly  making a turn into the kitchen. When I fully turned there was no one there and when I called out for mom, she was upstairs. Then I knew something was amuk – it was something passing by. \n\nI swear to you that I write this after years of deliberation and thought. Over the years I've learned to channel this fear into art and have presented an image of them so you can see what I saw. \n\n1. The Black , who watches by the stair case.  \n\nHe , this one is the one that I now understand has haunted my mother since the start and why she felt so uncomfortable.  The first time I saw him I was a pre-teen. I've always felt somewhat uncomfortable. Something was always watching me and instilling deep, deep fear. I could never be on my own in the house and would always see a tall, lanky shadow  in the corner of my eye , standing over – peering, waiting, watching. Our house is structured  with the  front door mediately leading to the  stairs. On the left an entrance to the living room, on the right dining room  connecting to a thin long kitchen with a hole into the living room. Upstairs to the right was my room  and the bathroom and to the left my parents room and  small office.   Whenever I was home alone I felt something peering at me from the door into the living room or the window behind me . Eventually I started fortifying myself in the small office which had the pc in it. The door and entrance to it was right on the side of the stairs. I didn’t want to mention it to my mother as her mood was fickle and sometimes she would listen and share and others be aggressive about it. \n\nOne day my  parents when food shopping as they always did on a Friday night, and I did not want to join them. I fortified myself in the computer room office, with the door open and browsed the internet. Suddenly I felt cold , I felt uneasy . I felt a pair of two eyes .  This wasn’t a new feeling – sometimes when the door stayed open, I felt a pair of eyes on me . Our of the corner of my eyes I would see, in a hazy manner, almost a head peering out from the stairs and watching me . When I feel like that I could  close the door and turned the music on loud.   \n\nThat day it was different. I felt the cold and the peering eyes .  I turned my head and it horrified me. I saw him clearly  but still in a hazy see thought manner.  A head  and wide eyes and a grin, ear to ear, his head tilted to a side. His hands were hold the  base of the stairs.   He was smiling and watching me and then I saw him lunge at me.  The hands which griped the stair casing pushed It forward and it has never happened before  - I have never seen him move . It moved closer  and just as it got closer to the door I shut it with my back against it – hearing light scratching.  I didn’t scream or make a noise .  My family always told me that if I ever see the malicious shadows – I give them as little response as I can.  \n\nI kept that door shut for 2 and a half hours until my parents returned, sometimes hearing the creeping of the stairs and a light scratching . I recall  turning on the music on and begun singing along , making sure I kept fear at bay hoping to make it look and feel as I wasn’t afraid. My grandmother also warned me that if I ever saw the shadows , I would sing , or prey . That day I sung but I never preyed.  After that day I would never leave the door open to that room. I was often yelled at and told to keep the door open when my parents were in the house, but I took the heat – I  did not think I could handle that again.  I did not want to tell my mother as I thought something was wrong with me .  To this day I feel it but I have learned to be different. Now that I know I developed my own fortification system of the mind. Over the years I've learned to locate where something is and fortify my emotions and never let curiosity get the better of me.  \n\nI realised that having no fear of them or even Him in particular did not make them go away and that’s when I knew  this might not be madness. To this day I see him , on outline of him at the top of the stairs whenever I walk by. I would feel a leer and a stare and when I was younger and still living with my parents, I felt a presence by the door whenever I would sleep and never slept with the lights of , but it would never come in or at least never go past the corner of the room  which lead from the door.  Sometimes I would feel it crawling from the stairs as I go into my room and would quickly shut the door. Sometimes I would see a glimmer of a pair of eyes. \n\nYears later I told my mom and begun speaking about it  with her. I remember her face going pale and my horror . She described him the same way I did, becouse I asked her to go first. Manky, lean ,  big eyes and a smile. She said it was why she could never be in the house herself either. She also saw him peering through the stairs, sometimes crawling up. She on then other hand was different-  she could never keep the door closed becouse if she did she felt him on the other side . She kept the door open and kept an eye on it.  One time she said it had the audacity to go into her room which is why she kept holy water from a monastery  in my room hidden. She was always afraid to talk about it until now.  She said it haunted her often , even in dreams and once saw it at the foot of the bed and at the door to her room in the night.  She said she never saw it move, only leer and watch.   \n\nHe who watched from the stairs is still there and every time I return to my parents, I face him with confidence.  My mother always hypothesise that someone prior to my step father , who lived in this house, may have died on the stairs  but there is no proof or way we can find out.  \n\n1.  The Black , a boy in wishes.  \n\nI began seeing him around the same age as I begun seeing the Black from the stairs. Now that I think  back to it , I think he may have found comfort in me from the Black on the Stairs. He was harmless, but sometimes I would feel a sharp look – that look you get when someone watches you in jealousy.   \n\nWith the door closed in the computer room, I would still feel chills  but they were different. Not malicious but scared and sad  and when I felt it being malicious I would do what my family told me back in my country of origin, another rule. Offer food  and voice out the words “Pleasee, there are fruits and sweets downstairs to your  souls desire, please help yourself and leave me be”.  Whenever I would feel this lonely chill behind me I would say it . The tradition was a means to offer something  and while not welcoming someone in as that is a bad idea  – instead being a good host ands no one can hate a good host I was told. \n\nOne day I turned round before saying those words and I saw a faint outline of a boy shorter than me. His hair black and mid long,  covering his face. He was looking down and I felt such despair and sadness from him. He was  wearing a stripey shirt and did not speak and simply looked down. I did not react as I felt it was on a line of maliciousness. I turned back around and continued what I was doing and said those words but instead of offering food  I would tell him he can play with any toy he wanted. Sometimes I would bring toys and leave them behind me . I never saw him anywhere but the PC room and I think now a days that he may have taken refuge with me from the Black on the Stairs . Maybe he wanted to play, maybe he was sad I was alive, and he was not.  \n\nWhen I spoke to my mother about him at too, she confirmed it was something she always saw also but never as clearly as me. I asked my mother if she ever saw anything else and she said he had always felt a child like presence . She said she only saw hazy outlines at times and never as clearly as me and would offer him food to leave her be .  She was always more brash with these things and sometimes I wonder if she feels haunted because of it. I stopped seeing him when I became a teenager. I did not feel him anymore but was always kind to him . I would tell him I was scared and I was sorry and he was welcome to play with anything of mine.  I sometimes wonder if he managed to move on- he was sad , so much sadness that I sometimes cried  for him .  \n\nAfter this , a few years passed since I've seen anything that strongly. I would still feel maliciousness around me but I never looked at it and never gave it a second thought and tried to convince myself I was just mad and none of this was real. Things outside and inside, blacks and shows.  \n\n1.  The Black, a lady who lead me to the edge.  \n\nOn the day of Hallows eve I had a doctor appointment, I travelled to it by foot and then by the time it was needed to leave it was dark. I was filled with adrenaline then, thinking I was untouchable. At that point I embraced that I was either crazy or different and thought it made me special until that day on Hallows Eve.  The road to the doctor needed you to walk on a pathway, on one side there where racing cars on a big road and on the other an old church and graveyard.  I avoided that area  like a plague because I always felt something was wrong. The couple of times I crossed thought it the abandoned graves gave me a bad feeling and I often felt followed and eventually when I felt seen I stopped walking through it. I was too bold and too proud of myself back then. \n\nThe  pathway was around the church , separated by a  short wall.  As I was walking by something caught my eye in the far of the graveyard by the tree. I felt almost tranced,  I knew not to look. I knew I shouldn’t turn my head but curiosity got the better of me thinking I could persevier and show it “ who’s the boss”. I turned my head and stopped walking  and saw Her. She was leering  behind a tree and watching me from afar . Her taloned skelleter and sharp hands  on the trunk of a tree,  peering behind as half of her body was hidden .I saw long hair which covered most of her face and the outlines of eyes that shimmered. As soon as I locked eyes,  I saw it move. I saw small movements coming closer moving from around the grave that she stood by and the tree that hid half her body . Loing messy hair and the outline of a robed starved , thin, tall woman. Fear overtook me and the second I felt the rush of it  , she begun moving it and I begun backing  away – my mind forgetting the road behind me . As I took a couple of steps , nearing myself into the road and she moved closer I thought to myself – can they finally hurt me? \n\nAlas, the clock striked 8 and the church bell rung and I woke up from my trance and looked up at the church that was to the side of the graveyard. The bells were ringing and as I looked back, she was gone , I think I caught gimpses of her skittering away. I took a few breaths and for the first time thanked  God for this one. I can home that day , taking the long way around the church  and graveyards and vowed that now that I held knowledge . That that curiosity would not get the better of me . For years my mother wanted to crisen me but I was always afraid that my gift would go away. These shadows around made me feel at home sometimes, less lonely and the fear would make me feel alive but that day I considered that I might need help.  \n\nThe scary thing now is the horror tarot deck that called out to me at 24 – well , there was a creature card there that looked eerily similar , as if somone saw something like it. The face, the clothes and those cursed bony claws.  I still think about her  and I think what would have happened to me. That day taught me that they cannot hurt me physically but through fear – they can lead me somewhere to the edge.  \n\nAfter that I was more acutely aware of the things around me . I sharpened my tuning skills and coping mechanisms whether it was psychosis or something abnormal. When I lived alone I felt things pass me by – trying to scare me but I learned to live with them and be a good host.  In my first renting apartment when I lived on my own things passed by. I would sometimes see devices fliker and items which couldn’t possibly be in a place, be droped. One time in the night I saw a flip switch in my kitchen go on and of – on and off .I would simply turn my back to it and ignore the grawing feeling at my back.  I was also often haunted in my nightmares. I became a lucid dreamer and over the years had many malicious things come to me ,killing me, trapping me  but I learned to control it  and recover quickly. I learned to channel it into art . \n\n1. The Black,  who eats dreams. \n\nThis goes back to when I still lived with my parents. I had many fearfull dreams like my mother who often told me she saw awful things in her dreams and vows she's even seen Death itself . She was often unwell and I was much the same.  I sometimes think if this is really the case that maybe she took on a lot for me – things chipped at her soul more than mine. \n\nI knew that the Black at the Stairs never entered my room any further then the dark corner by the door but on that dark night something else came out-  something that I still think is with me although I've learned that he is me now . My mother was a good hard working woman but the pain her family instilled on her often came out on me. She would do things rashly and out of malice, and  it often drove me to a deep depression and anxiety even as a child. I don’t know if He is a manifestation of those fears and hauntings but he was my first night terror and I still feel him at the corner of my dreams when I stay in lucidity for too long.  I remember being awake and my night light flickering .I had this fear and growling at the tip of my stomach so I turned my face towards the wall  but it got worse. I felt something in the room- something evil and something BIG like it filled the whole room. I felt the fear bubbling in my pit, I felt almost like tentacles enveloping me .  I gathered all my strength and bravely . I felt that if I turned around something bad would happen to me, something would take me but I couldn’t just wait . After swallowing that fear I finally turned around in confidence and I saw  flickers of it. I saw almost like a monster. I saw a brief outline of its  tentacles and felt the sharpness of its teeth .  It almost filled by toom and took my voice. \n\nEventually I screamed louder than anytime I ever did. It awoke my parents who ran  and let me sleep. They told me it was a bad dream , but how could it be a dream if I wasn’t asleep. Maybe it was a night terror but alas .  Since that day I felt it had almost attached itself in me. I saw him again in the deepest of my dreams when I was 21.  I was in a lucid dream – a skill I sharpened over the years and found out that with enough awareness and confidence I could stay there and enjoy the world , crafting it as I pleased and if it got too much I knew death would wake me up – learning the confidence and lack of fear that comes with it  but I always knew I couldn’t stay too long. \n\nOne day I stayed too long in Wonderland and I was suddenly in the house of my parents again I felt uneasy, and I felt the giant monster. I looked way to kill myself and escape the dream but  the house begun emptying out . I would not ever reach the rooth to jump out of  sleep. All the blades in the house were dull and eventually disappeared . I begun running down stair case that never ended . The more I ran , the more  darker the dream got until it was all black and I was running  with him behind me. I saw him clearly that night  gnawing and running after me . I tried to scream, scream lounder than I ever could and eventually I found my voice just as it almost caught me or when it caught me. Since then murderous things came after me and I began hating sleep .I  threw myself into works of fiction and making my lucid dreams those fictions, I never tried to craft the world again beyond one that wasn’t mine but murderous dreams still follow me. Things scaring me and killing me , chasing me and eventually I learned to face them with grace and recover fast. I couldn’t escape so I had to learn to persevere.  \n\nA few dreams I still go back to some dreams.  Maybe he is me and eventually I begun thinking it was simply the manifestation of my trauma over the years but he still feels foreign , like it isn't quiet a part of me.  I think eventually whatever gift my mother may have had, or what ever madness she had passed to me. The dream I would go back to a girl I once saw . She seemed so real and I've even sketched her out a few times. My age, in a frowly vblowse, trousers , black shoes and a pale face. She was blond and had curly hair, loose and  beautiful . She was trying to speak to me, tell me something but her voice I could not hear. I always hoped and still hope that maybe one day I might meet her , maybe fate would bring us together.  I saw Him again a few years after , same figure chasing me down and the dream eventually ending as it gets me , or just before and a scream waking me.  \n\nOther horrors and dreams I begun putting into art – its how I live with it , I  do not fear anymore as much as I am cautios.  At this age I almost consider them as residential friends . In a sick sense of things they almost make me feel not alone.  Sometimes its comforting but sometimes I feel the maliciousness and when I do I establish confidence . I fortify  myself and as long as I am the Master of the House – they will follow rules  if they wish to be hosted well. \n\nThe Drema Eater made me realise this  and when I loose control is when he tries to strike . I drse them and put them on my walls, its my way of saying I see you and I do not fear.  \n\n5  The Blacks, who seek a hosting \n\n On many occasions, especially when my mind is at its weakest and most tiered, I would see other Blacks on a daily manner. \n\nI used to avidly go to an arcade at night. I knew the owner and we would often run it at night and play ourselves. In the store and around the games I would see a Black , sometimes at the counter and sometimes by the older games, a black outline . I would sometimes see him behind me as I played games , an outline of the black watching me . Or byu the counter , or often looking about.  It knew I knew because I would always look back and try and find him-  he meant  no harm and I only felt curiosity, so I let it be. \n\nOften  a variety of Blacks would be in the apartments I lived by . I noted once that I heard flickering switches and gnawing at my back as I slept. But there was one  creeper I saw in my 3rd apartment. It was filled with a lot of pain and sorrow and I think that attracted them , or maybe it was just a manifested psychosis of my deep anxiety and sorrow but with how similar my art was I suspect that it was just the one same . But there was a few more. There was a peerer by the door that would often see and  I would simply ignore and it eventually left. \n\nThere was a creeper who leered in the dark , Iwould see him at night. At first just the shadow of its face and then I saw it , full in body and scare the living spirits out of me , making me fall down onto the floor at which point I begun fortifying myself , standing my own.  \n\nSometime I would see something on the balcony scratching by , never coming in and on those days I kept the  door to the balcony shut until the morning.  \n\nA few times I've seen a few of them by my bed site,  A glimer of something in the dark which was illuminated by thunder. A human looking thing. Its moth opened wide and a saw its mouth it caused me sleep paralysis .Then  when I was asleep I heard whispers in the dead of night around me  and in my half awake status I saw shadows , multiple shadows  walking around  and looking over me. What awoke me is a video  I was listening and suddenly ehardf the words : “ I was so scared “ and “ help” and other  please and moans .  On both occasions I simply got up with confidence, turned the lights on and went back to sleep. In the morning though I checked thought the video as I recall the time  and where the video was at when I awoke – funny I relistening to it and heard nothing of the sort I heard at night. \n\nFINALITIES \n\nWell, I still feel things around me. Maybe I am a beacon . My mother always told me that I am somone trapped between the dark and light and the Blacks were tempting me over.  The Black lady made me realise that I cannot be too proud of myself or invite them too deeply – that falling too deep to them is bad and refused to be christened for now because being in between feels right. Whether its my mind playing trix iis up to the reader from  years of trauma , pain , suffering and facing death square on or maybe something's out there . Alas I treat my in-between balance with respect- never delving too much into either and using it to any advantage. I never follow any  ideologies other than my own – I think many people out there overexadurate or are simply mad  and too wound up in it – feeling too special with the gifts they might have. I try to remain humble now , simply being a good host and using what in neutral .  \n\nI've never been a fan of people and spend time  in solitude because I've found that  by being acutely aware of the darks around me I begun seeing clearly the dark in others and people just make me feel even lonelier. The Blacks make me feel less alone sometimes – when I see them clearly I draw and try and better myself  and take it as opportunities and warnings.   \n\nI don’t know if God is real or if any of this is real but I will remain true to my own ideologies and when its my time, maybe Ill find the answer  but for now my friends in the dark will always let me know when my mind and soul are becoming weaker - always giving me the choice of falling into their arms or to keep going.  \n\nI will be the Master of my own Home and Mind. None are welcome whop seek to be cruel .",

It was like I was wide awake and he was standing in front of me, and I remember being taken aback, even in the dream, upon seeing him. But the really remarkable thing is he looked like he'd aged. His hairline was higher, his hair greyer.\n\nI don't remember him saying or doing anything. He just stood there and looked at me serenely. He was anything but serene in life (lol) so I guess that was kind of comforting.",

We are in a nice area. \n\nThe house has a bright orange 70s kitchen, I period 70s fire surround and 70s issue gas fires.\n\nThe previous owner was a bit of a handyman and wired lightbulbs in cupboards, had a thing for putting wires behind walls et cetera.\n\nEver since we moved in, it has been a bit of a creepy vibe. My kids won’t stay downstairs on their own.  My little girl will follow me upstairs and downstairs because she doesn’t want to be left alone.\n\nAbout three times I have heard somebody walking around downstairs.\n\nI have gone down to investigate and nobody there.\n\nKitchen cupboards have banged. Again, nobody was there.\n\nAnd then the icing on the cake, the smoke detectors which were situated on the windowsill because they were broken and the landlord won’t replace them went off at 4 am in the morning.\n\nI went down and investigated and nothing was on fire.\n\nI bought new smoke detectors and install them, and I haven’t heard the old smoke detectors go off since.\n\nDuring the night, all the lights downstairs are on. The kitchen hall and living room lights stay on.  This seems to stop the footsteps and the cupboards bang.\n\nI did do a quick look for vermin.\n\nI couldn’t find any holes, droppings etc. Food is untouched, no holes, nibbled in packaging, et cetera. \n\nThe kids are trying to persuade me to look in the attic. Not going to do that.  I am disabled so looking in the attic it’s probably something that I don’t particularly want to do. I don’t want to encourage the children to look in the attic either because I don’t want a foot to put through the ceiling!\n\nI’m also getting nagged to do odd jobs. Basically drawn towards fixing stuff. The blinds in the downstairs rooms. A kitchen drawer which I didn’t know, needed fixing. And the front garden needs doing.\n\nIt’s a bit of a boring haunting really!",

And my dog which is what I believe this is had more empathy and compassion then most people. He was also given to me after my friend died at the age of 12. I always felt like he was a reincarnation of him and I have mentioned it to people on several occasions. I always think about that dog but a day or two ago I really started thinking about him. What do y’all think, it’s a ghost it’s not a glare or dust or anything. The door is on the other side just a wall so not a glare and it dematerialized and rematerialized in frame it’s grainy but it’s clear enough to see this take place and it’s slowed down so it ain’t no dust no light tv is off please go to my tiktok @pressleyincorporated and I’ll post it on my Reddit too",

        "text": "So, when I was younger I had a ticklish anne doll, (one of those old creepy babies that make noises when you pushed on its belly) and my dad said he would get really creeped out when I was really young because he would put it up on the shelf when I was asleep but would quite often wake up in the middle of the night to it going off in my crib next to me. (My crib was in the same room as him so it was easy for him to hear it). The only way these dolls would go off is if someone pushes the belly of them and the position he would always find it in was in the corner of the crib by my head staring down at me.\n\nI have always had the feeling someone or something has been following me throughout my childhood and into adulthood and have had multiple paranormal experiences that I can't easily explain away even things that have nothing at all to do with this doll experience. They give me the shivers every time I think about them. \n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience.",

        "text": "\nMy dad has vascular dementia and lives in an assisted living facility. I come over a couple times a week to take him to doctor appointments, fill up his weekly medication box, etc. We both have a set of keys to his room. \nLast week he texted me to say that management had found my set of keys on the floor in one of the bathrooms. I looked on my purse where I usually keep my keys and sure enough they were missing. (I don’t know if that detail matters, but I’ll include it anyway). I thanked him and told him just to hold on to them for me and i'll get them when I come over to fill his meds.  \n\nSo a couple days later i'm there to fill his meds, I look down at my purse and my set of keys are there. Not missing. Weird, but I kind of shrug it off. When he answers his door he says \"Here's your keys!\" and hands them to me. On the set there is one key for his door, one for his mailbox, and a little key fob with a barcode and ID number on it from the local library.  I showed him that that set wasn't mine after all and suggested that maybe they belonged to one of the nurses that come twice a day to despense his medication. I had passed a couple of his nurses on my way to his room, so I jogged down the hall over to them and asked if the keys belonged to them. \nThe nurses told me that not only was it not theirs, but there is only one mailbox key per room, so if I had mine, then this one should not exist...  \n\nOne of the nurses, Rachel, turned to the other nurse and whispered, \"The only thing I can think of is... Bob ___?\" I watched as both of their faces went pale. \nThen Rachel had the great idea of calling the local library to tell them that we had found a set of keys with the library's fob on it and wanted to return it to the owner. The librarian of course said that they were not able to give out personal information, and they would have to contact the owner themselves. So Rachel just blurted out \"OK well if it belongs to who I think it does, his name is Bob and he's dead, so he won't mind. Is the owner’s name Bob___?\" The librarian then confirmed that the owner of the fob was the very same first and last name that the nurses had been whispering about. \nAfter hanging up and taking a few moments to herself, Rachel explained to me that Bob ___ was the last resident to live in my dad's room before my dad, and that he had died there. \nShe then proceeded to tell me that his room had been empty for THREE YEARS because any time a new resident moved in there, they would quickly complain that the room was haunted and demand a different room. My dad is the first person in three years who hasn't noticed. \nMy dad has officially been in that room for 6 months now, and it seems that Bob has finally returned his keys.",

It’s a bone chilling, stomach dropping, physical shaking kind of vibe. I’ve refused to set up his nursery and just bought him a bassinet for my room. Well today I put on my big girl pants and decided to set it up, while taking a picture and video of his room with the flash on, there was a LARGE peach/orange orb on his crib and during the video a small white/fluorescent one that zoomed past the camera when the camera was on the crib. I’ve opened the windows and will do a salt water spray in the morning when I’m not so freaked. In the past, my cat has been locked in the closet of this room, I’ve heard the door slam a few times as well with no windows open. I also have a deadbolt lock on my front door only able to be locked from the inside or outside with a key and one time while I still had my cat, I came home to it locked, I know I did not lock because I had both my keys inside and have a bad habit of locking it, I called my landlord asking if anyone with a set had came by and he said no one has keys but him and he did not come by, nothing in my home was out of place but my cat was freaking out.. I need advice or someone to tell me I’m just paranoid.\nDo I ask or do I tell it to leave? What can I use in the meantime until I can get cleansing items to try and rid of it?!",

        "text": "Ok my weird thing like this was in 2009 as well. I was a senior in Highschool. One night, about a week before Thanksgiving, my buddy Nick called me at like 3am and woke me up out of my sleep. He seemed very distressed and scared, and with a quivering voice told me that he just has the most lucid and freaky dream he had ever had. He told me in his dream that him, my girlfriend at the time, and I were all in a car, turning right onto the road right across the street from our high-school we attended. He said as he turned, a huge truck ran the red light, his car, and killed all 3 of us. I thought it was really weird that he was calling me in the middle of the night to tell me, so I told him to calm down, smoke a J, and go back to bed. \n\nFast forward one week, and my buddy Nick and I were over at our friend Dan's house for a lil Friendsgiving dinner, and because we wanted to smoke and his parents were chill with weed. Dan's dad was a raging drunk and would start fights with us sometime, and for some reason that was my day to deal with him. Instead of engaging, I asked Nick if he could just give me a ride to my girlfriends house. We went to pick up my Gf, grab a dank sack of bud, and roll up some blunts and smoke by our school. As he was preparing to turn right, the light turned green giving us the signal to turn. As he is pressing on the gas to turn he gets a weird feeling, looks to his left, and SLAMS on the brakes. A giant ass Ford F-350 went flying thru the red light, and narrowly missed our car by maybe 6-12 inches at most. Had he gone a little farther, we would have all been dead (he drove a small lil rice burner race car at the time)... Needless to say, him and I were both SHOOK by the experience and he explained that that was EXACTLY what had happened in his dream a week before.\n\nAs the Cherokee used to say, \"Dreams are today's answers to tomorrow's questions.\" \n\nThank God for whatever Guardian Angel had our back that night, cuz I wouldn't be here today to tell this story. Still gives me goosebumps anytime I talk about it.",

Well one night I was trying to sleep while my sis was on her phone. As I was trying to sleep I kept hearing seagulls and I kept thinking omg why won't she change the tiktok, finally I was upset to the point I sat up and told her to turn it down. She looks at me with wide eyes and says \"I thought that was you\". My eyes go wide and I thought wtf. Well sis texted one our guardians because their room was across from ours. Then my sister and I walked out into the hallway to talk to said guardian. I was ahead of sis and realized wait that's coming from the end of the hall in the bathroom. I told sis then started to walk that way. When I got close to the bathroom I felt this surge of panic so I quickly turned around bumped into my sis and we both ran back to our room. Well 1 of our guardians came and checked on what we were doing cause we were loud. Well we told them what happened and 1 of our brothers came down to see what that seagull noise was. Turns out it was a toy my littlest brother had. But the only way to turn it on was to push a button. We were too scared to go in there and turn it off well thankfully 1 of the grown ups did but then later in the night it went off again. Then the next day when my sis and brother was home alone it had gone off again. Finally my brother put it outside in the snow. This was only one of many paranormal experiences I've had.",

        "text": "To preface, I (32,M) have always been deeply interested/affected by the paranormal. From as early as I can remember, I always got weird/scared vibes in certain places, I would always see \"shadow people\" out of the corner of my eyes, and always felt like someone or something was watching me in my room when I slept. It was to the point where I would beg my parents to let me sleep on the ground next to their bed, and when they inevitably told me no, I'd begrudgingly walk back to my room, TERRIFIED. Every night I would have dreams that a monster/vampire/demon would chase me, until I'd eventually just give in and stop running, at which point I'd be \"eaten/killed\" and snap outta my sleep. The only time I ever had peace at night time as a child (8yr old) was when we bought a grey Tabby kitten. I truly feel like he protected me in my sleep, because for the year he was alive, my bad dreams went away (he died of Leukemia at a year old).\n\nFast forward to 2021, I was 30 years old, and worked at a family run Neapolitan Pizza shop, that was right next to a Game Stop. I was the opening manager, so I would arrive everyday at 7AM, and start the dough, along with getting the wood-fire oven hot. I would ALWAYS hear weird things, like pots and pans clanking together, spatulas falling to the ground, doors closing, lights turning off and then back on when I would approach the switch, etc etc... No one else arrived til 10, so I was always creeped out, but would usually blast my music louder to try and dull out the sensation of fear. \n\nOne particular day, I arrived at my usual, 7AM, and noticed a deposit bag laying in the middle of our kitchen. It was wayyy to far away from the front door to have been tossed inside by a good Samaritan, so I assumed it was my closing manager slipping up. I opened the bag, and see a deposit for $1500, all cash, with a GameStop receipt on top of the cash inside the bag. This kinda weirded me out, but I shrugged it off and waited for the GameStop employees to arrive so I could return the bag and save someone from getting canned. When I saw the manager arrive, I walked next door and said, \"Hey, you missing this?\". I'll never forget the way that dude looked at me. He was half confused and half suspicious, as if I had stole the bag or something. He asked me, \"what the actual fuck? How did you get that bag?!\" To which I told him I found it on the ground, in the middle of our kitchen. He was even more perplexed, as he was the closing manager the night before, and he distinctly remembered putting the deposit in the safe and locking up the store. I assured him I didn't steal it, and if I did I wouldn't be returning it to them. He then randomly asked me if I ever hear sounds or see things over at my job, and I told him yeah, that stores haunted as fuck. Apparently, they experienced the same exact thing at their spot, rather frequently.\n\nThis is where it gets really weird. GameStop's always have PlayStations and Xbox inside the store, usually contained inside some sort of plastic container. He tells me that because of COVID, the Sony technicians hadn't been to their store in a year and half. He tells me that they don't even have keys to the container and cannot open it to change games or do anything to it. He instructs me to go look at the PlayStation and tell him what I see. I walked over, and I see that at least 2cm.of dust had collected on top of the PlayStation, which is normal if nobody has even opened the plastic container in a year and half... But then I bent over and took a better look, and sure enough, right in the middle of all the dust, was a child's hand print. I have kids myself, so for reference, the hand was the size of a 2 year olds hand. I was spooked, and asked him WTF is up with that?! He tells me he thinks it's a kid ghost that haunts their store, and more than likely mine as well. He also said he never believed in the paranormal or anything like that, as he was a scientific type fellow, but after working at that location for a few years and especially after that impossible hand print, his whole worldview shifted.\n\nI have a few more stories which I will post in due time, but for now, God speed and God bless.🙏♥️",

        "text": "When I was growing up I was very close with my maternal grandparents. I called them Mama and Tata (mother and father... that's what I heard my mom call them and assumed it was their names when I was about a year old). When speaking of them I still refer to them this way till today.\n\nTata passed away from a stroke when I was 9 years old, and I never got to say goodbye. My mom didn't think such small children should see their grandparent in such a state in the hospital.  \nAbout 15 years ago Mama's health was failing. She was in a coma for a couple of weeks, then she recovered and there was even talk of sending her home with a nurse.  \nKnowing Mama, since I was very close with her, I knew she would hate that. She was very independent and she wouldn't like to have someone help her with anything. I felt dread. A few days later she went back into a coma. The doctors said there was very little chance she would recover.\n\nMy parents and I were living in a different country from Mama at that time. My mom decided she would go and visit her (and her sister who was taking care of Mama) and asked me if I wanted to go as well.  \nAlthough I really wanted to go and see Mama one last time, I decided not to go for two reasons. One reason being it was summer vacation and I had just gotten a job at a summer camp (rent needs to be paid). But the main reason being that Mama always told me not to waste my money on travelling for sad occasions, only for happy ones (there was an incident years before, I don't remember what it was, but the lesson stuck with me). So I knew she wouldn't like me to waste so much money on a plane ticket to come and see her as she's dying.\n\nAbout a week goes by, and one night I'm lying in bed, trying desperately (and failing) to fall asleep. It was one of those night where you keep looking at the clock, repeatedly thinking \"if I fall asleep riiiight now, I will have this much time to sleep before I have to go to work\".  \nIt just wasn't happening so I gave up, just laid in my bed, on my back and stared at the ceiling.\n\nI blink.\n\nI'm standing on the beach, near Mama's house. I can feel the breeze, I can smell and hear the ocean and the seagulls, I can feel the sun on my face. I turn around slowly and about 20 feet in front of me stands Mama, smiling at me. Then, she turns around to face away from me and we both see my grandfather (Tata) standing just behind her. They walk towards each other, smiling, they hug and kiss and have the most heartfelt reunion I have ever seen. Tata passed away when I was just 9 years old, nearly 20 years prior to that day. I stare in awe.  \nAfter what seemed like a few minutes my grandparents both turn to look at me. They are holding hands, smiling, tears of joy streaming down their faces, they are just glowing. They wave to me goodbye with air kisses and smiles still on their faces, turn around and start walking away from me and slowly fade.\n\nI open my eyes and I'm in my room, lying in my bed, on my back, staring at the ceiling. Tears running down my face. I knew at that moment two things. One, Mama passed. Two, I will not be falling asleep that night. The clock on my phone, on my bedside table, read 4:00 am.\n\nThe next few hours are a bit of a blur since I had been inconsolable, couldn't stop crying.  \nMy phone rang at 8:00 am. It was my dad telling me that Mama had passed.  \nI asked him if he knew what time it was when she passed. He told me in their country it was 11:00 am.\n\nThe time difference between our time zones is exactly 7 hours (they are ahead).\n\nI must stress this wasn't a dream. I never actually fell asleep. I didn't feel tired at all that night, not before and definitely not after the vision. I wasn't even sure which flair to add to this post.\n\nEither way, I'm so grateful to Mama and Tata for this wonderful memory. For the love that I felt from them that day. They went out of their way to come see me to say goodbye before moving on.  \nI will remember that for as long as I live.",

        "text": "TL:DR at the bottom.\nI’m a security guard and nothing was going on before or after this happened, but there was a distressed female scream from outside that nobody except for one other person heard. It was very very loud, I heard it crystal clear from inside the building I work in, and the other witness was just outside the door on a phone call. I am absolutely sure this was a person, I don’t work near the woods, (in a busy urban area) so it couldn’t have been a wild animal, and while it could’ve been someone on drugs yelling and screaming as usual, I’m positive this wasn’t a typical scream you’d hear from someone walking around out of their mind on drugs. Yes it could’ve been the Aztec death whistle (look it up if you need to), but the fact that nobody else heard it is what’s bugging me. There were people walking by on the street, and nobody turned heads, not even a dog that someone was walking acknowledged it. \nI check the perimeter of the building, asked construction workers if they had/heard anything happening, and not a single thing. I have another guard out back who easily could’ve heard it, but nothing. \nIt might be a stretch but I’ve been thinking about Banshees. Please don’t call me crazy or try to debunk it, all I want to know is the point of the post. \nSo point of the post, can multiple people hear a banshee scream?",

        "text": "I’ve experienced quite a bit and I’m always excited to go more places and discover new things. There are certain experiences that I don’t really know if it was pareidolia or not. I heard my name whispered like it was carried in the wind blowing past my ear. Something that the two people who I was with who where in mid-conversation behind me didn’t hear. This was during Covid in spring 2020. We were talking a walk through woods that potentially people have died in. However, this is information my barber who’s lived in the area for a long time told me a year later. Nevertheless we collectively felt that we were being followed in those woods and I did initiate the running back home while we were already on the trek back (I can elaborate more on this and other experiences I’ve had if anyone cares for it). But I still don’t know if that was auditory pareidolia or not. I know that when I was 5-7 there was this blanket that someone threw over the back of the rocking chair in the living room. And I could swear it looked just like a person. I walked downstairs and went into the kitchen only to see it. It was so terrifyingly real looking like a horrifying shape sitting there that I froze for a while. To be fair, I was in the kitchen standing rather a ways away in bad lighting. I’m not proud of it and I hate freezing at anything which is happily something I never do now. But I can give myself props that I stared down the chair for maybe 5 to 10 minutes until my eyes adjusted and I could see that it was a blanket. I felt like a fool. I went over to the chair and saw that blanket just sitting there. But I went over back to where I was standing before and it was still surprising that even after all that I could see what it was that I saw before. It really was in the shape of a person from that angle. Fascinating indeed. Still it goes to show, some things are most definitely pareidolia, others unsure, some definitely not. \n\nI have some more stories just like this but I’m interested what people have experienced like this. Are there things that you know for a fact were pareidolia or other experiences like this in general? Maybe it came help prove or debunk things others have seen or heard.",

I remember not knowing when the sound started just that I was eventually aware of it. It sounded sound loud but that’s reasonable because my dresser is right next to my bed. I didn’t wake up to it because I didn’t find the motivation to wake up and look. But I did wake up to my mom opening my door and turning the lights on. She asked me are you opening the door? I told her no but I heard the sounds as well. She said don’t lie. I told her I couldn’t have because you woke me up coming in the door. She left to go look around the house then we went to bed.\n\n\nThat’s it then the next day was normal thoughts?\n\nOh i also have another experience from when my grandpa died. I was a Little Boy but this memory is burning clear as day. I was living at my grandmas house with my dad and his girlfriend and was just told of his passing. Two nights after I was still awake watching the door(I was afraid of the dark and learned to be aware of everything so I stayed up and watched the room) then I saw two white horses but like really tiny ones. Small where a toy soldier could ride them. They went into my room and stood there. I know I wasn’t sleeping because I took it as something “peaceful” and went to see who slept in grandmas basement.

        "text": "Introduction: I’m a store manager who’s working in a very old building in central London - about over 200 years old. \n\nAnd as much as I’d want it to be fine, the place just doesn’t feel very right. I don’t know what it is, but sometimes it just gets very tense.\n\nAnyway, there have been strange incidences. Once, a girl in the stock room got spooked by something. She said something flew “in front of her face” and she heard noises “that shouldn’t be there at all”.\n\nThen there’s the lift. The building has 7 floors, and there are multiple floors of my shop and there are two other main managers, and we mostly use the lift to either go the stock room, office or whatever. \n\nWell anyway, sometimes the lift is very strange. Every time when it’s either very early in the morning or when everyone leaves the building, the lift starts acting weird. Like really weird. From various issues like doors not opening, to something like the lift following you around. \n\nFor instance, one time I tried to go from the 1st to the 3rd floor. I got inside the lift on the 1st floor, the doors shut. I press the 3rd floor button to go up. But bingo, the doors reopen on the first floor. Like every other lift, there is a lift call button outside that can reopen the doors if the lift is still on the same level. I experienced a point where the lift doors would keep opening and closing on the 1st floor, as I tried to press 3rd floor each time. It’s like someone was there pressing the lift call button outside, but when the lift doors opened, nobody was there. \n\nI then decided to use the stairs. Climbing to the 3rd floor, upon my arrival, the lift doors open. So now the lift worked and went up. The moment I got out of the lift, the lift followed me up to the 3rd floor while nobody was there. It was quite a spooky experience that made me wonder. \n\nBut last night was something else. We closed early on a Sunday but I decided to stay longer for a few hours to get some stock checking done, and everyone had left by then. It was just me and the building. And don’t think the place has felt this eery before. In the past I’ve always stayed behind for a few more hours, but everything seemed fine. This time though, the place felt very spooky.\n\nSpooky in the sense that again on the 1st floor, I was waiting for the lift, but the door wouldn’t open so I thought to myself “f**k it, I’m taking the stairs”. During the day when everyone is at work, the lift doesn’t behave like this. \n\nAnd in the stock room, the lighting would weirdly flicker on and off. There was a strange, eery feeling going around. How can I possibly describe it? It seemed like I knew I was alone in the building, but I could sense that “someone or something else is also here”. I never felt such a will to actually leave the building in a hurry. \n\nThe place just doesn’t feel right.",

So I look to the wall of the stairs where I see this semi-huge shadow dog/wolf thing crawl up the stairs at a slow pace at me. I blinked, rubbed my eyes, shook my head but it was still there. I have no idea why a kids mind would make something like this especially when it had no reason to be afraid of fill in any gaps\nThe shadow wolf/dog kept crawling up the stairs, I saw it’s jaw open and close, I could see the rising and falling of its chest.

        "text": "When I (24f) was 16, I almost OD'd, and no one knew. I had spent the night with a friend, and the next morning before getting on the school bus, my friend shared some oval shaped, light green pills with me. She had been told that they were \"like Adderall or Vyvanse.\" So we were expecting it to make us more hyped. She took 1, and I took 3.\n\nI barely remember the school day. I was unable to stay conscious &amp; slept through many class periods. I remember one teacher telling me I needed to stay awake, but he didn't bother me much more than that. I do not know how I made it through the day without someone noticing that something was wrong, because I always stayed awake, payed attention in class, &amp; had good grades. I also barely remember my mom picking my brother &amp; I up from school.\n\nI remember that when I would stand up, my head would start pounding immediately &amp; everything would go white. I would feel an immense pressure through my body, so I had to lay down. I do not know how long I slept. It felt like days. I don't think anyone in my household tried to wake me. They probably just thought I was a normal kind of tired.\n\nSo then I woke up, or at least I thought I did. I got up out of bed, &amp; walked down the hall and into the kitchen to get something to eat or a glass of water. I saw my mom washing dishes &amp; my grandma cooking. And then I woke up in bed again. \n\nThinking I was actually awake this time, I repeat. Get out of bed, walk to the kitchen, see mom &amp; grandma in the same places, wake up.\n\nThis went on several more times. I started to become aware around the 6th repeat that I was stuck in a loop, so I tried to change it by speaking. It felt like I was so tired and slow. I said, \"Mom... I think I'm hallucinating...\" She turned halfway around, but not towards me, and I woke up again. \n\nFor the last time I walked to the kitchen, and this time there was a woman I did not recognize standing behind my mom. She had a long, dark blonde/light brown braid of hair down to her lower back. She appeared to be in her 40s or 50s. I don't remember saying anything, but feeling like saying \"Help me.\" She turned around and smiled at me, then walked to me and hugged me. She said, \"It's okay. It's going to be okay.\" And I felt like she was telling me it wasn't time for me to die.\n\nThen I really actually woke up. My head still pounded, I was still very tired, but I was alive and able to stay awake. I got up, walked to the kitchen, &amp; my mom and grandma were still in the same places, washing dishes and cooking. \n\nI do not know who she was, but she seemed to care about me. I felt love and empathy from her. I truly believe she was a spirit who kept me from dying, \nand I have not touched any pills since, except the occasional ibruprofen. I have thought about this many times over the years, that maybe she is an ancestor, someone I knew in a past life, or guardian spirit. Just guesses though of course! I would love to hear others' ideas on this!\n\nI have to mention also that I later identified the pills I took by looking up the letters &amp; numbers on them. I cannot remember what they are called anymore. But I do remember that you were NOT supposed to take more than one per day. And I took 3. So that was a terrible mistake on my part, which I was lucky to have learned from since I lived. Don't EVER take something when you don't know what it is, even if someone else supposedly knows.",

        "text": "When I first moved into my home, I thought it was wonderful. I live in an apartment complex-and I haven't spoken with any other people living in the complex. \n\nIt first started by hearing creaks and noises here and there. Originally, i thought it was my cats(i have 5), but now I'm becoming paranoid\n\nEvery night starting from 2 weeks ago, I hear the locks on my door(i have 2 different types of locks, two of them are just regular locks and the other is a chain lock) almost like someone is using a lockpick. Every time I get up to go see the door, it's perfectly fine besides the bottom lock is slightly turned. I look under the door, nothing there. It's gotten so bad I picked up a knife once in fear.\n\nI tried to look for some sort of thing I could connect the noise to or give me some reassurance besides my cats, but the only thing that came to mind is a psycho downstairs neighbor, beings that they talked to the landlord regarding me and noise disturbance-but that just seems unreasonable. I've resorted to sleeping in the same room as my mom for comfort, but I can't say it works that well since her hearing is wacky, (I strongly believe she chooses to hear what she wants to hear, as someone has accidentally walked into our apartment and she didn't even notice) and shes a very heavy sleeper\n\nSo I've been thinking about other weird or strange events that happened in this home, and I've been strangely coming back to a few events\n\n1: my kitchen is guarded off, it's like a miniature hallway and while you're fully in the kitchen, you can only see out the two sides(the door and the dining room.) There is also an open storage closet in the center of the home which alines with the bathroom. \n\nOne time, I was in the kitchen and heard some weird noises, so I decided to look out the side where the dining room was. I looked at the storage closet, and I saw a shadow in the shape of a short human, and the bathroom lights were on with the door open, I immediately freaked out. My mom and sister were out somewhere at the time, so I was alone. I stayed in the kitchen, though, and waited until they both came back. At some point, I looked away, and It disappeared. I told my sister when I came back, but it was just played off\n\n2: Another kitchen one, though I'm pretty sure this was just my imagination, although it is a little worrying if it is. \n\nTo make it short and simple, I was in the kitchen on my phone, and I looked up and turned to the side(where the front door is.) I saw a black blurry figure poking its head out at me, then quickly moving away. I went over to that area, and nothing was there. I told my sister she was slightly weirded out, but not by much. \n\nThat's the most important event I remember. Others were just creepy noises like footsteps, things dropping, opening noises, etc. I told my sister most of these, but she never seemed to be bothered. This is my 2nd night, where I was actually able to sleep. Other nights, I was too paranoid. It's to the point where I hate the weekends and I much rather be at school than home.\n\n What do I do? What can I do? Any explanations?",
