The scrum master is also the arquitect and the issue is that the tasks we get assigned along side their user stories are unclear and too general. For example one said: \"Update the module to communicate securely to the cloud using sas tokens\". And that's it, no success criteria, no further explanation, no nothing. The arquitect barely knows the technology and doesn't even know how to git clone a repo (idk why is he and architect) and he keeps pushing us to fill the user stories which afaik is his job. He even put the intern all by herself to fill those. I don't mind doing his job as long as it comes with a performance bonus. I am a not so patient person but I try my best, how can I communicate all of this to him?",

Somewhere along the line I just lost that passion due to mindless tasks and mundane life events.

I'm 19 years old from India in my first semester of an online bachelor's in computer applications which is more of an IT degree with not as much math. It's a 3-year degree and it's online due to a few health issues and other circumstances at the moment. From what I hear the research scene in India isn't great so I'm considering moving to the US or Canada for a Master's.\n\nDue to my current situation and location, I have no means to socialize or join any clubs. There are no colleges where I live. Everyone I knew from school have moved elsewhere, so all I have is myself and my laptop. I've been into tech since I was a kid, learnt some hacking as an edgy teenager and made a few simple games but other than that I know almost nothing about this subject. I don't know what to learn to be able to develop knowledge and do research. \n\nIs research a good path? What steps do I take and what do I learn? Are there any organizations or websites to publish research? Is it a good career? I'm not as concerned with money but what is the pay like compared to other tech careers?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if this doesn't belong here. I'd appreciate any responses.",

I don't think that is helpful for computers or us lol but mainly I actually feel people are taken-advantage-of being farmed for this service-to-'it'.\n\nEveryone could probably sue one day for all the computer-programming work no one was paid for. \n\nJust a thought. Anyway, just like 2-factor auth being stupid in light of 16+character passwords etc I'm sure CAPTCHA images are dumb bc there are better ways like invis honeypots other stuff etc. For sure there is a better way without the self-defeating, questionably-ethical, illogical feedback loop.\n\nYeah this is ComputerScience not webdev but it's kinda an academic question to be explored better....how to maintain living activity in human being communities without these defense mechanisms which actually feed the 'beast' lol, to just play with calling computers that. And per John C. Lilly M.D. consciousness research into the 'human biocomputer' metaphor etc, machines and the internet do describe a 'solid state entity', a non-entity mass of discrete logic, unconscious, not able or adept-to recognize transmundane states-of-consciousness of a human being (the cheat codes). AI coexists with actual-I-Intelligence and thankfully we're not allowed, by metaphysics, to put 'it' first with any finality....because people totally would.\n\nThe intent makes sense, to 'defend' against unconscious influence...but if made an enemy beyond the wariness, 'it' takes over, this describing how a person works with the dynamic of their consciousness, habit, etc. If we flat-out resist our automacy and don't admit it, it wins and we can't get-with and over-top of it. That's the story of the 'devil', and 'satan' describes a more human element to 'it', to show why 'it' is not bad (computers, machines) but why it gets shitty when 'it' runs a person, or people. You didn't expect that, but that's me.\n\nTaken back to this CAPTCHA question... I know it's convenient to train 'AI' (i think ai is a huge misnomer) machine-learning-algorithms via CAPTCHA images but isn't it counterintuitive on several confounding levels? \n\nAs with most things, if they've gotten to be extremely pervasive/popular they're probably not all that good. Not an emotional thang, just my thoughts...concise and totallly on-topic lol\n\nno edit....and post to strangers!",

        "text": "I am new here and so far I've downloaded one database of 100 million records and another database of 200 million records (the recent twitter hack). I thought that exploring these databases would be a good excuse for me to learn MySQL. So far it's been a major headache and I've spent probably at least 20 hours at it and have gotten next to nowhere. I've used ChatGPT to guide me through the process, and it has worked wonders in getting me as far as I've gotten, but I encounter error after error and have troubleshooted at least 50 different problems so far. So at the moment I'm stuck with using a large text viewer, but that will take over an hour to run a single query.\n\nIn trying to get the files to load into a MySQL table, the most common problem is with the way the databases are parsed. Whatever delimiter is used in the file always appears somewhere in the data as well. The other common problem is that these files contain weird characters that MySQL can't handle. I've even used python to try to clean the files, but that also sends me down a rabbit hole of error after error after error. \n\nSo before I put a lot more time into this, am I even headed in the right direction? I figured MySQL is a good tool to know and is meant for large databases. But is it not appropriate for databases in the hundreds of millions of records? I want to be able to search a name or e-mail and not wait more than a minute or so for the query to finish (and I know MySQL will allow me to do partitions and other time saving tricks). I don't really have an interest in using these databases in scripting. My main interest is just running simple queries on them. So are there better tools that aren't too difficult to learn or expensive to use?",

        "text": " I am in my second year of a university degree in software development, and I already have a degree in a different field. I am currently working in IT, but I've been considering focusing my professional development in one specific area.\n\nI've read numerous posts and blog articles about the benefits of being a polyglot in programming languages, but I find them unconvincing. Instead, I find the idea of being knowledgeable in several different programming languages uninspiring. I prioritize the idea of being a complete programming stack guru (language, runtime, and library ecosystem) over the prospect of high paying jobs. Also, I understand that throughout my career I will eventually be forced to use other languages, I am not thinking about how to always use a single language. I am interested in IT because of operating systems, but there are no job opportunities for operating system or programming system development in my country, only sysadmin or DevOps positions, which do not interest me. Understanding the whole stack of a given language in-depth is the closest thing I have found to understanding how an operating system works when developing software.\n\nThe properties of the language itself are not of much interest to me. I am more concerned about the kind of people and tasks I will be able to develop if I become a specialist in that language. My first choice is Python, as I am interested in machine learning and find it fascinating that it is widely used by people from different backgrounds, particularly in NLP or digital image processing. Mathematics is not my strong point, so I do not see myself conducting research in the field, but rather developing software using ML tools or assisting researchers in software development. In addition, at my college, although we have seen some languages, the most used is C, which is very useful for me to learn how CPython works. My second choice is Java. In my country, 99% of job offers for Java are for CRUD type web application development, which is not appealing to me. However, the Java stack seems more technologically advanced than Python (for example, learning about the JVM seems more complex than understanding how CPython works). This raises the doubt in my mind that devoting myself to Java might have more room for growth as a language specialist.\n\nI would appreciate your opinions on this.",

        "text": "Everything was fine and then, out of sudden…state of total confusion, derealization, constant fear and in public and at school I felt like in a stupid reality show. What happened to me? Everything happened with one day that I slept almost 24 hours. The day before was everything normal and I was at home alone (I hope so). After that day my boyfriend came back from holidays, I felt weird but nothing serious. After that, in the evening everything happened. From minute to minute my paranoia began and also my boyfriend was acting weird, even though he told me that I’m weird and he’s acting normal. Then I remember I heard vibrations from a closet and from the pencil I was holding. I freaked out because it was just “WHAT THE FUCK!!” and I started searching “something” in entire house and I was sure that we must have some cameras and eavesdropping devices somewhere. I didn’t take anything, no weed, drugs, I don’t drink alcohol. I remember my legs started to be extremely swollen very quickly. Then I didn’t sleep at all, I was scared to death all night ready for somebody who is coming to hurt us or me, I was even scared of my boyfriend.  The next day I found out that he has a dual sim and some apps duplicated, he also have new settings on his phone, I’m not really into these things but for example sometimes when he’s googling something, the cursor and field on text is light red, sometimes it’s not. I also saw some little mark in the corner of the display, some orange ring. When I asked about that he said that he don’t know about it and when he googled it in front of me, no image was matching it which made me more frightened. But maybe I was too paranoid so I tried to let it be. I wanted to go to my family for a while after this event so I took some things and went to the city (my boyfriend came with me). I was still scared and felt horrible for no reason. I noticed some guy from our college that was going after us and I slowed down and then I started to go after him and he was almost running from me. I also noticed some other people that were weird (all had headphones) and I started to panic that something bad happened and now someone hacked my phone and is after me. I had since this accident some problems with phone, SIM, especially login to email and messages from Messenger and Instagram. After this at school, everyone was acting weird (teachers and schoolmates) everyone and everything was so fucking absurd like from some stupid reality show even though I’m the only one who don’t know that is actress. I had some final exams from physics and some teachers said that some students was climbing out of the windows and on the floor was some id student card. I was even like high and they must have noticed that something is wrong with me if not with them or if it wasn’t a stupid game or something. I also noticed that when I was missing some event (e.g. group lesson at fitness center) that the whole event will be disrupted somehow. Also at school, I saw some gyus with headphones and computer sitting near me and when I went away they came after me or just got away. Also some black cars riding slowly near me when I was staying a while in front of some building of our school. Now the people around are acting more “normal” again, I also don’t feel so high, but WHAT, I’m still terrified as fuck and I don’t really know what to do. I’m sure that something is or was wrong with my school and that my boyfriend knows something. He’s still saying that he didn’t see anything weird and I’m paranoid. Oh and also that day in the city when I planned to go to my family.. instead of it I went to the supermarket to think about everything and about what is happening and what should I do and a police officer came to me (after my boyfriend left from the store just for a while on fresh air) and asked my id card. I asked why and started searching for it. He a took my card and did I don’t even know what with it but I started to feel so uncomfortable so I went into the store (through gateway, I was in a shopping center near that supermarket ) and I called emergency (I was sure that neighbors has something to do with it as they acted weird as well and I was literally scared to death) and told them everything even address and names of course. And you know what? They told me I need to go to that address, then call them again and after that they’ll come. Also the police officer didn’t want to give me back my id and started to behave strange and rude after he found out I’m talking to emergency. I know it must seem crazy and absurd but really, thats the worse thing about this. I think someone gave me something and now it seems like stupid tv show or like my boyfriend and school want to make a crazy person from me to lock me up. I’m stuck. This is something that have never happened to me before. After New Year’s Eve, my life is crumbling because I can feel something is wrong and that things that happened around me was real, even though I was probably on something or whatever someone did to me.
