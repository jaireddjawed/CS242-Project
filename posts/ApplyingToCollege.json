I hear you. I am here for you. And so are others. If you're not feeling that support, please look for it beyond your immediate boundaries.\n\nIf you\u2019re queer, trans, nonbinary, genderfluid, or otherwise LGBQTQ, I have no doubt you are more than aware of the anti-trans legislation sweeping across the US in record numbers this spring. And for those of you reading who aren\u2019t trans or queer or nonbinary or lgbtq+ and you feel like you\u2019re sick of reading about all these transgender issues, well, guess what? We  \u2013 and I include myself as an ally\/accomplice\/mom to a transgender daughter \u2013 are sick of talking about it. Since 2021, in the US, there\u2019s been a record number of anti-LGBTQ+ bills filed -- almost half of those anti-trans. In the first 3 1\/2 months of 2023 alone, there have been over 400 pieces of anti-trans legislation at the state level. Currently (as of March 5, 2023), there are 432 bills geared toward anti-trans legislation in 41 states. These are scary times for our trans brothers and sisters and non-binary and genderqueer siblings. [This NBC news article highlights the worries, thoughts, and feelings so many trans students and their parents and loved ones are feeling about moving forward in their lives.](https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/politics\/politics-news\/students-switch-college-plans-states-pass-anti-lgbtq-laws-rcna67875) It\u2019s not fair that during what should be one of the most exciting journeys of your lives, you\u2019re forced to add anti-trans state legislation, fear of hate crimes, and hostile rhetoric to your long list of things you should be worried about as a teenager who\u2019s applying to college, like applications, essays, testing, course rigor, and acceptances.\n\nI mean, applying to college is stressful enough, but worrying about whether a state is actively legislating against you and whether a college will have your back can make it especially tough. Like everything college admissions, I encourage you to ask questions and learn as much as possible about admissions, campus safety, and the culture and vibe on campus. See, even in these dark days, by taking some time and learning more with intention, you can find a space where you can thrive. Many college campuses are overwhelmingly supportive spaces, and you can find places to grow and live the life you want to live. But your safety comes first.\n\nSo, I think, first and foremost, you must find schools that are in safe states and that openly accept queer students. And I think you should consider being open about it in your application \u2014 especially if you\u2019re trans and planning to transition while in college \u2014 using the additional information section to explain your situation, whether you\u2019ve already transitioned, for the most part, are in the process, or are planning to in the future. Trans students have to be aware of some practical concerns that could have an effect on their college experience, like the dorm and bathroom situation. Are you applying with a transcript of one gender but know you plan to transition while in college? In that case, you might want to look for schools that have mixed-gender floors and bathrooms.\n\nMany liberal arts colleges are particularly safe and welcoming to the queer community, where you can fully embrace your queer and trans joy. You can find out by snooping around their website, going on a visit and asking students or the admissions office, or checking out their LGBTQ clubs and groups online and seeing how active they are. If you can visit, definitely stop by and check any services or LGBTQ+ centers they may have for you. Or reach out to them online or by phone. Ask if there is one; if there\u2019s not, that might be a sign that the school wouldn\u2019t be particularly welcoming.\n\n# \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\u26a7\ufe0fYou Need To Start Here \u2013 State Laws:\n\nNow \u2013 more than ever \u2013 it\u2019s essential for you to not only look into how accommodating the college is for you as a trans or queer student but also it\u2019s necessary to investigate the state laws. As of right now, March 5, 2023, these states appear not to have any current legislation against trans or other queer students, so for now,[ I\u2019m using this list from Erin Reed](https:\/\/open.substack.com\/pub\/erininthemorn\/p\/second-period-anti-trans-legislative?r=ldeg9&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email), who\u2018s on Instagram as u\/ErinInTheMorning and TikTok and Twitter as u\/Erininthemorn to create my lists of  \u201cSafest and Safer States.\u201d I subscribe to Erin\u2019s substack email list, where she sends super helpful information. If you\u2019re a parent, advocate, or loved one, I recommend subscribing to her email list. She gives amazing up-to-date news, insight, and info.\n\nA note: These are tumultuous times, and this list could easily \u2013 and quickly \u2013 change:\n\n**SAFEST STATES:**\n\nWashington, Oregon, California, Colorado, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Washington DC, New Mexico, Minnesota\n\n**SAFE STATES:**\n\nNevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Maine, Rhode Island\n\n**WORST ACTIVE ANTI-TRANS LAWS:**\n\nTEXAS, TENNESSEE, FLORIDA, Utah, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama \u2013 and I\u2019d also steer clear of Kentucky, Indiana, West Virginia, North Dakota, Montana, and Idaho\n\n**More info and resources about State Laws:** From [u\/McNeilAdmissions](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/McNeilAdmissions\/): here's a resource you can use to get a picture of the legal landscape: [LGBTMAP.org](https:\/\/lgbtmap.org\/) provides an overview of hate crime laws across the US with detailed data if you click thru: [https:\/\/www.lgbtmap.org\/equality-maps\/hate\\_crime\\_laws](https:\/\/www.lgbtmap.org\/equality-maps\/hate_crime_laws)\n\n* More places to research state laws and legislation:\n   * [https:\/\/www.transformationsproject.org\/legislation](https:\/\/www.transformationsproject.org\/legislation)\n   * [https:\/\/translegislation.com\/](https:\/\/translegislation.com\/)\n   * [https:\/\/transgenderlawcenter.org\/equalitymap](https:\/\/transgenderlawcenter.org\/equalitymap)\n   * [https:\/\/freedomforallamericans.org\/legislative-tracker\/anti-transgender-legislation\/](https:\/\/freedomforallamericans.org\/legislative-tracker\/anti-transgender-legislation\/)\n   * [https:\/\/www.aclu.org\/legislation-affecting-lgbtq-rights-across-country](https:\/\/www.aclu.org\/legislation-affecting-lgbtq-rights-across-country)\n\n# \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\u26a7\ufe0f Suggested Trans-Friendly Colleges:\n\nI\u2019ve heard from trans students or parents of trans students that these colleges are Trans Friendly in the states listed above (who do NOT have anti-trans legislation currently passed or pending (as always, you must do your own research here \u2013 things are changing quickly). I\u2019m always looking for more suggestions, so please feel free to make suggestions based on your research or your experiences. Sadly, Louisiana, Virginia, Nebraska, and Ohio all have current anti-trans legislation pending or passed, eliminating some of my favorite colleges to suggest on this list:\n\nMassachusetts: Babson, Tufts, U Mass Amherst, Clark U, Hampshire College, Northeastern, Simmons, Smith, Wheaton College, MIT, Harvard, Brandeis, Boston U\n\nNew York: Ithaca College, Vassar, SUNY New Paltz, Bard, The New School, Sarah Lawrence, Skidmore, NYU, Columbia, Barnard\n\nNew Jersey: Rutgers, Princeton\n\nConnecticut: U Conn, Wesleyan, Yale\n\nRhode Island: Brown\n\nVermont: UVM, Bennington, Champlain\n\nIllinois: Knox, Augustana, UIUC\n\nMaryland: Goucher\n\nWisconsin: Lawrence, Beloit\n\nColorado: CU Boulder, Fort Collins, U Denver\n\nWashington: Washington State, U Washington, Evergreen, U Puget Sound, Western Washington, Whitman\n\nOregon: U Oregon, Pacific U Oregon, Oregon State, Lewis and Clark, Reed\n\nCalifornia: Claremont McKenna, Pitzer, USC, UC Santa Barbara, Occidental, UCLA, Cal, UCSC, Editing to add: UC Riverside, and to take a look at UC Irvine and UC Davis and some of the CSUs (based on feedback in comments)\n\nMinnesota: Macalester\n\nArizona: Northern Arizona U\n\nPennsylvania: Allegheny, Swarthmore\n\n# \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\u26a7\ufe0fSIX Tips for Trans, Nonbinary, and Genderqueer Applicants:\n\n**1. SELF\u2013CARE:** First and foremost, please take care of yourself. Here\u2019s what I know: Trans people are magic. Embrace your joy, your sense of who you are, your ability to see beyond the binary, and the ways you understand the world around you. I know it feels awful and overwhelming and scary right now \u2013 I\u2019m truly scared right now, but you are so much more than that fear. [I have lots of posts about mindfulness and dealing with the stress of college admissions, and some of that will work for you for sure if you allow yourself to try it](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/nm9ywc\/if_youre_feeling_stressed_out_about_college\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). But, my number one piece of advice to you to make it through these roughest of times is to hold on to you who you are, embrace your joy, share your magic, and know that there are people out there who love you and care about you even if you don\u2019t know them \u2013 and you are not alone. Hug your loved ones \u2013even if it\u2019s just a teddy bear. Find someone to talk to in a safe space. Parents and caretakers, show your kids you are there for them. Talk to them. Hug them.\n\n**2. Keep up with the forms:** While many colleges ask for your preferred name, you may still need to use your birth name if it hasn\u2019t been legally changed yet so that all your paperwork and files won\u2019t get lost or disorganized. A note from an A2C parent of 2 transgender students, u\/teresajs: \u201cIf you choose to use your preferred name (on your application and\/or at college), your college may use that name when contacting your parents. For instance, I've gotten emails from colleges my youngest child applied to that used their preferred name and had a student employee call from my eldest's college during a fund drive who used their preferred name. If you aren't out to your family, you may not want to officially use a preferred name at school. The method for asking for gender-neutral housing, signing up to use a preferred name, and getting support is different at each school. In most cases, the best point of contact seems to be the school's LGBTQ+ organization.\u201d\n\n**3. Reach out to the School\u2019s LGBTQ+\/Campus Pride Organization. Ask questions. Educate yourselves about the environment on and around campus:**\n\n* Have they had instances of anti-trans, anti-queer, anti-gay violence or bullying?\n* How do queer and trans students mix with others?\n* What kind of support do they provide for your community, especially during these tumultuous times?\n\n**4. Think about your Essays:** To come out or not to come out? You don\u2019t have to write about being trans or gay or queer etc, in your essays, but you certainly can if it\u2019s a story you want to tell. If you\u2019re worried it might hurt you in admissions, ask yourself this question: Do I want to attend a college that would deny me because of who I am? Below, I\u2019ve linked to College Essays Guy\u2019s great posts that are based on a workshop he held last summer that I attended.\n\n**5. Research Sources to Find LGBTQ + Friendly Colleges:** In addition to websites like Campus Pride Index, make sure you research more local sources and like I\u2019m a broken record, I\u2019m gonna say it again, make sure you\u2019re researching state laws:\n\n* Local LGBTQ+ Center: [https:\/\/www.lgbtcenters.org\/LGBTCenters](https:\/\/www.lgbtcenters.org\/LGBTCenters)\n* Local PFLAG chapter: Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) --  [https:\/\/pflag.org\/find-a-chapter](https:\/\/pflag.org\/find-a-chapter)\n* Campus Centers -- [https:\/\/www.lgbtcampus.org\/find-an-lgbtq-campus-center](https:\/\/www.lgbtcampus.org\/find-an-lgbtq-campus-center)\n* [City Rankings -- Municipal Equality Index 2020 - HRC](https:\/\/www.hrc.org\/resources\/municipal-equality-index)\n* School Participation in local pride events\n* College\u2019s Mission Statement\n* LGBTQ+ Campus Groups that are funded by the school\n* If possible, visit the school and meet with the LBGTQ+ groups and organizations.\n\n**6. Talk to Admissions. Ask Questions:** Be sure to ask colleges these kinds of questions when doing your research or reaching out or on tours\/visits\/info sessions:\n\n* Do they have sexual identity and gender-inclusive housing?\n* Do they have a nondiscrimination policy for trans\/queer students?\n* Do they allow students to change their names on campus records?\n* What resources and opportunities do they have to support trans\/queer students?\n* Do the schools\u2019 health clinics and health plans cover trans medical care if that\u2019s something you are interested in?\n\n# \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\u26a7\ufe0f10 College Campus Red Flags for LGBTQ+ Students and Allies\n\n[Here\u2019s the link to the doc. ](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1RkN8fgY0LwaB9gX3c1utRw72-sb59h1q\/view?usp=sharing)from ([collegetorch.com](https:\/\/www.collegetorch.com\/)).\n\n1.

More thoughts and resources:\n\nAs far as writing about it, that will be up to you. My suggestion is to use the Additional Info section if you feel like there are issues you\u2019ve had or any circumstances that have affected your application because of being trans, nonbinary, or genderqueer. But I def don\u2019t think there\u2019s any harm in discussing who you are in your essay, either.\n\nTo me, if a college didn\u2019t want to accept me for an essential part of who I am, then I wouldn\u2019t want to go there. So, I ask you, why would you want to go to a college that wouldn\u2019t accept you simply because you\u2019re trans, gender non-conforming, gay, or another gender or sexual minority?\n\n**More Resources:**\n\n1.

When my daughter came out as trans in 2018, I\u2019d worked with a couple of kids here on A2C and tried to help them work through issues with applications, but I hadn\u2019t spent a lot of time researching or learning. I\u2019m starting to learn, and while I\u2019m thrilled that there are so many resources available, the hurdles to applying to college as a trans, nonbinary, or genderqueer applicant seem to be growing. I try to attend as many NACAC, IECA, and HECA webinars as possible. And I\u2019m trying to follow as many transgender supporting activists as possible to keep up with the barrage of legislation to share with you. However, there\u2019s still so much to learn, and the circumstances are constantly changing \u2013 and growing more and more challenging literally by the day. So, please, as you\u2019re learning about resources and hints and tips, share them below! I\u2019ll be sure to add them in.

Look, I know this week and the next couple of weeks are gonna feel just super fucked up and shitty for a lot of you. I wish I could wave a magic wand and make it all better and make college admissions somehow feel fair and like they make sense, but I haven't discovered that power in me yet, so I'm gonna stick with providing as much information as I possibly can for those who want it and can use it. Here's the deal: If you've been waitlisted, you have some decisions to make... Let's get started!\n\nIMPORTANT PSA ABOUT YOUR PHONE: If you accept or have accepted waitlist positions, be sure that your phone is charged and working and that you can accept voicemails. And be sure that the number they have is one you will be checking. Often colleges will call you about a waitlist offer before they email you or text you, so they need to be able to reach you. You don\u2019t have to answer in the middle of your English Lit or Calc class, but you do want them to be able to leave a voicemail. Also, make sure to read random texts and check spam and junk email folders fairly regularly. Don\u2019t check it obsessively. That\u2019s not healthy.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79A note: I know for some of you, getting that waitlist decision is incredibly painful. It is, in lots of ways, a soft rejection, and I believe that\u2019s by far the healthiest way to look at it, but that\u2019s also what makes it sting even more. So, be sure to take care of yourself. Give yourself some grace and time to process and adjust if you need to. I\u2019ll be writing more about caring for yourself emotionally in the incoming weeks as we start feeling the full brunt force of decisions, but here are a couple of my posts from the fall that might help you through your feelings now.\n\n[You can handle this. College decision time is hard -- and it really sucks sometimes, but you're gonna grow stronger. Find your inner tree and inner lotus -- and be a good person.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/rdhia6\/you_can_handle_this_college_decision_time_is_hard\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[It\u2019s time for emotional planning. Spoiler Alert: You\u2019re gonna be ok.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/r8sjp7\/happy_weekend_beautiful_seniors_if_you_applied\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n# \u2753ABOUT THE WAITLIST: THE LOWDOWN\n\nI don\u2019t know about y\u2019all, but I just have this sneaky feeling we are gonna have another big ole humongo pile of waitlists this year, just like last year and the year before that. Colleges just don\u2019t have any way to predict their enrollments because of the way everything has been upended in the past couple of years and the huge waves of applications that have continued to happen at So. Many. Colleges.\n\nAs they did in the past couple of years, I think many will try to manage their yield and freshmen classes with the waitlist -- and I know y\u2019all are beginning to feel the effects of that now. [Rick Clark, Director of College Admission at Georgia Tech,](https:\/\/sites.gatech.edu\/admission-blog\/2021\/02\/25\/predicting-yield-in-2021-everyone-shorts-it\/)[ said](https:\/\/sites.gatech.edu\/admission-blog\/2021\/02\/25\/predicting-yield-in-2021-everyone-shorts-it\/) a couple of years ago, \u201cRight now, admission and enrollment leaders around the country are obsessing over the models they developed to predict student \u201cyield\u201d behavior. They are looking back at pre-pandemic information and weighing that against 2020, in addition to praying more, sleeping less, and stretching out to make the \u201cleap.\u201d You should read the whole linked blog post, by the way.\n\nWe did see a wave of applicants get accepted off waitlists in both 2020 and 2021 and even in 2022, but that was a new trend. Usually, I say think of it as a gentle rejection -- and I still do for the most part. So, although I encourage you to be proactive if that school is one you\u2019re truly interested in (read what to do below), you still need to move forward and embrace the colleges who have shown you love and accepted you (or find some if you don't have them). You can do both at the same time. While you\u2019re reading Rick Clark\u2019s blog, make sure you read his latest: [The Two Most Important Letters in College Admission](https:\/\/sites.gatech.edu\/admission-blog\/).  If you\u2019re not sure what they are, he says they\u2019re IP. Institutional Priorities \u2013 If you\u2019re not sure what that entails, you definitely need to read his blog to get a better understanding of your college decisions. \n\nOne of our former moderators here on A2C, [u\/LRFE](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/LRFE\/), had a [great post about what the waitlist is and what it all means](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/fmgs7e\/waitlists_101_everything_you_need_to_know\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). I\u2019m just gonna copy and paste some of it here (with some of my revisions):\n\n\u201cColleges use a waitlist mainly to manage yield and class size. They have an idea of how many students they want in the class and admit some amount that will end up being around the class size. However, since they can't predict yield perfectly, they sometimes turn to the waitlist to fill up the rest of their class. Colleges often have an FAQ about waitlists or an FAQ that answers questions about waitlists. It varies from college to college: do your own research... Schools often release some statistics on waitlist acceptance rates: for example, Amherst states 500 people accept their waitlist spot, and on average, accept 20 per year.\u201d\n\nBe sure to check out the Common Data Set for any info that\u2019s been shared about waitlists from the years prior. How many did they waitlist? How many did they take off? Be sure to [Check out my YouTube chat with Marcella De Laurentiis](https:\/\/youtu.be\/qdf7EeOYG6E), aka [u\/Novembrr](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/novembrr\/), where we talked about how to use the Common Data Set and just about waitlists more generally. She shared so much amazing information, and if you're writing a LOCI, I **highly recommend you watch it so** you can learn from her as she answered questions from students like you. \n\nDO NOT STAY DEVOTED TO YOUR WAITLIST COLLEGE(S): Just like with admissions -- it\u2019s ok to hope for the best, but you need to expect the worst. Maybe it's just my Gen X brain (I'm not quite a boomer), but in my experience, \"Manifesting\" just isn't gonna cut it when it comes to admissions once the application is in and the LOCI is written for a waitlist. As [u\/chumpydo](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/chumpydo\/) so wisely commented, \u201cSubmit your LOCI and then treat it like a rejection. You might be surprised in the future, but just don\u2019t even consider it an option because statistically, it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFALL IN LOVE WITH AN ACCEPTANCE: Fall in love (or strong like) with at least one of your acceptances. Learn as much as you can about them through various virtual visit sites: hang out on their webpages, follow their social media, and do their tours and info sessions. I love this idea from [u\/yourfriendgumby](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/yourfriendgumby\/): Make a class schedule so you can see all the cool courses they offer!\n\nWAITLISTS AREN\u2019T BINDING: You can accept spots on as many waitlists as you like. You can stick with the school where you\u2019ve deposited (and you do need to pick one to deposit to unless you\u2019re sure you want a gap year or to attend community college) or choose to attend your waitlisted school, but more than likely, you\u2019ll lose your deposit at the college where you\u2019ve accepted a spot -- and you should accept a spot somewhere.\n\nCOMMIT TO ANOTHER SCHOOL: And when I say commit, I mean send in your money when the time comes that you need to do so, and also emotionally and mentally commit. Accept a place from one of your acceptances where you\u2019ve fallen in love (or strong like or you can see yourself there) by the May 1 deadline or whatever your accepted college\u2019s deadline is. Mentally Move On. Once you\u2019ve made your deposit at a college, if your waitlist college comes along with some great news and you decide you want to pivot that way, then you just accept that spot and let the college where you\u2019ve committed know. It\u2019s common -- it\u2019s called Melt, and colleges expect it. You will more than likely, though, lose that deposit. (An aside: Don\u2019t let go of your accepted spots before the deadline unless you are 100 percent sure that you won\u2019t attend. Be doubly sure that all finances are gonna work out before you let go of spots.)\n\nYOU STILL HAVE CHOICES: If you don\u2019t have a school you\u2019re ready to commit to, there are still lots of amazing schools accepting applications. [Check out this post with some awesome colleges that are still accepting apps.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/10bqf25\/hey_seniors_if_youre_not_happy_with_your_college\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) I\u2019ll be making an updated post with colleges that are still open within the next couple of weeks. (Or you could also decide to do a gap year or start at community college -- all great choices.)\n\nKEEP UP YOUR GRADES: You need to be keeping those grades up so that if the waitlist goes on into the summer and you want to stay on the list, you\u2019ll be able to send them an update showing that you\u2019re still going strong.\n\nDON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID AT SCHOOL OR ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL: If trouble finds you or you find trouble, I'm pretty sure that the waitlist offer won't be extended, and yes, you'll have to be honest.\n\n# \ud83d\udc8c WRITING THE WAITLIST LOVE LETTER LOCI\n\n**Read the waitlist letter:** Be sure to carefully read the waitlist letter from your college and see if they are even open to a LOCI. If they are and you decide you still want to take a spot on the waitlist, this WL-LOCI is your chance, so write the love letter of your life during the next couple of weeks. Hint -- maybe don\u2019t wait for Ivy Day to write your WL-LOCI for colleges where you\u2019ve been waitlisted now. I don\u2019t know if it makes a difference or not, quite frankly, but it\u2019s good to get moving on those letters and let those colleges know how important they are to you.\n\nRead the waitlist letter and any waitlist FAQs on the portal or the webpage: Read the directions carefully that they send you in the waitlist letter or on the portal. I know I\u2019m repeating myself here -- it\u2019s because that\u2019s the most important thing to do. If they don\u2019t say not to send something -- SEND SOMETHING.\n\n**Show Interest:** Attend info sessions, look into their social media, read their school newspaper, devour their website, and let them know in your letter how you have and will connect with the different aspects of their college that they are highlighting. Some thoughts from [u\/Novembrr](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/Novembrr\/) during our Livestream: reach out to a professor or club leader or students you know on campus and talk to them about their experiences on campus so that you can more strongly create a picture of who you'll be on their campus. Your goal is to paint a picture of yourself on their campus.\n\n**Be Honest:** If you will definitely attend if you are admitted, tell them so. If you will jump at the opportunity and IMMEDIATELY accept a spot, let them know. If you are turning down all your other waitlist offers but only keeping theirs, let them know that too. If you\u2019re so interested in attending and you\u2019d consider a gap year or starting the second semester, you should let them know that, too. Don\u2019t lie. Also, if your financial circumstances have changed and you might be able to afford more than you initially applied with, that can be helpful info also.\n\n**Be nice:** Be Positive. Thank them for the continued opportunity to be considered. Don\u2019t complain or whine about being waitlisted in your WL-LOCI. Don\u2019t ask them why you weren\u2019t admitted. Don\u2019t assume you know why you weren\u2019t admitted -- you might end up highlighting an aspect of your application they were overlooking.\n\n**Be yourself:** Just like in your personal essay, use your normal word choices and voice. Be friendly. This is like your chance to sit and have a cup of bubble tea with them, letting them know why y'all are a great match.\n\n**Bare your soul:** Tell them why you are so enamored with them, and give them reasons to be enamored by you. There is no holding back now. This is your time to let it all out. Show them why they need you. You\u2019ve basically got nothing to lose here.\n\n**Create a picture of yourself on their campus:** Draw connections between yourself and the college. Watch all the virtual videos -- especially from their website, read their website and the school newspaper, learn their school motto, and then tie all that into how you are the right person for that campus. Your goal is to create a picture of you on their campus. Show them why they need you and why you need them. Think of this as really the ultimate Why College Love Letter.\n\nFive hundred words are enough: Keep it at around 500 words -- about a page.\n\n**Updates:** Include any updates to your application. You can bullet-point these so they are easier to identify. If you\u2019ve improved any test scores or grades, tell them. If you\u2019ve won awards or competitions since your application or last update, tell them. But updates can be more personal, too; maybe you reached a personal goal of walking 3200 miles, benching 200 pounds, writing one poem a day for six months, winning a game in Fortnite, building toothpick houses, or building a castle out of toothpicks. You can start this paragraph with something like \u201csince my application or my last update....\u201d\n\n**Be Specific:** Describe something specific from a virtual tour, info session, an Instagram story, school newspaper, or even a live tour if you were lucky enough to go on campus. If you haven\u2019t done any of that stuff, do it now. Mention classes, profs, clubs, news, stories -- do your research.\n\n**About the Format:** Most importantly, follow the instructions they send you or share on the portal! If they don\u2019t give clear instructions, here\u2019s what I suggest: Send an email with the text of your LOCI in the email. You can also attach a PDF version, and I suggest uploading a PDF to the portal if they have one. You don't need to use some funky colorful font or weird format here. Let your words, your love for the school, and your voice do the work.\n\n**Who:** Unless they say otherwise, address the email to the admissions officer who signed your letter and to your regional admissions officer if you have one. Additionally, copy the email to the general admissions office and the director of admissions, and upload it to your portal if that's available to you. I get lots of questions about whether to include the letter in the text of the email or as a pdf. After doing a little research, I\u2019m suggesting both! You can just say at the end something like, \u201cI\u2019ve attached a pdf of this letter in case it\u2019s easier for you to upload it to my file.\u201d\n\n**When:** If they don't give guidance about their deadline, I advise sending the letter by mid-April and then perhaps a short follow-up in the first or second week of May (again, instructions from the college either in the waitlist letter or on the admissions portal preempt any advice I give, so read everything they send you carefully)\n\n**Find your Inner Elsa:** Still, even after you\u2019ve sent that letter, don\u2019t plan on the waitlist working out \u2014 no matter how much solid soul-bearing you did in your WL-LOCI. Make other plans. Write your letter, send it, be like Elsa, and let it go. Life\u2019s too short to wait around on college acceptances.\n\n# \ud83d\udcdd OTHER INFO YOU MIGHT FIND HELPFUL\n\nUPDATE YOUR INTERVIEWER: Consider updating your interviewer and letting them know. Maybe they have some advice, but either way, it\u2019s a courtesy to them no matter what the decision.\n\nADDITIONAL LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION: Consider sending in one new or an additional letter of recommendation if the school doesn\u2019t say NOT to. I suggest having that letter present a side of you they might not have seen -- maybe from a boss or a club coordinator. When you ask someone to write a LOR for you, be sure to let them know why you're specifically asking them and how important they've been to your personal growth and development (and in which specific ways). Again, read the directions from the college. If they say not to send any additional materials \u2014 don\u2019t.\n\nREACH OUT TO YOUR REGIONAL ADMISSIONS OFFICER: Make sure they know of your interest, but don\u2019t be a bother.\n\nTALK TO YOUR SCHOOL COUNSELOR: Let them know you are planning to pursue the waitlist and ask if they have any helpful suggestions. They could potentially even reach out to the schools for you.\n\nWise Words from [u\/ScholarGrade](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/Scholar\/): \"Actually, send something. Letters of Continued Interest are actually fairly rare, considering the volume of waitlisted students, so your letter will probably be read and considered. Most students take a waitlist as an L and move on. Briefly tell them why you are a great fit for their school and why it's your top choice. A lot of schools consider demonstrated interest, especially for waitlisted or borderline applicants.\"\n\nRead More from [u\/Novembrr](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/novembrr\/) in her post from last year:  [Waitlisted? How to write a LOCI by Novembrr (former Berkeley and UCHicago Admissions Reader)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/mlaaam\/waitlisted_how_to_write_a_loci_by_novembrr_former\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\ntl;dr\n\n* Commit to another school; it\u2019s ok to deposit at one school and then change your mind and let the first college know if you\u2019re accepted off a waitlist and want to attend the waitlisted college. Keep in mind you might lose that deposit. (Also, FYI, you can ask for deposit fee waivers if that's a financial burden for your family)\n* You can wait to deposit at your accepted college on the deadline, so you\u2019re not sending a deposit you might lose if that\u2019s a worry for you.\n* Follow the directions that a waitlist school sends you. If they have specific instructions in the letter or on the portal, do what they say.\n* If you accept a place on a waitlist and want the option to attend, send a LOCI if the school doesn\u2019t advise you not to.\n\n\ud83d\udc96 One last note: I\u2019m here to chat if you want to discuss LOCIs or your feelings. And I know there are tons of others around our amazing A2C ready to give support and advice, too, so please reach out.\n\nXOXO AdmissionsMom","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678643451.0,"comments":[{"author":"Cancel_Helpful","text":"Thank god for the point about voicemail.

We knew we could try, but as realists, we knew it would be unlikely to happen... so we decided to take the heartbreak earlier instead of waiting it out until college. \n\nThe conversation happened a few hours ago even though we knew we *had* to have it ever since we started dating last year.

I'd just like to say that it's a very nuanced discussion where the answer is not always clear.\n\nFor example, [This article](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/magazine\/2021\/06\/28\/college-standardized-tests-optional-sat-act-496127) cites a study saying that removing standardized testing has increased diversity. Yet, this doesn't necessarily mean that this more diverse class is actually more qualified. [This article](http:\/\/hechingerreport.org\/questioning-their-fairness-a-record-number-of-colleges-stop-requiring-the-sat-and-act\/) cites a study showing that the average ACT\/SAT score is significantly higher among higher socioeconomic status families. However, correlation does not imply causation. Maybe the test is just unfair, but maybe because of their wealth these students actually knew more and had been given more training to increase their thinking skills.\n\n[This study](https:\/\/www.aera.net\/Newsroom\/High-School-GPAs-and-ACT-Scores-as-Predictors-of-College-Completion-Examining-Assumptions-about-Consistency-across-High-Schools) and [This article](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/nickmorrison\/2020\/01\/29\/its-gpas-not-standardized-tests-that-predict-college-success\/?sh=165618de32bd) claim that there is no relationship between ACT\/SAT scores and college graduation rate. On the other hand, [This study](https:\/\/www.ucop.edu\/institutional-research-academic-planning\/_files\/sat-act-study-report.pdf) showed a positive correlation between ACT\/SAT scores and success in college classes. For both sides, the same correlation does not imply causation argument applies. Possibly high test scorers went to on average harder universities so experienced lower graduation rates, or possibly they were given special attention by teachers so experienced higher gradation rates.\n\n[This account](https:\/\/mitadmissions.org\/blogs\/entry\/we-are-reinstating-our-sat-act-requirement-for-future-admissions-cycles\/) from MIT, which also cites a number of studies, explains how, in the two years where they went test-optional, they found a less prepared class with lower performance across the board. On the other hand, this was amid the COVID-19 pandemic, so we would expect scores to go down to some degree.\n\nIn conclusion, I think anyone who says blindly and confidently \"standardized tests are good\" or \"standardized tests are bad\" probably need to look deeper into the issue. It's a really complex, nuanced issue which has proven very difficult to objectively study. We can perform *studies* where we look at different metrics, but this at best gives us correlation and guess not objective answers. If we could run an experiment to control for the thousands of variables, ma bye then we could say for certain. But this is simply not possible given the social, long tear dynamic of the issue.\n\nSo all this debating and arguing isn't getting anyone anywhere. If you are deciding for your college whether to go test optional, test blind, or test required, then you should consider this. But for the rest of this, we are throwing around words and not getting anywhere.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678655811.0}]},{"title":"with only 230 students.. how the fuck does Caltech even exist","author":"I_Love_Mango_2026","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/11orduv\/with_only_230_students_how_the_fuck_does_caltech\/","text":"\\^","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678559694.0,"comments":[{"author":"tachyonicinstability","text":"This is especially true of Caltech, but many schools have undergraduate education as a side business.

She did similar things to other students as well. On top of that she has a rounding policy where if you are 3-4% within your target grade range, she goes through old tests and quizzes and gives back points. She applied this to random people, with the reasoning that they showed improvement on tests, even though many of them did not. I really wouldn't have cared unless she applied either of the two to me since a 90% is the cutoff for an A. There were about 15 students who she graded wrong and as a result, we all went independently at separate times to ask her, to which she coldly said no and that we were wasting her time. \n\nThree of us decided to go to our Counselor, who understood our pain, verified the situation and made us talk to two people since she had no control over any part of the situation: the school therapist as well as the Vice Principal. Again, the school therapist understood completely where we were coming from and spoke to the Vice Principal for us telling about how unfair the situation is. The next day, we got pulled out of class to  meet the Vice Principal, and we had to tell him the entire story all over again, and he basically told us that he would speak to the Principal for us and that the California Code Of Education leaves such situations directly up to the teacher. I read the entire California Code Of Education and not once does it say that. We haven't heard anything back, but all of the evidence is sitting with us.

I think NEU has chosen a business model, w acquiring different campuses, structuring it\u2019s co-op class\/work schedule in a way that\u2019s different from most school\u2019s traditional semester or quarter models. Our impression was that this could be really fantastic for students who need to work their way through school in order to pay for it, or for those who just prefer to get into the work force as early as possible. For us personally, we are fortunate enough to be able to afford tuition for a traditional 4 yr school. So when considering NEU, three things shaped our discussions. 1) I think for many people it\u2019s really easy to fall out of the habit of studying, and the start\/stop rhythm of school and full-time work might make it harder to do well or potentially cause students to drop out before finishing. 2) Every job has a learning curve period so it might be difficult or even unhelpful to have to leave a job just when you\u2019re getting good at it. And 3) you have a lifetime to work, so if you don\u2019t *have* to financially, why not stick w a traditional 4 yr school plan and have fun, enjoy your youth, and do internships in the summers.\n\nOur daughter was not impressed with the tour guide who seemed very busy and stressed and had nothing to offer about student life or fun traditions and only talked about things in terms of working and it gave a very stressful vibe w no joy or school spirit. With that, plus our discussion of the 3 points above, she decided not to apply. She also decided not to apply to BU either because of the guide giving a similarly stressed out\/disconnected vibe.\n\nSchool choices are driven by very personal and different criteria for every individual, but all will give you a roughly equal education and job prospects at the end. Think about how you learn, what kind of school experience will make you happy and fit with your financial needs, and go with what feels right for you.

Here\u2019s what you can do to boost your chances of being accepted.\n\n### Get a sense of your chances of admission.\n\n**Contact the admissions office or check the college\u2019s website to find out if the college ranks waitlisted students or if it has a priority list**. Most are willing to let you know your status. The higher you rank on the list, the better your chances are of being accepted.\n\n### Write a letter to the admissions office.\n\n**The college has already decided that you have the academic credentials for admittance. Now\u2019s the time to mention any additional academic or nonacademic factors that might help your case\u2014any new achievements or supplemental information. Emphasize your strong desire and continued interest to attend the college. Make a case for why you're a good fit. You can tell them that you'll enroll if they accept you but only if you're absolutely certain you will enroll.**\n\n### Study hard.\n\nThis is no time to slack off. If you're waitlisted, you may be reevaluated based on your third- and fourth-quarter grades.\n\n### Stay involved.\n\n**Show admissions officers you're committed to sports, clubs, and other activities.** Realize that you've already achieved something.\n\nYou were waitlisted, not turned away. Many students weren\u2019t as successful. Reconsider the colleges that accepted you.\n\nIf you\u2019d be just as happy at one of your other choices, send in a deposit. Plan to attend that college. Then turn down the spot on the waiting list.

They are mandated by the States to graduate as many students as possible adhering to some minimal standards of achievement.\n\nThe majority of Americans didn't attend such schools so the parents and relatives and friends of these kids don't understand the upside of participating in the struggle to try to get in. Most kids are perfectly comfortable knowing they are going to go to one of few State schools where they will get an excellent education and not take on a substantial amount of debt in the process. They are happy to go to colleges where their friends or girlfriends or boyfriends are going. Some will join Frats and Sororities which will further expand their social life which most think is more important than having access to top recruiters.\n\nThere are 3.8 million high school seniors I think that number is fairly accurate and only 15000 are going to matriculate into Ivys, another 12-13K into Elites, and 5K into Top liberal arts colleges. And a 1\/2 of these kids are persons of privilege who have attended Private Day and Boarding schools and had the luxury of the best tutors, test prep and resources money can buy.  For them, college admissions are stressful because it is expected of them by their families of generational wealth to keep the legacy going and make them proud. For them, it's very stressful because they are losing places to super smart Public school kids with perfect GPAs, test scores, and amazing ECs.\n\nI can't speak to the stress levels of International applicants. I know that they are all at a disadvantage because their localized education sometimes doesn't compare on a 1 to 1 basis to top US Private schools and even if you are in a top Int'l school, high school teachers, counselors, and parents still don't know what their American counterparts know. So if you have a super smart kid outside of the US, their intelligence alone often is not enough of a factor to get them admitted by T25 schools because of so many NON-academic factors which are not things they are used to thinking about locally.  But I would imagine that a kid in Brazil or India or China dreaming of attending Harvard or Yale or Stanford, would be very stressed out because they know that they are at a timeline disadvantage and don't have first-hand knowledge or access to resources that would help them craft a compelling application narrative. \n\nSo the kids applying to T25 Schools are stressed out of their minds. They are sleep deprived and scrambling to earn a spot. The kids applying to T50 Schools are a little bit less stressed. And those applying to T100 are still stressed but not freaking out. Everyone else is treating the college admissions process as a normal right of passage like Prom or Homecoming or Graduation and is not going mental about it because there are 4300 colleges in the US and there is some place for everyone. We have no lack of colleges and everyone who wants to go to college can eventually find a place even its an unranked private liberal arts college in the middle of the New Hampshire woods.","upvotes":9,"created_utc":1678512630.0},{"author":"iluvdilfs07","text":"i\u2019m also a sophomore and i don\u2019t really care. i don\u2019t have the best grades, i work and do mock trial just for fun (i definitely wouldn\u2019t do it if it was only for college transcripts) and i don\u2019t care about college that bad. i know i\u2019ll get into college and i don\u2019t really care if it\u2019s an ivy league school or a state school. all i want is to get into a college and do stuff that makes me happy. i\u2019m not going to stress out doing a bunch of stuff that won\u2019t make me happy so that i can get into a school with a 30% acceptance rate vs a 50% one. an education is an education.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678507423.0},{"author":"Vinny_On_Reddit","text":"I go to an above average hs (ranked T1500 by usnews and T500 on niche), around 5 people per year matriculate to ivy+ colleges.

I just feel like I need to type this much to explain my situation in-full.\n\nI'm a junior in highschool. Currently I have several hobbies and passions that I could major in\/make a career out of in the future. I'm attending a vocational high school focusing in multimedia, specifically editing and filmmaking, and I've got a couple years of experience in editing\/VFX work under my belt even well before highschool, along with software certifications. I've also got a massive passion for music. I'm learning two instruments, I'm making independent music along with doing as much music-related academic work as possible. I'm learning a lot about what goes into live music performance from just doing hands-on sound engineering work with the guidance of my music teacher. 99% of my success in high school has been within creative mediums. \n\nBut I also love videogames, and ever since being shown [code.org](https:\/\/code.org) in 5th grade I wanted to make videogames in the future. I had and still have a strong desire to express myself creatively by making indie games when I'm an adult. I have limited programming experience, but at every given opportunity to code in the past, I've fallen in love with doing it. I remember coding classes in 8th grade, where I would speedrun whatever in-class assignment we were doing just to spend the rest of the period making a passion project of some sort, and I was still very much at the top of the class. Indie videogame development is what I've seen myself doing in college for most of my life.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned, most of my highschool experience has been creative work, not logic-based stuff like math or coding. I'm worried that going to videogame development in college would be too big of a jump for me. But what I'm mainly worried about is I have a friend in computer science who knows loads about colleges and who I trust greatly on the subject, and he told me not to go into videogame development specifically. He recommends instead to get a computer science degree in something specializes FOR videogames, or software. The reason behind him saying this is because he said most people who go into the videogame industry do not maintain that career for a very long time. He said it would be better for me to get a degree in more general compsci so that I could have opportunities elsewhere if it turns out I don't want to continue with game development, and he's very adamant about this advice for me.\n\nI'm just not sure what to do from here. My justification for going into gamedev is that I know that I have loads of experience in other fields, so even if I specialized in game development and found out I didn't like it I could just go into film, video editing or music instead. It also seems like I just want to learn to code videogames for the sake of expressing myself creatively through another medium, so I thought maybe I could just learn code through a different avenue (like online courses) and major in something else that would help me in gamedev or in music\/whatever. But what worries me about THAT is if I'm not learning programming properly. I want to know how to make my games optimized on a professional level and not just be another yanderedev. \n\nUltimately my life goal is to create. I've had several longstanding videogame ideas that I've held in my brain for YEARS, and I just want to get them out. It's the same situation for me with every other artistic medium. I just want to make cool stuff, through whatever effective means I can.\n\nSo for the sake of TLDR, my main question is: Should I major in game development in college, or should I seek out a different major for one reason or another?\n\nIf anyone read this far, I just wanna say, thank you so much .w. I know it's a lot, and I tried shortening it but this is really the only way I could explain everything.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678567189.0,"comments":[{"author":"riveter1481","text":"You could major in cs and then take some game dev classes!

So he plans to kill all these rich people. \n\nHe used to be a simple cook who made cheeseburgers (a simple, commoner's food), which the main character uses to escape. She tells him she doesn't want any of his fancy food, but just a simple cheeseburger, causing the chef to feel smth he hasn't felt in years. She ends up being set free while the others die.\n\nYo I relate to this chef. I'm a junior in high school and I haven't felt truly happy since the 8th grade. Before covid started, before I came to high school, before I cared about the ivy league, before I cared about prestige, before I became depressed, before my life became toxic, before my childhood ended.\n\nI just want to go back to when times were simpler. You see, ever since coming to hs, I've fallen into this rabbit hole, almost like a college admissions cult. i became obsessed with prestige and comparing myself to others just so I can get into an elite school and look impressive to others. It took over my life, I was functioning on the outside but i felt dead on the inside. I no longer felt human anymore, all the joy inside of me was just sucked out by this toxic college admissions culture.\n\nI know this sounds menial, but trust me, i cant even explain in words how bad this has gotten as a result of toxic college admissions culture.\n\nLike the chef from the film, I really need to stop living a life for prestige because its fucking toxic and its making me depressed as hell. I need a cheeseburger to transport me back to a happier time in my life, because right now- I'm one of those rich people from the movie. Like them only going to the restaurant for the prestige and not bc they actually like food, im only doing all this shit in high school to get to the prestige I want in life. \n\n**Im not truly living life anymore, im living life solely to get into an ivy league - and isn't that just fucking sad.**\n\ni want to go back to 8th grade, 2019-2020, back when i didn't care about all this and when i just lived to live. I was actually happy and life actually had purpose. I think its good to care about school but I've most certainly crossed the limit to the point where school, grades, test scores, and extracurriculars have taken over my life. **This is my entire life.

The trouble is, my school offers a *lot* of APs (maybe around 30). \n\nHowever, they don\u2019t usually let us take any APs freshman year, and with my sophomore year fast-tracking my language courses left no room for anything but AP Italian (linguistics major+many classes as APs turns them from one semester to two), and additionally many core requirements can\u2019t be taken as APs. I have also been in band\/wind ensemble all four years, further limiting my schedule availability for AP courses. However, I have never received anything less than an A+ in an AP course, with the exception of APUSH where I got a 97% (A on transcript). I\u2019m reporting 5s on four tests (being all of the tests I\u2019ve taken so far): APUSH, Lang, Psych, Italian.\n\nIt feels like after a certain point a school offering more AP courses doesn\u2019t actually increase the ability for a student to take more APs. Still, I\u2019m anxious that 8\/30 APs will reflect poorly for me. To my knowledge, the only time I opted to take an honors course that could have been an AP was chemistry (because I was wrongly under the impression that I needed another art credit and took the one-semester honors chemistry option). I also left one empty block in the second semester of my senior year as all of my classes other than wind ensemble are APs and I wanted to give myself room for homework during my spring racing\/heavy training season for rowing. There was also one credit hour junior year that I left to fulfill an elective requirement that I\u2019m pretty sure couldn\u2019t be done with an AP, but to be honest there\u2019s a strong possibility that that\u2019s not the case.

Should I write essays about this? I know it sounds like I'm making excuses, but it's hard not to make excuses after realizing that I would have stood serious chances at top schools if I'd gotten diagnosed and treated sooner, and essentially my entire high school transcript is ruined by a 2-year-long waitlist to see a psychologist (I'm not trying to say that that's the only thing that \"ruined\" my HS transcript: I probably could have done better if I'd worked harder, paid attention more, etc.).","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678557098.0,"comments":[{"author":"danielisverycool","text":"Only talk about it if in your essays, you can explain how you\u2019ve dealt with your ADHD effectively and will now have an upward path in college.

[LONG POST]","author":"AvailableBowler5954","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/11ovcl7\/is_it_a_good_idea_to_take_a_gap_year_as_an\/","text":"I know I shouldn't be asking critical questions about my life decisions to Reddit lol, but I have been thinking about taking a gap year to apply to US Colleges again.\n\nNow why did I think about it? So my main target is actually Germany, which I want to go to in 2024. I was thinking, why waste time and money on spending 1 year in my home country? There would be so many expenses incurred by my parents at the time my country is going through a really severe economic crisis. It's not that it would put them in debt or anything lol; it's no problem for them but still no point wasting money on it.\n\nAnd at that time, I would be focusing on learning and improving my German, and University would be a distraction at that time.\n\nSo a gap year sounded like a good idea and then a thought came up to me, if I'm really gonna take a gap year, how about I apply again to US?\n\nAs I have gone through the admission process, I've learned a lot. There are a few things I can improve on by a mile which can help me in my application. \n\nOne is, SAT. My SAT score wasn't that great and I think if I try again, I can prepare better and subsequently get better score. Heck I think I can even get 1600 or close to it if I try lol. \n\nAnother area I can improve upon is my essay writing skills. Most of my essays were quite rushed, as I wrote them near to the deadline. So as I will have more time to write them, I believe I can write really great essays this time around.\n\nAnother possible thing I can do is take another A-Levels Subject and give it's exam in October-November just to show Colleges that I have 'taken academically the most challenging courses'. But I probably won't do that.\n\nBut these are the only things I can do now. The extracurriculars and every other thing, it's too late for me to do anything significant. I won't be in school, so school related or school organized extracurriculars are out of the equation for me. If I start doing more extracurriculars this time around, the Admission Officers will see right through that. What I mean is they will see that I'm only doing these activities for the sake of the Application.\n\nThe thing is, I'm just an average student. And I know I'm insane to even dare to dream of or apply to the best universities in the world. I know I can become better than I'm now. My grades are good, but my extracurriculars are just alright. \n\nI haven't done that many extracurriculars or haven't won any sort of award. I started doing extracurriculars mainly in my 3rd year of High School, because first two were plagued by COVID.\n\nI don't want to make this long. **The issue here is that I didn't start preparing and planning my application in my first year of high school.** I'm sure majority of you American start doing your activities from your first year of high school. And these College Admission Organizations which parents pay thousands of dollars for, start training kids from their first year of high school aswell. \n\nNow, I live in a country where extracurriculars aren't that important. Everything is about grades and marks. Admission to University here depends on your Entrance Exam marks and your high school marks. Now there are extracurriculars in my schools, but not as much as in other private schools or that much important. Even public high schools in USA have clubs and activities, but my school didn't have that many.\n\nI don't want to sound like a victim or anything, I take the blame for not preparing in my first year of high school. I knew I always wanted to go to USA, but I didn't have much knowledge at that time. I know I could've researched about everything since I spent so much time on the computer. I could have tried to find my passions and do activities on my own initiative. I accept that I'm at fault. But my circumstances and the types of opportunities available to me felt out of my control. But again, I realize I should have been the one to create these opportunities.\n\nI haven't won any International or National Olympiad, or any national or international award. Neither did I create a club, do research or even win any competition. And neither can I do any of these things in my gap year, as there's no time.\n\nHowever, I can work on my goals and passions. In other words, I can develop what is called a 'spike'. One such passion is Artificial Intelligence. I can learn and master it properly this year if I put in the effort. Though I can't really win any sort of competitions that early, but I can start building models and stuff. I can also work in conjunction with it on Robotics. I can participate in one competition over the summers, but I don't think I can win.\n\nI just don't want to give up on US Colleges this easily. I'm not going down this easily. I want to put in maximum effort. I want to at least be able to say that I tried my absolute best. And I know going to Harvard or Princeton or Caltech won't guarantee me success in life. But I still want to go. Yes I'll admit that I'm bit of a prestige whore. It's my dream. I can't go down without giving my 100%.\n\nI forgot to mention that I'm seeking FULL AID. I know I'm not entitled to Colleges spending over $200k on me. I need to be worthy enough for them to spend that much money on me. I know I'm not worthy enough right now, but I still want to try.\n\nSo, is it a good idea or not to take a gap year and apply again? This time, I'll be preparing better than last time. I plan on going for the 'shotgun method', which is apply to like 10-15 Colleges.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678569345.0,"comments":[{"author":"8newhope","text":"Honestly, as international seeking full aid, it still will be very difficult even you take a gap year.

But as the process is over, I can't be more happy with taking a gap.\n\nI managed to use some amazing opportunities, was selected for volunteering at my dream company (a year ago I would never believe that I volunteer here), enrolled at one cool spring program, where I take interesting courses and am writing a research on exciting topic. As you haven't written a research in HS, gap year would be a perfect opportunity to do that (but again, it's personal experience).\n\nIt's hard to describe how drastically my personality changed in a positive way. A year ago I saw going to university as the most significant part of my life, and now I understand it's just a part of my path :)\n\nOverall, my gap is 10\/10. Still, I understand that it's not for everyone. Your ideas about what to do are pretty cool, and you'll have plenty of time for preparing for SAT. If you decide to take a gap, your extracurriculars will also improve, but you need to have a good self-discipline.

It\u2019s normal to be sad and disappointed.

You are a success in that regard! You\u2019ve learned and mastered many skills (in particular, time management and executive functioning) that will serve you well in college. You have grown as an intellectual and you will also succeed in college.\n\nTry to think beyond UW. Think about where you want to be four years from now and how you can get there if UW doesn\u2019t work out for you. Will another UW campus allow you to achieve your goal? Community college? Another state school? Transferring to an out-of-state school with great financial aid (Reed College comes to mind \u2014 they don\u2019t offer merit scholarships, but I believe that they do provide full financial aid). I also bet some of the nearby colleges featured in \u201cColleges That Change Lives\u201d have March 15 or later admissions deadlines (for example, Willamette or U of Puget Sound). These colleges usually have great financial aid packages too \u2014 especially for someone with your credentials.\n\nI also recommend talking to your school\u2019s counselor to see if they have a relationship with the regional AO assigned to your school to perhaps get some feedback regarding whether a LOCI will help. Perhaps the AO can give the counselor some feedback regarding your application that would help your future application in the event that you want to transfer. Your counselor should also be able to advise you regarding different paths you can take to get your college degree. \n\nFinally, keep moving forward. If it\u2019s not UW, still go to college.

Most colleges in the US regardless of prestige give phenomenal educations.\n\nBut I\u2019ll answer your question anyway. Cornell (duh) , NYU, Columbia, Barnard are the most prestigious along with other LACs.\n\nThen there\u2019s lesser known gems I suppose. RIT, University of Rochester, Cooper Union, Macaulay Honors college (CUNY) are all highly regarded but not at the same level. Might as well shoot for these too, prestige whore.^Forgot RPI\n\nThen, at a small notch down there is the SUNY system as well as lesser known schools. Stony Brook, Binghamton, U of Buffalo, maybe Syracuse and Fordham are around these levels. Some would argue that Syracuse and Fordham should be at the notch above; sure, fair enough. For SUNYs though, you\u2019ll pay IN STATE tuition (10kish a year). This is enormously good value. If you are interested in pre health you can probably go to any one, Binghamton business is highly regarded, Buffalo engineering is nice, etc. Personally I like Stony\u2019s engineering and chem departments, I\u2019ll probably try to transfer into some form of engineering from chem after a year.\n\nThen there\u2019s the CUNYs, which literally only NYC students know. FYI this is the \u2018least prestigious\u2019. I\u2019m not sure how much they cost but after financial aid it is DIRT CHEAP. For instance my cousin goes to CUNY Baruch for accounting and pays like 4k a semester. On the other hand my cousin went to NYU,200k in debt and now has to go to grad school because he couldn\u2019t find a job. Baruch finance\/accounting\/business students get absurdly high salaries mid career because their connections rival those of literal Ivies\/T20s. If you are in NY and interested in that type of stuff, don\u2019t overlook Baruch. The other CUNYs are fine for instance Hunter for pre-health. You could try going to a CUNY then transferring to a more \u2018prestigious\u2019 school; it\u2019s not unheard of and you will save money in the tens of thousands in the long run.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678550190.0},{"author":"Relevant-Ad4902","text":"FIT?","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678513348.0},{"author":null,"text":"Cooper Union.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678513963.0},{"author":"spey_side","text":"Parsons sva fit pratt juiliard","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678544835.0},{"author":"Important-Row-5187","text":"Yeshiva","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678489609.0},{"author":"MMDCAENE","text":"Hobart and William Smith","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678551249.0},{"author":"Difficult_Software14","text":"Manhattan College for engineering especially Civil","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678553356.0},{"author":"Blutrumpeter","text":"Why impress people with your college when you can impress them by being a genuinely fun person :)","upvotes":0,"created_utc":1678541657.0}]},{"title":"uchicago LET ME INNNNN","author":"OutcomeOk3779","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/11ntlzw\/uchicago_let_me_innnnn\/","text":"**update: i got waitlisted**\n\n**DECISIONS ARE OUTTT!!** but post ur decisions in [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/zvxeq9\/university\\_of\\_chicago\\_regular\\_decision\\_megathread\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/zvxeq9\/university_of_chicago_regular_decision_megathread\/) instead of this post lol\n\nmanifest ur uchicago acceptance here ig\n\nedit: 1 hour to go and im shitting myself\n\nEDIT 2: UCHCIAGO DECISIONS ARE OUT and im too scared to open it","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678465523.0,"comments":[{"author":"plaid_bird","text":"RAHHHHH WE'LL GET IN","upvotes":56,"created_utc":1678465946.0},{"author":"rummanjan","text":"UC hicago if u let me in I'll call u Uchicago","upvotes":54,"created_utc":1678472625.0},{"author":"andimackwasabadshow","text":"I HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO\n\nI HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO\n\nI HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO\n\nI HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO","upvotes":38,"created_utc":1678482330.0},{"author":"Some-Chapter7296","text":"I have such an issue w rejection LOL.

I know the obligation can feel like a big time commitment, but the hard truth is that you just have to push through this final stretch to best set yourself up for college. (I don't think you need extra stress, but I just wanted to point out that you've already come so far.)\n\nObviously, things aren't that simple. I get procrastinating--and it seems okay, until anything gets slightly more academically difficult, at which point it can be hard to adjust back to being productive despite there being an urgent necessity to not procrastinate. Tbh, I'm kind of still figuring that out right now. But you don't want to wait for that whiplash, because it's pretty rough.\n\nSo how do you motivate yourself to do work instead of procrastinating? Sure, part of it has to deal with how urgent you perceive your academic obligations to be, but actually changing your habits away from procrastination (and really any other bad habits) ultimately comes down to what decisions you actually make.\n\nThis boils down to sleep and self-esteem. If you respect yourself, you will want to take care of yourself, and if you're well-rested, you'll feel much more energetic and capable of changing things for the better. Easier said than done, right? But I really encourage you to prioritize sleep, because getting enough sleep will pave the way for everything else. THAT BEING SAID, if you only care about sleep without any self-esteem, that could also fall into depressive habits, so you need to think of sleep as your \"recharging\"--during which your body literally recovers--rather than a temporary escape from stress (not assuming you'd do that; I just wanted to clarify just in case).\n\nSo even if you make way for sleep, how do you improve self-esteem? Well, a feeling of self-esteem comes from the personal perception that you can do things, and a great way to achieve that positivity is through doing things that make you genuinely happy, that satisfy you intrinsically and morally, that allow you to feel confident or hopeful. That could be hobbies, or spending time with family, or reframing how you see things in your life to make them seem more manageable, and pursuing the consequent desire for self-improvement, step by step.\n\nSorry if the ranting was excessive or unhelpful. It's not the most clear-cut stuff, but I hope you at least realize that you should be happy. I wish you happiness, at least.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678531441.0}]},{"title":"Caltech 8:31 AM or 8:31 PM (pst)??","author":"I_Love_Mango_2026","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/11oes4m\/caltech_831_am_or_831_pm_pst\/","text":".","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678523135.0,"comments":[{"author":"RichInPitt","text":"Or would a world-famous technology school use international standard UTC time?  \n\nAt a minimum, I would expect ISO8601-standard 24 time representation.

It\u2019s possible most students followed the \u201capply early\u201d guidance and the low number is still a reasonable percentage.\n\nBut I suspect there will still be a large number of RD applicants, so the rate will be down \\~10%, if not lower.\n\nIn terms of OOS, using Engineering as a proxy (they only report by College, not major), in-state acceptance is about 50% higher, though only 12% of applicants. So 22% is maybe 30% in-state, 20% OOS.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678578465.0},{"author":"kr-choi","text":"CS is getting much more popular each year.

Their engineering programs are nothing compared to NC State\u2019s. I haven\u2019t been able to get any scholarships or much aid from any of the schools I have applied to that I love. My mental health has severely gone downhill since my second semester started and I\u2019m on my way to my first B in my entire high school career in one class because of how badly I am doing.\n\nI have suffered through so much to be here and I am just devastated at the results of all my hard work. I don\u2019t see a future for myself anymore, and I hate myself for not doing better. Looking for any advice or just words of wisdom.\n\nEdit: Typo","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678513710.0,"comments":[{"author":"chumer_ranion","text":"Without totally glossing over your disappointment, as some might be tempted to do, I don\u2019t quite understand your situation. Your dad wants you to apply to WCU and ECU\u2014does he know that your cost of attendance at either of those schools would be roughly the same as NCSU, which you seem much keener about?\n\nI think we, and more importantly you, need more information about your family\u2019s financial situation. Maybe your parents are cagey about finances\u2014that\u2019s fine, mine are too. But the fact remains that you could apply to WCU and ECU and still be in the same situation. \n\nAnd for the record, I understand your disappointment without reservation. I know we try to have an egalitarian view of universities here, but WCU and ECU aren\u2019t even top 200 universities. It\u2019s no secret that opportunities would be better at NCSU.\n\nEdit: I think your folks should just pay whatever they can afford and then help you take out loans for NCSU. The 4-year COA at NCSU as a total debt, even full pay, is almost manageable as a mechanical engineer.

Why would going to either school mean you don\u2019t have a future for yourself? \n\nThere\u2019s a lot that can be said here about how a hypercompetitive college admissions culture puts unreasonable pressure on applicants, but I think the main thing I\u2019d emphasize is that the work you\u2019ve done is about you and your learning, not about some name on a piece of paper you\u2019ll get in 4-5 years, then probably put in your closet and never look at again. \n\nI\u2019m not as familiar with WCU, but to focus on ECU for a minute, it\u2019s a great mid-sized school with a good balance of teaching and research. Just because other people might go there for the party scene - nothing wrong with that - if you don\u2019t want to participate, no one will force you to. I can guarantee there will be other incredibly talented, hard working, and academically minded students going there because it\u2019s a great low cost, public, and more undergraduate oriented school. I\u2019m certain the same is true of WCU and those are all desirable things. Graduating debt free or with money in the bank is something that will really change your first years post college for the better.\n\nBe proud of getting into some competitive schools. You worked hard and got in - you don\u2019t have anything to prove to anyone. In an ideal world what college you go to wouldn\u2019t be dependent on what you can afford, but you\u2019ll have great opportunities no matter where you go.

I go to a pretty high-up high school in my country and have averaged around a 3.0 GPA without diagnosis since my freshman year.

All of elementary\/middle school I was a \"gifted kid\" and now I'm looking at a likely failing grade in history and a number of other mediocre to poor grades in some\/most other classes. And while I'm figuring everything out (more or less completely on my own right now, with the benefit of meds) I strongly doubt that I'll be able to magically turn my GPA into the magic number that will get me into the colleges of my dreams. I feel like that's probably already been robbed from me. So that said, what do I do? I know I'm not destined for Harvard (and to be blunt I wouldn't want to go to a school like that anyways) but a lot of the school's I'm actively interested\/excited over have acceptance rates around the 20s and I don't know if I can manage that.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678502092.0,"comments":[{"author":"prsehgal","text":"Start by picking up the book **The K & W Guide to Colleges for the Learning Disabled: A Resource Book for Students, Parents, and Professionals** - it's an amazing resource.","upvotes":13,"created_utc":1678507580.0},{"author":"AprilFlower13","text":"I\u2019m not too sure but usually in college apps there\u2019s a place to add any special circumstances, you can explain your situation there and I\u2019m sure they will review your app taking everything you write into account.

It was a rainy windy night. We got there early and had a few minutes to chat w the area AO who was assigned to her high school, and he was scheduled to be on her campus the next day. We talked about how I went to Tulane in the 80s although didn\u2019t graduate from there (does that count as legacy?), how my older son was waitlisted and the AO said aw, they only took 2 off the waitlist that year\u2026 more chit chat about how much my daughter loved their fun admissions mailers, virtual events etc during the pandemic and it was the only school that had sent her sophomore specific things, not spamming her w \u201capply now!\u201d info that wasn\u2019t relevant to her. \n\nLikely because of the weather only 3 other students showed for the presentation, and my daughter was the only junior. The presentation was really good, she was excited. The AO said he was impressed she\u2019d come so far and he looked fwd to being at her HS the next day. Weather prevented the AO from getting to her high school, and they had a brief email exchange saying sorry the meeting didn\u2019t happen, hopefully next year. This year as a senior she attended another area info session, it was packed and lead by a different AO, but she confirmed the previous one was still assigned to review apps from her school.\n\nHer stats were all great as everyone else\u2019s are\u2026 but how to stand out? When she wrote her why Tulane essay, she talked about drinking coffee from my massive Tulane mug from the 80s (hence maybe getting the legacy boost even though not a true legacy listed on common app); But most important \u2014 she mentioned the AO by name and quoted something he had said at the Monterey session that resonated w her. So on reading this, it\u2019s pretty certain the AO remembered her and he was probably impressed w her interest and personal engagement, standing apart from other applicants. She was accepted EA and given a nice merit package.\n\nSo the takeaway is to go to every info session possible, go early and maybe offer to help set up or somehow try to make yourself memorable if possible. Take notes w the presenter\/AO\u2019s name and find something in the presentation that you can reference later that was meaningful to you.\n\nFollow up w your area AO w a thank you, maybe ask a brief question. Give yourself a basis for possible future engagement maybe months later w an update, when you\u2019re going to visit campus or impressions from a tour, or something in the news about their school that caught your eye. Don\u2019t overdo it but enough so they might remember you positively when they are reviewing your app. Not all schools track demonstrated interest, but if they are choosing btwn you and another applicant, if they remember you and\/or feel you are more sincere in your interest, they wd be more likely to choose you.","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1678480011.0},{"author":"reformed-ofcourse","text":"Aaahh.

As a native Washingtonian, the University of Washington has always been my first choice growing up. However, in the spring of 2019, I was rejected by UW, my dream school, and accepted into Stanford, as well as UIUC and UC Berkeley. Whether you believe it or not, if I had been offered a spot at UW at the time, I would have immediately committed to the university over Stanford, UIUC, or UCB. The rejection was truly shocking and still hurts even to this day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stumbled across a post today in udub's subreddit, stating that \"Why UW rejected you despite your good stats. Your writing sucked. Someone had to say it.\" which received over 200 upvotes and many agreeing comments. After reading the post, I realized that I might have dodged a bullet.\n\nI do acknowledge that the essay plays a major role, if not the most important part, in the university application process. However, it is just one piece of the application puzzle, especially since the University of Washington uses a \"holistic review\" approach to admissions. This means that the admissions committee considers multiple aspects of the applicant's profile, including academic performance, extracurricular activities, personal qualities and character, and other unique factors. While the essay is certainly an important part of the application, it's not the only factor that the admissions committee considers. So even if you did everything \"right\", you may still not be the right fit for the university for various reasons. It does NOTmean that your essay \"sucked\".\n\nI remember being excited about the prospect of attending UW and putting my all into my application. So, to read such a dismissive and condescending statement from a current student was disheartening. It's discouraging to think that there are people who attend such prestigious universities and still hold such closed-minded and arrogant views.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut after thinking about it more, I realized that the university culture and environment can greatly impact a student's overall college experience. And if the student body at UW is filled with individuals who hold such pretentious attitudes, then I am grateful to have avoided that kind of toxic environment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I believe that the university you attend doesn't define your worth or success in life. And I am proud of the path I have taken and the experiences I have had since being rejected from UW.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to that UW student who made the dismissive post, I hope they learn to be more humble and open-minded in their future endeavors. And to anyone else who has faced rejection from a university, they were excited about, I hope this serves as a reminder that sometimes, things happen for a reason and you might have dodged a bullet from a situation that wouldn't have been the best fit for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake care and stay positive!  \n\n\nEDIT:  \nHi there,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to apologize for any offense my post may have caused. I understand that my comments about the University of Washington and its student body may have been unfair and unfounded. I recognize that a group of Reddit users' immature behavior does not represent an entire school or its student body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy intention was not to generalize or make assumptions about the University of Washington or its community. I simply wanted to share my personal experience and offer some encouragement to those who may have faced rejection from a university they were excited about. So I once again apologized for my poor wording.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also want to clarify that the reason why I wrote that post in the first place was because my cousin was rejected from UW, and I understand how hard he worked over the past four years and how much time he spent preparing his UW essay. He actually sent me the Reddit post that I referenced in my original post. He was devastated and in tears after reading it, and it was his emotional response that prompted me to write about my own experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoving forward, I will be more mindful of how my words may be perceived by others. I hope that we can all approach conversations about university admissions with an open mind and without making assumptions about entire groups of people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading this apology.","upvote_ratio":0.38,"created_utc":1678563521.0,"comments":[{"author":"HappyCava","text":"I find it rather surprisingly and off-putting that you would assume that a post in a subreddit is indicative of the sentiment and maturity of over 40,000 college students.

We go to different high schools (just a town apart) and have been friends for over ten years. When applying to colleges, I cast a very wide net and definitely applied to a lot of schools I felt unqualified for. I ended up getting accepted to all the schools I heard back from (except for an ivy ED but I'm at peace with it) and will be attending Tufts in the fall! I applied to roughly 20 schools, all of which I researched heavily and while some were very different from the others, they all had a number of things I liked about them. My best friend goes to a larger high school. She took less APs than I did but her school offers less and she has MANY dual enrollment credits. She decided to only apply to schools in and around our nearby big city (the curse of growing up in a small town). She applied to 4 or 5 schools total. Long story short, she was just waitlisted from a school she was sure she'd get into (now she won't hear back until the SUMMER) and she's asking me for help. I don't know how to support her, I've never encountered similar issues. I kept telling her to apply to more schools, especially schools that gave better aid because that was a big factor for her. Now, her next best option is a school she doesn't like very much that would put her in a lot of debt. What are her next steps? Will a letter of interest help if the school's reasoning is \"not enough space\" (which by the way is sort of cruel considering that she applied in the fall) (like they definitely HAD room when she applied). How effective is negotiating with larger colleges? Especially Pace and Fordham. Has anyone had actual success trying to get more money? Tufts is a non-negotiating school so I never had the opportunity to try. Also, one of her options is Hofstra but she doesn't know much about it, only applied because of location.

In the misery that was quite literally the worst year of my life, I threw myself into the future and formed plans that I prayed would come to fruition: an acceptance and attendance to MIT.\n\nI knew almost nothing about MIT \u2014 I\u2019ll admit that I still know very little. But I knew that the student body was accepting of queerness, there was a DIII track program, and science and math were the primary focus. And that was enough, amidst the backlash surrounding my first and presently only coming \nout of the closet and newfound passions in running and STEM. That odd mixture of both depression and hope. \n\nI never shared this dream with anyone \u2014 it was for myself and myself alone.\n\nBut MIT was just a beacon of light.

My fate does not orbit around or hinge on this one decision.\n\nYet I will recognize that it helped me. Not the school, but the dream itself, which guided me through a difficult time and encouraged me to reach far beyond what was just within my grasp.\n\nI doubt MIT would be the school for me anyway. I need a balance between work and play in college \u2014 although I do highly value academics \u2014 that probably isn\u2019t there like I need it to be. I don\u2019t want to run in college anymore. I\u2019ll probably find the same, if not more, support for being queer at the other colleges I applied to. I know I\u2019ll likely be mourning within the next week, but I don\u2019t think I should. \n\nI am content to let this former dream die in the very silence it was born in. It was only for me, and it did what it was supposed to: pushing me to reach new heights and learn about myself and overcome the many hurdles that life set in my way throughout high school. It\u2019s time to separate the school from the dream, and when I open that decision letter, I know that it won\u2019t matter like I used to want it to.

I still remember coming to move-in day, alone, in an '88 Oldsmobile and not being able to find a spot that didn't have a BMW\/Audi\/Mercedes adjacent to it. I didn't know where to park because I was afraid of scuffing the \"rich\" cars. That was my first sign. \n\nThe second sign was the bookstore. The official school apparel was vineyard Vines -- I had no idea what it was but I knew based on the price tag I wasn't getting that sweatshirt. I grabbed something off of the clearance rack and moved on. \n\nThe third sign was just the lack of shared experiences. I had never left my state before, while folks would talk about service trips to Africa, or a long ski weekend in Colorado. It was hard for me to connect with life outside of school and academics. \n\nHere's the important part -- where I *DID NOT* notice it was in the people. One of the most generous, beautiful souls I've ever met had a parent who was a hedge fund manager. I was so worried about the limitations of my own experiences that I wasn't prepared for how it was going to open my eyes to diversity of thought and experiences. I met students from all around the world, from all different backgrounds. If I can be completely transparent with you, it actually broke some of MY negative stereotypes about wealthy families; I had some learning to do, too. \n\nI did struggle to fit in until I found my lane, and a lot of my appreciation for my college experience was in retrospect -- but I also didn't have this perspective and spent a few years with imposter syndrome spinning my wheels. I survived, and it helped me professionally. Ironically enough I ended up going to an even wealthier institution for my graduate degree. \n\nYou can do this.

My upper middle class roommate was stratospherically above anything I ever imagined, and she wasn\u2019t one of the rich kids. Whereas I can still remember exactly how many shirts, sweaters, pairs of pants, and towels I owned.  \n\nNobody judged me, as far as I know. I didn\u2019t dress well but I fit in just fine. I didn\u2019t get the fancy vacations or the study abroad. Buying the \u201coptional\u201d books and study guides was out of the question - I didn\u2019t have that kind of budget - so the academic struggle was more than it should have been. That\u2019s the main impact, tbh. I did tend to gravitate towards friends with a similar background, perhaps out of the comfort of shared experience. You find your tribe. But people are not better or worse, nicer or meaner, more judgy or more accepting at different levels of the economic food chain. \n\nCollege is not high school. Conformity is no longer a prized value. Wealthy and poor have most of the same resources and experiences on campus. You\u2019re supposed to value and respect and mix with people of all different backgrounds, and you do. It works. Just be open; if you detect a chip on your own shoulder, try to brush it off. Don\u2019t be ashamed of who you are and where you came from, because nobody will think the less of you for that.","upvotes":49,"created_utc":1678383132.0},{"author":"BeGayCommitArsons","text":"don't worry there'll be plenty FGLI and students from rural areas, so you won't be alone. if someone tries to give you crap for where you are from, then they're not worth your time.

That first semester will be adjustment, as you sit in a classroom with a bunch of elite boarding school kids (who all seem to know each other!) and they seamlessly transition to college work while you get adjusted to college life from the underperforming, low income schools. Be prepared that you might have lower grades than you are used to for the first time. But keep trying. Seek help early and often.  Use the resources available to you like the writing center before your first assignment is due - it will help massively. Just remember admissions picked you because they saw that you had something to add to campus. \n\n2) The culture shock is real. People will have more money than you thought possible and it\u2019s hard not to let the inequity wear on you. You will see people wearing coats that cost more than months of your families rent and then see the emails to everyone on campus when they lose it at a party while\ndrunk. I had a friend at Brown who called in astonishment that her roommate had $10,000 a month allowance from her parents. And this was the early 90\u2019s!  Thankfully, my LAC wasn\u2019t nearly as flashy (lots of wealthy kids from nice suburban towns though) but law school was the first time I saw the 1% of the 1% up close (like \u201cI have a entire town named after our family\u201d real estate developer kids and Middle Eastern royalty) and it was quite the culture shock. \n\n3) connect with other students in your shoes. There are often clubs for kids that are your demographic - first-gen, Hispanic, Black, international, gay, etc.  The older students are awesome for support as they have been through this all. \n\n4) Go to office hours and get to know your professors. This is the best part about being at an Elite LAC. They will help you navigate this transition. They will help you with internships and opportunities. I would not have achieved as much without their support. \n\nLastly, keep an open mind. I found it best to think of navigating an entirely new space like a sociological experiment or getting into character for theater. Watch them and learn. There is a possibility that there will $ssholes but you will learn to recognize them. If you can fool them, even better. The professor has great advice for picking up one of their weird interests (watches, wine as you hit 21, sailboats, crew, skiing, golf, etc).  All of it will help you navigate the professional world as you get older. \n\nGood luck to you and I hope find your tribe of \u201cweird gay kids\u201d soon!","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1678384699.0},{"author":"lotsofgrading","text":"Hi! I'm a college professor.\n\nThis is just my personal opinion based on observation, but I don't think other students will care what \\*high school\\* you went to. Students at universities don't talk about specific high schools, unless they all come from the same set of towns, which doesn't seem like it will be the case at the university you will attend. The name of your high school probably won't come up, and if it does, it won't register with anyone. Students notice, as a social detail, whether other students went to public or private school. That's it.\n\nYou're going to have a great time, I promise. My advice is to pick up one (1) hobby that rich people would register as belonging to their world, like knowing about antique watches or knowing about good cheeses.

Nearly every college nowadays is made up of a giant mixture of every kind of person under the sun. The days when you could claim a school had a 'certain' kind of student are largely gone. My alma mater, a top liberal arts college, has always been described as  \"preppie\" (and it still kind of is), but is also has a notable number of foreign students, many ethnic minorities, a lot of gay students, and so on. It even has women (!) -- which it did not have when I was there decades ago. Now there's a new idea. \n\nDon't hide anything about yourself, but on the other hand, don't broadcast it which will quickly get tiring. And, most important of all, have a sense of humor. I knew a lot of kids from small towns and rural areas in college who kind of tried to make it seem like those places were some kind of big deal. They weren't, so it just sounded silly. On the other hand, some of my friends who came from Podunkville or rural Nowhere had a great sense of humor and joked about it. Those people I liked. \"I'm from a small town you never heard of, and no, there's not a whole lot to do there except cow-tipping. Would you like to go cow-tipping sometime?,\" is a perfectly good answer to \"Where are you from?\" And it has a little humor, too. \n\nIt's confidence that wins the day. Lots of amazing people came from \"low income schools\" in nowhere places and dress any way they damn well please, and some of them are Black or gay or poor and don't hide it in any way. But they also don't look down on other people or try to force them to think or behave in any way. Don't be a missionary about your own lifestyle since that gets tiresome fast. Leave people's personal lives alone and they will do that for you. It's always better to be confident enough to not talk about yourself all the time. \n\nIf you're the gay kid from the \"ghetto school,\" good for you. That's amazing, and you you must have been a good student, too. It's amazing because coming from Happytown High School where there are no problems and everyone works hard does not make anyone special or particuarly impressed. Coping with difficulties well does. \n\nDon't hide where you came from or who you are in any way. If you lack confidence, just fake it for awhile and people will come to see you as confident. Ask people about themselves and don't talk about yourselves too much, and people will come to see you as empathetic and trust you. Help people when they need it, and they will see you as a good person. Don't talk about yourself, and don't talk too much in general, and people will see you as having quiet confidence. \n\nYou'll be fine.

You WILL find your people, even if it takes a little time at the start. Rich assholes definitely do exist, but I\u2019ve also met some of the sweetest people I know in these environments, it\u2019s all about personality. That being said, try to go in with an open mind. The difference between deliberate elitism and just straight up, non-malicious ignorance can seem very small at times - some kids just genuinely know very little about how people live outside of their bubble, and seemingly rude questions might just be genuine curiosityfrom actually kind people.

You got in just like everyone else and you do deserve to be there, and the best part is that these kinds of schools have so many resources that you can take advantage of - from events to jobs to extra-curriculars - that would usually be hard to get access to\n\n5. Network! Slightly more ethically grey area for sure, but my mindset is that if you are in an environment with so many connected people, you might as well use it. However, this doesn\u2019t automatically mean sucking up to kids you might despise as people might generally think, for me it has always come with people I\u2019m already friends with.

This is definitely WAY cheaper than OOS\/private tuition. \n\nComing from an Asian country, we usually pay around 10k per year in tuition fees at public universities. There are private universities and the option of going overseas which would obviously cost way more and so most people try to make do with what they can afford. For some it\u2019s going to a public university and for others it might be taking a different route first before university so that they can afford it. \n\nObviously the US is very different from Asian countries and so I\u2019m not trying to compare the both. The density of Asian cities definitely makes it easier to save money by staying at home and commuting while studying.

I was in a terrible mental place, and did not want to go to college. I applied anyways and got accepted into a good college from the state I had moved from. I moved back to the U.S in March 2022, planning to attend in September 2022. However, due to several reasons, as well as the fact I had applied and got accepted in a different country, I was due to pay international student tuition. Which was 50k annually. No way my parents nor I would be able to afford that.\n\nThis is where I kind of put myself in a bind. \n\nI never wanted to go to college. I was in a terrible mental state. I only applied on the behest of my parents. So I saw this as an opportunity. Long story short I withdrew from that college as a student but lied to my parents and said that I could go back in September of 2023. Basically some half truth half b.s. excuse I pulled from my ass about deferring enrollment. \n\nIt has now been a year since then. I've been working and paying rent and bills on my own. I have a full time job. But working has made me realize that I certainly do not want to do this for the rest of my life. I need a degree. I've grown a lot and my experience in the work force has matured me and equipped me with valuable lessons. I don't regret my decisions, except that I lied to my parents and will probably disappoint them. They were so ecstatic when I got accepted. \n\nObviously I have missed the deadlines to be able to attend this upcoming September. I have the option of attending community college while working, getting my associates, and then earning my bachelor degree at a well known institution. With community college, I can start right away. But my parents are vehemently against it. \n\nSo I was considering applying to several colleges for the Spring semester. I have a couple in mind I would like to pursue, but I would have to reapply for the college I withdrew from.\n\nWhat is my best course of action?

Many of the top schools like MIT or Caltech look for both passion and skills for your selected major. As I am likely to major in mathematics, I was wondering how I would demonstrate this.  Most people I know who are going into math or other STEM majors have math competitions results such as AIME, getting to state in MNML, etc. The one problem with that is I am garbage at math competitions because I am *slow.* \n\nMaybe I just have too high an opinion of myself, but I don't think I'm bad at math, I'm just too slow for math competitions. I'm the kid who uses his free time to derive or prove every formula we learn in class, and even apply the knowledge to discover new stuff. For example, I remember when I was in pre-calc I derived some formulas to extend all the trig I was learning into n-dimensions. \n\nBut I was wondering how I would demonstrate this passion and at least non-zero amount of skill at math to colleges? From what I've heard publishing pure math research as a high-school student is far harder than in other STEM fields and I don't have competition scores to fall back on. I've already taken all the math class my school offers and am beginning to take as many as possible at my state college, but to my understanding colleges want to see investment beyond just classes. Is there some more quantifiable method than just writing in my essays \"dude I'm good at math trust.\\*\"\n\n*\\*Worded more eloquently.

You said you aren't good at math competitions, but it isn't that you need to win every competition, it is that you competed.  You have to show significant STEM engagement OUTSIDE of HS. For example, if you have received an A in every advanced math class that your HS offers and a 5 on AP math everything, it is still insufficient because all of your STEM engagement is in HS.  \n\nPre-college summer programs would be one way, but IMO, still insufficient for Caltech.

I have managed to keep a high gpa so far heading into Q2 finals. But the pandemic did a real number on how students study and what they really learned in HS. Plus there was cheating, grade inflation, and way less accountability. Deadlines didn\u2019t really mean deadlines. Across the board in my science, math, and core courses like history test averages are lower than in prior years and my profs keep sending emails out saying they don\u2019t extend deadlines and don\u2019t accept late work. I\u2019m sure most students here who are struggling will figure it out. But while the transition to college is usually hard it seems super hard for my class (2026) and I assume for 2027. So universities are trying to get in front of this. Take the warnings seriously and take the time to learn how to study.

They told me that it came down to my essays and fit with the college. People talk about \"fit\" a lot, but this confused me because I've been taking CS courses at UIUC since my sophomore year and I've been involved in the program in various other ways like working with undergrads as a course assistant. \n\nI asked which essay it was, and they told me that it was my essay about career goals and how UIUC will help achieve them. I wrote my essay about how I want to use computer science creatively in conjunction with other parts of my life and pursue personal projects to hopefully make something big (i.e. by making a food allergy app that has safety ratings for restaurants and labeled menus because I have a food allergy). I talked about my experience with CS 225 on a creative project to say that UIUC approaches CS with the same view that I do: trying to have fun, exploring the endless possibilities that computers and technology unlock, and ultimately using CS to solve real-world problems that affect everyday life. \n\nThe admissions representative (who was super nice btw) said that although they could see how my essay could connect with societal impact, a lot of people say they want to make apps that help people and that my career goals weren't solid enough. I do want to have a societal impact, I want to make something cool and something big, but I guess I should have emphasized that more. \n\n**A little bit about me:**\n\nI'm a high school senior interested in majoring in computer science. I applied to UIUC, was deferred, and then was rejected from CS but accepted into Engineering Undeclared (my second choice). \n\nI've taken five UIUC courses, four of which are in the CS curriculum, and received As\/A+s in all of them. \n\n* UIUC CS 125: Introduction to Computer Science I (now known as 124), I also served as a course assistant for this class the semester after I completed it. I recorded around 20 walkthrough videos that they still use on their course website and spent around 30 hours on the online help site helping UIUC students one-on-one. I was offered a paid position as a course associate the next semester, but I had to decline since they only hire undergrads. \n* UIUC CS 128: Introduction to Computer Science II\n* UIUC Math 213: Discrete Structures (equivalent to CS 173)\n* UIUC CS 225: Data Structures. For this class, I worked on a semester final project on graphs and graph algorithms with college students. I wrote most of the code for the project and also came up with the concept. The professor gave us full points and left comments saying that it was \"probably the best overall code execution I graded this semester.\"\n\nI've heard people say that colleges don't want to see high schoolers becoming college students and that they want students to use their time for other extracurriculars, but I took these classes because I love CS and because my high school gives us the opportunity to do it for free so it's just a good resource. \n\nI also didn't just spend my time grinding college courses. I was in the ILMEA all-state honors orchestra for two years as a wind player (first chair in my district), I lead my school's coding club, and I co-founded a scholastic bowl Discord bot that generates flashcards for review and helps people practice. I'm also the vice president at my school, I played varsity soccer, I co-lead a club that plans fundraisers and works with some nonprofit organizations, and I did research programs with UIUC professors. \n\nThe admissions rep said that in the end, I was qualified in terms of GPA, coursework, activities, and test scores, but that it came down to that one essay and fit. I've been interested in computer science since my freshman year of high school, and I know that the UIUC CS acceptance rate is single digit now, but it's honestly pretty discouraging. I really love UIUC CS and I thought I fit in, but I guess not. Siebel has kind of felt like a second home for a while now, and it sucks that they don't want me because I didn't have clear enough career goals. \n\nIt seems like 150 words mattered more than the rest of my other experiences in the end, so my warning to future applicants to UIUC CS is to be direct when answering the essay prompts because it could end up mattering more than you think. For those of you that want to major in CS, you should all definitely apply to UIUC CS, it's an amazing program with amazing classes and opportunities and you will love it if you get in.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678325074.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"[deleted]","upvotes":63,"created_utc":1678337386.0},{"author":"Intelligent-Low-3038","text":"Hey man it's not your fault at all.

Between them they're looking at 80 apps for the last 20 predicted-yield weighted seats in the incoming class, each of which has been rated on a scale from 1-5 on 8 dimensions, and has scored between 38 and 38.5. They shuffle all 80 folders. They take the one on top, put it in an \"accept\" pile, and write down the yield prediction number (if you are rated as 70 percent likely to commit, you count as .7 seats in the incoming class). They take the next folder off the top. Add the new yp number. They keep going until the YP sum hits 20.0. They have 32 folders in the accept pile, and 48 left in what is now the reject pile. Everybody at the table grabs a handful of folders from that pile. They open up a folder, look for the weakest subjective dimension (ECs, LOR, Essay) and subtract half a point. Now every folder in the reject pile has either a lower score than every folder in the accept pile, or is precisely tied on the cut-line of 38.00.  \n\n\nIn this imaginary paranoid delusion of mine, they could have just as easily told you that your LORs weren't enthusiastic enough, or that your ECs weren't broad enough. It wouldn't matter - you were good enough to get in, likely marginally better in some sense than some people who did get in, but you didn't survive the random tie-breaker and they are engaging in a post-hoc justification of a decision that was explicitly random. In this fantasy, they originally thought your essay was quite good, but then were forced to come up with a reason that it wasn't good enough. And people can always come up with a reason.  \n\n\nSo, any normal rational person would absolutely take the AO's explanation at face value: Your essay was weak given what they were looking for. Abnormal irrational me is still going to sit here and low-key believe that your essay was fine, and Admissions folks just don't want to admit that the last stage of the selection process is drawing from a hat.","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1678378977.0},{"author":"konnorTraves","text":"Their admissions office is really fucked man.

I plan on volunteering with NDMS and eventually going to med school.\n\nHowever another option that I would absolutely love is UVA medical center\u2019s EMT training program. It\u2019s a Level 1 trauma center, and you get paid to get your EMT cert. it\u2019s more hospital based, which I both like and dislike.\n\nIf I chose to go to my parents Alma mater, paying would be a big issue, and it would be a really big adjustment. CC would have a few problems. we couldn\u2019t move out of the county if I wanted to keep the scholarship, it would be less of an adjustment.

Please Help","author":"Nextaus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/11n81i2\/i_have_a_275_gpa_is_my_future_screwed_please_help\/","text":"So as the title implies, yes I have a 2.75 unweighted GPA. I am currently a junior in hs (writing this on 3\/9\/23) and I'm coming up on the end of the first quarter of my second semester. People always told me growing up that grades were important but I just kind of shrugged them off cause yk, who wants to do homework. But when I started my freshman year, my teachers told us that this was an important year, grades-wise, to set ourselves up for a good GPA and a good future. At the time, I again, shrugged this off because I'd heard this all of my life and nothing had really happened to me because of it. And before I go on, I want to explain that I'm not just some hopeless kid who struggles to get D's, in elementary, I was in the honor society, and in middle school, I did fairly well. As for standardized tests, I've always excelled in them. I've never gotten below a B in any state test (I live in Florida so the FSA and EOC). But the problem is that I never tried. I never tried to get good grades and I never tried to raise them and I never cared for them because my only concern was passing to the next grade at the time. So I guess I never saw the value and the benefits of having good grades and maintaining them. But at the end of my sophomore year, I was just like, huh, I wonder what would happen if I devoted some time to do at least half of the homework that I was given, and my grades skyrocketed. Right then and there I realized the importance of getting good grades and most importantly, turning in homework. So ever since then, I've been actually trying in my classes. Right now I'm taking 2 AP classes (AP English Language and AP US History) and I plan to take 6 next year since the ones I have now aren't really challenging. This is my first year taking any AP class but now I'm absolutely devoted to getting my grades up and showing at least a smidgen of self-improvement and an upwards trend in my grades. Before I was maybe a (C) to (B-) student but now I'm easily a B+ student, and I still think I could get better grades but yk, but I also have a life. I took the PSAT twice already and in freshman year I got a 1040 (1120 SAT conversion) and in sophomore year I got an 1140 (1220 SAT conversion). I took the SAT on March 1st so I'm really praying that I got a 1300 but if I don't, I can take it again, and then for sure I will. (When I get my score ill update this thread :) ) But I know that even if I get a 1500, I won't be able to become what I want to be. It sounds silly now but I've always wanted to become a surgeon since I could remember. I'm taking an EMT course at my school that started my freshman year and I get my EMR or EMT certification next year. Funny enough I've always made sure to do extra well in that class since that was my passion but I'm worried now that it was all in vain. I've done calculations and for me to get a 3.0 GPA, I would have to get about a 3.7 GPA my senior year and if you've read anything above, you would know that that would be next to impossible. But at least if I had a 3.0, colleges would at least look at my submission and I think then I would have a chance because I've always done well on standardized tests. And I do not want to go to just some ratty-tatty alleyway college, I just want to go to a respectable school, somewhere I won't be embarrassed to tell family and friends and somewhere I can build myself up and, as cliche as it is, follow my dreams. So my question is really, what can I do? What colleges should I realistically apply to or aim for? Can I still follow my dreams of becoming a doctor and if not what other career choices could I realistically aim for?

Here\u2019s my advice\n\n1. Call the student financial center and explain your situation. Continuously keep doing this and try to see if they\u2019ll send a counselor to determine why your aid is the way it is. Draft an email requesting to withdraw your acceptance. If you\u2019re ED, ask early decision to extend the deadline for financial reasons. NEU gave me 3 extensions back to back until my issue was resolved. My enrollment deposit was originally Jan 15 but the 3 extensions added a month.\n\n2. Persist. The battle is not lost yet. I remember I was absolutely hopeless as my only other alternative for the moment was UMD for 60k\/yr (also not affordable). Do not give up hope because it is possible. \n\n3. Find a backup plan. Worst case scenario this does not work and if that happens you need a backup plan which you\u2019re happy with. This was the one thing I didn\u2019t have but I got lucky with my aid so it worked out in the end.\n\nBest of luck to your gf, I\u2019m confident things will work out for her no matter what happens.","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1678309079.0},{"author":"Knavvery","text":"With an EFC of 0, the cheapest options for your girlfriend are private schools that promise to meet 100% demonstrated financial aid.

A lot of low-income students assume from the start that top private schools like the Ivy League will be too expensive for them and won't apply, yet these schools with their absurd endowments are EXACTLY the schools that are cheapest for low-income students, to the point where they'll probably be even less expensive than the students' local state schools.\n\nNow that it's so late into the application season, I would see if there's any schools that meet 100% demonstrated financial aid that she can still apply to (or *fingers crossed* has already applied to). Alternatively, her local state school or community college is probably going to be the next cheapest option for her.\n\nIf she's deadset on attending this private school, she and her family will have to seriously consider taking out an absurd amount of loans to cover the costs.

Joe Biden, the acting President of the United States of America -- where most of the victims originated from -- has made it his top priority to find the high school seniors, and pledged to do \"whatever it takes\" to \"bring our boys and girls home\". Other governments chimed in as well. For example, a top Japanese diplomat remarked that \"we've already lost enough of our citizens to North korean kidnappings, so having dozens of our most talented high school students being kidnapped is undoubtedly a massive blow to the nation\". Indeed, while the victims themselves were all diverse as could be from each other, with different race, sex, gender orientation, political perspectives, socioeconomic status, and countries of origin, two things tied them together: their status as some of the top students in their respective schools, and their fixation on university \"prestige\", generally defined to be within the top 50 of the US News and World Report annual college rankings.\n\nYet, the recent discovery of said victims' locations leaves more questions than it resolves. First of all, despite all of these 4000+ strong seniors being kidnapped -- sometimes forcibly -- from the comfort of their familial homes and dragged to a shady, unknown section of \"bum-ass Boston\", as one interviewed senior described it, the vast majority of high schoolers there were enjoying their stay. In fact, it seems that across the duration of their kidnapping and imprisonment, many students were able to form friendships and romantic relationships, with some even managing to get internships! Indeed, even when rescued and presented with the opportunity to free themselves, the vast majority of students actually chose to stay in the shadows of their captors, in what experts are terming the \"most advanced case of Stockholm Syndrome ever recorded\".\n\nFor now, all the rest of America can do is to pray for these lost souls to return to their senses and break free of their captors.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678331173.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Someone give NEU\u2019s tiktok intern a raise because what on earth?? \ud83d\ude2d","author":"thifting","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/7hbpssysthma1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678253669.0,"comments":[{"author":"CodeZero22","text":"They're definitely watching A2C","upvotes":57,"created_utc":1678257365.0},{"author":"wsbgodly123","text":"Rejects ivy EA acceptance and applied to NU.in","upvotes":26,"created_utc":1678270698.0},{"author":"tmarino721","text":"It\u2019s all just a ploy to distract us from their admissions practices\ud83e\udd2b","upvotes":21,"created_utc":1678281851.0},{"author":"Toenailes","text":"This is beautiful.

Johanthan Harvard. I had everything I could ever want in life, a lavish mansion in Maliboo, California, a fleet of luxury cars includin a lambo n g-wagon, and access to the finest things the world had to offer (diamonds, vapes, coke, etc). I was always on the move, jet-setting to exotic locations and living a life of luxury. Always being the Rizzard of Oz and the ultimate Rizzly Bear.  My rizz average was about a net positive + 9.7 every 12 hours. I thought I had it all, but I was wrong. \n\nOne day, I decided to take a break from my busy life and volunteered at a Christian mission in Kenya. I had heard so much about the work they were doing there, helping the impoverished people of the country. I thought it would be a great opportunity to give back and make a difference.\n\nAs soon as I arrived, I was struck by the poverty and suffering I saw around me. The people there were living in makeshift homes, struggling to survive without access to clean water, food, or basic medical care. It was a stark contrast to the opulent lifestyle I was used to.\n\nDespite the difficult living conditions, the people at the mission welcomed me with open arms. They showed me kindness and hospitality that I had never experienced before. They were happy, content with what they had, even though it was so little. They taught me the value of community, of being there for each other, of finding joy in the little things in life.\n\nI spent my days volunteering at the mission, helping to build homes and schools, providing food and water to those in need, and simply spending time with the people there. I met Gregory, a flaming hot, dark, handsome gay man. We may have had relations inside the Mission center's bathroom. (that\u2019s not important ) I learned so much from all of them them, and in turn, they showed me what it truly means to be happy. Not having racks but still being happy. Like bros is broke but still happy \ud83d\ude2dlowk rspect \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udc80\n\nOn my last day at the mission, as I said goodbye to the people I had grown to love, I realized that I had gained so much more than I had given. I had learned the true value of life, the importance of giving back, and the joy of living a simple, meaningful existence.\n\nAs I boarded my flight back to my lavish lifestyle, I log onto my A2C account and begin thinking about how I would never forget the lessons I had learned in Kenya. As I prepare to live my unfilling life again, I'll be gettin lit asf and gettin my back broken by men (as therapy as I miss Gregory). Furthermore, I will be continuing my academic and personal career at Harvard University, a small liberal arts school in the Northeast USA (my ancestors founded it).","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678332823.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"Please be careful of plagiarism when asking for essay reviews.

But in September, I flipped a coin, read some admissions blogs, wrote the SAT (somehow got a 790 on math) and submitted my app at 11:50pm on jan 5th.\n\nNo hate for people who have olympiads; I definitely think that everyone who has an olympiad must be **super duper genius-level big-brain** kind of smart, but I think that focusing on that one aspect might discourage people from applying.\n\nanyways just wanted to give some hope before pi day :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT\/UPDATE**: after reading all the pessimistic comments and personal anecdotes, I finally found ANOTHER admission officer at MIT who backs up the Dean's claims. Chris (who is an official MIT AO), posted this comment:\n\n>Off the top of my head, I\u2019d say that maybe half of the international students we admitted last year had some level of distinction in Olympiads and half didn\u2019t.

Being an international applicant is just being a fish in an ocean. There are just too many differences in every type of applicant even if that guy is \"international\". For example in Europe, the education system has more similarities to that of the USA where students have opportunities to build and learn as they grow up in high school. For these students, the holistic nature of application evaluations comes has an advantage. The thing of need to get an olympiad medal is most prominent in countries like India, China, etc. where the competition is just academically. The situation in India is 2x worse as that of china(my cousin lives in India). The parent's pressure to perform just academically and get a good scores in the entrance exams like JEE and NEET is too much. There are students who destroy their high school careers. They move out of their hometown at just 14 age. All they do is sit in their room and cram 3 subjects for whole 4 years. When MIT wants students who are achievers in every aspect of their life, these students are not even in consideration in the first place. Then to get the \"We have international diversity\" they admit the students who have placed gold medals in international olympiads as they are the most elite from the country.\n\nI also see a lot of Indians whining about how the JEE advanced is difficult and is just like international olympiads. No, It is not. International olympiads test the thinking and the creative capacity of one's mind. You have to utilize your brain's thinking power to solve those questions rather than just chunk 100 formulas and questions to get marks. What makes it worse is how badly the education system in India is developed. The coachings in India make false claims to every student among the 3 million that they are gonna get a good rank and a college.

I am an out of state applicant and overall the cost of tuition would be high as they have not given me a need based grant. My friend with a higher EFC got institutional grants which made his total COA lower than mine. \n\nA few days later, I get an email saying I need to do extra verification for my reported income. It was specifically my income, not my parents. They asked me for a W2 form when I reported my job. I worked at an internship over the summer in 2021, and I had to fill out a W9 form and was paid as a contractor for $1200. At the time, I thought that I didn\u2019t qualify for filing for taxes since my earned income was low and I was a minor. I checked again online recently and this seemed to be the case.\n\nI provided the W9 and a scanned copy of my check, materials that passed through IDOC without a problem as W2 substitutes, and the verification failed. I emailed the 3rd party company that was handling this, and they again told me to submit a W2 which I didn\u2019t have. So again I emailed and then they gave me a special form for No W2\u2019s, I submitted that, and now I have to make, file, and submit a Schedule C for 2021. \n\nI was wondering if:\n\n1) I have eligibility for filing Schedule C\n2) if I do, how should I do it?\n3) if I don\u2019t, what do I say? \n\nThank you so much!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678317808.0,"comments":[{"author":"purrgirl","text":"Did you receive a 1099 from the workplace? That seems like it would be the closest substitute for a W2. \n\nIf you really do need to fully file your 2021 taxes, then yes, you'd need to fill out a Schedule C as one of the forms you file. The Schedule C is just a form showing your business income. (as a contractor you are a business). You'd fill in the income you received ($1200) on the Schedule C and subtract any expenses you incurred for doing the work. Then you'd include that form, and the 1099, along with the the 1040 form, and submit it to the IRS.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678335684.0}]},{"title":"dropping a sport second semester","author":"wraithofwindypoplars","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/11mld3s\/dropping_a_sport_second_semester\/","text":"i put on my application that i would play a school sport from 9th to 12th grade, but now that spring sports season has come around i really really don't want to play. would it look bad if i quit the team? the thing is that my school puts athletic team membership on the transcript, so colleges would know i didn't play","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678344803.0,"comments":[{"author":"Fluffy_Appointment90","text":"unless you have an athletic scholarship don't sweat it","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678344907.0}]},{"title":"Just demolished a toilet at UW.

We have exciting news! This Friday afternoon, we will share admission notices with high school seniors who applied to UC Davis using the email listed on their UC application. Students can also check their status in MyAdmissions, our secure admission portal. While counselors can\u2019t access MyAdmissions, and we do not discuss admission decisions in advance, you can help your students understand what happens next.  \n\n\nAdmission to the UC Davis Class of 2027 is a great achievement! We hope that you and your school will take time to recognize those students who have reached this milestone. We encourage you, your school and your students to share admission shoutouts and reactions with **#New2UCDavis**\u2014you'll get a social media shoutout right back!

Admission notices for transfer applicants will go out in late-April, with an SIR deadline of June 1.  \n\n\nUC Davis received more than [94,000 applications for first-year admission](https:\/\/mx.technolutions.net\/ss\/c\/gsby7xed_Q9kJKoUKuDGdKi9wCSd-tHJJCVSTrkTp-Q3QSsgWw8WIlmADhfnFeY0y0zXwoMXc6rV8NQYCCHLFOmSAgBJvzukv9B6p0PM8MY\/3ub\/72ZhDswqRMatLLKUR7Dcfw\/h3\/q4Mnbofwjc6w4qUWtPreaaIMDyS7lOd2mD1Er7izlKk), and while we expect to grow the size of our incoming class by approximately 200 new students this fall, admission remained competitive. As a result, many highly qualified applicants were offered a space on our waitlist, or denied, due to space limitations. We want to encourage students who were [offered a space on our waitlist](https:\/\/mx.technolutions.net\/ss\/c\/gsby7xed_Q9kJKoUKuDGdFO5-pFrqskFnE9zjVpXRAvFX-PfXsrEh9jfuTuJw_lveTE-S7HWe_L0M7q_iT-6dR8vzDq-paMOa3Ki-4IiUG8\/3ub\/72ZhDswqRMatLLKUR7Dcfw\/h4\/5UAMtohOyXPVhJpy3_p1YaaV-jH3zAujVMWCb33wylg) to take advantage of that opportunity and opt-in by April 15. The waitlist remains a very viable opportunity for admission.  \n\n\nNot receiving an offer of admission can be tough news for students who had UC Davis high on their list. We know you\u2019ll [counsel them to chart their best option](https:\/\/mx.technolutions.net\/ss\/c\/gsby7xed_Q9kJKoUKuDGdFO5-pFrqskFnE9zjVpXRAvFX-PfXsrEh9jfuTuJw_lvn0GaG2nmN8wiKp-lUfOx7jEjeB8ROlnBdrOd56eWNTs\/3ub\/72ZhDswqRMatLLKUR7Dcfw\/h5\/AcrBTmRS738r4Pj0ceSZn9x4_OhESiy8E1tnk3J2K_8), including a look at the transfer pathway if attending UC Davis remains their goal. We do not encourage students to appeal their decisions; however, an appeal form is available in their MyAdmissions portal. Students who chose to appeal their decision should include ***new and compelling information that was not available in the original application*** that might have led to a different outcome. Standardized test scores will not be considered.  \n\n\nThis is just the first process of many that will determine our newly enrolled student body.

In this way, people won\u2019t doubt their credibility, and they\u2019ll be able to cement their status quickly, and stop themselves from being dislodged from their new rank.

Now for the next couple months I have to get my shit together and apply to colleges. I live in Virginia and I am a straight white male with a household income that disqualifies me from any financial aid (for context). I have a 1410 SAT, 4.91\/5 GPA, only like 2-3 classes in high school I didn\u2019t get an A+.

I would later switch my major to I business for my RD schools.\n\nThen December comes around, I open my UVA decision, and it\u2019s a deferral. Not the best news and since I really haven\u2019t applied to any safeties, I apply to 6 more school. Notre Dame, Georgia, FSU, USF, VT, and William and Mary.\n\nThen I get my URichmond decision. Thought this was a safety and the only way I\u2019m going is if I get a scholarship bc I\u2019m not paying 60k a year for tuition. I get deferred again and now I\u2019m really shitting my pants. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks, UNC, and Georgia Tech come out. Seeing how the acceptance rate for both schools were extremely low.

I also get accepted into their school. Finally now the RD decision are coming out. I get into USF, but then get wait listed from VT.

So schools are left trying to cover their costs while also not having to increase tuition for in state students because that looks bad. Plus, if a state does increase their in state tuition rate, then other states will try to raid their state because the raiding state can offer a scholarship that keeps the person paying more the raiding school would get from an instate student but still be below what that OOS student would be paying in their home state.

The problem is that in my country the last year of middle school is the first year of highschool in the US, so I only took what are considered \"regular\" classes because those are the only classes that my school offered. Then I came to the US in my sophomore year, but the problem is that I was only able to take regular classes because if I wanted to take APs\/Honors, I needed to physically take a placement exam and that was impossible for me because this was during the pandemic so I was not allowed to enter the US. So I had no Honors\/APs or anything like that for the first year of highschool in the US (Sophomore year) right now I'm a Junior and I'm taking 5 APs, and I am doing really well. The thing is that since universities don't really care about senior year, in reality, I was only able to take competitive classes for my junior year, and my GPA is, therefore, very \"low.\" \n\nI had a 4.0 in my first two years, but this year (which, as I said, is my first year taking advanced classes) I expect to end it with a 4.5 - 4 .6 W. But since I only took regular classes the first two years, the total GPA I'm going to submit to colleges is gonna be around 4.1 - 4.2 W, which is not THAT competitive.\n\nMy hope is that since I had a high PSAT and I expect to end my junior year with a high GPA, I can give colleges a strong case of why I have a \"low\" GPA, in which I pretty much wasn't in control of my situation, but through those two things, I can demonstrate that I could've had a much higher GPA, I just wasn't allowed to.\n\nIs there any hope for me?\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I wasn't allowed to take advanced courses in my first two years of high school, but I have a strong GPA in my junior year and a good PSAT.

After months of hard work and waiting, he finally received news from Northeastern University. As he nervously opened the email, he couldn't believe what he saw.\n\n\"Dear Minho, we regret to inform you that you have been deferred from the Early Action program.\"\n\nMinho's heart sank. He had worked so hard to get good grades, participate in extracurricular activities, and write a compelling essay. He had even been accepted to MIT Early Action, which was a huge accomplishment. But now, his future at Northeastern was uncertain.\n\nFeeling disappointed and frustrated, Minho went to talk to his guidance counselor. She was sympathetic and encouraged him to stay positive.\n\n\"Don't worry, Minho. You still have a chance to get in. Being deferred isn't the end of the world,\" she said.\n\nMinho nodded, still feeling uncertain. He knew he had to keep his options open and focus on his other college applications. But he couldn't help feeling a bit down. He had really liked Northeastern and had hoped to attend.\n\nOver the next few months, Minho worked hard on his other college applications, trying not to dwell too much on the deferred decision from Northeastern. But it was a reminder that even the most qualified and deserving students can face disappointment in the college admissions process.\n\n \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n \n\nEthan sat at his desk, staring at the acceptance letter from the University of Chicago. It was his dream school, the place he had always wanted to go. But now, as he looked at the letter, he couldn't shake the feeling of doubt that had been creeping in since his junior year.\n\nHis grades had slipped that year, due to some personal issues that had been weighing on him. He had worked hard to bring them back up, but he couldn't help wondering if it was enough.\n\n\"What if I can't handle it?\" he thought to himself. \"What if I'm not smart enough?\"\n\nJulie walked into the room, noticing the letter in Ethan's hand. \"What's up?\" she asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Ethan said, his voice uncertain. \"I'm just worried. What if I'm not good enough for UChicago?\"\n\nJulie sat down next to him, putting a hand on his shoulder. \"Ethan, you're one of the smartest people I know,\" she said. \"And you've worked so hard to get where you are. Don't let a few bad grades make you doubt yourself.\"\n\nEthan nodded, but the doubts still lingered in his mind. He had always been introspective, analytical, and prone to overthinking things. It was part of what made him a talented writer and poet, but it could also hold him back at times.\n\nJulie could see the worry etched on his face, and she knew that he needed a little push to believe in himself. \"Ethan,\" she said, \"you're going to UChicago because you're talented, hardworking, and deserving of this opportunity. You can handle it. And if you ever need help, you know that you can always come to me.\"\n\nEthan smiled at his sister, feeling a sense of reassurance wash over him. He knew that he had a supportive family and a group of friends who believed in him. He would work hard, take advantage of the resources available to him, and make the most of this incredible opportunity.\n\n\"Thanks, Julie,\" he said. \"You're right. I can handle it.\" And with that, he turned back to the acceptance letter, feeling a sense of excitement and anticipation building inside him.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***  \n   \n Ethan, Alex M, David, and Priya had been planning their Dungeons and Dragons game for weeks, and finally, the day had arrived. They had all brought their character sheets, dice, and snacks, and they were ready to dive into the adventure.\n\nEthan, the dungeon master, began to set the scene. \"You find yourselves in a dark forest, surrounded by mist. You can hear the sounds of animals rustling in the bushes around you. What do you do?\"\n\nAlex, playing as a rogue, immediately jumped in. \"I want to use my stealth to sneak around and see if I can spot any enemies.\"\n\nDavid, playing as a paladin, spoke up next. \"I'll follow Alex, but I want to be ready to protect the group if we encounter anything dangerous.\"\n\nPriya, playing as a wizard, nodded in agreement. \"I'll stay in the back and be ready to cast spells if we need them.\"\n\nEthan rolled some dice and looked at his notes. \"As you move deeper into the forest, you begin to hear the sound of rushing water. You come to a small stream, and on the other side, you can see a cave entrance. What do you do?\"\n\nThe group discussed their options, and eventually decided to cross the stream and explore the cave. Along the way, they encountered traps, monsters, and puzzles, all of which they tackled together.\n\nAs the hours passed, the group grew more and more invested in their characters and the story they were creating. They laughed, cheered, and strategized as they battled their way through the adventure.\n\nFinally, as the sun began to rise outside, Ethan brought the game to a close. \"Congratulations, you've defeated the dragon and saved the kingdom! What do you want to do now?\"\n\nThe group smiled and high-fived each other. \"Let's do it again next week,\" Alex said, and everyone agreed. They packed up their things and headed out, already looking forward to their next game.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEthan and Julie decided to throw a party at their house during winter break. They invited their close friends from Green Hills High, including Priya, Alicia, Mary, Sarah, and Alex M.\n\nThe night of the party, everyone arrived dressed in their holiday best. The house was decorated with twinkling lights and a giant tree in the corner.\n\nAs the night progressed, the living room turned into a dance floor with everyone showing off their moves to popular hits. Ethan manned the stereo while Julie handed out drinks.\n\nPriya, who was always up for a good time, suggested they play a game of Truth or Dare. Everyone agreed, and they gathered around in a circle.\n\nAlicia started things off by daring Ethan to do a belly dance, which he did without hesitation. Mary was dared to sing the chorus of her favorite song, while Alex was dared to tell a secret he'd never told anyone before.\n\nAs the night went on, the group grew closer and more comfortable with each other. They talked about their hopes and dreams for the future and shared embarrassing stories from their past.\n\nEventually, the party started to wind down, and the group began to say their goodbyes. As the guests left, Ethan and Julie felt grateful for their amazing friends and the memories they had made that night.\n\n **\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***  \n Raj sat at his desk, feeling overwhelmed by the college application process. He had received a deferral from UMich Early Action, and he was starting to feel like all of his hard work had been for nothing.\n\nJust then, his friend Priya walked into the room, a big smile on her face.\n\n\"Hey Raj, what's up?\" she asked.\n\nRaj sighed. \"A deferral from UMich,\" he said, holding up the envelope.\n\nPriya sat down next to him and put a comforting arm around his shoulder. \"I'm sorry, Raj. That really sucks. But remember, it's not the end of the road. There are plenty of great schools out there that would be lucky to have you.\"\n\nRaj nodded, grateful for Priya's support. \"Thanks, Priya. I know you're right, but it's hard to stay positive when I keep getting rejected.\"\n\nPriya smiled. \"I understand, Raj. But think of it this way - every rejection letter is just bringing you one step closer to the school that's meant for you. You're going to end up exactly where you're supposed to be.\"\n\nRaj couldn't help but smile at Priya's words. She had a way of making everything seem less daunting.\n\n\"You're right, Priya. Thanks for always being there for me.\"\n\nPriya squeezed his shoulder. \"Of course, Raj. We're in this together.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n Julie's hands were shaking as she stood in front of the microphone at the local coffee shop. It was open mic night and she had decided to share her passion for music with the audience. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and began strumming her guitar.\n\nThe room fell silent as Julie began to sing, her voice filling the space with warmth and emotion. She had written this song herself, pouring her heart and soul into every word. As she sang, she opened her eyes and looked out at the crowd, feeling a wave of nerves wash over her.\n\nBut the audience was captivated by Julie's performance, their eyes fixed on her as she sang. Some people tapped their feet to the beat, while others closed their eyes and swayed gently to the rhythm.\n\nMatthew was sitting in the front row, his eyes glued to Julie as she performed. He had always known that she was talented, but seeing her on stage like this was a whole other level. He felt a swell of pride in his chest, knowing that he was lucky enough to call her his friend.\n\nAs Julie finished the song, the crowd erupted into applause. Julie beamed as she stepped back from the microphone, feeling a wave of relief wash over her. She had done it. She had shared her music with the world.\n\nAs she walked back to her seat, Matthew gave her a standing ovation. \"That was incredible, Julie,\" he said, beaming.\n\nJulie blushed, feeling a warm sense of happiness spread through her body. \"Thank you,\" she said, feeling grateful to have such supportive friends.\n\nAs the night went on, the coffee shop was filled with music, laughter, and good cheer. But for Julie, the highlight of the evening had been sharing her music with the world, and she knew that this was just the beginning of her musical journey.\n\n \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n \n\nIt was a chilly afternoon and a group of friends, including Priya, Alex Chen, David, and Alicia, were gathered in the school library discussing the college admissions process. The topic of yield protection had just come up.\n\nDavid spoke first. \"I definitely think that colleges yield protect. It's just a way for them to increase their yield rate and make their acceptance rate look lower.\"\n\nAlicia chimed in. \"But isn't it unfair to the students who are qualified and really want to attend that school?\"\n\nPriya nodded. \"I agree with Alicia. Yield protection just seems like a way for colleges to play games with students' futures.\"\n\nAlex Chen added, \"But we also have to remember that colleges are businesses, and they have to think about their own interests as well.\"\n\nEthan, who had just arrived, overheard the conversation and interjected. \"I think it's important to consider that yield protection isn't always intentional. Sometimes schools just end up with a higher number of qualified applicants than they expected.\"\n\nJulie nodded in agreement. \"And sometimes it's just a matter of fit. Just because you're qualified doesn't mean you're the right match for the school.\"\n\nThe group continued to discuss the pros and cons of yield protection, with each student offering their own perspective. While they didn't come to a definitive conclusion, they all agreed that the college admissions process can be unpredictable and sometimes unfair.\n\nAs they packed up their books and headed out of the library, Alicia turned to the group and said, \"Whatever happens with college admissions, we'll all end up where we're meant to be. And we'll have each other to lean on along the way.\"\n\nThe others nodded in agreement and smiled, feeling grateful for their friendship and support system.\n\n \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n \n\nDavid stepped out of the car and looked around at the sprawling campus of the University of Michigan. He had flown in from New York for an official visit to the school, which was also interested in recruiting him for their football team.\n\nAs they walked through the campus, David's father talked to him about the advantages of playing football at Michigan. \"It's a great school, and they have a really strong football program,\" he said. \"Plus, you'll be a lot closer to home.\"\n\nDavid nodded, taking it all in. He had already been accepted to Stanford to play football, which was his dream school, but he had to admit that he was impressed by Michigan as well.\n\nThey went to meet with Coach Jim Harbaugh and to tour the facilities. As they walked through the locker room, David felt a rush of excitement. He could see himself playing for this team and being a part of the Wolverines community.\n\nAfter the tour, they headed to a meeting with the admissions office. David was pleasantly surprised to find out that he had been accepted to the university as well, which was a huge relief. He had been worried about not getting in anywhere if football didn't work out.\n\nAs they left the campus, David was deep in thought. He had a tough decision to make. Stanford had always been his dream, but Michigan was a close second. He loved the campus, the football program, and the community.\n\nIt was a tough choice, but David knew he had to make it soon. He was excited about the prospect of playing football in college, but he also wanted to make sure he was going to the best school for him.\n\n **\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***  \n \n\nThe night before, snow began to fall steadily, and by morning, Green Hills High School had announced a snow day. All the students rejoiced, knowing they could stay in bed instead of trudging through the snow to get to school.\n\nEthan and Julie woke up to the sound of their parents cheering and celebrating in the living room. They groggily stumbled out of bed and joined them, already anticipating a day full of movies, board games, and hot cocoa.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary, who lived closer to the school, decided to take advantage of the snow day by going outside and taking a walk through the nearby woods. She pulled on her boots, jacket, hat, and gloves and headed outside, relishing the peaceful stillness that the snowfall brought.\n\nPriya, on the other hand, saw the snow day as an opportunity to catch up on some studying. She had a big exam coming up and needed to review some material. She brewed herself a cup of coffee and settled in at her desk, determined to make the most of her day off.\n\nAlicia and Raj decided to take advantage of the snow by having a snowball fight in the backyard. They bundled up and headed outside, laughing and chasing each other through the snow.\n\nMeanwhile, Minho spent the day working on a programming project that he had been meaning to get to. He was grateful for the extra time that the snow day provided him and worked diligently on his code throughout the day.\n\nAs the day wore on, the snow continued to fall, and the students settled in for a cozy night at home, enjoying each other's company and the warmth of the fire. They knew that they would have to make up the missed day eventually, but for now, they were content to just relax and enjoy the snow day.\n\n **\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***  \n \n\nMinho's heart was pounding as he checked his email. He had applied to Caltech and Northeastern, and he was eagerly waiting for a response. He had dreamed of attending Caltech for years, and he had poured his heart and soul into his application.\n\nWhen he saw the email from Caltech, he could hardly contain his excitement. He had been accepted! He was thrilled beyond words and couldn't wait to tell his family and friends.\n\nBut as he kept scrolling through his inbox, he saw another email. This one was from Northeastern, and his heart sank as he read the words: \"We regret to inform you that you have been placed on the waitlist.\"\n\nMinho felt a mix of emotions - disappointment, frustration, and confusion. He knew that getting waitlisted wasn't necessarily a rejection, but it still stung. He had worked hard throughout high school and had hoped that his strong academic record and extracurricular activities would secure his spot at Northeastern.\n\nHe felt a sudden urge to talk to someone about it, and he decided to call his friend Priya. She had been through a similar experience with Brown, and he knew that she would understand how he was feeling.\n\n\"Hey Minho, what's up?\" Priya answered the phone.\n\n\"Hey Priya, I just got accepted to Caltech!\" Minho exclaimed.\n\nPriya's voice lit up. \"That's amazing, congratulations! You must be so excited!\"\n\nMinho couldn't help but smile at her enthusiasm. \"Yeah, I am. But I also just got waitlisted at Northeastern. I don't know what to do.\"\n\nPriya listened patiently as Minho talked through his feelings. She reminded him that getting waitlisted wasn't the end of the world, and that he still had a chance of being accepted. She also encouraged him to focus on the positive - his acceptance to Caltech was a huge accomplishment.\n\nAs Minho hung up the phone, he felt a sense of gratitude for having such a supportive friend. He knew that no matter what happened with Northeastern, he had a bright future ahead of him at MIT or Caltech.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678292877.0,"comments":[{"author":"Dense_Gate1340","text":"Thank you.

Realistically considering how many you can afford & have time to put real effort into applying to. USNews and other rankings are deeply flawed but can at least be a good jumping off point for getting familiar with some names. I recommend niche because i found their format for individual school profiles, and the category based rankings they had, very helpful even if the methodologies aren\u2019t perfect.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to know what ur gonna major in but it helps to think you know\u2026 as in, pick one you reasonably might do as of now and try to structure your app (especially to top schools, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re aiming for) around it so you seem extra determined\/like you have a coherent narrative. Most schools don\u2019t admit by major and you can find out if one you\u2019re applying to does with a little research and go from there.\n\nYou will spend a lot of time here (maybe unless you choose sanity lol) and on the internet generally finding advice for specific things.\n\nFor ur apps you need to get ur Common App Personal Essay out of the way first, start brainstorming ideas and how it might connect to either tentative narrative major or just the impression of yourself you want to give\n\nAlso don\u2019t procrastinate bro i submitted my princeton app at the last minute and my supplemental essays were \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\n\nDon\u2019t procrastinate financial aid either. If you are a US citizen (or other categories that are also included i can\u2019t quite remember) you need to fill out FAFSA. To get government aid and posible subsidized loans if you need them. You will need your parents tax information (for you, it\u2019ll be 2022s tax info) to fill it out. if one of ur parents has more custody of you than the other, it may only ask for one parents info, but make sure these tax documents are relatively accessible (1040s and W2s usually, unless ur parents have a weird situation like owning a business or farm) so you aren\u2019t rushing\/missing priority deadlines.\n\nAlso don\u2019t accidentally fill out the wrong year for FAFSA cause i did that and all my work went to waste and i had to start over lol. Just cause i wasn\u2019t paying attention.\n\nFinancial aid 2.0 that caused me to miss many priority deadlines was the CSS Profile. Again, i reiterate, get tax documents EARLY!!! FAFSA is EZ compared to CSS, CSS is torture lol. Regardless of custody\/marriage whatever you will need all parental tax documents, including if ur custodial parent has remarried. And if you have a non custodial parent who works you will also need their taxes for it. Some (small number) of schools don\u2019t ask for CSS but if you apply to a variety of schools and\/or top schools you\u2019ll prob run into it at least once. \n\nthen financial aid 3.0 the IDOC. All the tax documents you needed to gather up to get all ur parents (and maybe your? if you have a paid job or invest or something?) now need to be photocopied (i just took pics of every page individually with my phone and it worked fine tho) so that some colleges can lile prove that i wasn\u2019t lying about everything else i just said (why even ask for it then, right??? lol) and a couple PDFs or printable documents they\u2019ll want you to print, fill out, and photocopy right back in again. Sigh.\n\nfinancial aid 4.0 some colleges want your delicious documents but do not want them through the IDOC because reasons\u2026 so CSS will tell you \u201cyou gotta log into these colleges portals and fill out their own stuff\u201d so you go do that\n\nalso you may very well have to walk school guidance counselors through processes \ud83e\udee5 just try to get through it with grace \n\nget a planner or start using ur devices calendar religiously, you want to keep all ur deadlines straight along with your senior year coursework. no you cant start slipping now, colleges can and will rescind you for a significant decline in work. \n\nhumm overall it\u2019s been alrigjt enough. doing it mostly on my own also means less expectations at least, lol.\n\ngood luck!!! pls msg me once you get there if you need anything, im no expert but i sure know a lot more now than i once did!","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1678246311.0},{"author":"jetblacktrillionaire","text":"I pretty much went through the same process u\/Binlong14 did, but in the span of 45 days (mid November to December). #internationalthings","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678259287.0},{"author":"saggyalarmclock","text":"procrastinator pov tbh\n\nI created a spreadsheet with all of the essays, scholarships, app dates, app costs, and \\[personal\\] rankings before I even started\n\nOCT - My state (VA) has a free application week in October where students could apply to instate schools and a couple select privates at no cost.

I come from a small town in India, and until my 8th grade I had no idea that I can study my bachelor's abroad. In 8th grade, I wrote some national Olympiad thing which was conducted by some school+ coaching institute called Allen, and in their brochure, they talked about how their students went to MIT. That was the first time I heard about MIT, and then when I realized that there are better colleges outside of India, I was like okay cool, I'll go there. Fast forward to my 11th grade, I started searching about MIT. I googled, googled and googled, and got to know about the SAT and TOEFL. It took me many days to convince my parents, apply for passport and the exams. Took my sat on the last possible date, 4th of December 2021 and scored  1450(800M) with no prep except for Khan academy. Then I contacted my school which had no idea that we can apply to colleges outside India. Spent almost an hour in the school office like 3 days before the deadline and taught them how to create an account and stuff. Back then, my principal's common app password was my name. Made them upload the docs and then I contacted my 10th grade teachers for an LOR, and my second teacher uploaded an LOR on the day of my first deadline, Jan 1st. I applied to MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Caltech and NYU. Okay I might sound insane but back then I had no idea about how competitive this shit is and I expected Harvard to accept me just because of the essay I wrote about my interest in CS. I thought I was the only one applying to us unis from India cuz no one I knew had any idea about undergrad in US, and I thought colleges did not care about me needing literally full aid. Until I submitted my first application, I did not even know if I had a fee waiver or not. \n\nFast forward to March, I got rejected from all five and I got into Clemson where I later applied. Thought of attending Clemson but dropped the idea cuz of the cost. Looked at diff countries from March to June, and I got into the best state school in my state. My mom saw my interest in going to US and encouraged me to take a gap year and try properly for US. I took the suggestion, and now this year, I planned well in advance, and as of now, it is going decently.

Yale podcast also slays.\n* If you have a fee waiver or money to pay the fee for multiple universities and are willing to apply to more than the 20 schools Common App allows, then apply to all of them. Separate your list between safe, reach, and target but also in priority. If there's a school you are not so interested to apply, only apply to it if you finished your priorities already.\n* Read. A. Lot. Of. Essays. If there's no one helping you to write them and you feel like you ran out of places to read for tips and instructions, go and find yourself some examples: you will learn by it.\n* Remember to touch grass. This process is mentally (and sometimes bodily) draining. Take some time outs, go get some sun on your face. You can even stay inside and scream to your favorite song or cry to the saddest drama movie ever (Legally Blonde).\n* Don't over daydream. It will be horrible because when the fear arrives, it will be even worse lol\n* Talk to 2-3 teachers, if not all are willing to help you, and ask them if they could write a letter of recommendation. If they accept, ask if it's ok for you to send them a list of remarkable moments you had together and that you think would fit in the letter of recommendation. Mostly, they accept it.

We found this: \n\n9 applicants got into at least 1 top 15 school if an applicant only applied to one of H or Y and received one interview from Harvard or Yale\n\n14 applicants got into at least 1 t15 if an applicant applied to both and got an interview from only 1\/2. \n\n16 applicants got into at least 1 t15 if an applicant applied to both and got an interview from both. \n\n14 applicants got into at least 1 t15 if an applicant applied to both and got no interview. \n\nOnly 26.5% of people who applied to h and\/or y and and got into a t15 didn\u2019t receive an interview and none got into HYPSM.

She had applied Early Decision to Brown University, her top choice school, and was eagerly waiting for a response. She had worked tirelessly throughout high school, earning excellent grades and test scores, and had poured her heart and soul into her application.\n\nBut when the decision finally arrived in the portal, Priya's heart sank. She had been deferred. She read the letter over and over again, feeling a lump form in her throat. Priya knew that being deferred wasn't necessarily a rejection, but it still hurt.\n\nJust then, Mary walked into the library, a big smile on her face. Priya's heart sank even further as she realized that Mary had received her Early Decision acceptance to Brown.\n\n\"Hey Priya!\" Mary said excitedly, pulling up a chair. \"Guess what? I got in! I'm going to Brown next fall!\"\n\nPriya tried to force a smile but couldn't help feeling jealous and disappointed. Mary was a double legacy at Brown, and although she was an excellent student, Priya had better grades and test scores. It didn't seem fair.\n\n\"That's great, Mary,\" Priya said, trying to sound enthusiastic.\n\nMary noticed that something was off. \"Hey, are you okay?\" she asked, looking concerned.\n\nPriya hesitated for a moment before finally admitting, \"I got deferred from Brown.\"\n\nMary's expression softened. \"Oh Priya, I'm so sorry. That must be really tough.\"\n\nPriya shrugged, trying to play it off. \"Yeah, it's not a rejection, but it's not an acceptance either. I just don't know what to do now.\"\n\nMary leaned in. \"Listen, you're an amazing student, and you have so much going for you. You're going to end up exactly where you're meant to be, I just know it.\"\n\nPriya couldn't help feeling a little bit better after talking to Mary. She knew that Mary wasn't trying to make her feel bad, and that Mary's acceptance was just a result of her being a legacy. It didn't mean that Mary wasn't a great student too.\n\nAs they both got up to leave, Mary gave Priya a hug. \"You're going to end up somewhere amazing, I just know it,\" she repeated.\n\nAs Priya left the library, she couldn't help but feel a little bit more hopeful. Even though things hadn't worked out the way she had hoped, she knew that there were still plenty of opportunities out there for her.\n\n**Columbia**\n\nAlex felt their heart pounding as they logged onto their Columbia applicant portal. They had been waiting anxiously for weeks to find out the decision on their Early Decision application, and now the moment had arrived.\n\nAs they clicked the button to view their decision, their eyes scanned the page for any indication of their admission status. And there it was - the word \"deferred\" in bold letters.\n\nAlex's heart sank. They had been so sure that Columbia was the right fit for them, and now they were faced with uncertainty and disappointment. They couldn't help but feel like they had let themselves and their family down.\n\nBut as they took a deep breath and read through the rest of the decision letter, a glimmer of hope began to emerge. The letter explained that their application would be reviewed again during the regular decision round, and that they would receive a final decision by the end of March.\n\nAlex knew that being deferred wasn't a rejection, and that they still had a chance to be admitted to Columbia. They decided to channel their disappointment into motivation, and began to work on strengthening their application for the regular decision round.\n\nAs they closed their laptop, Alex reminded themselves that no matter what happened with their college admissions, they were capable and talented, and that they had many options available to them. They resolved to keep pushing forward and to make the most of whatever opportunities came their way.\n\n**Harvard**\n\n**(Matthew)**\n\nMatthew sat in his bedroom, staring at the acceptance letter from Harvard University. It was his dream school, and he had been accepted Early Action, which was a huge relief. But as he read through the financial aid package, his heart sank.\n\nThe tuition, room, and board costs were astronomical, and even with the financial aid that Harvard was offering, it still wasn't enough for him to afford the school. Matthew knew that his parents couldn't afford to help him pay for it, and he didn't want to be buried in debt for years to come.\n\nFeeling overwhelmed, Matthew took a deep breath and called his guidance counselor, Ms. Johnson.\n\n\"Hey, Ms. Johnson. I got accepted to Harvard Early Action, but the financial aid isn't enough. What should I do?\"\n\nMs. Johnson listened patiently and then asked Matthew about the financial aid package and any other opportunities.\n\nMs. Johnson could sense Matthew's disappointment and asked, \"Have you considered appealing the financial aid decision?\"\n\nMatthew hadn't even thought about that as a possibility. He didn't know that he could appeal the decision.\n\nMs. Johnson explained the process and encouraged Matthew to gather any additional financial information that could help his appeal. She also suggested that he reach out to the financial aid office at Harvard to discuss his situation and see if there was anything else they could do to help him.\n\nFeeling hopeful, Matthew thanked Ms. Johnson and immediately got to work on gathering the additional financial information he needed. He also reached out to the financial aid office at Harvard to discuss his situation.\n\n\\*\\*(Alex M)\\*\\*Alex Madrigal sat at his desk, staring at the letter he had just received from Harvard from the portal. He had applied Early Action, hoping to increase his chances of getting accepted into one of the most prestigious universities in the world. But the letter was not what he had hoped for.\n\n\"Deferred?\" he muttered to himself. \"What does that even mean?\"\n\nHe turned to his computer, frantically searching for an explanation. As he read more, he began to feel disheartened. Being deferred meant that he was not accepted or rejected outright, but his application would be reconsidered in the regular admissions cycle. It was not a guarantee that he would get in.\n\nHe couldn't help but feel disappointed. Harvard had been his dream school for as long as he could remember. He had worked tirelessly in high school to earn good grades, take challenging courses, and build a strong extracurricular profile. He had spent months perfecting his application, crafting essays that he hoped would set him apart from other applicants.\n\nBut now, he felt like all that work had been for nothing. He wondered if he had done something wrong or if he wasn't good enough. He knew that getting into Harvard was a long shot, but he had allowed himself to believe that he had a chance.\n\nHe sighed and leaned back in his chair. He knew that he couldn't dwell on this disappointment for too long. He had other applications to work on, other schools to consider. He pulled up his list of colleges and began to think about which ones he would apply to next.\n\nAs he typed, he couldn't help but feel a bit resentful of the college admissions process. It was so stressful and uncertain, and it seemed like so much of it was out of his control. But he knew that he couldn't give up. He had come too far to let one setback hold him back. He would keep working, keep trying, and hope for the best.\n\n**Stanford**  \nDavid was sitting in his room, refreshing his email inbox, anxiously waiting for a response from Stanford. He had applied Early Action to the university and had been eagerly waiting for weeks to hear back.\n\nFinally, an email from Stanford popped up telling him to check the portal. David opened up the portal for a \"status update\" David's heart raced as he clicked on it and read the first few lines.\n\n\"Congratulations! We are pleased to offer you admission to Stanford University and a spot on our football team.\"\n\nDavid couldn't believe it. He had always dreamed of playing football at a top-tier university like Stanford, and now it was actually happening. He jumped up from his chair and ran to tell his parents the good news.\n\nDavid's parents were overjoyed when they heard the news. They knew how much this meant to David, and they were thrilled that he would be able to attend such a prestigious university while also pursuing his passion for football.\n\nOver the next few weeks, David worked hard to finalize his plans for attending Stanford. He met with his football coach to discuss his role on the team and started to look for housing options near campus.\n\nAs the reality of attending Stanford sunk in, David felt a mixture of excitement and nervousness. He knew that playing football at such a high level would be a challenge, but he was ready to put in the work.\n\n**Yale**  \nRaj sat at his desk, staring at the letter on his computer screen. He had applied Early Action to Yale, his dream school, and had been eagerly waiting for the decision to come out. But when he saw the word \"regret\" in the subject line of the letter, his heart sank.\n\nHe read it over and over again, trying to make sense of it. How could this be happening? He had worked so hard in high school, earning top grades and test scores, and had poured his heart and soul into his application.\n\nAs he sat there, feeling lost and disappointed, his phone buzzed with a text from his best friend, Alex.\n\n\"Hey man, have you heard back from Yale yet?\" the message read.\n\nRaj's heart sank even further. He didn't want to have to tell Alex the bad news.\n\n\"Yeah, I got rejected,\" he typed back.\n\nThere was a long pause before Alex replied.\n\n\"Damn, I'm sorry to hear that,\" Alex said. \"But hey, it's not the end of the world. You're an amazing student and you're going to end up somewhere great, I just know it.\"\n\nRaj appreciated the words of encouragement, but he still couldn't shake the feeling of disappointment. He had worked so hard for this, and now it felt like it had all been for nothing.\n\nHe closed his computer and decided to take a walk to clear his head. As he walked, he thought about all the other schools he had applied to, and tried to remind himself that there were still plenty of opportunities out there for him.\n\nAnd as he walked back home, he couldn't help but feel a little bit more hopeful. Even though he had been rejected from his dream school, he knew that he was still capable of achieving great things, and that his future was still full of endless possibilities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Duke**\n\nJulie had applied Early Decision to Duke University, her dream school. She had visited the campus several times, and everything about the university seemed perfect to her. She was anxiously waiting for the decision, refreshing her email inbox every few minutes.\n\nWhen the decision finally arrived on the Duke portal, her heart sank. Julie had been deferred. She read the letter over and over again, trying to make sense of it. She knew that being deferred wasn't a rejection, but it still felt like one. She had worked so hard throughout high school, and Duke was the only school she really wanted to attend.\n\nFeeling upset and disappointed, Julie decided to take a walk outside to clear her head. As she walked, she saw some of her classmates chatting and laughing, seemingly carefree. Julie couldn't help but feel envious of their joy and ease.\n\nJust then, her friend Priya appeared. \"Hey Julie,\" Priya said, smiling. \"What's up?\"\n\nJulie tried to force a smile but couldn't hold back her tears any longer. \"I got deferred from Duke,\" she said, her voice shaking.\n\nPriya immediately pulled Julie into a hug. \"I'm sorry, Julie. That's really tough,\" she said.\n\nJulie tried to compose herself. \"I just don't know what to do now,\" she said. \"Duke was the only school I really wanted to go to.\"\n\nPriya nodded sympathetically. \"I know how you feel. But remember, you're an amazing student, and you have so much going for you. You're going to end up where you're meant to be.\"\n\nJulie wiped away her tears and took a deep breath. \"Thanks, Priya. I needed to hear that.\"\n\nPriya smiled. \"Anytime. And if you ever want to talk, I'm here for you.\"\n\nFeeling a little bit better, Julie headed back inside the school. She knew that she still had other options, and she was determined to make the most of them. Even though things hadn't gone according to plan, she was determined to keep moving forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Georgetown**\n\nAlicia sat nervously at her desk, refreshing her email inbox every few seconds. She had applied Early Action to Georgetown University, her top choice school, and had been anxiously waiting for weeks for a response.\n\nFinally, the email arrived, there was a \"status update\" on Gerogetown's portal. Alicia's heart raced as she clicked on the status update. She read the first line and her heart leaped. She had been accepted!\n\nTears of joy streamed down her face as she called out to her parents, who were downstairs in the kitchen. They came rushing up the stairs to see what was happening.\n\n\"Alicia, what's going on?\" her mother asked, concerned.\n\n\"I got in! I got into Georgetown!\" Alicia exclaimed, showing them the email.\n\nHer parents hugged her tightly, overjoyed for their daughter. \"We're so proud of you, honey,\" her father said, wiping away his own tears.\n\nAlicia's mind raced as she thought about all the possibilities that this acceptance would bring. She had worked so hard throughout high school, and now her dream of attending Georgetown was finally a reality.\n\nAs she prepared to start the next chapter of her life, Alicia felt a sense of excitement and gratitude wash over her. She couldn't wait to see what the future held, and was grateful for the opportunity to attend such an amazing university.\n\n**MIT**\n\nMinho was sitting in his bedroom when he heard a notification sound from his phone. He jumped out of bed and picked up his phone to check the notification. It was an email from MIT, his dream school - there was a status update on the portal. He could feel his heart beating fast as he checked the status update, hoping to see the words he had been waiting for: \"Congratulations, you have been accepted to MIT.\"\n\nAnd there it was, right in front of him. He had been accepted to MIT Early Action. Minho couldn't contain his excitement and let out a loud whoop of joy. He quickly called his parents and told them the news, who were just as excited as he was.\n\nMinho had worked tirelessly for years, attending math and science competitions and studying tirelessly for the SAT and AP exams. He knew that MIT was a long shot, but he was determined to try his best. And now, all of his hard work had paid off.\n\nAs he sat there, still processing the news, Minho couldn't help but feel grateful for all of the support he had received from his family, friends, and teachers. Without their encouragement, he wouldn't have been able to achieve such a monumental accomplishment.\n\nBut now, he had a new challenge to face: deciding which school to attend. Even though MIT was his dream school, he was still waiting to hear from other schools Regular Decision, including Harvard and Stanford. But in his heart, he knew that MIT was the perfect fit for him.\n\nWith a newfound sense of purpose, Minho began planning his future at MIT. He knew that he had a lot of hard work ahead of him, but he was ready for the challenge. And as he looked out the window at the beautiful view of his hometown, Minho knew that his future was bright and full of possibilities.\n\n**Northwestern**\n\nSarah sat in her room, nervously refreshing her email inbox. She had applied Early Decision to Northwestern University, her top choice school, and was anxiously waiting for a response. She had worked so hard throughout high school, earning top grades and test scores, and had poured her heart and soul into her application.\n\nBut when the status update on the portal finally arrived, Sarah's heart sank. She had been deferred. She felt a lump form in her throat as she read the email over and over again. Sarah knew that being deferred wasn't necessarily a rejection, but it still stung.\n\nJust then, her sister walked into the room, a concerned look on her face. \"Hey, are you okay?\" she asked.\n\nSarah forced a smile, but inside she felt a mix of disappointment and anxiety. \"I got deferred from Northwestern,\" she said, trying to keep her voice steady.\n\nHer sister sat down next to her. \"I'm sorry to hear that,\" she said sympathetically. \"But remember, it's not a no. You still have a chance.\"\n\nSarah nodded, but couldn't shake the feeling of uncertainty. She had put all of her hopes into Northwestern, and now she wasn't sure what would happen next. Would she have to wait until the regular decision round to find out? Would she need to apply to other schools just in case?\n\nAs she lay in bed that night, Sarah's mind raced with thoughts and worries. She knew that she would need to come up with a plan, and fast. But for now, she just needed to process this new information and try to stay positive. After all, being deferred wasn't the end of the road - it was just a detour.\n\n**UChicago**\n\nEthan had been waiting anxiously for months for the Early Decision result from his dream school, the University of Chicago. He had spent countless hours working on his application and had poured his heart and soul into every essay.\n\nWhen he received the email notification that his decision was available, his heart started racing. He took a deep breath and checked the portal for a status update.\n\n\"Congratulations, Ethan! We are thrilled to offer you admission to the University of Chicago as a member of the Class of 2027.\"\n\nEthan felt a wave of relief and excitement wash over him. He had gotten in! He couldn't believe it.\n\nHe immediately called his twin sister, Julie, to share the good news. She picked up after the first ring, sounding anxious.\n\n\"Ethan, what's going on?\" Julie asked.\n\n\"I got in, Julie! I got into UChicago!\" Ethan exclaimed.\n\nThere was a pause on the other end of the line, and then Julie's voice was shaking as she replied, \"That's amazing, Ethan. Congratulations.\"\n\nEthan could tell that something was off with Julie, but he didn't want to press her about it. They talked for a few more minutes, and then Ethan hung up, feeling overjoyed.\n\nAs he went about his day, he couldn't stop smiling. He had worked so hard for this moment, and it felt amazing to know that his hard work had paid off.\n\nEthan immediately started planning his next steps - he would need to accept the offer and start thinking about housing and course registration. But for the moment, he was content to just bask in the glow of his success.\n\nTL;DR  \n**Results**  \nPriya: Deferred from Brown ED  \nMary: Accepted at Brown ED  \nAlex C: Deferred from Columbia ED  \nMatthew: Accepted at Harvard REA (but FA package disappointing)  \nAlex M: Deferred from Harvard REA  \nDavid: Accepted at Stanford REA (recruited to football team)  \nRaj: Rejected from Yale REA  \nAlicia: Accepted at Georgetown EA  \nJulie: Deferred from Duke ED  \nMinho: Accepted at MIT EA  \nSarah: Deferred from Northwestern ED  \nEthan: Accepted at UChicago ED","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678276978.0,"comments":[{"author":"wsbgodly123","text":"Poor Raj.

You do not know what will happen in the future, so deciding to \"stay positive\" or \"be realistic\/pessimistic\" would just be playing a mind game with yourself. On some level you know this, so you can't decide what path to take. Such mind games can be helpful if your behavior continued to matter in the outcome, a form of a self- fulfilling prophecy. You will notice that elite athletes have a very positive mindset- they are going to win and so they are more apt to do well. In your case, however, the action phase is done and you are simply waiting for the outcome. The only reality as of now is not knowing- uncertainty. Uncertainty is inescapable in life and yet it makes many people anxious. Knowledge makes us feel safer and it was very helpful when daily survival was a challenge. But uncertainty in this situation involves no real threat. It's a perfect situation to practice (and it does take a ton of practice) accepting that you do not know what will happen. Your mind will try to drift to \"what if's\", trying to predict the future and you will become anxious. Keep nudging your thoughts back to \"I don't know what will happen. I am not in control of what happens. This is a normal state in life and I can accept it. I can handle whatever happens\".

Pros and cons listed below: \n\nIntended major: CS for both CSUs, unsure what I could study at CC\n\nSimilarities: Both are in California in general, and I\u2019m most likely going to be going to a smaller school regardless of whether it\u2019s CC or a 4 year \n\nCA CC\nCommunity college Pros:\nI feel like I would get more academic support at a community college than at a four-year, particularly in math, which has been my biggest struggle (finished with Ds in algebra 2 and precalculus) \n\nI wouldn\u2019t have to do as many CS courses at a community college compared to a CSU since USD is a LAC for the first two years and it would be more general math \n\nCC courses would be pretty much guaranteed to transfer over because I\u2019m not sure if CSU courses would transfer \n\nCommunity college Cons:\n\n- All the small (less than 8,000 students) CCs are either way up north or have a lot of part-time students which means that I might have to deal with bigger classes, and the only CC with dorms that I know of in SoCal (where I\u2019ll be living come June) has more than 8,000 students \n\nI wouldn\u2019t get a proper first semester college experience, but at the same time I feel like it\u2019s a worthy sacrifice to get into a better school \n\nIf I don\u2019t meet the requirements or still don\u2019t get into USD after one semester I\u2019ll have to stay at a CC for two years instead of just a semester\n\n\nCal Stare Pros:\n\nI would have a normal college experience, which my dad in particular is pushing me towards trying to have, and if I don\u2019t end up getting into USD I\u2019ll at least have a safety net instead of staying at CC\n\nSchool 2 Cons:\n\n- I got into both CSUs for CS, which means that I\u2019ll have to take a lot of math\/CS courses in general which I worry could negatively affect my GPA, unless I can somehow try to take as little math as possible 1st semester at a CSU, and I\u2019m not sure if I can get as much academic help at a CSU compared to a CC\n\nCSU courses might not transfer as easily compared to a community college \n\n**Tiebreaking considerations:**\n\nI am still waiting on three schools (Chapman, the U of San Francisco, and the U of Redlands) and if I get into either one I\u2019ll still try and transfer but I\u2019d at least be content with going for all four years if shit hits the fan, but I highly doubt I\u2019ll get into any of those schools \n\n**Addendum:** I would prefer to stay in Southern\/Central CA (central only for CSUMB) and although cost isn\u2019t a factor at all, it would be cheaper to go to a CCC since I\u2019m paying OOS tuition for my first year at a CSU before I can get residency since my family and I are permanently moving to CA this summer","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678285233.0,"comments":[{"author":"PopOk1207","text":"Start by laying out all the class graduation requirements then look at what the overlap in courses with the CC's.

The service is *free* and incredibly in-depth. \n\n* All the U.S. colleges are in the system and you can search with myriad filters: major, public\/private, college type, program length, admission rates, cost, region, academics, limited sports, etc. \n* Fill out your profile as completely as you can. Plug in your stats and ECs and see which schools are your reach, hard target, target and safeties. \n* Watch live streams and archived videos about specific colleges and different aspects of the  application process. I recommend this for your parents too. I found these incredibly empowering.\n* Schedule free 1:1 consultations for essay reviews, maximizing financial aid, your school list,   your extracurriculars, etc.\n\nCheck out [CollegeVine's landing page for Juniors](https:\/\/www.collegevine.com\/guidance).\n\nOnce you've registered and filled out your profile, [connect with their advisors here](https:\/\/www.collegevine.com\/experts\/browse).

All the data is interesting but for you, the most relevant bit is **Section C - First time, First-Year Admission**. *(CollegeVine undoubtedly has this data in their system.)* \n* Look at **section C5** to make sure your coursework meets their **Units Recommended** numbers.\n* I know CollegeVine displays **section C7** but take a look at this too. C7 lists the importance of academic and nonacademic factors. It also helps to know if they consider level of applicant interest. (For example, attending online informational panels is a zero cost, high value way to demonstrate interest.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EXTRACURRICULARS**\n\nYou're academically strong but you're concerned about your ECs. The Common App has a section for Academic Honors and 10 slots for your ECs. \n\nCollegeVine breaks down your activities into 4 tiers. [Read this blog post](https:\/\/blog.collegevine.com\/breaking-down-the-4-tiers-of-extracurricular-activities\/) to learn how colleges evaluate your ECs. This information will help you grasp the importance of juxtapositional depth, progression, the four tiers and the benefits of a contrast profile. As you correctly noted, **quality matters more than quantity**.\n\nIn addition to what you listed in your original post, **do a complete inventory** of your ALL of your activities. Then you shape your final list into a cohesive narrative. Use those juicy high-impact resume words to communicate your skills in these domains: management, communication, research, technical, financial, creative, helping, detailed-oriented: \n\n* school activities\n* community activities\n* talents\n* hobbies\n* employment\n* family responsibilities\n* summer activities\n* academic honors\n\nSet up a simple table with these columns\n\n**Honors and awards**\n\n* Name of award\n* Grades\n* Description\n\n**Activities**\n\n* Position *(50 characters)*\n* Grades (9, 10, 11, 12)\n* Positions and responsibilities *(150 characters)*\n* Note: If any of your activities were started before 9th grade, fit that into your description. For example, you did taekwondo in 9th and 10th grade. But you actually practiced from grades 7 - 10.

People on this sub can probably relate to that, and it sounds like there's an intersection between my problem and yours: fearing a lack of social validation in the case of \"not doing enough.\"\n\nWhat I've found helpful is essentially introspection--not in the sense of reinforcing that validation-seeking, but in the sense of organizing change to resolve that dissatisfying dissonance between your habits and your morals.\n\nThis may sound clich\u00e9, but in other words, that for me has boiled down to finding what makes me happy--happy beyond the miniscule relief when fulfilling my educational obligations. In your case, that would be equivalent to finding something enjoyable beyond others' acknowledgement of your accomplishments.\n\n(When you find yourself caring too much about what other people think, it's a good idea to take a step back and focus on yourself for a bit.)\n\nThose other things that make you happy can be things that you find coincide with your current actions, external pastimes or passions, or anything in between. For example, I picked up my hobby of drawing again, since I remembered times during which I enjoyed it (external pastime). I also decided that, if I was going to spend so much time on obligated education, I might as well remember what I learned. So instead of letting myself cram things into my short-term memory only to later forget everything (like I did up until my sophomore year of high school), I decided that I'd record everything digitally, even if that meant typing notes I'd already handwritten. (As it turns out, that also helps me study in the short-term. Plus, I can share the non-assigned notes with other students as an added bonus.) That way, I felt like I could come back to what I learned anytime in the future, just in case it might be useful. And it turn, it made that obligation of education a bit more intrinsically satisfying.\n\nI kind of went on my own rant there, but the point is that you can find happiness by focusing on different things, whether that be a separate activity or an alternative perspective within your activities in question (which you could call re-framing).\n\nAnd if you're worried about being selfish in trying to achieve, just remember that these feelings are honestly natural. For one, we have literally evolved to seek social validation as a means of building community for survival. Combining that with our distorted cultural environment--that is, the hyper-competitivity around private education, socially manifested in the form of peer pressure and urban family culture--and you get kids who get way too stressed about academic achievement (e.g. the imposter syndrome you and many other college freshmen get). So it's not your fault. Plus, if you're worried about selfishness, that means you aren't narcissistic.\n\nAnd just in case you're worried that introspection as an attempted solution would make you more selfish--don't think of it as just looking at yourself; think of it as seeking personal improvement. Self-improvement by seeking personal happiness has its social benefits--if you're a happy person, you're more likely to help others (not saying you don't already), whether that be seeing the good in people (which changes how you interact with them) or producing something that benefits society as a whole. And the people who care about you want you to be happy--they might even assume that the achievements you have are making you happy, and that is no malicious assumption. In short, just as you'd rather be happy, people would rather you be happy too.\n\n(That paragraph might have been unnecessary if you never worried about introspection being selfish.)\n\nI'd say you're already making progress by identifying this internal conflict. Given that you want to resolve it, there's some malleability, some room for growth.\n\nSo I wish you the best going forward. And if you ever find yourself in a rut in the future, just remember how far you've come.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678270525.0},{"author":"MotoManHou","text":"You should learn to get over this search for external validation.

I've been doing some research on Harvard, and it seems like a better fit academically and socially.\"\n\nMatthew nodded thoughtfully. \"I get that. You have to go where you feel like you'll thrive the most.\"\n\nAlex smiled. \"Exactly. I know I have a good shot at Harvard, but I also know it's incredibly competitive. That's why I'm studying so hard for these subject tests.\"\n\n\"Well, I have no doubt that you'll do well,\" Matthew said, clapping Alex on the back. \"You're one of the smartest people I know.\"\n\nAlex blushed. \"Thanks, Matthew. That means a lot.\"\n\nThe two of them continued chatting about their college applications and their academic pursuits, both feeling grateful for the support and camaraderie of their fellow students.\n\n \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n \n\nThe sun had set, casting an orange and pink glow over the Green Hills High School football field. The air was chilly, but the energy in the stadium was electric as the Green Hills Hornets faced off against their rivals, the Pinecrest Panthers.\n\nDavid Anderson, the star quarterback of the Hornets, felt a sense of excitement and determination as he took his position on the field. He knew that this game was important, not just for the team, but for the entire school. It was homecoming, and everyone was counting on them to win.\n\nThe game was intense from the start, with both teams scoring back and forth. David's arm was on fire, as he threw touchdown pass after touchdown pass, thrilling the crowd with his skill and athleticism.\n\nBut as the clock ticked down, the Panthers managed to take the lead, and the Hornets were running out of time.\n\nWith just minutes left on the clock, David took the field, his eyes fixed on the end zone. He knew that this was their last chance to win the game, and he was determined to make it happen.\n\nThe ball was snapped, and David dropped back, scanning the field for an open receiver. Suddenly, he saw him: his favorite wide receiver, streaking towards the end zone.\n\nDavid wound up and threw the ball with all his might, watching as it soared through the air towards his teammate.\n\nThe crowd held its breath as the ball arced towards the end zone. And then, in a burst of speed and agility, the receiver caught the ball, diving into the end zone just as the clock hit zero.\n\nThe stadium erupted in cheers and screams as the Hornets won the game, the crowd rushing onto the field to congratulate the team.\n\nDavid grinned, feeling a sense of triumph and exhilaration. He knew that this was more than just a football game - it was a moment of pride for the entire school, a testament to what they could achieve when they worked together and never gave up.\n\n \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n It was a crisp autumn evening, and Green Hills High School was buzzing with excitement for the annual homecoming dance. The gym was decorated with balloons, streamers, and twinkling lights, and the DJ was playing a mix of current hits and throwback classics.\n\nEthan and Julie arrived at the dance together, dressed in their finest attire. Ethan wore a black suit with a white shirt and a blue tie, while Julie opted for a deep red dress with black heels.\n\nAs they made their way onto the dance floor, they couldn't help but notice their classmates dressed in an array of colors and styles, from tuxedos and ball gowns to funky outfits and quirky accessories.\n\nThe music was loud and energetic, and soon everyone was dancing, laughing, and having a great time. Ethan and Julie twirled around the dance floor, caught up in the energy of the evening.\n\nAs the night went on, the DJ announced the homecoming king and queen. To their surprise, both Ethan and Julie were crowned as the king and queen. They were thrilled and slightly embarrassed as they made their way to the center of the dance floor to receive their crowns.\n\nAs the night continued, Ethan and Julie danced with their friends and took silly pictures in the photo booth. They were happy to be able to celebrate this special night together and create unforgettable memories. And as the night came to a close, Ethan and Julie left the dance with smiles on their faces, feeling grateful for their school community and the memories they had created together.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nMinho had always been interested in computer science and programming. So when he heard about the United States of America Computing Olympiad (USACO), he was eager to participate.\n\nThe first round of the competition was held online, and Minho spent weeks preparing for it. He studied algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques, and practiced programming as much as possible. Finally, the day of the competition arrived.\n\nMinho was nervous as he sat down in front of his computer and read through the problems. They were challenging, but he felt confident in his abilities. He spent the next several hours working through the problems, writing and debugging code until he was satisfied with his solutions.\n\nWhen the results were announced a few days later, Minho was thrilled to discover that he had advanced to the next round of the competition. He felt proud of his hard work and determination.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Minho continued to study and practice, determined to do well in the next round. He felt a sense of camaraderie with the other students participating in the competition, knowing that they were all working towards the same goal.\n\nWhen the second round of the competition arrived, Minho felt more confident and prepared. He worked through the problems methodically, double-checking his code and making sure he didn't make any mistakes. He felt a sense of satisfaction as he completed each problem, knowing that he was one step closer to achieving his goal.\n\nWhen the results were announced a few weeks later, Minho was thrilled to learn that he had qualified for the USACO finals. He felt a sense of accomplishment and pride, knowing that his hard work had paid off.\n\nParticipating in the USACO had been a challenging and rewarding experience for Minho. He felt even more inspired to pursue computer science and programming, knowing that he had the skills and determination to succeed.\n\n \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n \n\nThe Social Justice Club at Green Hills High was an important place for students who were passionate about making a difference in their community. Priya, the club's president, had worked hard to create a space where students could come together to discuss issues of social justice, learn from each other, and take action to make a positive impact.\n\nIn the club's weekly meeting, Priya stood at the front of the classroom, leading the discussion. The topic of the day was voting rights, and the students had gathered to brainstorm ways to increase voter turnout in their community.\n\nPriya began by sharing some of the statistics on voter suppression and disenfranchisement, which led to a lively discussion among the students. They talked about the importance of voting and the ways in which voter suppression had affected their own families and communities.\n\nAs the conversation continued, the students came up with a list of ideas for increasing voter turnout. They talked about the importance of voter education, outreach to marginalized communities, and the need for more accessible polling places.\n\nPriya listened carefully to each student's ideas, offering encouragement and guidance as they worked to develop their plans. She made sure everyone had a chance to speak and contributed her own thoughts and suggestions.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, the students had created a detailed plan of action, including a voter education campaign, community outreach events, and partnerships with local organizations. They felt inspired and empowered to take action, and they knew that they had Priya's support and guidance every step of the way.\n\nAs the students gathered their belongings and headed out of the classroom, Priya stayed behind to clean up. She smiled to herself, proud of the work the club had accomplished and excited about the impact they would make in their community. She knew that the Social Justice Club at Green Hills High was making a real difference in the world, one meeting at a time.  \n \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n   \n \n\nEthan Green sat at his desk, his laptop open in front of him as he stared at the blank page of his UChicago Early Decision application. He had been working on it for weeks, pouring over every word, trying to make sure that he conveyed his passion and creativity in the best possible way.\n\nBut now, as the deadline loomed, he found himself struggling to find the right words. He had written and rewritten his personal statement, agonizing over each sentence, but it still didn't feel quite right.\n\nJust as he was about to give up, his sister Julie walked in, her guitar slung over her shoulder. \"Hey, Ethan. How's it going?\" she asked, noticing the look of frustration on his face.\n\nEthan sighed. \"I'm trying to finish my UChicago application, but I just can't seem to get it right. I've been staring at this page for hours,\" he said, gesturing to the laptop.\n\nJulie nodded sympathetically. \"I know how you feel. But don't worry, I have an idea that might help,\" she said, setting down her guitar.\n\nEthan raised an eyebrow. \"What's that?\"\n\nJulie grinned. \"Well, you know how UChicago is all about creativity and thinking outside the box, right? So why not approach your application in a more creative way?\" she said.\n\nEthan thought about it for a moment, then nodded. \"Okay, I'm listening.\"\n\nJulie pulled out a piece of paper and a pen. \"Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to ask you a bunch of random questions, and you have to answer them as creatively and imaginatively as possible. Then, we'll take your answers and turn them into your supplemental essay,\" she said, grinning.\n\nEthan chuckled. \"That's a crazy idea, but I like it. Let's do it.\"\n\nFor the next hour, Julie peppered Ethan with questions about everything from his favorite childhood memory to the weirdest dream he had ever had. Ethan answered each one with enthusiasm, letting his imagination run wild.\n\nBy the end of the session, Julie had a page full of notes, and Ethan had a renewed sense of energy and creativity. Together, they crafted his supplemental essay, using his imaginative answers to showcase his unique perspective and creative potential.\n\nAs Ethan hit the submit button on his UChicago Early Decision application, he felt a sense of excitement and pride. He knew that his essay might not be what the admissions committee was expecting, but he also knew that it represented who he truly was: a creative and imaginative thinker with a passion for writing and a desire to make a difference in the world.\n\n \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n \n\nAlex Chen sat in the cafeteria, picking at their lunch as they listened to their classmate, Mark, ramble on about his girlfriend. They tried to ignore the way he kept using the wrong pronouns for them, but eventually, they couldn't take it anymore.\n\n\"Hey, Mark,\" Alex said, trying to keep their voice calm. \"I know you're probably not doing it on purpose, but can you please use they\/them pronouns when you refer to me? I'm non-binary, so it's important to me.\"\n\nMark looked at Alex with a puzzled expression. \"Non-binary? What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"It means that I don't identify as male or female,\" Alex explained. \"I use they\/them pronouns because it's a way for people to acknowledge my identity without using gendered language.\"\n\nMark rolled his eyes. \"That's ridiculous. There are only two genders. You're either a boy or a girl.\"\n\nAlex felt a pang of anger and frustration. They knew that Mark wasn't intentionally trying to be hurtful, but his words still stung. \"Actually, there are more than two genders. And it's not up to you to decide how I identify. I'm telling you what my identity is, and I need you to respect it.\"\n\nMark shrugged. \"Fine, whatever. But it's gonna take me a while to get used to it.\"\n\nAlex sighed. They knew that dealing with ignorance and intolerance was part of being non-binary, but it still hurt. They wished that people could be more understanding and accepting of who they were.\n\nAs Alex gathered their things to leave the cafeteria, they felt a hand on their shoulder. They turned to see Priya, one of their closest friends, looking at them with concern.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" she asked.\n\nAlex shook their head. \"Not really. Dealing with this kind of stuff is exhausting.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Priya said. \"But just remember that you're valid and loved, no matter what anyone else says. And if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm always here.\"\n\nAlex smiled gratefully. It was reassuring to know that they had friends who accepted them for who they were, even when others didn't. They took a deep breath and walked out of the cafeteria, feeling a little bit stronger than before.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n\n\nPart 4 is on its way!","upvote_ratio":0.57,"created_utc":1678261712.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Would you rather","author":"Background-Ad9643","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/11ljx4n\/would_you_rather\/","text":"Would you rather go to Georgia Tech with a full ride or Stanford with 0 financial aid?

I was accepted into UVA and just received my financial aid award. Although my EFC according to FAFSA was around $20,000, according to UVA's Institutional Methodology, my EFC is around $50,000. Even with loans, my family will have to pay a little over $43,000. This is absolutely ridiculous. My family doesn't come close to affording this, especially since they also pay my brother's college tuition ($25,000).\n\nI was wondering how I should proceed from here? I already researched their appeals process and determined that I would most likely be denied. When I asked my dad, he told me not to appeal as it would not have any effect. I don't know what I should do here. UVA was my top choice, but with this cost... I don't think it would be worth it.\n\nMy dad is very supportive and told me that he'll find a way to pay for it and not to worry. He told me to just focus on my studies and he'll take care of the rest. Every single time I ask him for details on how he plans to pay this, he just gives me a vague answer and waves me off. I'm afraid he's planning on going into insane debt (or selling his soul to the devil :P) to send me to college. He's also too proud to let me go to any other college unless it's better than UVA.\n\nI've already been applying to a lot of scholarships, but I'm also not a very competitive applicant so I don't think I'll be awarded more than $5,000 max. My plan right now is probably go to Virginia Tech instead, which would cost me $30,000. Since I plan on majoring in CS, both VTech and UVA are good options. However, this is still way out of my family's affordability range, and I doubt I can convince my dad to let me go as it isn't better than UVA (by which I mean ivy level). I could also wait it out for another year for my sister to enter college, in which my EFC would likely go down.\n\nI genuinely feel stuck here. I think my EFC got inflated by the number of properties we own (and owe a lot of debt on). I can't appeal the offer because my dad refuses to. I also don't want him to go into deep debt to pay my college tuition. I just feel so stuck, and I don't know where to go from here. \n\nSome advice would be appreciated on how to proceed!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678240353.0,"comments":[{"author":"Nearby_Remote2089","text":"Have you done the NPC for UVA?

Many private schools - and top schools in particular - offer very generous aid.  MIT, for instance, offers [nearly full aid](https:\/\/sfs.mit.edu\/undergraduate-students\/the-cost-of-attendance\/making-mit-affordable\/) to undergraduates whose families make less than 65,000 a year. Meanwhile, almost all public schools are stingy about aid for out-of-state students, regardless of income level. It's a bit different if you're an international. MIT and a handful of other private schools will meet your full need and be \"need blind,\" which means the fact you're asking for aid won't be considered in your application. Many others will offer aid for internationals, although this aid is often limited and the fact you're applying for aid will negatively affect your application.

But most colleges want to at least see a couple of years of language other than English on your transcript. Some want to see more. You should check out the recommended course list for colleges you might be interested in. They usually have them on their admissions web page \n\nHere\u2019s my copy paste:\n\n\n\nWhy Take a Third or Fourth Year of Foreign Language?\n\nGood question. I\u2019ve asked that myself a lot and here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned. \n\nIt shows a willingness to learn something beyond what\u2019s comfortable. You learn a language to be forced to think beyond your native language\u2019s thought structure.\n\nLanguages flex your brain in different ways and make it work in another functional way\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard admissions officers and counselors say:\n\n- [ ] They value the commitment of students who continue to persevere with language if it\u2019s available\n\n- [ ] The study of language helps with cultural competency\n\n- [ ] Language study teaches an appreciation of other cultures and helps develop an understanding of how language affects our ability to think and express ourselves. Selective colleges want students who delve deep into another language for its inherent value.\n\n- [ ] It\u2019s not about the language. It\u2019s about the way of thinking and learning a new skill set.\n\n- [ ] It\u2019s considered a matter of \u201chorsepower,\u201d allowing you to think differently and grow your ability to empathize, understand other cultures, and stretch your mind.\n\n- [ ] Also, studying other languages allows you to really understand English and grammar because you\u2019re being forced to go through a complex analysis of how grammar and language work.\n\nKids who go to fancy prep schools are advised to take at least one language all four years, and often two. For example, my kids all took Latin all four years, and then also took Greek as seniors, and took either French or Spanish for 2 or 3 years. This is all in high school. Not including the Spanish 1 or 2 or Latin 1 or 2 they did as middle schoolers. And they aren\u2019t uncommon \u2014 especially for humanities majors.\u00a0 If you\u2019re a stem major, it matters slightly less.\n\nOf course, students are accepted without the fourth year of language bc they do look at what\u2019s offered to you and what you have taken, but I encourage all my students to stick with their fourth year of language.\u00a0 So I just share whatever advice I give my private students with y\u2019all here.\n\nHere\u2019s what Yale says though, for example: \u201cYale does not have any specific entrance requirements (for example, there is no foreign language requirement for admission to Yale). But we do look for students who have taken a balanced set of the rigorous classes available to them. Generally speaking, you should try to take courses each year in English, science, math, the social sciences, and foreign language.\u201d (https:\/\/admissions.yale.edu\/advice-selecting-high-school-courses)\n\nAnd colleges are definitely aware that different students have access to different opportunities in high schools and some schools only offer two years.

Only a small handful of schools (Harvard, Princeton) are wealthy enough where that\u2019s not an issue but they also fill a large portion of their class with full pay students too.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678221031.0}]},{"title":"additional materials","author":"eebuilder","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/11l0mdd\/additional_materials\/","text":"ok guys. i kinda just realized this but i feel like an idiot lol. i took an okay (not too sizable) amount of CC classes while in hs (around 8, including two advanced math courses) and i just realized there\u2019s no way of the schools receiving the official grades for all of those (they were all A\u2019s). do i need to upload that transcript in the additional materials section? also if not that should i upload my junior year science fair presentation? sorry if this is an obvious question, we don\u2019t really get any help at our school when it comes to this :(\n\nedit: i put the courses in my additional info section when i did the common app with the amount of credits and grade.","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1678198875.0,"comments":[{"author":"Certain-One-8755","text":"If you have the transcript I would email\/upload in the portal asap","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678199103.0},{"author":"skieurope12","text":">and i just realized there\u2019s no way of the schools receiving the official grades for all of those\n\nTranscripts should have been sent by the application deadline.

The college application process can be long and stressful for both students and parents.  Below are the things I have learned along the way that I would like to pass on to other parents going through this process.\n\n- If college costs matter, then as a parent figure out what your contribution to your child\u2019s tuition is going to be.  Ideally by the end of their junior year in high school, and stick to that number.  It is very easy to get desensitized to college costs.  Then discuss those numbers with your child.  If funding is limited, then emphasize to your child that costs matter in choosing a college.  It is very possible that your child will need to choose a cheaper lower-ranked school over a more expensive higher-ranked school, even if they are accepted by both schools.  We tell our kids that if they work hard in high school, then they can get into a good college.  So it can be a hard conversation to ask your child who just spent four years doing everything asked of them to consider choosing a lower-ranked college due to costs.\n\n- The Net Price Calculators are very accurate.  Every financial aid package that I have gotten back with my kids has been within $1000\/year of the NPC price.  Use the NPC to screen out schools.  If you are not close to being able to afford the NPC price, my recommendation is that your child should not apply to the school.  One mistake I made is having one of my kids apply to expensive schools in hopes that the schools would offer substantially more financial aid than what was in the NPC.\n\n- There will be some surprises along the way.  If your child is a high achiever, the college application process may be the first time that they are rejected from something.  Understand that even though your child has excellent grades, test scores, and extracurriculars, so do most other applicants at top schools.  Not everything is going to go 100% your child\u2019s way in the college application process.  Expect some tears along the way.  Your child\u2019s best friend may get into a school when your child does not get into that same school.  It can be rough.  Your job is a parent is to be supportive when it happens and to get them back on their feet.  It\u2019s ok if your child does not get into all of the schools that they applied to.  If your child does not get into their first choice school, that does not mean that you have failed as a parent.\n\n- The college application process can be one of the most stressful things that your child may have experienced.  It can be a roller coaster emotional journey not only for your kid, but also for you as you try to figure out where they are headed and the finances involved with their college decision.  There can be some nights where you lie awake wondering how you are going to afford all of it, especially if you have multiple college-bound children.  Try to have someone (other than your child) to talk to when you get stressed out, need to vent, or need advice.\n\n- There are multiple paths to getting to your child\u2019s goals.  Think of college as a stepping stone rather than the end goal.  If you find your child focused on their one \u201cdream school\u201d, let them know there are other options that can get them to where they want to go.  State University can work just as well as Private College.  If a bachelor\u2019s degree is not your child\u2019s final degree, then your child\u2019s bachelor\u2019s degree college is probably less important than they think it is.\n\n- Make sure your child understands what their student loan balance is going to be when they graduate, and what percent of their estimated salary will be going to student loans after graduation.  Do not accept a college offer without your child knowing this.  Similarly as a parent, if you are taking out loans, understand what your student loan balance will be after they graduate.\n\n- If a college tour does not have an academic session with your child\u2019s prospective department, email the department academic advisor prior to your visit and let them know that you will be on campus on a certain date.  Some colleges automatically have a session like this built into the college tours, and some colleges do not.  Ask if you and your child can have a meeting with the freshman advisor for that department.  I have found a discussion with the academic advisor to be very helpful on explaining what the college\/department has to offer.  For example, my youngest kid is a STEM major.  I asked if they could show my kid a few laboratory spaces while they were there, or similar things like that, so they could get a better feel of the department.  I got much more out of these meetings than what I got on the standard college tour.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678118050.0,"comments":[{"author":"TheElves2","text":"Very good!

I found that nearly all colleges would tell you what additional info was necessary to get an accurate special circumstances aid adjustment. Having the adjusted numbers in hand rather than begging for more aid in March is way less stressful. \n\nApply to at least one financial safety early. \n\nFor students with extremely low income and few assets or multiple kids in school simultaneously, private schools which meet full need might be cheapest.

They applied to schools that were a better fit for them where we think they will be happier and have better opportunities.\u201d Another dad said \u201cDon\u2019t fall in love with any one school; they will break your heart. Keep an open mind. They will be happy and do well.\u201d At my kids\u2019 school in the Silicon Valley, Julie Lycott-Haims, former Dean of Freshman Advising told a gathering of parents that she knew we all went to fancy universities but that our kids were not likely to get into these same schools, but that is ok. She said a huge percentage of these fancy school kids were beyond amazing at academics but completely incompetent at most other areas of their lives. One particularly amazing freshman had to call her mother and ask what she liked on her salad. Her point was that many prestigious schools were probably not places you would really want your kids to attend, and check what is best for your kids and separate that from what is good for your ego.

The others I did not visit.\n\n3\/ I applied to all of them -- by myself with no one's help at all. I wrote all my essays, not my parents. I took care of having my transcript and recc letters sent, and so forth. I did it all myself. Had I not done it, I would not have gotten into college -- and my parents made that clear. It was UP TO ME. That's how I grew up. I took responsibility. My parents didn't even ask me where I had applied. That was my business. \n\n4\/ I was admitted to most of them, and I chose the better one to go to. \n\nMy parents' involvement, other than the nice two-day driving trip was zero. That parents are heavily involved in the college application process seems completely absurd to me. It's another example of \"helicopter parenting\" and it's basically butting in to your child's life in a generally unhelpful way. Let them take charge of it. This is not just the first major decision they have to make, as parents repeatedly note, it's also the first time they should be entirely in charge of the entire process. \n\nI researched all the colleges I was interested in. My parents were not involved in that. I spoke to my high school's college counselor (who was no help at all). I made the choice of where to apply. And I made the decision where I'd go. My parents said they'd pay for college and would have told me to go to a state rather than a private school if that was important to them financially, but they did not do that. Parents have the right to set financial expectations -- such as you get a scholarship or you go to a less expensive college -- but that's about the only way they should be involved, and that does not required being involved in the application process once that's made clear. \n\nAll this well-meaning advice strikes me as very obvious. Yes, college is a \"stepping-stone\". Who would think otherwise? Yes, your child might get rejected. Who knew? If it's the first time they've been rejected, then I'd say you have not been good parents. That a child is emotionally crushed by not getting into a college is utterly pathetic. They never lost a game they were playing? They were never told \"no\" about anything they care about? What kind of way is that to raise a child? Had any one of the schools I applied to said \"no,\" I would have simply gone to another one. \n\nAnd no, do not go to classes at any college you visit. It's a complete waste of time. ALL college classes are the same. The only relevant distinction is how often you must take lecture classes vs. discussion classes, the latter being where you will actually learn the subject well enough to discuss it instead of just sitting passively and being talked at. But that you can ask about. \n\nYes, college applications are \"stressful.\" It's the first major decision your child will have to make blah blah blah, but if you butt into the process all the time, then they don't really learn how to do these things, do they? You do not need to monitor them. Let them grow up, please. And, please, warning people that their child might actually get rejected just seems completely pointless. I was a teacher for nearly 50 years. Both of my two children took charge of their own college application process, and my wife and I were not involved at all. I did not even know which schools they were applying to except when it accidentally got mentioned once or twice. My kids took charge and grew up to be entirely autonomous and self-confident young women, both of whom are very successful today (and very well paid) in business. Both went to excellent colleges of their choice. You might try it. Leave your kids alone to grow up, please. I'm a little tired of a world filled with cry-babies and complainers.","upvotes":-10,"created_utc":1678134121.0}]},{"title":"Best and worst topics to write about in college essays?","author":"Odd_Bolognese1486","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ApplyingToCollege\/comments\/11khx2f\/best_and_worst_topics_to_write_about_in_college\/","text":"So I\u2019m filling out my college essays for acceptance plus various scholarships, and I was just wondering what the best and worst topics were to write about? \n\nI know not to write about sports injuries and divorce and such, but I just really have no ideas.

Yes, you may like more aspects of one college over any of your other choices, but I think in this process, it's best to remove emotional attachments to any one school. \n\nPlan your strategy, based on your stats, financial situation, location, basic college desires. You want options at the end of the process. If part of your strategy is to ED to a chosen school, make sure you and your family can handle it and try not to get too emotionally involved in this one school admission's decision. Maybe make a spreadsheet when you have all your options, and it will help you to see your best value choice. \n\nTry your best to keep an open mind and a calm, even keel.

Not sure where (or whether) to attend or what my options are. Please help.\n\nHere are my stats, briefly: 35 ACT, 4.67 GPA (top-15 public school in Ohio), 7 AP exams (5s and 2 4s) with 4 more this year. Numerous, if boring, ECs: pres. of Chess Club, mem. of Latin Club, Key Club, Quiz Team; soccer and track. National Merit Finalist.\n\nResults (applying as CS major):\n\nThe Good: Ohio State - Accepted, $3,000 Merit Scholarship (rejected for full ride scholarship);   U Tennessee - Accepted, stat-guaranteed merit scholarships (\\~$18,000) ;   U Cincinnati - Accepted, $10,000 Merit Scholarships;\n\nThe Bad: UNC Chapel Hill - Rejected;   Georgia Tech - Rejected\n\nThe Not Good Enough: Virginia Tech -  Accepted, no aid + rejected from honors college;   NC State -  Accepted, no aid (so far) + rejected from honors college;   Wisconsin - Accepted, no aid\n\nI have regrets with my application process, such as which schools I applied to, what I put in my applications, how long I spent on them, etc. Mostly they stem from ignorance and a lack of good advice from those around me. Some people assured me that my stats would carry me into almost any school I applied to and I had a good chance at a full ride somewhere--which was my ultimate goal and dream in this application process. I'm left wondering what I did wrong but more importantly where I should go from here.\n\nMy personal opinion is that, without scholarships, college is outrageously expensive. While my parents have enough money saved that I could attend the schools that gave me scholarships with very little (or no) debt, I can't justify spending that money for several reasons. Between impending divorce and health issues, my parents' financial situation is uncertain at the least. I can't conscionably take that money from them. I also simply want to earn it myself without a handout. (BTW, I won't receive any financial aid because numerous circumstances made my parents finances appear much better than they are now).\n\nI have a couple thousand dollars saved myself and know that I won't struggle to find internships, co-ops, and first jobs as a computer programmer, so I can handle the debt. I'm just wondering if any of the schools that accepted me are a smart and realistic option. I can't help but feel like I could've earned a full ride at a good school like I wanted, or at least been admitted somewhere prestigious enough to justify incurring debt.\n\nAre their universities that offer full rides to 2nd year, transfer students? Merit scholarships at all? And what would the best path to this be? Attending one of these schools, putting my nose to the grindstone to work towards additional scholarships from them my sophomore year? Doing the same at a cheaper school, planning on transferring? Taking a gap year, maybe finding work experience? Fuck college altogether because anyone can learn how to code anyway?\n\nTL;DR : I thought I was going to receive better scholarships or get into better schools. What are my options for finding a full ride or larger merit scholarships to a good CS school next school year?\n\nEdit: I didn't list my actual financial awards\/offers from these schools, so here they are:\n\nOSU: $33,000 (including scholarship)\n\nUT: $34,500 (incl. scholarships)\n\nUC: $29,000 (incl. scholarships)\n\nAnd just for fun:  VA Tech: $60,000;  UW: $58,000;  NC State: Not in yet but real talk--I'm not getting shit.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1678166580.0,"comments":[{"author":"jayphoward","text":"Rather than list the amount of scholarship money you got at each school, list the net cost at each school after including those discounts.

And two were ivies that offered about $30k\/yr in needs-based aid. \n\nWhile your admissions profile may look different than mine, as regular decisions roll out, you might be lucky enough to face the same debate: do I take a scholarship from my state school, or do I take on debt for the \u201cbigger-name\u201d school?\n\nMy answer: take the fucking money and run.\n\nI (graciously, tears-in-my-eyes, doing somersaults, etc.) accepted a full-ride to a state school. Rejecting my offers from the ivies killed me\u2026 for about two seconds. Then I celebrated beginning the next chapter of my life. \n\nI didn\u2019t realize what \u201cfull cost of attendance\u201d would really feel like until I was actually living it: going to on-campus festivals, watching free sporting events, buying Starbucks everyday with my scholarship money, using my scholarship refunds to buy my laptop and school supplies. I work two jobs throughout the school year, and I am able to put my earnings into a savings account rather than funneling every spare dollar into reducing my college debt. Without worrying about money, I am able to enjoy more volunteer opportunities: participating in student clubs, volunteering in the local community, travelling for spring and winter breaks. This has allowed me to build my resume and devote more time to applying for job opportunities, attending campus events, etc.\n\nThis semester, my university bill was negative. My school owed ME money for me to receive my college education. I, by some insane miracle, profit from taking classes. I use this money towards dorm supplies, textbooks, and, admittedly, some fun purchases (thrifting with friends, buying dinner at local restaurants). And you might be able to live like a king too if you take the money and run.\n\nWhen I asked this sub years ago if I should take a full-ride over an ivy, I was told I would be ruining \u201copportunities.\u201d If I went to an ivy league school, I would have taken $100,000 in student loans and paid $1,000 a month every month for years to pay down my debt. A state school gave me the opportunity of financial freedom: an opportunity few ever get to experience.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter the name of the university; at least, it doesn\u2019t matter as much as you think. What matters is your quality of life, the fit of the university for your academic, social, and emotional needs, and (because, after all, you want to be employed someday) what your resume looks like at the end of the four years. At my own university, I have been published in multiple national magazines, earned funding to speak at research conferences, found a job experience in my desired field as a freshman, interned at top orgs in my field, and rose to the top of student orgs\u2014not because of my university\u2019s \u201cname,\u201d but because taking the money and running gave me the enormous privilege to focus on my career development, friends, and interests, not paying off debt.\n\nI understand this post comes from an enormous place of privilege. I do not intend to write this to brag (if I was hungry for external validation, I would\u2019ve taken the ivy lmao.) My parents were first gen students who paid every cent for their education themselves. \n\nI write this to help that student who is on the fence, who worries about taking the \u201cfinancially safe\u201d option instead of the \u201cprestigious option.\u201d I write to tell that student that you will be a great student no matter where you go, not because of the \u2018name,\u2019 but because of who you are.\n\nSo take the money and run. Rule your world.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678071680.0,"comments":[{"author":"Mannings4head","text":"Good advice. State schools will have plenty of opportunities, even the ones that aren't super high ranking on the US News site.\n\nAt med school my wife met people who went to LACs, state schools, ivy leagues, and everywhere in between. My wife went to a state school herself (Wisconsin) rather than the Ivy (Yale) she got into in order to put her money away for med school so she graduated with minimal debt. One of the best young doctors at her hospital got his undergrad degree from Kansas State (ranked 162) and went to med school a Duke.

My daughter was accepted at an Ivy but is attending a LAC instead because she thought it was a better fit. She is so happy with her decision. My son, who does very well academically and is a senior, is considering attending Alabama because he can go for free and save his entire college fund for the future.

In that scenario higher education is a silver bullet.\n\nMust less information is provided for middle and upper middle social mobility\u2026likely because of the cultural stigma of social climbing.\n\nWhich, IMO, explains the difference in valuation of HYPMS for different demographics.  \n\nFor families where higher socioeconomic standing historically equated to higher survivorship the value of moving from middle\/upper middle class to upper class has significant value.  Studies about economic outcome for state schools vs ivies for high achievement students being similar miss the point.

Economic success, at least to the upper middle class range, is a baseline assumption.\n\nIf having a kid become a senator, federal judge, or other elite isn\u2019t in the cards then marrying one is an acceptable outcome.

I got basically a perfect GPA in every single class. I had the mentality of \"Anything worth doing is worth doing *well*.\" 4 years of high school, I did both the IB diploma as well as quite a few AP courses with perfect scores which I studied myself in just a weekend. I ranked top 3 in our graduating class of a 800 something students.  \n\nI had so much motivation to do things. I competed at a national level for sports, I won top 5 nationally in business competitions like FBLA, spent 1.5 years running an incorporated tech startup that got me in front of the best angel investors in my country (which still doesn't mean anything compared to the US), hired people and at one point thought I could drop out to pursue it instead of college. I also did summer programs - the best ones in my country. I was president for a program leading more than a dozen high school students for a company program that's the same idea as LaunchX. I'm not just a nerd either. I was featured in online publications and also did writing jobs that paid $200\/article. Some of my college essays were about being an immigrant - coming to the country I live in now and feeling silenced for years until I could free my mind and ideas again when I overcame the language gap, after which I also did some public speaking and ran our Ted Ed club. Other essays are about women in tech. Overall, I was a keener. I'd make the most out of any opportunity that comes my way, and I also believed trying hard would yield results. \n\nWhen I was applying to colleges last year, Yale students and Penn students who were looking over my essays told me I'm definitely in the top 10% of the applicant pool or something. I believed them. I believed that my hard work and the results spoke for themselves. That is, until I got rejected by all the  Ivies I applied to, and now have to stay in my country to do university not in the states. I just didn't understand. All the hard work amounted to nothing. It's all futile. What's the point of trying then? I'm currently at the best university program for the field I'm interested in in my country, but the emphasis for admission here is mainly grades. It might sound elitist to say the following but it's true - objectively my peers haven't done anything as much as I have done and they don't really want to either. It's hard to relate or look up to my peers and I feel isolated.\n\nI fortunately\/unfortunately had the chance to visit the Bay Area and go to a Stanford and Berkeley event, which made me feel really sad. It appears to me that in California (maybe the entire US), people are bottlenecked by their willingness to put in the world, because resources to support you are so ample. I keep thinking that if I was raised there, how much further I could've gone. I've also had the chance to meet some students from top Ivy League schools, and just in my opinion I was really surprised to see that *many* of them I've talked to (keyword *many*) are fucking normal it makes me think \"How did they get in??\" There's just nothing special about them or what they've done - they're normal people like my peers. They don't even know the kinds of world class resources that exist on their campuses. They don't take advantage of what they have. If I could have their opportunities I'd do so much with it, but these kids don't even know how much they have!?! This leaves me in a disappointed state - a state of being pissed off and also hopelessness. \n\nThe effect of this experience is that it really messed with my perception of \"trying hard.\" I'm becoming a degenerate, because my fundamental beliefs about trying hard has been changed. I've been proven wrong, that years of hard work *can* just go to nothing. Maybe they were nothing to start with. What's the point of trying now? I've already failed at my goal for the past half a decade. I don't have outstanding goals I'm striving towards. Every time I start working there's just a voice at the back of my head saying \"You've tried this. You persisted. But hard work just doesn't work.\" I'm really trying to find a way to become motivated again but this experience failing at college applications just messed up my head so deeply. I feel isolated, longing to be in California or somewhere with dreamers (which I thought was Ivy Leagues), but now my mind believes that trying hard is ridiculous - a hopeful tale people lie to themselves about but really leads them to nowhere.","upvote_ratio":0.43,"created_utc":1678217514.0,"comments":[{"author":"cakeboy33","text":"Had to check twice to make sure this was not a shitpost","upvotes":111,"created_utc":1678218342.0},{"author":"Nearby_Remote2089","text":"You\u2019re already insanely successful and your accomplishments are indicative of that.

Although my profile is not nearly as impressive compared to yours, I've been fortunate enough to experience tough failure earlier in my life. When you were self-studying calculus in middle school, my only goal was to play video games all day, leading to an abysmal GPA of 2.7. I had no friends because I was exceedingly arrogant, and had no real goals to follow. Furthermore, I didn't read any books or partake in activities to boost my intellect. \n\nAt the end of that year, I also contemplated whether it was worth it to try, since I had no \"assets\". No friends, no intellect, bad grades, no activities, and no drive. Funnily enough, I was still placed into the accelerated math program even though I had a C+ in Pre-Algebra in middle school. I interpreted this opportunity as a second chance, and I didn't want to waste it away, so I worked harder and my grades and confidence improved, and worked on self-improvement as well. It was hard dealing with neglect at first, but over time it became better. Now, I always seek opportunities to gain experience, actively improve from mistakes, and help my peers. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, it's not over. You have plenty of \"assets\", in the form of experience, a drive, passion, and commitment to hard work. You can reuse those skills regardless of which college you're at, and heck, I don't even know if you NEED college if your startup prospers. Know that there's always a wide variety of options for you ahead, and setting Harvard or Stanford as your only options increases the pressure since you don't have flexibility for your path.

I\u2019m not saying that you need to work with unmotivated people (we can all agree that we don\u2019t want to live through those group projects again where only one person does work and the other people mooch off of them...) but one big part of success is learning to work with different people and BUILDING CONNECTIONS.

Say you\u2019ve recently graduated and you\u2019re trying to break into a field. Knowing people who can help bring you in and guide you through that field will be substantially more helpful than trying to navigate the professional world alone as a fresh graduate with limited experience.

Be your authentic self. Show your personality. They wanna hire someone who will be fun to work with as much as they wanna hire a studious intern.\n\n2. Show interest - ask plenty of questions, show you've really thought about this opportunity and are interested\n\n3. Be sure to speak about what you'll do as an intern. This is the stage where you have to connect your resume and qualifications with how you'll make an impact. Don't assume the committee\/hiring board will know how you will make an impact.\n\n4. Gauge who your interviewer is. This will depend on the interviewer, but if they seem a little more laid-back, feel free to joke occasionally and show you'll fit in with the workplace atmosphere. Likewise, if they seem downright staid, maybe steer clear of jokes.\n\n5. Be courteous. Ask them how their doing, feel free to engage in small talk. Ideally you wanna mix a little small talk and your questions for the interviewer in between their questions for you. This makes it seem much more like a conversation and more relaxed, and fwiw I've found that in the interviews where I do this the interviewer ends up liking me and really remembering me.\n\n6. Always answer the question. Too many people get caught up in what they're saying and fail to answer the question they were given. I've seen so many fellow interviewees set their answer up excellently, only to fail to actually answer the question.\n\n7. Ask the interviewer questions about themself and their time at the company. People love to talk about themselves. This will also help you warm the interviewer up to you, creating a more relaxed setting.\n\n\nGood luck! I'd say overall just be attentive, show interest, and be interesting and you'll be alright. People often enter interviews not realizing they're more behavioral than companies\/colleges would like to admit (this mistake is true for high schoolers and adults alike). Employers are flawed and often choose the interviewee they like the most, not the most qualified one.

If you are full pay OOS you could probably find some better value options, but if you get a scholarship or are in-state it's pretty good.  \n\nThe big advantage it has over some of its peers is the ease of getting in - direct admission can still be hard but Boulder's not competitive process to switch into engineering is less common among similarly good engineering schools.
