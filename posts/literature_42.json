I knew it was going to affect me when Charlie first starts to realise how inhumanely his \"friends\" treated him, but even though he does become a bit insufferable in the middle of the book, those last 20 pages were almost painful to read through. I've never felt so horrible for so many fictional people all at once. I really hope everyone will read it if they haven't already, it says so much without ever feeling preachy, written with a genius' narrative, and a heart wrenching story. Quickest I've ever read a book since Harry Potter 7 came out when I was 12 ",

Nearly every paragraph is littered with a surplus of metaphors (those involving the word 'darkness,' especially) that distracts from the essential plot– speaking of which, I cannot tell if this work is genuinely supposed to be reminding us of the tragedies of European imperialism in the Congo or explaining to us the disgust Conrad felt upon seeing all that *savagery* and *demoralization.*\n\n\nGiven, I am enjoying the stylistic choice of having Marlow's voice bleed together with Conrad's, but at the same time, it confuses me as to whether Conrad was racist or not, considering Marlow is constantly remarking on the Congoleses' animalistic, beast-like qualities... And yes, I do understand that this novel was published in 1899, but it's main function was an attempt to target darkness in the hearts of the imperialists, not to demonize the Congolese.\n\n\nWhat do you guys think of this book, if you have read it? I am still not fluent in critiquing literature or understanding it at such a depth, but so far I do not enjoy it. \n",

Feel like my head is spinning but it was a good read.\n\nI read that Bolaño said the book has 'orbits' around certain poles; Santa Teresa being one and another one he didn't specify. I'm thinking death, exploitation, corruption, complicity or some nexus like that.\n\nAn early crude interpretation I've formed is how the Klaus Haas character might form some kind of scapegoat, like the nazis are 'scapegoats' for a lot of the horrors of the twentieth century - obviously some of which they're responsible for but the emphasis on them obscures and camouflages everyone else's complicity in the horrors of life. Like I said, just a crude primary interpretation so no need to go nuts if you think this is wrong ;)\n\nWhat did other people think? Is savage detectives worth a read?\n\nEdit: and it makes sense that Haas isn't even a nazi, he's the nephew of someone who was a pretty reluctant Wehrmacht infantryman, but he's German, tall, blond and blue eyed so he fits a kind of crude approximation of a stereotypical nazi- something I picked up on is kind of non-identity/identity thinking critique: so the arrest and trial of Haas as the killer is like a desperate attempt to make one person into a monster responsible for all the killings while it's a blatantly a societal problem that persists after his incarceration. \n\nLike the way a concept doesn't capture what it's supposed to represent/phenomena are mutilated and reduced to fit a preformed theory",
