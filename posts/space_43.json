        "text": "When you think about it, Jupiter is the sole reason why we’re here. You may think I’m crazy just by that statement but hear me out.\n\nEarly in our solar systems formation, Jupiter played a massive role. When you look at extrasolar systems, you see that large rocky planetary bodies are common- a lot more common than Earth-sized bodies. Jupiter helped thin out this protoplanetary disk by throwing everything across the system. It is even theorized that super earth-sized planets were being formed in the inner solar system but due to planetary collisions and the thinning out of the disk, we got the planets we got today. \n\nWhen you think of that alone, Jupiter saved us. Even if a super earth formed and life emerged, if something like humans evolved, they could probably never leave that planet or would have a lot of trouble doing so. \n\nAnother thing is that Jupiter protects us from all these asteroids, preventing us from being bombarded all the time (except for that one time with the dinosaurs, I’m still not over that)",

Do I want to call every cell phone on Earth to see say I am running about 20 minutes late?\n\nI don't talk to the whole planet. There is no central authority trying to talk me every single person on Earth.\n\nIf there is any civilization out there, most of their energy will be spent talking among all the entities there. They won't spend much time trying to call us. They have too much to say to the other of their people who live just out of earshot.\n\nInstead of looking for a direct communication aimed at us when they don't yet know we are here. Instead, should be we looking to detect some large amount local communications among those entities out there?\n\nIs it better to look for a band of energy usage from an exoplanet that is higher than natural phenomena would be likely to produce?\n\nHere we have various types of noise pollution. Some is in the audio range. Perhaps we could also see noise in the radio spectrum or other ranges. Perhaps looking for that on exoplanets would be more fruitful.\n\nThe first question to address is what would be the energy profile that we might see on a planet that would indicate technology used for local communication or cultural development? The expectation would be that any useful range would be one where there is not overwhelming naturally occurring noise on that range of the spectrum. Then they would fill it with their own information chatter.\n\nIf we detect an overabundance of power in such a range of the EM spectrum. Then we would have found something!",
