I literally could not find a plain whole milk yogurt at the store today.",

If this is correct, I have a question about fats, I understand that the body consumes energy by consuming nutrients (carbohydrates/fats/proteins) but... I will give you an example, what happens to a person who has only eaten during the day? fat but below your TDEE?",

Is there a way to get supplemental trace minerals without having to ingest toxic elements? As in, supplements that either remove the lead/arsenic during production or come from synthetic sources? \n\nI am asking this in the context of prolonged fasting, so food sources are not really an option.",
