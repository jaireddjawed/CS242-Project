        "text": "Here's my thinking: a generation ago, when our parents worked in auto factories or coal mines or post offices or bookstores or whatever, there might have been a lot of jobs where most productive 5% of workers probably produced, say, 2 or 3 times the value of the average worker. You can pick strawberries three times faster than Joe Median, but probably not thirty times faster. You could imagine that the productivity distribution in jobs like these might be sort of bell-curve like.\n\nBut if you're a computer programmer, or a graphic designer, or a data scientist, or an engineer, or a biochemist, a roboticist... it's very common that the best 10% of people in your job generate ten or twenty times more value with their work than the median or mediocre employee. The productivity curve (or \"value generated by labour\") would be more Pareto-like. \n\nIt seems like these kinds of jobs are more common than they used to be. Could this be a major cause of increased income inequality?   Is there well-known research into the distribution of productivity? I am not a trained economist. I economise at night from a small back office disguised as a barber shop. i have done a basic google and google scholar search and not found all that much, but maybe I'm using the wrong keywords.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Hawaiian and Polynesian aesthetics were enormous in the 50s and early 60s, forming the backbone of the laid-back and sexy Tiki/Exotica movement. A big component of this movement was the image of the \"Hula girl\", a beautiful brown woman with bare breasts or a coconut bra. \n\nI think this image has characteristics of both sexual availability and forbiddenness, because interracial sex was a huge taboo in this society yet the American military presence in the Pacific meant sex between white men and Asian or Pacific women happened constantly. It's got really nasty colonial implications and allows no real value to these women beyond their aesthetic and coital functionality. This image is definitely dated and associated with the 50s, but it persists in the still-ubiquitous [Hula girl bobble doll](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00126MXU6/ref=asc_df_B00126MXU65344363/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=395033&amp;creativeASIN=B00126MXU6&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=191991112967&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=2200044904992779668&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9011932&amp;hvtargid=pla-303413785158).\n\nIt seems like this image came about at a hugely important time in American society, because sexual attitudes were on the immediate cusp of the 1960s revolution of permissiveness. I think the hula girl was the first time images of nearly-nude women were allowed in US media. You could even argue that the fetishization of Pacific women made it possible for white women to depicted in such a frankly sexual context.\n\nThere's no way I'm the first person to think of this.

        "text": "This is my second post in a short period of time. I promise I'll cool it until my posts leave the Hot page.\n\nI'm thinking of a few game theory scenarios. I haven't delved into game theory yet, so I might not get it right. One scenario is that there is a community setting where no one has a perception of a mutual sense of personal offense. Someone may be racist to another person, and even if the person can conceive and express a thought of personal offense, and other people might share it, there may be no cooperation with anyone else. They could go \"That's racist!\", and then the other person might visibly go \"So what?\", and that's it. Another scenario is one where there is a universal level of perception about mutual personal offense. Some rogue actor could be racist, and someone might say \"That's racist!\", and even if some third actor may not genuinely feel any particular way about the matter, they may say \"That's no good\".\n\nWe seem to live in a world where there is mixed cooperation and noncooperation in the game of personal offense. People get offended, some people support them, others don't.\n\nI'm curious about what game theory has to say about how this situation might develop, particularly since noncooperation in this game might be a dominant strategy, especially when this reality is clear. If someone offends somebody, another person takes offense, literally every other person in the community shares the offense, and the original person says \"So what?\", it's the nature of the game that nothing really happens, and life goes on. This to me seems to suggest there is a natural tendency for cooperation to erode.\n\nI'll give a real world analysis. Consumer media narratives tend to support things like equality and a salable degree of social liberalism. It seems to support a realm in life of community sensibility that might incompletely constitute an entire nation or set of nations. \"Everyone\" thinks X, Y, or Z racist event is bad. But I wonder if media reality really means anything. Donald Trump persistently offended everybody his entire campaign. It was an express media reality that Trump was going to lose. Poll respondents were part of the measure of that reality, in terms of their publicly stated opinions. Nevertheless, Trump became president. It seems to me that the level of material cooperation in the game of personal offense is not something easily determinable from media reality.\n\nWhat does game theory have to say about these issues? Is a situation of shifting cooperation in socially actionable sensibilities a possible topic? What about my observations of media? What happens when certain actions in the game are public and some are private, and cooperation is a mere reality of appearances? Is that a topic in game theory?",

        "text": "I think problems in society are systemic, and to really answer them, you have to get at the root. In my opinion, an example is the naive solution to negative body standards portrayed in consumer media: portray obese people as beautiful too. To me, the underlying problem is the use of people's bodies by media companies to sell things, which has a significant role in perpetuating beauty standards, despite lacking any real authtority or competence to do so. So a \"patch\" style solution like that doesn't do anything by my standard.\n\nNeither the set of problems nor the solutions need to be \"social justice\" oriented like I gave an example for or indeterminable by even soft science. They can be things like education funding, littering, and other types of mismanagement of quantifiable resources. The solution can be squarely in the domain of a given science, like my pet theory of automating industry to the fullest extent possible and resolving critical coordination problems, or they can be a blend of different sciences.\n\nI mainly would just like to hear ideas about where social sciences have taken their research and developed fundamental solutions to problems that plague the world in a way that goes beyond simply spot checking manifestations of systemic issues and gets to the systemic issues, pausing before the ideas are not particularly sane or worthwhile. My goal is to become literate in the current standing of theorizing problems of the world and the solutions.\n\n---\n\nCopyediting what I just wrote, I realize it might appear a little bit of a tall order, and apparently reduces to \"How do we fix the world?\" I don't think it really is a tall order though, because any theory would likely be in abstract of the problem of implementing itself. I believe such comprehensive solutions as I'm asking for are not difficult to imagine in the abstract, because the real difficulty is the exponentiation when you add questions like \"How do you turn this into policy?\" and \"How do you get politicians to do it?\" and \"How do you turn this idea from a circlejerk of scientists into a popular conception?\", the latter of which involves solving education problems a given solution is partly meant to solve itself.\n\nSo I hope you see I'm not asking anyone to give me solutions to this recursive exponentiation of difficult problems. I just want to know what kind of brainstorm ideas different scientists have had about the base problems.\n\nETA: I still think this question falsely appears ridiculous, so I just want to throw out there that Marxist communism started out as an idea by German social scientists, and it was one of the most consequential political theories arguably ever. I'd like to know where we've gone since then.",

Below is the description of the ideas and I’d love it if someone could put a name or researcher to them so I can learn more. Thanks!\n\n***\n\nONE IN THE CHAMBER?\n\n\nWhen A says something that offends B, the next idea that A presents that B knows nothing about will be rejected by B; B experiences loss due to the initial offense and desires to recoup that loss with rejection of A’s next idea.\n\nWhen A says something that offends B, the next idea that A presents that B knows about will be rejected by B not on the basis of the offense but rather on the basis of B's prior knowledge; the desire to regain the initial loss persists until the next known idea is presented.\n\nMore offensive ideas create a series of \"one in the chamber\" which ranges from rejection of one idea to infinite ideas.\n\nWhen A says nothing that offends B, the next idea that A presents that B knows nothing about will be taken with an open mind and met with questions rather than immediate rejection.\n\ne.g. A says something that highly offends B, all subsequent ideas (both known and unknown by B) will be rejected; often seen as a series of, \"no, no, no, shut up, you're wrong, wrong again, shut up\" responses. I think I’ve heard it called character/political suicide since one idea acts as the basis for dismissal of all following ideas.\n\n***\n\nEMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION\n\nPeople have a finite daily quantity of available emotions that much like a car fuel tank depletes over time. The emotional tank size varies from person to person when controlling for age, gender, and other demographics.\n\nThe items used to refuel the tank, such as petting a cat or playing games, varies in effectiveness from person to person.\n\nRefill items and depletion items (e.g. waking up to displeasing text messages) are more impactful during the start of one's day and decrease in effectiveness as time goes on. Looking for research stating the start of the emotional day is very impactful on the perception of the day.\n\nThe amount of sleep affects item effectiveness. More sleep makes an item more effective.\n\nHowever, to what degree does sharing feelings take up the effort to act?\n\nAre feelings and action separate economies in the human mind? Or do they share the same space? i.e. one can feel exhausted emotionally to the point of inaction.\n\n***\n\nIf it helps, I was reading books on behavioral economics and negotiation when I thought of these but didn't see any examples of them in the book or definitions. :(\n",

All I'm asking is this:\n\nIn what terms do social scientists commonly discuss, if they do, interactions in which no participant seems to really exert much influence on the others? Or is it simply that such situations are just not labeled as interaction at all?\n\nWhat examples am I thinking of here? The familiar situation of seeing someone you know 500 feet away and not knowing when you should acknowledge them or say hello.

This is a fairly elementary observation. However I'd like to get a theoretical perspective on this from the field of sociology, which I imagine has dealt a lot with how ideology embedded in vocabulary shapes the experience and observations of sociologists and how they describe what they see. I would in particular like references to sociology of crime, law, race, perhaps health.

I would never bark orders at a potential customer like that face-to-face, yet terse commands seem to be the norm in advertisements. I often here things like \"call today\" or \"take advantage or our low interest financing\" from large companies. It's rare to hear something like \"please consider shopping with us,\" or \"next time you need tires, we'd appreciate your business,\" though that's what I'd expect from a sales rep if we met in person. Even something like \"Enjoy Coke\" is actually a pretty rude way to put it compared to \"Please enjoy a Coke.\" \n\nI'm sure that the advertising industry as a whole has researched the matter and found that this rather curt, authoritative messaging works better, but I wonder if there are any ideas as to why.

I was unable to find direct corroborating evidence, although I did find some [news articles](https://global.handelsblatt.com/finance/a-surprise-tax-giveaway-212757) referring to the government wanting to index tax rates to end bracket creep or \"cold progression\" as it looks to be called in Germany. I also couldn't find references to this issue in the English translation of the [constitution](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html).\n\nThe context of the paper is whether and under what conditions inflation-indexing is beneficial:\n&gt;If the tax indexing serves only to reduce but not to eliminate the adverse effects of inflation but leads to policies that produce a higher rate of inflation, the net effect of indexing on economic welfare may be negative\n\nFor additional context rather than taxation I'm actually more interested in the issue indexing loans (e.g. mortgages) to inflation, which was a big thing in Iceland prior to the crisis.",

They might ask, 'what relevance does \"she\" have in describing \"that person over there\" when we have so many other characteristics to choose from?'\n\nMy point in this question isn't to debate the merits of any of this, but rather just to ask why the trend seems to have gone way rather than the other.  Are there established /medical policy groups that have made the recommendations? Are the changes just in response to requests from student groups who have agitated for the changes? Etc. \n\nThanks!",

They mention names Lipset and Bell that reminds me of my long forgotten days as polisci undergrad. Here's the most important paragraphs:\n\n&gt; What — and, most importantly, who — did this original Populist movement stand for? Its progenitors, including agrarian cooperatives, trade unions, and Granger clubs, can be traced back to at least 1877. Drawing on the Greenback and Jeffersonian strands in American political thought, they revolted against low grain prices and currency scarcity, while also defending the cause of industrial workers.\n\n&gt; Where [then] does [pejorative vision of populism] originate? ... by far the most plausible traces this negativity to the rather partial readings of the original Populist movement offered by American historians of the 1950s — and one major historian in particular: Richard Hofstadter.\n\n&gt; In the 1960s, modernization theorists like Seymour Martin Lipset, Daniel Bell, and Edward Shils (often colleagues of Hofstadter) integrated the term into their own models of a new social science. There, the word populism, used as a synonym for “illiberal democracy,” fared rather well. Political scientists globalized the concept to fit patterns of modernization in regions such as Latin America, East Asia, and Africa. In these instances, they described democratic movements as populist if they didn’t conform to the rules of the liberal game — populism as “democracy without the rule of law.”\n\n\"Populism\" has been used to describe \"left\" and \"right\". What's the use of the term then? What does it even mean? Looking for insight from sociologists and political scientists/IR scholars.",

        "text": "Edit: When people have asked whether The Nazis were right wing or not, I've seen people answer that they are placed on the right side of the spectrum because the Nazis were a nationalist movement. I'm trying to clarify why been nationalist makes a movement right wing. Is it because of the kind of nationalism that the Nazis practised? \n\nLeft wing nationalism is also given it's own category, and it seems to be the right that engages in nationalism. For example american conservatives embrace American exceptionalism, and are the big proponents and defenders of American foreign policy, such as during the Iraq and Vietnam wars. Finally, I think Jonathan haidt had loyalty as one of the five values that the right holds, and that includes loyalty to a nation. It's been a while since I've read his book though, so i'm not sure if I've got that right. ",
