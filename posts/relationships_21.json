        "text": "I have been living with my boyfriend for 7 months now. Before we moved in together, we were long distance for about 5 months. I moved to be with him because I was in love with him and ready to live somewhere new anyways.\n\nFor context, I moved from Canada to the UK which is a 7 hour time difference and 12 hour flight.\n\nFor the past couple of months, I have been finding it really hard to adjust to my new life. I miss my friends and family a LOT. I feel like I’m living my partner’s life and struggling to find my own identity here. I have started therapy and have some plans for how to make my own life here.\n\nHowever, the whole problem of me feeling unsure of who I am here takes a toll on our relationship. One small argument triggers me to feel insanely isolated and lonely, causing me 1-2 days of crying, arguments, and then me realizing I have overreacted and I feel crazy. I have had 2 panic attacks triggered by small arguments.\n\nA couple of days ago, we had another small argument. It really was just over both of us snapping at the other, which should have been resolved quickly. I couldn’t let it go, continued arguing, and had essentially a mental breakdown. I told him I wanted to move out and started packing my things. Took me a whole day to realize I was being insane.\n\nI broke my partner’s heart when I started packing my things. He had to beg me to stay. He understands now all the factors that lead me to spiral, and I have an appointment scheduled with my doctor as I think I may have depression. But I feel like this is not fair to him and I don’t know how we can move forward. He still wants to be with me but I really crushed him. He’s scared that I will leave at the next small argument, and I’m scared I will threaten to as well. I feel like I am not in control of my own brain once I am triggered. Has anyone gone through something similar?\n\nTL;DR I had a mental breakdown over something small and told my boyfriend I wanted to leave him, which broke his heart. I calmed down and realized I didn't want to, but I don't know how we move forward because he doesn't know if I will do this again.",

        "text": "I (23F) met my boyfriend Mike (24M) in my first year of university. We've been together for almost 4 years now, and there's been talks about moving in together.\n\nNow, I fostered a feral cat that ended up infesting my house with fleas. I spent weeks throwing out furniture, cleaning constantly, applying all kinds of pesticides, getting chemical burns and flea bites, going to vets. It was extremely exhausting, and I communicated my frustration to him.\n\nAt some point, I hired some workers off the internet to dismantle a heavy bed I had. Mike asked me to be careful, as I'd be alone at home with several strange men. I hadn't thought of it that way, but when he mentioned it, it made sense. I then asked him to come to my apartment so I wouldn't be alone and also to help me remove some other heavy furniture as well.\n\nHe seemed very reluctant about it and said he'd think about it and let me know (9/10 times, that is his way of saying no). I was taken aback by his response, as it's the second time in those years I've asked him to help me out and the first time he also refused. He said that he didn't think it'd be worth the hassle just to be there for me for a couple of hours. Granted, he lives ~1 hour away by bus (each way), but he also didn't have anything else to do that day.\n\nWhen I brought up how I was hurt by this, he dismissed it and said he didn't think it was a big deal. On the other hand, I go to his house regularly (20-30 minutes by car each way), and I've helped him several times by driving him to job interviews, picking him up, running errands. I had also readily promised to help him with moving houses next month (before this happened).\n\nThroughout our relationship, he regularly seems to put his needs and comfort above mine, no matter what. He refuses to be even minorly inconvenienced. It often makes me wonder what kind of husband or father he would make, as all the men in my family are the types of guys who would sacrifice themselves for their family. I've always thought that you should love your partner and family above yourself, and that sometimes you have to take a bullet so your loved ones don't. I am always there for whatever he asks of me.\n\nIs my view of relationships outdated? Am I overreacting and being too emotional about this? Would you consider a 2 hour total commute too much to help your drained SO out?\n\nTL;DR Battled flea infestation, asked BF for help, he refused because he didn't feel like I was worth taking the bus for.",

        "text": "for context me(19M) and this girl (19F) decided that we should not talk to each for a while and just catch up soon. The reason being is because this past 2 weeks she’s been really really busy with school and super exhausted and frustrated with it to the point where she’d rather scroll on tiktok, post stories on insta, share posts on facebook, or talk to her best friends than talk to me because well, she’s tired after a very long day (she gets home around 7-8pm and will do her assignments and all that) ever since she started to get real busy with everything at school she’s become different towards me, like she’ll only reply to me, not talk to me, send one word texts (sometimes), inconsistent updates, or seemingly uninterested in text, hot and cold, but she’s never dry or cold when it comes to texting her friends. Basically she’s not the lovergirl anymore like she used to be when we first started. i confronted her in a calm way that i wanted her to update me when she’s busy rather than leaving me on delivered for 1 or 2 hours and noticed that she’s been acting different when it comes to me. She got mad or irritated at me so it turned to a big arguement. several hours later after the big arguement she sent me a long message that she’s sorry for being toxic and acting different lately its because she’s just really tired and frustrated with everything and told me we’ll just talk soon. It’s been 6 days of no contact I need help on what to do, i really miss her and leaving her or moving on is not my plan rn idk if i should reach out now or wait for her to be finished with everything at school and maybe just reach out there? im really new to relationships, this is my first love and i dont want to start over on another girl, i want this first love to last.\n\ntl;dr me (19M) and my girl (19F) have not been talking for 6 days and im thinking of reaching out to her when she’s the one who decided to not talk for awhile",

        "text": "Here’s the breakdown. My gf is a beautiful woman, great body, great personality, she can make anyone laugh. She’s had an easier time having guy friends than girl friends in her life. \n\nShe has had 3 jobs in around 8 months, two of which she currently works. \n\nThe first job, a childhood male friend worked there and they became close again. They didn’t really talk at all anymore until she started to work there, that’s fine.\n\nSecond job she currently works at, she met a new guy there and proceeded to make an immediate friendship. This friendship has turned into staying after work an extra 2 hours some days to talk one on one. He has invited her to a party and she has invited him to the mall with her. This friendship has made things rockier. They go into detail about their lives, even going into past relationships and how he has dated black girls in the past.\n\nThe third job she’s currently working, immediately became friends with the few guys that work there. She started this job maybe 4 months ago, already talks of a group vacation 4 girls and 2 guys going. \n\nIt’s just weird to me because I don’t have any interest in making girl friends and if I did, I would respect her and not hang out with them alone.\n\nI can’t get my point across because I get called insecure. She’s already told me about one guy at her work that asked if she had a bf a few weeks into the job. She’s told me herself, “guys only think with their penis’s” and that’s why if I got a girl friend it would be different. \n\nI don’t think this is fair, but I also want to see if maybe i’m just being crazy.\n\nTLDR: Gf has a few guy friends from work, one of which she stays after work for hours to chat one on one. Is it possible for women to have platonic male friendships? Just need some advice on the topic because it’s led me down a dark hole.",

My  gf told me later that this dude pestered her for sex, which she didn't  agree to( texts messages showed the guy asking her to come to the bed,  asking if he should open the door etc). My  gf later told me they guy  treated her very badly. They had a major dispute prior to the guy  leaving due to this. My gf wanted me to come visit her whilst he was  there, but there was no way for me to. She and I always try to meet on  weekends. I also intended to let her make her own decision and not seem  dominant.\n\n2nd\n\nNow,  he is back in his country. She wished him a happy birthday on his  birthday, because she claimed she didn't want to severe their  friendship. Now, this guy has come back to send messages, stating he  misses her, and he wishes he didn't go too far. He also stated that he  did all those because he wanted a relationship. I have asked my gf why  the guy doesn't respect \"our\" relationship. My gf claimed she wants to  cut him off, but I do not want to be an asshole. I have asked her to  handle it whichever way she can. My gf wants to cut off contact with  him, should I support her in this regard? I mean, this is someone she'  known way longer than me. Their families are also friends.\n\nTl/dr: A guy pestered to sleep with my gf, she declined. Now, the guy is back asking for a relationship.",

Previous breakups also went awfully, resulting in me cutting off or being cut off completely\n\nin my previous post a few months ago i talked about my friend. well, we did start dating for 3ish months. it was the best i have ever been treated by a partner, he is so understanding and kind, one of the most genuine people i have ever met.\n\nbut he is going thru a lot, and a lot more life stuff happened. last week he brought up that he has too much going on and can't handle a relationship right now. it didnt help we were a LDR. i understood; i noticed things were getting harder for him and i knew i was going to get busier so i was concerned about how things would go .\n\nhe made sure to emphasize that it was nothing bad or anything that was my fault, or that he didnt love me anymore either, but it's just. hard bc life stuff + long distance. i believe him, i know he is telling the truth and not sugar coating it.\n\neven though i had considered the possible direction of us breaking up because of circumstances, i didn't realize just how much he and what we had meant to me until this all happened. the day after, i was crying on and off thru out my day. i got a headache and almost threw up with how hard and much i was crying.\n\ni dont know what to do. we are still friends and i know he doesnt hate me or want space from me or anything, we have had a few conversations since then and we both still care for and love each other... there's no change in feelings on that end. but it still... hurts. a lot. we are more than friends but less than a couple.\n\ni feel so lost and so alone, none of my friends have gone through this. i dont know where or who to turn to. i dont know what to do. i am scared. i still love him a lot and know he loves me. i know this is for the best, and at the same time, i dont want closure, i dont want to be just friends, but thats not my decision to make, and i know this really is the best right now. i am scared. i dont want to stop talking or being friends\n\ni am seeking my therapist tomorrow but really need some help and insight especially because none of my friends have gone through this and i feel so alone and lost\n\nthank you for reading",

        "text": "\nTldr; struggling with performance anxiety frequently enough that I am worried it may be hurting my otherwise amazing relationship. \n\nFor background, I’ve only been with a handful of partners sexually, and I’ve noticed the trend that my first time with someone I do tend to suffer from performance anxiety which inhibits my ability to maintain an erection. After being with the person and trying again the issue goes away. \n\nSo the current situation is I started dating this girl 6 months ago, and lo and behold I struggled as usual on the first try. She took it well, but I was pretty bummed with myself and decided to try Viagra. I realize that it doesn’t help to cure psychological based ED, but I figured it would give me some additional confidence, which it absolutely did for the next few months. \n\nAbout 2 months ago she had a scare that she may have been exposed to HIV (works in medical, had an accident with surgical tools) and it was quite a stressful time during which we abstained from PIV. Even though we always wear protection and were careful, and I felt given the details of her incident it was extremely unlikely we played it safe. We still had amazing sexual experiences that did not involve penetration during this time. \n\nRecently she got multiple results back saying she had a clean bill of health and we decided we would start having sex again. \n\nUnfortunately it seems even though she is not a “new” partner having this break from sex has reset my mental anxiety. I had trouble getting started, which was pretty awkward however we did eventually get it to work. The next week we tried again and just full on failed, which made me quite upset. A third time and again I get all ready to go and I step up to the plate and I lose it. We eventually got it going but it seemed like a lot of work. I should also say the Viagra doesn’t seem to be giving me that confidence boost either anymore. \n\nWe spoke about it and she’s worried that it’s something shes doing or her appearance and that I’m not attracted. But I am trying to explain to her that isn’t the case, it is 100% my issue. Things were awesome until I put the pressure on myself to give amazing sex after having the break, and it just set off this cycle apparently. \n\nIm struggling with how I am going to get past this. I think what bothers me is that I know it’s an issue with new partners, but 6 months in of mostly awesome sex (albeit with the 1 month break) I am having trouble accepting that its like square one in a way. Why am I allowing myself to feel this way with someone I was so comfortable with. And now that the cycle has started how are we going to move past it? She’s worried that I am associating sex with her with negative emotions which is a form of unattraction which makes her afraid. \n\nOn one hand I’m thinking maybe taking a break from intercourse and just doing other things instead may take the pressure off so I can relax and be in the moment to sort of rewire my anxiety, but I’m also worried this is just building up the situation to be something even more stressful when we eventually try again. \n\nThe other hand I’m thinking maybe we should just keep trying so we can get past it sooner. But that does nothing to reduce the pressure as each time we try and fail the “stakes” seem higher the next time with more upset afterwards. \n\nGetting past this feels like a hurdle that is relatively low to hop over, but it feels like its just a bit too far out of reach at the moment. Very frustrating. I love her very much and it terrifies me to no end to see such a beautiful relationship be damaged by something like this. She seems a little more distant after the event. \n\nAnyone else been here, or just in general can provide some advice?",

Admittedly, it's a bit annoying, but I didn't care like he did, and besides, at lease they clean them right?? My BF wrote a fairly friendly message into our groupchat about it. Our roommate came home shortly after and was in a bad mood. He asked my BF what his problem is, why is he always complaining and pointed out my BF didn't sweep or empty the rack last night, when Sunday is his cleaning day (we have a rota). My BF got very angry and they were yelling and he started at him in a terrifying way. I said nothing, frankly both of them were wrong and I'm a conflict averse person, it's a weakness of mine. I like keeping the peace. \n\nMy BF said my saying nothing was hurtful, a betrayal, that I didn't care that someone was \"yelling at my partner\". He called me a spineless moron, a AH, a hypocrite. He adjusted the shower so it was out of my reach (I'm 5ft, he's 6ft), so I had to get out roommate to fix it for me. I went out for a while and when I came home, he said he wished he'd never met me, wished I'd moved out, called me the c word, p word and remarked he missed his ex. He started shaking and crying and said he wished someone had stood up for him as a kid (his dad was very bad, his mom did little to protect him). I comforted him and we made up. Then the next morning he changed his mind when he heard me laughing with the roommate. He sent me loads of texts about his hurt, my selfishness. He got sick with anger. I took care of him and cried, said I don't ever want to be spoken to like he spoke to me yesterday. Then the next day he ignored me all day. \n\nThe day after he was good with me again. He and the roommate made up, but my roommate admitted he had a fork in his pocket in case my BF got, well, you know. My BF was deeply hurt and wanted me to call the roommate out (again).  He lost it Friday morning when he overheard me making plans for next weekend with the roommate and asked why I hadn't fought with him yet if I really cared. The roommate is timid like me and yes, he shouldn't have had the fork, but i get it. I told him I was going to break up with him if he didn't stop fighting over nothing. Usually my BF is the cold one, but Im starting to not want him around. What should I do?\n\nTLDR: my BF is melodramatic and blows conflict out of proportion. What should I do?",

        "text": "We've been together about 3 months and have grown quite close in that time, this is the first time there's been a problem.\n\nHe was stood next to me and I did a motion like a punching motion, with my fist moving towards his stomach, and I also made a noise like the sound of the impact. It probably does sound quite weird but I was just kind of goofing around, I didn't actually make any contact with him. Then I started laughing but he did not find it funny and said that it was a bit weird. I then felt really bad and uncomfortable but I didn't say anything. He also mentioned it two more times that evening. As an example, he was sat on the floor and I stopped to stroke his hair and kiss his head as I was going past. He responded 'that was nice, not like what you did before' (talking about the fake punch thing).\n\nWe went out that night and had an amazing night together and when we went home we carried on drinking and talking. Quite late in the night, he brought it up again. He said it was violent and that he 'saw it in me' (meaning violence). He also said that in that moment, I had seen him as a target. He was drunk and stoned when he said this. I was extremely upset about this and immediately felt like I had to get out of there. I said I wouldn't be accused of that and went and started putting my shoes and socks on. He followed me and basically put his arms round me and wouldn't let me go, wouldn't let me put my shoes on, and was essentially begging me not to go almost in tears. He said he was sorry, that he didn't know I would have such a strong reaction to what he said, that of course he doesn't see me as violent, etc. He was so upset and almost panicking that I was going to leave and I was quite shocked by it so I stayed. We then carried on talking for a while until we went to bed and everything was fine.\n\nThe next day we had a nice afternoon together and he took me home in the evening. We parted on a nice note and the incident hasn't been mentioned again. The trouble is, I can't seem to get it out of my head. What he said has really affected me and I just don't know if I even feel the same now. I grew up in a home where physical violence was the norm, I was eventually placed into foster care because of it. My boyfriend knows this. I have never punched anyone in my life and I am completely against physical violence in any form. I regret telling him about my childhood now because I feel like he's used it against me.\n\nThis isn't even the first time that something like this has happened. A while ago, while he was driving, I flicked him on his leg (there was no force behind it, he barely would have felt it through his jeans). He then started calling me violent, and it was almost like it was a joke but to be honest it wasn't that clear whether it was a joke or not and it made me feel really uncomfortable.\n\nI can't quite decide if what I did was weird enough to justify his comments or not. I thought I was just joking around but he seems to have taken it as a sign of something more sinister. I don't want to end things but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to get past what he said, I'm really upset about it. But everything else with him has been so perfect so I'm not sure what to do.\n\nTLDR; I fake punched my boyfriend of 3 months as a joke but he did not react well and accused me of being violent, I love him but am very hurt by his comments",

She’s my first girlfriend and first sexual partner I’ve ever had.  I never really put forth much effort into dating because of poor self-esteem.  But I consider myself a much improved person. \n\nHowever, we’ve recently hit sort of a rough patch. One of her friends is getting married in November and has invited us. I don’t really care for weddings so I wasn’t too excited to begin with. Then I learned that two of my girlfriend’s old hookups will be there.  Now I’m really sold on the idea of not going.\n\nHere’s where I may be the asshole, I understand that this is a big occasion but I don’t want to be in the same room as two guys she used to fuck.\n\nI’ve tried my best to explain to my girlfriend that being in the same room as two guys she used to casually hook up with and have meaningless sex with is not an ideal situation for me to be in.  However, she has stated that I am overreacting, being irrational and making a bigger deal of this than it really is.  \n\nI’ve told her that she can’t really see my side of things and where I’m coming from because she can’t see things for my perspective.  I told her to imagine if I was the only guy she had ever been intimate with and she had to be in the same room with women I used to hook up with.  She claims she wouldn’t care. I don’t really believe her.\n\nWe haven’t really gotten along since. The wedding is set for November and my decision is final, as I have decided isn’t best for me not to go to avoid any awkward situations.\n\nTL;DR - I’ve started to lose feelings for my girlfriend after realizing how inconsiderate she is of my feelings.",

About last year in August, we met up and got really drunk. He tried to make advances but I wasn't drunk enough to let him (though certain things did happen). I let him know that I was really upset, wrote long-ass messages telling him how bad I felt, and we stopped talking for a few months, until last month.\n\nI made the first move, messaged him and asked him how he's doing in the UK. He seems to be doing well, and seems elated that I contacted him again. He then asked me back.\n\n**Me**: \"Oh, nothing much, I'm tutoring now and then.**Him**: \"Oh, I used to think that I'd be fine *just* living the tutoring life.\"I already got a bit offended with the \"just.\"**Me:** \"Yeah, I know, I'm currently 'just' a tutor, hahahaha.\"**Him:** \"Ohh noo I don't mean anything by that. Please don't take it personally.  **I know you are trying very hard.** Don't let the current situation and environment bring you down!\"\n\nI dunno, I'm just very allergic to the \"I know you are trying very hard.\" And I'm not sure if I'm overreacting.\n\n1. I feel that it's patronizing. Extremely so, given the overall context .\n2. I never said being a tutor is a bad thing--this is all in accordance to my plans. But then he jumped in and assumed that it's not a good job--not a good life, for that matter\n3. And the \"I know you're trying very hard\" just indicates that he thinks I'm not living as well as I can? That my current situation is awful? I didn't even complain to him...\n\nI feel that the gap in our communication, which is when he just started his Oxbridge PhD, has a lot to do with it. He's in a new stage in his life and perhaps justifiably proud of himself. And suddenly we reconnected and I am relative lagging while he's advancing (at least from a third person's point of view). But still, it just struck me as extremely condescending, especially when I didn't even mention how I feel about my current state. Though, to be fair, he probably knows me well enough to assume that this isn't the best thing I want for myself.\n\nStill, I am upset and come back to this remark over and over again when I feel that I'm underachieving. Am I overreacting to this one line? Should I tell him how I feel? We've already chatted much more after that and he probably already forgot about this.  \n\n\nTL;DR: A good friend (30M) said \"I know you're trying very hard\" and I (30F) feel that it's patronizing. Should I tell him how I feel?",

        "text": "My (28F) partner (28M) have only been together a few months. He told me recently that a couple months before we met he was casually sleeping with a friend of his. She wanted to start dating, he didn’t, so they decided it would be best to stop the physical stuff and remain friends. I’ve since met her and she seems nice enough. I had explained this situation makes me uncomfortable but ultimately I understand it was before we were involved and although I haven’t slept with any of my current friends, I had previously slept with a friend and we went back to normal after with no danger or threat to new relationships. So I know this is possible. \n\nLast year their group went on holiday together abroad and were thinking of doing the same this year. She will be going. I’m not sure if I’m invited yet, but the idea is making my stomach churn either way. If I’m not invited I would definitely want to know why as the group consists of couples so it wouldn’t be out of place for me to be there. If I am invited how do I deal with the difficult emotions it brings up? How do I participate in the fun if I’m feeling uncomfortable? I can’t help wondering if they were sleeping together whilst they were on this holiday last year. Will they be thinking about it?\n\nSome backstory: I was cheated on in my last relationship and only found out months later because he had to come clean as I was due to discover it another way. But otherwise I wouldn’t have guessed, it was a complete shock. I’m scared I won’t be able to read the signs if it happens again. \n\nTL;DR\nBF might be going on holiday with someone he recently slept with. Is it okay I feel weird about it?",

        "text": "To me my girlfriend (F20) and I (M26) are going through an odd time in the relationship. In the last 2 weeks we haven’t talked to each other or seen each other like we used to. Which of course she gives me the explanation she was living with her friend for 1 week then went to the hospital. And to a degree I understand that. Even with situations though we don’t really talk about how we will see each other. I’ve got her to come see me today hopefully that works out. To me it feels like something is up. Our overall lack of communication just doesn’t sit well for me. Once I start to bring it up she questions if everything is alright between us and I’ll almost laugh. Although in my mind I think she notices an emotional change in myself. I’m trying to mentally brace for the potential end of our relationship. Communication has been reduced and time seeing each other has been reduced. And of course I have things about our relationship that bothers me that has been hard to say. Because we haven’t really connected enough for me to feel ok during times like this. I have my own issues with our relationship dynamics that make situations like this seem more dire. Sometimes I felt like we are so different yet sometimes really alike it’s been strange. I’ve always been so against the idea of separating love and sex. When we first had sex she was the first one to say I love you and it really made me feel like we were so alike. Because I was always like that too before I started forcing those feelings away in the beginning of a new relationship. But with time a part like this I worry just how not alike we really are. In the beginning she went on about a high sexual partner count which never really looks good. I don’t want to be with someone who values sex over love. And with time apart like this and knowing that much it only makes the mind wonder.\n\nTL:DR after time a part physically and in communication with my girlfriend. I struggle to find the right words to hit home.",

        "text": " \n\nMe and my girlfriend are 6 years together, however every 8 months a guy comes and make me think again about the relationship.\n\nLong story here, be prepared.\n\nYesterday, my gf went out to shop some stuff and get her nails done,What I'm going to say it how she told me things happened, I believe this is exactly what happened, she won't lie here.while waiting for the bus, a guy about our age approached her and told her how good she looks and started complimenting her, asking for her number. She said that she has a bf but thanked him for the compliments and went on the bus. there, he sat in a different sit but couldn't take his eyes of her and checked her out from top to bottom (from her words).anyway, on the way back, the same guy finished his gym session (as this was where he was heading), and they met again on the bus station back. He again approached her (she didn't try to talk with him even though she saw him first), started complimenting her again, she told him that she respects he has the courage to approach and again she mentioned having a bf.anyway the went up on the same bus.He sat first so he invited her to sit next to him, so she did.she said she felt awkward so she talked with the guy, he tried touching her multiple times on the hand (not something weird), and he told her again how beautiful she looks multiple times, asked how long she is with me, and then, asked for her IG.She gave her IG and followed him back.I have to add, as she told me, during her talking with him, she mentioned me multiple times.When she got home she told me everything right away.He then sent her a message on IG (where she also has some pictures with me), that a costume she were to some party and posted a picture of, was super hot and He wished he could get back home to her in that costume. She really like the compliments but she saw I was getting mad, so she started saying my bf thinks the same. etc. in the end, she said something like, my bf sends hi. and he stopped replying after that.\n\nTo me, the guy felt really \"simpy\" and complimented her so much and way too much where I felt weird, I have no problem with guys approaching her, and complimenting her (she looks amazing), but continue trying to get her after she said multiple times she has a bf? that disrespect for me and her. Maybe she sent mixed signals as she can be flirtatious and he acted based on body language and not what she says.\n\nShe did say the guy was really good looking and she felt amazing from the compliments, she didn't really want to send the messages later on IG as they were \"mean\", until I told her how it made me feel.\n\nThe problem I have with this situation, aside from her giving her IG as she told me it was weird not to give it as they were talking fine, was that this happens about every 8 months.A guy comes, tries to get her number\\\\ flirt with her, and she super enjoys it and sometimes even develops a crush, but then I have to come and explain to her why it hurts me and why it's not ok to make this continue. She thinks it is related to her dad not being with her as a child or with low self esteem that every nice guy that compliments her and she starts to \"freak out\" in her mind.But all this thing hurts me. We talk about this stuff a lot. we are the first of each other (intimate, not relationship), so I understand also feeling the lack of \"experience with different people\", but it still does hurt. What hurts more are her actions, if she just told him \"stop trying I have a bf that is enough\" I don't think I would be mad at all. but her being nice even though he continued is what hurts me. Plus they are still following each other, and from past experience with her and guys, she will post a story on IG and they will respond and a communication between them happens again, only when I tell her it's enough, she stops.But I hate it she can't do it herself and I have to step in and tell her what to do, I don't want to control or do anything, I just want her to understand my feelings, but explaining to her doesn't help.What should I do with this situation? set more boundaries? I feel like I only make her feel bad because of it. I don't want her to feel in a cage. but at the same time, I just can't get hurt and not trust her every time a guy approches her.I know for a fact, that the saga with the new guy is not over, he lives really close to her (unlike me), and they still follow each other on IG. our last answer hurt his ego, but he will be back I'm sure of it, and she won't know how to act because she will want to talk with him sadly and get compliments more but as I said, It is already known how it will end (me stopping it after she let him push it more and more).\n\nlast thing, F\\*ck the guys that continue trying to get a girl with a bf, where is your bro code?\n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n TL;DR : my gf can't stop getting attention from guys until I tell her to stop, but it hurts me to do so.",

        "text": "To give some context, we met last year November. We hit it off, kinda liked each other and rushed into a relationship one month later (don’t flame me please, I know that was dumb now and that we should have waited longer😭).\n\nAround Jan this year, I realised that when I thought of him, I didn’t get butterflies or didn’t feel silly happy, like I was in my previous relationship. It’s not that I don’t love him, I very much do, but I started hesitating on whether it was romantic or platonic love.\n\nI didn’t bring it up with him because he is the type of overthink, and I didn’t want him to do that. But of course, that was dumb and I should’ve just communicated directly instead.\n\nSo it kept manifesting. It got to the point where I felt uncomfortable whenever we were talking (eg, being worried about acidentally hurting him if I tell him what’s on my mind) and to the point where it just took up my mind the entire time I was at school.\n\nOn the first week of Feb, I finally decided to confide in my besties. None of them actually had dating experience, but I was pretty much desperate at that point.\n\nAfterwards, I made my mind up to break up with him. I shouldn’t lead him on when I myself am unsure about the status of my feelinfs. I cried a lot doing so, because I was scared he’d think I was leaving him.\n\nHe was understandably upset. But he took some time off and since then till now, we have been normal regular friends. \n\nHowever, I get so jealous whenever I see him interact or talk to other girls. I feel oddly possessive and I hate it. It eats away at me inside. This suggests I have feelings for him, but yet again, I still dont get butterflies nor feel silly-happy whenever I think of him, which suggests the opposite.\n\nI know I sound like a douchebag, but I genuinely need to figure out how I feel, or I’ll lose my mind worrying.\n\nWhat should I do? Should I distance myself from him? Has anyone been in this situation? I’ve spent loads of time trying to figure out how I feel, but I seriously don’t know. Please help me.\n\nTLDR: me struggling to figure out my feelings towards a close friend and need some advice",

        "text": "I’ve been with him for 3 months now. He used to be the player type, and hookup from time to time in parties. \nHe always had it easy with girls. But with me, he was really different. He always has been shy, and he seemed like he didn’t talk to any girl in his life lol. I’m his first relationship and first sexual experience, because he wanted to keep it for someone special. \n\nHe treats me really well, want to see me really often and organizes a lot of dates. I already met his mother, and he told me he loved me but I didn’t need to feel the same way. I met almost all his friends, including some of the ones he had kissed. \nHe is a bit needy and really sensitive. He is normally extroverted and easygoing, but with me, he’s always shy and sleepy. He posts me every week, and exposes me like he is proud of me. \nOne day he just called everyone telling them about an achievement of mine, showing me off.\nHe is a bit jealous form time to time but trusts me with his eyes closed. \n\nProblem is, he hooked up with some of his friends, and especially his ex best friend. \n\nI’m usually not the jealous type, but my friends told me to be wary of him. So I sometimes find myself snooping through his phone. He doesn’t care and lets me do so. Every time I feel jealous he tries to reassure me. \n\nHe sometimes go out with friends, but sometimes he goes out with friends that he kissed in a party before. They’re all from the same groupe, he told me he didn’t want to cut contact with some of his good guy friends. \nHe parties often, and invites me every time but I usually don’t go. \nEarly in our relationship, he invited friends to his house, and invited one of that girls which he kissed 8 months before our relationship. He asked me to come but I didn’t want to because I was upset. \n\nHe cut contact with his best friend, because I was really jealous of her. He only talked to her from time to time to catch up. \nHe then cut contact with 2 other girls because they told him he shouldn’t trust me. \n\nHe has a cast to his arm because he had a surgery on his wrist.  \n\nThen came another party, where there was friends he hadn’t seen in a very long time. He had kissed one of the girls there before, but he made me meet them all and felt like I could trust her. He invited me but I couldn’t come. \nWell, he had to sleep there because he had drank alcohol. He was too drunk to drive so he had to sleep there. He texted me all night til I went to sleep.  \n \nWhen we saw each other the next day, he told me that his friend had tried to kiss him, and another girl flirted with him, and tried to convince him to cheat on me. He blocked his friend. \nHe later received a text from the girl’s ex, saying that he was going to kill him because he heard that he had flirted with her. I had his phone when he received that message. He told me he hadn’t flirted with her, that she kept insisting that he should cheat on me. Nevertheless, he admitted having done a mistake. He told me there was only room to sleep on a mattress on the floor, in a room with 4 people. The girl that flirted with him was on that mattress. He told me he slept next to that girl that flirted with him, because he didn’t want to sleep on the floor with his broken arm. He told me that he was sorry, that he only thought about his broken arm, and not about the worries I could have. \nHe kept insisting that he hadn’t flirted with her, and told me that it was okay if I didn’t believe him and that he would understand if I wanted to breakup with him.\n\nI thought about it for a day, and I decided to forgive him him because even if what he did was disrespectful, it’s true that I wouldn’t have wanted him sleeping on the floor with his cast. \nThat girl tried to contact him later on and he showed me the texts and sent her off. \n\nI was jealous of his friends and often snooped through his phone. He sometimes talked to his female friends, but there was nothing compromising. \n\nBut one day, I came to his house. He talked about his day with me, while snooping through his phone, I noticed that he had erased a conversation with his ex best friend. I confronted him about it, and he told me that he just didn’t want me to worry. I found the texts, he tried to stop from reading them, but I red them anyways. \nHe let me read them. He was asking for medication, because he had gotten sick and was next to her house. She didn’t have any medication, but she asked him if he was feeling good or if he needed anything. That night, she was throwing a party where he was invited, but didn’t go because he thought it was disrespectful for me. \nThey texted and caught up, and he made some jokes to her. He was friendly with her. \nI threw a jealousy tantrum and began to cry. I asked why he had erased that conversation. He told me he just didn’t want to start a fight over that conversation because he knew I was jealous about her. He then hugged me and told me that he only wanted me, and that he would be with this other girl if she interested him. \n\nNext week, my friend made fun of him, so he pushed her like he was teasing her. I didn’t really like that because I considered it as flirting.\n\nYesterday, he saw an old friend of her at a party. He sent me snaps of him and her and talked all night long with me. He spent all the night with her, and she invited him to her house for a party. The problem is, he arrived early, so he was alone with her in her house. The other people invited were late. \nHe apologized, and told me he didn’t think they would be so late. He kept apologizing, and answered my texts every 20-30min. I know her, and I know she used to be a good friend of his. Nothing had happened between them. But I threw a jealousy tantrum and told him it was really disrespectful. \n\nI know he loves me, he seems like he is obsessed with me. He wants to live a lot of things with me. He is really affectionate, even in public. He shows me off to all of his friends, and tells me “I love you” 40 times a day. \n\nBut is his behavior a red flag ? Should I be worried that he could be a serial cheater ?\n\nTL;DR : My boyfriend has a weird behavior and I don’t know what to think about it.",

        "text": "Tldr: we’ve moved in together and the sex has dropped off \n\n\n\nLong story short we have a very loving relationship - we kiss and cuddle all the time and always want to be with each other.  But when we first started dating we had sex multiple times a day, and now we live together it’s more like once a week. Because I know he’s a very sexual person I start to get scared I’m not enough for him anymore. We’ve spoken about it and both agree that it’s just hard to fit in sex- we’re working a lot and tired most of the time etc. He said we should try to have sex more but sometimes I feel like my desire to have sex with him is lesser now and I wonder if he feels the same. It’s not that I’m not attracted to him, I just feel so close to him that sex sometimes seems weird. I worry that it’s because he no longer shows as much desire towards me, and that makes me feel awkward about initiating.\n\nDoes this sound familiar/ worrying to anyone? Appreciate any advice",

        "text": "Sorry for the repost. Changed some details (juuuust in case) and also added some clarifications.\n\nThis is a bit complicated so bare with me. And I know what people are going to say about company ink, drama, etc. but if I didn't like this girl a lot I wouldn't ask...\n\nSo my (soon to be ex) wife, this girl, and I all work at the same place but not all in the same area. We've worked together for about 3 years but she's started talking to me more in the past year, specifically since I've become a dad.\n\nShe's quiet, shy, and reserved but she's become increasingly chatty with me and I find these days she really tries to keep the conversation flowing. She asks me a lot more personal stuff and volunteers it more often as well. I thought maybe this was because she knew my wife, but apparently they aren't really friends (they don't dislike each other, they just don't interact much by choice). This girl has even forgotten my wife's name a couple times when asking about her. (And yes their department is small enough that she probably should have remembered her name.) Could also be me reading into things, but whenever I've mentioned my wife I feel like she either looks down/away or seems a bit less interested in what I'm saying.\n\nWe had a particularly good conversation the other day, and I feel like her body language was good. It may not be interest, but I feel like she's at least comfortable with me. She was making a lot of eye contact with me, much more than she used to. We would occasionally break eye contact and then regain it, not sure if that's good or bad? She would look away when telling me something that seemed like it was painful. For example, when she told me her mom passed away she'd look down for a few seconds. But when talking about happy things (like our kids) she'd usually maintain prolonged eye contact. I also noticed if I ever mention my (soon to be) ex she can get a bit quiet.\n\nWe actually had a really in depth talk about personal stuff such as where we grew up, our family members, parents who have passed away, our kids (she's a single mom), etc. She also started asking about where my family live now, what nickname I have for my son, etc. She's also started getting more... vulnerable I guess, talking about cost of living pressure and stuff like that. Not super in depth, just passing comments but still ones revealing personal information. She also started telling me how she feels about our town, frustrations she's had with finding things to do (particularly with her kid), etc.\n\nMy friend happened to be there for the conversation and afterwards he said \"She sure likes you.\" I asked what he meant and he said she never talks to him that much, only pleasantries. Upon talking to some of the other guys I work with, they've all basically said the same thing. She did briefly interact with this guy while I was there, but only when I brought him into the conversation and she didn't seem like she knew what to say to him.\n\nAnother thing, she's been making more jokes with me and laughing my (very lame) jokes. The other day I could tell she was looking for someone and I said \"Hey you look lost, you ok?\" Our eyes met, she had a really big smile, and then looked down. She giggled a bit and said \"Oh yeah, I'll find myself in a minute.\" or something kinda dorky like that.\n\nShe could just be more comfortable with me, but I feel like she's taken a particular interest in me the last 6 to 12 months as I said. About 7 months or so back, we had a conversation about my son and ever since then she's much more talkative to me. Not sure if they're related. She's said once she's good at judging people's vibes, so maybe she just thinks I'm a good dad and is more comfortable with me now idk.\n\nAgain, not going to get mixed up with this, at least for the foreseeable future (until wife and I are officially split, and also my wife is changing jobs eventually) but it would be good to know at least for future reference because I kinda suck at taking hints, but also don't want to make something out of nothing. I'd like to at least stay friends and see where things go down the track.\n\nI guess part of me thinks she knows I'm married and she knows my wife directly, so I think why would she be interested/showing interest. But on the other hand she treats me differently to at least most of the men we work with, and my friend seems to think she likes me more than normal. She definitely doesn't know my wife and I are splitting yet. It's really hard to say because she isn't as expressive as most women I know, so I'm having to really analyze small details at times. I also feel like I'm not really her \"type\" physically which is another reason I think maybe there isn't anything more to this and she just enjoys my company.\n\nTL;DR - Not sure if my coworker is reservedly flirting with me / showing interest because I'm (technically) still married, or whether she's just comfortable with me.",

I find myself thinking he is talking to other girls and is cheating on me. He seems to think it is very wrong I dated some friend of his from school (while we were broken up). My family doesn’t think we should be together. I have separation anxiety when we are not together or fighting. Every time I think I’m going to end it I’m unable to do so and end up fixing our issues. We have fights and not arguments. And I feel this great sense of relief when things become okay. But when we are fighting I have horrible anxiety that I can’t sleep properly and I can’t eat properly. Are we in a toxic relationship or do we just don’t know how to fight in a healthy manner ?",

        "text": " \n\n**Some quick info:**\n\nTogether for 3.5 years. She's in med school about to graduate, I'm self-employed and can work no problem from anywhere in the world. She constantly brings up kids and marriage.\n\nI live in our (both of us') hometown while she spends most of her time in another city 2 hours away where her studies are.\n\nI have my own rented place in our hometown, which I got after she left me for \"not making her happy and being a Momma's boy, which shows I'm not fit to be a responsible man alongside her\". I was like, OK, I need to do this to prove her wrong (in a good way) but also for myself no matter what happens. So I got this apartment and I LOVE living here independently and we ended up back together.\n\n**Now, for the conondrum:**\n\nThings have been going well for the past 6 months after I got the apartment, but my girlfriend's roomate evacuated the premises recently and now she wants to live together. I was like, OK, let's give it a try.\n\nWell, long story short, I like it and I enjoy spending a lot of time with her. **BUT I have zero friends over there and my day amounts to just working on my laptop for an hour or two** (that's how much I usually work), working out a bit, and waiting for her to come back from the hospital or going to the local grocery store for a few food items.\n\nAnd after a week or so of this, I really feel the need to hang out with my friends and generally spend some time in my hometown. I'm a bit of a homebody, too, so I feel out of place there.\n\n**So, after a bit of figthing and living together, I gathered up the courage to tell my girlfriend that I'd like to spend a week in our hometown (she has family and friends there too) and a week in her city.** That way, I can spend quite a bit of time with her and still see my friends, though I'd be leaving her to live alone for a whole week. At least until September when she graduates, and then we can figure out what to do. At the moment, she plans to go to a city even farther way from our hometown because of the job opportunities.\n\n**Whenever I share this with my my girlfriend, she tells me that I'm \"really disappointing\"**, that my friends are \"mostly losers\" and that they \"don't really care about you, if they did they would come visit us\" and \"if two people really want to be together, they won't care about leaving a few friends and family behind and just be enough for eachother and create their own family\".\n\nI replied that I don't think it's fair to talk that way because I do want to be with her, but I can't really rationalize the feelings I have. Also, while I have no friends in her city, she does have a couple close friends and a \"medical\" social circle at her internship in the hospital, so it's easier for her to say those things.\n\nHer reply? \"If you really want to make it work you could join a gym or something and find likeminded people. It's not that hard\".\n\nOK, I agreed with her here, but I have no intention of going to the gym (I like working out at home) and I literally have had the same friends for the last 15+ years. I'm not saying making new friends is impossible, I'm actually fairly social, but I've met so many people and yet I'm hanging out with the same dudes all my life.\n\nUltimately, she told me that she's not willing to live alone every other way week because it shows \"a lack of commitment\" to her and that since I'm reluctant to live in her city and leave my life behind now, I'd be even more reluctant when it comes to moving to the one she plans to go to once she graduates.\n\nAnd she's right for the last part, I just wish we could live in our hometown. But there's less opportunities for her here professionally (though she comes from a well-off family and I make quite a bit of money as well) and she's always prioritized her career over the relationship. I can't blame her for that, as much as it pains me to have this conflict. And I've always been one to prioritize relationships over money, or at least adapt my money-making to not interfere with my relationships (both romantically and friends).\n\nWe just had another call about it and I tried to stand my ground. She basically told me it's either we live together and go home every 2-3 weeks for 2 days or break up. I tried reasoning with her but she's dead set in her thinking and has even used my being self-employed against me saying \"If the roles were reversed and I had an online job like you, I wouldn't have any issues doing this.\"\n\n**Now, I know some of you might want to know WHY I am reluctant to leave everything behind for her, and it's because:**\n\n1. I'm not sure if I want to get married or have kids in the next 1-2 years while for her it's non-negotiable\n2. She has a history of \"my way or the highway\" way of going about things and I feel like my opinion and decisions are looked over and that makes me feel less of a man\n3. Whenever we have a fight or ague about something, I spent years apologizing every time to her because it always ended up being my fault somehow. At some point I reallized she never even took half or PART of the blame, it was always me taking it in full. I'm worried about kids and financial/budget issues that could arise with her when we have this dynamic.\n4. History of abuse.  \nThis is hard to put in words without making her seem like a bad person since she isn't and can be very caring and sweeter than anyone has ever been to me, but she's called me hurtful/disrespectful names a few times in the past whenever things don't go her way and stormed off in a fit of rage. She also hit me once (well, repeteadly, in the shoulder) and threw my things (laptop) across the room and then locked herself in the bathroom because I changed plans last minute for going out. She also called me a \"junkie\" because I had smoked weed a few minutes prior while she knows I started smoking for medical reasons. I assumed she wouldn't be happy but I didn't expect such a reaction.  \nBut the worst part, in my opnion, is that after we talked about it and I said what she did wasn't right and asked her why she did it, she said \"Yeah, I feel bad for what happened but you just made me so angry\". She never apologized and in fact expected me to make up for it. However, that was 1.5 years ago and hasn't happened again.\n5. We're not very sexually compatible in terms of libido. Even in the honeymoon phase of our relationship, I made many unreciprocated advances. She's also witheld sex and affection when I was broke and didn't have a business, explicitly stating so.\n\nDespite all of that above, I still feel attached and love her. I've had so many amazing memories over the past 3.5 years with her, we travelled a lot and did many romantic and loving things together. But I'm finding it hard to get over the issues above and just jump at the opportunity to leave everything I have behind for her.\n\nI need some serious help. Any replies would be appreciated. I'm worried that I might let go a person who genuinely wants to be with me. I don't know. Thanks so much to whoever takes the time to read my fucking life story!\n\n**TLDR: Girlfriend with history of some abuse wants me to uproot and move with her to her city (and then another). I miss my friends and environment in our hometown, so I'm willing to compromise spending a week in her city and a week in mine. She isn't, and has explicitly stated that we either live together and take our relationship to the next level or we break up. I need help, obviously.**",

We have 2 beautiful kids together and for the most part it feels like soulmates. The thing we lack in the most is communication. I’m constantly anxious and worrying that my other half is going to up and leave. She gives me absolutely no reason to think that she is, the bedroom antics are great, she tells me she loves me and she makes it clear as black and white that she is not leaving me. \n\nBack in late 2021 we had a really really rough patch. I detached myself from my family and my priorities were extortionately wrong. She broke it off with me. She  admitted she was speaking to someone else and photos were exchanged. I feel this was more of an emotional sort of relationship and when this happened she had already broken things off with me so there was no foul play involved. We worked on things and we got back together *officially* around 3 months later. \n\nThis person is known to us both and has felt like a staple in our relationship since, she has shut him down and blocked him on several several occasions so the trust is there. I just worry I’m not being the person she needs me to be and I don’t quite know how to be *that person* \n\nI’ve been down the old route before of seeing a GP, getting tablets etc etc but it’s more of an insecurity I have in myself. I’m not a 10/10 and I don’t feel that I’m the best dad I can be. I constantly feel in myself that I’m holding her back and she could do so much better and be much happier. \n\nIdeally, a therapist isn’t something I want to delve into but I’d really like to hear what I could do to try and help myself and my relationship before I blow it into a millions pieces. \n\nTL;DR: my own problems caused bad patches of our past. How do I get passed them for the longevity of my relationship and family.",

He confessed and said sometimes he did while before he always made me feel like I was crazy and he never checked them. Now I cannot trust him.\n\nHi, so my boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years and we live together. He never had instagram before we met and 2 months after we met he created an instagram account (it was kinda for me). When he first created his account, the explore page was completely half naked women and I guess that was because this was the content his friends were following and liking and he was a man and stuff. I didn’t like it but I didn’t care so much since it was a new account. But it never changed. He never followed or like this kind of content and even though he followed other kind of accounts (he never used instagram actively though) this half naked women content was still all over his explore page. I was always disturbed by it but never really told him to get rid of it. However one day a couple of months ago I was fed up with it then I took his phone in front of him and clicked on “not interested” in this kind of content. He got angry ay me and called me crazy jealous and said “he never checks them anyways” and “would I also distroy a strip club in out street even if would never go in but pass by it everyday”. Then I felt bad for doing what I did. Then after 2 months, which was a couple of weeks ago, I somehow caught him (long story) checking a girl on instagram and then I asked him if he was checking the girls on his explore page and he said sometimes he did. We had a really big fight and I am really disgusted by him. He deleted his instagram account for me but I feel so angry and disgusted for being told for almost 2 years that he wasn’t checking that content and when I clicked on “not interested” him calling me crazy for that but at the end he was actually checking them out. I love him very much and he is a nice guy but he destroyed my trust in two ways; he gaslighted and manipulated me by lying to me &amp; calling me crazy and he checked other girls regularly when he is in a relationship. I don’t know if I can trust him anymore.",

        "text": " \n\nDon't want to make this an essay but had to just talk this out. I had an old co-worker, there was something between us but timing was off. Despite her making a very direct move on me first I was at the time her supervisor and so I rejected the pass because I had just gotten the promotion and I didn't want to jeopardize my job. (Romantic office relationships were not encouraged and as her supervisor I would have been putting both our jobs at risk if it didn't work out.) Year later she got a boyfriend and became even in my position. Still a lot of romantic/sexual tension but we both didnt act on it.\n\nFew years ago right before the pandemic she left the field to take on a new job over 2,000 miles away. I made her a playlist expressing my feelings in a sense before she left, but she still had a boyfriend and I didn't want to overstep my bounds. Fast forward to about a year ago I see she's broken up with her boyfriend who did not want to move to her new city.\n\nSo I'm in town for a work conference and I message her, we had stayed in touch on and off but we haven't seen in each other in roughly 4 years and we hadn't truly spoken since just right before she and her boyfriend broke up. I message her asking her if I can meet up with her that weekend, within 5 minutes she replies with an emphatic \"YES!\"\n\nWe meet up and talk for several hours, catching up. During which she admits that she is seeing someone but in her words \"It's not serious, nor does she want it to become serious.\" And that she wants to move back to the city I still reside in. So after a while I just lay it out and tell her how I feel and I drop the \"L\" bomb which kinda just came out. Wasn't going to go that hard but it just came out. She was smiling throughout, she also stammered quite a bit, rare for her, and didn't really form complete sentences. It was like major deer in headlights territory, it took her a bit to even say anything. But at the end asked her what she was feeling and she said she didn't want to do long distance again and that while not serious about her current beau, doesn't want to just turn around and walk out on him. We part ways I go back home.\n\nI'm not sure what to do here, I feel I don't want to apply pressure on her, she didn't give an answer one way or another with her feelings on me. Just where she is mentally. I know that I should get out there and just date around, but I also don't want to lose this potential relationship with someone who has been a consistent love for around 6 years. I guess what's the move here, just hope she is able to make it back to my city or do I need to be a bit more assertive here? I don't want to crowd her I laid a lot on her. But I know the feelings are still there on both ends, heck for crying out loud I know and she has told me she still listens to the playlist I made her. We've held a flame for each other for 6 years through a lot of weird and bad timing. So did I misread her? Did I overstep? Should I forget about her? Do I just gotta hope for good timing again? Would appreciate any insight at all here.\n\n\\*\\*tl;dr\\*\\*: Told a long time flame my feelings for her but don't know if I overloaded her and if now I just wait for the ball in her court or if I become more assertive to let her know that I'm truly serious about a full fledged relationship.",

        "text": "\nLong story short, me and this girl met off Instagram and really hit it off but I can’t tell if she really likes me or not. She’s good looking enough for me and seemed like she had a cool personality so I let her follow me, i only have people on Instagram that I personally know. I was trying to win a giveaway for a car and so was she, so that’s how she found me (someone reposted me) none of us won but she would reply to me stories and like them. ( no one really likes my stories as I don’t have a lot of followers.) \n\nI’m into race cars and I smoke so that’a pretty much the only things I post about, and apparently she likes that kinda stuff too… so a couple weeks ago she responds to my story about something I had posted and I reply we should get to know each other better, she said she was up for it next week (which was last week.) mind you we never met, talked or nothing. So we’re talking leading up to our first date I guess you could say, but we were just talking as friends first as I didn’t know her intentions but she seems interested when we would text. We finally meet and instantly had chemistry. We talked about a lot of stuff and it seemed like she was was into me. Must I mention I have a couple cars and I’m doing good financially. I’m hoping this doesn’t matter to her and that she’s not just using me. But she did post on Instagram one day that she missed someone ( which was me) and I replied saying I miss her too and she got happy. I’ve been single for years and I feel like she can probably be my next girlfriend but there are a couple red flags. She goes to parties, she has an older girl-friend who’s 35, and she has a couple guy friends that she says she doesn’t like like that. For the past week, we’ve hung out a couple times and it was a always a fun, great time ;). I feel like she tells me everything, which is why I can’t stop thinking about her but the red flags are what’s keeping me from talking about actually getting with her. We haven’t talked about that as I’ve only known her about a week, but from the convos we had, it feels like I’ve known her years now. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I wrong for thinking about her this much when she could be playing me? Am I overthinking? Is a couple weeks to fast to get with somebody? Do I make my move? \n\ntl;dr: I got a situationship with this girl I recently met, we like each other and i wanna take it further but idk if it’s too early because there’s a few red flags",

        "text": "TL;DR - my best friend is currently part of a group of friends that she doesn’t seem to want to make me part of, in any capacity, despite the fact that she knows I don’t currently have a lot of friends &amp; a big social life due to life circumstances which I can at times feel quite insecure about.\n\nHello,\n\nI have someone that I talk to every day and have been for the past 6 months or so. I’ve been calling her a best friend for all this time, spent weeks writing a heart-felt essay for her birthday which she seems to have liked at the time and at the time I really did feel a huge amount of platonic love for her and thought ‘well, I guess I have finally found that one best friend’ - but unfortunately, everything has taken a slightly different turn recently. \n\nI’m currently in a full time 9-5 job and am also doing some studies as preparation for uni too (I’m only 19), so currently I don’t have the most prosperous social life ever and some big group of friends to hang out with as that’s just not what my life is about atm, especially with a 9-5 job that it takes me 1,5 on average to travel to. Her life however is very different to mine - she is doing a part time Master’s degree and some part time (very flexible) office work from home sometimes, and she is also part of a theatre group located in the same town where we both live. \n\nRecently, she‘s been going out with them a lot, which in itself is absolutely fine but here’s the catch - for at least a couple of months now I’ve been saying ‘hey, would be cool if I could join you sometime or we could maybe organise something separate together?’, and still - nothing. She’s been doing this theatre thing for nearly a year and  I still have not been introduced to a single one of her friends in all this time. And I have also told her, on multiple occasions, how much I struggle with this ‘oh I don’t seem to have enough of a social life’ story and how I can be quite insecure about that at times. \n\nThere was actually one time when she’d invited me round to hers and said ‘oh if that’s ok I’m meeting up with some theatre friends after so you won’t be able to stay for long?’, I was like ‘yeah of course’, then I went round to hers, spent about an hour there, then I’d WALKED HER TO THE PUB WHERE THEY WERE DUE TO BE MEETING and then left. And now it just makes me wonder: ‘what exactly was stopping her from saying to me: hey, would you like to come too and meet everyone?’. Why is it that we have to arrange some whole kind of separate thing where I could join and I’m not able to just join them spontaneously? I’m just starting to feel so separate from her core chunk of friends at the moment that it’s genuinely starting to hurt me. Do you think I’m in the wrong to feel this way here?\n\nThanks",

        "text": "For context, I (23f) have always had a good relationship with my mother (60f). We’re pretty close, so that’s why I’m so hurt.\n\nRecently I changed therapists and after some investigation, got the diagnosis that I’m indeed on the spectrum. That’s fine, I’m even kind of happy with that! It explains the quirks, outbursts and social awkwardness I’ve had my entire life. \n\nI was hesitant to tell my parents because one of my older sisters (I’m the youngest of four siblings) is special needs and will probably need care for the rest of her life. I thought that they’d be needlessly anxious about the diagnosis and it’s implications for their other daughter, so I decided to tell mom first as my dad is a worrier and I thought she’d have my back.\n\nThe conversation went like this:\n\nMe: […] so that’s how I got the oficial diagnosis, but don’t worry, I’m pretty ok with it!\n\nHer: That’s good. I always knew you were like this.\n\nMe: …what?\n\nHer: Yeah, it’s why you’re so smart. All autistic people are geniuses\n\nLike… I know she meant well, but then I started grilling her about how long she knew. She said that when I was 9 I read 18 250-page books in a 20 day beach vacation, so she asked a doctor friend and he “helped her understand”? Finally I asked her why she never said anything about her suspicions to me or my old therapist, and she said it wasn’t affecting me negatively so it wasn’t important????\n\nHM EXCUSE ME MOM, but feeling like I was an alien my whole life and being relentlessly bullied at school for being weird was VERY NEGATIVE!! It led into severe mental illness and like 4 suicide attempts!!! Don’t you think maybe mentioning it to my therapist at the time was a LITTLE BIT in my best interest???? \n\nI wish i told her that, but i just left after the conversation and now I’m writing this. Should I even confront her about it again? It won’t change the past. I do believe she did it thinking she was doing what was best, but I’m pretty upset. What to do? \n\nTL:DR: my mom has suspected I’m autistic since I was 9 and never told me or my therapists because “autistic people are very intelligent and it never affected you negatively”",

        "text": "\nThis is going to be long. I have been with my fiancé for almost 4 years. Our relationship has been rocky since the beginning, but we have stuck by each other because of how good the good times are.\nI'm questioning if I am the toxic one. My fiancé is older than me.. by a decent amount and I know a bunch of people are against that, so maybe there's a reason for that | suppose.\n1 have caught him many times texting other girls and sending nudes but have always forgiven him. He is also a mean spirited person in general. Constantly telling me he doesn't care if we're together or not and I really try to think he doesn't mean it. But maybe he does. He withholds affection if I do something to annoy him and he threatens me with cheating if I continue to worry that he is or if I question him at all. He says that if I think he is already, then he might as well do it. So I try to do everything to avoid that. I try to always keep him happy sc he won't try to find it in someone else and I have sex with him anytime he wants. This makes me feel very pathetic. Like something is wrong with me I don't know why he has such a strong hold over me.\n\nI have a problem with walking away, once I start getting upset it's very hard for me to stop talking. Me and my fiancé have very awful communication, he refuses to talk about important things in our relationship which is where a lot of our fights stem from and it's usually me begging him to please talk to me about it and it escalates. It always leads to him stonewalling. And by that I mean to the extreme. He closes his eyes, looks away and goes silent no matter what I say. I can beg and beg for him to please talk to me. To please stop. We've talked about how much it hurts me and how little it makes me feel, he doesn't care and says he does it to teach me a lesson. It makes me feel sick.\n\nThis just happened tonight, I've had a really hard day today, super depressed about stuff going on in my life.\nOnce we got into bed I asked him if we could talk and he could just hold me while I vented. He rolled his eyes and told me he didn't care but he would listen and wouldn't say anything back. So that made me feel awkward which led to me sobbing and begging him to care. Very pathetic.\nSo he ends up just telling me to talk and he put his arm around me and rubbed my side, I felt so weird tho and kept going on about how weird I felt. And I was just so upset that he didn't care and he started ignoring me at that point. So I cried and begged him to please talk to me and this went on for maybe 30 minutes of me hysterically crying and begging. I feel very stupid for this. I ended up getting so upset I tried to lift him up like towards me to get him to give me some sort of response and then I shoved him back down on tho the bed. I was like straddled on him btw. So that's when he got angry.\nRightfully so. Since I put my hands on him. I have never done this before. I don't know what happened. and so he got up and said he was going to the living room and he was done with me. We argued for an hour and I begged him to lay back down. He eventually did. I'm sure he's done with me. I'm so upset I did this.\nBut yeah I don't know what the point of this post was. I guess to just get it off my chest. I am so unbelievably sad.\n1 know I am in an emotionally abusive relationship, but I love him so much I have been willing to stay. And now I'm afraid he's going to leave me and I fucked everything up I really think I may be the abusive one at this point I don't know anymore I feel so crazy. He tells me it's my fault. So maybe it is. I could really use some support right now I don't want to be this way if it is me\n \n[TLDR] Fiancé of 4 years is emotionally abusive and constantly stonewalls me. We got into a argument tonight about me wanting to talk about an emotional day I had which led to him stonewalling and me shoving him to try to get him to respond to me. I have never done that before I feel horrible.",

        "text": "So me (18F) and boyfriend (18M) have been together for 3 years. We are long distance but we used to make it work. \n\nAt the beginning of our relationship it was very nice and I had so much fun despite us being long distance. There were something's that I really regret not doing during this relationship.\n\n2 years ago, he has this close friend. At the time, I trusted him with her because he didn't break my trust. However, I started to feel anxious and jealous because she'd post sexual content of herself and he'd like those images. I know that liking an image means nothing, but to me it was very disrespectful. I started to feel very left out because she and him would hang out. She would influence his style and looks, etc. even his career goal. It definitely did hurt my feelings and I confronted him about it. He said I didn't have anything to worry about so I brushed it off. \n\nThen later on that year he cheated on me. We exchanged our passwords on our social media during the beginning of our relationship. Being young and dumb I didn't think anything about it. During that time, he logged me out of his account and I didn't pay any mind to it. On a normal day, I was browsing on my blocked accounts and saw that some girl who I didn't recognize was on there. I unblocked her account only to see him comment on sexual things about her breasts and body. Although it wasn't physical cheating, it still hurt my feelings. Of course, I did confront him about it, and we were both crying on call. He begged me to not leave him because he himself did not know why he did it. He said that he loved me and he would never cheat on me again. 'Til this day I don't know why he did it, or if that girl goes to the same school as he did. Being lonely and on medication, I don't think I fully got to experience the whole cheating thing and it's only hitting me now.\n\nI also barely realized NOW realized that I actually get anxiety from this relationship. Now I am going through the emotions that I should've been going through 2 years ago. When I see that he follows another girl I immediately start panicking and shaking. I feel like he's going to start flirting with her or cheat on me. I know I need therapy because of this. I want him to understand the pain that I went through. I feel so hurt that I was always there for him, always sacrificing myself for him. Whenever he was down or needed the support, I was always there. I was there through it all. I told him how I felt and he assured me that he's not doing anything. Deep down I still have that fear lingering inside of me.\n\nIt's been very hard and I fight for what I want in this relationship. We get into arguments constantly. He works now and he can't text me at all because of his job. He has a hard job so I understand why he can't text me all the time. I've expressed to him that I understand he can't text me everyday and I don't expect that. But what I do expect is on the days he doesn't work is to talk to me. I've told him that I wish he'd be there whenever I needed him. When I needed support he wouldn't really give it to me. When I'd text him for that support it'd just be brief comforting and then he would not answer me for hours. He says that he cares about me but it doesn't feel like it. I'm not sure if it's because he's emotionally unavailable or he just doesn't care. Sometimes he won't even text me for a day. We haven't even called or played games for 6 months. As of right now, he hasn't answered me for 2 days and I saw him go ONLINE. I've told him that if he wants to stop talking to me then to just tell me. I just feel so lost. I don't even know what's going on with him, he doesn't tell me about his day or feelings. It's not fair because when he wanted that attention/support I'd sacrifice my sleep or whatever just so I can make him feel comforted. He tells me he DOES give me that time but he doesn't even text me. It's not fair because I've been feeling so lonely that I start to isolate myself and that's when he CARES. That's when he tries to call me and text me. Then he says that he tries to give me the attention but I ignore it. It's making me so confused.\n\nI just don't know anymore, I want to stay in this relationship but it's hurting me physically and emotionally. It's giving me so much anxiety and I start shaking and crying. He tells me he's going to come and see me but I can't take my anxiety.\n\nI've developed this mentality that he's my soul mate and I know it's dumb. I know I need therapy and I will probably get it soon.\n\nTD;LR because of boyfriends actions such as cheating, ignoring, etc. makes me feel so lost and resentful in the relationship that I don't know how to save it.",

I am that type of guy who is talkative and can't just let a girl chase on me like can't show attitude to her cz i feel bad if I do that and after two months the time told her my feelings i got to know she has attachment issues and will just dislike a guy anytime i was like if it has worked past two months it'll work now and I can be him as i just got feelings for her.\n\nAfter a month i realised she isnt talking with me much and sort of ignoring me i was like she might be busy as exams were going on already. but she was with her friends and was chilling out with them I felt bad and like sort of started sry texting her and in some days I got to know as she told me that at this point she doesn't want any relationship and can't commit to me, she might lose feelings for me anyways and she has a lot of things to explore and she friend zoned me. \n\nSo I just want to ask you all should I wait for her, or just let her go as i have this feeling she might come to me.if you want more context it's fine but I really need help and i am shattered as i m a guy who once attached can't lose anyone and also have fear of rejection.\n\nI M USING REDDIT FOR THE FIRST TIME.\nIs it like she didn't cared about me or what i felt at that particular time as i genuinely liked her and didn't want all this to happen she told that she wants to explore and so she might go into any makeouts. she told me I am a fun and positive guy to be arround and friend zoned me even though she knew I liked her.\n\nshould I wait more for her until she wants a relationship and keep on following her on social media or just let her go. But I still feel she might get hurt if I do that as she genuinely didn't want me to get hurt and so told everything what she felt. She i meet her once in private and ask her what does she actually feels. I really don't understand anything but it's like i finally found a girl my type and just can't move on so quick because I really get attached real quick also she said she liked chasing.\n\nTL;DR: i don't feel i should leave her and i also feel i should leave her.",
