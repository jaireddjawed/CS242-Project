        "text": "It's taken me three times to finally write this post - not because I'm scared to (over)share, but because **wallowing in this feeling of intellectualized unhappiness** gave me the false impression of control - I JUST have to write this one post on reddit et voila, I am gonna be happy again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not expecting to feel much happier from this, but venting has always been a great strategy to for me to relieve stress and to actually think it all through. Plus input can often be very helpful. **What are the underlying issues?** I am feeling very unhappy about myself - for the first time ever in my (30) life. This sensation \"seems\" to be based on two key factors, but I'm gonna give a little context. I had a breakup roughly 10 months ago that hurt me very badly. I was commited to \"marry that woman\"; not because she was the right one, but because I was simply that commited. I am \"over her\" and that breakup to at least 95%. I am not over that relationship as much, as various situations are still hurting me. Now, **what are those key factors**?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **I am feeling very lonely**. I get to see people every day at work, but on the weekends, I have to get outside. Preferably with friends, but even on Sundays, staying inside is making me feel terrible. I've got a decent amount of friends, enough of them close enough to call good friends I can share anything with - and I am generally surrounded by people I like 6/7 times a day. But I am still feeling incredibly lonely. This loneliness makes me seek quick attention; usually in a civil manner that isn't creepy or very needs - but it's still hurting me to see that attention fade into nothingness once **I** recognize I don't actually like talking to that person that much. I have even ended friendships that were bad for me because I couldn't keep them despite my constant need of attention. I want that attention from any gender, I am just more open about certain things with women and it's sometimes giving me the sensation of \"motherhood\" which I am otherwise not experiencing right now. If I could, I would be outside constantly not to be alone in my apartment staring at three large screens on my own; this is physically draining. I am feeling lonely being with my best friends, too.\n2. **I am basing my self-value and self-worth on LOVING others**. Of course, I want to be loved, too, but being able **TO GIVE LOVE** to someone is how I feel I am valuable to society. This behavior has caused me crushing on people on the past months. **Crushing** on someone makes me happy as hormones are rushing through my body - it's also giving me the false impression of being worth something to someone. Unfortunately, crushing and making up scenarios in my head has caused me pain once Imagination meets Reality. As my feelings are not \"reciprocated\" in the way I want them to be (which is both BEING loved and GETTING attention), I feel hurt and depressed. Usually, this feeling only lasts a couple of hours, but it's happened over and over again. If you're a somewhat smart and beautiful female and you are going to be nice to me, chances \"were\" I was going to crush on you. I have even caught myself imagining scenarios with women I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with (because they are not my age).\n\nI have realized that these two - in combination and individually - make me feel so unhappy and lonely. I haven't felt unhappy or lonely before my last relationship and certainly not during the relationship. I am generally a secure person, including dating and loving my partner. These behaviors weren't \"as\" present before and they didn't have an impact on any relationship before. Also, either factor is in play even when I'm dating someome (which I am; I am just crushing on others). I have found myself to engage with people so not to feel alone, however, which has caused me to brake things off with them, which - in turn - makes me feel even lonelier.\n\nI've got \"great\" social skills, I am great at my job, I've got really good and close friends, I am making enough money to live a good life, I am cherished by others for who I am, I've got fun and engaging hobbies that bring me joy, I am taking care of my body and household, I am at least average looking with an above average height, I am taking care of others and like making them happy without wanting anything back (despite point 1 and 2) etc. etc. **In short, \"people would say\" I've got my life together**. \n\n**But yet, here I am, feeling as desperate, unhappy, lonely and needy as never before.**\n\nThis little bit of jorunaling is probably going to help, right before I am going to overshare to yet another person that isn't a therapist. I can only go to bed when I am really tired, that's the only time of the day I am alone and don't want to cry.",

They don’t think they need to improve themselves, they think they are perfect, and they think their mentality and habits are perfectly fine; when in all honesty they are bad and are ruining their self-esteem, physical health, and mentality. \n\nWhen they’ve asked for help I’ve tried to suggest that they should try to start building good habits and get onto self-improvement. But everytime I do, they’ll be stubborn and want a quick-and-easy path. I’ll tell them that improvement won’t be quick and easy, but instead will be more challenging; then I’ll give them a little tip that’s worked for me and others. But they’ll still say, “Oh that’s too long,” or ,”I don’t want to work hard.” One of them also said, “I’ll only ever choose the easiest option where I don’t have to work hard.”\n\nI feel as it these “friends” are becoming less and less… good when I keep improving myself. They have decent intentions and I don’t want to put the in a bad light, but this is reality. I have been becoming better friends with better people recently so if I end up giving up on trying (because they’ll never listen) I’ll have better people to go to. But I don’t know how to handle this situation and make the “best” outcome.\n\nTLDR: I want to improve but my long-time friends won’t and I don’t know what to do.",

I’ve been taking small steps using card prompts to become more confident approaching and starting conversations with complete strangers. So far with the process I’ve learnt:\n\n  \n**It’s all in your head.**  \nOkay, maybe not all of it but a lot more than you’d think. As soon as you get out of your own head and you start approaching people and you start talking you realise that most people are nice.  \n**Knowing != Believing.**  \nWe all know on an intellectual level that approaching a stranger won’t result in any harm. Does that do anything to help our nerves? Absolutely not! If you want to become more confident speaking with people, then you have to speak with people. The good thing about doing it my way with slow increments is that it hasn’t as daunting as say, telling yourself to go up and speak to 5 people every day.  \n**Focus on the other person.**  \nWhen you shine the light on someone else, they’re more often than not really excited and happy at just being seen. When you ask someone how they are, look into their eyes and smile, it makes a difference to them and you can tell.  \n**People are only strangers as long as you let them be.**  \nA nice side-effect from speaking to people around me is that now, I have a community of poeple I see and interact with. Instead of man I see at the cafe, it’s now George who used to work in marketing. The world gets a bit more cosy when you start saying hello to those around you.  \n**Open ended questions rule.**  \nTypically I’d go about asking very dead end questions which surprise surprise, ended with dead end answers. By expanding questions, intruiging further and starting with ‘who, what, where, when, why’, I’ve really expanded my conversational repetoire.  \n**I’m not there yet.**  \nThe idea of approaching a cute girl across the bar and starting a conversation from scratch is still daunting but it’s a hell of a lot closer than it was when I started.  \n**TLDR**:  \nGet out of your own head.  \nUnderstanding it’s scary ≠ is no longer scary.  \nEveryone enjoys being the focus of attention.  \nThe world gets smaller with every interaction you have.  \n“Why do you do what you do” &gt; “What do you do?”.  \nI’m not there yet but I’m further along than I was.",

Is there a term for this I could search or any general reading advice ? The articles I have found are basically from the “offended” position and do not offer the “offender” any advice to get better.

        "text": "I [16 M] has been getting emotional over small things lately. And one of these things is a girl. I know this is stereotypical but bear with me. I live a very good life. Great parents, friends, stable economy and all you could want in a good life. I have so much of things that others don’t have. So why should I cry over this girl? I don’t even know why I like her. She’s always mean to me and makes me feel bad about myself. \n\nRecently Valentine’s Day happened, and at the end of the school day I meet this girl in the hallway. She was standing with our friend group. (She and I are apart of the same friend group) When they saw me they started ripping on me that I would be alone on Valentine’s Day. I laughed like usual and went home. I had been thinking about this interaction the whole buss ride home. I lay on my bed listening to music like normal, when this girl snaps me. I get excited like any teenage boy would. I open it and my heart breaks. It’s a snap with this girl and her friends joking about me to my face. I snap back trying to not make the situation awkward. I put my phone down and just stare at the ceiling. My mom later comes into my room and gives me chocolates, telling me she loves me. I thank her and the second my door closes. I shed a tear. One single tear falling down my cheek.\n\nBut why should I feel this? I have no reason to be this sad over a small thing like this. know people personally who has gone way worse then me and I just feel so confused. Why am I allowed to feel sad over this? I wish my mind would be stronger. If I wasn’t financially stable or had terrible parents then I would have a great reason to cry. But I am lucky enough to live in a good country, with a good family and have good friends. I don’t deserve to feel this sad. \n\nBefore you comment “it’s okay to have your emotions” or “it’s okay for men to cry” then I want you to give me the reason why it’s okay.\n\nAnyways sorry if this is hard to read, I am not the best at English and my writing skills are not the greatest, thank you for reading.",

It may seem like a small thing, but it has had a huge impact on my overall well-being.\n\nThe life hack is this: every morning when I wake up, I take just five minutes to write down three things that I am grateful for. These can be big things or small things, like the sun shining or having a warm bed to sleep in. Then, I take another five minutes to write down three things that I want to accomplish that day. This helps me stay focused and motivated throughout the day.\n\nSince starting this practice, I have noticed a significant improvement in my mood and overall outlook on life. I feel more grateful and appreciative of the things I have, and I am more motivated to work towards my goals.\n\nStay happy!",

To keep it short: I'm almost 30 and I really am at a great point in my life. Have a high-paying and fun job, get to travel and can afford many things. Sometimes when I have discussions with my friends they wonder: 'Why are you complaining?'.  \n\n\nIt turns out that although I can afford to have a great life, there are a few things on my mind that I want to change as I feel like they affect my every day life:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Stop smoking after doing so since I was a teenager and quite a lot (half a pack a day)\n* Start eating more healthy: I'm lazy after work days and only order pizza or other unhealthy foods\n* Start working out. I'm still kinda skinny but also not got a little belly - I just can't get started\n* Open myself up to dating. Although I want to have a partner, I do think that I'm in the way of myself on this one.\n* Moved to a new city almost a year ago and have yet to make friends here while I'm intensively in touch with the ones at home.\n\nIt's so crazy as I see many people improving their lives and these are the major things that I simply can't push through. It's frustrating. I blame working a lot on it. I tend to think 'you can't have it all' or 'no one is perfect'.\n\nAnd somehow it's bizarre because I do have it much better than many people and I need to appreciate that more. I respect people so much who focus on a healthy living and diet with limited means or some who really have shit going on in their life and are still able to make a positive change.\n\nI have a loving family, good friends\n\nSo not really a question but maybe an outsider opinion is always good to hear. I wouldn't say I'm depressed in any way..just struggling to get out there with my personal goals.\n\nThanks!",

Example: apparently an 18 year old in my province (I'm Canadian) won the lottery, and rather than being like \"hey yeah good for her that's amazing\", the first thing that my brain jumped to was \"she's 18. what is she going to do with that money? i need it for x and x .....\" and so on.

        "text": " \n\nEveryone has a unique definition of discipline but one thing is certain: It's key to achieving any goal. Whether you're trying to gain weight, lose fat, build muscle or achieve peak performance, having the discipline to stay on track with your plan is essential. But what does it really mean to have discipline and how can one successfully make use of it? In this post, we'll explore what discipline is and how to best use it for maximum success!\n\nLet's start by defining discipline. Simply put, it's the ability to take deliberate actions towards a particular goal in order to achieve success. Discipline involves forming good habits that help you stay focused on your objectives and resist potential distractions (like unhealthy snacks or binge watching Netflix). It also means learning how to manage yourself effectively so that you can both short-term tasks as well as long-term goals.\n\nNow let's talk about how we can apply this principle of discipline in our lives. First off, start by setting realistic goals and creating a plan that will help you get there. Write down all the steps necessary for successful completion of each task and then break them down into manageable chunks that are achievable within a certain amount of time. This will provide you with an outline for accomplishing your goal while keeping distractions at bay.\n\nNext up is developing a consistent routine that helps keep you focused on your objectives. Prioritize tasks according to their importance and set daily milestones for yourself - this will give structure to your work day and make sure you’re always making progress towards your end result. Also adding incentives throughout your journey can be helpful - rewarding yourself when milestones have been achieved can motivate you even further!\n\nFinally, don't forget the importance of self-awareness when it comes to self-discipline - understanding yourself on a deeper level can help uncover areas which might need some work in terms of concentration levels or quality of work done. Once these points are identified, focus on working on them gradually until desired results are achieved.\n\nIn summary, having discipline and using it effectively is essential for reaching any goal - big or small! With dedication, commitment, and most importantly consistency; it should be possible for anyone to achieve their dreams through disciplined action! #Discipline #Motivation #Success #Urhealthiswealth",

I once used someone's hanging underwear which was put up for drying on terrace and put it inside my underwear to get a sexual kick and immediately regretted it. (No I did not masturbate to it, I put it inside my underwear, immediately regretted it and removed it).  \nTo give some context, it was the lockdown, my sleep schedule was not regular, my eating pattern was messed up (used to eat only 3 or 4 days once, that too fatty sugar heavy snacks) and I was addicted to porn too. I was in a really bad messed up state and couldn't think clearly. I also think I had a kink for panties back then cuz of all the uncontrolled access I had to porn. I'm not justifying anything, I'm only telling the context in which it happened if that makes any difference.  \nNever really thought about this incident in 2 years until now and it's haunting me. It's like I'm a totally different person now who's disgusted over his past self. Idk what to do. I'm feeling suicidal cuz I can't think of myself as any less than a rapist even though I haven't raped exactly but I did breach consent ig? What's different between me and a rapist? Both have basically breached the other person's consent. And no, I'm not trying to gain sympathy by blackmailing y'all with suicide. I genuinely regret what I did and it's killing me from inside. And I can't even apologize about this to anyone cuz idk who those panties belonged to. The suicidal feelings keep fluctuating. Sometimes I think I'm the worst for doing this and feel like dying, sometimes I think I'm wasting my time overthinking this. What should I do now?  \nAlso, should I ever tell this to my future partners or should I just let this pass as a random incident? Not telling it feels like I'm hiding something from them, but at the same time, idk how they will react if I tell them this cuz I definitely believe I'm a different person now and I don't wanna lose them over this incident which occurred in my past. I've quit watching porn few months ago too, but idk how they'll process all of this.",

So if you are starting to feel like the stakes are getting higher, just know that that is natural and not a bad sign necessarily.",

        "text": "I was neglected a lot as a kid and made to feel like a nuisance/burden, so I’ve got a lot of issues with not liking to trouble other people. It took me ages to stop being a pushover and a people pleaser, but now that I’ve stopped that I think I’m just completely unapproachable instead.\n\nI just don’t seem to make friends. I’m friendly and chat with neighbours and colleagues and acquaintances, but it never goes any further than that. I’ve asked for feedback from a few people that I’ve known for a long time and they all say the same thing, that I’m closed off or have a resting bitch face or I seem to just want to keep myself to myself. Tonight I broke up with a guy I’d been seeing for a few months (turns out there’s a messy situation with his ex that I’d rather not be a part of) and he mentioned that he always felt like I wasn’t interested in him anyway when actually I’d felt really loved up but hadn’t wanted to freak him out or come across as needy. My counsellor also comments on my being closed off a lot too, she says that I talk about my trauma very matter of factly and don’t like to appear weak or annoying.\n\nI don’t do any of this on purpose, I’m just being polite and not wanting to bore people or impose myself on them. I’m always polite and smiling and show concern when they mention their life problems and I occasionally suggest hanging out together, but I never complain or share any good news because I assume that people don’t want to hear me banging on about my life, to me there’s nothing worse than someone who won’t shut up about themselves and is oblivious to how much they’re boring others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny tips to work on this? I’m only aware I do it in retrospect, and I’m worried that if I go at it too aggressively I’m just going to end up completely over sharing and get myself into a big mess I can’t get out of.",

The only friend I had in high school broke off our relationship and sent me a long explanation about how inconsiderate I am as a person. According to her text, I never reciprocated any of her efforts when she invited me to outings, was flakey, showed little to no appreciation for her, was constantly critical of her and didn’t give compliments, only knew how to take from the others, etc. \n\nI took her harsh words to heart for 5 years. In spite of not being able to reconcile with her (she blocked me before I can apologize), I’m trying hard to put in effort to change how I approach my current relationships. Unfortunately I’m still failing to do things “correctly”.\n\nWhen a friend does something nice for me, I have a hard time not seeing it as them using the action to gain leverage over me. Everything ends up being transactional in my eyes, and this week I upsetted a friend when I insisted on paying them for a few thoughtful gifts they took days to craft for me. I really did think that I was doing the right thing by offering to pay for their time and materials, but instead I believe I deeply hurt their feelings by trying to reciprocate a hand crafted gift with money. I wasn’t able to tell that they’re upset until they straight up said so, I thought everything’s resolved when they agreed to accepting the payment. \n\nWhere do I even begin to learn proper social etiquette? How do I read people and can tell if someone is being genuinely nice? How do I approach this type of scenario in the future? When do I know to push my gratitude because the other party is being polite and wouldn’t accept reimbursement, and when do I pull back? I feel lost and confused over my friend’s reaction, and I have no idea where to go from here. This is just one of the many examples where I’m not able to read the situation correctly, and end up making things worse when from my perspective, I’m doing a “thoughtful” thing where I am not taking advantage of/am being helpful towards the others. 😞",

For example, with my ex who dumped me after 4 months, he had a untrained dog that was bothering me.

Now that I look back, I feel like I could've focused on it less, etc.\n\nAnother example is with my other ex, I was hung up on him texting a girl behind my back in the early stages of us dating which honestly led to our breakup throughout a year. I couldn't move on, and hyper focused on that issue for the whole year when I could've just moved on and live in the moment of him being with me. It's like I'm controlling or something I don't know.

Don't convince yourself that habits like video games, weed, and excessive internet use are productive or helpful. These activities will never contribute to reaching your objectives and can only be overcome if you acknowledge their negative impact. So, acknowledge your bad habits, and continue with the steps to achieve your desires in life.\n\nSometimes I'll have a conversation with a friend about one of their bad habits, such as playing League of Legends or smoking weed. Each of them will say that they can stop it anytime and that it's not an addiction and not bad for their mental health. However, you can only realize that you have poor mental health if you improve it. Let's say it's not bad for your mental health and it's normal, but you still can't deny that it's a waste of time. Spend just one hour on video games a day and we all know that it's more like 25 per week,\n\nbut let’s say imagine how much better you would feel if you put that extra 25 hours into growing a business or doing something productive in real life. And for those who say they need a break every now and then, I ask you to have respect for yourself. Are you really enjoying this habit? Think about how many keyboards you've broken when you get a NPC midlaner playing with yasuo or how many times you've gone home in a fit because you spent 300 dollars on weed for the third time this month. Later, we'll talk about real breaks that you can take, but for now, I want you to be fully present with me.

        "text": "Consistency is the one equal playing field anyone can get on to guarantee they reach whatever it is they want. And this isn't something hidden from the public. Everybody knows the power of consistency because they've experienced it.\n\nCase and point, you’ve experienced the power of consistency when you learned how to speak, walk or even read. You couldn’t do it, but you kept trying for days, weeks, months on end, until you could. Even if you don’t remember the process anymore.\n\nWe all know what consistency can do for us, no matter where we are. So how come we fail to use it on things that truly matter? On the things, we want more than anything?\n\nWhy are we inconsistent with the gym, growing that business, writing that book, or even dialing up our friends and family to maintain our relationships? It’s because even though consistency is a powerful force, most of us haven't learned how to use it.\n\nMost of the time, we don't aim for consistency when setting big goals we want to reach. We think we are, \"I'm gonna do this every day!\" But in reality, we aren't.\n\nTake my story for example.\n\nMy goal is to build a following on TikTok, and I set the goal to post 11 videos daily. I made a system for how I'd get the 11 TikToks in a way that wasn't too much of a stretch, and I followed that system. I spent about five hours a day shooting and editing videos. I didn't do it all at once, though. I'd spend a few hours batch-recording the preplanned videos and then sporadically spend 30 minutes to an hour throughout the day editing, and it worked. I was making 77 pieces of content in a week.\n\nI had to sacrifice some time and focus daily on content creation, but that was fine. I didn't mind doing it.\n\nAnd then I started posting.\n\nInitially, the feedback on Tiktok went well. My first few videos averaged around 300 views, and I got a few followers every few days. But after two weeks, my view count dropped to 3's, 2's, and 0's. I didn't get any followers. I felt discouraged, but I hyped myself up by saying, \"David Goggins would make TikTok his b\\*tch and keep posting.\"\n\n\"I gotta keep jab, jab, jabbing this thing!\"\n\n\"Gary Vee would be proud of all this content I'm pushing.\"\n\nAnd so I kept pushing out 11 pieces of content, spending a big chunk of my time creating it and fighting back doubts. But the doubt kept growing every time I posted, only to see 0 views. I started searching for answers online, going through Reddit, \"Why isn't my TikTok growing?\" discussions, watching YT videos on how to grow, and rewatching GaryVee's advice to post 100 pieces of content daily to feel motivated. But nothing worked, and to feel better about myself, I came to the wimpy conclusion that TikTok shadowbanned me for having too many TikTok accounts, and until I got a new phone and started a freshly new account, posting was futile. TikTok was halting my growth, and there was nothing I could do.\n\nNow, instead of turning my back on posting altogether on my TikTok page, I decided I'd continue because at least once I got my new phone for a fresh start, I'd have a ton of content stocked up to post. Plus, I wanted to practice making content; it was a fun way to pass the time. The only change I made was instead of creating and posting 11 TikToks a day since no one would see it, I'd post 6 a day for 42 videos a week.\n\nNow, getting 42 videos a week was laughable easy to me. Yes, it would still take some effort and time, but not nearly as much as before. And since I wasn't worried about growth anymore, I'd just post the videos whenever and not even think about it. And that's what I did.\n\nI hopped on the app, randomly posted, didn't care for the results, and moved on.\n\nOddly enough, after two days of doing this, I got 2 followers. And that's when I realized I'd been going about consistency wrong.\n\nIf you want to succeed and make progress, you have to plan for consistency in the long term, NOT the short term. Progress is extremely hard to get initially; it's not something you can rush with a steady stream of hard work IF that work discourages and burns you out within a month or two.\n\nConsistency can only work if you plan it for the long term with realistic expectations of the progress you'll make. And that's what I was doing wrong. I wasn't thinking, \"Can I realistically make 77 videos weekly? Even if I don't see progress?\"\n\nNo, I was thinking, \"The more content I post, the faster I'll grow. 11 pieces a day, it is!\"\n\nBut when I put in all that effort, only to see 0 views, I felt extremely discouraged and started doubting myself. What's the point in doing all of this for no views? It wasn't until I said forget this and lowered the effort I was putting in without any expectation of progress that I finally stepped into the realm of consistency.\n\nBecause now, I was just gonna show up, spend about 2 days batching 42 videos and then post them whenever throughout the day. And this was an easy process I could keep up for a very long time. Even more, I wouldn't get discouraged by my lack of progress because it's not like I was dedicating so much time and effort to this thing. I was just doing enough to stay afloat and keep my foot in the game. No progress? No sweat off my back.\n\nAt least I'm not giving too much for nothing. Now I'm just giving **something**.\n\nAnd that's what consistency is. It's just giving something.\n\nIf you can give something daily without caring about the results, you're building up to something extremely powerful in the background. The compound effect. And once the compound effect kicks in, the progress that'll come with it will be unbelievable.\n\nConsistency = Realistic Effort + Realistic Expectation\n\nIf you can determine a realistic amount of effort on your goals with realistic expectations of progress, you'll reach your goals because it'll be effortless for you to stay consistent for the long term.\n\nFor me, posting 11 pieces of content was an unrealistic amount of effort to sustain, with unrealistic expectations of how things would go. I thought I'd have 1000s of followers –- not 12. So after a month of posting and little growth that didn't match my unrealistic expectations, I began doubting myself and wanting to quit. But then I went through a period where I readjusted my experiences, and I thought, \"No worries. I'm gonna keep jabbing TikTok and get at least 2 followers a week. Then I'll start growing.\"\n\nThat still wasn't helping because I started getting frustrated/on the edge of burning out. After all, why was I giving so much time and effort for such a low, almost nonexistent return? Again, the idea of giving up was prominent because I was now putting in unrealistic effort for a realistic outcome.\n\nIt wasn't until I dropped the effort bar to something more realistic, 6 videos a day with the realistic expectation of slow growth, that the idea of quitting suddenly left my mind.\n\nAfter all, why quit when I was doing something that didn't take so much from me paired with the realistic timeframe of how long it would take to grow? Now notice how I didn't drop to the realistic effort of posting 1 video daily with the realistic expectation of slow growth.\n\nI could've easily done that, but I chose 6 because I like a challenge, and 6 is challenging enough to get without going over what's realistic for me. If you want to get what I'm saying. So whatever goal you have, plan for its consistency by setting a realistic amount of effort (something you can easily do every day) with a realistic expectation of what you'll get from it (9 times outta 10, slow progress).\n\nOtherwise, if it's unrealistic effort with realistic expectations, you'll get frustrated and wonder why you're working so hard for barely anything. If you set realistic effort with unrealistic expectations, you're going to get anxious and doubt yourself when you don't see any fast progress. And if you set unrealistic efforts and expectations, you'll burnout within the first 2 weeks, like I almost did. Don't do that to yourself.\n\nFollow the consistency formula and figure out a realistic amount of effort you can give to your goals, with a realistic expectation for what you’ll get. If you can do that, you’ll never struggle to stay consistent again.\n\nNow, remember, time is passing anyway. So you might as well start taking action, working on your goals right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Consistency = Realistic Effort + Realistic Expectation",

I realize that after having interacted quite some time with me, people will usually treat me like I'm a burden like I'm stupid and childish, and I'd usually blatantly get ignored. Few assholes will find this opportunity exaggerate certain things about me and to blame everything out to be my fault\n\nI can blame society for this but, thinking again, if many people do treat me like this, and I'm the common denominator, I'm partial if not mostly responsible for this at all.\n\nI think that even though I don't socialize much, when I do have much lower inhibition. I don't read the room quite well which can cause people to feel unconsciously irritated. Their interactions with me deals more with their tolerance then from genuine appraisal or sharing of value. This can be the root cause of why people might feel what they feel",

        "text": "I am a college senior who is about to graduate in May.\n\nI'm able to at least put my education as a priority and do my homework and go to class and such, but my own physical health has started lacking severely.\n\nIn high school, I started lifting weights and dieting. At my peak, I was 165 pounds of pure muscle , and somehow, one summer, I lost 20 pounds, and then, for a few years, I jumped around 145-155. This info isn't too relevant, I guess.\n\nAnyways, this past year, especially I've been lazy. I'll wake up, look at the weather and outside, and either say \"nope I'll work out later or just skip today.\" Or I'll wake up in the morning and just be like I'm too tired or complain and not want to work out. Granted, in the winter, when it says it's 10 degrees but feels like -5, it's hard to get motivated to walk 10 minutes to the gym. \n\nEither way, I'll wake up at 5-530 AM, and make a lame excuse not to go to the gym, then just scroll on my phone for 2-3 hours until I have to go to work or class. Once I get home, or I'm waiting in between classes, I'll get homework done. Once all that's done, it's back to me either just laying on my bed scrolling or I'll play video games. Even doing homework is hard sometimes if I'm home, as I'll just want to scroll through my phone. \n\nI don't like going later in the day as most days I'm not done with classes until 430-5, and when I go, then the gym is just way too busy and crowded so it's hard and annoying to get my workout in.\n\nBefore, I was so dedicated and ready to go to the gym, even if I was incredibly tired, or even if it felt like -20, I'd go to the gym (I may complain profusely about the cold whilst walking but I'd still go). But this past year has been so difficult for me, I wake up, make a lame excuse, and end up never going that day. I used to go 5-6 times a week, and now I'm happy if I'm able to get myself to go 3 times a week! It's been like this for the past few months to a year, especially.",

        "text": " I finally decided to take an action on my phone addiction last night but this time I took a different approach. \n\n1-I properly and seriously monitored /thought about how i am using my phone.  I think phone addiction shows difference in each person's behaviour. \n\n2- Not having social media account doesn't serve me, I am in fashion industry and I love following social media. However I don't mind doing this on laptop for few hours a day but with my phone it is ridiculously toxic and draining.  I do spend a lot of time on Instagram but what is worse for me is keep checking my phone frequently. Like checking my gmail all the time (not work email if you noticed) even social update emails.. Or I am checking an app i never use but i am checking to read whatever notification is sent. I am keep getting in shopping apps, and reading notifications on my phone. Basically I am not even spending good time while i am already wasting time on my phone. \n\n3- Mostly importantly my self esteem is so low about this behaviour. When I think of it I am over 30 years old behaving and killing my time like a teenager. Is this how I am gong to live my life? I am living teenager life. Seriously I am done with this way of being. \n\nOkay, now what I thought. What did I do?\n\nI deleted ALL apps from my phone last night. Only left functional ones like my gym, banking, calendar.  I want to use my phone smartly and effectively, and I love the comfort technology bring in to my life. I am an organized person who follow personal agenda etc. So my phone can play role of personal agenda and it would make me really happy as first step on this journey.   \n As I am living abroad I also left WhatsApp but muted message notifications. Calls are not muted.\n\nI did these last night and left my phone on my desk, and went to sleep. As I wake up I had a massive urge to check my phone, get in social media etc. However I managed to start my day without it and basically ended up getting on my daily chores directly. There was nothing to kill time. After a while, before I have my lunch I checked my emails and replied them. Had my lunch and now I wanted to come to Reddit to share this, I will have little browsing session then I will do some work on my laptop. \n\nMy phone will be staying as phone on the side, whatsapp talks? I dont mind them at all as I am an expat and far away from everybody. But these apps and checking business, I am out! Wish me luck! and share your thoughts. \n\nOne of the most important realization; being on browsing mode on laptop doesn't mess with me as phone does. I wonder why? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, thought to share it maybe it can inspire some of us here.",

        "text": "Life  can be overwhelming, so it is important to take the time to focus on  the basics. Doing this can help you feel in control, organized, and able  to make the most of your time. Here's how to optimize sleep,\n\n\\*I Benefits of sleep:\\*\n\nIt  may seem obvious that sleep is beneficial. Even without fully grasping  what sleep does for us, we know that going without sleep for too long  makes us feel terrible, and that getting a good night's sleep can make  us feel ready to take on the world.\n\nScientists  have gone to great lengths to fully understand sleep's benefits. In  studies of humans and other animals, they have discovered that sleep  plays a critical role in immune function, metabolism, memory, learning,  and other vital functions.\n\nNow  normally I would include some research showing the immense benefits of  sleep on fitness, inteligence and such.. but this subreddit doesn't  allow even the MENTION of the alternative word of \"URL\", so I can't really do much.\n\n\\*II Better Sleep\\*\n\nFollow these tips to establish healthy sleep habits:\n\nKeep a consistent sleep schedule. Get up at the same time every day, even on weekends or during vacations.\n\nIf  you don’t fall asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed. Go do a quiet  activity without a lot of light exposure. It is especially important to  not get on electronics\n\nEstablish a  relaxing bedtime routine. (When you are relaxed and about to go to  sleep and your brain actually releases melationin.. and then you play  videogames or check a text.. you're basically telling your brain \"BE  ACTIVE!\" And then getting mad at it for being active..)\n\nTurn off electronic devices at least 30 minutes before bedtime.\n\nThe  secret is to have good sleep hygiene and to be relaxed before sleeping,  but not with the intention to sleep just with the intention to be  relaxed, because if you don't want to increase sleep anxiety and to do  things because you want to sleep, this is what insomniacs do and it  doesn't work, You have to do this with the intention of having a  relaxing, night routine. and that's all :) You could meditate before  sleep and read a relaxing book or recite a scripture, Or take a warm  bath, these are all very valid and very good ideas and habits to do  before sleep, Not everyone needs the same amount of sleep but it's a  good idea if you're under 18 to use the reccomended sleep time for your  age, Also it's a good idea to setup your sleep schedule at a time where  you feel sleepy, so that you only go to bed when you are sleepy, a  common scenario that occurs with insomnia and how someone might end up  going to bed when they don't feel sleepy, you cannot force yourself to  sleep but by establishing a good sleep hygiene and routine you will feel  sleepier earlier :)",

I\\*\n\nYou have probably heard and seen the same narrative with nofap millions of times, you have probably seen youtubers shirtless recording videos about.. Benefits of nofap! The nofap timeline! How to succed at nofap! And you might've also noticed how every month one of those nofap gurus uploads a video titled \"I relapsed.\" that gets milions of views. You've probably already heard of the countless benefits of leaving pornography. and such, but do not be fooled by decievers and such, for pornography doesn't have any benefits to leaving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt merely only removes negatives.\n\nWhen someone has been jailed, do we believe that the person gained the benefit of being free, because leaving jail has that benefit? no, leaving jail was only an end of a negative.\n\n    &gt; Negative effects span from low energy, low motivation, lessened ability to do work, lowered respect for women, depression, anxiety when interacting with others, porn-induced erectile dysfunction, relationship problems, acne, lowered testosterone (indirect), obsession with porn and fantasies, questioning sexuality despite no previous interest, and more. Many people believe nofap provides benefits, but it is actually just the negatives of fapping itself being removed.\n\nSo, knowing this you search up on youtube or the like, and you find videos of millons of views from people that are \"reputable\" in the nofap community, they will tell you how much porn harms you, and tell you to do something requiring motivation of the such and willpower, for example : Porn lowers your testosterone, so resist it and fight the urges! or: Think about the things you will miss! Most of this advice, is not going to help you but is going to keep you trapped, so they can make more money off you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHabits can be broken with motivation and intrinsic value, but addiction should be approached differently.\n\n    &gt; When you want to start something, often motivation is a good starting point, but motivation never leads to consistency. Nearly all popular advice uses motivation as the basis, which leads to the user having an incentive that quickly disappears, leading them right back into the trap. Sustainability comes from a genuine desire and intrinsic motivation to improve yourself. Therefore, motivation should not be used as a basis for leaving.\n\n\\*What should I do then? II\\*\n\nSeek freedom, to seek freedom, You must seek truth, as freedom only comes from truth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnderstand the addiction and yourself, understand your emotions and your abilities, understand the brainwash that the porn industry is inflicting on poor non-users such as yourself, then have full and geniune desire, belief, faith, and control. and you will be able to achieve freedom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDesire, A burning sincere desire to seek truth and be free.\n\nBelief, Belief that you will be able to seek out whatever you desire.\n\nFaith, Faith that you will succed.\n\nControl, Control over your brain and emotions.\n\nWe're going to read burgeon, Search on google \"Burgeon Book\" and you will find it  It's an excellent book to remove the brainwash and introduce you into this new path of quitting,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome people fail to rid themselves of porn &amp; masturbation, due to misunderstandings.  Burgeon is not a instruction book,  Burgeon is not a How-To, Burgeon Is a book that wants you to seek truth about this addiction, and you will seek truth and you will be free.  Burgeon talks about the benefits of porn, and why they wont help you quit, about total and complete ownership of your problems to fix them, about the burning desire to succed, about human nature and love, about brain science, neural pathways, neurology and Neuroplasticity, which is the  ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganization. It is when the brain is rewired to function in some way that differs from how it previously functioned, the main topic in the book, about the brainwashing that you might've recieved from influencers, the porn industry, nofap community, and \\*\\*yourself.\\*\\*, It talks about transmutation and moving on after you have became free, and last of all and most important of all\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFreedom.\\*\\* Some rules for succeeding. IV\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Do not advice anyone to do something you do not understand, we are bretheren and we want to guide eachother, not misguide eachother.\n2. Go in with full belief and faith in yourself, forget every other time you tried.\n3. Sometimes the book will feel like it's rambling, but don't worry, I promise you that you will get what you wanted, the book IS short, but it will give you the information you need. All the information said in the book IS needed to undo the brainwash, so do not worry, have patience my friend :)\n\nI also have this guide in video-form, I'll post it in the comments",

My girlfriend has become extremely confident that I’m autistic, and I’m waiting for an upcoming psychiatrist appointment to get a proper diagnosis, (something I’m struggling to come to terms to) so maybe I just don’t understand because of that?\n\nThere’s been a lot on my mind, various triggers I suppose is best not to mention, and I have a psychiatrist who’s prescribing me with an antidepressant and a new antianxiety on top of it. I was able to tell her what I was feeling. I was telling my therapist too, I thought we were making progress.\n\nMy therapist told me my homework for this week would be to think about if I’m ready for therapy and what I’m willing to do for it. It scares me. I’m panicking at the thought of not being able to have a therapist, especially after my last one has ghosted me, and the possibility that my psychiatrist or insurance might strip me of my meds if I don’t have one. I don’t understand what it means to be ready for therapy, and I don’t understand how or why I wouldn’t be. I feel lost and confused, and really scared.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I’m terrified. Has anybody been in this position before? How do you be ready for therapy? How does she know I’m not ready when I myself thought I was ready? What do I do without a therapist? What’s going to happen to me?",

Later I asked her out on snap and she said she was busy to hang out that particular day , I asked her again later and she said she would get back to me but didn't. I brushed it off and this time I was taking a group fitness class a week later and smiled + made eye contact with this girl, we chatted for a bit and she seemed very receptive, she asked my name and where I was from and genuinely seemed enthusiastic. I asked her if she wants to grab coffee sometime and she said she'll let me know after checking her schedule so I grabbed her snap and texted her later that night to set up a time and date later in the week. It's been 2 days and I've been left on delivered. I know it's only 2 girls but it genuinely sucks considering it takes so much to approach someone and not even get a reply or proper no, I've never been in a relationship before but have hooked up a few times with randoms but that wasn't what I was looking for tbh and now to get hit wit this just hurts alot and makes me want to just give up on dating because it hits your self esteem so hard. I'm decently attractive at 6ft + I workout alot and take care of myself and am in university studying Business but it doesn't seem to be enough no matter what. Any advice?",

I want to be confident and like social with my new coworkers but something is jsut stopping me. \n\nMy mind really just fully like shuts down. I struggle hearing what they say cuz im overthinking it all, I speak very quietly so I have to repeat myself 2-3 times, I cant have any conversation other than essentially short yes no answers...\n\nThe 2nd problem is that my body also goes all stupid. Like I lose all coordination, I become shakey and overly tense, I get physically awkward and all that.\n\nIts just so annoying. Its not that I dont want to be social, and I dont think its that I dont understand the cues or standards, its literally like I just start overthinking and I take all the natural and automatic aspects of social-ness and force them to all be manual and then I struggle keeping up. \n\nPart of me is paranoid thinking I might even have autism or something since I know that causes social issues, but I was never diagnosed nor was it really ever brought up. I've asked multiple people close to me out of paranoia and they all said no autism, although possible adhd or mood disorders...\n\nI really think its a confidence issue at the root of it all but I dont know how to fix it. I dont have these issues when interacting with an environment I feel comfortable in and around people I feel comfortable with, but its the new environment and people that make me feel like I have to prove my competence and that causes this ultra competitive, hyper focused, manual overdrive mania shit.",

And sometimes I am reminded of it. For example: When I come home after long days and my mom doesn't ask how my day is or sees no interest in the things I am doing and working on, I am reminded of my when I was younger and would try to get her attention and have her listen to me. Then, she'll often bicker or complain or just tell me what I am doing wrong. I only get upset when I think about it. I told her about a competition I was doing and the only thing that concerned her was if she needed to drive me or not.\n\nI find that spending weekends at home is what makes me the most emotional and I think it is because of that but I don't know how to deal with it and I don't even know if I should. Because like I said, I am fine when I am distracted in my everyday life. But I've heard some buzz about working with your shadows, which a lot do root from childhood.\n\nThe day when I am done college, and hopefully can afford my own place, and hopefully my own car soon is when I think I will finally be free of this shit.\n\nI am not sure if this post makes sense.

They learn and grow and improve obsessively.\n* Successful people refuse to whine when things don’t go their way. They figure out a way to win in spite of setbacks.\n* Successful people refuse to copy what other people have done to be successful. They ignore the crowd and do their own thing.\n* Successful people refuse to stay down when they get knocked down or fail. They pull themselves together and come back stronger.\n* Successful people refuse to avoid doing the hard work that success demands. They sweat, fight, and bleed for their cause.\n* Successful people refuse to adopt the thinking of the status quo. They do their own research and always think for themselves.\n* Successful people refuse to ignore their own weaknesses and bad habits. They take steps to fix and improve them.\n* Successful people refuse to pretend that they are perfect or better than anyone else. They are focused maniacally on improving.\n* Successful people refuse to look down on others around them who aren’t winners yet. They encourage them to achieve more.\n* Successful people refuse to overlook the details that drive better results. They are deliberate about being better – even when that hurts.\n* Successful people refuse to be discouraged that people around them aren’t cheerleading for them.

They maniacally prioritize how they expend their energy.\n* Successful people refuse to try to be good at everything at the same time. They focus on doing one thing awesomely at a time.\n* Successful people refuse to give up when things get tough. They endure the tough times, innovate past obstacles, and keep trying.\n* Successful people refuse to listen to the doubters, critics, or skeptics. They stay focused and mentally disciplined\n* Successful people refuse to let anything stop them from following up and following through on what they promise.

For the last few years, I’ve realized that there was this “ All men are X and Y”  mouvement and saying “not all men are like this tho” is considered to be an insult. I used to be that type of person and just decided to stop saying this because it was considered immature and mean, but always had that small uncomfortable feeling. If someone ever said “All women are X and Y” it would create a major problem and you would be called a sexist.\n\nI don’t know how to explain this feeling… i just feel like men are seen as monsters? You could bring up the fact that men are x3.8 most likely to drink than women, fail in school, become homeless, suicide, go to prison, etc. But the answer I’ve gotten is “okay but men are doing that to themselves”. Okay yes, but does that mean that we should be putting men in corners with the label “we’re animals and monsters. Everything is our fault”? That feels absurd imo.\n\nAs someone who had 2 gfs cheating on me, where one cheated the same day of my grand father’s funeral and a mother that physically and emotionally abused my dad. I truly don’t understand why men get no help whatsoever and are seen as monsters. I’ve rarely got any help. Yes, I’ve seen therapists for other problems and apparently not a lot of men get mental help, which should be promoted because humans need help. We’re not super beings.\n\nI usually don’t care a lot about things like this, but I seem to be stressed and negative mentally lately after seeing story posts online of people saying “Men, stop harming us”, “men, stop raping us”, etc.\n\nI wanna delete social media because I can’t take this anymore. I’m tired of feeling extremely bad for being a man. Is this a normal behaviour? Social media as always been negative in a way.",
