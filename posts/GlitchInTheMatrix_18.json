        "text": "This happens to me kind of regularly. I will be sitting on the couch or laying in bed watching TV when I grab for the remote only to find that it is not where I know I set it last.... Sometimes only seconds ago. I will go as far as, if I am laying in bed, I will first check the ground around the bed to see if maybe it fell off. Next, I will remove all the pillows and fan all the blankets in the air incase the remote got wrapped up in them, once I know I have checked the bed completely I will replace the pillows and and climb back to my spot in bed defeated and confused about the location of the remote, only to reach my hand back to where I know I always leave the remote and there it is.  The same goes for when I'm watching TV on the couch, but for some reason the remote always ends up in different places. Like I know I have changed the channel or the volume with the remote since the last time I went to the kitchen, even in some cases, like in bed, maybe a few seconds prior.  I grab for the remote and it's gone. I get up, check all the cushions and the ground around and under the couch but nothing. Confused I walk into the kitchen and there it is, sitting on the edge of the counter as if I had set it there to remember it on the way out of the kitchen.   I have always wondered if I was the only one who has experienced this type of thing.",

        "text": "One time, I was flying in back home from a family trip, and my best friend picked me up from the airport. He’s an amazing driver, especially for his age (we were both 17 at the time) I trust him totally in the car, so instead of watching the road I was watching the view of being home again, finally! I looked to the right- out my passenger window and see a plane landing, but the airport and runway are to my left. The only thing to my right is parking lots and rental car places and motels. I think, this plane is too close, and then it stopped. I said omg look at that plane it looks like it’s hovering. My friend looked away from the road and looked at the plane I pointed at for a good 5 seconds -longer than I would have driving in the city by the airport. He says holy shit it does, huh. But he obviously can’t stop, so it leaves our view and I look behind us and it’s gone. Later my friend says it was probably just a trick of the light since we were driving pretty fast and it is landing slowly maybe it seemed to have hovered for a couple seconds? Seems to qualify as a glitch by idk for sure. ",

Today I experienced a glitch in the matrix. \n\nThis evening I was on the phone with my mother and my little brother talking about random things and what not. Yesterday my mother told me not to forget to send my godfather a happy birthday textmessage. While I was talking to my little brother on the phone my mother asked me if I send the message already. I said I didn't and will do it in a bit. After I ended the phone call I went on correcting my little brother his homework assignment as it was around 9.45 pm. I finished on exactly 10.02 pm (I checked as this was the time I send it to him by email). I still had to read a paper though I was debating if I should take a shower first, so I glanced at the time on my computer. It was 10.04 pm as I decided to keep reading the paper for half an hour and take a shower then. My boyfriend was sitting next to me as I was complaining about how difficult the paper was to comprehend. I clearly remember just thinking I must put my mind to it for at least half an hour before I would stop, and so I did.\n\nSuddenly I remembered I still had to send the happy birthday text to my godfather as I glanced at the time, it was  10.44 pm. So I reached out to grab my phone and went to the text message app and was looking for my godfathers name between my messages. As I found his name and opened the messages, I saw a birthday message I had sent on 10.43 pm.. I thought maybe this was a message I sent last year, but it wasn't. It clearly said \"Hey Godfather, my mother told me today was your birthday, I know its late but I still wanted to wish you a happy birthday. I wish you lots of love, health and all the best in the world\". I still cannot believe what just happend. I certainly cannot remember typing this message as I usually have to think about what I put in a birthday message as I want to make it more than just saying \"happy birthday\". \n\nOn top of that, I have to write it in Russian (I and my godfather are both Russian) so I have take the time to think and write it. I clearly remember thinking that I had to write the message as I saw it was already 10.44 pm. I just cannot remember ever doing it, especially knowing I need to take time to think about what to write in such a message. My boyfriend was sitting next to me and didn't see me writing it and is just as freaked out as I am..  \n\nI really don't know what to think and it is really freaking me out.. If you ever had a similar experience please let me know. ",

She put them under her keys in a bag with some everything bagels to bring home, so that she couldn't possibly forget them. At the end of her shift after grabbing her keys and bag of baked goods, she was halfway home and realized \"Oh shit! Forgot my brownies...\" She checked in the bagel bag and on the seat of the car but they weren't there. Got home, put the bagels in the fridge, and carried on. Went back the next day for the brownies and they weren't there at work. \n\nA couple of days after seemingly having forgotten/misplaced the brownies, she was in the mood for something sweet and her boyfriend said he knew just the thing. He walked over to the fridge, grabbed a paper package in there that contained the brownies, and tried to give them to her-- of course she spent about ten minutes freaking out rather than eating them. Basically it's as if the brownies teleported to the fridge, or disappeared in the car and then reappeared in the fridge later. They only make these brownies on that specific day, so it's not like she could have misremembered the timing or anything. She also looked for them the day after forgetting them and before their reappearance, and they weren't there. Weird glitch, but at least she got them back...?",

Still ended up being late. But seriously how could time have jumped. Before anyone says I looked at the time wrong 1. It was bright at 11 but dark at 6:54 and 2. When I sleep to long my eyelahes stick together and that happen today even though I went to bed at midnight so would only of had 6 hours sleep not the 10 I need for my eyelahes to stick. This is creepy. This changes a lot of things because I had to talk to someone about something important and that couldn't of happened if I didn't get up till 11:00, person would have left by the time i got there. Another big change is now that I have jetlag now. Never heard of someone getting jatlag from a time glitch before. I guess unlike how the title puts it I wasn't helped then if I have that annoying jetlag. So my sleep will be fucked for a few days because the matrix glitched. I am editing this because I want to talk more about the changes and yes the eyelahes thing is strange.  So yeah I may have screwed up. I got up earlier big change I went to bed later small change.  Anyone ever time glitched. If you have can you tell me what happens next. I am confused and thouth that today I would have jumped forward 4 hours to make up the different but  I haven't. Am I stuck 4 hours 6 minutes behind where* I should be. Will I jump today tomorrow 5 days 4 weeks 6 years. I really don't know how these things work. I just noone truely knows everything but I'd really like some tips. If you think I am a mental person I am not. Ok I'm not normal don't fit in but I am not dangerous.  The man from tured makes me feel better\n\n\n\n\n* when I should be time travel joke",

I remember, very specifically glancing off to the right, careful not to look around for fear of seeing a monster or something. Instead I saw a long row of urinals, more than I could count. I was confused and amazed at how big the bathroom really was, and thought maybe it's just a mirror reflecting the urinals to appear to be more than there really was. The next time I used the bathroom, I counted only 5 urinals, and no mirror. To this day I have no clue what I saw. ",

        "text": "Ok, first time ever posting but after doing a lot of research and watching many YouTube videos on this topic, I have come to the conclusion that I have experienced a lot of moments in my life that I would like to classify as “glitches”. The first one ever happening to me at a young age was definitely one of the more freaky ones.\nWhen I was about four, my mom had bought the original Charlie and the chocolate factory on DVD and me and my siblings used to watch it on repeat all the time. It was a great movie as a lot of people know, and me being the oldest of my brothers and sisters used to put it on for us all the time. So i knew the DVD well. It was purple, with Willy Wonka posing and smiling on it. It had the title of the movie on it and everything. It looked like it should. \nThere was a time when i was home alone (yes home alone. I was very mature when i was four and my parents worked a lot. My siblings were away with my grandma at the time) and decided to put the movie on. I put the DVD in and watched the movie all the way through, and when I was ready to put a different movie on, I opened the DVD player and saw that the cover for the movie had COMPLETELY changed. \nIt was now orange, with just a huge Willy Wonka face smiling and the title of the movie was a different color as well. Now being four, I WAS VERY FREAKED OUT. My little barely developed mind could not comprehend how this could have happened. How could the disc change in only an hour in watching the movie. I was scared, so I hid the disc under my moms bed and never watched the movie ever again. No one asked about it either for some reason. I try not to think about this since it still freaks me out to this day. I have looked up if the old DVDs for that movie changed or if there was a scratch off design under neath or something but I have gotten nothing. I have told a couple people about this but of course no one believes me or no one can explain it. but I guess I can classify it as a glitch now lol",

I'm just washing my hands and I'm about to grab a paper towel when my friend turns to me and says, \"I have some bad news...\". Then, without missing a beat, I say exactly what the bad news it.

Friend looks a little shocked and says, \"how did you know that's what I was going to say??\". Even at the time I just chalked it up to a lucky guess, but it's weird because it wasn't the kind of thing I could have guessed, like it wasn't something we had been discussing or anything. I don't know if this is really a glitch in the matrix or just a really lucky guess, but I'm just wondering if there's a word to describe this phenomenon? I'd love to know I'm not the only person this has happened to because I always found it really weird",

Before we drove I sat down on the couch with my mum and asked what day it was so I could calculate how many days where left in Christmas break and it was around maybe 15. I distinctly remember say \n“I wish I could have 10 more days of break”\n\n(Time skip)\n\n        So after driving and having festivities at California I was walking out the door before my aunt hugged me and asked me to wish for something because “Santa” was outside the door and would give me anything I desire. So I remember that convo with my mum and I blurted out\n“I wish for ten more days of break”\nMy aunt giggled and said okay and I was out the door like that ready to be driven all the way home\n\nI remember going in the car then waking up in my bed: but not falling asleep in the car which would’ve been normal cause this has happened before\n\nI ran down the hall to my mum making breakfast and I asked what day it was”\nShe had said it was the 17th of December. Then throughout the day I was quiet and I knew everything that was going to happen.\n\nNow to skip to the party again cause I had to relive that too my aunt asked me the same question and also asked why I had been so quiet. I said I was tired and I wished for the best Christmas ever.\nI went in the car and again woke up in my bed again.\nI ran down the hall and saw it was around two am and saw myself in like third person. I looked at the presents and I just went back to bed at this point I was too weirded out.\n\nIn the morning I awoke to a giant flat screen tv (at the time) a popcorn machine, a huge toy train set that could go around the house. And a lot more stuff but that’s just what I remember. Even as a kid I knew this was weird because I had some concept of how money worked and I knew my mum couldn’t afford this. (She’s the only one with a job) but I just assumed they just saved up. \n\nWeirdly enough though most of the presents started ‘disappearing’ in ways that seemed integrated into to normal life. My dad just gave away the tv for no normal reason and to which he wouldn’t normally do cause he’s a hoarding type of personality. The train set go thrown away? Like idk either. I still have the popcorn machine but anyone in my family refuses to use it. Lastly the other toys from that Christmas are gone too. Not to mention no one has even mentioned that Christmas either.",

        "text": "Ever since I was little I had a unique and out-of-ordinary life story that sometimes I still question what I saw and if it was ‘real’ amongst other things. I’ve been foolish during young adult years to compensate for any lack of fun during my high school years. Mistakes were made and lessons were learned and as the next chapter is being written I have found myself being interested in the world itself and how it works rather than myself. It would seem like we operate in systems that can be both man-made or computer generated? \n\nGlitches in my perspective can be anything from intense feelings that do not make sense to hallucinations without reason amongst other oddities. Spells and curses are another thought I have noticed that could be both useful and dangerous depending on how it’s applied and when it’s stopped. Although I have read some articles and have interests within Paganism and Wiccan I have not yet reached out or prepared myself to practice under guidance of experienced individuals.\n\nThe reason that I am writing this is because I have noticed many of these ‘glitches’ within my current matrix and I am wondering what I could do to patch or further pursue these glitches - possibility finding something that could be unique or secret? I know that writing can be a useful tool to gain more control of your mind along with other memory-based activities. ",

I don't even want to get married, as a young girl, other girls and even my relatives thought it was bizarre how I didnt fantasize about a \"perfect wedding/dress/groom etc.\" \nI brushed it off and went to work and throughout the day I'd interrupt my work with a sudden oh shit thought about how I forgot my ring. It went on for months. Several times a day until july I'd get panicked for a second because I felt I lost my engagement ring.\nThen today, I realized I haven't thought about the ring or the weirdness of it, at all.\nI completely forgot this 6 month period of anxiety over a nonexistent ring even occured. I can't explain why I'm remembering it now of all times. How did I not even notice that a tiny anxiety attack several times a day for 6 months ended? It still freaks me out, but it makes me wonder if there is an alternate universe me that was engaged and stressed out about it.",

I have always been OCD about time and days, especially where jobs are concerned.  An Aldi’s opened up in South NJ where I lived. They welcomed people to coming in, fill out an application, and be interviewed on the spot. They asked us to come early in the morning (let’s say 7AM) on a Thursday.  I counted down the days being super certain that I would get there early, and dress to impress.  Wednesday night, I laid my clothes out, checked my calendar before sleeping to make sure, and set my alarm.\nI arrived earlier than 7, and watched as many people parked in the lot and waited for the doors to open. An hour and a half passes, and someone walks about of the doors and tells us to go home because they aren’t opened yet, and that the “hiring will be done on Thursday, tomorrow.” We all looked at each other, and started to argue with the person that TODAY was Thursday. I looked at my phone, and mother fucking somehow it was Wednesday again. No one fucking spoke a word after realizing it was WEDNESDAY AGAIN, and everyone left.

So i adjusted the mirror so i could focus less on the 2 suns his headlights were pouring into my eyes.  a few min later ive stoped noticing them as much as i can focus better on the road when a car, the other way, passes me going south as i was going north. not a truck just a normal car with normal headlights.\n\nthey put their bright on then off as if to tell me to turn my brights off or upcoming speedtrap. So i look and they are not on. i figure it must be the truck behind me so i glance over to make sure and the fucker is gone.\ni adjust my mirror to get a better look and there is nothing at all behind me what so ever, at least 4 or 5 miles behind me. no lights any further behind noone passed me, and the next turn about a mile away. this is not a road you can u turn on with out worrying a car will smash you as its on and off busy at all times of day and night with sporadic drivers going 10+ over the speed limit of 40 mph.  my dashcam saw that i had bright lights behind me but not enough detail beyond that. they kind of fade away after i adjust the mirror till its not really noticable\n\nTldr: cars despawn and most people dont notice it because most people dont track every car around them as they drive as i do. most of the time its logical, some are not.\n",

        "text": "Never posted on here before, but have been reading a lot of the glitch posts and thought maybe someone would enjoy this, or have a similar experience. At my old job I used to do a lot of reading when there was down time. One shift I was sitting at the tables reading the first book in a four book series. I'm about 200 pages in and I notice there's about 15 pages missing randomly, kind of irritating but nothing life shattering just chalked it up to a misprint and kept trucking along. However, I did mention it to my coworkers, explained there were 15 pages missing and it was rip off. A few weeks later I was reading the 3rd book in the series, about 200 pages in, and I turn the page and the same exact paragraph I had read a few weeks ago was on the page. I did a double take, still the same, did a triple take, still the same paragraph...word for word. I flipped the page back and that was fine, flipped to the \"glitched\" page and it was still that same paragraph from the first book where the pages were missing, but there were no pages missing from this one and yet somehow the same paragraph ended up on that page; all the other paragraphs on the page were clearly supposed to be there, it was just that one I'd already read in the first book. I again said something to my coworkers, who happened to be the same two people I had been working with on the same shift I had been on a few weeks prior, the one even said \"Really? Again? Those books are fucked up\" so I know that really had happened a few weeks before. The weird(er) part is, later that night when I got home I got back into the book and flipped to the page that had been messed up earlier, and that paragraph was no longer there, the page read the way it was supposed to. Page numbers were all the same, the paragraphs before and after that one were the same but the paragraph from the first book wasn't there anymore...and I know I saw it. I read it three times actually. That was the only time I ever remember experiencing anything like that, still makes me scratch my head.",

        "text": "I know this might not be the right fit, but I have to tell you, ever since I've been recounting my experiences, the easier it has been for me to deal with reality and the memories.\n\nI made a temporary account just in case my experience here receives too much backlash and I can then just flush it away with the memories.\n\n---\n\nThis was about 20 years ago (I'm finally purging all the memories I have, and the more I do the more I remember).  I was sleeping in my bedroom that I had growing up.  The way the bed was positioned, I would see the light from under the bedroom door which directly lead to the dining room.  We had a long wooden table that could sit 6-8 but there were only 3 of us in the house.  \n\nThe routine was always the same.  I would go to bed, my mom would watch tv in the room she shared with my dad, and my dad would go and pour himself a drink and watch movies in the dark in the living room and I could see the glow of the tv leak under the bedroom door between the carpet threads.  I could also see my dad's shadow pass back and forth as he walked to the kitchen to replenish his drink.  This was a nightly occurrence that had happened for years and years.  \n\nOne night, the dining room light was turned on while I was laying in bed, and this wasn't an out of the ordinary occurrence.  The unused side of the kitchen table often held bills, old newspapers, and miscellaneous \"important\" items.  Dad, or mom, would briefly turn on the light get the item and then back off with the light.  If it was on for more than 2 minutes, it was a rarity.  One time there was a big stumble and the chair knocked over and my dad was so drunk he hit his head and practically passed out on the floor.  I had to get mom to help him to bed.  So this night, when the light went on and did not turn off, I was preparing to find dad, drunk again.  \n\nAt first, I didn't pay any attention until I saw swift shadows from under the door walking by... I was really confused.  There had to be at least 3-4 people in the house to account for the amount of light disturbance.  My dad, mom, me, that's all that was in the house.  I ran through the possible people who could have been over at that hour... my parents had few friends and fewer people who would visit unannounced especially at that hour.  \n\nSo I jumped out of bed to see wtf was going on. \n\nI opened the door to find my dad laying on our long dining room table, in his underwear, and surrounded by what I now have come to learn are the Grays.  Thinking back, I can count at least 7.  They couldn't have been more than 4 feet tall, and I think they were clothed, but in a utilitarian fashion.  \n\nMy dad was passed out, and the Grays on the side where we kept the pile of papers was focused on my dad but when \"it\" saw me, communicated to the other to deal with me.  There were no words exchanged, but just about all the other Grays faced me in unison and the one closest to me walked toward me.  \nI'm shitting balls. I'm in shock. I don't know what to do!  As the Gray walks toward me I remember flailing, not wanting to hurt it in fear of it killing me, and yet trying to keep it away.  I managed to shove it's head... \n\nand that's where it ends.  I wake up.  Race to see my parents who are already awake for the day... and I can't remember much more.  I had daymares, hallucinating the sound of rocketship torch jet engine noises.  But I don't remember much more...\n\nA few years later, my dad came down with stage 4 lymphoma and quickly died.  \n\nI've never told anyone this until today.  Thank you for listening. AMA.",

So I was sitting at the crosslight before the freeway waiting for my light to turn green and was watching the on ramp and the cars that entered it. Only one vehicle took the onramp, a large pepsi truck, which took the on ramp and disappeared from view. About 30-45 seconds later my light changed and I was able to drive over to the on ramp, at which point I saw all of the cars stopped. \"Damn\", I thought \"It's gridlocked\". But then in front of me was the pepsi truck, just sitting on the on ramp, completely stationary. I looked at the gridlock and noticed that after a point it was fully, completely clear and unobstructed road. There were no cars moving between the perfect line all of these cars made, all the way up to the next on ramp, where I could see traffic flowing like normal. I kept driving, and right as I got next to the pepsi truck, like on cue all the cars just started moving again. I thought it was extremely weird, and used the opportunity to get in front of literally all the traffic, so my drive was nice and short. But it was very weird to see all of the highway traffic at a standstill for literally no reason. ",

        "text": "I am going to try my best to articulate this story appropriately. Feel free to let me know if anything is unclear.\n\nSo I live in quite a sprawling city. On the eastern edge of town, there are two highways that run north-south that are about parallel to one another. One is about 25 miles in length, and is the busier road of the two. The other is about 15 miles long (it eventually merges with the 25 mile road), and is much less busy, and farther out east (not as close to developments).\n\nIt was the fourth of July of this year, and my boyfriend and I were at a party in a neighborhood at the very southern extent of both of these roads. Our friend was there, and needed a ride to his house, which is in a neighborhood almost to the northern extent of the shorter/quieter road. The party ends, we drive on the less busy road to drop him off, and everything seems fine. This is when something bizarre happens, and by this time it is dark.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, at one point, the shorter/less busy road turns slightly to merge with the longer/more busy road (they essentially become the same highway). This bend runs east to west. There is another major thoroughfare that runs east to west that can be turned on to a couple intersections before/after the intersection to get back on the shorter road depending on which way you're going. So we want to get off the busy road and back onto the quieter road to go back home. We turn, and a couple minutes pass, and we realize that we ended up on the other major road that runs east to west. We are 100% sure we turned on to the intended highway to head south. Not the one to head west. Even though it was dark, we have both lived here our entire lives and are very familiar with the routes around the city.\n\nThis was later confirmed by completing the same drive to take the same friend home from the same neighborhood as the 4th of July party a few weeks later. We made the same turn to get on the highway, and this time, we ended up going the right direction. I understand how we may have made the wrong turn if there were multiple ways to turn at the intersection, but the turns are so far apart there's no way we made that mistake. It was almost as if we had been picked up, car and all, and placed on the wrong road and the memory of such was blurred together so that it mad sense to us before we realized we were on the wrong road. It was so bizarre that we even careful watched our surroundings as we made our turn, and triple checked that we had turned the right way. We were worried it was going to happen again, haha. \n\nAgain, sorry if this sounds like nonsense. It's hard to describe without giving out a map and therefore my location. Just thought I'd share one of the most bizarre and eerie experiences in my life. ",

        "text": "This is going to sound fucking crazy and definitely made up, but I need to get this out there. Not sure where else to post this. So this just happened two nights ago. My girlfriend and I are both 19 and live together. We're both attending the same community college in California before we transfer to a much bigger university in about a year. My girlfriend is a Microbiology major who's working on her nursing degree. She has a class/lab combination class that runs from 5:15pm to 10:40pm once a week. We only have one car and I had a lot of studying to do and was planning to use the school's free wifi to do it on my laptop. Here we have a really large 5 story science building, and each floor has a closed terrace with a few tables set up, and a large opening with a view of the sky. While I was working, I happened to look out and saw some very dim lights in the sky. They were moving in a lind of circular motion, but randomly and without any pattern. There was always at least 1 circling up there, with up to 4 more swirling around it. They would overlap sometimes, speed up, slow down. I didn't think anything of it at first, but soon it really started to bother me. I was staring at them, trying to figure out where they could be coming from and I couldn't figure it out. I even tried recording them and taking pictures but they were tpo dim to appear on my shitty phone's camera. ThenI got up and walked downstairs from the 3rd floor I was on and started to walk towards them and find the source. The time then was around 8:30.  They were directly above a large dirt field where they're developing a large building to house livestock in, and I walked to where I seemed to be directly under the lights and looked up at them. They got brighter for a brief moment, and then disappeared completely. As soon as they were gone I got this awful sensation in my arms and legs, like the kind you get when they fall asleep, but all at once and uncomfortable as fuck. My head also started pound like I got hit with a fucking bat, my ears were ringing and my vision got blurry. I turned around in a panic and fell on my face in the dirt since I didn't really have control of my legs. This all happened in a fraction of a second. I got up after I was able to function and stumbled back across the field to the building I walked from, I was going to go upstairs to get my girlfriend from her class. In that state it was all I could think to do, my head was throbbing so badly I could hear my fucking pulse and I couldn't function. I pulled on the door and it was locked. I looked around and realized all the lights in the buildings were off, the only light was from the streetlamps that lit the walkways. I pulled out my phone. The time was exactly 1:37 AM, over 5 fucking hours had passed somehow. I had about 50 missed calls from my girlfriend and just as many missed texts asking where I was and if i was okay. I just sank to the ground and held my head in my hands until my migraine died down enough to speak. I called her, she frantically asked what happened, where was I, was I okay, etc. I just told her I was at the college and needed to be picked up. I sat in the same spot while she drove over with the friend she had called when she couldn't find me, they'd been going around to my parent's, grandparents and friend's houses looking for me. She stayed on the line the entire time asking questions I couldn't answer. After they picked me up I tried to explain what happened. I know neither of them really believe me. She took me to her parent's house and we stayed the night there. Her mom was a nurse and has all sorts of medical degrees and wanted to be in the same house after hearing what I told my girlfriend. Everyone thinks I've had a mental breakdown and I don't know what to say. I called of work for the next few days and have just been lying in bed all day, I don't have the strength to really do anything or eat much. I feel so weak and drained, and I've been having really bad migraines and stomach aches that come and go and that pills won't help. I know from the way everyone whispers when they think i can't hear tjat they either think I'm lyimg or losing my fucking mind, and I guess I might be. I have suspicions about what happened but I don't want to jump to conclusions. If anyone has any kind of explanation or anywhere else I can post this where someone might I would really appreciate it.
