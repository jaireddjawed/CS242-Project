I am currently employed as an electronics engineer doing test engineering. I have a BS is Electrical Engineering. I am looking to go back to school for a change in career path. I am highly considering a MS in robotics but I kind of have some confusion. What would be the difference in course work if I did an MS focused on embedded systems? From what I gathered there seems to be a lot more control systems involved in robotics coursework (makes sense). But not so much hardware/software. I understand that coursework depends where you attend. But Could I do a MS in embedded systems and still look to get into robotics as a career? Likewise I’ve seen some mechatronics concentrations offered. That seems to be very similar to robotics minus the autonomous aspect. Mechatronics seems geared more towards ME rather than EE. Correct? I enjoy working with both hardware and software. I’m just not sure if robotics means more just doing controls systems or can involve the hardware/software aspect as well. I know they all somewhat overlap but not sure to what degree. If I had to sum up my question it would be what is the difference between studying embedded systems vs. robotics and do either limit career opportunities.  If you are a robotics, mechatronics, or embedded systems engineer could you give me some insight as what you do in your job as well? Thank you for any help!!\n",

        "text": "Hello.\n\nI have read up quite a bit about peltier cooling, efficiency and got basic knowledge about how they work. \n\nI just have a quick basic question. I know that they are not very effective at all and basically can't cool anything else than an object that does not create or release heat by itself. But being a major pc nerd i have been thinking if they can be used to cool components. Seeing as they are not good enough to directly cool a cpu, i am wondering if a peltier element can be used to cool a liquid radiator that in turn cools the cpu. I understand that 50 watt will always be 50 watt. But i can achieve tighter isolation around just a radiator and 2 hoses than i can around or inside a whole case.\n\nImagine a tight enclosure of insulation materials around the radiator, with a peltier element inside that enclosure that in turn might or might not be watercooled for efficiency and to keep the noise level down.\n\nI saw a guy cool a small minifridge made of just styrofoam down to -7 celsius with a 200 watt peltierelement. I understand that those temperatures are not reachable with something inside that radiates heat. But do you think i can achieve sub ambient temperatures with correct insulation with the water radiator inside a tight enclosure together with this peltier?\n\nIf not can you explain why? \nAnd if it is indeed possible, should i have a minor exhaust, or atleast something that evens out the air inside said enclosure? \n\nIdeally the peltier will be composed of a smaller heatsink on the cold side with a small fan to drive around and spread the cold, and a huge headsink on the warm side coupled with either fans or outright watercool it with a cpu water cooler. \n\nCan this increase the cooling capacity of my radiator or do you think it will do the opposite? will ofcourse turn off the peltier when the computer is not running, as to not freeze the radiator and ruin it.",

How would that affect the price of electricity? How will that alter the operation planning of my system?  \n\nPeople in this area will be concerned with inflow synthetic scenario generation, the calculation of energy price policy, Bender's cut, the long-term planning for the energy park's expansion and its short-term operation. Research in this area relies heavily on Stochastic Dynamic Dual Programming. \n\nIt's an area that combines Stochastic Hydrology, Power Systems, and Operations Research. \n\nI can find this line of research at the Depart. of EE at U of Illinois (https://ece.illinois.edu/research/power.asp), at Cornell's Dept of Civil and Environmental Eng (http://www.cee.cornell.edu/cee/research/systems.cfm?area=112), and also at Princeton's PENSA group from the Operations Research and Financial Engineering group (https://orfe.princeton.edu/research/groups/pensa). \n\nBut I'm in a search for other departments. The reason for this is two-fold: I want to keep abreast of the latest research findings in the field, and I want to find a group whose research aligns with mine so I can consider it as an option for graduate school. \n\nThanks a lot.",

In an oscillator circuit, where current is supposed to move both forward and backwards, this is obviously a problem. \n\n2) they need to be able to switch between resistance values very quickly, otherwise there'll be too much latency. \n\n3) digipots are pricey! The ones I see online are anywhere from $1 to $5 each. I'll probably need at least 5 of them, plus a couple spares. \n\n\nIf anyone knows of any fast-switching, affordable models that can handle negative voltage, I would really appreciate the advice. Otherwise I could try designing a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and some waveshaping circuits, but this would make it much easier. \n\nThanks in advance!",

I already make $100k, plus overtime. The job is decent. I'm not hard up for advancing my career. But besides the intermittent trouble calls, the scheduled maintenance is extremely repetitive and pretty unfulfilling. I live in the S.F. bay area, and even at my wage buying a home is a daunting task. So a change will definitely be welcome. I also want a better work schedule, and at least slightly less time outside.\n\nI know that at my previous employer (also a transit agency) had in-house engineers topping out at close to $200k, and starting at the same rate as what I make now. My current employer is a brand new system, and they just hired a \"manager of train control systems\" at ~$180k, and I'm sure they would also be looking to hire in-house engineers in the near future.\n\nMy concern is how well my experience as a technician will translate to getting an engineering job. I have been going to school while working full-time for the last couple years, and will continue to do so. I honestly can't afford to quit work and take an internship, due to my day-to-day financial obligations. These transit agency jobs in train control engineering usually require a couple years of relevant experience and I'm worried that if I bother to get my B.S.E.E. it won't be quite enough to make the jump.\n\nSo I'm wondering, is there anyone here that works in the industry that might be able to fill me in? Or are there any hiring managers that might have some advice as to whether technician experience has any value?\n\nThanks in advance.",

If I have a circuit designed that \"works\" and I am trying to make it safe, I want to interpret the standard to say that \"Whatever is inside your circuit, I don't care about, just make sure it's safe on the outside\". \n\nLet's imaging that I have a circuit inside a protectively earthed enclosure (one means of protection). Am I correct in thinking that my second means of protection comes from maintaining sufficient creepage and clearance between the voltages appearing at all nodes in my circuit and ground? This would mean maintaining adequate separation from the enclosure itself, but also adequate separation between high voltage nodes in my circuit and any nodes that are tied to the enclosure potential (i.e. ground plane pads).\n\n*Questions*\n\n1. Is Hi-POT testing only relevant for solid insulation? It seems like it never comes up for clearances and creepages\n\n2. Section 8.9.1.1 of the standard seems to say that ALL circuits nodes need to be separated from one another by the amounts in Tables 11 to 16. However, the tables themselves are described as the creepages and clearances required for providing *means of protection*. If those separations aren't provided, is it just that shorting of that separation is considered a normal condition?\n\n3. Follow up to 2-&gt; is the typical thought process here that you design the internals of your circuit without much regard for those tables, and just providing enough creepage and clearance between traces so that they don't arc during normal operation (I used 1.6kV per mm as a safe creepage)? And then just make sure your entire circuit is well enough isolated from the enclosure? \n\n4. Follow up to 3-&gt;If my circuit is ground referenced and in a protectively earthed enclosure, am I right in thinking that I need every node to meet creepage and clearance (from Table 11-12) to ground everywhere on my board? And then every creepage and clearance on my board is my second means of protection? That would seem to say that double insulating instead of protective earthing can save you a TON of space.... crazy?\n\n5. If two nodes could short together without causing a hazardous situation, would you just provide enough creepage and clearance to allow it to work, and then just ensure that the isolation between pair of nodes and ground is sufficient?\n\n6. Are the distances through the PCB material and the solder resist not considered a solid insulation? They can't possible do hi-pot tests between every node on a PCB, right?!\n\nI don't really expect somebody to be able to answer all of this, but I would expect the help!\n\nTHANKS!!!!!!\n\n\n",

I am a musician and unfortunately don't have any knowledge of electrical engineering. The things I researched come from some Wikipedia Articles and Youtube videos, so bear with me.    \nI'd like to build an \"electric-MIDI-combo-bass-guitar\" by which I mean a standard electric bass with a touch-sensitive fretboard (something like this [MIDI-guitar](https://www.rorguitars.com/products/expressiv-midi-pro) but with a bass guitar). The touch-information should be converted to MIDI data via an Arduino Uno or something similar. My solution would be to just make the fretboard out of a conductive material and attach two wires to either end of it - in my understanding a basic capacitive touch sensor. To separate the detection of the four strings I would just copy the design another three times and put a little space between the four conductive strips. This solution sounds too simple to work and I feel like I am missing a whole bunch of very important stuff. My questions are...\n\n* Would this design work in principle?\n\n* Will the tracking be accurate over the whole 60cm? I feel like that would be too long...\n\n* Will the fretboard be \"multi-touch capable\" so that pressing multiple notes on the same string won't mess up the tracking? In my mind, that wouldn't be possible and I'd need to have a sensor for every fret.\n\nI am happy for any help!",

Care to help?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23) In a subroutine SUBR, which saves the registers, the parameter is passed via stack (the caller removes it). The subroutine does two's complement and returns it via a register R0. Which commands should be placed on `???????` to make the program do the desribed task?\n\n    SUBR ????\n             ????\n             XOR R1, -1, R1\n             ADD R1, 1, R0\n             ????\n    RET\n\n**My answer:** *nothing*; LOAD R1, (SP + 4); *nothing*\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30) Well-known port for World Wide Web, based on HTML, is TCP port 80.

        "text": "Main reason is airflow for cooling while the extra spacing is also preventing inter-component interference. Holes also help absorb sound of cooling fans. Best shape is circular and size from 5 mm to 4 cm. Up to 30% of rectangle area calculated as width*height could be holes.\n\nThis especially for something like computer main boards and graphics cards.\n\nOne other purpose for one big hole in the middle of a computer circuit board: Use it in a case that also has a hole in the middle so that a steel chain can be put through it to prevent thiefs.\n\n\nEDIT: some readers may have done a ridiculous interpretation that drilling holes to existing boards was suggested. Given how badly / lazily some people read, that is a real possibility. No one is suggesting drilling anything. The boards would be designed from ground up to include holes of some shape, maybe circle, maybe square, maybe octagon. The holes would be there before any electronics is placed on the boards.\n",

If my answer is wrong, point it out.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23) For synchronous and asynchronous busses the following holds:\n\n**My answer: Asynchronous are adapted to connecting devices of varying speeds, while synchronous are better used when the devices connected to it have the same speeds.**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24) A subroutine that returns nothing contains `OR R0,R0,R2` and `MOVE R3,R2` (with the assumption that the rightmost operand is the register to save to). If we want to save context before running this subroutine, on the beginning of the program we have to put:\n\n**My answer: PUSH R2;**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30) IPv4 is used. When a router recieves a datagram with TTL = 2 and with an error in a TCP segment which carries the website information. What will the router do?\n\n*Possible answers (delimited by a semicolon):* Discard the datagram; Inform the reciever about the error; Inform the sender about the error; Process the datagram, correct the error based on the checksum and forward the datagram; Process the datagram, set TTL = 1, compute the checksum and forward the datagram\n\nI didn't know this, but my answer would be *Inform the sender about the error*. Am I right?\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks in advance!",

To note, I am based in the Silicon Valley.\n\nA little about me, I worked in the AMS industry for 1 yr; during which, I successfully designed and taped out a type 2 integer-N Charge pump PLL, a Synchronous SAR ADC, and a Bandgap (all of those had lots of senior guidance). But after a year, I had to leave for family reasons. I also have an MS from a top AMS university.\n\nFast forward to now, I've interviewed at a few companies and have performed unsuccessfully. Would any analog gurus be willing to shed some light on how to pass the intense white boarding sessions? Does anyone have a set of fave questions they'd be willing to share with me? (PLL, ADC, OPAMPs/OTAs, etc???)\n\nI love analog design and have dedicated the last 3 yrs of my life to studying it. So any advice is appreciated.\n\nThanks and happy holidays! Cacteo.",
