Jakobson's great as a scholar, but he's also fearless and has a little bit of the poet's blood just beneath the surface. \n\nThis is a eulogy for his friend Vladimir Mayakovsky, but Jakobson expands Mayakovsky's death (he was popular at the time, but not yet THE Mayakovsky) into a tragedy for Russia and the literary world in general. He also gives my favorite description of *byt* by way of contrast to Mayakovsky's creative urge.",
