He uses flint to highlight middle America‚Äôs loss of faith in the Democratic Party and how events like flint that show just how little these people care about you drive down voter turnout. There is definitely some ‚ÄúTrump is an orange idiot‚Äù stuff but I thought it was very substantive and full of good and correct takes about the Alt-right, Democrats and the future of the Democratic Party I.E, AOC who features prominently in the film and the teachers strikes.

Nobody is going to vote when all the polling places are in rich suburbs. Nobody is going to vote when both parties are different flavors of capitalism. Nobody is going to vote if they don't realize how fucked we are because these corporate ghouls got their way for the past 50 years. Nobody is going to vote because they haven't heard of an alternative to the meat grinder system we have of military industrial complex, prison industrial complex, broken healthcare, broken education system and broken labor law combined with anti-union \"right to work\" shit. The fact that felons can't vote doesn't help. Trump has a nearly 100% approval among conservatives and the ones who don't like him just don't like his personality but love his policy. He's the face of capitalism and liberals response to him is toothless attacks of \"he's the Cheeto man!\" Or \"he's gay with Putin!\" They don't challenge the system that created him, they would be happy if a human wasp nest like Marco Rubio won the election when all those corporate friendly conservatives vote nearly the same as Trump's agenda!",

        "text": "Hello.\nMy name is BOOFY and I decided to write this Jojo's Bizzare Adventure story.\nI got the idea to write it after break-first.\nI hope you like it! umm..but you probably wont.Because it suxs.\n\nSo here it goes....enjoy..or not!\n\n\n\nEveryone who looked could see there was a undeniably, ravenous animal attraction between Roman Drake ‚Äè and Jordan B Peterson. \nNo one could deny it. \nNo one except Jordan B Peterson and Roman Drake ‚Äè, that is.\n\nThey seemed blissfully unaware of their attraction to each-other. Unaware of their boundless uncontrollable lust.\nEvery time they met they didn't show it, but everyone knew. Everyone knew what was really going on between them. \n\nA war of lust.\n\nAnd everyone knew that it was a unsuitable situation. No one wanted to be dragged into that war. \nSomething had to be done.\nIt was a typical day in Bumfuck Japan.... before the trouble started.... \n\nIn the middle of all this, finally,Riverview could stand it no longer. \nShe found Roman Drake ‚Äè, and pulled them to one side\n \n\"Thats it! its ruining the team. Its clear you cant function while Jordan B Peterson is around!\"\n\"What no! I am fine.\" \n\"No. Its very clear. You need to do the Attacking the pink fortress with them\"\nEveryone else in the room nodded at this.\n\"But doing the attacking the pink fortress with Jordan B Peterson...isn't that..umm...wrong?\"\n\"Oh, sure, its wrong. Very very wrong.\nBut just because somethings wrong doesn't mean it shouldn't happen does it?\"\n\"No, I suppose not\"\nRoman Drake ‚Äè wondered off thinking of the attacking the pink fortress....how will he introduce the idea to Jordan B Peterson? and would they accept it?\n\n\nSummary:\nI suck at writing summaries. Bsides the 'fic isn't that long!\n\nI am Roman Drake ‚Äè.\n\nI was sitting behind my desk. I felt the tears well up in my eyes . After Our last adventure, I found out just exactly how cruel people could be. How nasty and inconsiderate real humans actually were. I stared at a picture of a polar bear. A magnificent beast who would not hesitate to kill me but at least it would be quick. Not a overlong conspiracy of many years, just to be unleashed on me when I was at my weakest and darkest moment. When I needed my friends the most.\n\nBut there had been one tiny ray of light in this whole . I remembered fondly the day I discovered it. It was a tuesday morning I rememberanced. The memories surfaced before my mind's eye and took the most wonderful shapes. Before I well knew it, a single tear welled up in my eyes and trickled down my cheek.\nBecause even when all my 'friends' betrayed me there was one consistant factor in my life: Virgil Texas.\n\nAnd I knew that the rising aspirations between them could never become true, the feelings I had for Virgil Texas were the only thing in this world that still felt true to him. No lies, just that single, pure sense and feeling for Virgil Texas.\n\nAlas, I thought to meself hopelessly. Why must they battle? Why must I be destined to destroy Virgil Texas? Can I ever tell Virgil Texas how much Virgil Texas means to me?\n\nIf only I could. Then all my pain would be over. No more betrayal. No more suffering under the laughter from The one hot girl from baywatch (who told him she loved me, only to stab me right inti the heart at valentines day!). No, only Virgil Texas and my true feelings for Him. \n\nA/N Lol this has all been so depressive lol! My next bit will be less dark!\n\n\nFortunately Jordan B Peterson worked at a newspaper nowadays and he used the database of the newspaper to find out home turf of Virgil Texas's ruffians. \nTheir search led to a night club in the darkiest and stormiest part of Bumfuck Japan. I was a little hesitant to go. It was rather scary and it was dark and stomy in that secting of Bumfuck Japan. But the courage in me was greater than my fear because with my Stand I should be able to accomplish anything, right, I thought to myself.\nAnd Jordan B Peterson would join me.\n\nSo not to fall out of fashion we both donned their most gothyest clothing. I had to admit that Jordan B Peterson looked kind of sexy in that outfit of his. But I didn't dare to comment on that (I had only just discovered I am bi, and I was a little angxious over that. I wans't sure if my othre friends would accept that!. \nI instead poored down my soul into my make-up. I bore gorgeous blood-rose coloured finger nails with black streaking zig-zags and gave Jordan B Peterson matching treatment. Jordan B Peterson lovely eyes met mine and for a moment we were both swimming in a pool made of a gorgeous combination of their eyes colours. It was romance we knew, but we didn't know whether it was a forbidden one or not!\n\n Then we went off and defeated Virgil Texas.\nRoman Drake ‚Äè finally found a moment to pull Jordan B Peterson away from the others, to have a private moment.\n\"Roman Drake ‚Äè we have to do it\"\n\"I know, my team told me as well. Apparently our feelings are causing problems for everyone else.\"\n\"So we are agreed? We finally let our feelings out of their cages of repression they have been caged in all this time?\"\n\"Yes. For the team\"\n\"No...for us\"\nRoman Drake ‚Äè leapt on Jordan B Peterson at that moment.The raging dolphin they kept locked up finally unleashed.\nRoman Drake ‚Äè and Jordan B Peterson quickly became a ball of body-parts. Buttocks, torsos and noses all tangled together. Roman Drake ‚Äè didn't know what bit to focus on, so grabbed a head and dived in.\n\"More! More! More!\" whispered Jordan B Peterson to Roman Drake ‚Äè.\nTheir love making was like a sunrise of penis's. Its like they were everywhere - inescapable (not that either of them wanted to escape them). \nThings got...messy...from that point on.\n\n\n\nNearby the others occasionally heard screams. But politely ignored it. \nThis had been coming far too long to ruin it now - and this team bonding was very much needed.\nWe exited my wheels and we stood before the place Virgil Texas had been assembleing his forces. It was the gateway to hell. And finally we got confirmation for what we had been expected all along... Virgil Texas.... was satan!\n\nBut that did not deter me. I could press on and 70 seeing my courage, my friends too found the strenght in themselves to push themselves to the limit .\n\nBut then we heard a loud noise, like the stamping of feet or like a bad car engine or when they try and make the ground flat enough so they can build a side-walk. All around us, hisdemons appeared!\n\nVirgil Texas had us. And I know that what he was going to do with us, it wasn't going to be pretty!\n\n\nBut then I saw pure white wings sprouting from my bottom. Where had once been the golden and silver tattooes, I had wings!\n\nI spread them out before me and stretched them. They crackled with power. They were at least 5 meters in windspan. \n\nI then turned to Virgil Texas. He gawked in awe at me. It was a power he had not seen before.\n\"This power,\" Virgil Texas said, \"This power is... I have never... seen... such power.\"\nEven Your mom looked in awe at me. And then she said what everyone (including me) had been thinking but didn't dare to say: \"You're an... you're an... an...\"\n\"Say it, I said\" \"Tell the truth, I can take it!\" I said as I felt the burning nerves in my body floating in my stomach. \n\"An Angel,\" said Virgil Texas in absolute and utter awe. \"THis I... I never have seen before\"\nDonald Trump and Jordan B Peterson were just as much in awe. Though with Donald Trump, I knew it was because he just loved me so much. When I looked in his eyes, it was like I was drowing in a puddle of the deepest of colours. \n\nI stretched my wings further and light came from beneath them, engliphing everyone in the luminating light. The demons had to hide their horrible feces beneath their wings as not to be smitted by the beauty of my light. \nVirgil Texas fell down on his knees and raised his arms in prayer: \"Oh god, let me live. Let me be a part of the light again.\"\n\nAnd I looked down upon him and I was about to engulp him more with my rays but when I saw it was hurting Him I stopped. No one deserved such a fate like that. But I had to burn the evil out of Virgil Texas, else it would return! And so I did. Before us the portal exploded in rays of light and blue and greens and cyans. It was a wonderous spectacle to behold!\n\nDonald Trump ran into my arms and whispered naughty things in my ear. That was what we were going to do tonight, after we're back and rested a bit. \n\nThen I was crowned commander of Bumfuck Japan",
