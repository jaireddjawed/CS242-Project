Will's friendship with Chucky is very strong, easy and they don't need to remind each other that they love and care about each other. \nI now play this movie in the background whenever i'm doing dishes or taking a shower or wtva. I would love to write more about the movie but I felt the urge to write this before I get on my plane.\nI'm interested in reading what you guys thought of the movie.",

The acting was phenomenal, the concept was really interesting, and the writing and direction were pretty great.\n\nI absolutely hated Dixon's character arc. The fact that he is introduced as a racist cop and that it is so casually implied that he harasses people of color prior to the events of the film is fine (fine's not the best word, but i mean as far as setting up a journey of redemption) but his resolution and redemption lacks addressing that glaring character flaw is outrageous. This character flaw feels almost stapled on to make us hate him in the beginning of the movie, and not addressing it at best leaves it ambiguous whether or not that behavior will continue and at worst implies that nothing will change.\n\ni have some other criticisms of the movie, including the ending, but this is the main one. the fact that so many minor details derailed a great film that i was really looking forward to is really rather disappointing. I may be reaching, but I can't help feel like Dixon being portrayed as bigoted is a detail that easily could've been either addressed or omitted.",

It's similar to what OK Computer said about the Information Age but in a cinematic way. \n\nAnd the one who welcomes the new millennium for me is definitely De Palma's Femme Fatale with all his references and his freshness. He's constantly messing with us, playing with all his Hitchcock obsessions, but still putting up his own developed ideas and not delivering, but actually suggesting, new setups for the new generation of directors to come.\n\nI feel like a lot of other films (Millennium Mambo, Yi Yi, Mulholland Drive, Strange Days) could be mentioned here, but I like to hear your inputs on the matter and on the films that you might think it fits better.",

She used her camera very informally in ways, no set course, at times it felt like found footage. And I mean that as a complement, it really felt like a concerted effort to engage the viewer. Adversely there were so many meticulous shots that were incredibly well conceived. Her style is so low key and personal as well. Very refreshing but not just in terms of relief, also revitalizing. The writing (she co wrote it IIRC) was very strong as well, the characters felt well crafted and she and the other writer did an excellent job of getting to the core of their being. Just an awesome movie, even if one didn't think it was excellent it would still be very worth watching.\n\nSo I'd love to encourage discussion of her works and career and to know more about her ideally. What film of hers would you recommend next? I mean it's not easy to find her films in Canada so it may have to be Wings (1966). It's all welcome. I think it's safe to say she's an underrated director and hope to experience more of her works.",

Nowadays, it seems like the horror genre is getting worse and worse every year. To be honest, I think IT and Get Out were one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen, if not for anything else, due to the cringey sporadic bits of comedic relief that sabotage the overall feel of horror. Regardless, there hasn't been many innovative takes on horror at all past few years. Most movies are the typical monster trope where there's a scary killer that hunts down the characters one by one. Wheres the innovation? Wheres the depth? Wheres the creativity? ",

        "text": "I'm not talking about PG horror movies that the whole family can enjoy. I mean horror movies centred on horrific stuff happening to and within the family unit. Mom, dad, kids - usually confined to a single house which is either haunted or the subject of a home invasion.\n\nInsidious, Sinister, The Conjuring, Ouija, Poltergeist, The Shining, The Babadook, The Darkness, Amityville, Orphan, The Omen, Mama, The Others - etc. etc. \n\nI know horror is overwhelmingly a white genre in the U.S., but I cannot even think of a single American horror movie centred on a family with kids that stars people of color?\n\nAm I missing something? And if not, what is it about these stories of familial terror that make them exclusively about white people? Elsewhere we've started to see POC star in major horror movies like The Purge II and IV, and Get Out obviously - plus countless cheap slashers. But this particular subgenre seems to be lagging behind.\n\nHorror has historically veered towards reactionism in how it taps into our society's fears (evil kid movies only became a subgenre after corporal punishment went out of vogue in the 1960s and there was an overwhelming fear that kids/teenagers were 'out-of-control'), so could you perhaps read this specific horror niche as a sort of reaction to something else?",

The prompt for my essay can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/jCmx5). A few things worth knowing...\n\nIn class we have watched the following films/clips from the following films:\n-Gun Crazy (1950)\n-High Noon (1952)\n-The Seven Year Itch (1955)\n-Some Like it Hot (1959)\n-Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf (1966)\n-Bonnie and Clyde (1967)\n-Easy Rider (1968)\n-A Clockwork Orange (1971)\n-The Shining (1980)\n-The Matrix (1999)\n\nWe have spoken about other films such as teenage films from the 50s/60s, blockbusters of the late 70s and 80s/90s (ex. Jaws, Star Wars, Rocky etc.)\n\nWe have studied the following topics:\n-Film Noir \n-Production Code\n-The Hollywood Ten\n-Waldorf Statement\n-The Paramount Decision, Miracle court decision, and Excelsior court decision \n-Directors (such as Orson Welles, Howard Hawks, Billy Wilder, Nicholas Ray, Ida Lupino, Elia Kazan, Alfred Hitchcock and their big films)\n-Rise of Television\n-Auteurism \n-Some actors/actresses (Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, and such)\n-VCR battles \n-SAG strike \n-The Time Warner merger \n-US vs. Capital Services \n\nI’ve also studied film for several years, but I’m currently an English student graduating in 4 weeks. Therefore, I’m a decently good writer so essays aren’t a big concern for me. This paper is short (min 5pgs) and so my main concern is figuring out what to write about. Again, for the actual prompt, please look [here](https://imgur.com/a/jCmx5). Any suggestions, ideas, or opinions are EXTREMELY appreciated. I’m open to talking to others to bounce some ideas back and forth or start a discussion to lead me in the right direction. Thank you again for any help and insight you can provide :) \n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8b92t5/blade_runner_2049_and_why_its_sometimes_difficult/",
        "text": "Watching Blade Runner 2049 in the cinema was, doubtless, one of the most visually satisfying experiences of the year. It’s hard to fault such haunting, beautiful imagery, regardless of what it was saying about the story. Of course, the well composed shots were often there to illustrate whatever point the film was trying to make. Upon reflection and a recent re-watching I’m not convinced the film had anything particularly unnoticeable or hidden to say: it wears its message on its sleeve. But there’s nothing wrong with that; lots of films do. Perhaps my favourite piece of symbolism in the film is the rain, the endless sheets of heavy rain that seem unceasing in the grey and neon world. And then towards the end, the fight in the ocean, the rain now turned to something more concrete and forceful. And then further towards the end, in the last scene, as it’s turned to snow peacefully falling onto K (Ryan Gosling). The message is clear and wonderful: throughout the film K is nothing but a cog in a machine, more a passenger for the film’s plot. As Roy Batty said in the original, he is nothing but a tear in rain: lost and with nothing unique about him. Upon first realising he might be special, might have a childhood, and could be the saviour of his kind, K stands outside a building as snow falls onto him. It turns to water on contact with his skin, and the ground. Is he a special snowflake? Unique among millions, contributing to a greater whole? Is he ‘The One’? The ‘greater whole’ he’s contributing to in his work is a roiling, destructive ocean. Do his actions matter when compared to the power of an ocean? Upon realising he’s been used, that he isn’t special among Replicants he must now fight against the weight of being nothing more than a raindrop. By the end, having done something humanistic, having given his life for a greater cause (namely, reuniting a father and daughter) the snow falls and he sees the truth: that saving the world isn’t human, but small victories are. \n\nI was going to write a piece about how much I appreciated that small symbolism. In a film so dense with semiotic imagery, it was a clean and elegant way to talk about the complexity of the cinematography in the film, and make a point about how the smallest details can contribute to a greater whole of the film. But I couldn’t talk about that without ignoring everything else: silhouettes, eyes, colour, movement, space, sound, soundtrack, women, their lack of agency, the complications of his relationship with Joi, the sheer amount of violence that women in the film are subjected to. It’s important to recognise that absolutely nothing, not a single moment of Blade Runner 2049 is there by accident. Everything served a purpose, everything is a conscious decision. Villeneuve has a history of creating rich, complex characters regardless of gender, and I think Blade Runner 2049 is no different, but did we, somewhere along the way, lose the clarity of his other films through posturing that didn’t particularly have anything beneath it?\n\nThis is all a bit abstract, a bit unformed. But isn’t that often the case? Isn’t that how new ideas are formed, new appreciations for movies come about? I started this piece with the fullest intention to only talk about rain and snow. Maybe I already have? What came after were questions and half-formed thoughts. One of the challenges…maybe that’s not the best term. One of the things I stay aware of when writing, is my position in relation to the piece I’m writing about. I like to think about different aspects of my position for different pieces: where did I watch the film, how often have I seen it, what else have a read about it, is it made for me? Is it made for someone else? Who do I identify with in the film, and why? What does that say? Embodiment, in a word, is what I keep in mind. The phenomenological experience of watching films. Watching I, Daniel Blake, for instance: I believe wholeheartedly what the film is saying, that the welfare system in the UK is appalling and cruel. But can I empathise with those characters? Do I have any idea what it is like to live like that because I’ve seen a movie? To quote Good Will Hunting, “Do you think I'd know the first thing about how hard your life has been, how you feel, who you are because I read Oliver Twist?” Invariably, no. I watch from a privileged perspective. \nWhat this all comes down to, as well as feeling confused and doubtful about the gender dynamics of Blade Runner 2049, is that I can only ever present a subjective, partially-informed piece of writing about movies. I can never, for instance, say what a film is about for sure. Nor can I say what message it intended. I can’t say whether it was good or bad objectively. All I can do is say what I think, myself. Otherwise all I’d be doing is asking questions. But is that so bad? Isn’t it possible to make a statement by asking questions? Isn’t the question almost as important as the answer? The specific wording can imply thousands of different things, right? Or is that just posturing too, is that just absolving myself of responsibility to come up with answers? This has been a thousand words with lots of questions, but did it really answer any of them? Is it just more tears in rain, or is it part of snowfall?\n\nThis being part of a recent article of mine, I should plug it at the end here, if that's ok - [Filmosophy.co.uk](filmosophy.co.uk) \n\nI'd really love to get your opinions on this, it's not limited to Blade Runner by any means\n\nEDIT: cleanliness, formatting, housekeeping, you know the drill.",

        "text": "In 1995, Scorsese released his last film with Robert De Niro. It was also his final film with Joe Pesci. That is, of course, before the announcement of his new film, which will include both actors as well as Al Pacino and Harvey Keitel.\n\nAnd this is probably the last movie these actors will ever do together, so on that effort alone, much like the new Twin Peaks, it is already quite incredible. And it's still over a year away from before being released.\n\nBut a small part of me is worried, especially after learning about its reliance on CGI \"de-aging\", that Scorsese is himself trying to capture something he once was. Something he already mastered.\n\n\nAnd that was Casino. It was his final \"pure\" mob movie, in a trilogy lasting over two decades. Starting with Mean Streets, a film about young, lower level mobsters, to Goodfellas, comfortable middle men, and finally Casino, the 1% of the 1%. The Uber elite.\n\nAnd we follow not just a hustler, or a bookie, or a traditional gangster like any of his other movies.\n\nWhat is Ace? What is his job?\n\nThat's right. He's a director. And directing a Casino seems in many ways linked to directing a movie. Hundreds of people. Millions of dollars. Bright lights, fast money, beautiful women. Everything under his watchful eye and careful control. \n\nThis is Scorsese's 8 1/2. Goodfellas was his La Dolce Vida, he basically poured his entire life up to that point into his previous film, and now was essentially out of ideas. He turned to the same writer as the book Goodfellas was adapted from, Nicolas Pileggi, and from that we have Casino.\n\nIts scope is titanic. It's characters are almost more real than real life. One thing not made entirely clear (probably done intentionally to keep from overwhelming the audience) is what the mob boss group know only as \" the Outfit\" is doing and where are they from.\n\nThey are the Chicago outfit, the largest mafia organization to ever exist. The guys whose dads worked with Al Capone. Which really raises question why Scorsese has returned to Chicago for his next film, especially considering possible CIA connections the Chicago mob. But I digress.\n\nThe film itself is clearly a Catholic metaphor for Scorsese himself. The opening sequence, of being blown up and sent to hell, doesn't really make sense if it's literally meant to signify Ace, as he's Jewish and the Torah makes no mention of hell.\n\nHell is a distinctly Christian, and more specifically Catholic conception. The music, by Bach, is as well, and Scorsese himself has even said he believes he is going to hell because of his multiple divorces.\n\nI realize I've talked very little about the actual content of the film, as I think that is obvious, and for those who haven't seen it, redundant.\n\nBut the masterful voice over, the godly camerawork, and the mind blowing soundtrack are all good reasons. Add to it a painful melodrama wrapped inside of a mob empire spanning half the country.\n\n\nThe only problem with the 3 hour runtime? It wasn't longer.\n\n\nEdit: I wish I had titled this \"caSINo\"",

        "text": "It's a fact that Spike Jonze and Sofia Coppola were married. That they were a couple, shared a life.\n It is said 'Her' and 'Lost In Translation' are deeply connected, that they talk to each other. That they're two different views of one fact. \nI don't know how much of that is true and I don't by any means intent on figuring out either of the artists' intentions. But I feel they do carry a very interesting parallelism, so here's my take on analysing that reality, starting with Sofia's work; \n\n(I have written about Lost In Translation here before and some parts are copied and pasted, sorry about that, if you happened to read that before, which I doubt you remember anyways.)\n\n**SPOILERS AHEAD OF COURSE**\n\n\n\nShe's newly married, he's getting into *those* years. Their life is looking a bit scary at the moment. \n\nShe's pretty alone, she doesn't know who she's married, her friends don't really care much about her, she isn't feeling what she thinks she should, she's a bit lost.\nHe's gotten tired of making movies and filming, that part of his life isn't interesting anymore, it's lost its meaning. He's not in the best terms with his wife, we can guess by that scene where they send him a *massage* his sexlife's getting tougher too. He loves his children but they're growing up and growing apart, he doesn't quite feel the love from them, says they miss him but would be okay without him. He's quite lost too.\n\n\nAnd where would these two people meet but in Tokyo. An exciting and beautiful city, but a very particular one, different, often hostile, alienating too. Tokyo is the perfect metaphore for the translation they're going through in their lives. **Hard to live in, beautiful once you settle in**. Just as it's hostile it is exciting, and very much so. And its wonderfulness comes to us viewers eventually. Their relationship translates Tokyo into a cozy, charming, graceful place. Just as we see them find answers and getting through the cracks in their lives, we see the city light up. The film changes its tone, the atmosphere gets lighter, it's drifting us somewhere, we hear music, it's melancholic, it's nostalgic, it carries the full weight of something pretty that's going on but that sadly and just like everything, is bound to end. \nBecause this is not **that** kind of love story. Despite everything, he still loves his wife and children and she does too love her partner. \n\nIn Tokyo they found each other and in each other they found a push to get them through to the next stage in the big game of life. Because just like Tokyo, it might be big and scary, but it's a stage they want to get to, for life isn't always what we want it to be but it's still an exciting journey we can't really pause or delay; **hard to live in, beautiful once we settle in**. This is the kind of love story life gives us when we need to straighten out, when we need not a fresh start but to succesfully *translate* what's coming, and move on. \n\n\nThey needed each other so they could find themselves, understand not only Japan, but the challenge they're about to face, because they must face it and they want to face it, and thanks to their so special relationship, they'll do so effectively.\n\nTheir love? As real as love can get, it only existed in Tokyo, it got lost in translation.\n\n\nIt is said Spike Jonze interpreted Sofia was talking to him and if we go by those lines and see 'Her' as his answer, we can say he did not feel the story and testimony from his once partner in life was a good representation of their relationship, or at least that it didn't really picture both parts of it quite accurately enough.\n\nAnd is there a prettier and more powerful way to have a talk but with poetry? He decides to answer ten years later with 'Her', materializing a cinematographic conversation. They end up talking to each other through art, the purest form of expression. Leaving in the process, their experiences to us to learn from, understand, and relate to. \n\nIn 'Her' Jonze depicts a different reality, **hers**. \nOur protagonist here is indeed lost, and is indeed saved, but his fate ends up being a different one. He counters Coppola's view even with the photography and aesthetics of the film. It's still dazzling, but it's different, just like 'Her' which is of course Jonze's analogy of their shared life. \n\nTheodore finds himself again in Samantha, after being broken and lost for years following the ending of his long term relationship with Catherine. \n\nAnd just like in 'Lost In Translation' the film gains color and beauty as our protagonists get acquainted, and fall in love. \nIt's no coincidence Samantha is an artificial being, an OS. This is not negatively conceived in the movie and by no means doesn't make her a live being, but it does hint some realities; she's specially different, and most importantly, it makes them essentially unlike in nature. \n\nThey learn from each other here too. Theodore finds beauty in the world again and excitement in her. But we could say one outgrows the other because Samantha finds a new state of being. This is their key problem. Theodore can't keep up with her, and Samantha feels slowed down by him. What was once a harmonic relationship isn't cohesive anymore.\nBut he can’t really bear much of a grudge when she leaves him, he still has her happiness in mind, which does not mean he isn’t destroyed because the fact is he is. The tone changes, it’s sad but it isn’t that grey, it’s again, nostalgic. He’s sad and that’s a fact, but he gets it, he’s alone again but not broken anymore, left with a new perspective about everything.\n\nHer passage in his life was indeed key to transform and translate him but we guess maybe he hoped it would last longer, wished it wouldn’t get lost in translation, that life didn’t have as many stages, that love wasn’t such a crude rality, for the message and meaning these two films have in common is that love, in the end, is a tool.\nIt makes us vulnerable, dependant on someone else, it makes us lose control. That makes the human being crazy, sure. But in losing control there’s a new state of being too, because love elevates us, it makes us find ourselves, grow. There’s only so much we can achieve if we don’t let go and let ourselves be. Truth is, what else is true love if not the most powerful aid in making us bigger?\nMaybe it’s not always perceived and experienced in the same way by all of the parties involved, for that’s the other thing these two films share; love ends. Some wish it wouldn’t have to be that way and be infinite. Others see that as a good thing, trusting and believing in the immaculate perfection of that what is limited.\n\nEdit: words and some structural changes",

        "text": "Down By Law was on TCM last night so I finally crossed it off my \"to see\" list. The most impressive aspect about it to me was the sound design. Both the constant background noises (sirens, dogs barking, etc) and the music add a lot of atmosphere and mood to the picture. The jazz in the score works perfect to this end and got me thinking of other films where jazz creates such a strong mood. The Ascenseur pour l'échafaud soundtrack, which was improvised by Miles Davis as he watched the film in the studio, immediately came to mind. Sax in noir in general does as well, but also the jazz percussion in Birdman for a more contemporary example. It occurs to me how significant film is to jazz in the last few decades, even though film is barely discussed in most narratives of \"jazz history.\" It's through movies that most people encounter jazz, and it's through film that it's remained more than an academic exercise. That's what I'm pondering anyway. \n\nWhat are some of your favorite uses of jazz in film history?",

As I have since read a considerable amount this impression has proven false as his politics is a very important part of, or at least influential on, his theory.\n\nThe same can be said for Kracauer to some extent and perhaps others, I seem to recall some very reductive Lacanian or Freudian readings of horror-films as well.\n\nRecently I saw a talk where a ph.d. student presented an analysis of the average percentages of differents framings used in a tv-show, but was not followed by any theoretical insights into what that might mean, only that it was different than other shows. Counting close-ups counted as academia, but left me with a sense that he probably had some ideas about the meaning of this, but was unsure as to whether it would be non-professional to share them. \n\nIs the crisis of the humanities forcing film studies to turn to a purely practical (as far as possible) view of theory as complimentary sets of tools instead of extremely distinct socially and politically grounded world-views?\n\nPerhaps my questions have some sort of flaw or are worded imprecisely, I hope you will be forgiving.",

        "text": "Very rarely does the score serve the movie as a whole and often it completely overwhelms the picture. The cinematography + Phoenix's performance are already so good at evoking claustrophobia, dread, and unease that silence (or at least a more restrained score) would often serve the mood better than Jonny \"Music for Horror Movies in 2074\" Greenwood's minor key string plucking. The biggest issue I have is that, intsead of helping you immerse yourself in the experience of the movie, the score constantly reminds you that you're watching a movie, like a hyperactive child demanding that you pay attention to their antics. I don't want or need such a heavy hand telling me what I'm supposed to feel during this or that scene.\n\nThere's a shoutout to Psycho in the movie so that's clearly an influence, but even the shower scene that's referenced has a monster silent build-up which, along with Bates' shadow, builds tension better than any instrument could.\n\nTo be fair, there are times when it's done perfectly, like the accelerated ticking and slamming when Joe is wandering through the Governor's mansion. Without the sound queues there, it'd be difficult to tell just from the picture that Joe is becoming unhinged. It's a shame that the parsimony Greenwood showed in that scene wasn't extended to the rest of the movie.\n\nI'm ragging on Greenwood but in general I love his work, especially There Will Be Blood. One of the reasons why I think his approach works there and not here is that There Will Be Blood is often a hilarious movie, and the score heightens that demented, madcap exuberance. You Were Never Really Here is not funny at all (except for the scene involving I've Never Been to Me), it's grimdark to the nth degree and the quirky energy of the score feels out of place as a result.\n\nA similar movie that took this approach and did it right was Good Time. A very unsettling and exhausting score, but one that bubbles and writhes beneath the surface of the action and gives room for the picture and actors to breathe. \n\nedit: a word",

        "text": "**TL;DR**\n\nI'm sorry this dragged on for so long, but what is, is.\n\nTo sum things up, this movie is weird, man. The idea isnt new, but the way its presented is refreshing. The film is far too long, and a lot of it is unnecessary and tacky. I recommend watching it at some point, purely to see what it looks like when someone honestly tries and totally drops the ball. Overall I rate this movie 4/10 - It's not good, not bad, just strange. \n\n**Opening Thoughts**\n\nI'm currently watching *Enter the Void* by Gaspar Noé, right around the 140 minute mark. There is already a great thread on this sub about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/45eii9/my_problem_with_gaspar_noes_enter_the_void_2009/), and they hit a lot of points about it that I wont repeat.\n\nI'd like to start off by saying that I dont think this is a *bad* film as such. I've didn'd dislike watching it, and I found the concept quite interesting - and the way it is presented is quite new.\n\nThat being said, I think this film is total and utter nonsense. It's a shock and awe film at its core, with very little substance. I didnt like any of the main characters, I didnt like the \"dream sequence\" gimmick, and the plot is lacking. I'll go a little further into why I don't like these elements.\n\n**The Characters**\n\n* Oscar: My main criticism of this guy is that he's boring, and I'm sorry to say, but Nathaniel Brown didn't do a great job. His dialogue is very monotone and unrealistic. Real people don't talk like that. The way he treats his sister is also unrealistic, I mean who would knowingly let their younger sister get mixed up with a pimp/strip club owner. I get that he's probably fried his brain from too many drugs, but  come on - she's all the family he has in the world. Also who the fuck takes LSD or DMT daily and still function, your body only has so much serotonin to go around.\n\n* Linda: I hated her. She is so unbelievably stupid, and annoying. I know its a trope that the female character is a bit ditzy, but she takes the cake. She's fresh in Tokyo, and doesn't know anyone but her brother, yet she disappears for an amount of time with a skeevy older japanese guy? Nobody is that trusting, even on MDMA. And the scene where shes stripping away infront of Oscar, and didnt seem shy or nervous. Thats a little strange. The scene later in the film where Victor shows up at the door to apologize she screams \"Get the fuck out of my house\" over and over. Lady, he never came inside. He is very clearly in the hallway outside the apartment. WTF, yo! Also it seems like she is constantly drunk, or on some opiate/benzo throughout the film - she speaks very slowly, and with short and simple sentences.\n\n* Alex: I actually liked this character, there wasnt much too him - He's the quintessential drug taking, party going, free thinking dude that anyone involved in that scene will have met at some point. He seems genuinely concerned for Oscars well being, without being too pushy about it. Examples of this are when he tells Oscar to ease up on the psychedelics or when he warns him about Bruno the drug dealer. The scene where he's hiding out on the street writing \"I want 2 die\" on the wall was a bit odd, but I'll give it a pass.\n\n* Victor: Fuck this kid, he's such a spineless, whiny little shit. He finds out that his friend/drug dealer is giving his mother a poke, so he calls the cops on him which ends up with him dead. I get that he seemingly shows remorse for this with the \"I'm sorry\" to Oscar before the cops bum rush him, but if he is sorry when why do it in the first place? He also doesn't have any concept of cause and effect. Its as if he didn't understand that calling the cops would result in the cops actually confronting his friend. Plus, what an overreaction to finding out that he's riding your mum. He knew he had a sister, so why not try shag her as \"revenge\". He shat the bed big style by cutting off his drug supply. Again, WTF, yo!\n\n**The Dream Sequence**\n\nI know its not really a dream sequence, its supposed to be Oscars life flashing before his eyes as he dies, and the whole book of the dead schtick - but its a similar enough gimmick that they're effectively the same. \n\nThe reason I don't like them, is that they're either too complicated to follow - like in this film, or that in the end it's revealed to not have happened - which I was 100% expecting to happen in this film. In short, the director either bites off more than they can chew by trying to break the trope - or its too predictable.\n\nSo to get on with the *dream sequence* in this film, it made no fuckin' sense. Don't get me wrong, visually it was pretty good, and I thought it was quite cool - but my main issue with it is why should I care? They kill the main character within the first 15 minutes or so, and then follow that with over two hours of nonsense. To me it seemed like the type of thing that stereotypical stoners would say \"It blew my mind, *maaaan*\". I don't think they're the target audience though, Noé really tried to create art here. Its very high concept stuff, and its clear a lot of thought went into it, but I ask again, why should I care?\n\n**The Plot**\n\nThe story is as follows: Orphaned drug dealer lives with his sister in Tokyo. Drug dealer goes to meet client who sold him out to the cops. Drug dealer gets shot and dies. 2 hours of colorful, swooping shots of Drug dealers life. 20 minute sex scene. Movie Ends.\n\nTheres not a whole lot going on here. Its all very obvious stuff. There isnt really much I can say that wasn't covered in the other thread about this film, which is unfortunate because I get the feeling that Noé thought this was going to be his Magnus Opus, would put his name on the map.\n\n**The Ending** \n\nI started writing this before I finished the film, which wasn't the best move to make in order to get a clear picture of the film as a whole. However, what followed was around 20 minutes of sex scenes (some of which I think were un-simulated). What was Noé thinking?! He was clearly trying to express something with this, but I think it was gross, cheap, and completely broke immersion.\n\nIf you're reading this Noé, nobody wants to see 20 minutes of weird, blurry sex scenes.\n\n**The Incestuous Implication**\n\nWas it just me, or did Oscar and Linda seem a little *too* close. I realize that they were all each other had, but it seemed very sexual to me. ",

        "text": "Arrival didn't survive the re-watch for me. First time round I enjoyed it to a certain extent, but this time it didn't engage me all that much and I couldn't help thinking about the dreadful dialogue, the completely failed attempt to build a convincing relationship between both leads, the contrived climax and the under-utilisation of the (brilliant) score.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest disappointment was the cinematography. Is it me, or is Arrival's cinematography quite poor in places? I mean, not just nondescript and functional like in many movies, but actually serving as detrimental to the film.\n\nShots seem to me to be very poorly lit. It makes the image murky and grainy, in a way that feels unintentionally unappealing rather than moody. All the scenes in the military tent complex, which is 75% of the film, look incredibly drab. I'm sure you can think of another alien-related film, also about the theme of birth, which makes far better use of dark and sterile environments.\n\nThe other problem is the weird framing. Far too many shots of characters' backs. I don't mean in shot reverse shot: I mean in shots with a single subject. I lost track of the amount of times a character was talking and I was looking at the screen wondering why I was seeing the back of their head, or the back of their head and just enough of the side as to see their mouth. Why?\n\nThe only notable shots are a few of the exterior ones of the spacecraft, and perhaps the gravity tunnel thing. That first helicopter shot of the spaceship which the film brilliantly builds up to (idiotically used in the film's trailer) with the fog rolling over the hills is stunning, largely due to the design of the ship itself and aided by the score.\n\nBut other than that, a really flat film, visually. What a strange thing for a director to go from this to Blade Runner 2049: it really shows the importance of the DP.\n\nAm I missing something?",

        "text": "Gladiator — The Birth of the Modern Epic\nVideo Form: https://youtu.be/NboEajWsoyo\nThere was a time when Hollywood made movies as big as the Roman Empire: Monumental in scope, the types of films that would swallow an entire afternoon. The era of the Hollywood period epic was indeed out of style for about 40 years. This was the time that came before the birth of the modern blockbuster, and the imminent age of Spielberg, the blazing skyscrapers and sunken ships that ruled movie theaters from the 70’s to the early 2000’s. The “sword and sandal” genre disappeared to favour the sci-fi and visual effects revolution of modern cinema.\n\nIt was until the start of the new millenium that Ridley Scott’s Gladiator made one hell of a comeback in the genre. It succeeded in touching on all the themes and scope of the period epic, while using modern filmmaking techniques to create utter impact in audiences, with great performances and grand ambition. What follows is an exploration of Gladiator, its themes and characters; as well as its influence on the film industry in the 21st century.\n\nBefore the opening battle scene, Maximus grabs some dirt and rubs it in his hands. This is something he repeatedly does throughout the film, which makes it clear that he’s not afraid to get his hands dirty (literally and symbolically), as well as reminding him of the peaceful life he led as a farmer. Russell Crowe seems like a throwback to the movie stars of the past, like Kirk Douglas in Spartacus, athletic without looking like a bodybuilder.  The opening of the film shows us his fearlessness to ride straight into a battle, leading his own army. This dirty, visceral scene sets the tone for the entire film. The hordes of extras crashing against each other reminds us of Hollywood’s old days. The amazing use of steadicam and stroboscopic editing places the viewer in the middle of the action. \n\nThings look very dark here, the scene is lit this way to symbolize how the Romans thought of the world outside the Empire: “It is brutal and cruel and dark. Rome is the light.” But of course, the lighting here also sets the tone for the tragic unfolding of events in the movie.\n\n\nShortly after we’re introduced to Commodus, the son of Marcus Aurelius and perhaps one of the most hated villains in film history. And even though he definitely is a total prick, what isn’t usually addressed is how his character is kind of understandable. Meaning the guy was getting ready to be emperor for his entire life and suddenly he’s told the job will be given to Maximus. The lack of love from his father ultimately and maybe inevitably created a monster. After the cruel unfolding of events that set the main plot in motion, the main theme of the film is revealed: Revenge.\n\nOnce he arrives in Rome, Maximus’ entire meaning of life revolves around revenge. He decides to continue to fight as a Gladiator until he can get to Commodus, who is directly responsible for the death of his family and mentor. This is the most obvious representation of the desire for vengeance in Gladiator. “I have only one more life to take. Then it is done.” Maximus doesn’t enjoy killing in the arena, but every man that dies by his sword gets him one step closer to killing Commodus. Maximus isn’t the only character bent on revenge. It may seem that Commodus’ sole motivation is found in politics, but the reality is he shares some of the same motivation that drives Maximus. Commodus kills his father because of his decision to make Rome a republic, refusing to make him emperor and continuously tries to kill Maximus. In him he sees what he never had: the love of his father and of the people. \n\n“Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the emperor of Rome.” Another major theme in Gladiator is the power even a slave can have when he has the support of the crowd. Commodus desperately wants to kill Maximus, but can’t because he’s loved by the crowd. “I am a slave. What possible difference can I make?” It takes a while for Maximus to realize that even he can wield this much power. The power of the people. What Marcus Aurelius sees in him is the realization that the best politicians are the people who don’t want to be politicians. \n\nThere’s also an irony about Rome in the film. Even though it’s technically the most civilized of cities, in a way, it’s also uncivil, even compared to the wastelands of Africa. The most brutal combats take place here, in the Coliseum and despite the alleged “peace” that was to be achieved if the Romans won the opening battle, the city is divided. There is a cold war raging between Commodus and the Senators, the people hate the new Emperor and his sister struggles with his incestous tendencies.\n\nDeath rules over all in Ancient Rome. Maximus killed countless soldiers as a general and kills even more as a gladiator; and Commodus has whomever he pleases killed. It’s a time when death is seen as the main source of entertainment. But it may be that what’s more important than the immense body count, are the reflections Maximus has about death. “What we do in life, echoes in eternity.” He has a deep connection to the afterlife, reflected in the opening and final scenes where he runs the wheat across his hand. At no point does he seem afraid of death, because he knows that as long as we are remembered, we will never really die. “I knew a man who once said, “Death smiles at us all.” All a man can do is smile back.”. Maximus’ death is tragic, but it also proves to be heroic and meaningful. Oddly, Commodus’ death is also meaningful, as we are left to believe that it saved Rome, even if it wasn’t heroic at all.\n\n“My name is gladiator.” The film isn’t the story about Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the armies of the north. It’s the story about a man’s struggle against decadence in his society, a man driven not by power, but by revenge and loyalty. It may be the number one reason for Hollywood’s attempt at the revival of historical epics, as even Ridley Scott has attempted to recreate the same feeling several times in the past few years. But as each one of those attempts failed to live up to expectations, with each poster and every one of those movies, we are reminded of the glory of Gladiator.\n\nVideo Form: https://youtu.be/NboEajWsoyo\n",

My full review is [here](https://theartintrying.wordpress.com/2018/04/08/a-quiet-place-review/) if you want some more in depth thoughts, but I ultimately felt the movie didn't add up the way it should. Almost every part of the movie just needed a bit more polish for it to truly shine, and when that happens, that usually points to the director.\n\nOf course I want to hear your thoughts on the movie and if you agree, but I also want to have a discussion on movies you felt  were  never able to elevate themselves due to weak direction, and why you felt that way.

        "text": "Today, for no reason at all, I woke up and decided I wanted to watch one of those movie posters I saw on the walls of my house growing up. 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nI watched it streaming online for free. \n\nA lot of it was overly long to the point that I got frustrated and irritable. So irritable that I began to have repressed (at the time)  fantasies of giving it a very negative review online, or even releasing a widely popular \"200 Greatest Movies of all Time\" list, in which I either listed it just before *Rat Race*, or in which it gets its own \"worst movies of all time\" section, where I would rant about how Kubrick was just the Neckbeard that Could, and his horribly slow movie, which should have been ten minutes of mediocrity, somehow convinced contemptible, judgemental people around the world that he's a genius, and that he was born in the exact right time, place, and etc for this to happen:\n\n&gt;You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of the film—and such speculation is one indication that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep level—but I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for 2001 that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's missed the point.[1]\n\n\nWithout this guy being punched in the face.\n\nApproximately 16 hours later, I came to accept that I would not only remember, but actually *hear* \"I am afraid\" from that stupid robot on my deathbed, and that I was frustrated by not only how movie snobs who won't admit that they aren't really *just fascinated* by a very slow zoom-out of a guy in an outdated space-suit, but also how that man also manipulated me into becoming one of them, before I realized he was appealing to more shallow emotions with tricks I can't pinpoint. There is a part of me that wants to give in and become a born-again *Kubrickistan* right now, but there is a bigger part of me that knows that I can think clearly, and that he *did* use that boringness against me. That wasn't \"oh, just something I didn't notice, when really it was helping me all along\" like that robot man was helping that blue-eyed man in the film. That was something manipulative, something Stockholm, which a fresh victim can recognize, but a later victim will only rationalize. \n\nI want to say that there is something unusual about *the film market* that only the true expert can counterfuse: It has a second market.\n\nThe one when you've sobered up from the hell they've put you through, 12 hours later, and for some reason you're thinking, \"Nothing bad happened there. That wasn't an anal, full-blown male-on-male rape at all. What is anyone talking about? I'm sorry, Hal, I'm afraid I can't do that.\" \n\nThat's Stanley Kubrick. \n\n11 minutes in edit: I *really* don't want this to come off that I'm saying that *Rat Race* is a bad movie, because I really think it's one of the greatest movies of all time. I'm a huge fan of *Rat Race.* My point is that I think that Kubrick fans probably have their nose way up their anus and think that *2001* was far above *Rat Race* when these movies were in fact at a similar level in their craft. **The point of this review is *not* to insult *Rat Race*, which I maintain is the single greatest film I've ever seen.** ",

        "text": "Movie Review – What About Me (1993) directed by Rachel Amodeo\n  \nWhat About Me is a small slice of a forgotten New York! An obscure, black-and-white film that is culturally, socially, and historically significant, what more could you want?  I find myself strangely nostalgic for the East Village in the early nineties. I previously read Don DeLillo’s Mao II, which spends time describing the gruesome homeless encampment in Tompkins Square Park, so the footage in this movie is a treat because it preserves a world and a culture that no longer exists.\n  \nThe beginning of the movie is a little surreal, as you see a young girl come out of a house to go on a bike ride, she then rides past a cemetery and falls from a cliff to her death. Next, the girl has a conversation with God, and is reincarnated as Lisa Napolitano. Lisa loses her parents, goes to live with her aunt in the East Village, loses her aunt, and then is raped by the building landlord, who evicts her from the apartment a day later. The rest of the movie is concerned with Lisa trying to survive on the streets.\n  \nThe film has a spontaneity and an aesthetic that feels much older, almost like a silent film. I am still mulling over the significance of Lisa’s previous life and reincarnation, though it doesn’t have much of an impact on the general plot. I believe the structure of the movie (and the movie’s biggest strength) is to allow for vignettes. A punk Casanova named Tom is shown picking up a girl at a bar, and later introduces Lisa to crack cocaine. Lisa is invited to stay at the house of a woman who turns out to be a dominatrix. Gangsters enact revenge on a man coming out of an apartment building. These scenes blend into the story well, without taking the film too far astray. Many counter-culture icons make cameos in the film, with Dee Dee Ramone, Johnny Thunders, and Gregory Corso among them.\n  \nHaving spoken with an old friend of mine, who has been driving cabs in the city since the seventies, he said when going into Alphabet City, the names of the avenues indicated the degree safety. Avenue A meant that you were “alright,” Avenue B meant “be careful,” Avenue C meant “critical,” and Avenue D meant that you were “dead.” On February 2nd of this year, I ventured into the park on a cold but sunny day, to see if there were any remnants of the old scene. It honestly looked to me like any other Manhattan park. I imagine I’m very much romanticizing a world that I know nothing about, which is why more people need to see this film.\n  \nWatch the movie on Fandor [here](https://www.fandor.com/films/what_about_me)\n\nCheck out my blog!

        "text": "‘Sup Reddit?\n\nSo today I watched both La Chienne and Scarlet Street for a class I am taking on the films of Fritz Lang. I watched the Renoir film in the afternoon and the Lang film about seven hours later in my home, and I enjoyed La Chienne much more. I liked the performances more, I found the visual compositions more engaging and interesting, and overall appreciated the stylistic choices made in La Chienne much more. \n\nSo after I finished Scarlet Street I hopped over to Letterboxd because I was curious as to how other people thought they compared. I wasn’t shocked to see way more people had seen Scarlet Street, and I thought it was interesting that they were so close on average rating (Scarlet Street edges it out over La Chienne). What I was a little surprised by, was seemingly the only time they were put into conversation in reviews was in reviews for La Chienne, in which most people seemed to prefer Scarlet Street. I was intrigued that many people had the opposite experience that I did. \n\nI have a couple of theories as to why. The first is that I may have had some bias having seen La Chienne first and/ or many people had some bias having seen Scarlet Street first. The second is that Scarlet Street is preferred because it more clearly falls in line with an American film noir aesthetic, and people who are inclined to appreciate that genre (which I’m one of don’t get me wrong) are more likely to be predisposed to liking Scarlet Street.\n\nAnyway this post isn’t to complain that people are wrong for enjoying Scarlet Street more. I think having either opinion is perfectly valid, but I’m interested in seeing what this sub thinks about both films. \n\nTLDR; I like La Chienne more than Scarlet Street. Which do you like more and why?\n\nAlso, sorry if the formatting is weird I’m on mobile about to go to bed so this might look weird and have spelling/ grammatical errors.",

It seems like Luke kind of just reacts to the situations that Vader creates. First, Vader attacks Hoth so Luke has to escape to Dagobah. Then, Vader captures his friends so Luke has to rescue them. Finally, Vader corners Luke and drops the truth bomb, so Luke tries to kill himself. Everything that happens is outisde of his control. Wouldn't this make him a passive protagonist? And if so, is that a bad thing? A passive protagonist usually carries negative connotations. One of the main criticisms I've heard of Rogue One is that Jyn is a passive protagonist.  However, I think it works really well in Empire. What do you think? If Luke is a passive protagonist, what makes it work in Empire but not Rogue One? ",

        "text": "&gt; **This is a lengthy one, but I’ve never really gone over what I feel about Wiseau and *The Room*, Franco and *The Disaster Artist*, or Sestero and *Best F(r)iends: Volume One*. Feelings subject to change - for better or worse - when I see the second volume in June.**\n\nI wasn’t a fan of *The Disaster Artist*. It’d probably crack a list of my least favorites of last year (if I were to ever do it.) I’d like to attribute it to being some kind of unforgiven beef with James Franco’s *The Broken Tower*, which has got to be one of the most discomforting experiences I’ve ever had watching something. I just don’t think Franco is a very good director. \n\nIf he was being self-aware about his own critical detraction as a director (it seems I’m not the only who thinks he sucks) through the story of Tommy Wiseau, you think he’d actually do more with it other than rehashing everything we already had. There wasn’t anything connective for him in the material, and instead of inviting the material in for self-reflection, he stands at a distance and condescends everything about the people’s stories he was adapting. \n\nHe simply lifts from Greg Sestero’s memoir, rather than doing anything worth a new lens; relying on the repetition of the book’s events to be the jokes (when it’s not just relying on people to laugh at the same value we get from *The Room* on its own terms). He also trivialized Tommy Wiseau - ending the film with a title card of \"nobody still knows anything about [him]\", when it's easy to research his background (a tragic one) from war-torn Poland, to suffering brain damage in a car accident in New Orleans. And yet, still, Franco parades him around like a cartoon.\n\nIn short, I wasn’t a fan of *The Disaster Artist* to a degree to where it’d probably crack a list of my least favorites last year (if I were to ever do it.) I’d like to attribute to it being some kind of unforgiven beef with James Franco’s *The Broken Tower*, which has got to be one of the most discomforting experiences I’ve ever had watching something. I just don’t think Franco is a very good director.\n\nOh, look, I pulled a Franco.\n\nAt the start of *The Disaster Artist*, Franco introduces the concept of *The Room* and the enigma of Tommy Wiseau by featuring celebrities of actual “success” commenting on it. It’s shot like standard “talking heads”, only produced like advertisements from *Access Hollywood*. It’s full of cringe, and enlightening to how Franco basically trivialized and exploited a real human [bean].\n\nThe entire process of Franco’s interviews show this, where he’s visibly poking fun at Wiseau - the person he was meant to portray and to really learn. The person he was supposed to empathize with. That was my biggest issue with his performance, and why I was relieved to hear of his Oscar snub. Sure, he may have pinned that laugh down (it’s not *that* impressive, if you notice how many imitate it at any of the thousands of midnight screenings of *The Room*), and sure he’s covered in prosthetics. Cross-referencing between the book and the movie, however, Franco is obviously laughing at himself for imitating so well. To be honest, it’s just another phoned-in biopic performance, standing beside a nepotistical decision of miscasting with Dave Franco that also destroys the other ethereal qualities of Sestero’s reminiscing (for those who remember the book, it's a running joke that everybody thought they were fucking.) \n\nGreg Sestero claimed in interviews that he was inspired to make *Best F(r)iends* after he saw an early cut of *The Disaster Artist*, which I find kind of passive aggressive, or, I hope it is. The film is split into two volumes, so having an accurate perspective on the whole is literally impossible at this point, but it’s very obvious from the start this is all a self-reflective allegory for Sestero; shifting the bizarre friendship of he and Wiseau into a labyrinth of absurdism that does everything *The Disaster Artist* avoided for the sake of picking up Franco his own Oscar. I wouldn’t be surprised if Sestero empathized with Wiseau after Franco’s film - because watching Wiseau here (and in interviews) and comparing them to Franco’s portrayal, it’s easier to see just how little empathy Franco had for his point-of-study. \n\nIt would be a surprise to say Tommy Wiseau is good here, but the film delivers a good performance through him by default. The screenplay allows Wiseau’s “style” (or lack thereof) to fit him in - and allow him to be kooky, improvisational, and chew up the scenery in a way that doesn’t feel forced. One of the key reasons for this is that, unlike *The Room*, everybody else in *Best F(r)iends* is constantly aware of how “bizarre” Wiseau’s character is (rather than speaking and behaving just like him.) \n\nThey make comments. They give him looks. In one scene, Sestero’s girlfriend asks: “where are you from?” - a question commonly asked by most when it comes to Wiseau’s “uninterpretable” accent. Wiseau stands there, seemingly surprised by the ridiculousness of the question, in that typical Wiseau way where he’s oblivious to his own eccentricities. He says with a dead-serious face: “Planet Earth” and proceeds with some misogynistic comments toward her (of which, fittingly, Greg later criticizes.)\n\nAny fans of the *The Room*, or those who have just seen it at least once, are going to pick up on all the subtexts here. Wiseau plays a creepy mortician, but inside his morgue exists a mantel of headshots featuring Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean, and all the other t-shirt Hollywood faces. There’s not much difference between this characterization and the personality of Tommy Wiseau. If there were, Wiseau wouldn’t work in-context to everything around him. \n\nIt’s also increasingly clever as the film goes on.\n\nAt the start, Sestero’s protagonist is mute and incapable of speaking, yet finds his voice when he first meets the Wiseau’s kooky creep. From there on out, he behaves similarly to his Mark character in *The Room*: very short sentences when he’s actually speaking, and staying quiet and off to the side when Wiseau’s chewing up the scenery and shitting it out in the best way he knows how. This blank slate works, weirdly enough, because Sestero is featured in the film as an L.A. antihero type. Even at one moment, him and his girlfriend watch *Sunset Boulevard* together, and almost like Sestero is worried that these small traits are going to be far from considered by an audience expecting full-in *The Room* style of humor, immediately brings up *Double Indemnity* (“god, I just love black and white movies.”) \n\nImagine you were watching *Rosemary’s Baby* (just as a random example, not a comparison of quality). Imagine you’re invested and curious about it, and then Rosemary learns she’s pregnant. Now imagine the film stopped there and you had to wait two months to finish it, and were expected to write a review on that first half you saw. That’s pretty much where I am here with *Best F(r)iends*. It’s 108 minutes of pure setup; and while criticism can be lowered onto the film for having stretched-out moments of mundanity and/or awkward conversation, I found myself smitten by it. It’s incredibly patient - and the digital cinematography enhances everything so personal about it. There's a sequence in Las Vegas that could've easily been cut, but it's here and it's possibly the most beautiful scene in it. \"She *died*?\" Wiseau screams in response to Greg's expositional backstory. But he then, in the ways only he could, says: \"don't worry about it, she's up there with the stars now\" - pointing up at the sky above the desert. \n\nThe film even switches between digital and film in one of many allusions to *The Room*; kind of illustrating the more forced references to the film as not simply “oh hai, remember this?” and more like “[Sestero’s] point of view [on this friendship] is so different from [Wiseau’s].” \n\nIn *The Disaster Artist*, James Franco was so false in his portrayal of Tommy, and Dave so much more energetic than Sestero’s own personality - and this caused the film to question the friendship. Wiseau can come off disorienting, but in that film’s case, it plays it up like a form of Stockholm Syndrome; no reality behind Dave’s performance to justify him staying friends, let alone joining him on a shared trajectory toward careers in the film industry. In *Best F(r)iends*, the subtext for Sestero is actually dense. There’s a reason he stays, and that’s because underneath this bizarre figure, he finds a lot to relate to. Not just based on interests, but also desperation. I mean, at the start, Greg is homeless. \n\nIf *The Room* has stuck Tommy and Greg side-by-side as an iconic buddy couple, then Sestero’s screenplay argues that it’s very similar to selling gold teeth from dead people and being stuck within only due to association. And, yes, everybody is aware of Tommy being weird - but everybody else is more curious as to why Greg wants to be around him in the first place. The problem is, Greg has nowhere else to go. Even with this film, ironically. (In a Reddit AMA with Wiseau, he claimed - and take this with a grain of salt along with *anything* the guy says, that he and Greg don’t really even talk much beyond their business endeavors.)\n\n*Best F(r)iends* wouldn’t work without Wiseau and Sestero in the lead roles. It wouldn’t work without Sestero being the writer. It follows convention structurally, but breaks them by simply having Wiseau loose on-screen. By the end of it, it comes off like Wiseau’s own mentality has crushed in on Sestero’s own vision. The final scene leaves you speechless by the sheer force of it being over-the-top shitty, but it seems to also come with a personal indictment on Sestero’s own level. \n\nBest friends, or fiends? Is there a difference? Apparently not in Los Angeles, at least for Greg Sestero - who accurately paralleled his trajectory with that of William Holden floating dead in Gloria Swanson's swimming pool.\n\n*\"I am redddy for the close-ahp, Mr. DeMeele.\"*",

There is a world of difference between these three scripts - separated by more than 6 decades, three different protagonists, three different lives and three different tones in which the scripts have been written. While Citizen Kane is a dramatic story that spans the life of a man whose life even though controversial was nothing less than great, both Annie hall and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind are romances with a dark comedic tone to them. Yet, there is a common thread that runs between them and the basic need of these three characters is to find love. All three characters try and make love or rather the one they love, perfect and fail miserably. There are structural similarities in the three scripts as well - All three have a non-linear structure and are a retracing of the lives of our three protagonists.\n[Full article](https://www.desicinephiles.com/editors-pick/an-analysis-of-non-linear-screenplays-from-three-different-eras)",
