        "text": "Hi! A little bit about me: I am a blind woman in the sciences. I have my undergraduate degree in neuroscience and am currently finishing my MS in biological sciences with a neuroscience focus. I will be graduating in May 2023 and have actively been looking for jobs, but am finding it extremely difficult. I had already anticipated these challenges given that, even with the EEOC and ADA in place to protect disabled people and make it illegal for us to be discriminated against in the hiring process, that still does not prevent discrimination from happening. I have applied to hundreds of jobs so far and have either not heard back or have not been selected. I have noticed that when I answer \"no\" to the disability question, I at least get emails saying the company has received my application and that it is being reviewed, but I don't know if that necessarily means anything.\n\nWhile I know being blind puts me at a disadvantage societally and especially in the job search, I also know I have drive and determination coupled with skills which can hopefully level the playing field for me. My degrees have developed many skills which are of value to employers. Some of my strengths include:\n\n·  Technical writing (scientific papers, literature reviews, research proposals)\n\n·  Presentation skills (giving scientific presentations to diverse audiences and adapting communication style)\n\n·  Interpersonal skills/teamwork (used both in the laboratory and as a Graduate Teaching Assistant)\n\n·  Problem-solving\n\n·  Critical thinking\n\n·  Adaptability\n\n·  Learning fast\n\n·  Organized\n\n·  Self-starting\n\n·  Attention to detail \n\n·  Data analysis\n\n·  Time-management\n\n·  Etc.\n\nGiven the above, what are some job options that would be suitable for me? I love science, but I would not be opposed to working in another field if my skills are beneficial there.\n\nSome things to note: screen readers like VoiceOver and tools like ZoomText on computers make almost everything accessible to the blind. I cannot drive, so I do not know how realistic a job in medical/pharmaceutical sales would be haha. I also have a guide dog, so any job which involves being in close proximity to hazardous chemicals/fumes would not be ideal. \n\nThank you for reading and for any feedback you can give!",

I know genetic mutations are relatively rare but what would the effects of the chromosomal damage look like over a span of a given time, would it appear faster or would the rate at which it appears not matter and all that Is changed is the fact that you're eventually going to, more than likely, form some cancerous mutation.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/11h9yl5/key_advantages_of_phage_display_in_drug_discovery/",
        "text": "Phage display technology is a powerful tool used in drug discovery to develop peptides and monoclonal antibodies that bind specifically with high affinity to a target molecule. The technique involves genetically engineering [bacteriophages](https://www.cellorigins.com/phage-display-bacteriophages) to display foreign peptides or antibodies on a viral coat protein to create a filamentous fusion phage. Phage display libraries are collections of such phages that typically contain 10\\^9-10\\^10 different phage clones, making them a powerful tool for screening and discovering new targeting molecules. Due to their flexible design and large-scale production capabilities, phage display libraries have become an important tool in the drug discovery process, allowing scientists to rapidly screen for potential new drug targets and candidate compounds. Additionally, phage display technology has been successfully employed in several other areas of scientific research, including immunology and protein engineering. Here we give a brief overview of the key advantages of phage display in drug discovery.\n\n## Phage Display is Highly Versatile\n\nPhage display can be used for a variety of applications at different stages in drug development including peptide and antibody discovery, drug candidate screening, and lead optimization. Additionally, phage display libraries can be screened using a variety of different [biopanning](https://www.cellorigins.com/biopanning) methodologies depending on the needs of the researcher. Biopanning involves iterative rounds of affinity selection against a target molecule, cell, or tissue to select phages that display peptides or antibodies with certain desired binding and pharmacokinetic characteristics. During biopanning, a phage library is exposed to the target molecule, and unbound or weakly bound phages are removed by washing, after which bound phage particles are collected by elution.\n\nPhage display biopanning is versatile because almost any [type](https://www.cellorigins.com/expressionsystems) of peptide or antibody library can be screened against any type of target. For in vitro biopanning experiments, the phage display library is typically affinity selected against recombinant proteins or other isolated molecules. This type of selection often results in the identification of high-affinity binders. However, many studies have shown that peptides and antibodies selected by in vitro phage display often fail to exhibit optimal binding in live tissues and whole organisms and demonstrate less-than-ideal pharmacokinetic properties. Instead, more researchers are recognizing that phage display selections against cells and tissues (in situ) and in live animals or patients (in vivo) offer advantages regarding the identification of ligands that show high binding affinity, minimal off-target binding, and optimal pharmacokinetics. This is especially useful when interrogating a complex biological process that cannot easily be replicated in vitro, such as differentially expressed target proteins of varying lengths and accessibility, as well as ones that have different binding partners depending on the tissue, as is often observed in normal vs. tumor tissues. At [Cell Origins](http://cellorigins.com/), we are pioneers in utilizing [multi-tier phage display techniques](https://www.cellorigins.com/cell-origins-pioneers-in-phage-display-technology) to develop peptides and monoclonal antibodies that show desirable binding kinetics and pharmacokinetics. Our platform ensures that lead compounds maintain their high binding affinity and specificity while having optimal pharmacokinetics and minimal off-target binding.\n\n## Phage Display is High Throughput\n\nThe phage display platform is highly efficient and can screen billions of different peptides or antibodies in a single day. This high throughput capacity makes phage display an attractive technology in drug discovery. Practically, this means that phage display selections can be used to screen large libraries in a matter of a few days and that attractive drug candidates can be identified in as little as a few weeks after next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic analysis have been completed. Furthermore, using filamentous phage to display desirable ligands offer the ability to screen and analyze candidates in a high throughput and cost-effective manner that is not possible with individual soluble peptides and antibodies. As such, recombinant DNA technology, rapid propagation in E. coli, and the development of easy tagging methods allow kinetic analyses to be carried out post-selection in a much more rapid manner. While the synthesis of peptide sequences and the production of monoclonal antibodies typically take weeks to complete, the production of phage for kinetic analyses can be carried out in a few days.\n\n## Phage Display is Cost-Effective\n\nPhage display screening is among the least expensive investigation techniques available for drug discovery. Compared with other technologies, phage display selections typically require fewer resources, reagents, and consumables while generating targeting ligands with high-affinity and desirable binding properties in a short amount of time. Additionally, phage libraries are known to be highly robust and can be stored for extended periods of time without a significant loss in infectivity and usability.\n\nThe cost-effectiveness and versatility of phage display technology allow the researcher to simultaneously interrogate several types of antibody and peptide libraries against potential biomarkers under different conditions. Such a multiplexing approach lowers the overall cost of drug discovery and further provides an opportunity to add additional levels of competition and complexity to the phage display selection to more rapidly generate ligands with optimal properties.\n\n## Summary\n\nPhage display provides a versatile and powerful tool to rapidly identify high-affinity ligands in a cost-effective manner. At [Cell Origins](http://cellorigins.com/), we are experts in phage display with extensive experience in generating peptides and antibodies that bind difficult and complex targets both in vitro and in vivo.

It occurs to me that this could be linked to the Coolidge Effect. If a mate does not produce offspring, the male will move to another female, while a fertile female producing children will have the pair bond strengthened.\n\nHas there been any research and what were the results?",

        "text": "Hey guys, this is my first post in this sub.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis might not be the right sub (I apologize if it isnt i dont know where else to post this) as I did not major in biology per se, but I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Science from a UK university. I achieved a 2:1 (not sure what the US equivalent is but its a decent mark). The reason I chose this degree was because I love science and had or have a passion for biology and was planning to enter the research field. Between 1st and 2nd year I started to question my decision to study this degree and studying abroad (I was an international student). I lost my interest in the subject and I was depressed a majority of my time in uni. After I graduated it hit me for the first time that the job market related to my degree is EXTREMELY small. Now, I kind of knew this before I enrolled at university but being a naive 17 year old at the time I thought that I should go for it anyway since it was my passion and that the job prospects for this degree could change in 4 years (I was wrong). In my final year of uni, I realized a job related to research might not be a good idea as I dont like labs (there are no jobs  for that here anyway). After graduating I started to brainstorm some positions I could apply for that are non-lab. I thought about being a clinical research coordinator, bioinformatician and even a patent lawyer. There are zero jobs for those in my country. I thought about being a medical sales representative but opportunities are limited. I applied for a few of those jobs and I either got rejected or no response. I even thought about working in quality control in pharma and in the food industry. There are no pharmaceutical manufacturers here and there a few companies in the food industry, to which I applied to and have gotten no response. The only jobs I can get here are teaching jobs and working as a medical lab technologist. I dont want to work as either but I started to accept that I cant do anything else, so I am currently studying to get my med tech license. I regret my entire uni experience. I utterly loathe myself and I cry to myself most nights dwelling on my uni experience and how the entire process of finding jobs is degrading. Every one I know has a job but me. I am starting to think I should have studied finance, business or CS because every time i go on linkedln or indeed, majority of jobs posted are related to these fields. I even applied to jobs that are not related to science and again, no response. Sorry if this post seems unstructured or confusing, but my brain is scrambled eggs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not sure what I am looking for by posting this. I guess I am just looking for comfort or advice. Should I study a different field that might give me a better chance of getting a job? I thought about getting an MBA or doing a CS degree. I am also considering taking a 3 month Data Analytics course at at a nearby college. I honestly dont know what do with myself. \n\nThank you for those who took the time to read this.",

Canine Pokemon, such as growlithe, vulpix, alolan vulpix, rockruff, and absol have been found to genetically evolve from the same common ancestor (A) of all Canine Pokemon. If the ancestor ( B ) of all vulpix and alolan vulpix had a mutation resulted in multiple tails while the ancestor ( C ) of all growlithe and rockruff had a mutation for a mane like tuft of fur at their neck (but not the multiple tails) would a grouping of vulpix, rockruff, and alolan vulpix, alongside Ancestor B be a Monophyletic, Polyphyletic or Paraphyletic grouping?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Four sequences of a gene in four Ghost Pokemon that allows for intangibility, or the ability to pass through solid objects, are given below. Based off the differences between the sequences, create a pairwise genetic distance matrix to build a possible neighbor joining tree where clades are represented by parentheses. List species alphabetically like, (AB)C)D).\n\n\nDuskull A T G G C A T \n\nDrifloon A A G A T A G\n\nHaunter A T G C T A T\n\nPolteageist G A C C T A C",

        "text": "My mother in law lives in California.  9 months ago she fell and was brought to the hospital.  Her care there was average imo but she basically ended up going from one facility to another because she is elderly and lives alone.  Along the way she was eventually diagnosed with a c. auris infection (colonization?) of her skin.  Because of several other issues she was basically left in a bed and the minimum of care was provided.  She no longer has the strength to walk and her current rehab center has not provided any physical therapy in over a month.  \n\nMy wife and I want to move her across the country to live with us.  We have a private room and bed available for her to live in and recover in.  I know we can supervise and provide better care for her here locally.  \n\nHer c. Auris infection was diagnosed 5+ months ago and she hasn't been retested (which might not be important as I know the current thinking is once you are colonized you are always colonized).  \n\nThe move would entail her flying 6+ hours with my wife to get here.  We have gone into excruciating detail when planning this trip to make sure she will arrive safe and healthy.  But when we discussed it with her current care facility they said that they wouldn't allow it, and they would report us to the CDC and department of public health if we attempted it.  They want her kept isolated in a bed alone, in a diaper, for basically the rest of her life.\n\nThe information on the CDC website is pretty scant when looking for advice on such a move, or travel in general with c. Auris.  They do a good job of painting it as doom and gloom, but at the same time recommend zero treatment if you have a noninvasive infection, and they say non infected people are safe to interact with colonized individuals as long as they take general extra precautions with cleaning their hands etc after interacting with them.\n\nAccording to the CDCs current heat map she is in the red zone a totally white zone.  We don't want to do anything that puts others at any sort of risk, but at the same time I don't want my mother in law to suffer like she has for the last 9 months.  Does anyone have any advice or similar experiences from which they can offer some advice?",

But what someone eats today could influence the health of not only their children but their grandchildren.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Kimberley Wilson, a psychologist with a master's degree in nutrition, looks back at the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944-45 and how it has revealed a fascinating insight into the surprising generational impact of poor nutrition. \n\n[The Famine Ended 70 Years Ago, but Dutch Genes Still Bear Scars](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/science/dutch-famine-genes.html)\n\n&gt;The Dutch Hunger Winter has proved unique in unexpected ways. Because it started and ended so abruptly, it has served as an unplanned experiment in human health. Pregnant women, it turns out, were uniquely vulnerable, and the children they gave birth to have been influenced by famine throughout their lives.\n\nMy understanding of epigenetics is from the perspective of  the Dutch \"Hunger Winter\" when the Nazis starved the Dutch of food. This led babies that were invitro during to naturally crave excess calories later in life. So it's clear if a baby is invitro during periods of starvation the body will respond to encourage it to search out extra sustenance once it is born.\n\nWould anyone here tell me other real-life examples of epigenetics notably impacting those who were invitro or raised during  (good or bad) unique periods?",
