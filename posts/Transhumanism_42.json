Are we doing all that we could so that other species that evolve on other planets wouldn't have an existence as fraught with danger as ours? What I mean is that potentially every species would eventually develop ways to interpret radio signals. I think we should have a system that constantly blasts various bits of super important knowledge as we make it in every direction and does so every so often for the next million or X # of million or billions of years. It would be so cool to think that while lets face it, humans are f'd bad... we aren't going to survive, we have screwed our planet too thoroughly and we dont have enough time to save it... BUT we may have enough time to develope some really cool technologies that we could then gift with the cosmos to help advance other species faster and hopefully explain to them the reasons why they should be kind to their brothers and not fight.",

You do not expect this to happen in your lifetime, but rather centuries from now. You take the long view that humanity will go this route, even though you personally will never see it. You're okay with this.\n\nBut I bet most of you are transhumanists because you personally expect to become immortal. You expect these technologies to advance quickly enough in your own lifetime so that you personally may get to benefit from them. Mind uploading, nanobots, anti-aging medicine, whatever. You think, or rather desperately hope, that it'll all fall into place before you die from aging. \n\nIt won't. Go ask any neuroscientist, geneticist, roboticist, or A.I. researcher. They'll all tell you how far away we are from even the most modest of these things. We are nowhere near nanobots. We are nowhere near curing aging or reverse aging. We are nowhere near mind-uploading, if its even possible in the first place. All of these things are the greater part of a century away, at best. You were frankly born too early. You get to grow old and die just like everyone else before you. Sorry.\n\nIt's fine to be interested in this topic, but I'm speaking to the people who think they are personally going to become transhuman in their lifetime. You ain't.

        "text": "How important, relevant, is fitness/exercise in the transhumanism community? We already know it slows aging, so why isn't there more emphasis on seeing whether we can do even more than just slow aging with exercise? Do people here experiment a lot with fitness/exercise? Gene therapy or transplanting consciousness in robots has it's place obviously. There are certainly possibly many paths to the same result. But for me, what good are those things if they are not likely to happen in this lifetime, if I can't take advantage of them right now to increase my health/vitality? \n\nEveryone has control right now of their body to experiment with and zero to far less control of the many other transhumanist technologies, options. Aubrey De Grey has certainly a well earned place in transhumanism, but I would think people that were actually physical specimens, examples of how aging can be slowed and what fitness systems they used to accomplish that would also be very useful to understanding, slowing, and maybe reversing aging. Does fitness/exercise, discussion of fitness/exercise systems have a place in transhumanism? If so, is it getting enough attention/focus/discussion? \n\nWith the evolution of fitness gadgets, I would think a lot of data sharing could take place to help figure out what fitness behaviors work best at slowing, reversing aging. We know things like heart rate variability and slow wave sleep decline as the body physically ages. Now that we have (or are close to having) mass market trackers for these variables we can share this data and see what sort of exercise behaviors result in the improvement of these variables. \n\nThoughts?",
