It is also a very \"democratic\" hoax, because nationalists (the first site is an ultra nationalist one) can use it as a point of pride, and people who hate their own heritage and language can use it to show just how \"shamefully complicated our grammar is\" and how we have a \"terrible, unlearnable language\".\n\nTypical bad linguistics, a big focus on grammatical cases (and I can do it the other way - if you concentrate on our phonetical pronounciation, someone can say we have the easiest language in the world, because we mostly write as we speak, but of course, both \"hardest\" and \"easiest\" claims are bullshit).\n\nI see Polish has a very similiar kind of hoax. Also, many reactions to this hoax were from Czechs and in the vein of \"no, Czech is the hardest!!!!!!\". What should have instantly tipped off anyone is how Croatian is listed among the \"easiest\" languages, even through it is a synthetic, inflected language with seven cases, and similiar to the point of limited mutual intelligibility (nothing like Czech, but I can generally understand at least the topic or the general stance of the speaker, and I can understand a Croatian language menu in a restaurant). So apparently, Slovak is THE hardest language in the world because SEVEN GRAMMATICAL CASES, yet Croatian is among the easiest... despite having the same number of grammatical cases. The best thing is, saying Slovak has \"7 grammatical cases\" is arguably wrong, as the vocative case is archaic and not really used anymore. So one of the \"easiest languages\" has actually more cases than Slovak.",
