        "text": "I'll be taking a family vacation this summer that'll include four coffee-drinking adults. Being a true vacation, I'd prefer to keep drinking good coffee each morning and not have to compromise too much on that. We have to fly to our destination, and we're staying in a condo with a full kitchen where we will eat most (if not all) of our breakfasts. The condo has a standard stove-top kettle, cheesy drip coffeemaker, and a microwave.\n\nAt home I brew 98% of the time with a V60, scale, gooseneck kettle, etc. And I have more manual brewing devices than I know what to do with. I'll likely bring my Lido 3 hand grinder on this vacation and will pick up some great locally roasted beans, but I'm trying to figure out a good way to brew. And that's where I'd like your recommendations. I've thought about buying a large metal French press for both durability and capacity, but obviously that'll take up a ton of space in a suitcase and I don't know if I'd ever use it after this trip (I prefer paper-filtered coffee). Should I bring my AeroPress Go and brew double-strength brew, then dilute the results to make two cups at a time, and just do that twice each morning? Are there other brewers that I should be thinking about that are easily portable that'll allow me to brew four cups at a time where I don't need a gooseneck kettle? \n\nAnother option for travel that I've used in the past is fancy instant coffee from Swift Cup or one of the roasters who contracts with them. But that would mean bringing a zillion packets or a huge bag of instant coffee with me. It works, but maybe isn't the first choice.\n\nOr should I just grind good beans, put them in the drip machine, and deal with whatever swill it produces from them?\n\nWhat do you think? Can you help me think outside the box? TIA.",

I also ground about 10-15 grams on this setting prior to this.\n\n- https://i.ibb.co/PTrdJF3/image.png\n\n- https://i.ibb.co/kgtLywb/image.png (separated fines by running through a strainer, about 50% fines, 50% coarse).\n\nTo me this seems a far cry from the ultra coarse grinds used for cold brewing, so I guess I couldn't even grind for that at all?\n\nAny insights?

How different companies source beans? About any other aspects of running or working for a coffee business? Well, ask your questions here! Think of this as an AUA directed at the back room of the coffee industry.\n\nThis may be especially pertinent if you wonder what impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the industry (hint: not a good one). Remember to keep supporting your favorite coffee businesses if you can - check out the weekly deal thread and the coffee bean thread if you're looking for new places to purchase beans from.\n\nIndustry folk, feel free to answer any questions that you feel pertain to you! However, please let others ask questions; do not comment just to post \"I am _______, AMA!” Also, please make sure you have your industry flair before posting here. If you do not yet have it, contact the mods.\n\nWhile you're encouraged to tie your business to whatever smart or charming things you say here, this isn't an advertising thread. Replies that place more effort toward promotion than answering the question will be removed.\n\nPlease keep this thread limited to industry-focused questions. While it seems tempting to ask general coffee questions here to get extra special advice from \"the experts,\" that is not the purpose of this thread, and you won't necessarily get superior advice here. For more general coffee questions, e.g. brew methods, gear recommendations for home brewing, etc, please ask in the daily Question Thread.",

        "text": "Has anyone had this problem before? I’m not looking for medical advice just a little empathy and decaf suggestions, but ergo. Almost 2 months ago I was drinking around 600ML of coffee a day, 300 in the morning 300 in the afternoon, 17:1 ratio when out of nowhere I started getting instant migraines. I initially assumed this was because of my water intake but I try to drink a gallon a day as I have a huge hydroflask. \n\nThis persisted for 2 weeks and it just got so bad that I decided to cut it out. I started drinking caffeinated tea to ween myself off and found that if I tried to transition back to coffee the migraine would return, and yet black tea, green tea, and mate would be fine. \n\nSince then I’ve been so scared to have a cup since the pain essentially lasts all day, renders me useless, and pain meds just become a short temporary solution. My partner is lucky since I still enjoy making a nice pour over as a ritual but since I have been avoiding drinking it myself it goes to him. \n\nI don’t know why this sudden sensitivity has happened and part of me is wondering if I did it to myself. I was a barista for 5 years at various shops ranging from bottom of the barrel “we reuse old coffee in our ‘coffee ice cubes’ drive through to craft coffee “we roast everything in house and all of our baristas are IBICA registered”, but either way still pounding coffee like it’s no one’s business and a tolerance that was hard to manage at times and I’m not a huge person, like 5’0 120lbs lol.\n\nI miss the taste and have been looking into decaf beans but I’m pretty picky since my craft days and don’t want to waste the money. The tea is okay for now, but if anyone has any suggestions on good decaf or similar experiences I’d love to get your thoughts!",

Aside from the main exterior cylinder polish, it looks like they took them straight off the machine tools before assembly and shipping; it arrived complete with machine oil (telltale smell and oily residue) and metal flakes/chips in various parts of it. Slightly annoying but whatever -- so I disassembled it as much as I could, cleaned it with rice and rubbing alcohol, and then once finished, ran a test-run of more rice through it...but metal flakes kept coming out. Needless to say, it's going back.\n\nAny suggestions? Do I need to step up my budget to something like Orphan Espresso Lido or Pharos?\n\nTIA",

I know that wet process can taste a bit like a mix of papaya and wet garbage, bit it gives an interesting flavor.\n\nInstead of having crappy instant coffee, I decided to try to get some better stuff (because sometimes I'm lazy or I want boozy coffee).  Folgers and American Nescafe tastes burnt, bitter, and not like coffee that I'm used to.  I've liked Cafe Bustello Instant Espresso, but I can't find it anymore around here.  Nescafe Clasico (from Latino stores) is OK, but weak in flavor.\n\nThe Nescafe Azera Intenso tastes like real brewed coffee.  It even has some real coffee fines in there, so you have that authentic bottom of the mug mud (and a bit of texture in the liquid too).  I would compare it to a drip cup of coffee from Starbucks - maybe McDonalds if you put too much water in it.  \n\nI think my search is complete - now I have my house instant coffee for the surprise visitors.

Stir thoroughly.\n\nSteep on counter 36-48 hours. Stir 3-4 times during steeping. \n\nPress into mason jar, yields ~3 cups. Store in fridge for up to a week. \n\nI cut the coffee ~50\\50 with water. Boiling if I want hot coffee. This method works well for me. I think it tastes good and gives me a week's worth. I also like the lower acidity of cold brew versus hot.

        "text": "Hey guy’s I recently bought the Tru 15 bar pump espresso machine,  it’s my first time using an espresso machine! ( I bought a beginner machine I know) but my espresso doesn’t come out foamy or espresso “like” at all, it comes out as if it were regular coffee. I’m using Starbucks espresso roast coffee in the machine, any suggestions on what I can do? Or if I’m doing something wrong?? Anything helps!",

I'm aware both are capable of Filter and Espresso, it would be used for espresso and v60, maybe some aeropress and french press every now and then. Thanks!",

        "text": "Hello fellow coffee enjoyers.\n\nSo i just bought a Moka Pot to make Iced Americano's at home. I know that it doesn't produce a real espresso but people in this sub-reddit advised me to buy one before buying a fully automatic espresso machine.\n\nMy problem is i have no idea on which ratio should i use to make a decent espresso shot. I bought a 6 Cup Moka Pot, and people on web suggest that i should use nearly 30 grams of coffee with it. When i tried to fill the chamber with coffee it didn't take more than 25 grams i suppose. I made it quite tight to squeeze all the coffee in. Then i added 10 oz of boiling water in the lower chamber. When it was finished i added 10 oz of hot water to it and divided all into two big cups.\n\nI know that it was my very first try, but the resulting 'thing' was...... disgusting. It had a strange/burnt taste. But not in a good way.\n\nCan you guys suggest me some basic things about using this device and making decent americanos at home? What ratios (water/coffee) are you using yourself? My my aim is making decent coffees that resembles Iced Americano of Starbucks. \n\nSo how much coffee and how much water should i use in this 6 Cup Moka Pot? Since i will use this pot only for one person (myself) Is this type of Moka Pot suitable for me?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n(I used Starbucks Blonde Roast coffee btw. I bought it today and they grinded it for me at the store, so it is freshly grinded and in it's best condition).",

Aesthetics are somewhat important, but budget is consideration given that these items only tend to last a few years.\n\nWhile shopping Amazon recommended a number of Stagg knockoffs that look about as good as the Stagg, for about 1/3 the price-- brands like Polivar or Paris Rhone.\n\nWhat is the advantage of the Stagg over these? I assume that the knockoffs are going to die in a few years but honestly 1/3 the price makes that a lot easier to swallow and boiling water isn't exactly a precision art.",
