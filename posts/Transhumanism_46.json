        "text": "Hi there! I'd love to know how you think transhumanism may affect our dream recall, and how in turn this may affect transhumanism itself.  \nFor example, I've already seen a few succesful experiments in translating brain imagery onto a computer screen. If this eventually evolved into an actual video recording of our dreams, it could mean \"total dream recall\".  \nNow, one of the reasons we tend to forget our dreams is because they show us repressed content from the unconscious. Often the stuff we forget is precisely the dreams that remind us of our fears, of desires we don't want to accept, etc. Once we remember them, we start being able to face them...but psychoanalysis can only do this at a drop-feed speed, probably because it would be traumatic otherwise.  \nSo what happens if technology allows us to see all of our dreams every day on a screen, no filtering, no censoring. The full package of repressed fears and desires. In the tradional case of drip-feed psychoanalysis, the facing of these thoughts and emotions sparks a change in the person. Often maybe the person had been engaging in a life-style that was just a defense mechanism. Once the unconscious threat has been exposed, the whole life-style of that person changes. Maybe, in the classic Freudian sense, they were living a life centered around their father or mother. Once this is revealed, they may change their life path totally.  \nSo could that happen on a mass, collective scale through the merging of technology with our psyche? That the whole quest of modern progress could be turned upside down? I'm genuinely interested in transhumanism and feel it's going down a positive path, but to spark a debate, I'll ask: could it be that the drive and desire that seems to push transhumanism forward (for example, a desire to elimiate death, etc), could that desire change once its unconscious roots are revealed by dream-capturing video tech?  \nSo the fascinating question is: will transhumanism dissolve itself by the very nature of facilitating a conscious awareness of the collective unconscious? I'm not saying \"we'll go back to square 1\", on the contrary: that maybe the transhumanist quest is very real, and will provoke a very real and drastic change in humanity, but maybe that change has less to do with the technology, and more with the change of mind and change of attitude it may provoke in us by clearing up all our hidden complexes?  \nI'd love to see other points of view on this topic. Thank you for reading this far! :) ",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/35c9qh/lifetimes_infinity_seeking_cofounders_indefinite/",
        "text": "**Introduction**\n\nI started /r/Digital_Immortality and [Lifetimes Infinity](http://www.lifetimesinfinity.com) (LI) a year and a half ago with the intent of eventually shifting it into a business. I have enough time now that I can now make that shift. [The mission of LI is to constantly seek to increase the chances of individual and collective survival in the manner we think best facilitates indefinite life](http://www.lifetimesinfinity.com/index.php/about/mission-statement). The long term goal is to create a two-way brain-computer interface and an artificial brain. Together, these two things will allow us to upload our minds to outlive our human bodies. LI will be a business that develops technologies building toward mind uploading, leveraging these into products that will fund our operations, research, and growth.\n\n**Co-founder Search**\n\nI am looking for co-founders, supporters, advisors, mentors, and anyone that just wants to talk or help me to getting LI going, but mostly co-founders. We will establish exactly what the organization's plan of action is and explore all options for funding. I have already drawn up potential roadmaps and products, but there are still some challenges I have been struggling with since the conception of LI.\n\nRight now I'm only looking for co-founders in the **Bay Area**.\n\nSkills/traits I am looking for in a co-founder at this point in time:\n\n* A passion for indefinite life / substrate independent minds\n* Experience / knowledge in neuroscience\n* Experience with / knowledge of brain-machine interfaces (or related skills/knowledge, such as, but not limited to, electrical engineering, computer engineering, and electronics fabrication)\n* A desire to learn more deeply about one or multiple [areas of cognitive science](https://books.google.com/books?id=b4SE3C8PYU0C&amp;pg=PA523&amp;lpg=PA523&amp;dq=subdomains+of+cognitive+science&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M4CNo5m6_I&amp;sig=-frp_BGR1aMGD0v67mtEyqOQYIw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OqZEVeG2LMeLoQSdoYGQAw&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=subdomains%20of%20cognitive%20science&amp;f=false)\n\n\nSkills/traits I am looking for in future team members:\n\n* Experience in / knowledge of the field of artificial brains\n* Experience / knowledge in the fields of cognitive science more relevant to artificial brains (artificial intelligence, psychology, philosophy, linguistics, anthropology)\n\nI swiped this from someone else, but it is exactly what I want to say:\n\n&gt;[\"As co-founder and CTO of the start-up you will think along with me on all strategic decisions that need to be made from the absolute start onwards. You co-decide on the [first product(s)], the next hiring rounds, the IT infrastructure etc. We share responsibility. Previous start-up experience is not necessary as long as you like to be challenged and are able to cope with the uncertainty associated with being a founder.\"](http://www.stijnvanlieshout.com/co-founder-job-description/)\n\nIf you are interested in being a co-founder, I will write up a more detailed job description for you to look over (still working on it), or we can draw one up together if you're into that.\n\n**More About Lifetimes Infinity**\n\nLifetimes Infinity isn't going to be a typical business. Usually you would find a product and build a business around that, rather than defining an end goal and building a company and products to reach that goal. As such, it's been difficult figuring out what route to take in order to get started, and ultimately, in order to get where we want to be. I still don't entirely know, so I'm hoping that you believe in the mission of LI enough that you want to help me build this into a business. I've taken a lot of inspiration from Elon Musk, as his two latest companies (SpaceX and Telsa) have been built in order to reach goals rather than just in order to have a business.\n\n&gt;\"Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable transport.\" \"SpaceX Mission Statement: To enable the space flight capabilities necessary to make human life multiplanetary - or more specifically enable a self sustaining human civilization on Mars.\"\n\nUltimately, we will be developing technologies in both brain-machine interfacing and artificial brains, but we will start with brain-machine interfaces. The reason for this is that compared to artificial brain technology, it has a shorter product development cycle and there are better established markets for it.\n\n**About Me**\n\nI currently live in Portland, Oregon. I will be moving to the bay area in June, 2015. I'm a little bit of everything right now. I have been and will continue to prepare myself to be able to manage operations in the distant future while also providing essential skills while the organization is just getting started. At different stages of my life I have been drawn to the various areas of cognitive science. I have knowledge/experience in most of the areas of cognitive science. I don't have any formal education in any of these (although I did go to university for a while studying biology), and I lack significant depth in some of the skills we need to get started. However, I am very passionate about LI, and have organized my life around my dedication to indefinite life. Since I started LI, I have learned a lot about cognitive science and what I need to know for building and running a business. I still have a long way to go, but I love learning all of this. I can confidently guarantee you that I will never stop learning for and working on indefinite life, whether that is with Lifetimes Infinity or elsewhere.\n\n&gt;“You never fail until you stop trying.” ~Einstein\n\nI am happy to take on any job that Lifetimes Infinity requires me to do, but I will be filling the role of CEO (I like [this description](http://www.steverrobbins.com/articles/ceojob/), although, starting out I plan to be much more involved in R&amp;D until we have enough people that I can delegate most of that work).\n\n---\n\n**Get Involved**\n\nIf you agree with the vision of the organization and want to be a part of it at some point, pm me and I'll give you my email and Skype so we can get chatting (even if you don't live in the Bay Area), and let me know what skills you have to offer and how you would like to be involved with Lifetimes Infinity (co-founder, community member, advisor, ...). Alternatively, fill out the form [here](http://www.lifetimesinfinity.com/index.php/join/co-founder). I cannot offer anyone any money at this point, so we'll have to figure out what other option you want to go for or whether you want to wait for a paid position down the road.",

These gangs and leeches who feed off of other's sadness and bad people and other need to be punished and don't deserve to feel emotions at all(at least until we figure out how to kill of the evil over-bullying parts of the brain). MDMA, propranolol right after trauma, and other technologies that eliminate bad emotions related to sad memories are more effective than \"remembering and feeling\" the trauma as the remembering and feeling that crap constantly only strengthens the sadness of the memory and the bad memory itself more. We might not even be that far off from a \"selective forgetting pill\" that eliminates the bad memory and the sadness associated with it. Equilibrium will not be used on the good people, only on the bad ones. It also means less crowded jails or executions and more neutrals. It also means that the bad people who had their emotions neutralized with daily equilibrium will not commit evil crimes. \nMany people will argue about the \"ethics\", but let's see these people make it one year in a really tough neiborhood and then see how much their \"ethics\" argument holds. It is literally shocking that some people rather the world be plagued by crime than by technology, neutrality, kindness, peace, and other good things. It would be one big \"ethics battle\" though if equilibrium exist, but they're the ones stopping people from killing off the evil parts. \n",
