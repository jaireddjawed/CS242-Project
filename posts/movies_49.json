        "text": "Hi all. The other day I re watched Interstellar and I was surprised with the amount of propaganda in the film and story. Some examples:\n\n\\- Lots of flags of certain country everywhere through out the movie\n\n\\- Minor league baseball games next to a corn field in a ring-shaped space station\n\n\\- The white mans burden (Kipling) theme is essential to the story.\n\nDo you thing the director Nolan did this on purpose? For me it actually ruined the aesthetic of the movie a bit. What do you think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is an article analyzing this:\n\n[https://theconversation.com/interstellar-is-a-dangerous-fantasy-of-us-colonialism-34327](https://theconversation.com/interstellar-is-a-dangerous-fantasy-of-us-colonialism-34327)",

        "text": "Well, with only days left for the Oscars, we all can agree with the fact that RRR got snubbed big time in the Best Foreign Film Category, even though I believe All right on the western front would have had a higher chance, RRR deserved atleast a nomination. \n\nSo here comes my question, did you guys really enjoy RRR for what it was, did you find it as a True cinematic ride like Avatar, T2 or some old classic chinese action adventures, or does it fall into your category of \"It was so Bad, that it ended up being Good\"\n\nCause here in India, as of right now it will be shocking to you but there are many people who are criticizing RRR and calling it \"oVeRaTeD\", as they believe that it is just another mindless action movie, which got unnecessary love from you folks\n\nPS: Our film association is a freaking joke, every year they send \"Poverty Porn\" movies as we like to call it to the academy. For instance this year they send a movie called \"Chello Show\" as the official entry for our country, which is a remake of the classic **Cinema Paradiso** and you guys wanna hear the reason the stupid ass President of the committee gave, \"We wanted to send a movie that represented India in a different light\".",

        "text": "Whaddup erryone!?\n\nI am on a journey of analysing the history of movies and ive come accross this perceived phenomenon, though it cant be completely generalized:\n\nI feel like the older a movie is, the more it seems \"bad\" from an acting perspective. Sure, there are some exceptions were even with 60 year old movies, but by and large it seems like the further back something was filmed the goofier it becomes. I'm sure a large amount of this is because of the history of theater and over the top acting and pronouciation and the evolution towards \"realism\" in dialogue and delivery, but on some level it seems like good actors have just gotten \"better\" over time. As in: the standard and leading edge level of realisitic performance steadily raises itself up over the decades. \n\nThink of the deliveries of old movies the like of Casablanca or even the original Star Wars trilogy, where performances and dialogue may have been top notch at the time, but compared to some modern works they seem just amateurish. I still appreciate them, but i see many flaws in them that stem from them not knowing better at the time or just being expected differently back then compared to now. Certain films made in the last 10-20 years just seem much more sophisticated from a realistic perspective. You know what i mean?\n\nSo is there some film theory term or psychological theory or concept that describes one of those perceptions?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThx.",

I can imagine how awesome an experience it would have been to see it with full scale visuals and audio. It's a film that requires patience and suspension of disbelief. The plot is pretty simple in that there is no real plot that conveys a story. A woman wakes up because she hears a strange noise. She employes a sound engineer to help her replicate that sound, she has dinner with her sister and experiences auditory hallucinations of that sound, she travels south and meets a fish scaler and they have conversations about memory and dreams. There is a huge twist ending that just makes sense upon reflection. It's a beautiful film that will endure. I've heard it compared to 2001 A Space Odyssey and I get it.",

Still love the performances and cinematography but if I was an 8 or 9 after first viewing, I'd give it like a 6 or 7 after my rewatch.\n\nWhat movie gave you a similar experience where you were very high on it at first and then cooled down upon a rewatch?",

        "text": "As much as I love movies I also like to get hyped up or deciding that a movie is worth going to a theater by watching the trailer. I remember watching the trailer for the movie about time and getting so hyped up. The movie didn’t disappoint either. But sometimes a trailer is just good at being a trailer and not representing the movie case in point life itself. Before I give this movie shit I wanted to make sure that my friends got the same idea too and watching the trailer makes you think that this movie is all about Oscar Isaac and Olivia wild’s character with some other stories blended in. I cannot express my disappointment to see that the movie isn’t nothing like the trailer promised it to be. First of compliments to the guy who made the trailer it was beautiful and brilliant. It promised to be a movie about the ups and downs of life that a couple and their kid goes through which , and I cannot stress this enough, isn’t. 90% of the trailer is about them but I can’t confidently say they are in the movie for the 10%. \n\nNow why am I saying this now you ask? Because I saw the trailer for antman quantumania and they just straight up show you a clip from the end fight scene where Scott says ‘I don’t have to win, we both just have to loose’   Now, I get that they might have added this to emphasize how any man is way out of his league on this one and try to paint Kang as a more powerful character than just a random throwaway mcu villain but that isn’t a trade worth making imo. On the other extreme we have Babylon which the trailer did a disservice to the actual movie by not telling us what the story is about and just by showing a flashy period piece trailer. But then again I’d rather see a vague trailer and see the movie out of curiosity rather than going to the cinema expecting a movie and getting an hour Power Nap. That’s just me though",

Many people compare it to _Alice in Wonderland_ but other than the fact that the main character enters a crazy fantasy world, there’s really nothing else much in common.\n\nStarting with the obvious, the whole theme of Spirited away revolves around work, growth and the compassion of a child. Alice in Wonderland explores the things children are exposed to like riddles, games, story morals etc.\n\nMoving to characters, you can’t even draw parallels between characters at all. If someone can, please tell me in the comments.\n\nLewis Carroll made everything all nonsensical on purpose to illustrate the creative mind of a child and I’m pretty sure all the fantasy in Spirited Away is to bring in the element of Japanese culture.",

They lean left, have a very high level of empathy and conscience and are very heavily into social justice. \n\nMany if not all of these women also identify as queer/not straight and reject cis-heteronormative ideals of romance and distrust relationships where gender roles are prominent. \n\nI don't think these women will find the workaholic, hustle-to-get by, straightlaced guys that interesting. \n\nMaybe they will find such men too boring, too basic for their taste. \n\nThey will very likely feel these guys have some problematic views. \n\nThey probably won't see eye to eye on economic policies either. \n\nEven if the guy is not necessarily a Republican or politically conservative and identify as  sort of liberal even then I think the relationship may not last long coz these men and women may have very different idea of a great relationship and personal values. \n\nExample : Elon Musk and Grimes. \n\nWhat do yall think?",

I think it was a British movie from 70s and I believe i saw it on the Disney Channel. I have already tried 'Escape to Witch Moutain' which I don't think that's it but it could've been a knock off movie or something.\n\nThis is the best of recollection of certain scenes:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* It involved a little white, blonde boy about the age of 12...I think his name was Barnabe. Someone was named Barnabe  \n* There was a scene where it looked like there was a storm happening in his closet when he opened the door.\n* There was a scene where a boy (main character or not) reaches into a wooden kitchen table and the table morphs into a clay- like substance and creates a hole in the center of the table as he does this. He then pulls out a wooden figurine from the center of table like magic. \n* I remember there was a scene at the end where the boy is walking with a lady, and he talks about he no longer has the powers he does but somethings he can do. I remember this quote ' You're going to have a baby girl and name is Emma'.  I know these names were in the movie. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like this is a lot to remember but I can never find anything when I google it. Does this movie sound familiar to anyone else?",
