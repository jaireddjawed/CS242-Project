The \"ok\" light for temperature goes off really fast while brewing the coffee and the coffee temperature seems always a bit lower than expected... Also, the steamer is not so good. In addition, pressurized filters seem to make useless any attempt for an improvement.\n\nSo... I have the possibility to return and get a refund.\nWhat alternative would you consider, should you buy a machine with about the same budget (or slightly more expensive)?\n\nThanks a lot in advance!",

But I've been spending too much money at my local specialty coffee store lately, and have been itching to buy some of their beans to brew at home. I've been talking about getting a hand grinder, and using my hand-me-down french press to start my coffee journey in the new year.\n\nExcept my birthday just passed and my boyfriend's mother, having caught wind of my coffee dreams, bought me a Mr. Coffee electric blade grinder for my birthday. She is very sweet, and she really didn't have to get me anything at all, so I'm very touched! I don't want to hurt her feelings but the grinder is really...crappy. It's a two prong blade (that's somehow \"permanently lubricated\"??) and, most of all, isn't washable. There's a detachable lid that's washable, but the actual basin of the grinder, and the blades, cannot be washed. The manual only allows it to be wiped with a damp cloth.\n\nI'm concerned that this is going to lead to cross-contamination of flavours. I've had spice grinders with this issue. I used it for cumin once, and everything that comes out of that will forever have the cumin stain.\n\nIs there anything about this Mr. Coffee grinder that's salvageable? Am I mistaken in my thinking? Will it make halfway decent coffee? Can I possibly use it for something else? \n\nMy boyfriend has suggested taking the hit for me and telling his mom that he gave the wrong gift suggestion, but now I just feel like a bit of an ungrateful twat. I don't want to make either my boyfriend or his mom feel any worse. But I live in a small apartment where space is limited, and I don't really want to have something that's just going to take up space and collect dust. \n\nPlease help!",

I've ordered some Moccamaster #4's but is there a generally agreed gold standard for this machine? I'm coming from using a V60 where I've kept it simple and just purchased Hario 02 filter paper. In contract, the range of options/brands with the SPB is vast, and Sage don't actually specify what kind of paper will fit in their baskets. \n\nOn the topic of the V60, Sage does sell a pourover adapter kit, does anyone use this and is it worth getting? It does sound appealing to just plug in my current V60, but again, Sage don't specify what pourover brands and sizes are compatible and it is very rarely reviewed in any real depth.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I usually froth it and then add coffee to it, and no matter what recipes/syrups I add or try it with it just tastes so weird. It has a kind of chalky/stale aftertaste to it and usually people use and highly recommend this milk. I also use Chobani oat and cant remember if the same thing happens with that one. But the Oatly regular and also barista versions end up just tasting weird to me to the point I dont think it pairs well with coffee to me. Has anyone else experienced this? What other plant based milks are people using that they enjoy? Thanks",

        "text": "Hear me out. \n\nI own a small business gourmet coffee shop that is considered high volume. We have all the amenities of the big guys including large, self ordering kiosks, and a POS system where you can have your order taken by a human if you don't like kiosks. We have custom digital menu boards for ease of viewing and decision making, a very decent breakfast menu and 4 lunch sandwich options that will fill you up. We also pride ourselves on being a shop where you can bring the kids and offer awesome smoothies, frappes, and milkshakes. \n\nOur menu is designed in such a way where you can get nearly any (non-specialty) breakfast item and a large (non- seasonal) coffee for 9.99, and it will be in your hands within 1 minute (and some change) from the time you order. \n\nWe sell between 300 and 600 items at our shop per day, depending on the day. I have 4 full time professional baristas making about 19 an hour after tips are factored in and 2 part time baristas making about 17.00 after tips. We also are adamant on giving the customer the clear option to choose 0% as a tip versus feeling obligated to leave one (we want to earn it, not force it) \n\nWe have a dedicated customer base and a digital loyalty program that is as competitive as any available anywhere. \n\nAs an owner I make any where between 4,700 and 5,500 per month, plus quarterly bonus amounts which depend on sales. In the next year, all of my debt obligations are cut about 60 percent. I match our employees gas each week by splitting their driving costs and add it in their check as reimbursable. All employees get 5 dollars to spend each day at my shop, they are often rewarded for their work, and we always incentivize them if they pick up a shift or go above and beyond. I can't offer some of the options Starbucks does, but we are always adding more value to our team and its something that is a priority as we continue to grow. \n\nWhy am I telling you this? \n\nBecause the average price of my large drinks comes out to 4.72 cents (20oz hot and 24oz iced respectively) I understand for some this is extremely cheap and for others it is incredibly expensive but for my area I think it's perfect. I understand people charge more based on necessity, cost of good, labor, and other factors, which I am happy to buy when I'm traveling. I'm also involved with my shop about 2 days per week, I have a great management team in place and I am free to work on other projects and make money outside the coffee shop, something that took me 2 years to achieve. \n\nRecently, however, we were nervous about our .15 cent price increase on some of our drinks, that is until Starbucks decided to actually be very public about their impending increases which would be the third such increase in a YEAR. Our 16 ounce drinks average to 4.10, Starbucks just down the street averages 6.00 or more for the same sized drink. \n\nLike Subway, Starbucks suffers from mass expansion and incredible competition. It doesn't mean they can't win markets over, but it is increasingly difficult. For example, a local Subway fell victim to a local sub-shop charging nearly double the price as a subway sub, but they made their bread by hand, used almost a pound of meat, and the value was incredible as was the taste and customer service...Subway cannot compete with that even though the other shop charges more. Similarly, but in an opposite way, Starbucks continues to charge more than many mom and pop shops WITHOUT providing more value. \n\nWhen you come to my shop, your drink tastes as good as it looks. It is dressed to purposefully make you want to show it off on social media, and you are treated like you belong there. We also take a zero sum political stance and assume everyone that comes into out shop wants to escape the bullshit and be left alone from politics, opinions, and bad news. We keep it positive, non political, and we give you immense value for each order. \n\n\"You can't compare your business to Starbucks though, plus, why would this mean they're going to end up in a rapid decline?\" \n\nYou're right, I can't. I'm just one person with a business. Let's take Dutch Bros for example. If you don't like the taste, you sure as hell like the vibe a lot more, and dutch bros customer service blows Starbucks out of the water 9 times out of 10. \n\nStarbucks is charging astronomical prices for products they get cheaper than absolutely anyone in the industry and in the world for that matter, bought in bulk times a million, and they're serving a rather average product at astronomical prices that seem to be ever increasing. \n\nStarbucks is seeing some serious market push back having closed 424 stores in 2022 with executives saying there will be many more. \n\nAnd YES they did open 449 NEW stores in 2022, but consider the cost of shutting down all those stores tacked onto the cost or opening new ones, and consider how many of the new ones will eventually end up closing. Starbucks, like Subway, is throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks and it is opening MASSIVE doors of opportunity to up-and-coming chains that do what they do better, more efficiently, tastier, cheaper, with a better vibe or processes. Not only thay but when products at multiple starbucks result in different tastes and experiences, it is easy to be turned off to the mass corporate movement. \n\nThey are over-saturating themselves as well as out-pricing their drinks well beyond inflation....inflation which is affecting them a hell of a lot less considering they virtually own their supply chain. \n\nHow can Starbucks keep up in the long term, especially in a competitive industry where 20 dollars cannot get two people a drink and food in the morning? They have become aggressively greedy under the guise that it's to fund employee benefits or good-will expeditions. \n\nMy prediction for the next decade is an explosion of 4th wave coffee houses that provide astronomical value, processes and customer service, with a Starbucks company that won't be able to control the bleeding eventually. Sure they might always be around, but their dominance won't be there. Instead of seeing them in every Target, grocery store and corner, you'll see them in just one of those places as they are challenged by competitors. \n\nInterested in hearing your opinions on this but I've done a lot of research into their business and structure, profits and news and I feel as though the writing is on the proverbial wall, they're just blind to it as they throw shit at the wall and see what stores stick, just as Subway did in their prime",

Couple of years ago my wife bought a food processor with an included blade grinder unit and I tried it a couple of times, but it was a hassle so I didn't really stick with it.\n\nThen, about a month ago, YouTube recommended me Wired's Coffee Support with James Hoffman, and I fell down the rabbit hole. fast forward a month, and I bought myself a Wilfa grinder, an AeroPress and some decent beans (not specialty yet), and I made the best cup of coffee I've ever made at home.\n\nThe thing is, I hadn't searched anything coffee related in a long time, yet I was recommended the video.

I don't mind using the hand grinder a couple times a week, but it gets annoying on days  where I'm doing multiple rounds of coffee.\n\nCoincidentally, for christmas, I got a bag of ground coffee. I've been using that so it won't go stale, and the difference isn't as bad as I thought it'd be. There isn't nearly as much residue left in my mocha machine compared to either home grind method and it's faster/more convenient.\n\nThen again, my sense of smell fluctuates due to some medical issues, so, I figured I'd ask people who aren't smell-disabled for when mine gets back on track. What's your preference? A pre-ground with a decent grinder or a recently ground with a shit grinder?",

Recently we tried starbucks beans again and the difference was so stark, where it seemed like the starbucks beans were producing coffee so light it seemed like cream and hot water. I know this is not a coffee machine issue since it’s the same machine we’ve used forever where I once used to enjoy starbucks’ beans..could it be an inconsistency on their end?

The ‘3m future’ price is the price to have to have coffee delivered in three months (“3m’).\n\nWhile strike prices for are reasonably stable, the futures prices have slipped considerably - driven by good weather all over the world and in particular in Brazil where there have been concerns.

        "text": "Hey guys, sorry for the long post. I've recently started taking a liking to proper espresso for the last month or so now. I currently own an automatic Delonghi Magnifica S which served me well when I didn't really care too much about coffee but now that I've learned a lot, I think it's time to move on. The only problem is, I've learned so much I'm now overwhelmed.\n\nMy mind automatically just goes straight to \"you need the best otherwise it'll suck\" but I'm trying to tell myself \"will I even taste the difference between X and Y?\"\n\nThese are pretty much everything I've been looking lately. All priced in Australia.\n\nAll-in-one machines:\n\nBreville Barista Express - $650\n\nBreville Barista Pro - $900\n\nBreville Barista Touch - $1,400\n\nBreville Oracle (Sesame) - $2,000\n\nBreville Oracle (Stainless) - $2,300\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nStandalone machines;\n\n\nBreville Bambino Plus - $500\n\nGaggia Classic Pro - $700\n\nBreville Dual Boiler - $1,000\n\nRancilio Silvia V6 - $1,200\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nHopper style grinders:\n\n\nBreville Smart Grinder Pro - $280\n\nBaratza Sette 30 - $390\n\nEureka Mignon Manual - $490\n\nBaratza Sette 270 - $500\n\nEureka Mignon Silenzio - $600\n\nEureka Mignon Specialita 55 - $700\n\nBaratza Sette 270Wi - $730\n\nBaratza Vario+ - $825\n\nBaratza Vario W+ - $955\n\nEureka Mignon Magnifico - $970\n\nMahlkonig X54 - $1,000\n\nEureka Mignon Oro XL - $1,080\n\n\nSingle dose grinders:\n\n\nVaria VS3 - $600 (single)\n\nFellow ODE Gen2 - $700 (single)\n\nEureka Mignon Zero - $800 (single)\n\nDF64 - $625 (single) [standard version direct]\n\nEureka Oro Mignon Single Dose - $1,070 (single)\n\nNiche Zero - $1,080 (single)\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nI'd ideally like to keep my budget on the lower end of a thousand if possible.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "I'm in the market for a new coffee scale. I've looked into the smart scales, but I have no interest in dealing with apps, and I don't want to have to pay extra for a bunch of features I don't use. I've been using an Escali Primo, but it only weighs to the gram, not to tenths of grams, and it doesn't have a timer. Here's what I want:\n\nWeighs to .1 grams\nFast response time\nPreferably includes a timer and can display timer and weight at the same time\nWaterproof would be nice but not a priority\n\nStuff like ratios and so forth might be handy, but I can figure that out with my phone easily enough so IMO it's not worth spending more money on. \n\nRight now I just do pourover and Aeropress, not espresso. However, I have been eyeing the Cafelat Robot, so something that would work with that would be a plus. I know that there's not much space for a scale between the legs so a scale small enough to fit there would be nice. But again, mainly I just need it to be accurate to .1 grams, be fast, and preferably have a timer. Anything else would just be a bonus. Thanks for any input!",

        "text": "Hello! I’m pretty new to coffee and I am in search of some advice. Not a huge fan of super strong coffee, and I enjoy it quite milky (think lots of lattes). I know Tassimo seems to be a bad word to coffee lovers (apologies for any offence caused), but I had a machine gifted to me for Christmas. \n\nI am excited to try the coffee as I definitely am not a coffee snob and I enjoy a costa latte now and then. \n\nI am a little conscious of the cost and environmental impact involved with the pods. It’s not likely I’ll have more than one a day, but I was wondering if anyone knows of any reputable reusable pods? Ones that I could fill the day before or something so I have them to hand? \n\nAlso, I know the latte pods require a separate creamer pod. Is there a reusable alternative to this that anyone can recommend? I know I could heat the milk separately, but I was sorta hoping this machine would make the world of coffee easier to navigate for me.\n\nPs - I know lots of people like having cafetière and French press coffees, but this isn’t really for me - sorry in advance.",

        "text": "Hey all, I’m just over a week into my v60 journey- I watched James Hoffmann’s video on different Hario filters and their respective draw down times, and I attempted to buy the “faster” un-tabbed ones on Amazon. They were the 40ct boxed ones that read like they matched the ones from the video, but when I got them they were in the crinkly plastic bag inside the box, had tabs on them, and appear to be the same as the ones that came with my full v60 kit.\n\nAny idea how get the proper “faster” un-tabbed ones? I have no interest in shelling out the money for the Sibarist filters- are there cheaper “faster” alternatives?\n\nGetting pretty great cups so far using the standard Hoffmann method (not the newer 1 cup method), but I’m getting consistently long draw down times- I’ve experimented with coarser grinds and that speeds things up, but I’ve found it to result in a more watery cup, so trying to find a happy medium with a finer grind but faster draw down time. Any help is much appreciated!",
