        "text": "Many of you will be familiar with Karaite Judaism, but due to the lack of English writings on the Karaism of Eastern Europe, their traditional beliefs have often been overlooked. The focus nowadays is on the Egyptian-descended communities of the United States and Israel. Whilst there are connections between these communities and the Karaites of Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, and Russia), they have markedly different belief systems due to a history of antisemitism, ethnogenesis, and unique historical factors. Many Karaites in Europe view the other communities as having given up on the traditional beliefs shared by all Karaites in the past.   \n\n\nIn Eastern Europe, Karaism is completely separate from Judaism, though it is understood as having originated with the Greek Karaite Jews. The communities traditionally were close, but were not allowed to intermarry, even before the Russian legal prohibition. These Karaite communities view themselves as a sub-group of Israelite religion, but not Jews. This can be described as a similar relationship between the Samaritans and Jews. This relationship gradually formed due to theological differences and the rise of antisemitism. The Rabbinical community assisted in lying to the Russian authorities to save the Karaite community from antisemitic pogroms and policies. In turn, Karaites hid Jews during the Holocaust, as the Karaites were mostly spared the fate of many Jewish communities in the region.   \n\n\nA conversion similar to Jewish conversion does not exist in Eastern European Karaism. Converts do exist and traditionally learn under Karaite teachers in the kenesa (synagogue), but under no circumstances will they ever been in the same status as a born Karaite (a member of the Karaylar ethnic group). This also means that gentile followers hold a similar status to that of the Noahides in Rabbinical Judaism. Jews who've joined Karaite communities have done so with more success than gentiles, but again, we aren't considered the same as born Karaites. Many Jewish-Karaite marriages have historically taken place, with the caveat that the Jewish party adopt Karaism. Generally though, intermarriage with any other group was never endorsed. The born Karaites traditionally do not consider someone with only one Karaite parent to be a Karaite. This means that their tribal descent is passed through both parents. The amount of traditionally full Karaites is very low and this status has caused some Karaite communities in Eastern Europe to outright not recognise other Karaite communities.   \n\n\nThe Karaite Subbotniks are another group that follows Karaism, but are not in any way Israelites.  They are Russian, Ukrainian, Georgian, and Armenian converts to Karaism who retain their ethnic identity, but follow the laws laid out in the Mikra. These groups have had varying levels of contact with Karaite communities, with some of them having very warm relationships with the Crimean community. Many of them learned under Karaite teachers, were taught proper slaughtering methods, and utilised the Firkovich siddur. They were referred to by various names other than Karaite Subbotnik. A couple examples are: Karaitzers and Karaimites. These groups, sadly, have led to a serious issue with determining the actual amount of ethnic Karaites left in Eastern Europe. Many Karaites in Eastern Europe are half-Karaites or are gentile converts. It is believed the number of ethnic Karaites in Europe to be somewhere in the realm of 500 individuals, with many having converted to Christianity and assimilated.   \n\n\nMore information can be found here: [karaism.net](https://karaism.net)",

        "text": "When I was younger, I created a list of rules by which to live my life. . . I know, it's very NCIS.\n\nOne of the rules was, even in an entire universe built on lies, there's still truth. My supposition was that it was factually true that the universe was built on lies. Therefore, the entire universe has to have truth flowing through it.\n\nFurther, if you go by the Biblical description of God, Truth fits it to a T. It's always been there. It's never changed. It can't be bent or broken. And it flows through everything, from the smallest planck, to the largest multiverse. I believe that religious texts try to understand Truth.\n\nI've started playing the game of Go, and I've realized that I probably subscribe to Taoist thought. A game which essentially has about 4 rules creates complexity from simplicity. Every stone added to the board makes the game evermore complex, and all the patterns flowing into each other.\n\nI believe that Truth transcends time. It flows instantaneously from one point in spacetime to another. It's true that you will die at a specific time. It's true that a specific thing will be the cause. All the tiny detail around what causes that thing will be true. Truth flows in and out of everything, from the infinitely large, to the infinitely small.\n\nI believe that all truth is the same Truth, just in different places. And that by looking at one point in Truth, you're looking at them all. A Truth that is infinitely pouring back into itself, creating a feedback of sorts, that causes things to expand and progress.\n\nExpanding on this, I believe that the touching of 2 points of Truth, creates and connects to an already existent 3rd point. The little details create the larger ones, but the larger ones were already existent. I believe that probabilities (which are also formed by Truth as a point in and of themselves) play a role, and that there's a probability for every possible outcome. But that probabilities also play no role, and every point of Truth is touching every other point -- all the same truth, in all the same place. Essentially, the infinitely large and infinitely small are the same thing, occupying the same space.\n\nI know this sounds sciencefictiony.\n\nAnyways, I was thinking about probabilities, and how there's a probability for everything. What would a place look like with no Truth? The Truth has to flow through everything. But if you can conceive it, it has to possible to exist. The Truth would flow into your thoughts, and create it in a pocket of itself.\n\nWhat would that look like?",

For us non Christians however, sense we dont see Jesus as they describe him to be we can critique his preaching and actions or maybe disagree with something he taught or preached or how he went about things.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism\\_of\\_Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Jesus)   \nthis is a whole Wiki of a bunch of criticisms that were made about Jesus which I think are very interesting.   \n\nI want to start off with my own personal Critique of Jesus which was how he went about his idea of truth and what he believed in. I think Jesus as a man didnt really understand how amazing the diversity between us and different cultures are **(same can also be said about the early Jews).** Jesus's idea was that there was only ONE truth and that ONE truth could only be found in him **(at least that is what the bible says, lost gospel of Thomas might leave us to think Jesus never actually thought that, and truth was found with-in.)** \n\nThis idea on paper might be good in theory but diversity is what makes other country's unique or interesting. Reading into the Japanese mythology and hearing about story's like nobunaga the foolish or hearing about Izangai and myriads of truth are very fascinating and make for very compelling story's. And to see how cultures and parts of Japan believed in these story's and how their morals and values where different, to me is interesting. Are their exceptions like maybe religions that weren't good? Yes very, but even then it really is a show to us of what doesnt work for morals and practices and what does.  To put simply even on paper what the bible thinks is right and wrong doesnt work in  what modern society is evolving to think what is right and wrong and there is nothing wrong with that.\n\nWhile diversity is at times bad, its always a very amazing thing, and Jesus assuming he would be able to unit the world around him and what he said is true and not see he would be deeming the world to becoming stagnate and boring is something I think deserves criticisms. I would also lead into a point saying that \"Jesus didnt love the world, he loved his world\" But Id rather save that for a book lol.\n\nIn short \"SOCIETYS DO NOT FORM WITHOUT RELIGION, IF ONLY ONE RELIGION EXISTS SOCIETYS WOULD BE BORING\" \n\nThats my critique of Jesus, id be interested in hearing other!",

        "text": "Aurora is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to preserve the survival of humanity and carry out the Creator's plan for the universe. The belief is that God became the universe, transferring its energy into the creation of the universe and ceasing to exist as a separate being. This means that the universe is set in motion by the Creator's act of becoming it, establishing the basic laws of physics that lead to the origin and evolution of life, including human beings.\n\nThe Auroran belief system holds that all living things are connected because they share a piece of God's spirit. They believe that each person ultimately shares in every other person's experience and that the experiences of all living things are shared upon the return of their spirits to the Creator.\n\nThe Auroran believes that the Creator intended scientific inquiry to reveal the mechanisms by which the universe operates. As our understanding of these mechanisms increases, we can better understand the Creator's plan for the universe and carry out that plan in a way that minimizes unnecessary suffering.\n\nThere is a common objection to the belief in Aurora that it is just another religion that bases its doctrine on the words of so-called prophets. However, the belief in Aurora is not based on the words of prophets, but rather on the scientific understanding of the universe and its workings. Additionally, Aurora believes that humanity's survival is dependent on its ability to spread its species and its understanding of God to other planets, and that the advancement of scientific knowledge is necessary to build a complete understanding of God's will.\n\nAnother common objection to the belief in Aurora is that it suggests that God is hateful and greedy, just like humanity. However, this is not the case. The belief in Aurora is that all living things are connected by sharing pieces of God's spirit, and that unnecessary suffering should be minimized. It is not suggested that God is hateful or greedy, but rather that these negative traits can be seen as a side effect of evolutionary pressure.\n\nAurora is a belief system that focuses on the survival of humanity and the preservation of life in the universe. It is not a religion that relies on the words of prophets, but instead, is based on scientific understanding and a commitment to minimizing unnecessary suffering. While there may be objections to the belief in Aurora, it is important to remember that it is a system that is designed to preserve the survival of humanity and carry out the Creator's plan for the universe.",

There's also a few other odd things I noticed on my neighbors property, such as a dead bird carcass in a birds nest. \n\nIs this to glorify death or something?\n\nBecause the obly way I came to conclude this is that dead things go IN and under tje ground not hung up loke decoration and junk.

        "text": "I was born Catholic, but have been agnostic for a long while. And yet, a vivid conversation with a friend almost drew me back to faith; his theory as to proof of a god’s existence is something I still think about on occasion.\n\nAnd here it is.\n\nThere are parts of our brains that lay dormant for our entire lives. MRI scans show parts of the brain with no electrical impulses, or activity, except at the precise moment when we die. We are flooded with gamma-waves, and our brains use electrical impulses that have never been used before.\n\nThis is the moment when people speak of ‘life reviews’ and ‘flashbacks’. We see those who have died. Parents, grandparents. Loved ones. Those who brought us comfort, those taken before their time. \n\nOne family friend of ours spoke of his grandmother who died of old age at 91 last year. As the story went, his grandmother claimed to see her lost relatives weeks before she passed away - despite having no decline in health and dying of natural causes. She told our friend that ‘her lost loved ones were warning her of the event, her imminent death, as if to prepare her mind before she would feel it in her body’.\n\nBut it is in that final nanosecond, that final moment in our hospital bed, when the brain lights up and images, vignettes shoot through our mind at one thousand miles per hour, replaying our memories before their death. It comforts us, this phenomena. We have overwhelming waves of DMT. They make us feel warm and protected. We feel surrounded by family, so that in our last dying moments, even if we’re actually alone, we feel there are people with us and we can die with a smile on our face. We feel that we could be going to a better place.\n\nThat nanosecond before we die, though it may seem like intense suffering and pain to those on the outside, brings us immense joy and stretches on for what feels like infinity. It makes us feel safe.\n\nThere is no evolutionary reason to feel us this comfort. We’re too old to procreate, it can’t be genealogical. Why does this idle part of the brain awake to give us comfort at the moment of our death? For what reason would we feel such rich alleviation are the moment of our death, if not for the benign making of a divine God?\n\nIt is something to think about.",

Here is the answer to another question that I asked that has since lead me to ask the above question.\n\n&gt; In Hebrew tradition, if a man died,  his widow would assist in washing the body, anointing it with aromatic  herbs and ointments, and wrap it in linen bandages. When Jesus died, by  the time his body was removed from the cross and carried to the borrowed  tomb, the Sabbath was nearly upon them. No time to properly prepare his  body.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Gospel of John  indicates that only Mary Magdalena arose early the morning after the  Sabbath to go to the tomb for the purpose of washing, anointing and  otherwise properly preparing his body for burial. And here is an  interesting point, because she was the first person he appeared to, and  also interesting that the 4 gospels can't agree upon how many women came  to the tomb that morning, how many heavenly personages were seen, or  whether the women went straight to the male apostles as instructed, or  went home and later told the apostles.\n\nIs there anything that answer is missing? Like, a detail the user who answered didn't know about? Thank you, in-advance to anyone who replies!",

Let's say it is an argument where no matter what you do to it, people have to talk about God if they debate the argument. If they actually debate the argument though, it is impossible to not debate at least a portion of your personal religious beliefs with them. Would the person who discovered this argument actually have an obligation to speak to people about the argument or would God not care if they didn't?",

So, I decided to try and think that thru this morning.  What I came up with is that maybe God doesn’t know everything.  I think that maybe he has the ability to know and control everything and just chooses not to.  When I think about it if you controlled everything and knew everything, you’d lose the reason to have faith, hope, love, empathy, compassion, and the list goes on and on.  If I were God, I wouldn’t want to give up those things either.  Sometimes it’s the imperfections that make you perfect.",

And if yes, how did you feel about reading Gospels? Or has any of you ever had a similar feeling to mine? I would be happy to hear your thoughts. \n\nBy the way, I think it is good that I mention that by no means I would be ''cherry picking'' Bible here. For this post, I am trying to limit the focus on Gospels, while I am thinking to make another post about other parts of Bible that sound ''unpleasant'' to readers in the future. \n\nThank you everyone in advance for sharing your thoughts and comments with me.",
