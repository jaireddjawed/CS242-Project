        "text": "This article has recently been shared by many of my Catholic friends on facebook: http://catholicsay.com/bleeding-host-in-poland-confirmed-to-be-the-true-body-and-blood-of-christ/\n\nEvery since leaving the Church last year, I was always pretty confident in my new set of beliefs. However, there has always been one little thing that puts my new life of atheism into question. Miracles. And no, not those silly \"face-of-christ-on-bread\" miracles. Not even the supposed miracles that occur in hospitals across the world. Thank God? More like thank the doctors that just saved your family member's life! Anyways, I am talking about the miracles that require some actual scientific testing to confirm their possible supernatural characteristic. Eucharistic miracles like the [Miracle of Lanciano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_Lanciano) and the [one](http://catholicsay.com/bleeding-host-in-poland-confirmed-to-be-the-true-body-and-blood-of-christ/) mentioned in the link above. Stigmata miracles like that of [Therese Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therese_Neumann) and [Padre Pio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pio_of_Pietrelcina). Vision miracles like the [Miracle of the Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_Sun) and the numerous [Marian Apparitions](http://www.theotokos.org.uk/pages/appdisce/nineapps.html). And of course other miracles like the painting of [Our Lady of Guadeloupe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Guadalupe). Every single one of these miracles casts some sort of doubt in my mind that maybe my lack of belief is wrong. Sure, some of these miracles could be explained scientifically and the witnesses could just be crazy, religious zombies, but to make an appeal to those things seems too easy. What do y'all think? What do you say of miracles?",

        "text": "I was just sitting here thinking. A lot of conflicts come down to territory and greed over countries and areas with things that other people want. BUT most of all religion seems to play the biggest part in the world. Christians in the US still show a lot of bigotry still with the LGBT community with a few bills that have been signed even recently. I agree businesses should be able to refuse service to those who they don't want to give their services to. It's for no reason. It's  hateful and a terrible business choice at that.\n\nAs for say Islam, probably deserves the most criticism for many many reasons. They truly are sexist, racist and a backward society. Women basically have no freedom and gays are killed for being gay. They will kill you for daring to leave the religion. The way they even treat their own kind of people who refuses to convert to extremism is just awful. My biggest problem with them is they worship a child molester and well... A slut.\n\nThese are two of the biggest religions we have out there in the world. I don't know how much blame I can put on all Muslims though. When you really think about it. It's literally all they are taught and all they know. They aren't really given much of a choice. If you grow up how they've been taught for all their lives. It's hard to learn completely different ways. STILL, no excuse at all for them to sill behave like this. This shows the importance of differing opinions though. Islam is a great example of it.\n\nThe Christians have gotten into a pretty nice and progressive attitude, but still has a long ways to go. I'm not sure why they want so much control over other peoples bodies. I thought they believed in free will. So people like drug addicts should be taught with a problem not a criminal.\n\nSo, with all these factors in mind I can't help, but think a lot of these issues are what is causing conflict.. What I mean is that religion is causes a lot of conflict on both sides. Until, the religions completely reform we will be at war for a long time.\n\nI hope one day a lot of people realize this is a potential reason behind all this. Obviously, not all violence can be traced to religion. But, religion and greed seem to be the two biggest contributing factors in our worlds problems today and throughout history.\n\nThis also illustrates just how important free speech is. Cultures like these all the ultimate example of why we need debate and free speech. We need to learn things from all sides. If not we turn into uneducated robots. I wish places all had freedom of speech and all places taught all the different points of view. Religion is the best example of why free speech is so vital.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/4fqm43/why_are_there_so_many_leftist_atheists/",
        "text": "Recently this [Pew Research Poll](http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise-social-and-political-views/) came to my attention. Overwhelmingly atheists lean towards the left. Over 50% consider themselves liberals, over 70% consider themselves Democrats, and nearly 90% believe abortion should be legal and gay marriage is acceptable.\n\nHoly macaroli. For not being officially organized we atheists seem to be in lock step with each other. For being free thinkers we all sure do agree with each other on a lot of things. We agree on issues more so than any other denomination it looks like.Then when you look back at history and see people like Marx, Trotsky, Chomsky, and ostensibly Sanders are all atheists and far leftists. On top of the majority of officially atheist states such as the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea are all atheistic, you can see a clear pattern towards leftist thinking. Not just left, but nearly ubiquitously big government and dare I say it here, authoritarian big government.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that western atheists(especially American) are a minority and break away from traditional thinking by being atheists. So it would make sense that thinking towards leftist, moral relativism, and new methods of social organization would be attractive. There's also the elephant in the room on this one. Atheists tend to have a higher IQ and go to college in higher numbers than the religious. To a large extent colleges have a much higher number of leftist professors. To not recognize that is folly.\n\nWith those factors in consideration I can understand where the bias comes from, but most of us share a few things in common to be atheists: we're evidence and reason based. I'm not sure about the rest of you, but when I decided it was OK to not believe in a deity, it was a very liberating feeling. With that said, the leftists and socialists want to take freedom away. The idea of regulating businesses in ridiculous manners, with wage controls in particular. Wage controls in the way of a minimum wage law that will hurt entrepreneurialism and small businesses when we know from the Scandinavian countries wages should be negotiated through unions/the free market and not mandated from the government.  A high minimum wage law which we know from places like Australia and South Africa it can be used to price low skilled labour and minorities out of the job market. Advocating wage controls in the form of equal work for equal pay laws which have been tried in South Africa and created apartheid due to employers creating all male or all female occupations to make sure they were never breaking the law. History has been crystal clear on economic growth and bringing up the lower and middle classes. The fewer restrictions on business, the better the lot of the average man becomes.\n\nI don't think there's a better modern example of this than [China.](https://www.google.com/#q=china+gdp+per+capita) Once they opened their markets there was an ridiculous explosion of GDP growth and the lot of the average man increased exponentially. This is a direct result of going from a planned economy to a market based one. So when I see people on the left advocate for insane antibusiness laws like 'no business can refuse a transgender person from using any restroom' which opens businesses up to lawsuits and the aforementioned wage controls. It makes me really wonder how atheists can be on the left.\n\nI'm not sure how to say it properly, but perhaps atheists have a feeling of vast superiority. A lack of humility if you will. Perhaps there's a feeling that the only reason big governments have failed in the past was because they weren't as smart as we modern atheist types are.\n\nSo why do you think there are so many leftist atheists?",

So I wrote a long winded response &amp; wonder if I left anything out or if some here disagrees.\n\nHere goes:\n\n***\n\n&gt;I'm gonna skip over most of the first part of your comment considering it's nothing but unnecessary sarcasm. But you say I haven't built a foundation for my claims. I have, and I'd be more than happy to substantiate anything I've said.\n\nYou've said that before multiple times. Yet you haven't bothered to throw anything of the sort into the conversation. Now right after this finally there it is! Something we can actually have a discussion about &amp; something you seem to consider a basis for your beliefs! Damn that took long.     \nAlright long read incoming:\n\n&gt;A painting is evidence for a painter, and the Creation is evidence for a Creator. Unless you can give me a description of a creatio ex nihilo that doesn't require a god, then the presence of the universe is one of the strongest pieces of evidence for a Creator.\n\n&amp; A painter is evidence of his parents part of a species which evolved trough the ages.\nIn other words the painter is a product of his surroundings &amp; incredibly complicated sequences of many causes &amp; effects.\n\nAs much as a boiling pot with water is evidence of a heat source. Let's say a flame. we've come to understand that this transfer of heat from the fire is not the product of the soul of the tree that's burning being released like some African tribe may have once believed but the product of innumerable transfers of kinetic and potential particle energy.\n\nWe've come to explain these things.\n\nAtheism my dear friend is not the belief that everything just popped from nothing. A part of it is the rejection of many concepts that cannot be falsified. Now you may ask yourself: why?\n\nFirst the Egyptians believed the gods were present in the forces of nature &amp; supported the pharao with divine power.\n&amp; it supported the powerstructure &amp; explained the weather, the diseases, the pests, the Nile that made the place habitable &amp; gave life, etc.\n\nNow we know where the water in the Nile comes from, we know how the weather &amp; the diseases work &amp; I don't think we'll ever see a religion like that again.\n\nThen the Greeks believed the gods created the universe from their creators whom they killed &amp; whom themselves came from the primordial deities which came from the primordial chaos.\n&amp; again they explained what the Greeks didn't understand.\n\nNow we know how lightning works &amp; that it's not Zeus being angry, we know how the waves work &amp; that it's not poseidon toying with the sailors &amp; again we're past that.\n\nTrough observation &amp; logical thinking we've stepped away from those kind of things &amp; can explain the world around us.      \n&amp; though the major religions still exist even though they persecuted scientist time &amp; again most have come to give in that hey earth isn't the center of the solar system or the universe, that species can evolve, medical sciences are not witchcraft, etc, etc.\n\n&amp; yet there's still that one question. That one question that asks how it all started.\nWas it a big bang from a singularity or not, did it continue to exist, were Lifshitz and Khalatnikov actually correct &amp; does the universe keep bouncing in &amp; outwards for near eternity, etc etc.\n\nEinstein's  relativity theory first gave quite a few answers. But science had reason to not take it as a concept that cannot be falsified like nearly always with these these kind of things &amp; was correct (even though many people like to think his genius ended at e=mc². \nBecause although it explained a lot it had some holes &amp; thus he kept thinking &amp; came up with the improved one [the general relativity theory](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/3/f/b3f14edb49fd763ec19df7dcf1ff087e.png).\n\nNow the general relativity theory if you understand it led many to believe that there would be a singularity &amp; we've come to try &amp; explain this/those  with for example Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems &amp; from that science went onward &amp; yes things like background microwaves did support this. Now these ones but still didn't explain how it had begun.\n\nSo since then we have come to understand that for the very strong gravitational fields in the early universe general relativity theory would not suffice. The theory would once again have to be completed. Which already knew because it conflicts with quantum theory (After all a singularity where the universe is at Planck size would follow it). So we need to be able to combine these things.\n\nAgain we've come to understand these concepts as falsifiable.\n\nNow the best way to do this according to Hawking is Feymans is sum-over-paths approach &amp; I kind of agree.\nBut that would still not solve our question. How did the universe start so to speak.\n\nNow Hawking together with Hartle had their idea on how this worked (and again still taking it as falsifiable) &amp; Hawking  had a nice analogy for this which is kinda related to what you posted earlier about having disproven the flat-earthers. Which went something like this:\n\n&gt;The problem of what happens at the edge of the world was solved when people realized that the world was not a flat plate, but a curved surface\nTime however, seemed to be different. It appeared to be separate from space, and to be like a model railway track. If it had a beginning, there would have to be someone to set the trains going. Einstein's General Theory of Relativity unified time and space as spacetime, but time was still different from space and was like a corridor, which either had a beginning and end, or went on forever. However, when one combines General Relativity with Quantum Theory, Jim Hartle and I realized that time can behave like another direction in space under extreme conditions. This means one can get rid of the problem of time having a beginning, in a similar way in which we got rid of the edge of the world. Suppose the beginning of the universe was like the South Pole of the earth, with degrees of latitude playing the role of time. The universe would start as a point at the South Pole. As one moves north, the circles of constant latitude, representing the size of the universe, would expand. To ask what happened before the beginning of the universe would become a meaningless question, because there is nothing south of the South Pole. The picture Jim Hartle and I developed of the spontaneous quantum creation of the universe would be a bit like the formation of bubbles of steam in boiling water. \n\n&gt;The idea is that the most probable histories of the universe would be like the surfaces of the bubbles. Many small bubbles would appear, and then disappear again. These would correspond to mini universes that would expand but would collapse again while still of microscopic size. They are possible alternative universes but they are not of much interest since they do not last long enough to develop galaxies and stars, let alone intelligent life. A few of the little bubbles, however, grow to a certain size at which they are safe from re-collapse. They will continue to expand at an ever increasing rate, and will form the bubbles we see. They will correspond to universes that would start off expanding at an ever increasing rate.\n\n&gt;Time, as measured in degrees of latitude, would have a beginning at the South Pole, but the South Pole is much like any other point, at least so I have been told. I have been to Antarctica, but not to the South Pole. The same laws of Nature hold at the South Pole as in other places. This would remove the age-old objection to the universe having a beginning; that it would be a place where the normal laws broke down. The beginning of the universe would be governed by the laws of science.\n\nTo cut it short he then goes on to explain that our early universe would not be completely uniform &amp; how these differences in density would cause for example the earliest stars to form, those irregularity's that his theorem predicted were shown on the basis of the earlier mentioned microwaves by the Map satellite leading him to believe we're on the right track.\n\nThe marriage of general relativity &amp; quantum theory leads us to believe that our universe wil expand at an initially ever increasing rate only to then gradually slow down\n&amp; still we're not certain here because some observations say it's actually accelerating again.\n\nWe're not at a watertight solution yet till we do not take any unfalsifiable arguments.\n\nGuess what happened tho belief &amp; religion knocked on the door again to explain something for which there is/was yet an answer.\n\nAccording to Hawkins in 1981 at the Vatican conference on cosmology Pope John Paul II said that \n\n&gt;it was all right to study the evolution of the universe after the Big Bang, but we should not inquire into the Big Bang itself because that was the moment of Creation and therefore the work of God.” \n\nApparently some have said Hawkins misrepresented the Pope's statement and that he said something different  so for completeness sake they claim he said:\n\n&gt;Every scientific hypothesis about the origin of the world, such as the one that says that there is a basic atom from which the whole of the physical universe is derived, leaves unanswered the problem concerning the beginning of the universe. By itself science cannot resolve such a question: it requires human knowledge which rises above the physical, the astrophysical, what we call the metaphysical; what is required above all is the knowledge which comes from the revelation of God.\n\n&amp; later from a site of the Vatican itself:\n\n&gt;The more we know about physical reality, about the history and structure of the universe, about the fundamental make-up of matter and the processes and patterns which at the roots of the material world, the more we can appreciate the immensity of the mystery of God, the more we are in a position to grasp the mystery of ourselves - our origin and our destiny. For creation, as we have come to know it, speaks to us in fragmentary yet very true reflections of the God who created it and maintains it in existence. **Of course, that picture must always remain tantalizingly incomplete**. For certain aspects of our lives rise above and move beyond the material dimension and, while having deep roots in the material, surpass the understanding which the natural sciences are capable of providing.\n\nAll in all it boils down to the same thing.     \nThe pope never read Hawkin's submitted paper discussed earlier in his analogy when he brought those statements.\nSo as I said yet again the faith based position knocks on the door, pops up &amp; despite being proven wrong on innumerable fronts before, says: \n\"The universe came from nothing or always existed is not a clear enough answer for you? You are working on theorems to solve this. \nWell we have our solution. God the omnipotent being that came from nothing or always existed made it.\"\n\nA statement akin to yours that you &amp; he claim is not falsifiable. (&amp; to which you add things such as \"Oh &amp; he took a rest after so you &amp; everyone else should too.\") A statement that brings it's own questions just like the initial general relativity theary did which you present as proof something which it in no shape or form even resembles.\n\nWhy oh why do you, the pope, whoever the fuck....wants us to just accept it? Without any proof. To not look further. Why?\n\nOh &amp; to answer your last paragraph.\n\n&gt;I don't know why you're telling me to learn what the Genetic Fallacy is. Do you need me to explain it to you?\n\nBecause it wasn't a Genetic Fallacy. I never said it is proof that your belief is wrong because you would not have it if you were born somewhere completely different.\nI said it because it's something that should make you think not only about the certainty of the base &amp; rules of your belief but more importantly about imposing them on others who do not follow your belief. Ie someone not willing to follow your laws based on those views he does not share is not \"delusional\".",

You can't criticize my claims because you can't use logic because logic is God. \n\nAs many street preachers of his ilk do, he was yelling very rapidly and really looking for any way to find disagreement with the Christians in the group as well as myself. \n\nI asked him how, even if I granted that God was Knowledge, we could get from a vague, faceless deism to the Christian God and he bunny-hopped away from that subject after calling me \"The Devil\". \n\nI know that generally it is best to simply not engage presuppositionalists, but I had already challenged one of his points before I realized how much of a presuppositionalist he was.

        "text": "In the book \"Virtue and Value in a Godless Universe\", Erik Wielenberg quotes Ralph Cudworth (1976):\n\n\"[D]iverse modern theologers do not only seriously, but zealously con- tend...that there is nothing absolutely, intrinsically, and naturally good and evil, just and unjust, antecedently to any positive com- mand or prohibition of God; but that the arbitrary will and pleasure of God . . . by its commands and prohibitions, is the first and only rule and measure thereof. Whence it follows unavoidably, that nothing can be imagined so grossly wicked, or so foully unjust or dishonest, but if it were supposed to be commanded by this omnipotent Deity, must needs upon that hypothesis forthwith become holy, just, and righteous.\"\n\nA popular strategy for responding to this kind of objection is to maintain that because it is part of God’s essential nature to have a certain type of character (say, to be loving), there are some things such that making them good or right is incompatible with God’s essential nature.\n\nFor example, Edward Wierenga (1983) suggests that because God is all-loving, “He would not command an action which, were it to be performed, would be a gratuitous pummeling of another human being.” In this way, it is denied that God could make just any logically consistent ethical claim true. There are some logically consistent ethical claims – for instance that it would be obligatory for someone to inflict a gratuitous pummeling on another human being – that God cannot make true because doing so is inconsistent with His essential nature. Nevertheless, all true ethical claims are true in virtue of some act of will on the part of God. It is still divine willing that determines which ethical claims are true, but the scope of divine willing is limited by the divine character. \n\nWielenberg critiques the response by asserting that \"there are some ethical truths that no being is capable of making true and there are some ethical claims that no being is powerful enough to make true.\"\n\nI have not understood Wielenberg's critique. Idk if you guys have read this book but he mentioned a brief story relating to this critique that I haven't really understood. Any other arguments against this theistic response that God theortically could make torture good but he doesn't be it is incompatible with it's nature, thereby maintain both the goodness and his ability to make anything good or bad (creator of ethics).",

        "text": "I have recently had a few conversations with theists who have claimed that there is no justification in using atheism in that way, despite it appearing in many dictionary definitions. \nOne felt that there is a deliberate plan by 'internet atheists' to change the definition of atheism, to include the agnostic people, and thus to artificially inflate the number of atheists. \n\nI find that the earliest uses of the word in English (16th century) do seem to imply denial of gods. The oldest sources in the OED do, though the very early origins of the word in Greek seem to start with lack of belief but pick up an implication of denial later. However I am interested in the English usage.  \n\nAnyway, what are the earliest written examples in English of the lack-of-belief definition?\n\nI found George H Smith's [*The Case Against God*](http://www.amazon.com/Atheism-Case-Against-Skeptics-Bookshelf/dp/087975124X/ref=la_B000APQXRY_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1460748534&amp;sr=1-1) published in 1979 takes that stance, according to [this irritated reviewer.](http://tektonics.org/qt/smithg01.php)\n\nAny earlier? TH Huxley in 1889 seemed so sure of the denial definition only, that he coined the word ['agnostic'](http://atheism.about.com/od/aboutagnosticism/a/huxley.htm) as an alternative. He was a highly educated man, and I think if the lack-of-belief definition was current then, he would have mentioned it.\n\nLets see if we can have this thread without anyone posting about how atheism is about belief and agnosticism about knowledge...\n\nSo, any advance on 1979?\n\nEdit: lots of comments about the value of the matter, not so many early examples of the usage. I have Bertie Russell and Robert Green Ingersoll to check. Any more? \n\n\n\n",

I keep thinking back to a statement by NDT about how he knows high level scientists who are also deeply religious, but that was sets them apart is their ability to let the data speak for itself when it comes to the science.

        "text": "I found this article in this month's *Church Times* ([the world's leading Anglican newspaper](https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/)). Some of these are points that I have seen fellow Atheists raise, so I thought people here may be interested in seeing a detailed Christian response. This man's words were published in a widely-read Christian paper, and I think we should be prepared to answer any and all of his points in a rational and informed manner. If you have rebuttals to any of the points below, I would love to read them.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/GfrbV\n\n**1. \"We are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us go one god further.”**\n\nWith this comment, Dawkins supplies proof positive that the god in whom he and his allies disbelieve is simply a blown-up creature. One of the most astonishing claims in his book *The God Delusion* is that a creator of the world would need to be complex, that this complexity would need to arise from natural selection, and that there is no evidence for the evolution of any being more exalted than humanity so far. The god pictured here is thus a product of the universe, as well as its creator — perhaps a kind of demiurge. To describe the notion as confused is an understatement.\n\nBut look a bit further: Dawkins has little sense of history. It does not occur to him to ask why Christians have rejected pagan gods so resoundingly. Pre-Christian religion regularly mandated self-mutilation and human sacrifice. The weak were despised. Christianity's emphasis on the radical equality of all, and the founding of hospitals, schools, and other philanthropic institutions, were genuinely revolutionary.\n\nLegislation enacted under Roman emperors such as Theodosius II and Constantine raised the status of women. Even slavery — an institution common to all pre-modern societies that attained a certain level of wealth — was described as blasphemous as early as the fourth century by Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa. Although the blasphemy persisted for a further 1500 years, it was finally curtailed on the initiative of Western Christians.\n\n**2. \"The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sado-masochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.”**\n\nThat the Old Testament represents God as acting cruelly or capriciously on occasion need be a real worry only to fundamentalists, for the simple reason that scriptural inerrancy is not itself a scriptural doctrine. Anyone who has done even a short course in biblical study ought to have digested the main-stream Christian view: that scripture is an extraordinary, complex human phenomenon, a library of books of every sort of genre, evolved over millennia, and held together first in the Hebrew scriptures by one nation's quest for identity, and then in the New Testament by the life of an astonishingly original individual.\n\nThe aim of God's creation is that creation should help to make itself; the Bible is humanly written and developed history, riddled with ambiguities and dead ends and fresh starts. Nevertheless, it forms a powerfully challenging call to humanity to grow and reform and criticise itself. What's more, from a Christian point of view, the self-revelation of God comes into full focus only in the life and resurrection of Jesus, and in the descent of the Spirit at Pentecost.\n\n**3. \"There is something infantile in the presumption that somebody else has a responsibility to give your life meaning and point... The truly adult view, by contrast, is that our life is as meaningful, as full, and as wonderful as we choose to make it.”**\n\nThis is an exceptionally common view among post-Enlightenment observers.\n\nIdeal, modern men and women pictured by secularism are free, independent, powerful, rational, brave — the heroes and heroines of many novels and books on philosophy. But they are also proud, and somewhat stunted spiritually.\n\nIs it really true that the modern citizen who has \"come of age\" is the sole arbiter of meaning and value, for example? The religious understanding is that we are tenants in a house not of our own making; that our bodies are our “lendings\" (in the expression used by King Lear in a moment of hard-won wisdom); and that, therefore, we are answerable to a truth we do not create. This strikes many as more realistic, as well as far humbler.\n\n**4. \"More generally, one of the truly bad effects of religion is that it teaches us that it is a virtue to be satisfied with not understanding.”**\n\nThis is a colossal caricature. A well-trodden path towards faith might entail three elements: first, an awareness of ourselves as embodied beings, with the capacity to grasp meaning and truth; second, the process of seeing our status as a gift, prompting awe, gratitude, and a heightened sense of ethical awareness; and, third, an acknowledgement of that gift as grounded in a reality that freely bestows itself to us.\n\nA pillar of orthodoxy such as St Thomas Aquinas thought that a balance needed to be struck between the twin vices of too much religion and too little. Aggressive secularism displays the second of these vices, while fundamentalism — what Aquinas would have called superstition — belongs in the first.\n\nThe Church is not incapable of error: its representatives can easily make statements going far beyond the basic natural perception of the mystery of existence. Such statements can lead to mistakes, conflict, and other evils, including the idolisation of community identities.\n\nIn certain respects, the history of religion maps on to the entire social history of humanity. One implication of this is that religious leaders function better as sources of influence at some distance from political leaders, not as wielders of direct power themselves.\n\nCorrespondingly, while faith groups should be allowed to express their views on the issues of the day, they should not undermine the democratic process.\n\nBut the core point is this: reason infers the existence of causes from the existence of effects, without always being able to infer the nature of causes from the nature of effects. If that applies in more mundane contexts, it is all the more true in a unique area of discussion such as creation.\n\nNote, too, the unacknowledged dogmatism of the view that implies that the only truth is the kind that you can measure in a test tube. The late Herbert McCabe once quipped: \"Richard Dawkins is sure of what God is; and equally sure that God does not exist. I, for my part, am clear that the entity named by Christian tradition as God does indeed exist; but what God is in himself is a subject on which I can say nothing whatever.”\n\n**5. \"A child is not a Christian child, not a Muslim child, but a child of Christian parents or a child of Muslim parents. This latter nomen-clature, by the way, would be an excellent piece of consciousness-raising for the children themselves. A child who is told that she is a 'child of Muslim parents' will immediately realise that religion is something for her to choose — or reject — when she becomes old enough to do so.”**\n\nDawkins resorts to a false antithesis here. It is not just scientists such as himself, but also many philosophers (Richard Rorty being a notable example), who fail to see that secular humanism is not a neutral standpoint, the consequence of subtracting superstition from knowledge. It is an alternative metaphysical vision revolving around what a more searching thinker, Charles Taylor, has called \"images of power, or untrammelled agency, of spiritual self-possession”.\n\nNone of us raises our children in a vacuum. We are all heirs to particular ways of looking at the world. But that is a different matter from the question whether young people should be allowed to make an informed choice about their beliefs. Of course they should.\n\nChristians who doubt this, and atheists who accuse Christianity of inherent intellectual authoritarianism, need reminding that loving your neighbour entails respect for his or her opinions.\n\nWhen Christians and (especially) Muslims have problems over freedom of belief, this is partly a reflection of religion's status as a badge of social identity. In a complex world, where identity is also marked by language, ethnicity, and history, it is not always possible to isolate faith from a context.\n\nAt bottom, though, when Christianity and Islam are true to their guiding principles, both faiths insist on the sanctity of the person, and from this should duly follow recognition of freedom of belief as the first of human rights.\n\n**6. \"Let children learn about different faiths, let them notice their incompatibility, and let them draw their own conclusions about the consequences of that incompatibility. As for whether they are 'valid', let them make up their own minds when they are old enough to do so.”**\n\nBy all means. And if you are a militant atheist, be prepared to take your own medicine if your son or daughter starts to engage with religion in more than a skin-deep manner.\n\n**7. \"I am thrilled to be alive at a time when humanity is pushing against the limits of understanding. Even better, we may eventually discover that there are no limits.”**\n\nThis comment displays a typically wooden understanding of knowing and truth. Science is an exceptionally important mark of human civilisation, but its remit is not all-encompassing. On the contrary, scientism is a sitting duck; for a proposition such as \"the only meaningful statements are those deriving from natural science\" is not itself a proposition of natural science.\n\nIn other words, whether the claim is true or false, it follows that there is at least one fact that is not a physical fact. This was the basic lesson apparently learnt after the bubble of logical positivism burst before the Second World War.\n\nReligious language points to truths that elude scientific treatment, but this should not render it invalid by definition. Take a ready example: our understanding of others, not as objects to be analysed but as persons to be encountered, is just as real as our knowledge of stars or genes — more so, in fact, because it is more direct, and involves a greater spread of our capacities.\n\nAristotle had already made this kind of insight clear well before the birth of Christianity in his *Nicomachean Ethics*. Educated people do not expect the word \"certain\" to mean the same thing in every context, he argues, adding that it is the mark of a juvenile to think that certainty is fully contained in the notion of mathematical certainty.\n\nMathematics poses no difficulty for a \"juvenile\" in this sense. But ethics is difficult, even for a mature person, because certainty is not so easy to come by. You have to grow into it. \n\n**8. \"The only watchmaker is the blind forces of physics.”**\n\nAnother false antithesis. Since Dawkins relies so much on fundamentalist — and deist — caricatures for plausibility, he does not grasp the force of a comment made 800 years ago by Aquinas: that God has made timber that makes itself into a ship rather than made the ship directly. Aquinas was naturally unaware of the theory of evolution, but his words point to why Darwin's theories pose no great challenge to the integrity of Christianity.\n\nAs a consequence of the belief that God's creation makes itself at every level, we can fit into one picture both evolution and its costliness on the one hand, and, on the other, the Christian redemptive answer to human and natural evil.\n\nDawkins thinks that science can answer the ultimate question why there is something rather than nothing. He quotes support from the physicist Lawrence Krauss, author of *A Universe from Nothing*. But Krauss's whole argument assumes the previous existence of a quantum vacuum. Jewish, Muslim, and Christian philosophers have long grasped a core point — that actuality precedes potentiality. In other words, if *x* is potentially *y*, that is only because *x* already exists. \n\nThe point has tended to be imperfectly grasped across the atheist camp. In his book *On Being: A scientist's exploration of the great questions of existence*, the physical chemist Peter Atkins, one of Dawkins's allies, proves no more convincing than Krauss in accounting for existence.\n\nWhat Atkins calls a problem of the profoundest difficulty — namely, the unfolding of absolutely nothing into something — is avoided by arguing that, because the electrical charges and the angular momentums and the energies in the cosmos all add up to zero, absolutely nothing has only unfolded into nothing. Since nothing \"positive\" has to be \"manufactured\", Atkins thinks that there need be no \"positive, specific, munificent creation”.\n\nThis is as if we argued that quarrying a huge pile of material did not amount to anything, because the pile's height was exactly cancelled out by the quarry's depth. Wiser heads have been firm on this point, arguing that it is impossible, in the terms naturalism allows, to say how anything can exist at all. \n\n**9. \"Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, distinctly heard the voice of Jesus telling him to kill women, and he was locked up for life. George W. Bush says that God told him to invade Iraq (a pity God didn't vouchsafe him a revelation that there were no weapons of mass destruction).”**\n\nAn astonishingly weak argument. Would people stop hallucinating if religion were banned? Has Dawkins never heard about the discernment of spirits, among other Christian terms? Or that almost every mainstream church leader on earth opposed the invasion of Iraq?\n\nOf course religious practice can go drastically wrong on occasion. But is sex a bad thing because some people become rapists or paedophiles? Or patriotism wrong because some people become xenophobic nationalists? \n\n**10. \"Isaac Asimov's remark about the infantilism of pseudoscience is just as applicable to religion: `Inspect every piece of pseudo-science and you will find a security blanket, a thumb to suck, a skirt to hold.' It is astonishing, moreover, how many people are unable to understand that 'X is comforting' does not imply 'X is true.’\"**\n\nIt ought to go without saying that the self-aware believer finds faith as Imuch of a challenge as a comfort. Terry Eagleton puts the matter with gusto when he comments that, for Christian teaching, God's love and forgiveness break into our protective self-rationalising little sphere, \"smashing our sentimental illusions and turning our world brutally upside down”.\n\nPie in the sky? Opium of the people? I don't think so. For Jesus, to live was to love. And that, at root, is why he was killed.",

Had a lot of cool stuff to say about my efforts and helped me edge out a chance to be on the YouTube front page for a day.  \n\nI've tried to make even-keeled science content ever since.  /r/atheism is no longer as courteous as it once was, so now I lurk here.  Anyways, fast forward several years.  My YouTube channel has grown, and I've kind of started making it a theme to demonstrate the ability to have an intelligent, respectful conversation with someone you don't always agree 100% with.  \n\nI found a guy. His name is Matt, and I saw that he was doing YouTube videos about Christianity in a different way.  I noticed that many of his videos appealed to Atheists more than traditional Christians because of the way he talks openly and doesn't engage in cultural Christianity the way most do.  He doesn't have many viewers yet, but I really want more people to be as real and casual as he is about these things.  Anyways, he recently changed the name of his channel and although I don't post here much, I really wanted to share it here because I remember that so many years ago it was the kind Atheists of good will that helped me jump start my efforts to popularize exploring science and getting along with everyone regardless of their beliefs.  If you were part of that original crowd (many people like me subsequently made the transition over here) I just wanted to say \"Thanks\", and that I think you'll like what this guy is doing.  [Here's his video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_YETaTJvk4)  I think it's clever and fun and he seems to not take himself too seriously.  All the things that remind me of my state of mind when I made that \"reach across the aisle\" post years ago.\n\nRegards,\n\nDestin",

I went through a phase of asking myself \"what if he'll is real\" and \"what's gonna happen to me when I die\". It started to get out of hand at some points and eventually I came across some people on YouTube who you could call \"spiritual but not religious\" they were against the church system which they said was \"off Satan\" and any Christian who goes there is serving demons and being deceived. They all claimed to hear the voice of God as in a actual voice that would speak to them and that in order to be saved you had to disconnect from friends and if necessary family. They all stated that video games and TV are sinful and that you need to live holy in order to be saved. One even made a prophecy about a flood in south Africa that a few weeks later actually happened. I didn't know who to turn to considering how much they were stating I felt like I was denial. I always thought to myself \"so many people claim NDE and hearing gods voice so how can it not be real\". All this information shocked me and it's still bothering me. I don't believe them but it's still eating away at me like \"what if I'm wrong\". Do you guys have any advice or evidence to counter their claims?",

I only hope I will die in company of someone and loved and not alone. \n\nNow, I have clear moral standards, and a lot of motivation in my life (to help people/do something useful, and just some basic simple things for my heart), and all the other extremely healthy and productive things maximally far away from any sort of depression or nihilism. \n\nBut this just fucking gets me. The more I think about it the more I become obsessed with the thought. I thought maybe this is something wrong with my psychology - no, it's with the actual content of the problem that is problematic. If in the end - according to science, at most *most* 100 trillion years from now there will be no more stars shining, and once the remaining shallow resources are used up, we'll have to die off - there won't be anyone and anything going on anymore, ever - if this moment will really *really* come just like tomorrow - that's just fucking [way too bad](http://i.imgur.com/Knh0L.gif). \n\nI want to emphasize the fundamental difference between my own future death and that. I don't think of myself as such a special snowflake (nor worse than others, of course). I will die; say in 100 years there won't be me, but someone else will be enjoying life instead, different than me but no worse than me.

The one I go to holds a service mostly composed of \"worshipping\", which is us singing along to Christian songs.

I'm smiling ear to ear but I hide it by pretending to be into the music.\n\nThen the sermon begins, and guess who is giving the sermon...

        "text": "Hi there - I've lurked here for a while and prefer the tone to r/atheism.\n\nI know I'll still be in a minority but I feel like at least I'll get respectful and insightful debate here. To put my cards on the table: I'm one of those rare breeds of atheist who regards religion as a very positive thing, to the point I try to lead my life along some sort of religious grounds, just without a literal theism. (It's complicated and I'd rather not go into my personal position too much, but think it's better to set it out at the outset: essentially, though, I am not a theist in any meaningful sense).\n\nAnyway, I know from previous discussions that John Gray gets short shrift around here (albeit respectfully), but wondered if any of you had seen this fairly recent article. I was especially intrigued by this paragraph:\n\n\"There is no way in which a model of the mind inherited from Descartes and other rationalist philosophers can be squared with the findings of evolutionary biology. If you follow Darwin in thinking of human beings as animals that have evolved under the pressures of natural selection, you cannot think that our minds are primed to seek out truth. Rather, our ruling imperative will be survival, and any belief that promotes this will have a powerful attraction. This may be why we are so anxious to discern a pattern in the drift of events. If there is none, our future will depend largely on chance – a dispiriting prospect. The belief that our lives unfold under some kind of supernatural direction offers a way out, and if this faith enables us to live through disaster, that it may be groundless is irrelevant. From an evolutionary perspective, irrational belief isn’t an incidental flaw in human beings. It has made us what we are. In that case, why demonise religion?\"\n\nThe full article is here:\n\nhttp://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2016/01/why-humans-find-it-hard-do-away-religion\n\nAs usual there's a massive range to what he's saying, and there are the usual sweeping statements which often seem designed to provoke (and normally do - by the way I have mixed feelings about Gray). But if I have a specific question for you guys, it's about the relationship between religion and evolution.\n\nIt does seem to me that Gray is at his strongest when it comes to Darwin. I always feel he swallows and accepts the true implications of Darwin, no matter how unpalatable to the majority of human beings (no matter what their theology) better than a lot of other atheist critics, and I do find the thought that supernatural belief is so profoundly wound up with the physical and social evolution of homo sapiens somewhat intriguing.\n\nAre we so sure that it's even possible to completely eradicate it (whatever that would mean in practice)? What about Gray's suggestion that Marxism and now science-driven neo-liberalism are really just quasi-religious myths popping up in new guises?\n\nWhat if science and psychology comprehensively demonstrate, for instance, that it's better for human mental health to have some sort of religious faith? (And by the way, the great majority of studies seem to show that it is: http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Simon%20Dein%20Religion%20and%20Mental%20Health.%20Current%20Findings.y.pdf - in many ways that's hardly surprising given how long it seems to have been hard-wired into the human animal).\n\nI know Gray is a divisive figure, and I certainly don't agree with everything he says. But as I've seen others post around here, you can't hide from uncomfortable truths no matter what your position, and he's good at those; so please throw a bunch of uncomfortable truths back at me to challenge mine!",

Forgive the long, well worn Creationist video links. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.\n\nHis initial point seems to be about an internal Christian Theologian issue that doesn't interest me much. Whether or not the validity of the Christian faith hinges on the literal truth of their creation myth and the rifts with Christianity about this issue are just more evidence of the falsity of the Christian faith. It is what you would expect to find in an incorrect world view.\n\nThe second part is ostensibly about this guy http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jason_Lisle. Feel free to wade through hours of Creationist apologetics at your leisure. I'm not familiar with Jason Lisle but a lot of what he seems to be about reminds me of Ken Ham and his ilk. Any info or good resources for rebuttals about his work would be appreciated.\n\nThe third point essentially states that \"You cannot use scientific method to test something that only happened once, and never again.\" One example I was going to mention in my reply was the study of the Big Bang, other examples of science studying something that has only ever occurred once would be helpful.\nThe fourth point seems to hinge on legal witness testimony. Essentially the bible is is supposed to be a legal document bearing witness to the life and resurrection of Christ. I was going to refer to the long tradition of Biblical scholarship, pseudepigrapha and cases of unreliable witnesses in legal cases. Anything else you can think of would be great.\n\n\nAnd finally, this ridiculous video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0u3-2CGOMQ \nWhich posits that we can't know anything unless we literally view it. That, for some reason studying evidence isn't valid. That evolution is discredited by being similar to religion ie. requiring faith. There is no evidence for macro evolution etc etc\nIt seems he has fallen into Ken Hams and Ray Comforts cabal so nothing new in that regard. Anyway, I thank you for any advice or feedback you can give and if you are interested I can post his responses.\nThanks\n\n*edit: It would seem Roger has entered the building. Welcome /u/geesleeper !

They all claim that Christians in the church system are not saved and that only gods chosen elect can understand the Bible and that atheists are never going to understand it. I find it weird that they claim God speaks to them and they all teach the same thing but they don't know eachother personally. I'm not an expert so I wanna get your opinions on this sort mindset because it's just weird to me these sort of people are out there and say these sorts things. One of them even goes as far to say that logic is useless when trying to understand God and that only his chosen people can understand him while unbelievers can't and never will.",

I'd just really like to know if there's anywhere on Reddit where there can be a truly substantive discussion on this issue, or if it's just hopeless here. My pessimism about this is at an all time high. \n\n- I know that, in the past, I've expressed some controversial (and even misguided/erroneous) opinions on some issues I talk about in my post; and I suppose I can understand if these slightly colored the response on /r/Christianity. But I'd also hope that my current post could be appreciated on its own terms... and the fact that I've tried to avoid errors of the past; and am absolutely open to conceding errors in the current post, too.\n\nIn any case: contrary to how it was characterized by several (and presuming this is why it was removed for \"bigotry\"), the post was not about Catholics being monolithically \"dumb\" or stubborn, or *anything* like that. From the very beginning of the post, I spoke of the brilliance of academic theologians (which certainly includes Catholic theologians); and in the end I reiterated the intellectual good-will of thinkers on the issues I raised -- somewhat in *contrast to* some comments by Richard Blackwell, a prominent historian of Galileo. \n\nIndeed, above all, my post was about the precarious position that Catholic theologians find themselves in on a few different issues, based on some considerations about common principles of Catholic theology/dogma. The relevant sort of meta-theological principle here is the **harmony of Catholic dogma, on one hand, and (ostensibly secular) historical, scientific, and philosophical research on the other**; but the elements of the former that are problematic for a total harmony include 1) the Catholic position on Biblical inerrancy; 2) the necessity of a historical Adam/Eve; 3) the particular theory of substance upon which the doctrine of [transubstantiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transubstantiation) is premised, and its metaphysical problems; etc. \n\nIt was discussion of the first two of these that made up the bulk of my post. Now, I think another problem here is that there are certain rampant misconceptions about the Catholic positions on these issues. Both Biblical inerrancy and a historical/literal Adam are positions commonly associated with fundamentalist Protestantism. Yet Catholicism's commitment to these is not truly in dispute (as is the academic/theological consensus, and as I amply demonstrated throughout my post and in its external links).\n\nNow, another possible area of confusion here is that Biblical inerrancy, of the kind Catholicism holds, does not mean Biblical *literalism*. Yet this also doesn't mean that Catholicism isn't ever committed to *some* literal interpretations. In this regard, one thing I've suggested is that if Catholicism truly has conceded that secular historical/scientific research can work autonomously -- and that it will do its best to *harmonize with* its research and results -- this also applies to, among other things, academic Biblical exegesis; and consequently if, say, Biblical exegetes were to develop a consensus that the Biblical texts unambiguously place the historical Adam in the historical context of the [Neolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic) era, then Catholicism would have good reason to concede this point.\n\nNow, there are slight complications here. One problem, however, is that the undisputed interpretation of Catholic dogma on this point is that the historical Adam is in fact the genetic ancestor of all humans (who have lived and currently live); and of course it's impossible to harmonize this with Adam having lived as late as the Neolithic.\n\nI don't want this summary to become as long as the original post itself, so I'll leave it at that. But yeah, the general principle here is that there's strong tension between the Catholic doctrine of harmonization with critical research vs. how this can *actually* play out \"on the ground,\" when critical research itself *isn't* bound by any doctrinal/dogmatic restraints, and consequently can freely hypothesize about certain historical/scientific/philosophical positions that are impermissible in Catholic dogma (and indeed that universally-held *consensuses* can develop about these, in contrast to the Catholic positions).

You have dreams, you can hear things around you ect.\nScientifically they're right.\nThat being said, what am I? I don't view me as my subconscious. I don't view me as the sum of my parts.

        "text": "Hi,\n\nIt has been quite a few years that I identify as an agnostic, even though I can say that as far as religion is concerned it is all man-made systems with various degrees of intelligence or evil. Up until I was +-21 y-o I still had some love for the idea of a loving God, even though that had been in constant decline ever since my late teens. As I grew up though that belief, or perhaps I should call it a will to believe, has been obliterated (I'm now 28). Anyway, that in itself was/is not a big deal in my book. I don't live in a religious society and my relatives are very liberal believers who react 100% cool to the fact that I don't identify as such. Heck, my girlfriend is a Muslim girl (my family isn't) and she couldn't give two shits either (and before you ask, no, it does not disturb me a bit that she is religious, I'm not that kind of fundamentalist anti-theist). And despite all of that... I am now facing one of the biggest, if not the biggest, existential crisis of my life. And here is why:\n\n\nWhen I was younger I was a very optimistic, happy go lucky fellow. Always tried to see the good in people. Always sought for \"solutions instead of problems\" to whatever situation that could be thrown on me, be it a family crisis or world hunger. And whenever things got tougher I simply put the tab on my faith. It should be said that that was not  \"instituional faith\", i.e. I was never a church goer and the few ocasions I took part in communal stuff were pretty rare and probably to please the people I was with. My faith was just a personal belief that a God existed and that he was essentially Goodness. So whatever overwhelming doubt, conflict, fear etc I ocasionally had I'd tell my self that and better manage to get through those crisis.\n\nNow this can no longer be done. It simply can't. I simply don't believe in a God in the classical, common sense of the word and I certainly don't believe it is in anyway related to our concept of Goodness nor do I think it cares the slightest about us, our individuals lives or even planet. \"Praying\" would be something completely fake, there simply isn't anything there for me. But the biggest problem is not that this resource is no longer real for me. We all go through tough shit and get through it. Plus, I have good family and friends. A very small circle, it's true, but certainly valuable. What is *really* knocking me down is that I no longer have any optimism in regards to the future (of my country, of mankind, of the planet, of the future generations etc) and, crux of the matter, **I no longer feel love for others** (as in philia; i.e. fraternal love). I do feel, and that should be said emphatically because it is felt strongly, a *huge*, **deep feeling of commiseration for others**. Other humans, other generations, other living creatures, the planet etc. But love? No more. \n\nIn fact, sometimes I think I have now too much of a sort of hatred that I never had all my life growing up. Whenever I interact with people and just go on looking around in my daily life I just feel a very strong feeling of frustration. Not so much with myself, I live a fair life, but with people and with the state of things. It is a result of the triple loss: optimism, hope and love. \n\nOf course, I can still feel those things, in a personal level at least: I'm optimistic about my career; I hope that things will get better; I love some people in my life etc. But in a broader scale? One that would make me in peace with the universe and with the larger human family? Only commiseration (which makes me still try to do good instead of bad whenever I can) and frustration (which makes me in some way hate people, truly hate, and hold zero hopes for the collective future). I was having a conversation with my girlfriend and this is how I described my state of mind:\n\nImagine you somehow time travelled to the future, the far future, and you witnessed a dystopia; you were shown that this world is doomed, and then... you were brought back to your regular life in 2016. How do you live on after that?\n\nI'm not a suicidal person, *I don't even think I'm depressed*, but I definitely am not the same anymore in a rather sad way. I don't do drugs, I have tried and I don't like them, so I usually resort to music, comedy and sex to confort me when I'm feeling down. This gives me some joy for my days. But whenever I just stop and start to think, to rationalize, the sadness comes back, that feeling of emptiness and desolation. I then remember when I was a younger dude and believed that God was there and that he was good and capable of touching peoples' hearts, so I had good reason to invest love in these same people... it is such a huge contrast, I can barely recognize me at all. Today I don't believe in people, I dont' think we are good, in fact I think we as a species are rather evil and dumb by nature. I'm isolating more and more from social interactions. My \"godless\" world is also a \"optimism, love and hope\"-less world. However just putting \"god back\" feels like nothing but stupid for me. I don't start believe in Santa Claus again just because I think Christmas suck today, you know?\n\n\nI am truly a sadder, less productive and less social/likeable person today because of it. Maybe ignorance after all really is an unexchangeable bliss.\n\n\nI was wondering if other agnostics or atheists have gone or are going through a similar experience and how do you respond to it or deal with it.

        "text": "So, I have this situation where I believe in christ but part of me doesn't know and I could post this on a christian reddit but I know i'll just get \"have faith\". Anyways, this is driving me nuts because part of me likes being Christian because I look up to Jesus but a huge part of me also doesn't know for certain if an afterlife exists just because of my experiences in life. For example, I've had multiple surgeries and the anesthesia i've been under has made me realize that oblivion is possible because under that, if you don't know, it feels like nothing. no concept of time, no concept of ANYTHING, you're gone and for some that's peaceful but to me that's scary because It makes me realize that state of being is possible. \nAlso I feel I haven't done things in life that I want to because it would be deemed sinful by christians, maybe unethical to atheists too but basically an objective morality makes it hard for me to accomplish what I believe I need to achieve in order to contribute to society. Maybe i just have some unrealistic view of how my life with turn out but this is bugging me and I wish it didn't because this feeling is driving me nuts. One little example would be I've wondered if we could ever immortalize consciousness because I know genetic engineering is becoming more advanced but I'd want to go even more extreme yet i've gotten over than for the reason that it would be playing God. I also feel like trying to follow Christ has made me have to hide my self because I'll admit without christianity, I'd be more of a selfish person but in a good way although before I was a christian I was compassionate just over time after being let down by family, and things like that, after having health issues like finding out I have something wrong with my heart and after just experiencing more things and even listening to some of my friends who've been through worse things it makes me lose faith for humanity. \n\nBasically, the thought that there's not an afterlife makes me scared and want to do something about it and try to progress humanity in anyway I can but then there's the bible saying I'm not allowed to be worldly and anything and yet I feel like I have to be a little worldly and choose myself over others sometimes in order to do what I want. I've literally been stressing about this for few months and I'll have days where i'm a completely caring person but then other days where I will have no problem choosing myself over another person and feel no guilt and justify it. I don't know what to do, christians tell me have faith, pray, keep obeying the bible, and we all sin but then I see hypocritical christians doing things like hating gays or whatever  or i'll see an atheist act uncaring to someone and it makes me not want to act christ like and just forgive everyone because I do it so much that I don't want to do it anymore. Sorry if that last part of any of this didn't make sense. \n\nFurthermore, what i'm trying to say is the fact I don't know wether or not Jesus is real or not is fucking with my moral compass, part of me wants to obey the bible and keep trying to be like christ even if he isnt real and live in a way where i'm a perfect christian, not to wordly so i'm saved  but another part of me wants to sometimes lie, sometimes lust, commit necessary evils in order to actually impact the world more. Simply, a big part of me is afraid to live the life because maybe i won't make it to heaven, but then again, if there's no after life I just wasted however many years when I could've been doing something greater. I don't know what to do i've been stressing for months and this shit cannot be good for my health, mentally and physically.\n\n\n",

But there are a few I see frequently quoted, where the person quoting has completely missed the point of the verse.\n\nThe first is [Matthew 15: 1 - 11] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2015:1-11)\n\nthis is often quoted as saying Jesus is telling the Pharisees that they should be killing disobedient sons. But that's not it at all. It's very clear that he's rebuking the Pharisees for calling out his disciples about not following tradition. Jesus is saying 'You also don't follow tradition you hypocrites.' He's pointing out the hypocrisy, not chastising them for being too nice to children.\n\nAnother one is [Luke 22:36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+22:36-38), where Jesus sends out his disciple to buy swords. In context, it's clear he's telling them to do so because it will fulfill some prophecy that was written, not to cause violence. When they come back with only two swords he says that's enough because that fills the prophecy close enough.\n\nNow, I'm not saying the Bible is good or true. I'm just saying when you use these verses incorrectly in debates, you weaken your own position and show ignorance that can be used against you. \n\nAny others you can think of?",

God kills his family, livestock, and makes him severely sick.

I was given this by someone claiming prophecies in the Bible (others included Isaiah 45, Isaiah 53, and Ezekiel 37), which he claimed to be \"horrendously massive evidence supporting Biblical Christianity\".\n\nI did a bit of poking around on my own and came up with some problems I saw with it based on that, but I wanted to hear what you guys thought since I'm pretty sure quite a few of you are more informed and adept than I am at giving this claim a thorough examination. If you wanted to see the list of gripes I had about it:\n\n1.      It claims the affliction and bondage of Abraham’s descendants will last exactly 430 years. The verse it cites clearly says 400.\n2.      It arbitrarily chooses Genesis 21:8-10 as when this period of affliction begins, despite there being absolutely no mention or implication of it in the actual text.\n3.      Archaeological evidence does not support the hypothesis of Israelites ever living in ancient Egypt. This page tries to use what Paul says in the Bible instead to corroborate claims made in the Bible…it’s clear at this point that they’re taking the number 430 and working backward with it to suit the conclusion.\n4.

        "text": "I was talking with my friend who is Catholic earlier today about religion. At one point he said that he had confidence in what he believes because (as one example) there were 500 different people claiming to have witnessed the resurrection of Jesus. I didn't really know what to say to that. Is that something that's mentioned in the bible, or are there some other sources of this? He's not really one to dig hard for support to claims he hears/reads so I'm wondering if this is some exaggeration from a biased source.\n\nAside from this instance, I've heard Christians mention things about eyewitness accounts of Jesus performing miracles and I don't really know if that's something in the bible or from somewhere else. Where do they come from? Also, aside from the obvious reasons like \"people don't come back from the dead,\" why are these so-called eyewitness accounts discredited?\n\nEdit: Thanks, everyone. The fact that it's coming from someone in the bible who claims this many people saw it is enough to discredit this.",

        "text": "I've been more or less Atheist/Agnostic for the better part of my adult life. Naturally, this view ultimately leads to one thinking about death and it's 'aftermath' which is a cessation of existence from a scientific point of view. I've had it described to me as 'you're not  even experiencing nothingness' and 'it's the same as before you were born' and even 'it's like being asleep forever since you don't remember being asleep'.\n\nBut I cannot wrap my head around the idea. I have a frame of reference from when I was born, but after death...How can one just not feel anything anymore for eternity? Not even waiting in darkness, but a timeless, sensationless existence? I had thought that, if that was our end, then surely you wouldn't experience a moment of it, and given the infinite time you've skipped because you are gone, if there is another 'state' of existence, you would reach it instantly, even if you are no longer you (a quasi 'reincarnation' I suppose but there is no evidence for it).\n\nBut if there is truly nothing it makes little sense to me. I literally cannot comprehend the state of being in a state of less than nothing forever, because when you truly think about it, it seems like it should be literally impossible if you cannot truly experience it.",

        "text": "So I was raised Catholic but after reading r/atheism (regardless of your opinion on that sub) for months I became atheist when I was 16. I'm 20 now and have been pretty confident in my atheism and felt that Christianity is just a myth like the Greek myths and there is no reason to believe it over anything else. I feel that life is much better and more beautiful and free and moral being atheist.\n\nBut like two days ago, suddenly and for no real reason I can put my finger on, I got a sudden fear that maybe Christianity is true. I don't even know how I got on this thought. I have a crush on a Muslim girl at my school and I started wondering what she thought about sex outside of marriage, and I wondered how I would talk to her about this if we were to start dating. And somehow after thinking about a lot of things I suddenly started questioning everything I thought I knew and it somehow got my mind on the thought that maybe Christianity is true or partially true in some way shape or form. Don't ask me how it went from point A to point B because I have no fucking idea. Maybe it's just because I'm really stressed from schoolwork and social isolation lately and I'm tired and not thinking straight. \n\nAnd this is not a hopeful belief either, like \"yay maybe I can go to Heaven if I follow God\" or some crap like that. It is very scary because as I'm sure you all know God described in the Bible is racist, sexist, misogynistic, murderous, genocidal, vengeful, and generally horrible, and he will make anyone who does not believe in him and follow all his arbitrary rules suffer in Hell forever. I think that by any standards comprehensible to a sane human, this God is evil, so I would morally not want to worship him even if I knew he was real, and following him would mean that I would need to accept that I as a human can have no conception of morality beyond doing what I am told by an ancient book, which seems ridiculous (as a side note, I never read the whole Bible or even close to it and don't really have a desire to read it, but I have read some passages and I went to Sunday school type classes for 8 years when I was younger).\n\nSo yeah even though there is no evidence for it I am suddenly scared for some reason that it *might* be real for some weird reason, and that makes me no longer confident in my position as an atheist which leads me to question my whole life and worldview which is really not something I want to be bothered with and which I don't think would help me in any way right now. Even as I'm writing this there is a small fear in the back of my mind that God will nail me for blasphemy or something.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar, and is there any way you think I can find reassurance that Christianity is just a myth (maybe something that worked for you if had a similar thought?)?\n\nEDIT: It also doesn't help that a lot of Christians stereotype an atheist as [not someone who sees no evidence for God but] \"someone who is just angry at god\" which is probably what I sound like right now.\n\nEDIT 2: A lot of you seem to be addressing why the God of Christianity is not worth anyone's worship, because he is evil by any human standard. I already know this, my problem is that just because he is not deserving of worship, doesn't mean he isn't real. It just means he is a monster. So if he is real, it is a Catch-22 situation where you either have to be a mindless servant to an evil God, or suffer forever. Neither option is appealing. The idea of just ceasing to exist after I die is much preferable to either of those options.",
