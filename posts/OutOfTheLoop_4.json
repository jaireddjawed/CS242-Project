Because they aren't the same thing AFAIK.",

People used to edit their existing comment with notations like “ETA” or “Edit” to add onto what they initially said. Lately, I’ve seen an increase in people replying to their own comment to add onto it. Is the sole purpose of this to gain karma? That’s the only explanation I’ve been able to come up with for why this method has become popular recently. \n\nImgur link showing examples of this:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/RFEXx7S",

        "text": "I’ve been following up a bit on this situation where four Americans touring Mexico were caught up by the Mexican Gulf cartel and two of them have been killed so far plus an innocent bystander from the area. Since then, the cartels rounded up the supposed perpetrators and issued an apology letter to the Mexican authorities for the incident. Reading the comments, people are saying the cartels don’t want the attention from the U.S. authorities, but I’m failing to see why Reddit and the cartel are making a big deal out of it. Was there some history between the Mexican cartels and the U.S. that I missed that makes them scared and willing to make things right? I thought we lost the war on drugs and given it’s two U.S. American tourists as opposed to say an FBI agent who were murdered, it doesn’t sound as serious as the Mexican cartels or the news media are making it out to be because many parts of Mexico are inherently dangerous to travel to and sadly people die all the time in Mexico, which would include tourists I imagine. \n\nThis is not to say that I don’t feel bad or upset about the whole situation and feel sorry for the victims and families who are impacted by the situation, but I’m trying to figure out why the Mexican cartels are going out of their way to cooperate with the authorities on it. I doubt we’ll see a Sicario or Narcos situation out of this ordeal, but welcome your thoughts. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/11nemsx/members_of_mexicos_gulf_cartel_who_kidnapped_and/",
