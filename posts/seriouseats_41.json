        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm thinking about cooking beef wellington for my SO's family over New Year. They love fillet steak, they love roast dinners, I think it'll go over really well. Two issues: MIL doesn't like mushrooms, FIL doesn't like pate. I've made wellington without pate before and personally, I don't miss it, so I think that will be fine. But I'm not sure about omitting both mushrooms *and* pate. Between them they bring a lot of umami richness (and moisture) to the dish. So I'm wondering about substituting some other spreadable, flavourful ingredient...? I was wondering about mashed carrots/parsnips, since they're festive, or possibly a cauliflower puree with horseradish to work with the beef? But I'm having trouble imagining the end result and I thought this sub would be the place to ask for help.\n\nJust to be sure I'm within Serious Eats territory, I'll be working off [this recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/12/the-food-lab-beef-wellington-ultimate.html) which I've had great success with in the past. So prosciutto, filo, etc. I'll skip the foie gras, and I'm just looking for something to stand in for the duxelles.",

However, he omits this from the beef stew recipe. Would dry brining the chuck roast overnight be beneficial, harmful, or a negligible change? \n\nPossible pros: Better-seasoned meat; more tender meat; moister meat.\n\nPossible cons: Over-salted stew as the beef squeezes its own brine into the gravy; protein breakdown in dry brining stage leading to complete beef destruction in stewing state.\n\nPossible negation of effect: Stewing might affect the beef in orders of magnitude more than the dry brining, leading to a negligible effect in terms of flavor.\n\nAny thoughts?",

Best Buy is currently running coupon code RMNAPPLY20 for 20% all small appliances.  I checked it with the Wireless Anova, and it worked, bringing the price down to $169.99 (tax inc). That would probably put the Bluetooth only at around $130 maybe.\n\nMy biggest concern with the Bluetooth only is it's power output.  I know it's less than the WiFi.  Where is this deficiency going to make the biggest difference?  If it just takes longer for the water to warm up, then I think I'm okay with that.  If it's going to make a difference in how much meat I can cook at once, that's a little different.  On average, I cook for larger groups (for me that's like 15-20 people) about 4-5 times per year.\n\nOr, I'm I thinking about this the wrong way, and the WiFi capability is a more valuable feature?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",

I know little about cooking with rubs in a pan, are there any dos/don'ts involved in this that make it not work?  If I do go this route, is there something I could do with liquid smoke to at least give a hint of smoke flavor, even if it isn't that ideal jerk smoke flavor?  \n\n\nAs an alternative, would it be better to marinade whole thighs, cook them in the oven, and then cut it into pieces after it was cooked?  Or is some other, better way of doing this?",

Would the consistency suffer?  I'm a little worried about the bread disintegrating too much but I'm honestly not sure if that's even an issue. ",

It took another 30-45 minutes of covered cooking with the oven on 375 (to reduce burning further) until the middle was hot and tasty. Besides the burnt bits, it still came out delicious, but did I do something wrong? And if I wanted to up the size and use a 3 quart rectangular baking dish, would I just extend the covered baking part of cooking?",

I used coarse salt with the pepper and baking powder on the skin.. And it was SO delicious! In-laws raved about it. \n\nEasily the best roast chicken I've ever had. Breasts were super juicy. I pulled it a little late.. Breasts were at 160, but it was still amazing. \n\nThanks Kenji! ",
