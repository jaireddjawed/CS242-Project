Another thing you can do is work for a cruise line. My best friend worked for Holland Cruise as a Party Planner [https://www.hollandamerica.com/en\\_US/careers.html](https://www.hollandamerica.com/en_US/careers.html). She was an art history major and didn't have a party planning background, but got the job. She traveled everywhere, from Japan, Russia, Egypt, the Bahamas, New Zealand, Europe, etc. This was about ten years ago. The pay was $14/hr. Her room, food, and drink were free. She also got an allowance for her wardrobe to buy fancy dresses. In addition to this, she was able to get free cruises for her friends and family. I went on a blues music cruise with her and had an absolute blast.",

(these were gel capsules and my bin is one of the types that rotates with a hand crank). So far as I can tell, as the capsules burst over time, they neutralize the gasses the compost produces in the same way they do in our digestive system.  The difference this has made is drastic, not like a shift in the wind. It's huge.  I'm still adding basically all the same food waste I always did...the only thing that changed was that bottle of Gas-ex.

        "text": "How do I know if my internship is going well? \n\nI'm pretty confused here, and maybe it's just because I'm misreading signs or because this is my first internship. \n\nBasically I'm kinda struggling with this thing. I always deliver quality work and my boss congratulations me on my work repeatedly. So obviously this made me feel like the company is happy with me. Of all the jobs I've worked in the past, never did I have a boss that praised me for my work.\n\nHere is where things get tricky. \n\n1.  My boss lately has been pretty unresponsive and when he replies it's like a day or two late. I work remote so text is our main stream way of communicating. He reads the text but then chooses to reply when convenient for him I guess. Usually I don't have many questions, but as my workload grows,  there are some questions I have. Waiting for a reply puts me behind and following up is not helping.\n\n2. Sometimes I I don't always finish all my work and work past hours. I know it's not  an obligation to stay, but I want to make a good impact and land this job opportunity. I work past 2 days of the week at most when my work load is heavy. When this has happened, my boss hasn't seemed mad about it. He just tells me that he is impressed with my work ethic, and that I am a big asset to the company. He also tells me not to worry too much about my pacing because it will get faster as I go along. \n\n3. I was invited to a networking event and was promised a free ticket and travel and lodge paid for. But then at a last minute notice, I  was told the company would not be able to pay for my travel and lodge as promised. The reason provided to me for this decision was that they had low ticket sales and in an effort to cut costs they were forced to make this decision.  I was told that if I wanted to go to the event, I was welcome to, but had to pay for everything which at the moment I'm not in a position to do. I was given this information a day after a meeting about the event that included everyone on the team except me. \n\n\n3. A friend of mine told me that a way to know if your internship is going well is if I'm given new tasks. This is something I am experiencing and I deliver when given new tasks. \n\n\nDoes it sound like they're happy with me? My boss only has positive feedback and  when I ask if there is anything I should improve on, he say, \"no\".\n\nWhy is my boss all of a sudden responding so late?\n\nIs being cut from the event and excluded from the meeting a sign they're  not happy with me?\n\nAre they just using me because I'm an intern working for free who can lighten their workload?",

The medicine was over $400 a month plus the vet visits on top of that and my family couldn‚Äôt afford to keep him. \n\nWhen I got my first dog two years ago (same breed), I immediately got pet insurance and shelled out for a really big policy (costs $70/mo where I live now - some cost as little as $15/mo). Yesterday he was diagnosed with Juvenile Cataracts, which may require surgery later in his life and will require more ongoing (and expensive) vet visits. Because I got the insurance before this condition was diagnosed, it‚Äôs covered. They normally do NOT cover pre-existing conditions and you will continue having to pay out of pocket. \n\nNow my costs are capped at $70/mo (with some nominal increases each year), and a $500/yr deductible. That‚Äôs far more affordable than the thousands I‚Äôll have to spend on a surgery or ongoing costs to manage it.",

        "text": "Having a small bottle brush on super glue (‚Äúcyanoacrylate glue‚Äù or ‚ÄúKrazy Glue‚Äù) is incredibly useful for sealing small wounds like cuts or scratches as it essentially creates an artificial scab. This may be common knowledge; especially people in food service where band-aids are always a bit of a concern to wear, but I thought I‚Äôd share in case anyone didn‚Äôt know. There is a hospital-grade cyanoacrylate glue specifically designed for sealing small wounds, but it‚Äôs very similar to the normal off the shelf stuff, just with a ‚Äòhospital-grade‚Äô price tag. \n\nProcess: Wipe off any blood and foreign objects, brush on a light coat of super glue, gently blow on the glue to speed up the dry time. Once it‚Äôs dry (about 10-20 seconds) you can brush on an additional coat, especially if it‚Äôs a larger wound or is actively bleeding. \n\nPros:\n\n+ Stops bleeding almost instantly\n\n+ Relatively waterproof once dried\n\n+ Provides more protection against bumps than a soft band-aid\n\n+ Easier to apply to awkward areas than a band-aid\n\n+ Smaller and less visible than a band-aid as it sets clear\n\n+ Smaller to store than a box of band-aids or a small bandage\n\n+ I‚Äôve personally found that the pain from the wound subsides a lot more quickly when compared with just applying a band-aid\n\n+ I‚Äôve found that while I may need to replace a band-aid once every 1-2 days, the glue spot lasts usually a 2-3 days (depending on the area) and can be ‚Äòpainted over‚Äô if it starts to crack\n\nCons: \n\n- Doesn‚Äôt allow the wound to breathe as much\n\n- It doesn‚Äôt work as well on joints or areas of skin prone to stretching as the glue does not \nstretch once dried.\n\n- More expensive than band-aids, may need to be replaced more frequently if the bottle dries \nout\n\n- Applicator brush can get bloodied if you don‚Äôt wipe the blood away before using it\n\n- Can sting during the drying period\n\n- Some people may be allergic to cyanoacrylate\n\nHope this helps at least someone!\n\nOh, and ffs go to the hospital if it's a major wound. No amount of superglue is going to fix a missing leg.",
