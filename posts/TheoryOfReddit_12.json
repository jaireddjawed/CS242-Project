        "text": "I've recently posted three new threads onto two big subreddits (two on /r/AskReddit and one on /r/ShowerThoughts), and got almost zero response even though the threads are exactly the kind of thing you'd expect Redditors to upvote at least moderately.\n\nI made sure with at least two of them to post early in the day, around 9am EST, just as is generally recommended to maximize a thread's chances.\n\n Here are the three threads:\n\n* [People of Reddit, what is the \"Eye of Sauron\" of your life, the thing you most struggle to overcome?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7xqph3/people_of_reddit_what_is_the_eye_of_sauron_of/) (posted this at about 9:30 to 9:45 am today, and am shocked that it has barely received any attention at all)\n\n* [What's the most arrogant sounding title you could give yourself that's still true?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7xa5za/whats_the_most_arrogant_sounding_title_you_could/)\n\n* [If we started liking hipsters, then they'd become popular, in which case they would have to start hating themselves. Thus, the kindest thing we can do for hipsters is to hate them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/7x69p5/if_we_started_liking_hipsters_then_theyd_become/)\n\nI'm starting to feel like either (1) Reddit severely penalizes all new accounts or (2) that my specific account has some kind of black mark on it for no apparent reason (like maybe by accident or some kind of false positive).\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nIt's starting to feel like it can't just be coincidence. I see plenty of really mundane and duplicated threads that get attention, yet these ones I made that I carefully designed to appeal to Redditors aren't getting any real traction whatsoever.\n\nAnother thought: Is it possible that my thread creation visibility is partially shadow banned, whereas my comment posting is not? Do they do that to users sometimes? \n\nPossibly related, or not: One of my first two posts on my account was a link to wikipedia that got stuck in moderation as \"spam\" though. It was just a link to the impostor syndrome page, but was marked as suspicious by the system or some user. I talked to the mods and they let it through because it was extremely obviously innnocent. Could that have given me some kind of idiotic black mark on my account?\n\nSomething else I'm remembering now: I also had an old account that linked to 3 or 4 Amazon pages on one post when someone explicitly asked for computer science book recommendations. I did it purely for their convenience and because other users were getting away with it. That post got marked as spam too (much less of a surprise). I talked to the mods and they agreed it was completely innocent and let it through. Afterwards, that account began working normally and was able to get plenty of upvotes on subreddits. Thus, maybe it isn't a problem. Or, maybe the system still remembers. I don't know.\n\nAnother point: I have gilded someone once, as a joke, so I count as a paying customer technically. I would think this would work in my favor and make me less likely to have my posts completely ignored, but apparently not.\n\nI'm really mystified by all this. I'm starting to feel like the site is rigged against me somehow.\n\nAnother theory: Maybe it has gotten to the point where only users that cheat or pay for upvotes are able to ever reach top in the big subreddits. I'm pretty regularly surprised at how banal and obvious and duplicated a bunch of the top posts are compared to a bunch of the other threads that don't get attention.\n\nAnother theory: Could there by some kind of seniority system that is making it impossible for posts to stand on their own merits unless the user is both old and has high karma. It feels like nothing ever works.\n\nOh, and I also have like 5 different user accounts, but I don't use any of the other ones anymore. Could that be having an impact?\n\nWhat are your thoughts? \n\nThanks for your time.",

        "text": "I have found that posts of people that are part of marginalized subcultures are seemingly viewed as underdogs to many on Reddit, and will be fervently defended, even when it does not make sense in the context of a post showing these people doing and saying things that are disreputable. \n\nEdit: When I say subcultures I do not mean races. I mean ideas of Punks, Skaters, Metal heads, Rappers, and essentially any other culture that has had negative connotations associated with their perceived lifestyles. My experience is that it is seen as unfair and untrue that these subcultures behave in negative ways, that they have been inaccurately represented by our media and in fact they are healthy, constructive environments for kids to be brought up around. \n\nFor example, today on the front page there is a post about a mother who took her daughter to a skate park and was initially deterred when she arrived and found the park filled with nothing but teenage boys who were smoking and swearing. She was surprised when one of them took an hour out to show her daughter how to skate properly. The thread quickly filled up with people stating how skaters like to help people and the community is really inclusive. However I grew up around many skaters and bikers in the New England area. I went to the skate park a lot as a teenager and found the experience to be, ultimately, nonconstructive and lacking a healthy environment, personally. I pointed this out to someone who commented on the post stating the mother was an asshole for presuming and stereotyping the skaters. From my perspective however, this was the exactly the kind of stereotype I witness on a daily basis. Many of the people at my local skate parks did very little with their lives and committed too much time to skating and biking. I pointed out in the post that the mother was correct in being worried as when she arrived to a park where she wanted her daughter to experience a healthy activity they encountered an unhealthy environment: smoking, being physically unhealthy, and swearing being unsportsmanlike. I was quickly attacked by people saying I was wrong and that skaters mainly want to help and are a supportive community that embraces people... but it all depends on your own experience and in my experience I saw more negativity in my life with this community and wanted to be objective in my analysis of what information the post itself contained. \n\nSkaters in this instance became the marginalized subculture that was unfairly being stereotyped. Upon me pointing out that these people were in fact embodying certain stereotypes and that this person was, in my opinion, an aberration I was attacked by people who were offended at my comment. ",

Most people fall into two camps when it comes to talking about politics: either A) completely removed and just fed up with it, or B) engaged in politics very furiously, trying to do the right thing but often just making the opposition angry. This second group does the opposite of what users on r/CMV do, they’re not convincing people but trying to be “right” or “stand up for the truth”. I put these thoughts and many more into [a video about talking about politics](https://youtu.be/mxgOjH7szdk), with the use of data from Reddit and that paper above. **Would love to hear your thoughts on the video, and to what extent you think the lessons from r/CMV could be applied to the rest of Reddit and even in outside political discussions.**\n",

        "text": "I stumbled across this Simon Pegg quote earlier today which reminded me of something I've been thinking about for a while:\n\n&gt;“Obviously I’m very much a self-confessed fan of science-fiction and genre cinema. But part of me looks at society as it is now and thinks we’ve been infantilised by our own taste. We’re essentially all consuming very childish things – comic books, superheroes… Adults are watching this stuff, and taking it seriously!\n\n&gt;“It is a kind of dumbing down because it’s taking our focus away from real-world issues. Films used to be about challenging, emotional journeys. Now we’re really not thinking about anything, other than the fact that the Hulk just had a fight with a robot.” \n\nI have a theory about this sort of thing which I've been sitting on for some time. On top of stuff like “adults getting excited about superheroes,\" I think this theory explains things like adult fascination with [ball pits](https://xkcd.com/150/) and [blanket forts](https://imgur.com/a/XvYya), or why there's a cache of nerf guns at my office, or how I know several people in their 30s who own fidget spinners, or the recent growth of the adult Lego community.\n\nHere goes:\n\n1. People are tribal by nature. They want to be part of the [\"in group\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity), and one way these groups are identifiable is by [cultural signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm)\n2. Exposure to lots of people saying they like something makes a person more likely to get into it themselves. On some level, they hear: \"everyone else in my tribe is really into this thing. There must be something to it. I feel left out right now, and I want to be 'in' again.\" For more detail on the psychology of this, check out [social influence theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_influence)\n1. When people read 1st person narratives, they tend to visualize the author as [similar to themselves](http://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narrative-empathy).\n2. Commentary online is disproportionately produced by [younger people](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/5700sj/octhe_results_of_the_reddit_demographics_survey/) who generally have more time, opportunity, and desire to goof off online than adults with jobs and families and other obligations.\n3. Most of this commentary is anonymous or pseudo anonymous. Consequently, adults don't know when they're interacting with children or teens online, and probably do so was more often than they realize. \n4. Adults consequently get exposed to a lot of younger people taking about what they like. They interpret this on some level as: \"other people like childish stuff, I should too so I won't be an outsider,\" incorrectly assuming these \"other people\" are adults when they're often not.\n5. The result of this blurred/lack of border between adult and youth spaces online has been youth culture increasingly influencing adult culture to the point that it's getting increasingly difficult to distinguish the two.\n\nI'm not pushing a value judgement here: whether or not this is good or bad is a completely separate conversation (which I'd be happy to engage in the comments). I'm just proposing a mechanism for how this came about.\n\nEDIT: /u/Mantipath and /u/dreamfall17 raise good points, which can be summarized as: \n\n&gt; \"You only attribute that stuff to 'youth culture' because it was *your* youth culture. The youth culture of yesterday necessarily influences the adult culture of today.\" \n\nThat's a really good point and I don't have a good argument against it. I don't work with kids or have any of my own, and my friends' kids are all toddlers, so I'm definitely not an expert in contemporary youth culture. That said, I'm clearly not the only person who believes this \"infantilization\" phenomenon is real: at least Simon Pegg sees it too (not that he's an expert either). I'm at work so I don't have time to poke around, but I'm fairly confident I've read articles over the last few years discussing this as well.\n\nYou're probably correct to criticize some of the specific examples I cited as biased by my own childhood. But I'd still assert that adults today value \"childishness\" in a way that other generations didn't previously. Consider the workplace for example: pretty much every generation prior to ours put much more value in a kind of serious professionalism which has been relegated to only certain occupations today. I'm probably the only person I know my age who owns a briefcase, and I only know a handful of people who are expected to wear a suit to work. Hell, most people I know wear jeans and colorful shirts around the office, and I was actually *specifically* advised against dressing up for my last job interview. Obviously a case can be made that this is a shift in business culture specifically, but I think it's a symptom of this larger cultural shift I alluded to above. \n\nMy post presupposes that this shift has happened and then moves forward discussing a theorized mechanism, so if people disagree that the phenomenon I'm trying to explain is even real then I guess I should've put more effort into finding sources to back up the existence of the phenomenon to begin with. I'll try to get around to that research later tonight, but I probably won't have the time :(",

        "text": "I'm confident anyone reading this has come across typical back and forths, and very likely been part of one, about a certain complex or difficult subject. Some of you might have started to notice the trends, how people clinged to specific words and wouldn't give room for people to correct themselves (something essential in oral language, which is what most comments and discussions on Reddit or conversations in WhatsApp emulate and should be compared to). In addition, in a lot of cases it seemed people weren't focused on addressing the issue, but to get into a discussion. Ignoring the original point and letting it go, being unwilling to compromise to move the conversation forwards etc. In oral language it is much more unlikely, as there always is an implicit agreement of cooperation (think how you ask for clarification, for instance, not to 'win' the argument, but to understand.)\n\nSo, I think the people commenting now have improved a lot on these. It's becoming more and more natural for people to read and treat comments as things people *say*, not something that is subject to the standard and rules of written language. \n\nDo you agree or disagree? I'll attempt to find examples and post them when I get back, but I think this has the potential to be very interesting, even if I'm wrong. ",

        "text": "It's been a weird couple years on this website.\n\nThere have always been trolls and fights and disagreements on reddit, but there's been a marked shift in tone over the past, say, 36 months. I moderate a big meta sub (/r/subredditdrama) so I see it firsthand, both in the fights we link to and in our comments themselves.\n\nThere's also been an uptick in complaints about \"mod bias\", \"censorship\", and \"safe spaces\". The terms *hugbox* and *echo chamber* get tossed around a lot. There're whole subreddits dedicated to **not being PC!**\n\nI think there are lots and lots of reasons for this, but I'd like to pick apart two in particular.\n\n**1: there's an expectation on the part of some redditors that their uncivil tone will be separated from their unpopular but somewhat legitimate opinion**\n\nConsider two different posts:\n\n&gt;it makes me very uncomfortable to share a bathroom with someone who was born the opposite sex from me. It just feels wrong to me, y'know? That's why I support \"bathroom laws\".\n\nvs\n\n&gt;\"Hello! Is this 411? Hi I'd just like to know which bathroom is for people born with dicks? The MEN'S BATHROOM? **PEOPLE WITH PENISES GO IN THE FUCKING MENS BATHROOM?** OK thanks!\" *This is your brain on liberalism.*\n\nI've repeatedly seen the first perfectly allowed on places like /r/politics. I disagree with that view, but it's a view held by a bunch of US Senators! The second is a cruel attack on trans people with a flippant dismissal tacked onto the end, and it would get removed for basic incivility in a lot of \"neutral\" subreddits.\n\nAnd when it does, the folks posting it return to their \"un-PC\" subs and complain about mod bias in neutral subs. \n\n**2: relatedly, the coarsening of discourse in America has been a vicious cycle, and we see it played out on reddit**\n\nLet's face it: American liberalism is proudly strident. Fighting for basic rights is empowering; calling traditionalist Christians who disagree with marriage equality \"bigots\" feels *good*; taking on institutional racism is *simply the right thing to do*.\n\n(note again: I mod a smuggy-ass place like SRD. I see this played out alllllll the time.) \n\nThat tone, though - unapologetic - has been matched and ratcheted up by the same people liberals had in their sights eighteen months ago. Blithe condescension is the norm, even and especially as you confront your ideological enemies. How often do we see\n\n&gt;waycizmmm! muh soggy knee!! SHARIABLUE!!!\n\nCombine those habits with reddit subs' rules enforcing civility, and you end up with PC Liberal Bias Mods Censoring Opposing Viewpoints. ",

Say someone crossposts to another sub, I look at the crosspost, and regardless of the agenda of the crossposter, if the original thread seems like an interesting discussion, I might click and go to the original (crossposted) submission. \n\nWhile reading through that thread I might want to make a reply to a comment or two, and maybe even upvote something.\n\nIt is not clear to me - would that be a violation of some Reddit rule?\n\n-----\n\nWouldn't be going into a crossposted thread, commenting or upvoting be no different than if I did the same coming from /r/all? That is, you are allowed to, so long as it's not part of a brigade (another can of worms, imo since I know I am not a mind reader, so I cannot predict future brigades.)  Speaking of gray areas.. Reddit has a rarely given Bellwether award for hanging out on the new queue and flagging (voting?) carefully - I used to do that, hang out in /r/all/new/ and occasionally upvote what I thought was good, and downvote what I thought was junk - until I was suspended for upvoting a submission that was brigaded a day later. Naturally I stopped because when I asked the admins about it I was given NO guidance whatsoever other than be told to fuck off in so many words.\n\nAnyway.. back on track:\n\nLike I said, this crossposting thing is new, and it doesn't look like there is any real clarity, that I could find at least, on what can or cannot be done with respect to the crossposted content (as if there is any real clarity on just about anything when it comes anything said by anyone from Reddit's administration, but again I digress.)\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

I'm not sure if its a fixed or variable time for each gilding, so I have given 6 gildings and it says 23.13 hours. So rounding to 6 a day, ~240 days in 7.66 months, 1,440 gildings.

It allows hegemons to fester and cause problems within communities just as much as spam and generally stupid user submissions does.\n\nAnd to this day, there is still nothing that can be done to counteract it. Reddit has no checks &amp; balances system to moniter the decisions that moderators make, no user option to report and investigate instances of moderator abuse, nor the privilege of submitting an appeal if you feel that a decision was not rightfully made.\n\nAll there is, is modmail; great idea right? Said moderator is a total ass in real life, consistently harasses you, bans you for questioning said harassment, and all you get for your troubles is an automated messege suggesting that speaking through modmail would be a feasable option. Yes, this can work (depending on the calibre of some other moderator who may check the mailbox before the abusive moderator in question), but majority of the time it probably won't; this is simply considering the fact that this system is no more productive than sending a return letter to someone that sent you a death threat in the mail. Keep in mind as well that the recipient of your modmail is totally anonymous, and usually the sidebar or FAQ of whatever subreddit you're on doesn't actually inform you on who the moderators actually are, making it difficult to speak to one directly.\n\nWhat do you think could be done about this issue, and how well do you think it would work?",

They would make their responses as objective and verifiable as possible, but not list sources (since most Reddit comments do not either.)\n\nThen they or another group do the same thing, but they intentionally plant misinformation instead. They would again try to make them as objectively wrong as possible, while being phrased in a confident, reasonable sounding way. Possibly could make variations on how it's presented, e.g. whether or not they DO reveal their credentials, post sources that discuss the topic but do not support their statement, cheerfully, slightly condescendingly, insultingly, etc.\n\nThen record data on which are received better, and come up with a way to judge what percentage are generally accepted by the voters, and how the variables affect this.\n\nI know this is sort of pointless and wouldn't really show too much that we don't already know, but I think it would be a popular post if the results were collected validly and presented in an easy to digest format. It would be interesting to see, and may help to bring awareness to the many people who blindly accept anything they read here.\n\nThoughts?",

I've seen users and non-users tell me to chill out because \"it's a circlejerk sub.\"\n\nMy feeling is that while the posters are often not being 100% serious, they're not being ironic (as in posting things and meaning the opposite). They're actually fully supporting their political beliefs, albeit sometimes in an exaggerated way. Not 100% of r/FULLCOMMUNISM is slavishly devoted to Kim Jong Un, but they probably do all sympathize with him a lot more than the average person.\n\nWhat's the effect on discourse? Is it pushing us further apart politically? Am I overthinking it?",

        "text": "/r/sex is the primary sex-related subreddit on reddit. For the most part, it's a useful and friendly community which is generally open-minded and willing to help people out with their sex-related problems. Generally I would say that they contribute more positive than negative things to reddit, and this post isn't intended to denounce the subreddit as completely useless.\n\nHowever, they have a disturbing habit when it comes to one particular subject, and one that I think is damaging their subscribers for the sake of maintaining a positive atmosphere.\n\nOn the subject of penis size, /r/sex suffers from the issue of **Toxic Positivity**. Most of you are probably already familiar with the toxic *negativity* of subreddits like TD or r/drama, and that doesn't need a definition. Toxic *Positivity* occurs when a subreddit promotes and officially endorses a very positive, nice-sounding view on a subject to the detriment of legitimate discussion and information gathering.\n\nIn the case of /r/sex and penis size, the Toxic Positivity manifests in the following way: \n\n1. A woman or a sexually successful man will post a thread on the subject of penis size, generally carrying the message that size doesn't matter, big dicks hurt, and good sex is all about technique. A recent thread on this subject illustrates the point: [From a woman who prefers smaller penises to men who are insecure about them](https://np.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/7nrp5t/from_a_woman_who_prefers_smaller_penises_to_men/)\n\n2. The majority of upvoted comments are nice-sounding reassurances agreeing with the OP and telling men that the size issue is all in their head: [Example](https://np.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/7nrp5t/from_a_woman_who_prefers_smaller_penises_to_men/ds4b6ca/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=sex)\n\n3. When sorting by controversial, more truthful, less flattering comments about penis size come to light, often making people uncomfortable: [Example 1](https://np.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/7nrp5t/from_a_woman_who_prefers_smaller_penises_to_men/ds4a5x0/), [Example 2](https://np.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/7nrp5t/from_a_woman_who_prefers_smaller_penises_to_men/ds5jo6f/), [Example 3](https://np.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/7nrp5t/from_a_woman_who_prefers_smaller_penises_to_men/ds47ifk/), [Example 4](https://np.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/7nrp5t/from_a_woman_who_prefers_smaller_penises_to_men/ds5fcae/)\n\n4. Veteran users of /r/sex who want to continue to maintain the illusion of positivity go into full-on denial mode, accusing those of saying that size matters of either lying or being in a minority: [Example](https://np.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/7nrp5t/from_a_woman_who_prefers_smaller_penises_to_men/ds4rmb7/)\n\nEventually, the thread dies down, and new discussion about the subject is stifled by the fact that AutoModerator removes most threads about penis size.\n\nBased on both the deliberate attempts to censor truthful discussion and the [disastrous results smaller men have when they take the subreddit's advice](https://np.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/66yjv5/terrible_first_experience_girl_walked_out_after/), I conclude that **/r/sex is suffering from a form of Toxic Positivity that stifles discussion, spreads untruthful information, and puts many of their readers in a position to have extremely negative sexual experiences due to the misinformation provided on the subject of penis size.** Size obviously matters, and the continued refusal of /r/sex to acknowledge the truth to avoid making people uncomfortable is damaging to both the readers and the active members of the subreddit. \n\n\nIn short, Toxic Positivity can be just as dangerous as toxic negativity, as both present a false view of the world that will likely lead a person to severe cognitive dissonance when the views meet reality.
