Shadow's around 7 years of age now, has had many offspring and she herself is very clingy. \n\nEver since we lived in our old house (around 4-5 years ago) Shadow would, of course, try and come into our bedrooms at night to sleep with us. When I would push her gently out of the room, pick her up and put her out or shut the door, when I would turn around, there she was. She'd be lying on my bed or just walking behind me; meowing at something.\n\nThe only way I've ever been able to explain this before is that we mistake Shadow for her younger friends; Shiba or Gus. Shiba looks a lot like Shadow in both features and her body, and Gus isn't too far off from a distance. These situations, however, occurred even back when we didn't have these two cats. They continued even after moving house. I would see her in my room, but as I shut the curtains, she'd be in the garden too, roaming around. There was a few times where I could swear I was able to see her twice, like for example when we feed the cats together (I have 8 at this moment in time) and I'd see her in the room, leave, then as I walked back to my bedroom she'd come galloping down the stairs. \n\nI don't know if this is a glitch, I just made an account solely for the sake of posting about these weird events that I'm starting to get less and less able to explain (without seeming like I'm crazy to most).",

It wasn't a scary experience it was just a \"WTF\" moment that I still recall to this day.\n\nAs I was saying, I was pretty young and decided to go upstairs to watch some late night cartoons. It was a weekend, so my parents would let me stay up later that usual. I was wearing my favorite purple pajamas, (pants and long sleeves, it got pretty cold upstairs) and I had an old wool blanket covering me. I fell asleep on the couch watching some cartoons (I'm sure it must have been Sailor Moon), my parents certainly went upstairs to watch some TV and probably let me sleep there as they wouldn't want to carry me downstairs to put me to bed, I always pretended to be asleep so I wouldn't have to walk lol\n\nAnyways, woke up the next morning BUTT NAKED, purple PJs nowhere to be found, I freaked out a little. When I went downstairs wrapped in my old blanket, got into my bedroom and there they were... Neatly folded on my bed like I had never wore them.\n\nI never understood how or why it happened, asked my parents about it and they knew nothing about it. Nothing like that has ever happened to me and I hope nothing ever does, I freak out a lot over these things.",

About three weeks after we all turn in our books and our essays, my friend, the same friend with the Supreme MetroCard from my other post, finds a copy of Romeo and Juliet in his bag. He says this is weird, because he remembers giving in his book. Now there's one thing you need to understand. Because everyone's book was logged, there's no way he could've just \"forgotten.\" If he did, our teacher would've reminded him about it. She would've either reminded him about the book until he brought it in, or told him to pay for it. And being that I sit next to him, I would've heard if the teacher told him those things. Either way, that couldn't have been his book under normal circumstances. Ergo, the glitch. Or maybe someone's book somehow wound up in his bag. Either way, it makes for a pretty good story.",

        "text": "For some background, I live in the town I attend college in and I go to my southern hometown every now and then to visit my family for holidays, birthdays, eye doctor appointments, just-cause-I-haven't-had-a-homemade-meal-in-forever visits, etc etc. My parent's house is on what is officially referred to as a \"plantation\", but is actually more like a country club with houses along the golf course and wooded areas. After the last of their parents passed away, my grandparents decided they should move back to my hometown and focus on their grandchildren. Incidentally, a house close by was for sale, and they bought it. \n\n[Map path.](http://imgur.com/a/CXtFm)The top point is my parent's house and the other point is my grandparent's. I always stop by my grandparent's house to say goodbye last before I leave to go back to college, especially since my grandma is definitely a worrier and wants to know exactly when I leave and when I get home no matter if it's my second trip or my twenty-second. She probably spends the whole time I'm on the road checking the clock, so it's easier to leave from her place instead of somewhere else so I don't have to worry about texting or calling her during the drive. Plus sometimes my grandpa gives me gas money, so that's a plus.\n\nThis day in particular, my sister (who still lives with my parents on account of being a young single mom of two) had made plans with my grandma for my grandma to come and pick up my niece so my sister could run errands since I wouldn't be there to watch her anymore. I wasn't aware of this, so in my hurry to get on the road before it got dark, I left for my grandparents' at the same time my grandma left for my parents'. I didn't encounter a single car on the road, especially not my grandma's silver Navigator (I know for sure that's what it is because she always jokes that her Navigator must actually be clear instead of silver because people never seem to notice her car on the road and constantly pull out in front of her and cut her off). \n\nWhen I got to my grandparents', I walked into their house to find my grandpa looking confused because my grandma had just left with the gas money he told her to give me, figuring I was due to leave soon since I usually leave a few hours before it gets dark. I said I hadn't seen her on the road and she obviously wasn't at my parents' house, and her called her phone to check on her (he's a worrier too) but she didn't answer. I was confused, but still took the chance to tell my grandpa bye and then drove back to my parents' house. \n\nMy grandma's car was in the driveway and she was standing in the yard with my mom watching my niece play. I got out of my car and hugged her and questioned how she'd gotten past me on the way there. There's a gas station and a Dollar General not too far from the main plantation exit past my house, so honestly I figured she'd gone to fuel up or grab some groceries and then came to my parents' house. Nope, she said she'd gone straight there and had gone \"the usual way\". Plus that would've added at least five more minutes to the drive. She also remarked that she hadn't seen any other car on the way there. Everyone just kind of shrugged it off and moved on to telling me bye, but I still felt weird about it and still wonder how it could've happened now and then, leading to my posting this. \n\nI'm trying to anticipate any of you guys poking holes in my story, so here goes: My grandma is over 80 and thus has touches of dementia here and there like forgetting things from just a few days before but really not something big enough to get her lost on a straight shot two minute drive. I guess she could've lied about where she'd driven, but I don't know why or how she'd done it. With such a short time between one house and the other, there's not many places she could've gone and still make the timeframe. Plus, my grandma doesn't really lie. She's a very Christian and open lady. The extent of guilt she allows into her life is sometimes getting a $1 fry from McDonald's when she's already out and not telling my grandpa, because he'll want her to get him a cheeseburger but she doesn't want him to risk his cholesterol. The only thing I could think of is she could've pulled into one of the other streets en route to my parents' house. She has some church friends on a couple of those streets, but why would she lie about that? Even if she was say, cheating on my grandpa or something, she could still say she was just visiting someone from church real quick and no one would think anything. But really, I don't think I've ever heard that woman lie. \n\nLet me know if any of you have any ideas or questions. I would really appreciate it.",

When I was younger, my grandparents had a home  in a small mountain range about an hour from where I live, which my parents and I would often visit. This home is very old, the backyard is essentially a forest, and the electric and other utilities are quite dated. Occasionally, my parents would invite friends (and their kids) to come up and visit for a weekend or so. \n\nOnce, I was up there with my parents, a friend (who I will call \"Laura\") and her family. Laura's dad is an immigrant from Eastern Europe, and he spoke with an accent. Laura is American, she has no accent. \n\nSo when I was playing there with Laura, her dad came up to us and began speaking in another language to Laura. Laura responded, also not in English. I was taking Spanish lessons at the time and I remember it was not Spanish either. Once they finished speaking (it was a short conversation) Laura and I went back to playing. I wanted to know what they were talking about, but was old enough to know that if Laura's dad spoke to her in another language then their conversation was private. So I waited for a little while, and asked Laura \"What other languages do you speak?\"  Laura looked at me with surprise. She told me she doesn't speak anything besides English. This in turn surprised me. I asked again, and she maintained that she didn't speak anything else. \n\nA few years later when we were at the end of middle school, I asked Laura if she speaks any other languages again. She told me she was just starting to learn French that year. That and English are all she knows. I still swear she was speaking another language with her father. \n\n",

I was knocked onto my back by the shockwave...\n\nAs I got up I thought, \"Oh crap! I just died or got seriously injured in every other universe!\" and walked back into the hotel, visibly shaken.\n\nAll I wanted to do was go to my room. I passed the 18 yro male desk clerk I had grown to know over the previous 12 days. I went to the right then the second right and then... the doorway and the hallway to my side of the hotel... it wasn't there! It was just a wall!\n\nI FReAKED OUT and I thought \"OH crAP! I'm having a QUANTUM IMMORTALITY MOMENT!\" and I proceeded to walk immediately to the front desk... I\n\nThe guy was gone, replaced by an early-20s young woman I'd never seen before. I flipped around, retraced the steps I'd taken dozens of times over the last 2 weeks, but alas, I was confronted with the same wall.\n\nIn a mild but increasing panic, I made my way back to the front desk.\n\n\"Where's room 232?!\" I asked the girl.\n\n\"There is no 232... What's your name?\"\n\n&lt;I give her my name and checkin date&gt;\n\n\"Sir, I'm sorry. I don't see your name in the system.\"\n\nI got really agitated with that, and I felt the best thing for me to do was to get regrounded, in the spiritual/metaphysical sense. So I walked outside into the near-freezing North England air. I could not see the gas station I had just come from, not the McDonalds or the KFC  that were all next to the hotel, none of it. It was just grass and trees and then the highway. It was very disturbing... So I sat on the bench out front and I started meditating.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later, my girlfriend drove up. I opened my eyes and looked up for the first time and immediately saw the McDonals, KFC and gas station. I told her everything. We walked inside. The guy was back! My room was back!\n\nNow here's the kicker... I told this story on /r/MandelaEffect before using my hopeseekr account. Because it was immediately after this day in December 2015 that a great many Mandela Effects were first observed by me, including Kit-Kat going to KitKat.\n\nI can no longer find this post... \n\nWhat's more, when I go to Google Maps and type in \"Premier Inn Stockton-on-Tees\" and I get this: https://goo.gl/maps/gYLwUxyKMBx\n\nIt is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than the Google Map I saw in 2016 when writing about this!!! There is no McDonalds, no KFC, no gas station, just empty plots of land, and the building is no longer shaped like a C but more like a Z.\n\nSo I think I may have shifted back to that reality sometime since moving to Hyderabad, India, in July 2016...",

I'm pretty baffled. I know I couldn't have missed the zipper tab since when I closed it the first time I had my finger and thumb pinched around the whole zipper base to close it as easy as possible so if the tab had been there I would have felt it if I didn't see it.

My room is in the basement at this house I remember it was a Thursday afternoon and I had just got home from work so after a shower, dinner and chatting it up with my family I came downstairs to relax and watch random you tube videos like I always did I clearly remember looking at my phone and it was 6:30 pm the sun was still coming in through the windows so I zoned out on the video i was watching I swear not 15 minutes went by and when I checked the time again it was 5:23 am I freaked out and thought i had actually fallen asleep but my hair was still wet. In a panic I ran upstairs only to find everyone asleep. I know some people might say \"oh well you just fell asleep and didn't remember \" well first my hair was still wet from the shower and my phone hardly got any charge. I've never really told anyone because I know my family would call me crazy and tell me to shut up.",

The house we lived in had 2 floors all the bedrooms were on the second floor when this happened I was in my parents room watching tv and talking with my mom when we start hearing someone walking up the stairs when they finally reach up stairs it's my grandma she says hi and says she needs to use the restroom so she walks over and closes the door about 10 minutes later we hear someone again walking up the stairs and guess who it is? My grandma. I remember the feeling I had so vividly that I've never been able to forget it. She says hi again and says she needs to use the restroom thats when my mom asks her why she hadn't used it the first time she walked in and my grandma gets this confused look and says \"i just got here i walked here from your sisters house.\" After she closed the door to the restroom my mom shot me a glance like \"are we crazy or did that really happen?\" I'm convinced that was a glitch.",

Weekly for sure but one in particular was so insane I just had to post it.  I feel as if the only explanation was a glitch in the matrix.\n\nThe story:\n\nthis is one of the most profound and mind blowing coincidences I have ever experienced, at the beginning of my shift delivering pizzas on the morning of Tuesday, April 25 I took a delivery to Dixon Avenue in DuBois pa, and I forgot my \"Bank\" (the change needed for customers) as I begin my delivery I turn on episode 333 of TESD  (tell em Steve Dave a podcast that I love) and as I make my way to said delivery I listen to Bry and Q talk about the number 86, they talk about this number in great length… I show up to my delivery and walk up 2 flights of steps only to be told I needed change for this guys $20 bill I told him sure it's no problem I'll run back to dominos and get it.   But I decided it would be much faster to get change at the NAPA auto parts store just adjacent from his house. So I got back in my car and hit play and continued listening to TESD talk about the #86  I grab the change from NAPA , a 10, a 5, &amp; 5 ones. I didn't look at this money at all I simply put it into my pocket and went onward, I proceed back to the guys house, and up his stairs in the process I reached in my pocket and grabbed the $3 that I owed him without looking I knocked on his door and held the money in my hands flat, and in a presentable fashion, as I knock on his door I proceed to look at the money and what I see simply blows my mind right out of the back of my skull,   The #86 was written on the first dollar bill that was sitting in my hand. IN PEN!!!!! What are the odds????  The chances of me personally pulling out that $1 dollar bill is about 20% out of the 5 that I had but that percentage is much greater when you consider all of the $1 bills in circulation and the number of those that may or may not have that number written on them, but one specifically landed in my possession on that morning whilst hearing my favorite podcast talk about that numbers significance ",

        "text": "CW: Animal death, animal abuse maybe? This is a really sad story anyway.\n\nWhen I was about 14, my dad got my little brother a pair of baby turtles from the pet shop. As it tends to happen with children, he gradually stopped taking much care of them, so my mom took the responsibility. Everything was fine until one day she took them out on the roof so they could get some sunlight (our house has easy access to the roof for hanging our laundry and stuff) and asked me to keep an eye on them while she did other things, so I did. I noticed for some reason they would keep running towards the edge of the roof, specifically a gap of about 2ft which I then blocked with a piece of wood. I was sure they wouldn't get past it because they were tiny and the thing was wide. Anyway, after a while I got bored and went back to my room. But when I went back to see how the turtles were doing, I couldn't find them. The roof is surrounded by walls and there weren't any places where they could hide, so the only possible answer was that they somehow managed to climb the piece of wood I left and fell off the roof (it's a fall of about two meters). I then started to look for them downstairs where I thought they could have ended up, and not after too long I could find one of them, unharmed. My family and I spent the rest of that day and half of the next day looking for the other one, all over the house. I can assure you we searched thoroughly, even moving furniture and other objects, but we never found it.\n\nAbout one year later, my mom was casually cleaning the kitchen when she turned around and suddenly, there it was. A small, dried off, mummified turtle, lying on the middle of the floor. To this day we haven't found an explanation to how it got there after a year of being lost and after we looked for it so throughly (it would be more logical to have found it on a corner, hidden behind something heavy, etc. rather than the middle of the kitchen floor).\n\nI don't know if this counts as a glitch in the matrix of not, either way neither me or my family are able to explain what happened. Not to mention I've never stopped feeling extremely guilty for having left the turtles unwatched that day (subestimating their climbing skills, I guess). Whatever happened to the turtle, it surely starved to death. The other one is still alive and grew up alone, when it shouldn't have. I still feel terrible.\n\nTL;DR: Pair of turtles fell from a roof, looked for them like crazy, found one, the other one showed up dead a year later",

        "text": "I'll likely never forget this, but it happened several years ago (maybe 3-4).\n\nOne night I was dreaming that I was in my room. However the dream was extremely lucid and I was feeling pretty vividly involved in the action. \n\nAt some point in the dream I decided to lay down in my bed, to the left side, on my back. \n\nBefore I lay half way down, the scene around me started to get fuzzy. My body felt like it was turning into a trembling blob. The scene seemed to get sucked out of my head through a vacuum and vanish into nothingness as I wake up into a much heavier, sensuous body. \n \nI woke up in the exact same place and position i layed down at in the dream. It was like going through some type of portal. I didn't even know I was dreaming until the dream started to collapse \n\nI've always been one to get sleep paralysis and have lucid dreams. In the past I used weed to sleep and it had the side effect of suppressing my dreaming. However, after 5-7 days of detoxing my dreams come back with incredible intensity, vividness, and bizarre symbolism and scenes. I've seen some seriously weird shit in my time floating through the alternate realities inside my head. I've been 100% aware of the fact that I am inside a dream. I've had lucid nightmares, having to actively think about being inside your own head. Looking at bizarre places and images and knowing that your eyes are seeing something completely and utterly inside of your sleeping mind, locked away from the external world. It's a really fucking creepy and frightening experience but luckily when you start going down that path inside the dream it starts to become unstable and you wake up. Usually startled lol. \n\nBut this one had a unique quality to it. It was this instantaneous, smooth transition from laying down in the dream to waking up in \"real\" life. It was like phasing through one reality to another and it is something I will always remember. \n\nNeedless to say, kinda spooky little hint of how misleading appearances can be in this universe of consciousness ",

This isnt the first time i have heard her when she wasnt even home. \nI also sometimes hear my husband say my name and he is not home. Just today i was in the bathroom and I heard my husband come upstairs and playfully growl \"grrrr\" to my baby, I came out to say hi and wasnt there. I yelled his name down the stairs and my daughter hollered up that he left.\nLast thing was the other night i was checking on my kids and the keyboard downstairs played 2 keys in different tones.

There's no way it bounced by my face and I didn't see it. Also, when I got back in bed, there were 3 other starburst on my bed. They were behind my back. When I leaned down to get the one I threw, there was one beside it. I turn around, only 2 starburst on the bed. I threw another one, heard it bounce on 2 walls in the corner and land to my left. I SAW it land. Get up to grab it, gone. Look all around, nowhere. Look behind my TV that's DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME, its behind it. I threw it at the same wall the TV is in front of, and it hit the corner, hit the wall next to that, and landed to my left. It's physically impossible that it bounced there.

I sighed and picked them all back up and reclipped them together again. Got in my car and went about my day as normal. Now, I get back home after work. As I'm walking down my driveway towards my house, something shiny catches my eye from the floor. I look down, and it's my keychain clip. The exact one my keys are currently on, in the exact spot I dropped my keys earlier that morning. I even brought my keys out of my bag to make sure I had the clip on the keychain. I compared them. Exact same clip, same size, same color, even same amount of wear and tear. The way the clip doesn't totally close all the way, same.  Nobody else walks down my driveway to go around throwing keychain clips down. I thought about taking a picture or something, but I was just tired and really wasn't too concerned. Went out the next morning and it was no longer there. Just thought about it today after looking at this sub. Still no explanation for it. ",

Since collars are cheaper at Walmart, we decided to get it there. But to get his neck measurements we had a piece of thread we wrapped around his neck and cut the string where it met, to be able to see how big of a collar we would need. At the end of the trip, I threw the string away in a trash can outside of Walmart. I saw the string go INSIDE the trash. Well today, I was doing some homework as I'm doing college classes online and I picked up my pen and there it was. The exact string I had thrown away at Walmart. I don't have anymore of the string we used. So there is no possible way that it's just a different piece of string. ",

I came across the account of this girl who had the exact same name as me. She had a different last name and went to another school in my city, she was the same age and from the looks of it she had moved schools. This one guy I used to know followed her. I looked at her posts and thought she looked very much like me. Then I looked again and thought \"is that what I really look like?\". I got insanely freaked out and kept comparing my face to hers and wondering if people saw me as I saw her because I thought we looked so similar except her hair was blonde and at the time mine was dark brown, and I found it even creepier that we shared the same name. I got way too scared and exited off her page and never looked at it again. Yesterday I was curious as to what may have happened to her. I've searched and searched and looked through all the old accounts of the guy I knew that followed her but I can't find her anywhere. It's like she never existed. I swear she had my same exact face, and lots of pictures of her and other people at school, but no matter how much I look for her account I can't find her. Has anyone else had experiences like this??",

        "text": "Back in 2011 I had this intense dream I was telling someone that their father was sick and going to die. I didn’t think about this again until 2014 when I had a dream about a friend’s father. I’d never been to my friend’s (we'll call him Tyler; who I met in 2012) house or met his family. He rarely even mentioned them.\n\n In the dream I was at Tyler’s house in his living room. Tyler and his mom were in the kitchen making dinner and talking. They didn’t know I was there. His dad was lying on the couch looking really sick, and I was sitting on the edge looking down at him. I got the feeling I was almost like a ghost, like Tyler’s dad was the only one who could see me. Maybe the only one who was *supposed* to see me? It felt like I was there on a mission, like I was meant to see his dad lying there on the couch. He looked at me with a serious expression and told me something telepathically (I don’t remember what it was) and then I woke up. I figured Tyler might think I was weird so I never told him about the dream, but a few months later he tells me his dad got really sick suddenly, had a heart attack and is now recovering at home on the couch. Idk if the 2011 dream and the 2014 one were related but it creeped me out at the time.\n\nAlso in 2014 I got a phone call. It was a guy offering my roommate a job she’d applied for. She hadn’t mentioned this to me. Since the call wasn’t for me I asked if I could take a message. Right before the employer told me their name I saw ‘KHRIS’ in my head like a flash and wrote it down on paper. A few seconds later lo and behold their name was indeed Khris, spelled that exact way.\n\nThe same week I had the phone call, I had some kind of vision about my neighbor. She’d been staying at her boyfriend’s house for a few months, never said when she’d be back (she also worked freelance, so her schedule was often unpredictable). I was about to leave my house to go collect a friend from work when I saw my neighbor in my head. It was around 5PM and she was standing on her driveway getting something out of the back of her car.\n\n It happened so fast that I thought nothing of it until me and my friend were almost back at my house. As we came round the corner I saw my neighbor for real standing on her driveway getting something out of the back of her car, wearing the same outfit I’d seen her wearing in my head. When I looked at my phone it was almost 5 o’clock. \n\nDoes this kind of stuff happen to anyone else, and can it be called a glitch? A lot of these dreams/visions all happened in the same month too (Aug 2014), could there some reason for that? I have a dozen more stories like these. Most are about mundane stuff, like I’ll dream my mom buys something unusual at the store and a few days later she’ll call me up and it turns out she really bought it. Some others though have been creepy, like dreaming specific details about future deaths of friends &amp; family that right now are still alive. Kinda hoping those ones don’t come true. \n",

        "text": "This happened over 6 months ago but I only just found this subreddit and I thought it would be the perfect place to tell this story.\n\nI have a dog, Rook, who is a total drama queen. He is scared of his own shadow, and the slightest unfamiliar noise or movement freaks him out. He either cowers and cries or barks his head off at anything that scares him. He is also a big dog, so it's quite funny when he gets frightened of little things.\n\nThis glitch happened after I had just gotten into bed. Rook was in the kitchen in his bed like always, and I was upstairs in my room with is exactly above the kitchen. I was just falling asleep when Rook began to bark manically. At this time of night, about 11pm, this barking meant one thing: A cat was sitting on the wall just outside the kitchen window and Rook could see it. Like everything else, he was petrified of cats so I have to go comfort him before he stops barking and goes back to sleep.\n\nI get up and don't bother turning on my lamp because I know where I'm going. Similarly, I don't turn the hall light on either. This was the beginning of the glitch. As I turned left from my room, in total darkness, and headed for the stairs this light began to get brighter and brighter. I call it a light, because I don't know what else to call it, but it was like a white static you see on old televisions, and it slowly got more and more bright as I got down the stairs. By the time I was in the hallway downstairs, I was surrounded by bright static. I could see *everything* perfectly, which was impossible because it was almost midnight, there were no lights on and no natural/streetlamp light coming from outside because there are no windows in the hallway.\n\nFor some reason this isn't freaking me out. Rook is still barking and I'm like on autopilot and just walking to the kitchen thinking vaguely to myself \"This is a big odd isn't it.\" I could see ever little detail of the hallway; the indents on the wooden doors of each room, the parts of the carpet that was flattened with heavy traffic. The mirrors however were totally dark. Couldn't see a thing in them, not even myself. \n\nI go into the kitchen and think 'well I can see fine with this static stuff' so I don't turn on the lights. I see Rook there is all his statically goodness and tell him it's ok, go back to bed, I'm here blah blah. He got back in bed and curled up nice and I left the kitchen. Still, static everywhere I went right back upstairs and back into bed. I fell asleep about 5 minutes later.\n\nI have no explanation for this. I'm not even sure it's a 'glitch' but I thought maybe some one else has experienced this. If it was a dream, it was the most vivid, intensely real dream I've ever had, ever.",

I was on holiday in Salou in Spain with my parents and I always loved toy cars, so I brought some of my favourites with me, and every day my Dad and I would go back up to the hotel room at around 4pm while my Mum stayed down by the pool sunbathing. My dad would have a beer or whatever on the balcony and I would play with my cars on the bed. There was this one day when I placed all my toy cars on the bed and my Dad and I went to the shop which was around 5 mins away. When we came back from the room, the cars where no longer on my bed but instead packed away in my suitcase. My Dad did not move them, my Mum was still down by the pool, and the room cleaners definitely hadn't been in the room. All these years later this is definitely one of the most confusing things that has ever happened to me.",

        "text": "     Recently, I've been heavily looking into the Mandela effect, quantum immortality, and glitches in the matrix. This stuff is really interesting to me, and I can't seem to get enough of it,  so I thought I'd turn to Reddit to see if I could get some help on some research. There are thousands of posts and videos on the internet of people that have experienced glitches in the matrix. I'm hoping, that with enough people, we can notice some common occurrences in these stories, and maybe with enough information, we could try to initiate our own glitch. \n\n     One common thing that I've noticed, in every video, is that the \"victims\" always return to their \"original\" reality. (This makes sense, otherwise they wouldn't be here to tell the story). If we can get enough details on these occurrences, I'm sure that we will begin to notice patterns, which can then be used to piece together what causes these glitches. This is, of course, assuming that these stories are true, which I believe that there are a good number of them, that are true. I do, however, also believe that a good amount of these stories are exaggerated or completely fabricated.\n\n     Feel free to PM me, or comment your thoughts, or any patterns that you may have noticed. This is very serious. I am interested in this stuff to the point where I want to begin to seriously research the idea that we live in a multiverse/ computer simulated reality. Any stupid or mean comments will be ignored, so if you don't believe in this or don't want to comment anything constructive, find another thread to troll.",

Each day I wake up real early I always make a comment to myself about it because I never do it. So I have been thinking it's weird. But it seems as tho time just flies by from 6-11. I don't lay back down or anything I usually tend to the dog and make breakfast. But today I got up a 6:22am. Checked my tv and phone for the time, both agreed on 6:22am. I plugged my phone in to the charger and then went and cooked an egg. As soon as my egg was done I walk back in and check my phone. It was 10:35am. Now no one is going to convince me I was standing over the stove cooking an egg for 4hrs. I'm not sure what is going on but I believe this has been happening every day on vacation.  ",

Well, once, in Mexico though I was walking from a small store back to mi grandmas house. Literally two houses down, the middle lot is empty. Then our house than the house that's empty and then the road curves into a hill so it's dark right after that empty house. We live in the mountains/hills of Guerrero. National road is right in front of us, not lit by lights except the light informs of the store. In front of that empty house right before the curve I saw two lights, what looked like a dog or animal. Couldn't see a body since it's dark, weird. Just went into the house And thought nothing more about it. Weird, it didn't blink but thy did move. \n\nAnywho, to the glitch. \n\nSo they lights went out on our block and it's hot so I decided to take a cold shower. Naturally I tried to turn on the lights and of course nothing. I just said \" Wow Pm_nudesldies, really. Haha\" and went to shower. \nI'm showering and I start daydreaming will I'm washing up. I'm dreaming about hooping, I just watched some Above the Rim videos on YouTube. I'm hooping in the local park, I get into some type of fight with someone. I start imagining how the fight would go, I'm keeping it real and I imagine in about to get my ass beat lol. We square up and i keep my hands down, I get popped In the eye. At this point I'm shampooing my hair, it's long so I was rinsing for a bit.\nAs soon as I get popped in the daydream simultaneously I imagine I get \"Knocked the a Fuck out!\" (Smokey voice from Friday lol\") \n\nAs I get ko'd I quickly imagine me going into a black out, never been in a fight, and every thing goes black as I'm dreaming. As soon as that happens I hear a Click and I get startled. I open my eyes and the lights are on, my mom has those lights where it's three on side of the mirror so it really hits you. I looked right into them and I was blinded. \nCaught me off guard, took me a second to get back to my senses. \n\nHuge coincidence I know, but I immediately thought of this sub and didn't know where else I could put this. \n\nIf you read this thank you. Sorry for going all over the place, I wrote this on the quicks. We just order pizza so I'm hype. Lol. Have a good day ladies and gents ✌🏾✌🏾👌🏾👌🏾",

So days that are not Friday or Saturday are pretty much dead. \n\nSo I'm standing around as normal doing nothing because I have an 8 hour shift to kill in a small town on a finals week. A man walked in, imagine my excitement! Someone who's hopefully going to tip me giving me a whole 10 dollars in the time I've been here today. \n\nI sit him down, get his menu, a soda and walk into the back to make sure I have enough eggs in the fridge since my chef is taking his normal nap in his car. I walk back out and the guys gone, \n\nI assumed he went to the bathroom so I waited. An hour rolls by, I was worried. Did he die in the toilet? I decided to peak into the restroom. No one, I went to the single men's stall and it was empty. I was a little surprised but figured he decided to leave. \n\nI was a little sad since I really had nothing to do and did all my side work, I start cleaning his table when I hear the door Chim. I scramble up to the door, put on my big ol fake smile and went to talk to whoever wanted pancakes at like 9 pm only for it to be the same dude. \n\nI was pretty confused but sat him down at the same spot, got him the same soda and before he ordered I asked him why he left out of sheer mind numbing curiosity! \nHe looks at me funny and goes \"I just drove into town\" or something along those lines. I figured he was just embarrassed about leaving, \n\nMaybe his card declined or whatever. So I took his order, \n\nNow last time I talked to him I told him my name, Maeson, before getting his drink and thus time I told him after taking his order. To which he replied to the same way he replied to me the first time.\n\"Mae? Feminine name for a guy!\" \nI felt like someone just tossed me through a Time Warp, I kinda laughed like I did last time and said \"Yeah it's short for Maeson.\" Before stumbling into the back to make his food. \n\nThis isn't the first time something weird has happened at this small pancake place. I've experienced paranormal bullshit, glitches and met some weird people here. My theory is that some places are able to move in an out of certain universal timelines causing an attraction of glitches or spooky things. My co-workers also have experienced some weird stuff I might throw up onto Reddit at some point. \n\nAnyways, this guy made a mess fit for two but I wanted to take ten minutes to type this up and see if anyone had any thoughts. Maybe he did run out and was playing dumb, maybe I'm insane, maybe I can see the future. \n\nI don't know, all I know is that I hate working here sometimes.",
