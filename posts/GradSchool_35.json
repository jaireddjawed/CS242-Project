        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI checked the stipend for both my top schools with the one in LA being #1. I was wondering how do you guys live on $34k yearly. As far as I’m aware, you also get taxed on that. These are some questions I had:\n\nWhat’s rent like? Is it possible for you to live without a roommate or at most only 1 roommate? \n\nHow much do you pay for car insurance? I’ve never had a car before or a license so I guess this is going to be expensive for me. \n\nDo you have any disposable income at all for a social life/getting food to go/buying coffee every once in a while? \n\nDo you have enough left over to pay off debt/credit card bills? \n\nAre there any sidegigs you do? I’m an international student so I don’t think I can really do anything. But I was thinking maybe try hard to secure tech internships in the summer? Do those pay well? My goal is academia but I figured you gotta do what you gotta do. \n\nI haven’t received any offers yet but I did have promising interviews where the advisor told me they’re on board but that I’ll be interviewing with other people too before anything gets finalized. So I’m just trying to see how realistic these schools would be for someone who has no safety net and comes from a low socioeconomic background.",

I've applied to a couple grad programs (mainly PhD programs in quantum physics) this cycle. However, I'm currently being screwed over by a lot of different factors (family emergency, tough courses, terrible teammates) this semester, and I might end the semester failing one of my classes and getting a C in another. Both of these classes are unrelated to my desired field of study, but are related to my undergrad major. \n\nHowever, I can potentially retake the requirements that these classes satisfy and still graduate on time. The worst case scenario is that I get a C in one and a F in the other, but it's slightly more likely that I'll end up with a C and a D. Does this put me at risk of getting any grad school offers rescinded once the programs see my updated transcript?",

Her area of focus would be useful for mine, but I am a bit concerned about the amount if harsh criticism that is in my future if I choose her for my committee. I got an A- in the course overall. Idk.

I’m about to go into my first full semester of dissertation writing after passing exams and I’m wondering if I take a health leave or keep going? Started smoking weed occasionally back home but since moving here it’s become an l day every day situation. Which has been fine enough to get through, but I know the diss would be better if I was sober. But I have started dabbling in harder stuff and know it’s a slippery slope. The obvious answer is to take a leave of absence but I’d lose my income, visa, and health insurance, and would have to move back home to another country and in with my parents which isn’t ideal for healing. I’d love to stick with my current care team and add some outpatient recovery services but again, doesn’t seem to be an option if I take a leave. Anyone been in anything similar? Or advice for anyone dealing with addiction?",

        "text": "Today is the day I officially graduate from my Master of Public Health program. This is a momentous day, marking the end of a long journey filled with uncertainty and numerous setbacks. Today is the day that I can finally say, I am done with college! \n\nThe path I took to get to this day has been long and difficult. This day marks the end to a 13-year journey of struggle marked by self-discovery, life-threatening medical issues, five changes in declared majors, an early career change, learning to adjust to a new normal of disabled living and learning, moving across the country twice, starting a family with a NICU baby, a deep depression, and navigating a pandemic. I’m sure there were more hurdles, but these were some of the most salient.\n\nThere are only three people in my life who truly understand the gravity of the hurdles I faced during this time period. And maybe just one other person, my spouse, who can almost fully appreciate the importance of this day. \n\nI am 31, turning 32 next month. Today I will graduate from my MPH program. I graduated with my BSPH when I was 29. I entered a deep depression when I was 26, after the passing of my aunt Diane in the same year. Also in the same year, I had a second surgery to remove an angioma from my brainstem, which subsequently left me with permanent neurological damage impacting my ability to see, feel, eat, talk, hear, and ambulate.  When I was 25, I was majoring in Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience at an R1 University. At age 24, I married my spouse and left the workforce to finish my higher education. At age 22, I was living in Los Angeles working in Hollywood on live television shows. At age 21, I completed a technical certificate in Audio Engineering and Live Sound Reinforcement. At age 20, I underwent my first surgery to remove a portion of the angioma in my brainstem. At age 19, I was accepted into Columbia College in Chicago to begin my undergrad in Clothing Design and Merchandising. This pursuit was ended abruptly with my first brain surgery the next Spring, less than 4 months before I was scheduled to move to Chicago. When I was 18, I was forced to begin college coursework at Lansing Community College, before I was ready to enter higher education. I failed my classes due to a variety of reasons, one of the most important being my lack of a driver’s license and inability to reliably travel 45 minutes from my home to campus when needed for coursework and exams. \n\nThe nuance of these setbacks is lost in this summary, but the details should not detract from the joy I feel on this day of achievement while I reflect on my accomplishments despite the hurdles I have faced. \n\nIt is simply amazing what someone can accomplish when they feel supported and encouraged to pursue their interests and work towards their goals. \n\nFor those who are struggling, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Your accomplishments matter, and you matter.",

Everyone speaks German, and while plenty of people there do know English as a second language, I don't want to impose by asking people to repeat themselves in English constantly. Seems very rude. The program starts in about 9 months and I'm still studying for my undergrad, so I don't have time to develop complete fluency, but I'd at least like to understand people speaking German in casual conversation. What level of proficiency would be most appropriate for this? Are there ways I can learn enough German without spending too much money or dedicating weeks of exclusive study to it? I still have lots of uni work to do and I have to arrange for moving to Austria and the paperwork for that is a full time job all on its own.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.

Im pursuing a MSc in CPE and haven't made much progress on my thesis/research.\n\nAt the moment, the preliminary investigation of my thesis/research is done. I discovered some unexpected results and have to go back to the drawing board (been on this for 6 weeks and haven't made progress until recently -- hoping for the best). After I fix this I can work on the last part of my thesis and then I can start collecting tons of data to make conclusions off of etc.\n\nI have only written about 6 pgs of my thesis (I know this is awful). For anyone that was in my shoes what was your timeline like? Did you already have the first draft of your thesis completed before your final semester began? I can't do this since I haven't completed my investigation due to the  unexpected results I discovered. \n\nI have set the entire break dedicated to my research. So setting deadlines for myself would be extremely helpful! Also, the chair of my committee sent me an email saying that he was concerned about the progress I was making recently :(  Some side notes: I have epilepsy, ADHD, and Depression. Though, I do try to go the gym, I skate, and journal every night.",

        "text": "I'm not sure what to do about a failing grade I received and wanted to see if anyone has had a similar experience. I had a class that was all prerecorded lectures and tests. After a couple of tests, I realized that if I didn't change what I was doing I wouldn't pass the class. I'd been doing the work, but the tests were just insanely difficult. The professor had issues with the way he administered tests as well, things beyond just me, including forcing us to answer complex math problems without a pencil and paper and no calculator, or just having answer choices that were different from his lectures. I reached out to my professor asking for help/advice. Guy tells me not to worry - the tests were deliberately designed to be difficult, and the final project was the important thing. He looked at my grades and said to keep doing what I was doing and turn in a good final project. He said he weighs the final project more than he let on in the syllabus, and if I did well it would bump me into higher grades.\n\nI took his advice and crushed my final project. I put maximum effort and made sure to give him maximum page count for all that was asked and more. I had a 64 in the class from the tests, the project was worth 10 points, but apparently more if what the professor said was true. I turned in my project confident that I would get at least a C, but maybe a B-/C+ if he was generous. Not my best, but I'd take it and move on.\n\nHe never posted the grade to my project. When I finally got my grades, saw he had given me a C-, which is a failing grade. I'm dumbfounded, and I feel a little lost. I reached out to my advisor to confirm if a C- is indeed falling, and I'm trying to approach this with respect for the professor, but I'm just completely at a loss. I've never gotten below a B and I'm just so surprised at how this has all gone down. Feel like I've been lied to, and I don't understand why the professor didn't at least reach out to talk about a failing grade. Especially because it was so close - it's not like I had a D or F, but a C- which is just a couple points away from passing. I'm crushed. Is something like this worth making a stink about, or am I being ridiculous?",

The guy I was going to marry realized he didn't love me anymore and dropped me like a hot potato. I sank into a pretty bad depression, but I am seeing a therapist and starting SSRIs, and am starting to feel back to my normal self. \n\nThe problem is I was pretty unproductive for the past 4-6 weeks. I kept on top of grading and teaching (I am a TA in my PIs undergrad course) and worked a bit on my analyses, but made hardly any progress at all on my thesis chapter. I had wanted to be done a draft by Christmas, but I will not be meeting that deadline. \n\nMy PI is already on holiday out of the country but is still checking their work email. Is it worth it to email them and explain what is going on? I fear their reaction re: missing the deadline either way, but I feel like if I come clean and explain 1. the problem and 2. the steps I am taking to fix it, I'll be a bit better off. But I am worried a breakup isn't \"enough\" of a reason. Death in the family or hospitalization, sure, but boy problems seems a bit tenuous. They know the guy I was dating and the nature of our relationship - basically, they know this wasn't just some guy and could extrapolate probably how devastating this was for me. But I am still not confident that this is the right thing to do. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? My PI is normally a pretty nice person but can overreact about stuff.  Thanks.",

My PI is a great person but I’m his first grad student and in my (and others’) opinion, he can be a bit out of touch with what reasonable expectations for a grad student are. For context, he is an MD/PhD and science is his 24/7 passion. He lives and breathes cellular biology and is irrepresentably enthusiastic about it, which is awesome - but the problem is if I don’t show active and constant enthusiasm at that level, or if I’m unable to produce full-time lab work and essentially full-time paper writing or paper-reviewing work, in addition to random ideas he has every day, he’s clearly disappointed. \n\nI’m just so tired. I already took a monthlong LOA in 2021 because I burnt out trying to write and defend my comprehensive in addition to working full-time hours in lab every week. A month or so ago I was working 60-70 hour weeks and I broke down crying. He wanted to know why I wasn’t able to juggle everything, and I said verbatim “It’s not because I don’t care, but I literally can’t make more hours in the day.” In response, he told me “You need to get better at multi-tasking, because life is never going to be less busy and you need to be able to juggle.” I was sacrificing eating and sleeping and crying all the time and it still wasn’t enough. It crushes me to know I’ll never live up to his expectations even though I’m working as hard as I can on top of living with ADHD and PTSD. How do I divorce my feelings from my work? I feel so ashamed that I can’t be the grad student he wants me to be. He’s even admitted that I’m in really good shape productivity-wise compared to others in my cohort, so I know I’m progressing. It’s just never enough and it hurts so much.",

I have one recommender secured, but need a total of 3 for most applications. Is it too late to reach out to professors to ask about submitting a recommendation letter? For context, it is absolutely my fault for waiting until the last minute to ask- I usually give a 3 week window when asking for letters, but saw many students saying several months notice is better (again, my fault for the underestimate). I would hate to ask if, by this point, my request would be seen as inconsiderate and rude.\n\nThanks for any input offered on my situation.",

No pressure or timeline, just good ol knowledge and a productive break from our major coursework to ideally drive curiousity and prevent burnout.

I don’t want to be back in that mental place where everything felt urgent and hopeless and stuck. I just want to move on with my life where it’s calm and peaceful and I can breather. My field of work now doesn’t care about published academic papers, so I don’t really care if the paper gets published or not.\n\nThis paper is based on my PhD thesis though, so obviously I’m the person most familiar with it. So I do feel a sense of obligation to continue answering these emails. But at the same time, I don’t want to anymore…\n\nWould love to hear your opinions/tips/anything.",

        "text": "Hi y'all… I know a similar question has likely been asked in the past but I'm in a bit of a predicament.\n\nI'm applying to grad schools next month, and all my schools require 3 letters of reference-- I sent out emails to my prospective referees with the request around a week ago. Since I graduated more than 3 years ago, and didn't take some of these people's classes in like… 5 years or so, I was skeptical of whether or not they'd agree to my request.\n\nSurprisingly, the referee I was LEAST confidence in saying yes (because while I did really well in her class, it was in 2017 and I really wasn't sure she'd remember me) ended up responding within an hour to my email agreeing to write me a letter (mind you, I sent the email on Sunday night). As for the other two, it's been complete silence since then.\n\nI sent another follow up email yesterday, and still, nothing. In similar reddit posts I often see commentors advising for people to go to the prof's office hours and ask in-person, but that wouldn't be an option for me on such short notice, because I no longer live in the country I attended university in.\n\nI'm starting to feel really antsy and nervous because if they don't respond, I won't be able to submit my application. I have one professor in mind as a potential back-up whom I will be emailing soon, but I have no back-up plan if BOTH professors don't respond. I'm sure I can scrounge together a letter from a random prof but I don't think it would be very strong.\n\nI'm really stressing out right now. On average, how long does it take for referees to respond to reference requests? I had a pretty strong relationship with both of these professors, and thought that there's no way they'd refuse (my back-up was in case my third professor declined, since I thought she wouldn't remember me). Now I'm feeling really panicked that I won't be able to apply to grad school after all.\n\nAs you can tell, I'm clearly spiralling. Does anyone have any advice for how I can act in a situation like this, if I'm unable to see them in person? At what point do I just give up and realize applying for my Masters just may not be in the cards for me?\n\n\nEDIT: Given that I'm applying for a 2-years Masters in Social Work, an alternative option is to just apply for the Bachelor's in Social Work instead (also a 2 year program), and then do my MSW as 1-year after that. It would take me a year longer than my current plan, but at this point I'm really worried about my options. The BSW only requires 2 letters of reference, and once I'm admitted I can then get more recent, FRESH, reference letters from profs that are actually teaching me in real-time when I apply to my Masters.\n\nThe only thing is that if I decide to go that route, I'm not sure how I'd explain it to the first prof who already agreed to write me the letter. I don't want her to perceive me as fickle and unreliable if I'm changing my plans so last-minute and end up reconsidering the reference letter, but I feel like my options are really limited right now.",

        "text": "I feel so stupid right now. I don't want to make excuses or anything, but I genuinely just got distracted trying to focus on immediate problems and never thought about needing to get started on PhD applications until it was too late. \n\nThis year was terrible. I won't rant about that too much but to give you an idea, my family completely fell apart, my dad attempted suicide and is a shell of his former self ever since, and now I'm completely alone because he's the only family I have left amidst the drama. I also got myself into a lot of debt paying his medical bills and making sure he didn't lose his car or anything while he was in recovery for 2 months, so that hasn't helped.\n\nThen this semester was just a mess. I ended up getting As in all my classes besides one, which I got a C in. Pretty much everyone in the class did poorly because the professor didn't follow the syllabus, completely erased the lab portion so he could use it for lecture and not have to do it online while still expecting us to do the lab work on our own time, and generally was just terrible at explaining things and formatting exams. It was such a stressful course and I feel lucky to have gotten a C, which puts me on thin ice but doesn't ruin my standing since it's my first non A.\n\nBetween depression over how poorly my personal life went this year, the semester being a disorganized mess, and the semester being a disorganized mess making me even more depressed, I just didn't think about these applications. My advisor never mentioned it either. I knew I would need to apply some time this academic year but just didn't know when and was too distracted to ever stop and think about it.\n\nMy plans are completely derailed. I won't be able to even attempt to get into any of the programs I wanted to for an entire year. I'm looking into doing an internship in the meantime or something, but this just sucks.",

I've completely burnt myself out, I literally have not had a break from school since the summer of 2017. Plus, I was working nights 4-5x a week because of how horribly short staffed we were. All in all, my grades were suffering and I was on academic probation. I finally reached out to my advisor and he agreed I needed to take a step back, so now I'm just wrestling with my own self about just taking the break that, if we're completely honest, I probably need.\n\nOn top of that, I've put myself in therapy and have been working with a psychiatrist to treat my depression, anxiety, ADHD, and PTSD that has been caused by working in an emergency room (turns out that's actually not the healthiest place to work aha).\n\nHas anyone else been through this? I feel like a letdown and I'm kind of throwing myself a pity party. What did you do during your LOA if you've ever needed one? Did it help you when you returned? I'm kind of lost right now.",

My BA was in pre-law, which had a ton of writing and research involved. And I took a few creative writing classes while in undergrad. Since I accomplished this so far without a creative writing degree, I always felt like I didn't really need one,\n\nBut now, I'm 33 and I really miss having structure in my life. I also lost a lot of my friends over the years, and I'm craving social interaction. The only downsides would be\n\na) the money/extra debt\n\nb) the potential that I might get bogged down with the school writing assignments on top of work writing assignments. (I feel like my brain might only be able to handle so much at a time.)\n\nAbout 5 years ago, I applied to a Masters in Writing program and got accepted. I just never went, because I chose to keep working instead. But they only hold the acceptance for 5 years, so I would have to re-apply.\n\nDo any of you out there have a Masters in Writing? Has it helped you land better jobs? Or do you feel like it's a waste of money? Should I just join a local writing circle and maybe an online class instead?",
