        "text": "**Warning:** Wall of text. Story takes place over the course of a week.  \n  \n---  \n  \n**Background:**  \nMy husband received an offer at his workplace, but it’s in a different state. We initially turned it down because the offer wasn’t that great, but they came back with a much better counteroffer. After much consideration and a lot of back-and-forth, we decided to take it. So now we’re in the middle of tackling all the moving logistics. In the past, we’ve both done self-moves, but since: (1) this move’s much further than we’ve ever moved before; (2) his company’s reimbursing us for the moving cost; and (3) we don’t know anyone in the area, we decided to hire a moving company. I’ve contacted several moving companies for quotes and this is the story of one of them.  \n  \n---  \n   \n**The Story:**  \nThe sales rep from a moving company called me regarding the move. He was very personable and while he was a bit heavy with the sales pitch, he came off as helpful and we spent almost an hour going through the item list to get an quote. The quote was lower than the ones I have received thus far, but I wasn’t planning on making any decisions until: (1) I’ve spoken to all the moving companies I’ve contacted; (2) research the moving companies; and (3) after discussing it with my husband. I stated that to the sales rep and said that I’ll get back to him the following week.  \n   \n&gt; **“You’re going to wait *that* long to follow up? Let’s follow up tomorrow.”**  \n   \n… No. If he wanted to follow up earlier, I told him that we could follow up on Friday instead (it was Wednesday), but we were not planning to make any final decisions until the following week. He seemed content with that and we scheduled a follow up for Friday.  \n   \nAfter a some Google-fu, as well as checking out the reference links provided in the company’s email, I saw a lot of hits and misses with the company. There were sites with loads of positive reviews, but on sites like BBB, Yelp, and Angie's List, their reviews were less than stellar (with BBB &amp; Angie's List being listed as some of their references in their own email). They also lacked any presence on Consumer Affairs. Now, I've worked with customers before and I understand that negative reviews are more likely to be voiced compared to positive reviews, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and left them on the list of moving companies to consider with my husband. Later that night, we went over the quotes and both agreed that we should look around some more before making a decision.  \n   \nFriday came around and the sales rep called me while I was in the middle of a meeting. I called him back and told him that we haven’t made a decision yet. He asked why and also asked how his quotes compared to the other companies we've contacted. His quote was on the lower end of the quotes received, so he pushed some more, asking if he discounted $100, would we choose his company.  \n  \nThis guy had not been listening at all. I repeated that we were going to make a final decision next week. The decision would be made based on how comfortable we were with a company (after research) and the quote. Price wasn't an issue since it was going to be reimbursed by my husband's company and as long as it wasn't an exorbitant amount. I repeated again that we weren't making a decision yet and I wanted to discuss it with my husband after work.  \n  \n&gt; “**So your husband’s the decision maker? I want to speak to your husband.**”  \n  \nShock. Disbelief. Anger. Is this guy for real?  \n  \nAt that very moment, I stonewalled him. The next five minutes consisted of him asking to speak to my husband, asking to give him my husband's number - to give my husband his number, and asking to speak over the weekend. Sorry, no. My husband's a busy man. He'll hear back from us once we make a decision the following week.  \n  \nWe made a decision the following Monday and went with a reputable company with great feedback, reasonable prices, and it was also a company that our family have seen around. On Tuesday, I sent out emails informing all the other moving companies that we've made a decision and have chosen to go with another company, thanking them for their time and patience, and wishing them the best. As for the rude sales rep, I thanked him for his insight during the entire process. I was taking the high road and leaving it on a courteous note.  \n  \nHe emailed back asking for our deciding factor.  \n  \nI responded and stated that we didn't choose their company due to their less than stellar reviews, lack of presence on Consumer Affairs, and input from family and friends. I didn't even mention his attitude from the phone call. I kept the email as professional as possible.  \n  \nThis was his response: His company doesn't advertise on Angie's List (despite it being listed as a reference on this company's email) and best of all:\n  \n&gt; **\"I tried to be as detailed as possible with you but if you want to go with the company that pays for smoke and mirrors good luck. I tried my best to be honest and transparent with you, but obviously it was your husband I needed to speak with. I wish you the best of luck and if your ideas change i'll still be here to help.\"**  \n  \nWow. Just wow. I emailed back tearing him a new one, first stating that Angie's List **is** listed as one of his company's references, questioned the \"10+ sites\" he kept referencing vaguely and their reviews, before going on to explain how his email and recent correspondence was completely unprofessional and rude. I repeated *once again* that it was a decision my husband and I were making **together**.  \n  \nHis response was to ignore most of my email and just focused on on denying Angie's List being a reference, so as a final \"fuck you,\" I forwarded his own damn company email (from his own email address) to him and told him to review it.  \n  \nHis final response?  \n  \nSuddenly, he was really thankful for my feedback, apologized if he \"said anything to [me] wrong,\" and wished me all the best.  \n  \nWho wants to bet that they'll be taking Angie's List (and possibly BBB) off their company email?  \n  \n---  \n  \nTotally dodged a bomb with that one. If that is the attitude and response that I'm getting for before we even signed a contract, just imagine what it would've been like if my husband and I had chosen them, especially when they have all our possessions. Obviously, I have no say in anything and my opinion doesn't count since my husband's \"*the* decision maker.\" /s  \n  \nAs for the other moving companies we contacted? They were all professional and courteous and none had a problem when I told them we went with someone else.",

I was moving house so I called up my internet provider to set up the moving process... they can't get it set up for the exact day we move but a few days after. No problem they confirm that I'm moving from address abc to address xyz. \n\nThe date the internet is supposed to transfer comes. Someone is supposed to come out to set it up but no one shows and we have no access to said internet.  Give customer service a call and they say they didn't actually have to send anyone out and it should be working but sometimes it can take 24 hours.  I have a sinking feeling and confirm that it has been moved from address abc to xyz, whoever I'm speaking to says yes give it 24 hours.\n\nStill no internet next day call up again they say that it should be working.  I tell them that it clearly isn't, they check their file and confirm that everything was processed and it should be working at abc.  I'm pretty pissed off at this point because they've somehow managed to mix up the addresses even after I asked to make sure that they hadn't mixed up the addresses.\n\nPerson I'm talking to fixes everything in the system but they won't be able to send anyone out for another 3 weeks to set it up. They did give me 4 months free but needless to say I won't be staying with them once my contract ends. ",

I didn't have enough in my card to get money at the ATM.\n\n\nI went and bought some vegetables and went to the register. The person serving already seemed to be... dissatisfied with the older couple in front of me. I worked in a supermarket for many years, so I sort of sided with the cashier as people can be dumb.\n\n\nHmmm.\n\n\nThen it got to my turn, and my vegies rung up as something like $1.20. The cashier asked if I wanted cash out. I replied that I wanted the change of $10. I think I was pleasant as I was a cashier for a long time. \n\n\nShe replied that she couldn't do coins, she could only do $8 or $9.\n\n\nI replied, does $8 or $9 not use coins? A genuine question. I am quite pregnant and I am sure that my country could phase out $1 and $2 coins without me realising.\n\n\nShe replied that she could only do $8 or $9.\n\n\nI said it was OK, and I probably said to chill out in a overly calm \"calm your farm\" tone because she was getting a bit worked up over a non-issue. Had she said, I can only give you whole dollars, I would not have cared, but she specifically said coins and what she said didn't make sense.\n\n\nI ended up taking $8 and funnily enough, my cash out amount included coins.\n",

        "text": "About 6 or 7 years ago, I went to the North of my previous state on a little vacation with my mom, brother, and his ex-girlfriend. The first city we stayed in didn't have much going on, but was a little famous for it's 50's diner/hot dog joint they had. It was supposedly amazing food and the atmosphere was amazing. So we said, what the heck?\n\nIt was a little late, so we checked to make sure we'd have enough time to sit down, order, eat, and pay without taking up too much time. We got there about 7:25 and this place closed at 9. So we order and the food is taking a while. It didn't matter, we were on a vacation and having fun. Until we start looking around. We notice there is no one in this place and all of the workers are glaring at us. We were a little freaked out but didn't think anything of it. \n\nSo our food finally comes at around 7:50. The waiter walks up and kind of throws the food on the table and walks away without asking us anything else. At this point, we were getting pretty pissed off. We look at the food, and I'm not kidding when I say it was the most sorry excuse for a burger. The description of it said it had all of the fixings on it. And it came out looking like a McDonalds hamburger. It was so awful, my brother and I couldn't finish our food. \n\nAt this point, we were ready to go, but this place was also famous for their ice cream and milkshakes. We decide \"You know what, I'll give them another chance.\" The dude comes up with our check, which we didn't ask for, when we ask to get some milkshakes. When Mr.20IQ says \"uhhhh...to go right?\"\n\nAfter we get our milkshakes and pay, he has one last comment. \"Are you guys almost done? We wanna go home.\" Mind you, it wasn't even 8 at this point, 1 hour til they closed. Now, my mother is not a patient woman. She realizes when she's being treated like shit and doesn't take anyone's crap. She snips back \"Yeah, I guess so. And by the way, tell your manager the reason you're not getting a tip is because you have the social skills of a damp rag.\" (Yes, she got that from the British politician). We got up and never went back.\n\nAlso, this town was fucking weird. They had loud sirens going off at 8:15 for about 15 minutes. It was fucking weird and apparently a weekly occurrence.",

At this point, the cook decided that they're being too loud, turns around and says \"hey, can you guys please be quiet?\". My friend is pretty appalled at this point. A restaurant is supposed to be a social place. So my friend looks at the cook and says \"excuse me?\". The cook, again, tells them to be quiet. My friend starts to get pissed at this point and yells at the cook \"ARE YOU SERIOUS DUDE?\". And so, at this point, my friend and the cook are in a full on, verbal fight. My friend proceeds to walk out to his truck, grab a handful of change, walk back inside, scream \"HERES YOUR FUCKING TIP\", and throw the change at him and leave. A few hours later, he came back and apologized to the cook for what he did and tipped him $20. ",

        "text": "Some background: there's a place near where I live that makes terrific sushi, particularly nigiri ([which looks like this](https://goo.gl/images/9eh9hG)). They opened another restaurant in a neighboring city that is close to where I work, so it's more convenient. The original restaurant is 20 minutes away from my work, while the franchise is about 10 minutes away from work. \n\nFor lunch today, I called in a to go order at a local sushi place that I frequent (if I'm working) for two orders of tuna nigiri which equals four pieces. \n\nI get to the restaurant and pay for my food and come back to work. I meet up with a coworker who got food from somewhere else and we go to the break room and eat. I didn't think anything was wrong when I opened the container and showed my coworker my sushi, but apparently he noticed something unusual right away.\n\nI dunked my sushi piece from the far end of the container in soy sauce and took a bite and started coughing. There was wasabi between the fish and rice already. I did not put that there, I usually leave wasabi alone. Apparently the chef had just handled wasabi before pressing the rice or something because one of the rice forms was speckled with wasabi, like it was 50% bright green. I was pissed, but I didn't think to check my food before I left, so that was on me. I thought about calling and complaining but I didn't in the end, though I should have. My coworker saw my reaction to the unexpected spice and said he saw it but figured I had ordered that way. I said no and that I prefer to just dip it in soy sauce.\n\nI still ate all four pieces, because the wasabi wasn't visible on the sushi pieces except for one. I also ate everything partly because I love tuna and I knew I could handle most of the spice because thankfully wasabi spice dissipates quickly...until I got to the super spicy one that was 50% covered in wasabi. \n\nAfter I ate, I had a mild acid reflux reaction which went away after a minute because I was also drinking dairy but I had indigestion and bloating that persisted. The reflux was sporadic throughout the day because I walked around some. However, I drank a soda near dinner which triggered a worse reaction and I didn't want to eat anything because of the pain. I ate some, but food made the reaction worse.\n\nAfter that, I don't want to go back to that place, even though it's more convenient. I'd rather make the drive to the original restaurant even though its further away. It's unsettling that the chef just put wasabi on the sushi without me knowing or requesting it. If I do go back, I'm definitely opening the container before I leave.\n\nTL;DR: Took a bite of spicy sushi that I didn't ask for and finished all the pieces and had a severe acid reflux reaction. \n\nTL;DR again: I'm a stubborn idiot and a masochist.",

This company is a huge national chain, and I've been getting my oil changed at this chain for many years.

You've never paid that here.\n$S: Yeah, I did. It may have been a special, but I usually paid that whenever I came in here.\n$SM: No, you're just trying to get some free stuff out of us. I've been here for 17 years, we haven't changed our prices in 7 years!\n$S: *produces picture of receipt on phone (took it to confirm an alibi for a jealous gf)* No, I'm not. Here's a picture of the receipt, this is the address.\n$SM: F*ck you, dude. That's fake, and you should be ashamed. It's not like you'd get cheaper service elsewhere.\n$S: ...you're kidding me, right? There's a new shop across the street, advertising a $25 oil change. *points at the sign through the window*\n$SM: That place isn't even open!\n*car pulls out of the garage across the street*\n$S: I'll be taking my keys now, and my business elsewhere.\n$SM: Okay, that'll be $20.\n$S: Excuse me?!\n$SM: I consulted you on the best care for your car! You don't think that's free, do you?!\n$S: You didn't, actually, and I do. Unless you want me to call the general manager, or the police.\n\nAt this point, she threw my keys at me, and even though it cut me across the nose, I was just ready to get out of there. I went to the garage across the street, and found that all the old workers from the other one were there. They quit due to a pay cut (hourly wages were the same, but they cut everyone's hours dramatically) and price hike, and opened their own garage. I got everything I needed for $25 and was happily on my way 30 minutes later. They even gave me access to their neosporin for my scrape!\n\nEdit: Removed $NC, since it wasn't entirely relevant.",

Fortunately the apartment had Verizon so we could transfer our service easily (we had Verizon for the past 3 years at our old house). We have the technician come out to set everything up the day we move in and everything goes well. As he's leaving I check the DVR and notice that it's telling me I need to upgrade to use the DVR. I manage to catch the technician before he leaves and he said that he just needed to reset something and that the DVR functionality would return in a couple hours. I say my thanks and he leaves.\n\nThe next day comes around and still no DVR. *sigh*. So I call Verizon to find out what's going on. I kindly explain to the person that we just moved and activated the service yesterday but our DVR still isn't working. He proceeds to pull up my account and tells me \"Well the reason you don't have DVR is because you're not paying for it.\" The reality was that we've been paying for DVR for the past 3 years and even specifically upgraded our service to get the upgraded DVR package about a year ago. The following conversation took place.\n\n&gt;$Me: What do you mean we're not paying for it? We have the most expensive TV package and have been paying for DVR for the last 3 years.\n\n&gt;$VZ: Well sir, if you've had DVR for the last 3 years, that was a mistake and you were getting it for free\n\n&gt;$Me: So you mean to tell me that you guys have had a mistake in your system for 3 years in your billing process that was never caught? That...\n\n&gt;$VZ: Yes sir that's what I'm saying. You do not pay for DVR\n\n&gt;$Me: That's literally impossible. We upgraded our service a year ago specifically to get the upgraded DVR, which we have used without issue for the last year\n\n&gt;$VZ: I don't know what to tell you sir, but I'm looking at your bill right now and you're not paying for DVR. You're only paying for the TV package\n\n&gt;$Me: Which comes with DVR!\n\n&gt;$VZ: No sir it doesn't.\n\n&gt;$Me: Ok, can I please speak to a manager at this point?\n\n*This is where it gets good*\n\n&gt;$VZ: Why?\n\n&gt;$Me: Because we're not getting anywhere so I want to talk to a manager.\n\n&gt;$VZ: But why do you want to speak to a manager?\n\n&gt;$Me: Because I'm not happy with the service you're providing me and would like to speak to a manager\n\n&gt;$VZ: But why sir?\n\n[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/jZrL8Qq.jpg)\n\n&gt;$Me: I don't know how much more clearly I can say this. I want to speak to a manager because we're just going in circles and you don't know what you're talking about.\n\n&gt;$VZ: Well the reason I ask sir is because I am a manager\n\nAt this point the conversation went downhill and lead to me swearing at someone in customer support for the first time in my life. I'm always very calm with customer service because I work in the field, so I understand a lot of the frustrations.\n\nEventually he told me he'd be able to add DVR to my account for only about $5 more a month. At this point I'm so fed up that I just want DVR so I say sure. He goes away for about 15 minutes to do something and comes back and says \"I was actually able to get the price down to $15 less than what you were paying before.\" I say \"OK thanks!\" before he can change his mind or something.\n\nSure enough, we had DVR later that night after going through some additional activation stuff with another tech. It's pretty obvious that he checked something and saw that we actually did have DVR after telling me for over half an hour that we didn't and that was his way of saving face. That was by far the most frustrating customer service experience of my life!",

My cousin and I slipped out of the hotel rooms one night for a beer at one of the many onsite eateries.  We sat down and a waitress came to our table, took our order, and asked to see our IDs.  We gave them to her and she studied them a little too intently, but I figured since my cousin and I lived in different states from each other (and different from the theme park's state as well), that she probably was just properly evaluating our licenses.  That is until she practically threw them on us and said \"You guys need to get out of here.\"\n\nConcerned, we asked what was up.  She repeated herself and when pressed further, sneeringly said \"We don't serve people with fake IDs.\"  Now we were confused.  We both had valid driver's licenses from our respective states, were both old enough to drink, and we told her so.  She said \"Don't give me that!  Do you think I'm stupid?  His (my cousin's) license says he was born on Feb 29th!\"\n\nSuddenly understanding, I said \"Well yeah.  He was born on leap year.\"  Not having any of our excuses, she said \"If you don't go, I'm going to have to get a manager!\"  To which my cousin replied \"I think you should.\"\n\nManager comes over, \"What's the problem?\"  Waitress responds \"These guys are trying to get beer with a fake ID!\"  Me: \"Nope, only valid IDs here.\"  Waitress tells him to look.  He does and said they looked ok to him.  Waitress responds \"But look at his birthdate!  It says he was born Feb 29th.\"  He looks again and says \"Right.  He was born on leap year.\"  She snaps \"I know what leap year is!\"  and the manager stared blankly at her and said \"I don't think you do.\"\n\nHe turned back to us, handed us our ID (politely), and said \"Someone will be out with your beers in a minute.\"\n\nMy cousin and I almost lost it at the \"I don't think you do\", and we didn't have to pay for our beers that night.",

I was asked a few questions, like name, address, and move-in date.\nIt turned out to be a great interaction and went smoothly and quickly. \n\n2 months down the road, we decided that my SO would be paying the water bill for both of us, as we were splitting the bills up. We agree, and she writes a check to the city water dept, and I take it to the billing center.\n\nWhen I arrived, I attempted to pay the water bill, bringing a copy of our bill with, and her signed check.

Fair enough, and I am glad they did their due diligence.\n\nI left, and called my SO, asking her to come down and pay the bill with me, so we could get on our way.\nShe arrived at the billing center, and then we are both informed that my SO cannot pay the water bill because she is not on the contract. \n\nIts getting to be a pain in the ass at this point, but fine, I'll play the stupid game. I ask, can I add her to the water bill, so in the future she can pay?\n\nThe answer is... No. I cannot add my girlfriends name to our water bill. Even though she has 50% ownership of the house, and every bit of paperwork we have says her name right there with mine, I can't add her because we aren't married. \n\nShe is still going to pay the bill, but, I will have to pay myself, and then be reimbursed by her.

I had two $1 bills. \n\nI went inside and said, \"Hi, can I please get quarters for these bills to use your air machine outside?\"\n\nThe employee had a pretty strong accent and a pretty weak understanding of English but said something that sounded like, \"Buy something,\" while gesturing to his register. It seemed like he couldn't open the register without a transaction which is annoying but fine. I doubt that stops many robbers, but I digress.\n\nI thought he had a bit of an attitude but whatever. I picked up some mints and brought them up to him. Since I only have the two $1's that I need to turn into quarters I bought the mints with my card. I figured a transaction is a transaction and I can finally get on my way. \n\nHe gives me a crazy look like I'm not understanding and I ask, \"Can I exchange these now? Do I need to get cash back?\"\n\nHe leans in really close to me, I lean in also, and he says, \"Are. You. Taking. What. I'm. Said?\" He meant, \"Do you get what I mean,\" or similar, which I honestly didn't. I thought I would be on the road by now. \n\nI couldn't make much sense of that so I just said, \"I'm giving you $2 in bills, for $2 in quarters. Is that OK?\" \n\nHe looks pissed, takes my cash, quickly conducts a transaction for $.01 and the drawer slides open. He gets the quarters on the counter but before giving them to me he shows me the receipt with a total of one penny. He seemed to think I was stealing or doing something very wrong. \n\n\"It  didn't actually cost anything to open the drawer,\" I said. \n\nHe kept repeating his last line so I just ended with, \"Well, I gave you $2 and you gave me $2 so we're good.\" I took the quarters and gave him a thumbs up to let him know this was over and that I really appreciated his great service. \n\nHe gave me a super sarcastic smile, gave me a double thumbs up, and said something about, \"You got precious quarters so you all good, man,\" and kept repeating that new line until I was out of sight. Not even out the door, but he kept giving me a face and talking till I rounded the corner out of sight from the store. Sheesh.\n\nFin.\n\nI go this place two to three times a week to buy junk, I haven't seen him before but he is older than any other person I've seen working there so I think he might be the owner or something. Which sucks because this place is literally one block away from me and I don't want to be banned. \n\nI wasn't trying to rip anyone off, and I know convenience stores aren't banks. I was just trying to give them my money the whole time. Super rude and I hope he's not in next time. \n\nLooking back I should've just thrown him a penny from the give one take one cup. ",

We spent about $110 or so and gave the cashier both gift cards. She drains one and charges the remaining $10 to the second gift card. She gives us back the card with the balance and throws away the empty card.\n\nFast forward to last week, we spend another ~$100 hoping to use up the gift card but lo and behold, it rings up empty at the register. That card hasn't left my wife's wallet since last year so we're pretty sure the cashier from last summer mistakenly threw out the card with our remaining balance on it.\n\nI tried calling the store's customer service and was told to go to the store location and they should be able to look up the transaction and see if another card was used for the remainder and be able to replace it. I went to the store today and was told they don't keep records past 3 months (which seems oddly short since the return policy allows anything up to 1 year without receipt). They basically said they couldn't do anything other than to elevate the situation to their regional customer service manager.\n\nNow I obviously don't have the number of the card with the balance, nor do I have a receipt from last year's transaction. I was just really not expecting this to happen. I'm supposed to hear back from regional within \"7-10 days\" but I'm worried that I'm just going to be told to fuck off since I obviously can't prove that this happened.\n\nI'm wondering if something like this has happened to anyone else here and if you were able to resolve it somehow?

This time I was one.\n\nI woke up yesterday and I could not breath. I'm asthmatic and I have had a long-term treatment. I had no medicine, which never happens, and no prescription left.\nSo I decided to call my doctor, which was in vacation, then a couple of doctors in the area, all busy. It was an emergency, and I was alone this morning, so I decided to go directly to the pharmacy at the end of the street.\n\nWell, it was a bad idea. As I walked in, I faced a lady which was reading a thing behind her counter. Again, I was hardly breathing and feeling really bad. I politly waited for her to finish her reading, then she looked at me.\n\nI simply explained (it was difficult to talk) that I was asthmatic and I needed a Ventoline in emergency. In my country, it's around 3 euros, but on prescription. I explained that I didn't had one and all the story, but that she could check on my vital card (in my country we have social security, and a card that allows you to be reimbursed + to see all the medics you ever bought + all your past prescriptions). Giving inhalers in those emergencies are ok-ish and legal here.\n\n\"I don't accept to serve you something only on prescription. It's the rule\".\n\n\"Seriously please - check on my card, I bought a hundreds of these. It's seriously an emergency.\"\n\n\"Asthma is not serious enough for me to outpass the rules. I won't give you one. Plus, you don't really seem sick, so please leave\".\n\nI was litteraly shocked.\n\nIt was as clear as day that I was in a horrible pain, but she refused to serve. Plainly. She was extremely rude, looking at me like who is this guy? Is he mad?\n\nI tried to explain multiple times but she refused. Again and again. I left in a hurry, without saying bye, as I was feeling really, really bad.\n\nI walked 20 minutes to find another one pharmacy, and the pharmacist didn't even waited - she simply quickly handed me a ventoline, as I wasn't even able to talk, sweating and feeling dizzy. Then I was able to bought one. I thanked her very much, and left.\n\nSeriously people. What the fuck?",

I think they are very popular in Texas. It was 1300 and my friend and I decided to give it a try.   We should have known not to since we were the only ones there, in a very populated part of town, during \"lunch rush\". We come in and seated ourselves near the entrance. Our waitress shows up after 15 minutes and gives me a diet Dr. Pepper, and my friend and unsweet tea (We had not ordered drinks yet.) she leans into out booth, half falling, pulls out a notepad and pen and slurs \"what do you want?\" I order a burger with everything and fries... My friend orders a burger, only cheese. Nothing is written down and the waitress stumbles off to the kitchen. Our booth is now surrounded by cloud that smells like liquor. We changed seats but left our drinks there since we did not order them, and waited for our food. We had fun talking and lost track of the time, it has been 53 minutes and we had not seen our waitress at all. We were in the restaurant alone. We stood up and peered over the counter behind the register, to see into the kitchen. The chef was indeed cooking something, but it was not a burger. It looked like he was reheating a few slices of pizza on the grill. My friend nudged my arm and gestured to the floor right behind the counter. Our waitress was sprawled on her back on the floor, passed out. \nWe checked to see if she was breathing and left. Looking back I should have called an ambulance or rolled her into her side in case she threw up, but I was a very shy and dumb kid. The burger joint closed a few months later. There were no reported deaths at the restaurant, so I hope she was okay. ",

Either pay or leave.\n\nT: Duck! (Walks off angrily)\n\nI step up to pay for some items.\n\nX: I'd like to buy the makeup please. \n\nF: I saw you come in with him. I can't sell it to you.\n\nX: Why not?\n\nF: It's for women, not men.\n\nD: Can we see a manager please?\n\nF: No. You can pay or leave.\n\nX: I want to pay for the makeup.\n\nF: You can't. Your total is Y.YY.\n\nT returns with a manager (M) who begins speaking with F. F keeps avoiding the questions, just saying that she 'can't sell it to him'. M is being very patient, asking her why she can't sell it, and even if it's due to religious or cultural beliefs. F keeps repeating 'I can't sell it to him' but finally bursts out with an answer. \n\nF: My grandmother uses that brand. I don't want some man wearing the same lipstick as her.\n\nThe manager sold my brother the makeup and apologized for the employee. I don't know if she was punished or not, but I just don't get refusing to sell makeup based on the gender of the person. For all she knew, his girlfriend could have sent him to the store to buy it, or he could be getting it for a female family member or friend. And I hate to break it to her, but that brand has been around a good while. By now, some man somewhere has definitely worn it.\n\nNote: My brother swears a LOT, so I replaced the swear with the similar sounding waterfowl.",

        "text": "This just happened today.\n\nI went to the supermarket and was in line with a cart.  There's a woman in front of me -- after this incident I can't call her a lady.  She's finishing her transaction with the cashier, and it seems she's forgotten something.\n\nSo she sees me, and my cart, and saw the product that she had forgotten, in my cart -- ***so she grabbed it out of my cart and put it in front of her.***\n\nThe cashier and I were both appalled at this woman's rudeness, and the conversation went like this.  We'll call the participants $Me, $B for woman, $C for cashier and $M for manager.\n\n&gt; **$Me:** Hey!  You put that back!\n\n&gt; **$B:** I need this.  You can get another one. *(No, I couldn't; there were two other people behind me.)*\n\n&gt; **$Me:** Lady, give me that back now.\n\n&gt; **$C:** Ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to give that back to him.\n\n&gt; **$B:** No.  Continue checking me out.\n\n&gt; **$Me:** I don't believe this.  Can you call a manager? *(To the cashier.)*\n\nThe cashier picked up her phone and called the manager over.  Meanwhile the ... woman ... is still loudly insisting that she be checked out so she can leave.  \n\n&gt; **$M:** What seems to be the problem?\n\n&gt; **$C:** This woman grabbed this item out of this gentleman's cart and she's insisting I check her out.\n\n&gt; **$M:** Ma'am, I'm going to have to insist that you give back the item.\n\n&gt; **$B:** Oh no!  I need this and I don't have time to go get it!  I have places to be!  Check me out and let me get going!\n\n&gt; **$M:** Ma'am, I'm going to have to insist.\n\n&gt; **$B:** No!  You're going to check me out!  *(starts yelling)* ***I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE TREATING ME SO RUDELY!!!***\n\nThis was when my jaw hit the floor.  Wait, *we're* the ones being rude to *her*???\n\n&gt; **$M:** Fine.  *(turns to a bagger)*  Could you run over to Aisle 4 and get this gentleman what he needs?  *(turns to cashier)* Get her out of the store.  *(turns to woman)* After this, ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you do your shopping elsewhere.  You're no longer welcome at our store.\n\n&gt; **$B:** *(still yelling)* ***I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED SO BADLY IN MY LIFE!!  I'm telling all my friends on Facebook NOT TO SHOP HERE AGAIN!!***\n\nBy the time the runner came back with the thing I needed, the woman had been checked out, but she had to wait because the bagger had to go get my item.  So I got checked out while the lady was getting her stuff bagged, with the manager staring daggers at her.  (He gave me the item for free, and they're mailing me a gift card for the inconvenience.  They have this shopper's card program, so yes, they have my address.)\n\nHere's a little revenge story:  Since I didn't have as much as the b... woman did, I got out of there at the same time.  So I followed her to her car, and stood there watching her like a psycho stalker while she put her food in the car.  I even made a note to act like I was taking pictures of her car and her license plate.  Of course, there's not much I could actually have done, but I was so angry with this woman I wanted to make her feel bad for being so rude.  Yeah, I probably shouldn't have done that, but ... seriously, I didn't even have words, how angry I felt.",

There is 2 lanes at the drive thru, it works as a zipper effect to keep the orders straight between the different lanes. \n\nLong story short, impatient driver in the next lane ordered his 2 drinks and pulled in front of me, throwing off the zipper. Didn't think much of it, just that he was a bit impatient, but not a day ruiner. \n\nI pull up to the window to pay and the worker goes \"You had the medium sprite and medium coke right?\" I then tell her \"No my order was roughly 25 dollars with 4 meals\". She then turns around to the other window and has a quick chat with the other associate. Apparently, due to the driver before me and the rush he was in, he had paid for my order and left with his 2 drinks as if all was well. Sadly enough I still had to pay for my own order (capitalism), but the impatient driver also had to pay for my order. Of course they will give him a refund when he goes back to demand it, but the fact that he couldn't wait his turn in line turned out to be a much larger hassle then he expected. \n\nTL;DR Dont cut someone off in the drive thru unless you want to spend 25 dollars on your 2 medium drinks.",

On one hand, I don't like to interfere with parents and their kids.  On the other hand, no one deserves to be yelled at by management in full view of the customer.  That is definitely a closed-door-meeting scenario.  I tell the manager this, she disagrees but apologizes for causing a scene.  And we go our separate ways.

        "text": "I posted this elsewhere, but I found this sub and seems like my story fits here, too. I've literally been getting the runaround on bringing my SO's old (but still nice) phone over to my month-to-month network for over 4 weeks. I've been a loyal customer for about 4 years, I think. Let me chronicle the ways that I've been getting the ol' bullshit spin cycle.\n\n\n- This company's website described that I needed to go to a specific brick and mortar store to get a proper SIM card for the phone. Turns out that store (and maybe all of those stores in general) hasn't carried my carrier's stuff for months. Okay. Time to actually call support.\n\n- After giving the MEID of the device to phone support, they claim that the phone is not compatible with the network (BS like \"some phones are not supported on our network\" and \"you might have a locked phone\"--wrong). They can't re-SKU it. They don't want to send me a SIM card. Ooookay then. After describing how all of these specific phones are unlocked, and that they have a specific FAQ page online about bringing phones including my specific model over from another carrier to their network, I'm told that I should probably be able to get the phone working, but it would probably be best to go to *another* brick and mortar store near me and they will set me up.\n\n- I head over to the specified second store. They tell me \"we don't have SIM cards for your carrier. You need to get back on the line and get them to send you one.\" Now I'm getting pissed.\n\n- Back on the phone. Not yelling but a very flat and stern tone being taken. They try to activate the phone again and are in the middle of telling me it's incompatible while I'm interrupting them telling them they are wrong and need to escalate me to someone who knows what they're talking about. I get handed off from the Indian/Filipino center to a Mexican dude at tech support. I'm ecstatic. I can understand this guy without asking \"what\" every third sentence, and he doesn't call me ma'am anymore (I'm a dude that doesn't sound like a girl). He says that they can send me the SIM card I need for free, but he really thinks that the phone is locked so make sure during the mean time when the SIM card is being shipped to call the original carrier and have them unlock it. He says this program is fairly new and they are still getting the hang of it. No shit. It's a simple 3 in 1 SIM that will arrive in 3-5 business days.\n\n- I immediately call up the old carrier for the phone and of course because they are a premium company, I get right on the line with a pleasant American woman with a southern accent. She confirms that the phone I am holding is unlocked, as are all others of that model because they're all unlocked by law (I knew this but was starting to go insane at this point).\n\n- (4 business days later) SIM card comes in a package. I pop it in and call up support. Support tries to start going from square one and I'm fine with that. Everything should be cool because I'm all set up, right? **Wrong**. Can't activate. Also, the SIM card is incompatible. WHAT?! That's impossible! You guys sent me the card you said I needed. I get escalated to one of the Southeast Asia center's managers after a bunch of waiting on hold. Somehow, the manager says they did something fancy to be able to re-SKU the phone, but yes indeed, the SIM card is wrong. I'm escalated to the Mexican tech support center to get it figured out. \n\n- After explaining everything so far, it is determined that the wrong SIM card was ordered and that I need a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) SIM kit. *Fuuuuuuuck youuuuuuuu guyyyyyyyys*. I need to go to one of the local stores and buy one for $10. **Fuck. You. Guys.** I say that is ridiculous because I went there in the beginning of this epic poem and no dice. He doesn't believe me. He calls the place...\"you're right, but I'm going to call another store near you.\"...\"you're still right. I guess a lot of people in your area are taking advantage of our program.\" Suuuuure. He says they don't have any in their warehouse to send, but I can go to the nearby big box store A or B and they have them, so do that instead. I say I'm sick of this search; this SIM card is not the Holy Grail. Please stop the runaround--I ask is he *sure* that I can get them there? **Yes. For sure**. I get a confirmation number on this interaction for later use if he's lying.\n\n- You know where this is going...store B says they don't have any BYOD SIMs. When I call store A, they say they think they do, but to just come over because the guy that \"knows phones\" is on break and will be back soon. So I drive over, wait an extra 15 minutes just so the guy can bring me over to the phone accessory case and tell me that they haven't had any of my carrier's stuff in months. Cool. I'm incensed. I've never been so pissed at a company in my life.\n\n- Back home, I call up my carrier one more time. I demand immediate escalation but am denied for minutes because of fumbling and incompetence. \"LOOK AT ALL THE NOTES ON MY ACCOUNT AND PLEASE ESCALATE ME.\" They escalate me to proper tech support. I demand to know why the guy in my previous interaction number was allowed to lie to me. The guy says he's sending the new SIM card immediately for me, but is confused about this so-called \"lying\". I tell him that if it's too confusing, then I need to talk to his manager. I'm put on hold and eventually the manager gets on the line.\n\n\n- She is apologetic in a fake way. She sees that I'm getting another SIM card and it is *the wrong one again*. \"The correct one you absolutely need to pay $10 for,\" she says. As soon as I have that SIM, everything in their system says the phone will hook right up to the network. \"We can order the SIM right now, if that's okay.\" I'm livid. I'm loud and kind of rude, but not yelling or swearing or anything that will get me hung up on. I tell her how much of my time they've wasted and demand to know why I was lied to. And no, it's not okay after all this that I'm paying $10 for your damn card! I was willing to do that the first 4 times I tried to buy your crap, but not now. More fake sorry. She says that the previous agents will all get retrained, and the one guy wasn't *really* lying because the stores don't communicate well what they have in stock, and they really didn't have any BYOD SIMs in their warehouse until a couple hours ago. I don't care about what she describes. \"What are you going to do for me to fix this? I'm not paying $10 for your card and you've done nothing to help me when all I wanted to do was BUY YOUR GARBAGE SERVICE. How are you going to compensate me?\" More fake sorry. She'll start a grievance ticket and talk with the back office--ask what they can do for me. Maybe I can get at least a month of free service or whatever?\n\n\n- I can get the $10 taken off my next bill. *Ugh.* I'm mentally shot and exasperated with the whole situation. I acquiesce to this token gesture. Send me the SIM. Reprimand and retrain the support workers (who knows what that really entails, and I don't really care). I'll ditch the service someday, but I let the sunk cost feelings win in order to get some closure on this shitty tale. I'm about to receive my BYOD SIM card in a day or two, and I'm guessing that will finally be it for my saga. At least, I'm praying that it is.\n\n\n**TL:DR** My carrier is the worst.

        "text": "I mistakenly posted this on /r/talesfromretail but I was a customer at the time... so I guess I'll just leave this here instead.\n\nSo, although I have worked a few years in retail this story actually comes from a time I was the customer...\nA couple weeks back I had to go fill a prescription at the pharmacy inside a general health and beauty store here in the UK. I had already spent a tedious wait in another of these stores at a different location (cashiers taking their sweet time, chatting to each other about their weekends casually, when there was a massive queue of customers waiting), only to be told that they didn't have my prescription in stock. I opted to go collect at another store nearby.\n\nWaiting in the queue at this other place, the pharmacists here also seem to be moving slower than usual, but I understand prescriptions take a while to deal with for whatever reason and I wait patiently, smiling encouragingly whenever a pharmacist looks over in the hopes they will see how patient I am being and get to me faster...\n\nAfter a little while, a lady [L] starts browsing the shelves that are in front and to my right and kind of looks at me like I'm in her way. I move slightly so she can get to whatever it is she wants to look at, and her husband [H] comes to stand at the end of the shelves.\n\nI stop paying attention to her, looking away again trying to see if the pharmacists are any further along than before, when this cow just turns around in front of me to face the till like she's been waiting in the queue all along! Fully just takes a shot at queue jumping me.\n\nI'm about to say something to her, thinking, *Did she really just do that?? She saw me waiting here!* when I hear her husband who is still at the end of the shelves watching/waiting for her pipe up,\n\n&gt; H \"Hey, there's a queue there you know?\" (He gestures to me and the others standing around in a usual queue formation of the linear variety...)\n\n&gt; L \"Yes yes of course, I know, I know!\" (She seems irritated and turns around to look me straight in the eyes...)\n\n&gt; L \"Are you in the queue?\"\n\nAt this point I give her a raised eyebrow, like \"Yes?? Of course?\". She accepts this and takes her rightful place at the back of the queue. I am thankful for her huband being a nice guy.\n\nNow, fast forward another 5mins or so and I am finally at the front of this queue (in between the two registers) and the one on my left finally finishes and calls for another customer, and this silly cow AGAIN just steps in front of me and starts talking to the pharmacist!! She is trying to ask the guy about something she just picked off the shelf and is getting deep into conversation so I had to speak up this time.\n\nI say to the pharmacist in the calmest, friendliest, fellow-retail-worker voice I can,\n\n&gt; \"Excuse me, sorry, but that lady was actually behind me in the queue so could you serve me first please?\"\n\nThey both turn around and I get some proper death stares from the two of them!! Like, wtf?? The pharmacist had even looked at me so many times in the queue, he knew I was there first!\n\nThe pharmacist serves me coldly and I still have to wait 15mins more for him to actually dispense my pills to me ): What did I do to deserve this?!",

I pay for my purchase and realize they never offered me the scratch off for the discount so the cashier looks at me with a blank stare and sends me to customer service.\n\nOnce I get to customer service, the rep tells me that the promotion ended on Friday (today is Sunday for future readers), so I bring up the website that says in store or online until Sunday. She refuses to look at it and repeatedly tells me I'm wrong. I refuse to back down and keep asking for my discount to the point where she frustratedly asks if I would like her to call a manager so I tell her to please do so. \n\nShe calls her manager and you could see the look on her face as the manager tells her that I am indeed right and to give me a scratch off to reveal my discount. She pulls out a box of them from under the counter THAT HAS TODAY'S DATE AS THE END DATE ON IT! I point it out to her and she doesn't even look at me and says that they must have extended it. \nIn the end she did let me scratch until I got one that said 30%, refunded the difference  and let me keep the remaining ones that I scratched off and didn't use. \n\nThing is, I work retail. I deal with situations like this all the time. If our website is advertising something for in store, I verify it and give it to the customer because that's good customer service. You don't stand there and refuse to look at something that has the correct information on it. ",

        "text": "LTL, FTP. \n\n\nMy dad and I are at the Fruit Store (or as he called it, \"the store where you wish you could afford things\") because why not. We're browsing around and decide to get the Fruit TV 4 (which is a great upgrade from the 3rd one, for those of you hesitating). \n\n\nAfter waiting patiently (and noticing the amount of kids with grandparents or simply elderly people asking for help- this is after Christmas), an employee is free to help us buy the soon-to-be box of joy. He calls another employee over as he doesn't have the checkout thing with him. \n\n\nBoth employees are visibly helping us out when an elderly man who looks like he just returned from golfing- hat and all- pushes his way between both employees and sets down what my best guess would be an FruitPad 2 right in front of the guy who was scanning the barcode and all of that. He waits for a moment, as if he thinks that merely putting the FruitPad in the presence of the employee will do something. \n\n\nHe then starts talking to the employee who was also just asking a quick question to us. Yes, you read that right. The man obviously was aware of the employee talking to us as he talked louder than the employee. He mentioned something about the home button. \n\n\nThe employee who didn't have the checkout thing was trying to hold it together, half-annoyed and the other half finding the situation funny. \n\n\nThe employee with the checkout phone thing waited for the man to stop talking for a moment then said, \"I'm taking care of these customers at this moment. Please give me just a minute and I'll be happy to look at your problem.\"\n\n\nThe man looks like he had just been insulted to the tenth power. He then continued to talk loudly and started to put the iPad in-between the employee and the register-phone. He told the employee to click the home button as the problem would be obvious. \n\n\nHe then glared at us like we were the cause of every problem in the fabric of space and time. He probably thought so, too, because if there are any two generations baby boomers seem to have a serious hatred against, it would be the iGen and Gen X. And here we are, my dad a Gen X and me an iGen. Both of us knowing more about technology then most of the customers in the store combined. \n\n\nThe poor employee finally clicked the home button in hopes that maybe he could tap the remaining buttons to finish the purchase before the next shenanigan. \n\n\nThe screen turned on as normal. There was, from my perspective, nothing wrong with that button. Maybe he was confused by Touch ID, or the fact that FruitOS 10's unlocking sequence is different than the other versions of fruitOS. \n\n\nThe man looked triumphant. He looked at us like we were dirt. He thought he was going to get to go before us. \n\n\nEmployee manages to finish transaction before anything else could happen. He knew he was going to be tech support. He had that look and we returned it (sympathy for having to deal with users). \n\n\nThey say that elderly man is still looking for answers, trying to make his obsolete-because-technology-advanced fruitPad just like the shiny new ones, not understanding just how different they are.

        "text": "Years ago, we moved from one city to another. We had ISDN and DSL at the old address, and wanted to have the same, with the same settings and options, at the new address. No problem, according to the telco.\n\nWe made an appointment for the technician to install the line in the new place. As I had to drive 50km between the places, I requested the appointment to be after 10:00, which they agreed to. Nonetheless, I stayed in the new place just in case. At 8:00, the doorbell rang. Guess what, the telco technician. I showed him where their connection box was, the cable I had already installed, and the place where the outlet should be installed - everything was prepared, installation took 5 minutes (I could not have done this by myself, as the connection box is sealed).\n\nSo I told the technician to test the line. \"Oh sorry, I have no test equipment here!\". WTF? I got some ISDN test equipment from a box and handed it to him. He tested the line, found some configuration errors and promised to fix them (we had 10 telephone number on that ISDN, with a bunch of different, but standard options).\n\nI asked him to test the DSL, too, but he had no equipment for that, either. How are they doing their job without equipment? Well, my testing equipment was in the old flat, so I could not test it myself. But he told me that this should work, it was set up only a few days ago.\n\nTwo days later, I moved my equipment, lo and behold, no DSL. Called service, DSL came back the next day - It was set up to switch off if the system found no modem for 48h in a row. And it would not have worked the day the technician was there.\n\nA few days later, we got a big letter from the telco: they had taken all the ten number offline, and put them back in again, with about half a page for every number removed and set up. But they totally f-ed this up: While they fixed the one setting on one of the numbers that was wrong, they had reset all the other numbers back to default settings... Three more letters like that, and all options were finally OK.\n\nBut it did not end there. Months later, my wife called: internet was gone. Restarting the router, etc. did not help, so I told my wife to call the telco support. Their reply: \"You don't have DSL at your current address, so it was switched off\". WTF? So what were we paying for? Turned out that they forgot to move the DSL entry from the old address to the new, and forgot to disable DSL at our current address when the previous inhabitant moved out, so according to their database, we still had DSL in another city in a flat we left months ago, but not at our new place. And the DSL we had used was the DSL from the former tenant. OK, they agreed that this was a mistake on their part, but the port was now somehow blocked, and we should just re-apply for a new port, which we would get *in eight to ten weeks*...\n\nLuckily, I was the lech support guy from the company I worked for, and I had a number for our contact person in the commercial customer support at the same telco. She once told me, if I had private trouble with them, I should call her too, and she would sort it out (It makes sense for them not having to deal with a commercial customer who has a private beef with them). I called her and told her of my troubles. She told me she would take care of this. And boy, she did. An hour later (it was already after regular office hours), the telco end user support called, was very, very sorry about the mistake, and would reinstate the DSL the next morning, pronto, and was sorry that they could not do this sooner due to technical limitations!\n\nSince then, the line worked without a problem, and I hope to upgrade to 50 or 100M RSN...",

        "text": "This is going to be long AF but considering this started in 2015 and will end in 2017, it makes sense. The ending is GOLD though.\n\nSo, I used to get my phone/internet from a little company in the UK, let's call them \"ShoutShout\". Around September 2015 I started having serious issues with my broadband, either it would become unbearably slow or completely cut off and not work for extended periods of time.\n\nI contacted them in the same month and told them about the issue. The guy on the phone said he would need to run some tests on their end to check my connection, he did this and agreed with me that there was a fault with my connection.\n\nAnyways, long story short, this happened continuously for a while, the issues persisted and every time I called they would repeat the same stuff which never properly solved the problem instead of sending someone over.\n\nIn November, they gave me compensation for October because the service was so bad. Got half off October discounted off the bill.\n\nThroughout November onwards the issues still persisted, I'm starting to lose my patience more and more. Phone calls with no resolution, passing me round and round trying to frustrate me, even occasions where they dropped the phone on me and one where the guy was just flat out insulting when I was trying to explain the story for the hundredth time etc.\n\nEvery time they would pass me from person to person I would have to explain the entire story right from start again because these people apparently don't take notes or keep records or liaise with each other... \n\nFast forward to January 2016, I finally get them to send someone over to check their connection, this engineer comes and checks the phone connection and says there's no issue... I'm telling the guy I didn't have an issue with the phone line I had an issue with my broadband connection. The guy says he only came to check the line and that they would have to send a broadband engineer. (Deep breaths) \n\nThis guy actually told me, on the low, that they do this kind of thing all the time because sending out a broadband engineer is more expensive since it's not them that maintains the connection and they have to pay the company that actually owns the infrastructure to send the broadband engineer.\n\nAfter this happened the issues still continued but I was pretty much so fed up with dealing with them that I stopped bothering I just used the service as was for a bit, All the while from September through to January I had been promptly paying my bills for garbage service. \n\nNothing happened until March when I got my regular bill with an added £65 charge for the engineer in January.\n\nI called them up immediately and they told me that in instances where they send an engineer and where there is no fault or the fault is caused by the user the cost of the engineer is passed onto the bill payer.\n\nI told them straight that I am not paying shit, furthermore how can you put the blame on me despite the fact that every time I called (which were numerous over months) they themselves acknowledged there was an issue with the connection.\n\nMarch passes, I don't pay, They cut me off in the middle of April leaving me with no internet right before my exams which was a nightmare. I'm shopping around for broadband and ShoutShout calls me, says they will erase the £65 charge if I pay my regular bill for March. I paid so I could get my internet back asap, guy on the phone says the service will be back within 48 hours.\n\n48 hours comes and goes, I call them, guy says service will be back later that day. That day ends. I call them next day, now they say I need to pay the £65 charge to get the service back. I speak to the manager to explain what just happened and he insists I must pay the £65.\n\nAt this point I'm done.\n\nWe're pretty deep into the 2nd half of April and I have exams literally right at the start of May and have no internet at home. I end up shopping around for broadband and the best I could get was a new install in 2 weeks!!! I took it.\n\nAlso note that after they cut me off, lied to steal my money without returning the service they then continued to charge me for May, June, July etc when I had no service from them\n\nThey continued to charge me until It accumulated to around £180 I think, then they added some charge again because they handed the account off to some external agency or something.\n\nAll in all they wanted me to owe them £267 (Charged me for subsequent months w/ no service + £65 engineer fee + termination fee for breaching contract + some fee I forgot what it was for, let's call it BS fee)\n\n----\n\nNow we get to the good part\n\nSkip to August 2016\n\nI decided I'm going to deal with this company so I reported them to Ombudsman Services which is basically a watchdog that oversees companies etc in the UK. You can go to them for complaints and get arbitration. They take my side and ShoutShout's side.\n\nI few months go by Late October/November (I forget). They finally get back with a decision, they found a bit in my favour and a bit in theirs but ultimately the outcome was that I still owed them some figure around £140. \n\nI appealed that decision as I believed the guy handling the case didn't understand properly that after I paid the March bill in April, I should have had my services reconnected as agreed because I would have owed them nothing after clearing the regular March bill and the only reason I hadn't paid was because they refused to reinstate the service unless the bill was paid in full (£65 charge included) and I wasn't about to give them free money (since £65 was meant to be waived) but they lied to make it look like I still owed them.\n\nAnyways, after I clarified this in my appeal they came back in January 2017 pretty much ENTIRELY in my favour.\n\nI'd like to link a screenshot of the conditions for remedy which SS must comply with, they actually ended up owing me money\n\n[ShoutShout must comply](http://i.imgur.com/9r2ys0z.png)\n\nI made sure to demand a letter of apology just to make them eat that humble pie :)",

I get a sense of what he is thinking. *is it worth it to piss these people off and just go ahead?* Before he can decide I just zoom on over to the lane. \n\nM: \"Well I am in a hurry and I am gonna just go ahead, sense I waited.\"\n\nFor whatever reason that works. IC goes to the back all pouty like. \n\nToday I was back in the store checking out at one of the regular registers. The cashier running it is one of the regular sco cashiers and happened to be the one watching it that day with IC. Apparently the employees got a good kick out of it because it is something this guy does regularly when they are busy. He usually argues until he either gets his way or is taken to another register to be checked out right away. He is forever in a hurry I guess.",

        "text": "When I made my drivers license, I went to the nearest optician for an assessment and they had a machine I've never seen before.\n\nThe employee instructed me on how to position my head in front of it but didn't care to explain anything else. So, my head was resting there, my eyes staring into darkness. Then he turned the machine on and I was immediately blinded by the sudden and unexpected bright light. Of course, I blinked.\n\n&gt; He: \"Please don't blink.\"  \n&gt; Me (internally): \"Then use *words* to ducking warn me!\"\n\nA picture of a balloon appeared and I started focussing on it, like (I assumed) I was supposed to. 10 seconds later, nothing happened, I (naturally) felt a strain on my eyes and blinked.\n\n&gt; He: \"Again, please don't blink.\"  \n&gt; Me: releases an annoyed sigh\n\nWithin a fraction of a second the picture became unsharp, then sharp, then unsharp again and confusion set in. It felt like the object travelled hundreds of meters closer and further away again, all in a fraction of a second.\n\n&gt; He: \"Thanks, we're done.\"  \n&gt; Me (internally): \"What the heck just happened?\"\n\nI stand up and he hands me a piece of paper.\n\n&gt; He: \"This is your receipt for the agency. If you like to, we can schedule an appointment right now.\"  \n&gt; Me: \"An appointment for what?\"\n\nI looked down on the receipt and felt my jaw dropping on the floor: 2.0 dpt on the left, 1.5 dpt on the right eye.\n\n&gt; He: \"I'm sorry, but you will need glasses in order to drive a car.\"  \n&gt; Me: \"There must be an error. I know for a fact, my eyesight is very good. I was confused by the machine. Now that I know what it does, may I please repeat the test?\"\n\nThis wouldn't have been a problem. The test took less than a minute and there were only a few other customers in the store who were already being served. But he didn't let me. I was pissed. I don't argue when I'm pissed.\n\n&gt; Me: \"Are you an optometrist?\"  \n&gt; He: \"No, I'm not.\"  \n&gt; Me: \"I'd like to talk to the optometrist, please.\"  \n&gt; He: \"He won't be here for the rest of the week. Do you like to schedule an appointment?\"\n\nWhere I live, stores like these are legally required to have a professional available at all times.\n\n&gt; Me: \"Thanks, but that's not going to happen. I'd like to pay now.\"\n\nThis guy was polite, I give him that. But he had obviously no idea what he was doing, except for the buttons he had to push.\n\nFeeling defeated and concerned about the \"result\" of the test, I went home and browsed the internet looking for people with similar experiences. The opinions I found were unambiguous:\n\n1. Always demand a professional.\n2. Always demand a [Landolt test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landolt_C).\n\nI threw the receipt into the bin and went to another optician the next day.\n\n&gt; Me: \"Hello, I need an assessment for (driver license agency). Is an optometrist available and do you perform the Landolt test?\"  \n&gt; Desk: \"Hello, yes and yes. Please have a seat, Dr. (optometrist) will be with you in a few minutes.\"  \n&gt; Me (internally): \"Dr.? YEAH!\"\n\nThe Dr. came to me and asked me to follow her. She asked me to sit down in front of the machine.\n\n&gt; Dr.: \"Since you've been asking specifically for this test, I assume you already know how it works?\"  \n&gt; Me: \"Yes, I read about it online after having a quite unpleasant test experience at (competing company).\"  \n&gt; Dr.: \"What was the result and which test did they perform?\"\n\nI told her the result and explained the machine to her.\n\n&gt; Dr.: \"I understand. Let's see, then. We'll begin with the right eye.\"\n\nI leaned towards the lenses of the machine and began reading. By the third row she asked me to slow down because she wasn't able to tick the boxes on her sheet as quickly as I was reading. By the fourth of six rows she asked me stop. She explained to me that if I didn't make a mistake so far, my eyesight is considered 100%.\n\nWe proceeded with the left eye. This time I had to focus much harder as I reached the fourth row and she let me continue to read the fifth row.\n\n&gt; Dr.: \"Okay, hold for a moment. Sit straight and close your eyes for a moment, please.\" ... \"Open them again and look at the wall behind the machine. Don't stare. Blink if you feel like it\".\n\nShe reached over to the side of the machine and flipped a switch.\n\n&gt; Dr.: \"Please read only the fourth row once again.\"\n\nThe openings of the rings were different now. It was easier this time but not as easy as it was with the right eye earlier.\n\n&gt; Dr.: \"Your eyesight is excellent. Your left eye is slightly weaker than the right but that's nothing to be concerned about at all. It makes sense to repeat the test every few years or when you feel like your eyesight is getting worse but I really say that to everyone.\"\n\nI asked her what she thinks happened to me at (competing company). She told to me that they didn't let me relax my eyes, which is simply unnatural, and the importance of understanding the test because in reality the brain always has a chance to adapt. She made me understood that we actually \"see with our brains\". Eyesight can also differ greatly from day to day but that wouldn't cause the result of the day before and the brain will simply adapt without us realizing it in most cases. Small infections like a common cold can also have a huge impact on day by day eyesight.\n\nI thanked her, paid, got my receipt and left with a smile.\n\n----\n\nTL;DR: Some things are too important to be dealt with by amateurs.",

I looked up the stores hours and number they should have been open for two more hours but my four phone calls went unanswered. \n\nThe next I called and finally got a hold of a manager while trying to explain the situation she was having a full on conversation with someone in front of her. Strike 1. \nShe kept making me repeat myself and started to have an attitude. \n\nI sent my brother in law back up there to get a refund or exchange. She immediately had an attitude with him but gave him the $1.08 refund. No apology or anything. \n\nHe went to look at the other candy bars and found all of them were expired and not a single employee cared. They're still sitting on the shelf being sold to other non suspecting people. \n\nObviously I've contacted corporate. Two year old chocolate bars shouldn't be sold and the way the manager handled the situation or lack there of was incredibly ridiculous. \n\nAm I in the wrong for expecting at least an apology? \n\nEdit: Words are hard. \n\nUpdate: Found out someone got fired because of this situation. I found out when my brother in law returned and the cashier called me a bitch to him and complained that I shouldn't have called corporate on them. Corporate obviously disagrees being as how someone lost their job over this. \n\n",

Placed my small order, stood off to the side to wait while they took other orders behind me. I wait. And wait. And watch as the people behind me in line got their orders before mine. About 15 minutes or so later, the guy who was working drive thru came around to the front and apologized for the wait, it'd be up in a moment, etc. The lady working the front also apologized.  \n\nThen the guy from the kitchen comes up with two bags that were way more full than they should have been, given I had only ordered 3 items. I start to ask him if he was sure that was my order, and he tells me to just \"enjoy\" and apologized for the wait as well. I about broke down in tears and managed a small thank you when I saw that he had basically doubled my order to make up for the minor inconvenience.  \n\nIt may not seem like a lot, but for someone who was having an extremely bad week due to anxiety flareups, it really made my day a lot better. I made sure to take their customer satisfaction survey and I think I may try to call their location tomorrow to see about telling their manager what amazing employees they were/",

The lights behind the dash stopped working, making it impossible to see the speedometer at night.\n\nWe brought it in, and the owner told us that \"You can fix it yourself, or I can fix it and charge fifty bucks an hour.\" He told us to go to a junkyard, pick out the part that was failing, and told us exactly how to fix the problem, down to which screws in the dash to remove. It took about ten minutes, not exactly a difficult fix.\n\nThey gave up business, but earned a family of longstanding customers for a decade and counting. I was reminded of this when all three of our vehicles stopped working in a one week period. We took all three to that same shop.\n\nWe own nothing but junkers in our family, so they fail pretty often. Now that my work situation requires me to have a card, I'll probably bring it there too.\n\nThey chose to lose one small job, and gained ten years of jobs in return.",

I work at a liquor store, and I understand how hard it is to keep cool while having a bad day and not take it out on the customer. Sometimes you just can't count to ten fast enough though (Those of you in sales know exactly what I mean). \n\nI went into a gas station on a busy side of town and the place was packed with people on a Monday. I filled up my truck with gas but decided to wait a few minutes for the rush of customers to clear up before going inside. Immediately after opening the front door, it was painfully obvious to me that the clerks were both running on a lean mixture. The cheese fell of their crackers a long time ago. I walk by a small line of customers that was much larger five minutes ago and get my coffee and go wait in line. These clerks were pissed, and that I can understand (an endless flow of customers that won't stop will certainly test anyone's patience). When it was my turn in line I walked up with my money in hand to speed things up (Cashiers cannot express enough that paying should not be a surprise, HAVE YOUR MONEY READY). I said to the cashier whos face read a poorly hidden 'fuck you',.. \"Pump 4, this coffee, pack of reds and a number 8\" (scratch ticket). The cashier tossed the cigarettes on the counter after ringing them, slapped buttons like he was in a hurry to answer a phone on the last ring. \"What size coffee?\" (Asking me in the tone a cop would ask how fast I was going after pulling me over). \"Which ticket\" (In an exhausted relief knowing that this transaction was almost done for him) Just being a complete son-of-a-bitch with every word. You know the type, an impatient dick that surely regrets submitting that application! A total asshole.\n\nOk, I've always been very good at placating but DAMN! Go get high or something and stop being a prick to people!\n\nLong story short, I won $50,000 on that scratch ticket and that guy ain't getting jack from me!\n\nAny ideas on what I should do with the $500 I would've tipped?

The kid working the register had been there like a month and this was his first job, we'll call him NG for new guy,  we'll call this woman CB for cinnamonbun bitch.\n\nNG: \"I'm sorry, we don't have any of the 8 packs left, we only have the 12 packs\"\n\nCB: \"How can you already be out? You just opened? This is ridiculous! Don't mess with my cinnamon rolls!\"\n\nNG: \"The rolls are in the oven, we're just waiting for them to finish up, if you want to wait we'll have them. Or you can take some of 12 packs.\"\n\nCB: \"This is outrageous! I drove THIRTY minutes to get these cinnamon rolls, THIRTY MINUTES! \"\n\nNG: \"Ma'am, they are in the oven, it will just be a few minutes. \"\n\nCB: \"Well I can't wait! How can you ask me to wait? I am expected back at breakfast RIGHT NOW! If I don't show up with these I'm DEAD, do you hear me? DEAD! I'm not joking, they will lock me out of Christmas!\"\n\nAt this point I'm really having a hard time biting my tongue, this kid is trying his best and the staff behind him are furiously icing and baking.

What the hell is that about?\"\n\nNG: \"They'll get stale, just leave them in the counter, reheating instructions are on the box.\"\n\nCB: \"Whatever, incompetent kid, make sure you throw in extra icing and you better not charge me for them.

        "text": "So I guess maybe I come out a bitch in this story. So be it. \n\nOne of our local theaters does a limited run each winter on selected children features. Nothing new, just newish. The past year it happened Frozen was still a thing, although it was way beyond dvd release. My toddler is crazy about Frozen so I get tickets. Good way to start imparting on her cinema behavior.\n\nThis thing is jammed with every 2 to 10 and parent  body they can fill. Nearly all of us is there and seated on time. To be fair they delay the starting time because of the audience. Whatever. Far from me to tell you kids are hard to settle.\n\nNow the next part don't get me wrong...I have nothing against people with handicaps. The movie was 25 minutes in and a family came in with a obviously disabled family member. They brought them to the spot for disabled guests, and those guest seated there were asked to relocate.\n\nThe problem came when they brought much more guests into the room. They had a large group...and they expected us all in the back row to move to accommodate. For a one person with a handicap. Which they already fulfilled the requirements of.\n\nI dunno. These people were asking people to relocate all over the theater in whatever empty seats were left so they could sit together. I honestly told them to to fuck off because... why did we wait? Why did we wait in the line to get in for good seats if you and your 20+ members were just gonna come and claim rights to the good seats? The disabled person in your party has care, so the additional seats aren't required to seat as care support. I am in no way trying to decline a disabled person their right to someone near by.\n\nI still had employees try to get us to give up our  seats. How am I supposed to help with my kid if she is seated two rows over? I know you want to offer excellent customer service to that other kid's family but having two rows worth of people that didn't show up on time? You had nearly a whole theater capacity worth of viewers that were there on time. \n\nI didn't feel good about saying no I refuse to move, but damn. I am here with a small child and from what I can see that group is all teens and adults. They can manage.\n\nEdit: Just to address.. I have no idea why this theater  allowed people in so long after starting time. Any other theater I have been to doesn't do that. My best guess was that they didn't want to start a scene by turning this family away. \n\n",

We were seated upstairs since every table downstairs were occupied and well, I should've known that being seated upstairs would mean being eventually forgotten. We put in our orders for drinks, pho, and appetizers, and since our pho came out rather quickly I thought that service was going to be decent. Well our drinks didn't come till more than half an hour later (which it shouldn't have taken that long to take since half of us just ordered water) and the tofu spring rolls I ordered never came. Our server never even went back upstairs to check on us. Eventually I did get my spring rolls but that was because I relayed my problem to a busser who came upstairs to clean other customers' tables. And he was the one who brought my forgotten food up instead of our actual server. Yeah I could've gone downstairs and reminded them but I shouldn't have to do that as it's the server's responsibility to check on the customers periodically. ",

        "text": "Hi Reddit! This is my second time posting on this subreddit and I hope this one is good. \n\n A few years ago, my mother and I decided to go to Iowa to visit family. We made a reservation at a hotel a month in advance. When we got to the hotel lobby, it smelled awful and it looked unclean. We already paid our  deposit so we decided to stay.\n\nThe lady at the front desk was really sweet and there were no problems checking in. When we got to our room, the bed was unmade, the bathroom was filthy and it smelled like cigarettes. We went downstairs to tell the front desk lady and she said she put us in the wrong room. She apologized and gave us the keys to another room. \n\nThe next room was even worse. It looked like someone was still in the room. There were clothes on the floor, it was dirty and there were still suitcases there. We again went downstairs and told her. She got snappy and went upstairs to check. She came back downstairs and said she would give us another room. My mom said no thanks and wanted a refund. The lady refused at first and then, called the owner of the hotel. After speaking to the owner of the hotel, she started screaming how she was going to quit and she hated her job.After 40 minutes of waiting, we finally got a refund and left that disgusting place. \n\n\nMini Story: My family and I recently went to Milwaukee. The hotel was a four star hotel. The hotel lobby was very nice. However when we got into our room the window was half open, wouldn't close all the way, and there was no screen. In addition, all night people would knock on our door and scream in the hallways. \n\n",

        "text": "This happened about 2.5 years ago, but I remembered it as I was commenting on another post.  \n\nOver the course of several weeks, I noticed that the steering wheel on my Jeep would vibrate strongly, almost to the point of shaking, when I drove above 60mph. Since I had purchased the car, I had moved.  The dealership where I bought it was now about an hour away from my new home, so I made an appointment at another dealership about 20 minutes away from my house.  The appointment was for 8am on a Thursday morning. I brought it in, explained the problem, and took a seat in the waiting room. \n\nAbout two hours later, the service guy who checked me in and was assigned to my car hadn't come and updated me, despite my seeing other service employees coming to the waiting area and talking to customers, so I went to the service desk for an update.  Since this was a few years ago, I can't remember exactly what he said, but the gist of it was that they hadn't gotten to my car yet and it wouldn't be ready until at least the end of the day.  None of this was a good sign, since I had brought my car in first thing in the morning and felt that they should have at least done some preliminary diagnostics at that point. Every other dealership I have ever been to at least has an update within the first hour or so. But what could I really do? I was already there with my car.  \n\nI called a good friend that lives close to the dealership and asked her if she could pick me up and drive me home (I have a second car, so I didn't really care how long the Jeep would be in the shop).  Friend said yes, but it would have to be on her lunch hour, so maybe 1.5-2 hours.  Not ideal, but, again, I didn't have a lot of options.\n\nAfter speaking to my friend, I went back and spoke to the service guy.  I *specifically* told him, \"I have a friend coming to pick me up, but she's going to be at least an hour, so I'll be in the waiting room if you need to talk to me and I'll let you know when I leave.\"\n\nAt around noon, friend texts to let me know that she's on her way.  I go up to let the service guy know that I was leaving, and I notice that my Jeep is parked in the area just outside the service bay.  It hadn't been there previously.  \n\nMe: \"Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I was leaving.\" Points to Jeep.  \"That's my car, have you guys looked at it?\"\n\nService Guy (SG):  \"Oh, yeah, I thought you left.  My service manager test drove your car.  He couldn't replicate the problem.\"\n\nMe (extremely frustrated and hangry at this point):  \"I've been sitting in the waiting room for four hours.  Why didn't you tell me someone was going to test drive my car?  I would have gone with them as I can definitely replicate the issue.\"\n\nSG: \"You said you were leaving.\"\n\nMe: \"I told you that I had someone coming to pick me up but I would let you know when I left in case you had any questions. And even if you thought I had left, you should have called me when you had an update about my car.\"\n\nSG (he literally says something very close to this): \"I don't know if you've noticed, but we've been very busy this morning.\"\n\nAt that point I lost it.  Normally when dealing with customer service issues, I'm very calm and rational, give people the benefit of the doubt, and try to work towards a solution, but this guy was just arrogant and pissing me off to no end, aside from simply not doing his job.  The waiting room was about 20 feet from his desk, and was separated from the service department by a glass wall.  All he would have had to do was look up, perhaps walk a few feet, and he would have seen that I was still there.  But what really pushed me over the edge was him telling me how busy they were.  That, to me, is an absolute no-no in any service oriented business.  Not only is that not an excuse (I made an early morning appointment to avoid any backups in the service dept.), but an employee should not be essentially saying to a customer, \"Too bad you're not being taken care of, we're busy, deal with it.\"\n\nMe (not yelling or cursing, but with a raised voice and very obviously pissed off):  \"I don't care if you're busy.  That isn't my problem.  I've seen several other service people come into the waiting room multiple times and speak to customers and I've been in there for four hours and you haven't come in there once to speak to me.\"  Okay, I was probably yelling.\n\nAt this point, the service manager, the one that supposedly test drove my car, comes over.  I again go over what has happened.  I asked him if he took my car on the highway, how fast he went, ect.  He tells me the route he drove, that he got up to 70mph and couldn't feel anything wrong.  He then says that we could go right now and do another test drive together. \n\nMe: \"I can't go right now.  My friend is here to drive me home.  I've been sitting in the waiting room since 8am, I could have gone at any point in the last four hours.  You know what?  Just give me my key.  I'm taking my car and going home.\"\n\nSG: \"Okay, I'll just have to complete the paperwork, just give me a few minutes...\"\n\nMe: \"Paperwork for what???  You haven't done anything.  I don't care about your paperwork, just give me my key.\"\n\nSG: \"Really, it should only take...\"\n\nMe, almost shaking with anger: \"Give me my key right now.\"\n\nSG hands me my key.  \"So, when would you like to bring your car back to be looked at?\"\n\nMe:  \"Are you kidding me?  You think I'm really bringing my car back here?\"\n\nAnd then I left.  My friend was outside waiting for me, and I had to explain what happened and that I didn't need a ride after all.\n\nSo I leave the dealership, get on the interstate, hit about 65mph and the steering wheel starts shaking.  \n\nIt turned out that my car needed an alignment and the tires needed to be balanced.  A few people that I spoke to about this, that know about cars (I know nothing about cars), said, from just me describing the issue, that it sounded like an alignment and/or balancing issue.  Yet the idiots in the dealership couldn't figure this out or even venture a guess as to what the problem was.\n",

        "text": "First time posting and on mobile. Sorry for mistakes in advance! It is also long.\n\nSo I decided to try a new restaurant not too long ago with a friend. Without being too obvious this is one of those places that you  pick out your own ingredients. I've never been to this particular place before, but my friend has and I get the concept. We have sleeping kids in the car so for the sake of saving everyone's sanity we decide to take turns inside ordering then take it back to my place to eat. Simple.\n\nI go first. I try to be friendly with the lady behind the counter and admit this is my first time ordering here. No response. Okay not a biggie. Maybe she isn't a big talker. We get to the portion were you pick out extra toppings. Some of this is really funky stuff that I've haven't tried. I ask if there is anything she would suggest. She just shrugs.\n\nOkay.. maybe they aren't supposed to make suggestions. Oh well. I pick out my stuff and we make it to the till were another worker is. The cashier and I have a friendly conversation while the first woman just stands there, nodding or shrugging. I pay and go outside to let my friend go in.\n\nNow I can see everything from the car. The woman that helped me suddenly becomes all smiles and laughy with my friend. I am confused at this point because this is the complete opposite of what I just experienced. I can't figure out if I somehow unknowingly rubbed this lady the wrong way.\n\nWhen my friend comes back out I voice how odd the whole thing was while she just quietly sits there. Then the bombshell comes: the woman inside (not knowing that my friend knew me, I guess she didn't notice us getting out of the same car) was joking about me and how she intentionally didn't do a good job with my food because I looked like a 'entitled whitey' and that I should be on my own side of town. My friend and the worker are African-American. Honestly I don't get what she meant by the side of town comment. The side of town we were in is more of a shopping hub.\n\nWe both didn't know what to think of that. My friend asked to see what my food looked like. Honestly? It looked like complete trash next to hers presentation-wise. I didn't know they were supposed to look pretty like hers did. \n\nNormally I wouldn't complain... but what a completely fucked up reason to not give good service. My friend waited outside with our kids while I went back in. Talked to a manager and retold what had happened. Showed her the food. The whole time this lady is just standing off to the side shooting daggers my way. \n\nLook lady... it wasn't a racial thing until you made it into one. Up until you bragged to my friend I just assumed you were having a bad day. I didn't want free anything. I just wanted to make sure your management knew you were being shitty towards people. What they do with that information is up to them. Frankly if you got fired or suspended from this situation... well that is on you.\n\nI ended up keeping the food, but I haven't been back. For all I know she is still there. Sorry it is sorta anticlimactic, but I had to get it out there.",

        "text": "Today I decided to do a good deed, and as everyone knows no good deed goes unpunished.  Out of habit I bring my doctor's office donuts because they have to deal with my children.  The ladies love it and I love that they interact well with my kids.  For New Year's Eve my son decided that spending the night in the ER with a broken finger sounded like a good time.  Therefore, today we to meet with the surgeon who will be putting in the pins tomorrow.  All of that info is to explain why I stopped to get donuts and I was in a small rush.  \n\nNow I understand that me being in a rush is not the fault of the doughnut people and I had no intention of being rude to them for it.  This story isn't about the amazing sugar filled doughnut mavens but rather a moronic customer in line.  I pull up to the calorie carnival and get in line behind several cars.  The car directly in front of me is a large white SUV.  Several cars then line up behind me.  We sloooowwwwly inch our way to the window (there is no speaker box you have to order, pay, and pickup at the one window).  Finally, I arrive with about ten minutes to spare (plenty of time to get to my destination) as I pull up I notice that the SUV has only pulled up far enough for me to get to the window.  No big deal it will take a couple of minutes for my order (they were making the glazed ones fresh mmmmmm) So I proceed to order and wait patiently.  However, the SUV is not moving, she is not leaving nor has she gotten out of the SUV she is just sitting there.  \n\nAfter a few minutes the doughnut divas hand out my food and drinks and I distribute them to my begging beasties.  Then I notice the SUV is still sitting there.  It has been at least five minutes which is an eternity at the drive through.  As I sit there the doughnut diva comes back to the window and asks if I needed something else.  I tell her no, but is the lady ahead of me waiting on something?  The diva informs me that no she is not waiting on anything.  The diva then leaves the window and goes out to the SUV and knocks on the window.  They exchange words and diva returns back to the store.  Another couple minutes goes by and people are honking horns as there are now around seven cars behind me in line and there is no way for me to back up.  I knock on the window and the diva comes back and tells me that the lady didn't need anything and she asked her to pull forward so the line could move.  \n\nI start honking my horn because I can't possibly get out I'm only inches away from her bumper and the car behind me is the same.  Another minute goes by and the diva goes out again and I start to get out of my car and I hear the lady yelling that she has the right to park wherever she wants to!  I lay on my horn and so she finally inches (and I mean inches) ahead about a foot.  I proceed to make a twelve point turn in order to get out.  As I am passing her I look over to see her giving me the finger and eating a doughnut.  \n\nI managed to make it almost on time and the office ladies forgave me because I brought doughnuts.\n\nTL:DR; Entitled Bitch holds up everyone in line because she wanted to eat her doughnuts.",

        "text": "Obligatory comment about being a long time lurker and first time poster...\n\nOnline shopping is amazing. You click some buttons, send money and a box appears at your door a few days later. I can probably count on one hand the number of times in the last 10 years that I've had an issue with an order, and even then, the outcome was pretty simple: contact the company, issue is resolved and we go our ways. This is not one of those times. \n\nA certain company that sells wraps and cases for electronic devices was having a pretty good sale last month, so I figured I'd get in on the action and pick up something for myself. A coworker had ordered from the same company a few days prior, received his items and I was sold on them. \n\nSo I placed my order on Dec. 7 and awaited the delivery. \n\nBy Dec. 12, it was still stuck in \"processing,\" but of course they had already taken my money. I sent a polite inquiry through their Facebook account wondering when I could hope to see a tracking number. I didn't get a response until the next day, but they did provide a tracking number. Awesome!\n\nFast forward to Dec. 17 and the package arrives. The wraps are there, but the case I ordered is not. I tried calling the support number a few time and was greeted after one ring with a message saying \"no support agents are currently available to take your call.\" Ok then, back to Facebook. This time it's two days before I get a reply and they tell give me a tracking number, saying it was sent on the 12th. Except it's the same tracking number for the original package without the case. \n\nAt this point, there was no further response from them. \n\nI opened up a dispute through [redacted online payment option] since I wasn't getting anywhere with them asking for either a refund or the missing items. \n\nNo response. \n\nBy Dec. 29, I had yet to receive a response and their Facebook page had numerous commenters with similar issues- either missing items or orders stuck in processing purgatory. I should also mention there was no sign of my missing item. I then decided to escalate the dispute since there was no response. \n\nToday, I logged into the payment vendor and of course there's no response. They've still got a few days before...something happens, I guess?\n\nThe real fun is when I checked their Facebook page again. All those commenters who had the same issue as me? Deleted, along with mine. I've also been blacklisted from posting to their page, or they turned comments off since they were getting complaints. Either way, it seems they spend more time cleaning up their social media pages rather than actually addressing the complaints. \n\nMaybe one of these days my missing case will show up, but even if it does, there's no way in hell I'll buy from these guys again. \n\nTL;DR - Company omits item from order, then goes dark when called out on missing item. But they've got my money, so why bother with any kind of customer service?",

        "text": "The only place to get snacks or drink near my work is a dollar store located at the end of our strip plaza, so we frequently run over and grab things for ourselves or other employees at our store. Our T-shirts are solid black, have a huge picture of our logo covering the front of the shirt, and say STAFF on the upper back side in very unique looking letters that match the front.\n \n  \n\nIt wasn't too busy at our shop, so I volunteer to run over and get some snacks for everyone. While I'm standing at the candy, this nice old couple -OC- (had to be in their 80's), asks me where something is. Being a regular, I know the dollar store like the back of my hand, but not being sure if they have it in stock, I say,\n&gt;M: I'm not sure if they have it, but if they did, it would be in [particular area]. \n\n&gt;OC: Aren't you going to show us? \n\n&gt;M: What? \n\n&gt;OC: You're supposed to help us, that's your job isn't it? \n\n&gt;M: Uh.. I don't work here, I was just trying to be helpful. \n\n&gt;OC: But your shirt says STAFF on the back of it!\n\n  \n\n  \nI face towards them and point to the giant front of my shirt, that has the name and logo of the store I work at and say,\n\n&gt;M: Yes, I'm staff at [store I work at]. I just ran a few stores over to grab something for the staff. \n\n&gt;OC: Well, you shouldn't be wearing a STAFF shirt in here! At this point, I'm getting irritated at the snappy old man. \n\n&gt;M: Am I supposed to go and change my shirt every time I step in another store? \n\n&gt;OC: Yes!!! \n\n&gt;M: scoffs Have a nice day.\n\n  \n\n  \nMind you, the staff shirts for the store I was in are plain green collared shirts, with a tiny logo on the breast. My shirt looked more like a black band shirt with a gothic/Halloween picture sprawled across the front - I don't want to be specific so I will say it was either a ghost, skull, reaper, or spider to give you an idea. I don't know how anyone could mistake that for an employee shirt where I was at.\n  \n\n  \nI'll never understand how instead of apologizing, people react with a sense of, 'you don't work here? Well, now you are obliged to help me since I mistook you for an employee!'",

This one particular shop on there had 5 stars from numerous users, pretty good choice to go with right?\n\nSo I order a pedal from them and like most things the pedal will ship that day or the next day and it'll be two day shipping or something. On the 30th I messaged them and asked them when my pedal will ship. Never got a response. I figure they might've been busy cause of holidays so will wait some more. It's now January 1 and I still have no response from them and my pedal didn't ship.\n\nNormally I don't mind if my orders are delayed but I was hoping to have that pedal by tomorrow. That pedal didn't ship for almost a week. Worst of all, the shop acknowledged my refund but not my message. On a side note, I went to the shops website to see if I could contact anyone there. They have a live chat thing for support and such. It was down but was like 12 am so figured no one's working. Next day I check it out again and what do you know, there really is no one for the live chat.\n",

Like an idiot, I had a $1K deductible. \n\nTake it to the dealer, their estimate is $1750. Insurance cuts me a check for $750. Shop proceeds to keep my car for a month, finally calls to tell me its done. \n\nIts 5pm on a Friday, the only people there are the manager and an office admin.  Admin prints out a bill and the manager presents it to me: $4800.  What?\n\nHe says they did the original estimate using the parts list for a regular model, since mine is the AMG version, everything is three times as much. \n\nNot my problem. They should have contacted the insurance company with the new estimate. \n\nWe are arguing. The manager's truck is in the driveway, with a boat on a trailer, he's clearly wanting to get out of there and I'm certainly not paying an extra $3 grand. I'm also not leaving without my car, and I'm getting pretty mad. \n\nFinally he throws his hands in the air and says, fine, just write us a check for $750.  The admin gives me a look - she knew it was supposed to be $1750. But she didn't say a thing. \n\nSo...great! I cut that check and drive away. \n\n15 months later I get a call from the dealership, saying they were going through their records and realized I owed them $1K\n\nI laughed, said I have a receipt that says paid in full, so no, I don't owe you a thing. \n\nEnded up going back there many times because that POS car always had something breaking, most of it covered by the warranty. \n",

I open it up, and I am stunned. Inside the envelope are 5 $20 bills and 10 $1 bills. What happened here? Why did I receive cash in a mailed envelope from a local chain grocery store which was one block from my home?",
