        "text": "TL;DR: I think I may have caused a divorce, and I don't I don't think anyone regrets it one bit. \n\nYears ago, while working in the auto and home insurance world, I get a call. The caller wants to remove her husband from the policy. I do some basic underwriting and she tells me that they are divorced and she says he has new insurance elsewhere. \n\nAlright, no problem, what I need to do is call him and just find out what date his policy started and if I have his consent to remove him. She starts to get pissed but I explain to her, I can't legally remove someone from a policy without their consent. I tell her that she wouldn't like it if someone called in to remove her from her own policy without her knowledge. So, I need to call him... \n\nAt this point she starts yelling at me, throwing profanity after profanity. She tells me, I have no business calling him, and that I should do as I'm told. She has decided that my name is now \"boy\" and from this point on talks to me like I'm a child. \n\nFine, I'll write a new policy. \n\n*my smile intensifies* \n\nIt hasn't dawned on her yet that the new policy would be lacking renewal credits and multi-car discount. Even better, she hasn't realized that the accident she had two years ago would no longer be forgiven, and the speeding ticket she just had would be chargeable now, vs the renewal. \n\n\"Alright, your new policy price for you and your vehicle is $xxxx.xx, and that will start effective today. Your new monthly payments are....\" \n\n I'm cut off by what could only be described as a demonic scream, followed by more mother fucks than a Jay and Silent Bob film. I explain in lengthy detail why her individual vehicle price has now increased. But then suddenly, exactly what I was expecting her to say...\n\n\"Don't remove me, just leave the policy as is.\"\n\nSo I nicely explain to her that, since she won't let me speak to the ex, that this is what I had to do. (I actually had his cell number, it was right on the notes of the policy, but I wanted her to form the conclusion this was her fault own fault for putting me in this position) I explain, that since they aren't married, the vehicles aren't co owned, that she had no business being on the same policy as him (company rules). \n\nShe becomes enraged, and tells me that she doesn't accept the policy. I explain, because of the information she's divulged, and since she's still our client, I have to insure her accurately. I can't knowingly give her a lapse, and I'm not leaving the policy as it is. It would be no different from if you told me you moved, but then realized the price went up, and told me to leave the policy as is. It doesn't work that way. \n\nThe next thing she says totally shocks me. \"Ok, we aren't actually divorced, but he's a lying, hateful piece of shit. I wanted him to get arrested for driving without insurance.\" \n\nI'm sitting there, just trying to appreciate the magnificent of her stupidity. The irony of complaining about your lying husband when you've just spent 30 mins in a web of lies because you want to get him arrested? Nope, fuck this woman in particular if she thinks I'm going to believe anything she says. Fuck her if she doesn't realize that I too can be a piece of shit, except I get paid for it.\n\nSo I tell her I'm going to place her on hold, while I see if I can get approval to terminate the change. In reality, I'm actually documenting our conversation into the notes on the policy, and I giving the husband a call. He's retired, so he's quick to pick up. After verifying that it's him, I start filling him in on what's happening. \n\n\"Hi this is YourMom, from Insurance company. I have Mrs.McLiarPants on the other line, and I'm calling to get some verification on some new information. She called in to remove you from the policy stating that you were divorced, but after she found out her price would go up in doing so, she changed her story stating that she isn't divorced.\"\n\nHe confirms that they aren't divorced. He's glad I called to to verify since he's currently driving across country to visit family. I document his statement, and I tell him I'm going to make a note to verify with him prior to making any changes that would impact him. He then asks if I can email him an ID card and some form of proof that I'm terminating the transaction I started with his wife, which I tell him I will. \n\nBack to the wife. I tell her that I've documented everything she's said and that from this point forward we will verify with the husband before removing any driver or vehicle. She calls me a fuck and tells me that I better not call and tell him. Which I politely explain that I'd never CALL him to tell him that. I place myself into \"after call,\" tell her to have a wonderful day and thank you for calling, to which she response with a fuck you and hangs up.\n\nAfter the call, I pull up a form letter of unable to complete as requested, and I filled in the blanks where it allows me to. \n\n\"Dear Mrs...We have received your request to remove your husband from the policy, in order to, as you said on our phone call \"get him arrested.\" We regret to inform you that the change can not be completed as requested as alternate insurance is not in place and this transaction would cause a lapse of insurance. Please contact us if you have further questions.\"\n\nI emailed the husband that along with an ID card. I terminated the transaction, made sure my notes on the convos were thorough and went to lunch. \n\nI had actually forgotten all about it until one day, probably two or three years later, I was working correspondence. I'm attaching corr that we've received to the corresponding policies, when what do I find? It's paperwork from Mrs McLiarPants! I only recognized it because of my book of notes. Apparently, now she IS getting a divorce, but because of said notes, she had to send in proof. She sent in a copy of his and her separate addresses, and some other papers on the divorce. \n\nFrom the notes on each contact ive found she, continued to lie and scream at reps, threatened to get other insurance, realized we were the cheapest and tried to get her price lower by dropping her liability to the minimum limits. She had requested a manager on almost every single call, since mine.\n\nHere's the worst part. It had been like 6 months since her last phone call to us. She randomly faxed in a request to remove full coverage because she claimed her vehicle was paid off. It was not, and as such we received a letter from the bank telling us to add comp and collision back and send proof. Apparently per notes, we tried to call her (I doubt anyone even tried), and since we couldn't confirm what deductible for comp and collision she should have, per guidelines we added it back on at $100/$250 respectively vs the $1000/$1000 she had before. \n\nHer electronic withdrawal failed as a result of the increased premium. She was now a few days away from being cancelled. I call her to see if she's even aware, expecting a shit show. She answers, and is absolutely a fucking sweetheart. She didn't realize it was going to be cancelled. I explain the minimum due, and even go as far and tell her how happy I was to come across this when I did. \n\nShe makes the payment over the phone with me, I talk to her about the full coverage and explain what happened and why. She tells me how she's been having financial trouble since her divorce and that's the reason she removed the physical damage coverage. I ask if she has some time for me to look over her policy, to which she agrees. I'm looking for missed credits or really anything, because apparently I'm feeling charitable. \n\nFor whatever reason, she's telling me a little about her divorce. She's describing it as a blessing and a curse. She's so happy to be away from him, but it's taken a toll financially the last few months, but even still she wouldn't trade it for anything. My eyes start welling up with tears because at that point, my parents were in the midst of ending their physically and emotionally abusive relationship. I had a feeling her demeanor changed the moment they weren't together. \n\nIn the time between my initial call with her and now, we've released a new rating plan. It's pretty much hit or miss; when it saves a customer money it REALLY saves them money. So while we are talking I start the quote under the new plan. Just her vehicle, just her as a driver, and wouldn't you know it, its good news! With the correction to the deductible, removing the ex and his vehicle (now that we had proof), and the change in the rating plan, she went from something like $2100/year (her individual vehicle was about $100) to like $750. \n\nSo, being the prick I am, I start to tell her in a sad voice, \"ya know, I've looked and done everything I could possibly do....\" and she fuckin cuts me off and says, \"I know sweetheart, I wasn't expecting you to do everything that you already have...\" and then I cut her off. \"I'm just sorry, I could only save you $1350 a year. I just couldn't find anything else. So, I guess your new premium will have to just be $750.\" \n\nShe erupts into \"god bless you, god bless you, god bless you! Ohhhhh lord, thank you Jesus!!\" \n\nI just sit there pulling the headset away slightly to keep my hearing intact. \n\nShe comes back, \"oh my god! What did you say your name was again, I want to tell your manager how wonderful you are!\" I tell her that the phone calls are recorded and she'll know (I just didn't want my manager involved. It does me no good and god forbid they pull up that passive aggressive letter I emailed years earlier.)\n\nI explain to her that I'll activate this policy once her payment for the current policy she made with me posts. I'll then transfer over all credit and I let her know what her approximate monthly payment will be. I talk to her about being honest with us and that we are always more than happy to help in any way I can. I confirm her address, phone number and email address and wish her a wonderful day.\n\nI set a reminder for myself for 48 hours, to go back and check billing and then activate this policy and cancel her old one. \n\nTwo days later, I pull up her account and payment went through. I activate the account, set her up on repetitive EFT, and sent out all her paperwork. \n\nHopefully I made the right decision in giving her another chance. I don't condone her previous actions, but at some point everyone deserves a fresh start.\n\n\n",

Finally tells me that she needs to remove her husband from the policy because he died. This lady seemed SO sincerely devastated it broke my heart. I spent an excessive amount of time with her listening all about her husbands cancer and his passing. Went through her policy trying to get her every possible financial break, I just felt so bad for her. A few days later I get a call for the same policy but this time from the husband.....I tell him that his wife had removed him because she said he died. All I hear on the other line is laughter and then \"That stupid b*tch.\" Turns out it was just a really bitter divorce. ",

        "text": "Okay I want to make a post about surveys and why they should be eliminated. Hear me out on this. \n\nI think surveys if done correctly are good tools but most call centers this is not the case. Ive only worked in 2 call centers but in those 2 surveys were you secondary MAJOR metric that made or break you. \n\nHere is a big problem I mainly see customers view surveys as generally inquiry into the company itself. Even if it says in email its about this call or this person still consistently they see it as a form of contact to vent to the company. \n\nThis is problematic in itself especially if you work for a place like me and you cannot challenge these and you are held fully accountable for them 100%. I have seen one company \"Comcast\" I got a survey from them and in big BOLD text it said THIS IS A SURVEY ABOUT \"PERSON\" YOU CHATTED WITH NOT ABOUT COMCAST AT ALL AND WILL NOT BE REVIEWED BY COMCAST OTHER THEN TO EVALUATE THE EMPLOYEE YOU SPOKE WITH. \n\nI was really shocked by this and dont understand why more places dont do this. Peoples lives rely on these surveys and their entire system is flawed. Phone surveys people push the wrong buttons email surveys people just get mad. \n\nDont get me wrong I get bad ass surveys sometimes and its a great feeling and I feel like it can really show a job well done however. This system is flawed I know they want to be unbaised and get neutral data alot of companies ive called never mention what the survey is about so if im mad at that company some kid is getting screwed by me. \n\nMy major reason I think surveys are bad are because they encourage cheating, low self esteem and stress. How is someone being mad at a product or the company a call reps fault? Now im basing this off of companies ive worked for maybe there are better companies but I feel like when you do things like this is sends a message that its not the companies fault but YOURS. \n\nSo what is the point of having a survey IF 1. Your marketing team doesnt take ownership of them and aggregate data trends. 2. Rather then doing 1 you just blame some guy making 10/hr and the fire him.  So rather then listen to the voice of customers to improve marketing you perpetuate a cycle. At that point what is the purpose of customer satisfaction. \n\nI GET IT that this is a metric to see how well your staff does with soft skills and customer support operations but more companies need to be more transparent about these. \n\nMaybe on the phone or email they could say This first survey is a general marketing survey for you to address any concerns about the company, its products or its services NOT the phone call. \n\nThen: This last part of the survey is ONLY about the phone call you had with JOHN SMITH on 10/28/2016 do you wish to proceed?\n\nMaybe I just work for a poor company but I feel like that this is not a consistent format. I will tell you why, First month im in average-poor surveys. second-fourth month highest surveys in my dept. Note most people were also high maybe a trend? Then I go down. Then im up. Now im down. I have NOT changed a thing it is russian roulette and wether or not I got hit with someone hitting me on the company and not my call. \n\nSorry this is long but I would like opinions on this. ",

        "text": "FTP, LTL, my format sucks, I know. \n\nSo, just to give you some background on what I do, I handle accounting for an animal charity, whilst it's usually easy jobs such as paying a vet what we owe and such, sometimes we have members of the public come through to us, these are people who are at a low point in life, and can't afford emergency treatment for their pet. \nI'll give you an example, if someone's dog gets hit by a vehicle, but they have no money to pay for a vet, they can come to us. \n\nSounds good, right?\n\nThe catch: As we are a charity, we get our funding from the public, so we have to be careful about giving away public money, so the money we can give to the aforementioned people is just enough to cover pain relief for their animal, or unfortunately euthanasia. \n\nI've been doing this job for close to two years now, and at a point you become desensitised to it all, not seeing the animals and just staring at a screen mashing a keyboard gives you a 'barrier' from it all, (similar to when you read a newspaper story about a tragedy, it's not happening to you or happening in your neighbourhood, so you don't always feel a personal pain reading it). \n\nSorry for the wall of text, but let me tell you the story of how I changed my views, I realised that I actually help people, I'm not just some headset jockey in a call centre, this one person changed it all. \n\nI will be 'Me' \nMember of Public shall be 'MP'\n\nMe: \"Hello, may I speak with MP, please? My name is Rati0h, calling from the &lt;animal charity&gt;. \n\nMP: \"Hello, this is MP\"\n\nMe: \"Hello MP, I've read through what's happened and I just want to know how your tortoise is doing?\"\n\n(MP is very very clearly upset, as her tortoise has been attacked by her dog, it's not looking good folks) \n\nMP: \"She's not good, but I have managed to get her to eat a tomato\"\n\nMe: \"Fantastic, I've arranged a vets for you to go to, we have paid for the treatment for this evening\" etc etc \n\n*So, I've arranged a vet, paid the vet the maximum I can, and gotten her some transport sorted all from my office desk, I fucking tried, I spent some good time afterwards trying to find if there was anyone in her area that could help her with more funding for this tortoise, but nothing helped*\n\nI left that day at 11pm, I gave MP my office hours and my office number, and told her to call me if she needs anything. \n\nCut to the next day, it's 2pm, and I'm just getting onto taking some calls when my colleague transfers someone through. \n\nIt's MP! \n\nIt turns out she called me to give me the most stellar feedback I've ever gotten, she was saying how we helped her when no one else would. \nI ended up ruining my call scores for how long I stayed on with MP, but I was helping her out and chatting with her and trying to cheer her up, by the end of the call we were both crying. She wanted my number, and I wanted to give it to her, but legally I can't give my personal information out, or contact her outside of work. \n\nSo, in summation, I realised that even though her tortoise didn't make it, that's her pet, that's not just some words on my PC screen, and I really helped someone, I helped someone just by doing my call centre job that I've been salty about for a while. \n\nIn memorandum, I would like to dedicate this post to Pickle the tortoise, I'm sorry you didn't make it little princess, but you sounded like an absolute gem. \n\n(DPA laws prevent me from contacting this lady outside of work, even though she asked for my number, it's just something I have to accept happened.)\n\nI'm sorry if this was muddled, I just feel so changed by this experience. \n\nTL;DR - A tortoise named Pickle changed the way I see the call centre.",

        "text": "Hi guys, I have a quick yet infuriating story for you. So I work for a large company that provides help desks for multiple big brand names, I am on what's deemed in the building as the \"joke of the building\" and for good reason. \n\nMy desk provides IT and hardware support for a large fried chicken fast food chain and honestly it's a fucking miracle these stores stay open with the kind of staff they are hiring to contact us for help and the amount of problems they have in store. \n\nNow I'll be honest I know all too well fast food workers take a verbal battering from customers in store but it doesn't give you the right as a customer when you call me up for help to treat me like a cunt. They don't seem to realise that by going off on us they are just as bad as that customer that verbally abused them. Anyways, onto the story! \n\nSo I was at the end of finishing a 6 day streak and it had to end with a back to back call day, it was getting towards the end of my shift when one last call came in. We'll call this guy fucking idiot(FI for short) and me as in me: \n\nMe: Fried chicken fuck fest, customer punching bag speaking, can I confirm you're calling from *bla dee bla bla bla*?\n\nFI: Yeah I ordered a replacement card machine and cable 6 days ago and chased it multiple times and you guys haven't delivered it, what are you going to do about this because this is fucking unacceptable.\n\nMe: Right okay I'm sorry to hear that sir, can I take the reference number if you have one? \n\nFI: It's A13***** (in the background *this is a fucking joke man*)\n\nMe: Yeah based on what I'm reading this wasn't logged 6 days ago at all, this was only logged 2 days ago.\n\nFI: NO I LOGGED THIS WITH YOUR COLLEAGUE LEWIS THE OTHER DAY (there is no one on my desk called Lewis) AND HE INFORMED ME IT WOULD BE HERE THE NEXT DAY, I LOGGED THIS ON FRIDAY AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE BY NOW. YOU SUPPLY THESE CARD MACHINES SO YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.\n\nMe: Okay can I just ask you to calm down, I can let you know tha--\n\nFI: NO I WILL NOT FUCKING CALM DOWN, THIS IS BEYOND RIDICULOUS NOW, YOU NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE COME OUT TO REPLACE THIS RIGHT NOW \n\nMe: As I said, calm down and let me explain, we do not supply these card machines we simply log these reports over to the 3rd party company that supplies them. You only logged this on friday, this companies drivers don't work on the weekends so you're more than likely going to get it monday. \n\nFI: Well can you not chase it with them?\n\nMe: Even if I wanted to I can't, they are closed on the weekends so I can't get them at the moment in time. \n\nFI: WELL DO IT SOMEHOW.\n\nMe: Again, they don't work weekends, if you still haven't received it Monday call us back, have a good day.\n\nFI: I NEED THIS CARD MACHINE SORTED N--- *click*\n\nHonestly it's days like that one that I just want to jump head first out the window.

I read out the number and ask if she recognises it; she says it's a number her husband used to use, but he's had a different number for the last two years. She insists she didn't call it over the last month.\n\nNormally, a call to a mobile shows up as *&lt;country&gt; mobile*, but this one showed up as a weird code, so I call my TL over to ask what it means.

        "text": "I got my first guide dog after graduating from high school. My mom had insisted I get one, and except for a nine-day overseas trip in college, that golden retriever never left my side for more than a few hours at a time. She retired eight years later at the age of ten to go live with my niece. It’s hard to describe the relationship between a guide dog and a handler. The best I can come up with is that the dog becomes an extension of you, like another sensory organ.  You can feel the dog’s gait through the harness, where their head is pointed, and whether they’re paying attention to what’s in front of them or just staring at the cat across the street.\n\nThe day I got her was one of the most emotional in my life. We were told to wait in our rooms while the trainers introduced each person to their dog one on one, after which we were to spend the next hour petting, talking to, and comforting our new guides. I had desperately wanted a German shepherd after seeing my friend’s pet dog, who was the perfect combination of intelligence, strength, and amicability. You can imagine how deflated I felt when a petite golden retriever pranced into my room. The disappointment quickly vanished after spending some time rubbing her belly, though, and I even caught myself humming a song my parents used to sing to me when I was very little: “You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are gray, you’ll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don’t take my sunshine away.” \n\nI had been working for the local transit authority for a year when it became apparent she was ready to retire. Getting out of the car one morning at the park and ride, I opened the back door to invite her out, but instead of leaping into the harness she just stared at me as if to say, “You go ahead; I’ll just nap here.” I took three weeks from work to train with her successor, and was even sent home early because my new goldador and I were getting along so well. Thankful for the extra week of vacation time, I spent the next few days acclimating guide dog II to her new life.\n\nI had many opportunities to see the now retired dog over the next year, including plenty of play dates between guide dog emerita and guide dog II. She got noticeably chubbier after giving up her active lifestyle, no doubt exacerbated by a thyroid problem diagnosed a few years earlier. She also continued her pastime of unscheduled, unsupervised walks around the neighborhood which made both me and her new masters thankful that the school microchipped every dog. \n\nI was working for a call center at the time, booking trips on the local paratransit service. I was thankful for the job, but it was clear from almost the beginning that I couldn’t make a career out of customer service. The day before Thanksgiving was our busiest day since clients had to book their trips the business day before, and two days of vacation plus the weekend and Monday meant we had to book for five days. To compensate for the higher workload, we had to come in at 7 AM and leave at 7 PM instead of our normal 8 to 5 shift. This was my third pre-Thanksgiving soul crusher. I had been dreading it for months, but sat down in my chair that morning resigned to my fate. My goldador was in her normal position under my desk, perhaps paying the rest of her sleep debt accrued after a compulsory 4 AM wake-up call. I slipped on the gaming headset that I bought myself after a few months of Plantronics-induced ear pain, and hovered my mouse over the “ready” button on the Cisco agent desktop. It was 6:59, and I was determined as ever to open the floodgates of human contact no earlier than necessary.\n\nAt that exact moment, I felt my cell phone vibrate; someone was calling me. I’m not exactly mister social. I don’t get phone calls often, and anyone who would call me knew I would be working early, so I figured it was important. I pulled off my headset and looked at my phone; it was my dad. Now I was sure it was important, or maybe he was just butt-dialing me. A little anxious, I pressed the answer button and put the phone to my ear.\n\nMe: “hello?”\n\nDad: “Redstone1337, I’m sorry, but your dog died this morning.”\n\nI was still tired, and thought he meant our other positively ancient pet dog, a greyhound lab mix who we had since I was in ninth grade, and absolutely refused to die. She hung on until January of this year.\n\nMe: “You mean the other dog? Are you sure you don’t mean that one?”\n\nDad: “No, it was your dog. We already called the vet. We wanted to let you know in case you wanted to see her before she was cremated.”\n\nMe: “I have to go…”\n\nI hung up and ran to the conference room, my goldador trotting merrily behind me. I shut the door, threw myself into a chair, and started ~~balling like a baby~~ giving my body’s moisture to the dead. A supervisor heard my lamentations and came to check on me:\n\nSupervisor: “What’s wrong?”\n\nMe, Sobbing: “My dog died.”\n\nSupervisor: “Oh, I’m sorry. She was like a part of your family. Do you want to go home?”\n\nMe: “I’m not sure. Give me a few minutes.”\n\nAfter a few more minutes of catharsis, I decided I needed to see her one last time. I told the supervisor I was leaving, packed my backpack, logged out, and took the elevator downstairs. The next outbound park and ride bus wasn’t scheduled for quite some time, so I had to walk a few extra blocks to get on the longer local route. This turned out to be a good thing because a friend caught the same bus, and after somberly telling her the reason I was leaving downtown early and a few minutes of consolation, we chatted about other stuff for the hour or so it took to get home. After getting off the bus, I thanked her for her condolences, and waited for my brother to pick me up and take me to the vet.\n\nWe arrived at the vet a few minutes early, so I went inside and payed for her cremation. I came out to see my father pulling up in our red van, along with my sister-in-law’s sister, who, I came to find out, was the one who woke up to the unpleasant sight early that morning. My dad opened the back door. She looked like she could have been asleep, lying on her side with her legs sprawled lazily, like she used to do on the lone patch of tile by the front door of my apartment in college. We exchanged a few explanatory words, and then I sat down on the bumper and started stroking her chest. Every dog has that one spot they love to be scratched, and hers was her sternum. She used to gently place her forepaws on my arm, perfectly positioning my hand to rub the spot where her ribs started. Now, however, her body felt cold. There was no contended sigh, no wagging tail, no gentle breathing, she was gone. Petting a dog that had been dead for several hours may sound morbid, but I needed the closure. In between silent sobs, I started to mouth, “You are my sunshine…”\n\n",

I'm a morning person, and I've been absolutely miserable for the past several months.\n\nFrom 6pm - 10pm, I'm \"supervisor\" on duty and there's just two other CSRs. Then from 8pm-10pm, it's just me and one other person. \n\nSo, when one of the other three tier 2 reps wants a day off for vacation or they're sick...no problem. Someone else is there to cover.\n\nBut, when I need a day off. OH MY FUCKING GOD. It's like the end of the world. There *has* to be a tier 2 from 6-10 so they make me find someone to cover my shift, otherwise I'm not allowed to take the day off. So me taking a sick day or vacay day depends on one of the other three tier 2 rep's (one who lives on the opposite coast) willingness to cover my shitty hours. \n\nBut with the others, this isn't an issue (they don't have to find someone to cover, etc). This is pissing me off beyond belief. I submitted a vacation request, and if it gets rejected for this reason I'm extremely tempted to put in my 2 weeks notice two weeks before the day of my vacation. Because fuck this bullshit. ",

We all sit stunned and I immediately asked, \"What the fuck happened?\"\n\nMy supervisor, who was the nicest man I've ever worked for, said, \"I don't know.\"  We took it at face-value and took 20 minutes in an auxiliary status to process the death of someone we'd spent 40 hours a week with for the larger portion of the year.  There was an evening rush, some outage in the central region, we needed to get back out on the phones.\n\nLater, I found out Nick had shot himself in the head.  I was dumbfounded.  This guy was perpetual joy, not exuberance, but that kind of innate pleasantness that made it easy for people to say, \"That's a good guy.\"  He was effortlessly great at his job and, above all else, he was nice.\n\nI ran to a few people on my team, I said, \"Nick killed himself?\" I was met with glossy eyes, casual shrugs and just general disinterest.  It was the oddest reaction I'd ever seen, even from people I genuinely liked.  We didn't care, hell, I didn't care as much as I should've, that's why I write this now. \n\nYou can't unilaterally say the job made him kill himself, nor can you say that any company is meant to cave-in when someone is lost to inexplicable sadness, but it was one of the grimiest perspectives I've ever gained.  I don't know what possessed me or any of us to casually unburden ourselves of the thought of him so quickly.  It could've been the numbers, or the complaints, or the complete disassociation we have between our workload and our actual existence, but it was sad.  It's still sad.\n\nI left that company, but I've remained in the field and all I want to say is this:  Nick, I am sorry.  I was selfish.  I could've talked to you more.  I could've grieved a bit.  You'd say it was silly to compare a fucking tech-support job to some war that ended with you as a casualty, but I hope that's the truth.  I hope it wasn't some silly fucking numbers on a screen or the shrill cry of some waspy mid-western wife who didn't have an internet signal that pushed you over.  I hope it was something dignified.  I don't know why I am still bothered, but I hope you found some light wherever you went.\n\nRegards,\n\nJ.",

        "text": "So, to begin with, I have worked in a call center for almost 5 years, (I can almost here you gasping). It is killing me. I literally cannot find another job, and pray to get fired somedays at work. I work for a major clothing distribution company that handles multiple women's brands.\nThree years ago I was \"promoted\" to a team that doesn't require phone work, but you do have to read some of the nastiest, petty emails from horrible women. We also have to take multiple live chats at time. The verbal abuse, pettiness, and just overall rudeness have killed my will to live. I am so exhausted, mentally and emotionally by the end of my work week that I don't do anything but lay on the couch on my days off. I hate my life and pray that God will just take me. \nI spend my off days dreading work, and pretty much cry every day on my way to work. I have a supervisor that is extremely critical. You can't do anything right, unless you are the favorite. My coworkers, (excluding the favorite), are also in the same boat. They hate their jobs, and only stay there because they cannot find anything else.\nThis job is destroying me. I now have high blood pressure, have gained 50 pounds, and my anxiety is so high that I self medicate with pills, smoking, etc. I've almost used all of my FMLA and my chronic absences have made me late on almost all of my bills. I call in on the days that I just literally can't take the abuse anymore. Add to that financial stress and I just want to die. \nI'd like to hear from others that work in this hellish job. The only upside is I don't have to hear their whiny, screeching voices.\nOh, and I forgot. Taking a quick break to try and laugh with a coworker and my boss comes running down the aisle to make a smartass comment about how we can't be typing and talking. There is no downtime between the chats and emails. At least the phone people get some time between calls. We are expected to be available ALL THE TIME. Even our piddly little 15 minute breaks are frowned upon. Please God tell me there is a way out that doesn't involve suicide.",

I know who it is as soon as she tells me the bars name, apparently he was calling to apologise for over reacting on the phone to me. I've been here for nearly two years and have never had this happen to me, ever. Never heard of it happening to anyone else either. He wasn't even that bad, he was a bit frustrated because it’s a repeat issue, which is fair enough in my books that should have been sorted 5 visits ago. But he never swore, never raised his voice, never blamed me – he was just your standard slightly frustrated but overall understanding land lord. Yet he felt the need to call back and say sorry to me himself.\n\n\nI guess some people out there realise we're just people doing a job too, even when they really didn't need to apologise for anything.",

I then got CC'd on the e-mail he sent to the account rep for the company Angry Lady was working for asking if he knew of anything we would have sent back saying we declined the accomodation she had requested, or if there was any department that dealt with those types of requests, and got CC'd on his very short reply which consisted of basically \"the supervisor was right to deny the request and tell her to speak to her HR, what she wants is handled by them, it's not part of the contract\". \n\n  \nTL;DR : Angry Lady is absolutely insane and I was right.

        "text": "OK, for lack of better work, despite going to college and having more letters after my name, I am now on yet another stint working in a call center somewhere just east of the Rocky Mountains. Until I can get something better...\n\nAt any rate, one of the things I was taught when I got my degree was different philosophies of management, and one of the most infamous dates back to the turn of the 20th century, Scientific Management, aka Taylorism.\n\nTaylorism was inflicted on humanity by Frederick Winslow Taylor, who was seeking to improve the productivity of workers at industrial sites. Taylor studied workers doing jobs like shoveling ore or pig iron, or inspecting bearing balls. You know, unpleasant, repetitive, and sometimes dangerous work.\n\nBack in the day, Taylor was concerned with reducing what he called \"soldiering\", referring to soldiers doing the bare minimum when they're put to work in their army units. Other names are \"malingering\", or \"goldbricking\" or \"sandbagging\", or as the workers put it, surviving and keeping their sanity. Or in the scientific-management way of putting it, workers will work at the slowest rate that goes unpunished.\n\nTaylor's strategy was to measure, analyze, and micromanage the hell out of workers, with time and motion studies. For old-school steel mill workers hauling pig iron, this involved doing the job while a manager hovered over his ass with a stopwatch, nitpicking his work techniques, and training him to do it in an exact specific way that was measured to be as efficient as possible, then setting his pay structure so that he was paid a piece-rate. Want to make enough money to pay the rent, gotta haul more iron. SHOVEL FASTER!\n\nSound familiar? To any call center worker, it should. The stop-watches haven't gone away, they're now integrated with the computer and phone networks at call centers. Now they're used to create metrics like ACW time and AHT. Oh, and they write scripts for you, to micromanage every microsecond you spend on the phones talking to angry people. And they've got metrics that decide how much you're paid. Maybe you're in sales and working on commission, or you're in retention and have targets that get you bonuses (usually insanely high, and very difficult to achieve.) Even if you're \"not in sales\", you get harped on to do upsells on every call, get written up if you don't, and get promised mythical bonuses if you achieve some sky-high metric that some suit cooked up.\n\nAnd while call center work isn't physically dangerous like working in a steel mill in 1920, it is psychologically harmful. Let's face it, talking to angry people sucks. Some of the people on the phones are OK, some are unpleasant, some are downright abusive. Sure, you try to go \"Sticks and stones\", but the fact is that being verbally abused repeatedly leaves psychological wounds. Case in point: In the call center where I work, I started with a training class of twelve, just three weeks ago. There are now four left. Some bailed out during training, and more quit after a day, or a few days on the phones with live assholes. And I'm about to go batshit insane myself.\n\nBEEP-BEEP. \"ThankyouforcallingFooBarIncmynameisMeldrochowcanIhelpyou?\"\nTalk to another asshole. Finish call, the instant it disconnects...\n\nBEEP-BEEP. \"ThankyouforcallingFooBarIncmynameisMeldrochowcanIhelpyou?\"\nTalk to another asshole. Put the phone in ACW, to finish the call notes and bureaucratic crap that goes with every call...\n\n...and half-way through finishing the notes, BEEP-BEEP, because the damned supervisor put my phone back on Available from her desk, in supplication to the Almighty Metric.\n(nearly has a stroke suppressing the urge to shout things that would make a Marine blanche...)\n\"ThankyouforcallingFooBarIncmynameisMeldrochowcanIhelpyou?\"\n\nVirtually every modern-day call center is managed according to techniques derived from Taylorism.\n\nOf course, we already know the downside of Taylorism - nobody likes being micromanaged and pressured to work like a raped ape. Steel mill workers back in the day were driven batshit, and did things like forming unions and going on strike.\n\nCall centers today are almost as bad - everyone hates the goddamned phones, turnover is through the roof, most people can't stand not only talking to angry people, but the harping from the sups over meeting metrics, following stupid scripts, and still having to sound like you're having an orgasmically good time speaking with those wonderful customers.\n\nStill looking for the mythical Real Job. Until I get one, I get to talk to angry people while being managed in accordance with the principles of Taylorism. Kill me now.\n",

It was indeed slightly strange because it was a corporate emailaddress.\n\nBW: Well, one day I was staying in a hotel on corporate business, as was my boss.\nMe: uhuh.\nBW: She needed me for something and came into my room but I was NAKED!\nMe: Had to keep myself from snorting. *Politely chuckles* Oh dear\nBW: She took one look at me and walked out again. That's when she made me this email address and I'm not allowed to change it.\n\nI find his story very hard to believe and think he was really trying to show off. It was funny though!\n\nIf I went in the wrong with the part of the email address I provided, please tell me so I can edit. I mean no harm :)\n\nEDIT: No idea what's going on with my spacing. It looked fine when I posted it and when I click edit it looks fine again but... I must be doing something wrong!",

Additionally, there's some basic setup they need to do to use it (enabling and disabling account passwords and whatnot). \n\nEvery time I help a customer buy the service, I tell them \"okay, you are all set up, you will have [service] for [duration]. You'll need to restart your device to enable it. Also, you will want to go to [screen] to set it up.\" Inevitably, without fail, the customer says \"okay so i am all set up and I don't need to do anything, right?\", or maybe asks about the setup and ignores that they need to restart their device, and I have to catch them and repeat (sometimes multiple times) that they need to restart. I wonder if I'm saying too much at once sometimes but... *sobs internally*",

        "text": "I used to work in a Vacation Sales position. One of my favorite moments was when the Bank would call with a customer sitting in the manager's glass office to challenge a charge that they definitely did ***not*** authorize.\n\nNot being a normal phone-agent (I was the manager, so these were passed to me), I wasn't in the bad mood, so I gathered the necessary details and full complaint including hearing the client in the background (often a full family with lots of voices) all trying to explain that it's impossible that this charge was authorized. They would never have done this sort of thing.\n\nBefore refuting, I always tried to gather the seeds for later implantation. \"Do you have any idea how we got your debit card number? We can't just make up a 16 digit number ...?\" \"Well, I sure didn't give it to you! You must have had it already.\" That sort of thing.\n\nThe bank officer, if you remain calm during all of this, is always quite helpful (everyone except the customer stays friendly and nobody gets a chargeback until all the facts are in).\n\nThen I would unleash the \"Would you like to hear a recording of the person sitting next to you both authorizing the recording be made and the full details of the charge, including, of course, the full debit card number?\" I of course asked this question when the Bank Manager was the person holding the phone to be sure we did not get ... cut off.\n\nAfter the recording, which was always clearly one of the same voices in the room with the bank manager, there was usually a moment of silence. I always broke the silence with \"will that be all then? Would you like to have a private conversation with our mutual client and call back with any further questions?\"\n\nStrange thing is that we were not the \"normal\" vacation sales. If they had, in fact, called to cancel within a reasonable period of time, we would have likely refunded them. No need for Drama or Lies. But an attempted chargeback automagically disqualifies this \"exception\" policy.\n\nI mean: Everyone working at our call center had been short on cash at one point or another (many of us quite often in fact, LOL). But going in to the bank and trying to explain that the negative balance was NOT your fault when in fact it WAS your fault, that's not going to work if you \"decide\" you didn't buy something you actually did buy. I'd have paid good money to hear the rest of some of those conversations, though.\n\nI never did figure out how someone could record a (5 full minute) sale verification and then either forget about it or think it would somehow not matter.",

Anywhos, like all of you I also suffer the endless droll of stupidly we're forced to ensure day in, day out. This woman though, she was the epitome of stupid cunt. The one who refutes logic, who believes that YOU personally are to blame for something you physically cannot help. For reference: \n\nSC - stupid cunt \nMe - me \n\nSC \"Hello. One of your drivers caused me to have an accident tonight and she gave me your details so I can claim against her\" \n\nMe \"OK, do you have our drivers registration?\" \n\n*take, open claim file, validate policy* \n\nSC continues to explain that our driver caused her to swerve to avoid hitting them and as a result ran in to a parked vehicle. For anybody who doesn't work in vehicle insurance the general rule is if there wasn't a collision between her vehicle and ours, it's none of our concern. We take claims for an insurance broker, so we have pretty much fuck all to do with the policy aside from filling out a claim form, the underwriters deal with everything. These things combined means that we have literally no obligation to take this claim and besides that it isn't possible on our system due to how claim forms work. \n\nI tried to explain this in a polite way and suggested she speak to her own insurers and then they can contact us. But no, obviously I who has been doing this for a year is either stupid or lying. \n\nSC \"No no no...that's not right, my insurers told me you'd try to wriggle out of this, you ARE taking this claims *more ranting about what I will do*\" \n\nMe \"Madam I understand this is frustrating and unfair that you would have to claim on your own policy but when it comes to insurance if you swerve to avoid a collision and then crash in to someone else's car but didn't collide with our driver, the responsibility would be with you as it was you who took the evasive action. *apologise more and offer alternative suggestions*\" \n\nSC repeats for about 10 minutes over and over why I'm wrong and telling me I WILL DO THIS NOW I've basically lost any fucks I had and just offer to get a manager. She speaks to manager, he says the same thing, she accepts it after much complaining. \n\nThis is something that really bothers me, I might not be an expert at what I do but I fucking know more than half of the fuckwits I speak to on a daily basis, and to have my intellect be insulted by some cunt who thought that making a three fucking lane change at 90mph on a motorway, causing a multi car pileup isn't their fault because (and this is a quote) \"Well they were in the fast lane and they weren't driving fast enough! That isn't my fault!\"...it just kills me a bit inside. ",

It's been a very long time since I posted anything so please forgive any formatting issues. \n\nI work for an insurance company dealing with aggressive customers of all varieties. One of my last calls today is driving me absolutely insane thinking about how pathetic people can be. \n\nOne of our customers wrote off their car in an accident, as happens sometimes, and wants us to replace it. So far so good right? Except this particular customer has some mental issues and far too much time on their hands. In the 3 weeks since their accident they have called no less than 20 times. Each call is 25 minutes minimum with cuntstomer screaming about how terrible we are, how the loss adjuster accused them of being a criminal, about how we are ruining their lives and how we need to bow to their will. Which brings us to today. \n\nMe: welcome to &lt;company&gt; what can I do for you\n\nCuntstomer: what do you want?\n\nM: I'm not sure, how can I help you?\n\nC: *heavy sigh* what. Do. You. Want?\n\nM: I'm sorry? You've called &lt;company&gt; what can I do for you?\n\nC: tell me what's happening!\n\nM: do you have a reference number?\n\nThis goes on for a while, every time I ask what they need I'm met with a wall of anger. Finally we find the reference and I start to read the, frankly, overly complicated file (side note: the last person that handled this file makes terrible useless notes and wasn't in today to ask what these notes mean)\n\nM: I just need to place you on hold for a few minutes to see what's happening\n\nC: don't you dare. Just tell me I can get my car tomorrow \n\nM: unfortunately I will need to read the file before I can confirm anything\n\nC: *screaming* I don't want your excuses. Do as I say right now\n\nM: I'm sorry but I need to know what is happening before we can discuss this\n\nC: *incomprehensible screaming*\n\nM: I'm placing you on hold\n\nI read through everything and find that we just received the required information and, sadly, we can't replace the car since it's no longer made. Something we have requested written confirmation from the manufacturer to confirm before we pass on the bad news. Y'know cross the ts and dot the is\n\nM: thank you for holding. It looks like we're waiting on the manufacturer to provide further information\n\nC: what's a 3 letter word \n\nM: excuse me?\n\nC: a 3 letter word. Starts with L. Ends in E. it's lie! You're lying.  I was there when they sent you the information. You're a liar. \n\nM: I'm sorry but we do not have the required information \n\nC: you're lying! I'm going to take you to court. I'm going to have your job! I hope you enjoy being unemployed! Now tell me that I can pick up my car tomorrow \n\nM: as I've mentioned we need more information and your car will not be collected tomorrow\n\nC: stop lying! I know you have it. I. Watched. Him. Send. It. Either stop lying or I'm going all the way to the top. I'll make sure you're out on the street\n\nM: I'm going to have to ask you to stop so we can discuss your claim\n\nC: there's nothing to discuss. Unless the next words you have to say are I can collect my car I'm getting you fired. \n\nM: again, you cannot coll-\n\nC: get me a manager \n\nM: as you have called outside normal hours I will need to have them call you back. This will be tomorrow \n\nC: I demand they call me in 10 minutes\n\nM: I can pass on this request. However it will not be today\n\nC: you don't understand. That wasn't a request. It was a demand. Do you understand a demand\n\nM: I will pass on your request. You will receive a call tomorrow\n\nAt this point another manager walked by and I flagged them down. \n\nC: I will get you all fired if I don't receive a call in 10 minutes. \n\n*manager takes my phone*\n\nManager: you have been told you will get a call tomorrow. That is it. Goodbye *hangs up*\n\nThis was a summarised conversation that took place over 45 minutes. After the call they called again, my desk buddy happened to get the call and saw I was making notes\n\nDesk buddy: you will receive a call tomorrow. Stop calling\n\nI'm not worried about my job, everyone is aware of this cuntstomer. It just baffles me that anyone would be so angry as to actively try and get people fired just because they can't get their way. On top of this the next person was lovely who had to wait 45 minutes because this child can't take no for an answer. I'm not exaggerating either, it was a 45 minute hold time. \n\nWhat's even more frustrating that we usually spend maybe 35 minutes of actual work on files from start to finish and this one has taken literal hours from other files and despite that awesome manager my manager won't take this file because the cuntstomer hasn't specifically asked for it\n\nTl;Dr - I'm a wizard who can materialise a car on a whim",

Even then we can grant extensions in some scenarios for them to get even more time to pay it.

Now we can break up that deposit into installments over the next 3 months and grant you an extension for this month. But as long as you have that deposit on your bill we will not grant you that extension.\n\nCX: What deposit? My Final Notice/Customer Bill says I am not gonna be charged a deposit unless I'm disconnected.\n\nMe: All our final notices say that, but that's not your actual bill. Do you have the bill that went on Sept 21? The second page would have explained why you were charged a deposit.\n\nCX: you can't charge me a deposit! Only if I'm disconnected.\n\nMe: No, we can change you based on your payment history as well.\n\nCX: you're just charging it to cover for the storm!!\n\nMe: Do you have that bill?\n(Come to find out she's still registered for ebill so she didn't get paper bills in the mail just the final notice. I politely try to explain to her 3 or 4 times that the bill she has is not her actual bill but a final notice to reflect she's a month behind. Unfortunately web support team had been closed otherwise I'd call them to delete the registration so that I can show her the actual bill buuuuut)\n\nMe: CX, we would not be able to charge you an additional deposit simply due to the storm, it's only used to secure your account in case you decided to leave the property with a balance. Plus this was sent out in September, 3 weeks before the storm.\n\nCX: I'm gonna call back and speak to someone else because I don't know what or where you're getting your information from but it's wrong. \n\n\nClick.\n\nThat has been my story this week.",

        "text": "I work for a relatively large insurance company as a resolution case manager, which is just our fancy-sounding title for supervisor/tech support. Usually, I'll get a couple of escalations a day; most of them are relatively short and civil because the member just wants to hear the same thing the CSR told him but from someone with \"authority\", but there are the occasional ones that end up being long and/or very...loud.   \nAnd then there was the one that took the cake today...She started out very calm and polite (although she spoke with an upward inflection, which was absolutely irritating), but as soon as I told her I couldn't override standard procedure and write her a free-hand confirmation e-mail regarding something we weren't even involved in, things went south...\n\n\n**Me**: Hello [AngryLady], my name is astrokitty13, resolution case manager, how are you?\n  \n\n**AL**: Good. *(I can already tell it's gonna take a while...)*\n\n**Me**: Excellent, so I understand you hade an issue you wanted adressed, so let me see if I understand what's going on...\n \n\nAt this point, I basically just read back to her the notes I took while the agent explained to me why she was escalating. She was told by her HR that she was denied a certain accomodation at work, and it was denied by her insurance (which was false, because that particular request didn't go through us to begin with), so she now wanted us to write her \"just a quick e-mail\" to tell her we had nothing to do with it. I tried to calmly explain to her that I couldn't do that, because there is nothing in the file regarding that type of accomodation being possible, that we can't confirm we don't cover something that isn't even handled on our level or by our company, to go back and speak to her HR again, etc. And then she cut me off...\n\n**AL**: Excuse me? No...and I don't mean to cut you off, but I'm not gonna do that, you have to understand, I am part of the LITTLE GUYS, the LITTLE PEOPLE, fighting alone against corporations like YOU, and THEM, and I just want some HELP, but I can't get it cause I'm just one person... *(at this point I genuinely tuned out for a bit, partly because ADHD, partly because I knew where this was going)*... SO WHY DON'T YOU OPEN YOUR LITTLE E-MAIL PROGRAM AND WRITE ME THE QUICK E-MAIL SO I CAN TAKE IT TO MY HR? \n\n**Me** : While I understand and empathize with your situation, you have to understand that I cannot confirm or deny coverage for something we're not...\n\n\n**AR** : YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING, YOU'RE JUST WASTING MY TIME, besides, i told the other agent I wanted to talk to a MANAGER and not whatever resolution supervisor you are. I work in customer service, I know how this works.   \n\n**Me** : Ma'am, I am a Resolution Case Manager, and...\n\n**AR** : YEAH WHATEVER! I WANNA SPEAK TO WHATEVER MANAGER ABOVE YOU CAN DO THIS FOR ME!\n\n**Me** : I would be glad to refer your file to a manager, they will call you back within 24-48 business hours, if I may just have your contact information?\n\n**AR** : [gives contact info] So what's the manager's name and phone number, the one that'll call me back?\n\n**Me** : I cannot confirm that, as it is a team of managers and it will depend on which one gets assigned your file.  \n\n**AR** : So...you don't have like...one direct manager...fu-nny! I work in customer service, you know, so I know how it works, but...what-e-ver! *click*  \n\nI kept the file number aside so I can see where this goes...and I already feel bad for the poor soul who's going to have to call her back...",

More or less, it's a case of the people calling in going to the wrong site or typing in the wrong info. Well, today I get this business owner who has called before for the same issue: she's not able to get in. Well, I can understand that, so I try to help out as much as I can.\n\nFrom the time she calls in, I can tell she's going to be a complete bitch, as her tone is all snippy. I try my best to calm her down, and even give her a temp password so that she can change her password and get on from there.\n\nNow, this works for most people, once they type in that temp password and create a new one, they are able to log on from there. But this bitch wasn't having it.\n\n\"It keeps saying the password is incorrect.\"\n\nMe: \"Close out of the window you're in, go back to &lt;site&gt; in a new window, then type in user ID and password.\"\n\nHer: \"It's not taking it.\"\n\nMe: \"Did you close out of the window and go back into another one and go back to &lt;site&gt;?\"\n\nHer: \"Yes.\"\n\nNow, I'm honestly puzzled at this point. I decide to refer back to our floor chat and ask for solutions. One person suggests having them clear their cookies and try a different browser.\n\nMe: \"Which browser are you using?\"\n\nHer: \"Firefox.\"\n\nNow, Firefox works well (off and on) with our site but we advise Chrome or IE because they just, well, work better.\n\nMe: \"Are you able to try IE or Chrome?\"\n\nHer: \"I don't see what the browser has to do with this.\"\n\nI proceed, painfully, to explain why it may.\n\nHer: \"It's still not taking the temp password.\"\n\nMe: \"Are you using IE?\"\n\nHer: \"Yes.\"\n\nRinse, wash, repeat whole bloody process again.\n\nFinally it comes to a head, where I end up resetting her password (technically, we're not allowed to, but the call is well over ten minutes at this point so whatevs). It goes through without a hitch, and so I have her try to log in again.\n\nHer: \"It's telling me to create a new password.\"\n\nIn the end, I end up opening a IT ticket because she is just as obstinate and rude, against my better judgment.\n\nThe next call I get is another eservice one, the business owner has the same issue as the previous one, but this call goes over much smoother and she's able to get on.\n\nBS: \"Thanks so much! I was able to get on!\"",

        "text": "Hello folks, this is a story from a brief period a few years ago when I worked for a terrible terrible train company`s outsourced call centre in the south of England (GUESS WHICH ONE). With the call centre being outsourced, our access to their systems or even their station staff was limited and complicated which made it all the more painful when people were upset about issues and had to be told that it takes a solid MONTH usually to get the train company to do anything. Ill be ME, customer will be SL for Shouting Lady.\n\n\n* ME: *Thank you for calling Shitty Railway, youre through to Mr_Hallsworth, how can I help*\n* SL: *I want my money back right F***NG now!!!*\n* ME: *Ok madame, I understand, please explain what happened and Ill try my best to help.*\n* SL: *I was in one of your f**ng stations in [Bumf*ck South Country] trying to buy a stupid ticket from your stupid machine and it swallowed my £5 note without printing a ticket!!!! I want my money now, Im not buying another!!!!!!!*\n\nHere, I feel I need to explain how we handled these calls. Trying to validate this persons story and refund the money to her would take around 4 weeks at the very least. Since the station she was calling from was an unmanned one as well (no staff, just ticket machines and a waiting room), we cant contact anybody onsite. We`d need to email the regional manager who needs to get a company engineer to physically visit the station, run an audit on the machine, find out if the lady was telling the truth and then let the regional manager know. This whole process can take easily 3 weeks with the engineers being overbooked and then the manager needs to get finance to credit £5 to customers account or send a cheque which takes another week roughly. We are talking a good couple hours of work here to figure out if we owe someone a fiver. The call centres solution to this was that if someone calls regarding a relatively small amount having been swallowed by a machine, we should just send them a rail voucher for the same amount or maybe slightly more to their address. Its infinitely faster and more cost effective. So I tried...\n\n\n* ME: *Im so sorry Miss SL, It happens sometimes unfortunately. There isn't really anything I can do right now regarding the machine but you can purchase a ticket from the conductor onboard if you explain what happened and if you give me your address, what Ill do is Ill send you a rail voucher for £10 which you can use anytime in the next 12 months on any rail service in the UK.*\n* SL: *Are you fucking kidding me, I don't want your cunting voucher, I want my money back right now right here!!!!!!*\n\n\nThis went on for a solid 10 or so minutes and by the end, I just had to put a refund request through to the regional manager. The lady got a £5 cheque over a month later and then called to complain about that even though I repeatedly explain the timescale to her. I get it, it sucks to get your money swallowed by one of our faulty machines but being an angry idiot will not help.",

I see &lt;username&gt; has 6 bad password attempts, did you suggest a reset?\n\n**Me:** Yup, she refused outright. Claims there's multiple people impacted\n\n**OCT:** Well that's strange, only &lt;username&gt; has attempted to login within the last hour. Who the hell is trying to use &lt;SYSTEM&gt; at this time anyway! Do you have a contact number for &lt;username&gt;?\n\n**Me:** Sure, it's &lt;telephone number&gt;\n\n**OCT:** Leave it with me. Have a good shift! *click*\n\n**Few days later I needed to call &lt;OCT&gt; for something unrelated and decided to ask what happened**\n\n**Me:** By the way OCT, whatever happened to &lt;username&gt; reporting &lt;SYSTEM&gt; down a few days ago?\n\n**OCT:** I called her and told her that her password was bad. She ran her mouth and I terminated the call. Turns out she was on her own and fabricated the whole 10 other people story. No idea why she lied about something like this, but HR have taken it pretty seriously - all I know is she has a disciplinary meeting scheduled.\n\n**Me:** Well, couldn't happen to a more charming person!\n\n**OCT:** Agreed\n\nNot sure what the outcome of &lt;callers&gt; disciplinary was but I'm really hoping she was put in her place.\n",

I'm working on a story about a large telecommunications company that is starting to implement messaging into their customer service platform. Instead of making calls, they're having customer service representatives chat with people through the company's app. \n\nOne of the aspects of this new technology I'm most interested in exploring is how this affects the people who work in call centers. Do any of you have any thoughts about this? Do you think that chatting with customers through an app would make your life easier? Harder? Do you think it would be better than just talking on the phone? \n\nThanks so much. ",

        "text": "I know I know they're just doing their job and often times it isn't easy. The reason why I don't like them is because of their poor attitudes. I work for the \"Better\" US wireless carrier. All of the supervisors in my call center are pompous assholes. They act like their leadership reflects how surveys and other metrics turn out when it really doesn't.\n\n I speak to approximately 30 customers a day and tend to get 1 or 2 surveys each day. For the most part I can process customers and they're happy because they call in for a simple answer or an easy solution and I'm an overly friendly guy. I tend to have 5 customers a day who want an account credit or warranty phone which they aren't entitled to. No amount of politeness, connecting or following the script is going to make them happy, unless I bend the rules and give them something that they aren't supposed to have. The company provided resolution will determine the survey result not me. It's definitely not my useless supervisor who acts like she's afraid to talk to customers that caused a good survey.\n\nAnother issue that I have with supervisors is that they act like they're afraid to talk to customers. I understand that their job is administrative and they don't need to talk to every customer, but there are occasions when they need to talk to a customer. Whenever the escalation queue is closed or has a hold time longer than 5 minutes they are required to talk to a customer. But every supervisor acts like the world has come to an end when they have to have direct contact with the public. Here's why that pisses me off. \n\n* The call is going to be taken on a cell phone so it's not being recorded\n* There will not be a survey\n* This will be the only customer that they've had to talk to all week long\n* They don't have a script to follow\n\nWhen my team is told in a morning huddle \"have fun today\" it makes my blood boil. If you refuse to talk to a customer what makes you think I'm going to enjoy 8 hours of dealing with them? Also, supervisors can get up take a bathroom break or go goof off with other supervisors whenever they want to. I on the other hand am fussed at for using a full 60 seconds of ACW or placing a customer on hold for a required transfer. No I won't enjoy myself today or any other day at work.\n\n/rant",

Lady on the phone who is angry that her broadband isn't working, and apparently she was told that it had yet to go live (it had been working for years). Since she isn't verified, I decide to take the call so I can verify her and hopefully get a proper solution.\n\nWell. As soon as the call comes through, I am subjected to a solid minute at least of ranting about how this is unacceptable and she needs her home broadband to run her business. It seems this lady has been abroad for the last month on business and while overseas, she occasionally heard that her home phone wasn't working, but she brushed it off, assuming it must have been the odd momentary glitch. Nope, something has gone badly wrong, but since I'm in CS&amp;B, I can't see what it might be. All I can discern is that the payments are all up to date.\n\nThe lady wasn't wrong - you pay for a service, it isn't provided, by all means get angry. What makes this story worthy of this sub was a small exchange. Angry lady proclaims that she is in the process of obtaining a 'billboard' (I think she meant a sandwich board), on which she was going to write imprecations against my company and then march around London to let everyone know how terrible we are.\n\nSetting aside the fact that London is gigantic, if you run the kind of business that requires you to make regular month-long trips abroad, do you really have time to walk the streets with a sandwich board?",

        "text": "As some of you will already know, I work an out of hours service desk - we cover multiple businesses. Some of these business do not give us any access to their systems to perform actions for their users (such as password resets), instead just give us access to server monitoring/application monitoring tools so we can act on outages - in these cases callers receive a message saying to hang up unless they're calling to report a critical systems failure.\n\nThis gem originated from one of these businesses;\n\nI'd like to preface this by saying that &lt;caller&gt; had a particularly bad attitude from the start of the call. \n\n**Me:** IT emergency line\n\n**Caller:** Oh yes, reset my password now please, my username is &lt;username&gt;\n\n**Me:** Have you tried a self service reset?\n\n**Caller:** NO! Why would I? I'm calling you so just reset my password!\n\n**Me:** You've called an emergency line for reporting systems failure. I'm afraid we do not deal with password resets as per the voice prompt before the call. This is why I'm suggesting you use the self service system, because there's no alternative right now.\n\n**Caller:** But I've called before and had my password reset!\n\n**Me:** Yes, during business hours you can have your password reset. Out of hours, this is an IT emergency line only.\n\n**Caller:** Are you refusing to reset my password?\n\n**Me:** I literally have no way *to* reset your password\n\n**Caller:** SO WHAT I AM SUPPOSED TO DO EXACTLY?\n\n**Me:** Use the self service system?\n\n**Caller:** I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS!\n\n**Me:** Respectfully, in the time we've spent so far arguing about this, you could have already reset your password and gained access to your account. I'm sorry, but as I've already mentioned, this line is for reporting IT emergencies, this is not an emergency and as such I'm going to terminate the call. Do you need the address to the self service system before we end?\n\n**Caller:** EXCUSE ME!\n\n**Me:** Yes?\n\n**Caller:** SO WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU HAVE A SYSTEM FAILURE?\n\n**Me:** Depending on the nature of the failure it's escalated to one of several on call IT managers\n\n**Caller:** EXCUSE ME! WHY CAN'T YOU DO THAT TO RESET MY PASSWORD?\n\n**Me:** Because resetting your password isn't an IT emergency and also, as I've already mentioned you can actually do this yourself via the self service system\n\n**Caller:** EXCUSE ME! Don't you think I'm important enough?\n\n**Me:** It's not a case of important or not - it simply isn't an IT emergency\n\n**Caller:** HOW DARE YOU I HAVE VERY IMPORTANT WORK THAT I NEED TO DO URGENTLY. HOW DARE YOU PREVENT ME FROM WORKING AND NOT OFFER ME A SOLUTION! \n\n**Me:** A solution has been provided, use the self service system at &lt;url&gt;. I'm now going to terminate this call\n\n**Caller:** WAIT MY MANAGER WILL BE HEARING ABOUT THIS AND YOU WASTING ME TIME\n\n**Me:** Sir your manager will be hearing about this regardless I can assure you of that and I'm sorry, but if anything you're wasting your own time as a perfectly reasonable solution has been offered, goodbye.\n\n**Caller:** EXCUSE ME!\n\n**Me**: *click*\n\nFor the record folks &lt;callers&gt; management received a lovely follow-up email regarding 'educating' &lt;caller&gt; on correct procedures around password resets and use of the emergency line.\n\n**P.S.

From the days of GAIT dual-band phones through the wonders of the Motorola V3 Razr, even the Sony Ericsson Walkman phone.\n\nSo I'm newly-minted manglement working the night shift with my team of noobs, and one of them comes to me with an escalation.  A gentleman is less than pleased with his bill.  Seeing as it's over $10k for a month and a half of usage, I can certainly understand why.  \"Send him to me.\"\n\nThe gentleman had recently acquired a PDA phone from us, the model of which escapes me.  And he's happy with the device.  He's set it up to check his e-mail for him, which it dutifully does every ten minutes.\n\nNow, all of these data-hungry (as hungry as you can get circa 2007) have a nice, unlimited data plan that we're supposed to go along with these devices.  ~$40 a month will cover all of the data transfer for e-mail, browsing, etc.  However, his account was not set up with this handy plan.  Instead, his plan was left on data Pay-Per-Use, $0.03/kb.\n\nIf his phone found no e-mail, a mere ping on the server racked about 9-10kb.  Every. Ten. Minutes.  For a month and a half before the cycle closed.  To say nothing of those times when an e-mail was located.\n\nI acknowledge the issue, work with him to get the plan corrected, and advise him that we will get the bill corrected.  However, this might take a while, as it has to go up the chain due to the amounts involved.\n\nAt Orange, we had a nice knowledge portal.  You could see the Schedule of Authorization (read: refund limits) of every level in the company, up to and including how much CEO Stan could do before he had to take it to the board.  And this issue was punching WAY above my weight.  As a lowly mangler, I had about $400 I could handle on my own.\n\nSo, I submitted the case, requesting that the rerate be performed.  It went past my Area Manager, past the Director, past the Regional Vice President, in charge of our five-state coverage area, to his boss, the VP of Customer Service at the national level.  0.0  Nothing like that pucker factor to make sure you've got every 'i' dotted and every 't' crossed.\n\nAfter about a week, it came back down, rerated and credited for all the PPU charges, stamped with his approval.  &gt;Whew!&lt;\n\nTL;DR - New manager asked corporate overlords for &gt;$10k for a customer, get a Yes.",

I'm pretty much burned out from doing the same thing and hearing the same questions and complaints day in and day out. And to make matters worse, there is nowhere to really go in my company due to the low turnover in other departments. So I am stuck for the foreseeable future.\n\nBefore the call center, I worked in retail. I was a pharmacy technician at a CVS. And I had almost finished all the training when I got hired. Granted, the pay was low and I dealt with a couple rough customers, but for the most part I was liking it. The store I worked at was busy so there was pretty much always something to be done. I like being busy. Staring into space or looking at my phone between calls is getting boring, and I have the weight gain and the feeling of exhaustion to show for it. Plus, in the pharmacy, I knew I was in an in-demand field and at least I could pretend I was helping people. (I loved some of my senior citizen customers...I remembered seeing some months ago that one had died and I felt sad; she really was a great lady.) Granted I could've never gone through pharmacy school, but that's not much of the point.\n\nI feel like I can't quit my job because of the pay. But believe me, I thought about going back to CVS pharmacy and taking the training classes again. If it weren't for the blah pay and lack of benefits, I'd go back to my old store and see if they needed help. And I even found an MS program that I'd like to do while I work there and reinvent myself. \n\nDoes anyone else want to get out and feel it's out of reach?",

Oh and it took 2-3 supervisors to change my schedule to give me a 10 hour rest period between some of my shifts.\n\nMy body just came back from being on leave last week. I'm not sure how much longer I can function like this every grueling day and not request to go back on leave in hopes of some sanity. All vacation was denied and I just can't. I need a means to sleep more than 6 hours a stint. Dear customers stop yelling at us, you do realize we had one of the top 10 worst storms in outage comparison ever in our companies history and we understand you're frustrated but can you chill? \n\nAlso facebook sharing has become a nightmare for customer service as people are asking for things they may not qualify for at all. Pretty sure about 40 calls of the 90 I took half way through my shift was simply for a facebook post. BAH HUMBUG. \n\n/end rant",

        "text": "Background: As of 1 October, I am now Manager Man at my place of employment. I work for a points-based rewards program that works with multiple businesses. where points can be redeemed for store credit but never actual cash.\n\nWe were running a promotion that any order with business A, no matter how small, would earn $10 in credit for business B. Business A is a parts dealership (anything from appliances and office machines to automotive) with a very strict no returns policy. Business B is a big box retailer (similar to, but not Rollback City).\n\nThe offer was only meant to award once per account but, due to a glitch in our system, it was firing on every single order for a while until corporate caught the mistake and reprogrammed it. Although our T&amp;Cs state that we could have removed the points that over-awarded, we didn't; we just weren't honoring orders after the correction was in place if the person had already received points from the offer at least once.\n\nCaller Guy had already racked up over $600 in credit for business B and spent it on their website. He was expecting another $900 or so in credit. His total out-of-pocket spending at business A was only about $175. \n\nHis call went a little something like this. MM = Me, Manager Man; CG = Caller Guy.\n\n&gt;MM: I'm sorry, sir, but the offer was only intended to trigger once per person. You are welcome to keep all the points that were earned in error, however I cannot award for an offer with a once-per-person limit that you have already received.\n\n&gt;CG: This is unacceptable, what am I supposed to do with $900 worth of spark plugs from business A?\n\nI hadn't actually looked up any of his orders yet for verification, I was still under the impression that he had actually ordered $900 worth of spark plugs and thereby even more than that in credit for business B.\n\n&gt;MM: I understand that you are upset, but I'm afraid my hands are tied in this matter. Since the offer was only valid online and the orders in question were just placed earlier today, you could try contacting business A and cancelling your orders. I'd be happy to look up their number and transfer you directly to them.\n\n&gt;CG: I can't cancel the orders. I already picked them up.\n\n&gt;MM: It says here, the last order you placed was only minutes ago. If you are at their store now, why don't you talk to them about your situation and see if they can offer any kind of exception to their no return policy?\n\n&gt;CG: I've been doing that for the last hour. They won't do it.\n\nTurns out the guy had sat all day yesterday and for several hours today sitting on his phone, placing a $1-2 order with business A and picking it up immediately and then placing a $10 order on business B's website. Rinse, repeat.\n\nAfter several more choruses of \n\n||: CG: I want my points | MM: I can't give you those points :||\n\nwe came to a coda of:\n\n&gt;CG: So, tell me then, what am I supposed to do with all these spark plugs?\n\n&gt;MM: Whatever you were planning to do with them even if you had gotten the store credit for business B. ... \n\n/launches into the QA mandated dialogue for \"I'm hanging up on you now.\"\n\nAs a 5-year front liner, it was very gratifying to finally have the authority to tell off a customer who was clearly scamming the system.\n\n**TL;DR:** Guy scams the system for $600 in credit and gets upset when it stops working. He then gets even more upset when he finds out he can't return a bunch of merchandise purchased in order to trigger the scam.\n\nEdit: Removed a sentence that I had apparently written twice and added a TLDR.",

        "text": "Back story, this was a 24 hour service, through a pretty large hospital system. People could call during the day to set appointments or whatever. But an important part of it was triage. Ex. Mom calls, her 3 old woke up with a cough and a rash. Do we go to ER?, do we make an appointment with the doc? Is it just a viral thing and take something OTC?\n\nWe had hundreds of flowsheets that could resolve 99.9% of issues and give advice on the best course of action.\n\nI worked at night, so I did the triage, but I was also on call for lots of Dr offices, if you called the office, it rolled to me. During the day it was a huge call center with hundreds of people, but at night, all by my lonesome. I covered something like 1000 doctors in a 100 mile radius. I had files for each with standing orders on how to serve their patients, and not wake the doctor.\n\nFirst good story: ( I covered  a lot of OBGYN's)\n\nLady called that she had vomiting and diarrhea, late in the pregnancy, not like morning sickness. I told her she had a stomach bug and would be fine, I had received lots of N/V/D calls that week. She asked, but if I have a stomach bug, doesn't that mean my baby has a stomach bug? No ma'am, that's not how it works. She continued, but I haven't eaten today, so my baby hasn't eaten either? No ma'am, that's not how that works either. \n\nThe same day, grandma calls me about her pregnant teenage granddaughter. Almost full term, says she went to the bathroom, and when she was done, realized the cord was hanging out, and wanted to know if that was normal?....no ma'am. Not even a little bit.\n\nYoung lady, early 20s, pregnant with baby #7, 42 weeks along, having 5 minute contractions, calls me while cooking dinner to ask if I thought she was in labor. Honey I think you should know better than I do. I'm a childless male.\n\nThen there's the guy with 2 different insulin injectors who calls every few weeks \"Well I F-ed up again\" now I gotta figure out how he screwed up and how to keep him conscious.\n\nI'll triage and suggest ER, or stay home, and they respond, well I'm already at the ER, I just thought I'd call while I'm waiting to see if I need to be here or not.\n\n2 am, Sunday, guy wants me to call his doctor for narcotics because he has a wound on his foot, wound has been there 3 months with 10/10 pain the whole time and NOW he wants to talk to the doc. He hasn't seen his doctor in 3+ years, and missed his appointment to evaluate for diabetes back then. (definitely a diabetic ulcer)\n\nFriday night. \"My daughter has a fever, been giving her meds but it just wont stay down\". How long has it been up? \"Since Tuesday\". Mk, how high? \"Oh its been 106.5 to 107.5\"....Seriously? \n\nThe then opposite end, people in the ER for 99.0. your kid probably didn't have an infection, but they probably do now.\n\nNew mom, called me every day because the kids cord was coming off and he'd get a drop of blood on the bandaid. We would have very long discussions about how this was normal, but shed call back then next day. I was so glad when it finally came off. \n\nGuy calls, says he's eating dinner with his elderly wife, and about 15 minutes ago she just got real quiet and dropped her fork, she's just been sitting their staring and drooling. She's either dead or had a stroke, so that one got a 911 referral.  \n\nOne kind of fun one was a guy calling while on a cross country road trip and forgot important meds. He was with CVS or Walgreens, somewhere nationwide, so I found an open pharmacy (middle of the night) that was a reasonable distance ahead along his course, called in refills, then gave him directions to that pharmacy so he could just swing in, get his meds, and be on his way. \n\nIt was a contract job, only did it for about 3 months, VERY interesting experience, but very rewarding. Granted I was being paid as an ER nurse, I couldn't do it for what I know a lot of call center workers get paid.",

        "text": "Yet another tale from the out of hours hell desk. If you've read my tales before - you may recall that these particular callers should not be calling in the first place as they're forbidden from holding meetings outside core business hours because we do not have techs on site to offer support when things go wrong - of course, these people still do regardless, then moan when they surprisingly can't get support.\n\n**Me:** Service Desk\n\n**Caller:** I need someone sending to &lt;room&gt; right now! I'm holding a meeting and the projector won't work\n\n*[note the instant attitude the caller is giving]*\n\n**Me:** Okay, can you please explain further, what exactly is happening?\n\n**Caller:** I don't have time, just send someone!\n\n**Me:** I'm sorry, there's nobody to send - it's 7 pm and out of hours now. Can you tell me what's going on and I maybe able to help?\n\n**Caller:** [proceeds to rant for 10 minutes about IT being \"unhelpful\" every time she calls]\n\n**Me:** mmkay, and so back to the projector, what's going on with that exactly?\n\n**Caller:** *sigh* it's saying \"no signal\". It's disgraceful you have nobody to help me with this. This room should have been checked in advance!\n\n**Me:** Did you pre-book this room?\n\n**Caller:** NO! It was free to use I don't need to \"book\" anything!\n\n**Me:** Well, actually, as per the information and guidelines for usage of these rooms, you do actually need to book them in advance if you're using them outside business hours to ensure that IT have a tech on standby in case anything goes wrong, and, not only that, holding meetings outside of core hours has to be authorised by management, have you authorised this with management?\n\n**Caller:** NO! ARE YOU GOING TO HELP ME OR NOT!\n\n**Me:** So the projector is saying \"no signal\", however there's a monitor on the presenters desk where I assume you're sitting - can you tell me if anythings appearing on there?\n\n**Caller:** WHAT'S A MONITOR!\n\n**Me:**.... it's the screen, the thing that looks like a TV screen?\n\n**Caller:** OH, THE TOUCHSCREEN!\n\n**Me:** No, it's not a touch... errr, yes that, the \"touch screen\"\n\n[note, this is a standard Dell monitor, not a touch screen]\n\n**Caller:** Okay, get on with it then! What about it?\n\n**Me:** Is it turned on? Can you see anything?\n\n**Caller:** No it's a blank screen and it has an amber light\n\n**Me:** Okay, so, in that case can you please look under the desk and locate the actual base unit for me?\n\n**Caller:** THE WHAT?\n\n**Me:** The main part of the computer? The CPU, tower, machine...\n\n**Caller:** OH the CD DRIVE?\n\n**Me:** Wha... Okay, sure the \"CD DRIVE\".\n\n**Caller:** OKAY I FOUND IT\n\n**Me:** Excellent, any lights or fan noises etc...?\n\n**Caller:** NOPE IT'S OBVIOUSLY BROKEN!\n\n**Me:** Can you see a power button?\n\n**Caller:** I think so shall I press it?\n\n**Me:** Yes, please do\n\n**Caller:** Oh something happened\n\n**Me:** Excellent\n\n**Caller:** It's saying starting windows\n\n**Me:** Great... and the projector?\n\n**Caller:** Oh yes, it's also showing the same thing, it's working!\n\n**Me:** Excellent, well thanks for call---\n\n**Caller:** HANG ON! I WANT TO RAISE A COMPLAINT ABOUT THIS\n\n**Me:** I'm sorry?\n\n**Caller:** I WANT TO COMPLAIN THIS WASN'T WORKING. WHY WASN'T THIS READY FOR ME?\n\n[caller said this with as much hate in her voice as if I'd peed on her mothers face]\n\n**Me:** I'm sorry but I can't raise a complaint for this. If you'd have followed procedure and booked the room then it would have been checked in advance for you - that aside, there's no actual issue with the room anyway, the computer simply wasn't switched on. I'm sorry but I can't raise a complaint for cases of user error when there's no actual IT fault.\n\n**Caller:** WELL I'LL SEE WHAT MY MANAGER HAS TO SAY ABOUT THIS! *click*\n\nNo thank you, no apology for being rude. Yeah, you do that lady, I look forward to having a nice long chat with your manager about  your blatant disregard for policy and rudeness.\n\n**P.S.
