That's just putting everything you'll need to make the dish in place before you start the cooking process. Take an omelette with home fries as an example. Someone comes in before service to crack all the eggs and whisk them, cut up all the vegetables and other accoutrements, and put them in little metal tins called hotel pans that get slotted into a table called a bain-marie which can hold the ingredients at any temperature you need to hold them, hot or cold. When an order comes in, you just grab what you need from the hotel pans rather than hunting for a pepper and cutting it up.\n\nThe second is the brigade system, you have stratified layers of responsibility. The person making the omelette isn't the person making the home fries unless it's a very small kitchen. The two people coordinate their cooking times so both aspects are ready at the same instant even if they take different times to cook.\n\nIn fine dining establishments this is taken to the classical extreme, one person cooks a steak, someone else prepares the sauce, a third person makes the mashed potatoes, and a fourth person cooks the vegetables, and everyone has everything they could possibly need in terms of ingredients or tools within 5 feet of their body at all times.\n\nIf you get really good at mise en place in your home cooking you'll find that your recipes don't take nearly as long to make from start to finish. That's why you always see pro chefs with little ramekins of perfectly portioned ingredients in cooking videos so they can just throw them in without really thinking too hard when the stove is lit. Do all the preparation and planning before you put heat to the pan so that once you do you can focus on the actual cooking.\n\nAs others mentioned also, restaurant grade equipment is just better. A restaurant quality stove puts an incredible amount of heat through your pan. The trade off however is that if you lose control of that heat for even a second you will burn what you're cooking. Most casual home cooks don't realize how narrow the window between cooking and burning is. The [Maillard Reaction](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maillard_reaction) which is responsible for the Golden-Brown Delicious flavor of fried foods and baked goods occurs most comfortably in a 15\u00b0C window. Under the window and you get pale, flaccid product that only dries out the longer you have it on the heat since the boiling point of water is lower than the lowest temperature required to start the reaction in earnest. Higher, and you'll start to caramelize, where the sugars have enough energy to react by themselves, and eventually undergo pyrolysis which is burning.\n\nAlso, cocaine elves.\n\nEdit: Lmao, I didn't realize what subreddit this was in. Updated answer, they run out and steal the food from other restaurants.","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1677768817.0},{"author":"YCKAGMD","text":"my guess is that they've already done the vast majority of food and cooking prep.

Restaurants have a pretty good idea of what volume of what items they will need, so they prep the ingredients for those items. This eliminates a lot of steps of those recipes, such as mincing garlic, dicing onions, etc. This goes for both fancy restaurants and not-fancy ones. For instance, prepping the batter for Perkins pancakes, according to a buddy who used to work there, takes 24 hours. But if you have prepped batter, then it's just a quick matter to cook some up.\n\nThe second is a division of duties. Recipes you read are generally designed for one person to work on. However, in mult-part recipes, one person can be working on one component while another is working on a different component. A large restaurant may have many line cooks with specific duties, while a chef will bring it all together at the end.","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1677701850.0},{"author":"inno7","text":"They put bigger batteries in their clicks, so time goes faster there.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1677730017.0},{"author":"Zero_Pumpkins","text":"They have special Time Machine ovens.

Since February is named after the goddess Februallia and her month was a time to make sacrifices and atone for sins they decided it should be the month which had 28 days in honor of those sacrifices and the original months. \n\nThe 'leap year' concept also came from that contest because each leaper got four tries. So the parliament decided to add a day to February once every four years in honor of the leaper who died representing Februallia. \n\nLast cool thing to know is that contest was what launched the competition games that we now know as the Olympics.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1674243908.0},{"author":"plugubius","text":"The Romans originally had ten lunar months and a stretch of time in winter when they didn't bother to mark what month it was at all.

They had the twelve priests in charge of declaring each month's calends, nones, and ides bid on behalf of their assinged month, but February's priest got out of bed late and missed the whole meeting.\n\nWhen he arrived late, he complained that Sextilis (the old name for August) now had 31 days, while his month still had just 28, and he asked if maybe someone couldn't find an extra day somewhere so he wouldn't look like such a complete slouch. The pontifex maximus responded, \"when pigs fly.\" So the embarassed priest jumped up and down, flapping his arms and squeeling like a pig. Everyone laughed so hard that they gave February an extra day that year.\n\nThe ritual was very humiliating, and obviously the priest in charge of the February calends, nones, and ides didn't do it every year. Some priests refused to do it at all, leaving decades-long stretches when February never had 29 days. By contrast, Saltus Longus Porcinus famously did it every year of his office (until he fell at Cannae).\n\nSo by the time of the 1st centurt BCE, the calendar was no longer aligned with the seasons. Thus, Julius Caesar (yes, that Julius Caesar) instituted the Julian calendar reforms. He said that the piggy leap year should occur every four years, no more, no less. And to make sure that the priests actually performed the (by then) ancient and sacred ceremony, he shortened its name to just \"leap year.\"\n\nInterestingly, the squeeling remained an essential feature of ritual even after it was taken over by the Christians in Rome until Oadacer deposed Romulus Agustus.

For example, if you were to describe that a tiger was orange, you would say \"orange tiger\", and not \"tiger orange\". The adjective \"orange\" comes before the noun \"tiger\".\n\nIn French, adjectives are usually put after the noun that's being described. So, if you were to describe that a tiger was orange (they say \"tigre\" for \"tiger\" in French - they get letters mixed up sometimes, just like the colours on their flag), you would \"tigre orange\", and not \"orange tigre\". The adjective \"orange\" comes after the noun \"tigre\".\n\nSo, back to your question. In English, we are describing the noun, \"box\", with the adjective \"spring\", to say that the box is full of springs. So, we would call it a \"spring-box\"! However, since it was originally a French word, the order of the adjective and noun are flipped!

The input we had before language isn't as good for creating memories- sight, smell, feel etc.  This is why some scents can bring back powerful memories of childhood, because they are connected to that pre-frontal cortex of actual sensory memory rather than this construct of language.  So while I believe I have some good memories as a baby, most of them are just feelings, sensations, or even smells.  I remember what cloth diapers felt like, because I liked them better, and I remember the shag carpet in the house I lived in before 2-3 years old.  I have also worked hard at remembering those things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's much easier to remember things when you have the structure of language in which to remember them.  Those are more concrete and easier to access, and get easier as our language skills develop.

Its meaning is often missed by many, so make sure  you pay attention. The wisdom contained within will reveal many mysteries to anyone clever enough to uncover it\n\nMany, many years ago, leagues and miles from this place, a boy was born with a golden screw in his belly button. This golden screw was a mystery to all as he grew up, most of all the boy himself. When he was young, he asked his father, \"why do I have a golden screw in my belly button?\" His father told him, \"I don't know. Go ask your mother.\" He asked his mother, \"why do I have a golden screw in my belly button?\" His mother answered, \"I don't know. Go ask your father.\" So there were no answers to be found there.\n\nWhen at last the boy had grown, he decided it was time to find the answer he had been searching for. He set out from his home and traveled the land, searching far and wide for the secret of his golden screw. He went to the most prestigious university in all the land, but none of the scholars there had ever heard of his problem, nor did they know what to do about it. He traveled to the greatest library in all the world, but not a single book there made mention of his affliction. He traveled from city to city, scouring every street, every tiny alleyway, every bar and tavern and dock for someone, anyone, who might know the answer to his belly button problem. But there were no answers to be found.\n\nFinally, after fifteen long years of searching, the boy came to the farthest corner of the world, where the stars themselves are anchored to the horizon. He had heard legend of an ancient wise man who lived here, one who could answer any question asked of him, if the asker had the determination and strength of will to climb his mighty tower. And there before the boy was the tallest tower he had ever seen. It scraped the very heavens in its might, and the shadow it cast ran five miles long. But he had come too far to turn back now, so he began to climb the tower.\n\nDay after day, step after step, even the earth itself fell behind him as he made his slow, painful trek to the top. It was only when he had cleared the two thousandth step, and passed the level of the clouds, that the top of the tower was in sight. Climbing his way up the final step, he stood before the wise man of legend. The wise man looked as ancient as the knowledge he curated, and his beard was nearly ten feet in length. The time had come. At last, the boy could learn the answer which he had long sought.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said the boy. The wise man put down the ancient tome which he had been studying and fixed his weary old eyes on this newcomer. \"I have a question to ask you, wise man, if you'll allow me.\" The wise man nodded, and gestured for him to speak. \"Wise man,\" the boy asked, hoping desperately to find an answer. \"Why is there a golden screw in my belly button?\" The wise man looked thoughtfully for a moment at the boy's curious screw, but he did not answer. Instead he turned, and from a corner behind a bookshelf he produced an ornate golden box. Turning back to the boy, he opened the box, and within lied the most beautiful golden screwdriver in the world. Its handle was carved in intricate detail, and the shaft was polished to a radiant shine. The wise man held the screwdriver and, pressing it to the screw in the boy's belly button. The boy watched as the screw was turned once, then twice, and then...\n\nHis ass fell off.","upvotes":27,"created_utc":1664554029.0},{"author":"woaily","text":"Sounds like your bell might be broken","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1664553301.0},{"author":"sentient_cyborg","text":"You have to push it in for it to work.

If a cat got under one of those new automobiles, who knows how much it would cost to fix the tires.\n\nLuckily, an engineer at Ford had the idea. He took a real small engine and installed in a cat. That way, the cat will both go faster and make noise so we wouldn\u2019t have to worry about stepping on them. It was so successful that he was able to train up a whole team who go around and perform the procedure on every cat they can find. They haven\u2019t gotten them all yet, but they\u2019re real close.\n\nThe only real hiccup is that the engine isn\u2019t on all the time. I think that was preserve the mileage or something. So now when we want the cat to make noise, we have to push really hard on it in the right spot to turn the engine on. Each cat is different though, so the spot it\u2019s different on each one.

In fact there are multiple accounts of the Varangian saving the lives of emperors.\n\n\nOne of the most famous stories is from 1018 AD when, the morning after a huge day of feasting, the captain of the Varangian Guard put down an armed rebellion single handedly. The rebels were so put off by his confident and even jovial demeanor when he crawled out of the city sewers to block the city gate, they retreated because they were certain it was a trap. The truth is, the Capitan was a pretty fun guy and was still intoxicated from eating mushrooms and drinking too much wine the day before. \n\n\nEmperor Basil II gave him a land, title, and multiple castles in Italy. The Varangian Capitan, his name roughly translates today to, Mike \u00d8nid became internationally famous and a historical tastemaker. Through mistranslations and retellings Mike \u00d8nid eventually became latinized to Mario, which inspired Nintendo's hit series starring Mario Mario and his brother Luigi.\n\n\nAnd so one man, Mike \u00d8nid, ending up changing Europe's perspective on mushrooms.

Once in the new world, the locals gave him chocolate in the hopes he would just go back and stop bothering them. Unfortunately for the Aztecs, he wasn\u2019t convinced, so Europeans kept returning, trying to find the landing site of the asteroid. Eventually, after many trips, and many deaths of both Europeans and Native Americans, the meteorite was discovered and brought back to Europe, and eventually made its way to Switzerland, the country that made the best chocolate in the world, where they discovered that, when combined with cocoa powder (that\u2019s what chocolate is made from), caramel and nougat, the minerals in the Martian meteorite would make the person who ate it smarter, funnier, and more attractive. The rock and metal that originated on Mars was brought to a secret lab in Germany that had designed a process that could grind it into a dust so fine that you can\u2019t taste the rocks. ThIs dust was then shipped to Switzerland, where it was made into candy bars.

CRT is one of them. A lot of people are trying to push a lot of different narratives about what CRT is. Some of them are misinformed and talking in good faith; some are intentionally muddying the waters. It\u2019s a complex issue!\n\nCRT looks into some of the more shameful elements of our history. The United States (and the world as a whole, but CRT is a particularly hot-button issue in the US right now) has enacted policies and laws that negatively impacted anyone who wasn\u2019t a white man. As time went by, we eliminated most of those laws, but economics is a complicated issue. \n\nImagine a game of Monopoly. You play a few rounds where one player isn\u2019t allowed to buy any properties. Then suddenly that player is allowed to buy properties. Is the game suddenly fair? Of course not! The system changed to eliminate the unfairness, but it didn\u2019t address the consequences of never letting that player buy property. \n\nLikewise, we had laws for decades that disenfranchised certain groups. Eliminating those laws was a good start, but it didn\u2019t undo the damage that had already happened. It put some people at a severe disadvantage relative to the people who weren\u2019t restricted beforehand. \n\nBut like I said\u2014 it\u2019s a difficult problem to address! Not every problem is caused solely by these old laws, not every law has been repealed, some people are just mean spirited and try to blame everyone and everything but themselves, and some unpleasant people are only unpleasant because this unfair system messed them up! \n\nSome people are trying to argue that disenfranchised groups should just do everything perfectly and live up to impossible standards to escape poverty and inequality. Some groups are even trying to ban the teaching of CRT because they feel persecuted by learning about history!\n\nAnd that\u2019s ultimately all that CRT is. It\u2019s an examination of history and our past mistakes and misdeeds. How can we improve? How can we avoid repeating these mistakes?

He did an amazing double act with Bingo - one of the clowns - who was married to \"The Woman Who Could Eat Anything.\"\n\nNow, this woman was able to eat anything - people would come from miles around to see her eat a whole bicycle. But her talent led to two problems.  \nFirstly, she was always hungry.\nAnd secondly, she was very large.  \n\nSo one night, while Bingo was sleeping in bed next to his wife, she started sleep eating. You've heard the tale of the person who ate their pillow in their sleep because they thought it was a giant marshmallow? That was her.  \nSo, completely asleep, she got up, reached out and grabbed the parrot from his perch and swallowed it whole, then went back to bed.  \nHer husband had awoken when she grabbed the parrot, because it screeched loudly, but was too late to do anything. He tried to wake up his wife, but she was so large that no matter how hard he pushed, he couldn't get her out of the bed, and he ended up sleeping on the couch because he was so angry about what she'd done\n\nOf course, the next morning, when he told people what happened, the other circus folk didn't believe he couldn't get his wife out of bed, and decided he simply *wouldn't* kick her out because of some secret loathing for the parrot.  \n\nSo you see, son. The truth is that someone would kick a woman out of bed for eating crackers. It's just that they're unable to do it because they're not strong enough.

Due to the great potatoe famine, there was a huge increase of Irish immigrants to England and both foot and horse traffic in the city was getting out of control. Some rando that worked for the railroad was hired by the city to come up with a solution to the problem.\n\nThe first traffic signal is born and promptly explodes injuring a bobby. Of course the cities officials immediately blamed the IRA, even though they wouldn't officially exist for another 60 years.\n\nDecades and more decades would pass before the finger pointing and foot stomping would end and a settlement was agreed to. In return for official acknowledgement of the Irish Republican Army in 1919 the Irish would allow use of their much guarded, but now unemployed, elite leprechaun signal corp known as the Illuminati.\n\nA test bed community was needed though that was outside either sides borders. They needed a city that was both neutrral to both parties, and had the available leprechaun population to put to work. \"What better place,\" said rando, \"than Amurika.\" \"We still owe em for that whole tea episode, and they have a huge irish population right smack dab in the middle of Detroit.\"\n\nA plan was formed. Funds were secretly transfered from the pots at the end of rainbows and tiny three story appartments were installed, and the leprechauns were put to work. \n\nBeing an extremely elite force of signalers, their sense of timing is almost flawless. If you are late for work, they know intuitively that you should stop for extended periods along the way to reflect on your inability to leave home earlier. If you are trying to avoid going to visit the inlaws, they just know that should you get there faster and get it the hell over with. And, if you, by chance have a hard time making speedy decisions under pressure, they are there to challenge you to either speed up or slam on the brakes in under .0003 seconds.\n\nThus, the Illuminati are in full control, and hiding in plain sight. Be safe out there on the roads, they are always watching.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1621839068.0},{"author":"DogsLinuxAndEmacs","text":"Magic.

I belong to a community of priests (not too proud, we're problematic, but we have a claim over some incredible mathematically genius ancestors). While the knowledge of these things has died out, my grandfather was the one of the last people to know about these things. \n\nThe short version is that your assumption is flawed, different time systems have always existed and still do. \n\nThe longer version is that humans tend to have the same understanding of the length of a day, as it is self evident. It starts when they wakeup and ends when they fall asleep, which is in turn tied to the sun rise and sun set. Similarly, a year is also very self evident, with the same seasons repeating and the angle of the sunrise changing at different times of the year. What is arbitrary (albeit with limitations) is the length of months, weeks, hours, minutes and seconds. And in they are different to different tribes\/communities. In my ancestors' case, there were some giant sun dial systems (jantar mantar) which were accurate to seconds. And ancient hindus indeed followed similar time systems. But there were also other units (apologies, I can't remember the names) which were different lengths of time. People who did not have access to complex sun dial systems in their local villages could perhaps use other instruments, and units of time could be different based on the limitations of such instruments. For example there is one type of \"clock\" which measured time based in on the drops of water that dripped from the earthen pots that were placed one above the other in tiers.\n\nIn the modern context, there is a difference between how Muslims' calendar works and how the modern Western calendar works. And same goes with Hindu and western calendars too.

They were having a lot of fun, with the kids running around and playing, barely building any character at all. The mom and dad mostly sat around eating, and drinking wine, being boring as adults usually are.\n\nMeanwhile, out on the pond, a family of ducks was paddling around happily, enjoying the summer sun sparkling on the water. Suddenly, one of the ducks, whose name was Downy, noticed something sparkling on the shore. \"That's funny,\" thought Downy, \"usually it's only the water that sparkles! I wonder what that is?\"\n\nDowny swam over to the shore to see what was sparkling. The sparkly object it had seen was in the grass near where the mom and dad were sitting, so Downy waddled over towards them, quacking innocently as though looking for food. Mom went, \"Aww, how cute! Here comes a duck looking for food!\" and tossed a piece of her sandwich towards Downy.\n\nMom and Dad watched as Downy waddled towards the food and gobbled it up. But then, as they were about to toss another piece of sandwich, they noticed Downy suddenly grab something else out of the grass. It was Mom's new cellphone that she got from Dad for her birthday! One of the kids must have knocked it off the picnic blanket into the grass, and Downy had seen the sun reflecting off it, making it sparkle. It was a brand new phone, one of the first with a built-in camera (I said this was a long time ago!)\n\nWith its prize in its beak, Downy turned and made a duckline for the water (bees make beelines, ducks make ducklines, remember that!) Dad started chasing after Downy to get the phone back. Downy flapped its wings a few times to get away, but that made the phone slip out of its beak! Downy made it safely to the water, and Dad found the phone lying in the grass near the shoreline.\n\nDad hiked up the grassy slope back to the picnic blanket, and turned on the phone to check that it was still working. When the phone turned on, he saw [this picture](https:\/\/imgur.com\/ckJne8l)! Downy's beak must have hit the take picture button just as it dropped the phone, accidentally taking a perfect selfie.\n\nUp until this time, no-one had ever thought to take a picture of themselves. Selfie sticks hadn't been invented yet. Dad realized this was an important new discovery, and asked Mom to try taking a picture of herself to post on the internet. Mom obliged, but as she took the picture, she made her lips into the shape of a duck's beak, because she thought it would be funny to make a picture like the one that Downy took.\n\nWhen they got home (phones didn't have internet in those days), they posted Mom's duck face selfie to a web site called Slashdot, which was the closest thing they had to reddit or instagram back in those days. The picture quickly became super popular, and soon people all over the world were copying it. Because the first ever human selfie was of a woman making a duck face, most of the early selfies were also taken by girls or women making a duck face, because they thought that's what you were supposed to do.\n\nThat tradition continues to this day, even though most people don't even know why. It's just become something women do when they take a selfie.","upvotes":26,"created_utc":1618090838.0},{"author":"Vindelator","text":"No one knows, Calvin.

They were a round tub, and they usually didn't have a lid. And mounted on top was a pair of tight rollers that you could hand-crank, and anything you put through them would have most of the water squished out of them. That device, the rollers that squish things, is the wringer. (Today washers spin really fast to get most of the water out.)\n\nThe whole thing was so simple that a child could use it. And that was a problem, because, well, kids like to see what else they can squish through the wringer. (If you're on a farm and video games won't be invented for another fifty years, this is the most exciting machine you're allowed to play with.) \n\nAnd kids, well, they don't have highly developed morality yet.  They haven't built character.\n\nYour grandmother tells stories about various things that went through the wringer. She wouldn't let me play with one we saw when I was a kid, because she knew how easy it was for fingers to get caught in it. She knew people who had broken bones. \n\nBut the stories she told the most often were things her brothers put through the wringers. \n\nIf you are at all squeamish, don't keep reading.\n\nSee, Great-Grandma hated snakes and mice, so the boys thought she wouldn't mind if they, ah, 'got rid' of a few by putting them through the wringer. Your grandmother was sparse on the details, but the results were very flat snakes and mice coming out of one side of the wringer, and all of the wet parts that were inside the animals got wrung out and dripped down the roller into the wash tub below. To the surprise of your grandmother's brothers, your great-grandmother was not, in fact, happy with their disposal of the mice and snakes.\n\nAnd it's not talked about in polite society anymore, but *everyone* had this experience. When your grandmother was a kid, everybody had done things that today would get them labeled as \"future serial killer\". Remember, there was no youtube, no internet at all. The way to find out what would happen if you did something was to do it. That's why we care about you developing character so much. (Seriously, everyone in your great-grandma's generation was a complete psychopath. She was officially a non-combat officer during the war, but that doesn't mean she didn't k- Your mother says I can't tell you that one. Your mother is right, listen to her.)\n\nBut that's the thing about \"being put through the wringer\", people today think it means 'had a hard day', 'had to deal with pressure', or that you had a challenge that made you sweat. But a couple generations back it meant \"you look like you didn't survive what you went through.\"\n\nThe next time you see your grandma, ask her about it.
