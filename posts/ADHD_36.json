This will negatively impact many people who do not have access to providers in their area or have stable care through telehealth. \n\nThe DEA has proposed a rule change that impacts controlled substance prescribed through telehealth, but not for Schedule II substances such as stimulants used in ADHD.\n\nI encourage everyone to submit public comments this month regarding this rule change and how it should be expanded to ensure minimal disruption to patient access to appropriate care. You can submit comments using the above link using the green button near the top that says \"submit a formal comment\".",

I picked up the meds today and only today found out I was prescribed the generic and not the brand name.  I sent him a text asking about the availability of Brand name since I understand that it has OROS (I studied pharmaceutical engineering in my undergrad). \n\nHowever, in the mean time I wanted to ask:\n\nSince I 1) am not a doctor and 2) only just got diagnosed with ADHD and 3) I’ve never been on meds \n\nwould it be better to just see how it goes with the generic Trigen Labs Concerta or is it better to make sure I get the brand name concerta and see how that goes since it’s my first time?",

        "text": "This is something that I realised last year and gave me a lot of mental peace since. I always wanted to do a million things, had lots of interests come and go and will get excited quickly about a new thing. I quit quickly with everything, except the few things that came back since childhood (drawing, reading and swimming). The past few years, every time something became more concrete I already didn't wanted to do it. When I got my hyperfocus on something amazing, the second it gets a bit hard I quit. Every time, every year, month and even week. Vacation jobs were hard to do and as such I became scared to work for real some day. I figured out I had severe fail-anxiety (I don't know if this term exists in English) and didn't see at first the connection with ADHD.\n\nBut then... I worked for a longer time in a new weekend job. It was hard in the beginning but after three months I didn't have to think about it. I got used to it and a few automatisms, routines and familiarity took away a LOT of mental weight.\n\nThis might sound normal to most people. But then I realised that I just crossed the learning curve.. I never did that. The past 15 years I switched hobbies, jobs and things to do so fast that I was always just tasting the steep beginning of the learning curve and before I could benefit from it I was already on a completely different steep start of a learning curve. No wonder I had fail-anxiety. Failing is the first part in learning something -&gt; but if you never learn long enough, failing becomes the ONLY part of learning.\n\nThe ADHD is still real in me, and will be with me for life. But realising this was comforting me. This knowledge finally led to me cooking more, reading more, getting back in programming etc. It also makes me choose very short and little things to learn. Small interesting things ... I had a lot of them the past year. I can't remember any of them right now but I am 100% sure I did them because I never was as enthousiastic about something here that I actually would post it on reddit. \n\nAlso I now work for a year as a teacher, it does get easier with time. I never thought that would be the case for me. I seriously thought that my career path would be 50 years of burnout. But I crossed the learning curve. I did it and I am still going. \n\nNice, peace out. love you all and thanks for making me feel normal &lt;3",

My doctor prescribed Nootropil 800 mg (Piracetam) twice a day as a first-line medication, but it wasn't available in the market. So, I went back to my doctor, and he prescribed Venlaxor 37.5 mg instead of Straterra, which he said was our last resort due to its potential side effects.\n\nHowever, after doing some research online, I found out that Venlaxor actually has more side effects than Straterra, and is usually prescribed for patients who don't respond well to first and second-line medications.\n\nI'm feeling a bit confused and concerned about the medication options available to me. Has anyone else had a similar experience with ADHD medication in a country where stimulants aren't available? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!",

Started missing assignments, getting low grades on tests, low grades in some classes. In general I was still pretty successful, though, because I was able to compensate for the most part with being able to understand and remember information easily.\n\nFast forward to professional life. I have a good job that I got straight out of college. I breezed through training requirements and had a great start into working. But my lack of good personal management ability started to really catch up to me. I would get distracted from my work easily, waste hours at a time playing games or sitting on social media after running into things that would take more effort in my work. I ended up on a Performance Improvement Plan with the warning that of things didn't improve, I would have to consider finding a different place to work.\n\nLuckily I had a manager who was able to really help me put together some work and time management strategies that dug me slowly out of that pit. I still have struggles with staying focused and not wasting time, but I have a couple good tools to help me get through.\n\nLast week I was diagnosed with ADHD and so much in my life makes so much more sense to me. I've got therapy appointments and doctors appointments scheduled to talk about therapy and medication. I'm so excited to hopefully transition from coping and compensating for these difficulties to actually thriving in my job and my personal life. I've been so down on myself because I know that I have so much potential to be successful but have been underachieving for years now. I don't want to get my hopes up too high but I really do hope that things can change for me.\n\nI don't really know if I have a specific reason for posting this other than getting my thoughts out but thanks for reading.

I accidentally submitted a BLANK assignment because by god there were 4 documents, and 2 blank duplicates, it was just such a mess. And I got the full points anyways so I guess the professor was fine with it? I asked if I could submit it again with the answers but no response. I don't care anymore, as long as I got full points it's fine.\n\nI'm so *tired* and increasingly agitated and emotional. I feel way more fragile to stress emotionally, and this is only day 2. I have to email my English professor to ask for extensions but I'm overthinking the wording a little and it's just so hard to write and draft out the email. My prescription has been ready since noon, but it's 4:35 pm and in another city half an hour away. No license, so I have to wait for my dad to pick it up once he finishes up his work from his job (he's working from home today, luckily). Everything has felt like such a pain in the ass this week. \n\nNot to be overly dramatic, but emotionally I'm a mess, I'm like an egg that's been poked and prodded too much and the yolk is spilling out, and I can barely keep it together. I'm so goddamn tired of this, screw this shortage man. I should have let my neuro prescribe the meds during my last appointment a month, I didn't let her because at the time there was no need. A dumb decision, I know...I was only mildly aware of the shortage at the time. Now it's 4:41 pm and I have to draft this email and send it out and hope the prof is understanding about it.

Luckily, the Strattera has been working out fine in terms of handling the symptoms I had.\n\nHowever, I still want to reduce my heart rate. It's not like I went from having a 70 resting heart rate to an 80 RHR -  I went from having a RHR in the 90s to 105+. I went to a cardiologist after being on Strattera and got an ECG to check that my heart was cool, and structurally it's fine, just beating super fast.\n\nMy last psychiatrist and the cardiologist would not put me on a beta blocker because they said it would interfere with the ADHD medicine, but my current psychiatrist says a small dose would be fine. Personally, I like my new psychiatrist and trust her more than my old one since the old one was more concerned about my ability to focus rather than the constant irritable mood I was in, which was my main concern. \n\nIs anyone taking either these or similar medications in tandem? If you are, do you feel like one diminishes the effect of the other?  &lt;3 thanks in advance!",

I’m so afraid to go off my meds, especially given the mental health vulnerabilities associated with pregnancy. Nonetheless, I’ve got appointments set up with my care team (OB, Psychiatrist) and am so nervous to hear their take on ADHD meds during pregnancy. At the end of the day, I know I have to be my own advocate and am prepared to have that conversation if needed. \n\nAll in all, just want to hear your experiences with ADHD and pregnancy. Overcoming guilt, advocating for yourself, symptoms, etc. any and all input/experiences welcomed! \n\nThank you.",

Around that time (i was about 7, him 4/5) i have this memory of going to a big building in a city ive never been qnd doing those mind test things and skipping school to go there all day and i believe that day my brother was diagnosed with adhd, i was diagnosed with nothing.  He definitely had it.  Growing up he was rowdy and hyper but i was always calm.  But in recent years ive always noticed similarities in my behavior and those who post adhd content to instagram.. Still didnt think much of it, because its just internet people and i shouldnt base judgements of myself on that, but still thought maybe i might have adhd.  Today i discovered there are two types, my brother exhibits the hyperactive type that ive always associated with adhd.  But the innattentive type really fits me.  I just watched an interview with a succesful, respected doctor describing symptoms of innattentive type, and i fit every single one.  Not just normal forgetfulness, to the point where its been an issue between me and my parents for years (a few of the symptoms the video mentioned).  I want to be officially diagnosed before just saying i have it and if i could id like to get help so i can feel normal.  But due to my diagnosis as a child im not sure its possible i have it, and i dont want to seem like im faking it or whatever.  What should i do?  Is it possible i was misdiagnosed?  Does this happen often?  Is it likely that i am just forgetful and playing it up in my mind? \nHeres the video:\nhttps://youtu.be/ToN-y8CNl-Q",

Whilst the drug produces an energetic and social high for them, I find myself to have a more concentrated and relaxing experience.   \nWhen under the influence of it, I find my mind and thoughts to be extremely clear and organised in a way I had never experienced previously.  \n\n\nIn usual day to day life, I find extreme emotions difficult to process and overwhelming, compared to my experience on MD when I feel more able to process my emotions and understand why I am experiencing them, rather than shutting down because of them.  \n\n\nIt increases my focus substantially and I am able to complete activities without distraction. It does not give me energy, more a relaxing tiredness.   \n\n\nI have only basic knowledge of the effects of stimulants with adhd as I have never tried medication. I understand that MD is a stimulant so may produce similar effects.  \n\n\nPlease share you experiences if you have had similar ones or if you have any knowledge to do with the subject, thank you",

I have pretty much zero experience doing any of this myself, but I’ve been diagnosed with adhd throughout my entire life, and I haven’t taken any medication since I was 17 (I’m 28 now). So I decided to start by calling clinics that specialized in ADHD, but they all require an official diagnosis, which requires an evaluation. Only problem is, the earliest I can get into recurrence that evaluation is in January 2024. The thought of waiting that long to get proper care is pretty depressing. Is there something I’m not thinking of? Should I just schedule with any old therapist? I’m not really sure what my next step should be, and I feel like it’s something obvious.",

Got the snack (I'm very food-motivated) but absent-mindedly put my water glass in the sink amid a pile of dirty dishes. Okay, I guess I'd better wash some of these dishes now. I'll put some music on while I do it...\n\nCool, I've washed all the dishes! Oh man, that table needs a wipedown. So does the coffee table over there. Hm, better straighten up the living room while I'm here. This sure feels better than sitting down and doing work would feel! Hey look, another thing I can clean!\n\nAnyway an hour later I'm back at my desk with a sparkling clean kitchen and living room, but still no glass of water.

        "text": "You can read many things about Depersonalization / Derealization disorder, or DP/DR for short, but I’m gonna sum it up in one paragraph. It can be as much of a revelation as reading about ADHD for the first time. \n\nDP/DR is feeling like either you or the environment you isn’t real. A dreamlike disconnected state. You might have felt like this for years and not know that it’s been there, you just feel off. You feel like you didn’t feel like this in your childhood before this. You feel very off, or not “with it”, if it’s prolonged for years you get used to it but every now and then you wake up and realize this is not normal.\n\nTo most people this is very scary and a sudden change, brought on by bad trips, smoking too much reed or a traumatic event. You have many very scared people on the DP/DR forums on Reddit asking when this will go away, but it generally goes away after days or weeks or months. It can also be brought on by prolonged anxiety. It might not be a sudden change but a gradual one. DP/DR is simply a defense mechanism of the body, not a disease. If the anxiety goes away the DP/DR goes away, although gradually as well. This is why DP/DR isn’t treated specifically, but rather the underlying anxiety is. \n\nThe reason why I’m writing about this is because I’ve been reading about DP/DR for years but ADHD is still pretty new to me. I wonder how I feel is really DP/DR or some kind of ADHD symptom. For instance not being able to perceive visual information around me because I am just so overloaded because of ADHD. At the same time the most logical conclusion I have is that ADHD brought along Anxiety (for obvious reasons), which in turn brought along DP/DR. \n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am currently in the tech industry and got a job as a Systems Administrator for a bank around 11 months ago, the job is meh and I can't break the feeling of quitting. This happens a lot, whenever I get a new position I try to learn everything that I can learn in the position and do the best that I can do but after about 6 months I start feeling 1 or all of these things below\n\n1. Bored of the job responsibilities\n2. Thinking about how I could get a job that pays better\n3. Overstimulated (too much work/too many responsibilities)\n4. Not enough free time/too much free time\n\nI could probably come up with a few more of these but I think you get my point. I don't know how to stop leaving jobs, and I think it may start to become a problem when I get higher up in this career field. I envy the people who stay at jobs for 3-4 years whilst at the same time hating the idea of staying at a job for that long. I always get this feeling like life is too short to spend 40 hours of my time every week at a company doing the same thing day-in day-out for 4 years with 2-weeks that the company \"graciously\" gives me to go do something I find fun.\n\nLuckily I guess the tech industry is notorious for job hopping because you can get further faster and increase your salary with every jump if you play your cards right. The cards however are hard to manage as it is a constant game of juggling free time with learning new in-demand technologies and it's a lot to handle. The point I'm trying to make is that while I love the idea of a high paying cushy job in tech I hate that my ADHD has only really allowed me to stick to a job for 1 year max for most of my life and even if I hit a salary point I was proud of I don't think I would even be able to stick with the job for long enough for it to make a difference in my quality of life.\n\nHas anyone had luck sticking with a job for longer than myself and if so do you have any recommendations on figuring out how to cope?",

We’re trying to save money because money is tight right now and I’ve been so depressed because I can’t really make plans and I’ve already gone on countless walks and hikes so I’m tired of doing things outside that don’t cost money. I also eat my feelings and always wanting treats like Starbucks, Icecream, or going to fave restaurants. Those kinds of things lift my mood so much and without it I feel depressed. I know I sound like such a spoiled princess but it’s a huge issue and I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried therapy to fix my food addiction and needing to spend money but nothing works. I’m bored of my hobbies I’m bored of everything I hate feeling this way 😭 does anyone have advice? Please be nice 😢",

        "text": "I'm becoming concerningly apathetic to the problems in my life at this point.\n\nFirst off:\nI check the box fr almost and all symptoms of ADHD I've seen out there but my parents don't believe it exists and I should just \"put in more effort\" despite the fact I've been a below average student most of my academic life. I've tried everything and I hated myself for most of my highschool years because I just thought I was dumb as a brickwall. And it hurts knowing you have potential and not being able to do anything about it. \nThe 3rd world country I live in isn't even aware of the existence of ADHD, you're just classified as \"unserious\" and \"unwilling to learn\" \n\nI know I have potential because despise everything I still push through and not be the worst of the worst academically. If the average is 50% I'm 47%. I just try to improve myself and I feel like nothing works. \n\nSecondly: I graduated highschool at 16 and got into university at 17 and as I speak I had to withdraw from that university at 19 because of how I was always below average. Later this year, I'm taking entrance exams to get into another university but I don't think I'll pass, I'm so burnt out I feel like I'll fail and be a college dropout and a loser at everything. After all said and done I'll just be a disappointment that'll overdose and die somewhere in the near future.\n\nI don't know what to do, I haven't been diagnosed, my country doesn't have access to meds and I just feel so lost.",

        "text": "Hi!\n\nSimply put, I am going through ADHD evaluation and was questioning... well, everything, basically.\n\nI'm obviously not talking about the usual attention deficit and the well known stuff.\n\nBut I was wondering if those things could be correlated with ADHD, or if any of you experienced those before.\n\n* **Always doing stuff at the last minute:** for example, if the homework deadline on Google Classroom is 23:59, I would almost always begin doing that at 23:30/45.\n* **Not remembering my past:** I've seen a lot of people on this subreddit complaining that they can't really remember things from their past. Same here. I can't remember what I did this weekend, I can't remember what I did this summer, I can't remember details from my childhood, etc etc... In some cases, if someone mentions a detail of a specific event, I can remember it, even if not completely. The rest is pure nothing or blurred memories. So I was wondering, do people without ADHD remember more than people with ADHD?\n* **Pressing on the \"opposite\" button:** for example, when I'm on YouTube and I want to skip 5 seconds, I press the \"&gt;\" key, but after that, I instinctively press \"&lt;\", even multiple times. Then, again, I press \"&gt;\" to return to the point of the video I was searching for. Same thing goes for \"Vol+\" and \"Vol-\" (on my laptop, on my smartphone and on my TV). Even when using my mouse, maybe while watching a YouTube video, I always press the right button multiple times, so that both the YouTube custom menu and the browser menu can appear. I could mention many more things, like \"accidental\" clicks in videogames (pressing the right/left button of the mouse instinctively), but the list would be really... endless.\n* **Forgettings things half a second later they enter my ears:** Pretty often, when someone speaks to me about something, I just... forget it. Even things I think about (for example, I think that I have to search something on Google, then I plug the charger in my phone, and I forget the fact that I had to search something). Almost always, when I listen to music, it's like some parts of the songs are skipped. I'm able to notice this especially with songs that have different singers in it.\n* **Accelerated time flow:** Maybe it's COVID-19's fault, but I remember the last two years being quite... fast. The last four months passed like if it was a week and I didn't even notice the end of the summer.\n\nI know I typed A LOT, but really, you could just look at the text in **bold**, it should be more than enough. Thanks in advance!",

I haven't had that relevatory mind clearing experience that some people seem to get, and I don't really feel much of a change in my ability to initiate tasks or anything like that and I feel about as distracted as normal. \n\nSo I'm just not sure if the initial dose is too low or if this is supposed to be an adjustment. Or something, I don't know. I'm also on 50 mg of pristiq, but that has definitely helped with my depressive energy and made me feel like myself again.\n\nWhat are your experiences with adzenys?",

        "text": "I am 20 years old and have recently got diagnosed with ADHD and started Vyvanse, which works wonders. I’ve had ADHD for the majority of my life, but my parents were very anti-medication and would often cause me to question whether my struggles were real or not. \n\nI started using Vyvanse in January, and my doctor wanted to ease me into 30mg. I did a week on 10mg, two weeks on 20 mg and a month on 30mg.\n\nDuring the last few days of using 20mg, I noticed that it no longer helped with my ADHD, and I felt incapable of doing anything. Similar happened when I was at the end of my 30mg.\n\nMy doctor adjusted my dosage to 40mg, which has been working wonderfully. However, I am worried that, like before, it will stop working.\n\nI find that Vyvanse has really helped me and honestly changed my life. I am able to fully commit to my health, mental health, university, and I am able to regulate myself in ways I haven’t been able to do before.\n\nI’ve been anxious that I may eventually need to up my dosage until I reach the max and then be left hopeless when it stops working. Additionally, how my parents raised me adds another layer of anxiety that they may be right.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I am relatively new to anything medication related and would like advice or reassurance. Any message would be appreciated; thank you.",
