        "text": "16F. I have Asperger’s and I’m naturally socially awkward, but outside of that I don’t have many friends and I’m not social at all. \n\nThere’s this guy (17M) in my class, he’s also introverted from what I caught on, and we have things in common. We’ve talked plenty of times, but never actually become friends outside of school. \n\nI wanna get to know him better and potentially become friends, but I’m anxious, so I’ve decided I can bake some cupcakes for him as some kind of non-verbal friendship offering Lol.\n\nHere are my concerns:\n\n1. Is this too extra? I’m afraid of going too fast into the friendship and already offering him stuff when truly we don’t even know eachother that well. I’m scared of scaring him off! I’m also gonna be giving cupcakes to my other friend that day, but I’m much closer with her. One of my friends says this feels like something out of a corny romance novel and I’m starting to believe her.\n\n1. I’m a little scared of what other people will think… And if I ask him to follow me somewhere like the lockers so I can hand them to him privately, what if they hear/see and get suspicious about it? Ugggh the fear is wrecking me!\n\nPlease let me know what you think, and if you have any other ideas for how to handle this, tell me as well.",

I have gone through many articles, but none of them have been able to perfectly match my situation, so I figured I would post here.\n\nI went through about a year and a half of social anxiety and comparing myself to others, and now I feel that I am finally on the end of that road. With that being said, this boost in self confidence has caused me to use social media significantly less. I was over in Europe for a semester and stopped using Snapchat, then I used BeReal for awhile and got bored of it. I am concerned because I am looking to expand my social circle. If I don't post on social media, will people start to think that I am not interested in them and pull away? Is that how this works? Should I learn how to use social media if I want to expand my social circle and make new friends?\n\nThank you!",

If I am, how do I change my mentality to not take comments in such a negative way.\n\nMy friend asked me how I’ve been, and I told him same old same old, just working my usual 9-5 while studying for career change. I have a new exam to take in 2 weeks on top of projects I’m doing at home. I told him that I networked with some of the engineers at my company who provided a roadmap on how to get in their cyber team.\n\nI was originally planning to be an cyber analyst but we only have engineers (doing both engineering and analyst work), so I told my friend I may have to leave because we don’t have true engineers and I don’t want to spend the next 8-12 months learning coding on top of the analyst stuff. I would rather enter the cyber field as a analyst to gain relevant experience, and then prepare my way into a engineer role (within cyber) down the road due to path of least resistance.\n\nMy friend remarked “oh man, you’re doing a lot of switches aren’t you. First cyber, now coding. I don’t know man”.\n\nThis comment really rubbed me off the wrong way and I immediately got defensive and explained that it’s the same field, broken up into analyst and engineers and my company does not have true analyst roles.\n\nI think I felt bothered because Ive spent the last 7 months working my normal 9-5 and studying 7-11 for different certs and picking up analyst knowledge. It almost feels like my friends are doubting my efforts because I haven’t changed jobs yet. I’m paranoid they think I just talk and do nothing.\n\nGranted, outside folks tend to either over-romanticized or underplay the difficulty of cyber. And he honestly probably had no idea what the difference is between analyst and engineer and thinks it’s all one big thing.\n\nAm I overreacting and how do I stop?",

        "text": "Here's a neat little trick I discovered over years of journaling my fitness progress\n\nNext time you're about to leave the house, write down a sentence; any sentence. \n\nHow your handwriting appears at this present moment in time can indicate how are going to feel in a public setting.\n\nYour job is to analyse the state of your handwriting and compare it with something you've written while feeling good &amp; a time you've written something feeling bad. \n\nIf your handwriting is larger, looser &amp; more careless than usual, you are less likely to feel anxious\n\n**However**\n\nIf it appears small, compact, or written with a heavy hand, it's likely you're going to feel more on-edge/socially avoidant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why this is a superpower:** \n\nWriting is one of the many forms of expression. If you're expressing yourself in a certain way, it's almost guaranteed to carry over to other forms of expression, i.e. body language &amp; verbal communication\n\nHaving awareness of your current state of mind gives you the ability to influence it.\n\nYou may have heard that there is a thin line between \"anxiety\" and \"excitement\".\n\nThat's because both are tied to chemical excitation i.e. an overproduction of glutamate\n\n**This is where things can get magical.** \n\nThere are a multitude of ways you can influence your current state. As a biohacker I personally focus on three methods:\n\n**Supplementation:** \n\nThe easiest, but probably least effective route. Certain supplements like taurine or L-theanine can help increase the relaxing neurotransmitter, GABA, which helps counteract an overly excitatory state. My favourite supplement for anxiety is using pine pollen tinctures, however I would not suggest using it more than twice weekly due to potential (unconfirmed) risks. \n\n**Bioenergetic-style therapy:**\n\nEmbrace ridiculousness. Bioenergetics takes into account that stress &amp; trauma store in the body. A bioenergetic form of release could range from screaming at the **top** of your lungs (most people can't do this), to punching your pillow into oblivion, to rolling around on the floor like a child. The trick here is to **completely let go.** If I told you to let loose and go wild right now, you won't be able to do it. There is a level of conditioning in your brain that stops you from going over a certain point that would bring attention to you. Your goal here is to **break those boundaries.** Clapping loud in a public setting is fantastic because it makes you realise, people will look for 5 seconds and forget about it. \n\nNobody cares, and that's a liberating feeling. \n\nMassage &amp; exercise are also other ways you can influence your state through the body. \n\n**Win more:**\n\nThe more you can break things down into tiny victories, the more victories you'll have. The more victory your brain perceives, more your body will reward you and push you to continue to winning. \n\nIt's fascinating how much you can influence your entire physiology through just framing things differently.\n\nCan't get up from bed? Count down from 10 and give yourself that little win. Struggling to go to the gym? Hell, give yourself the win for leaving your house. Once you're at the gym, you're not not going to train -- another win. \n\nBy breaking things into stepping stones, you create an easy method to shift your psychological state towards moving forward. This is such an effective way of thinking and you'd truly be amazed how far you can get yourself in a week.\n\n**To summarise:**\n\nAwareness is ultimately the key. Paying attention to your handwriting is one way, but also body language, tonality, etc.\n\nOnce you can identify an issue, you can work towards fixing it, and that philosophy has carried me hard from a dark place 6 years ago to where I am now.\n\nGod bless and good luck\n\n\\- Tested Man",

I don't have a single person in my life who I could confide in.\n\nI have a very difficult time being vulnerable. It has made relationships in the past difficult because my partner realizes they have no clue who I am. \n\nI think the constant joking is a defense mechanism against having to be vulnerable. \n\nThere's a lot of people I could quote in describing this, but friends have complained that they've \"never seen me express a negative emotion\" several times.\n\nI don't know what to do, because if I were to talk about what's on my mind, I doubt others would relate. I have generally very different interests from others my age (high school). \n\nAlso, when I try and be serious, people assume I'm making a joke. \n\nThe reason I'm worried about this is that in group projects it has been a challenge to assume leadership. It's been possible at times, but I need to be taken seriously not for high school, but for my career.\n\nDoes anybody have experience with these issues? How do I fix myself?

The people I want to be around don’t want to be around me. \n\nAfter she told me this I decided to walk away and call it an evening. I feel so ashamed really. On the other side I feel intrigued: are people really shooting me down on being pushy?",

Since I am the senior of this research group, I was tasked by my boss to help this woman out and carry on the onboarding process. And right know I oversee her work.\n\nI feel like being hit on by this woman. She is always finds me amazing and anything I do amazing. Like If i say \"I play drums\" she would be amazed. She always complements me about my chillness and intelligence. And today she said \"I like your existence, it makes me happy\". \n\nNow this woman knows that I am happily married. She has met with my wife. She even had the nerve to say  \"your wife is lucky to have you\".  So I am uncomfortable here, I don't like being hit on by her. I know that there might be a possibility of her being super friendly to males and she just thinks she is being friendly to me. So I don't want to jump to gun and be direct to her. But nonetheless I don't like the situation I am in. \n\nI also told about this woman to my wife we both think that this woman is hitting on me.\n\nI don't know what to do. I try to ignore this woman as much as I possible. I try to avoid small talk with her as much as possible. But she is not getting the message here. I don't want to be mean and say \"stop hitting on me\" or something. And I don't want to talk to other woman in this group about this. Because they might think that this woman is the \"slut\" of this group. \n\nHow should I proceed?",

        "text": "I 19m am autistic, have ADHD, anxiety, and depression. For all my childhood I was able to blend in and didnt even think anything of it when my parents told me I wasnt normal. As I got older though I very quickly became incapable of making friends and have never been able to figure out exactly why. It feels like I get treated differently than everyone else and that everyone can tell something is wrong with me. At first I noticed a lot of girls would talk to me in what I didn't notice at the time was the kind of voice you'd talk to a baby with and what I also at the time thought was them thinking I was cute i later would relize was the kind of cute no one older than a toddler wants to be. \n\nHalfway through middle school though this suddenly became everyone keeping more distant than they would other people and I believe heavily contributed to an incident that resulted in me losing every one of my childhood friends. I've never been able to recover and the only thing I can point too as a reason is social ineptitude and that I may give off a strange vibe to people. I also believe this is the reason my only ever crush lied to me and told me she wasn't ready for a relationship only to be making out with a guy a week later. \n\nI stupidly believed everything would get better once I went to college because everyone had always told me how people where much more accepting at that stage and social stiff became much more fluid. I wrote off all my doubts as just insecurities but I should have k own my gut feeling was right and that none of that was really true. As I struggled to fit in there I eventually resulted to just telling people exactly what was wrong with me hoping that knowing it would make them more understanding. That was a huge mistake. It instantly ruined any chance at a friendship with them. Around half way through the semester though I thought I had finally had finally hit the lucky strike I had been looking for all those years. I met some people I got along well with and one of them was even on the spectrum like me. Unfortunately I hadn't done well in May classes thus far mostly due to my mental state and 2 bad teachers. So I was stressed all the time and this made my insecurities much worse. Thus lead to me eventually laying in my my dorm in the dark for three days straight and the only person who checked in on me was an RA who wasnt even mune came to my room after my mom pestered them for hours because I never noticed her calling. I finally went back to class and when one of my friends asked where I was I just lied and said I was sick. A week later though something happened that at least partially proved all my insecurities. Someone who was occasionally part of our group didn't show up to class and everyone was messaging them because they were worried. Not one person other than my mom had tried to contact me those three days I was locked away. They didn't care about me as much as they did someone they knew and saw less. That along with the other guy on the spectrum leaving broke me. I basically zoned out the rest of the semester and because I never did anything I failed all my classes. \n\nAnyway I've since been taking online classes to repair the damage done to my GPA and have been accepted to transfer into two colleges that have programs that help people on the spectrum. They are very small however and can't accept many people. I have now been rejected from one and it seems increasingly likely I will be rejected by the other as well. So I came here to ask how I can get people to look past what's wrong me because I'll probably have to do it all on my own again and I don't want want to have what's been happening almost half my life to happen again. How can I get people to like me despite how abnormal am am?\n\nSorry this was so long I kinda just started ranting because I felt context was needed. This probably won't be seen by anyone but at least I put what's on  my mind out there.",

I grew up in an extremely dysfunctional household and was bullied for most of my childhood by my own family, not sibling teasing but straight up bullied by adults. They tried to break me down day by day but by the grace of god I remained a sane child. They did not succeed breaking me down to my face so another form of method was used called campaign sameer. Which was successful. I had an extremely toxic father aswel and living under his roof was like walking on egg shells because his behaviour was so unpredictable. A lot more things happened to me as a child which I would not like to go into but involves s/a by multiple people. Despite never going to therapy, only telling 1 person about it.  I thrived when I left the house in my later years.  I thrived socially, I was confident, out spoken fearless and a such an extrovert. I have been told by many people that I gave an inner and outer glow about me and I'm destined to go far in life. I was so optimistic about life and lived every opportunity to the fullest and went after my dreams at the time. I hated my family so I poured so much love into all my friends (big mistake.). Most of my friends turned out to be were jealous, competitive, shallow. snakes waiting for my downfall because they couldn't believe  why I was loved by many and how I was this confident. My enemies have now won. \n\nThe last 3 years of my life have been a living nightmare. I have have unexpected life alterations, my mental health is absolutely ruined. That girl I became out of sheer fight or flight is gone. Men I have dated in the past have sexually assaulted me and a few r'ed me and yet I haven't told anyone but has resurfaced in my mind.  I am so insecure now, I am paranoid, I don't trust people at all. I get uncomfortable around any man even in public and I have to pretend that it doesn't happen but deep down my mind is going into overdrive. I am socially anxious all the time. All my confidence is gone. My memory is ruined and its affecting so many areas of my life. I have mental blanks in my memory due to the heavy mental torture as a child and heavy gaslighting.  Mentally I am stuck in life. I can't excel in anything I do. One moment I'm fine, the next I'm crying and then I forgot what I was even crying about and its been like that for a while. I have tried many ways of healing but it doesn't work. I won't be able to settle down with anyone in the future because I find receiving love so weird and its an odd feeling. I hate physical touch. Family love, bonds with siblings I find so weird and uncomfortable to witness. \n\nMy remaining friends have moved on in life and have careers and I'm just stuck.  I have never been a type of person to compare anything because I always believed in my self and focused so much on myself but as the day goes on I'm declining. My friends have tried to help me but its my issues are way bigger than them. I can't afford therapy.  I am not where they want me to be or who I used to be. I can tell they are starting to get sick of me because I can't keep up with them. They have put up boundaries which is fine but I feel like I'm back to having nobody. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow can I overcome this rut I'm in?",

One day he agreed to hang out but almost immediately said he had a stomach ache and had to go home. \n\nIts very confusing for me because he is extremely friendly in class and at the gym but when I ask him to hang out he seems uninterested. This is even more confusing because when we do talk in person he says he wants to hang out a bunch and suggests ideas but then when I text him asking to hang he makes excuses. \n\nI feel like im over analyzing the situation but I also feel very annoying trying to hang out with him all the time just for him to give the same lame excuses. It feels like he is just friendly to me in person but doesnt actually want to be friends outside of class. Any suggestions?",

I’ve been purposely excluded on a few occasions I know of for certain. I got invited to my boss’s house for a company and friends lunch, but I sincerely do not want to go. I don’t work with many people, there are only 6 people total on staff besides myself. They regularly meet for lunches of this sort, and have been for months, yet this is my first time being invited. They have a gaming group, and other hobbies they will all spend time with each other on their days off. I feel left out so much of the time, the past 2 years, I don’t even want to go out with them anymore it just sounds exhausting to listen to them talk about all their time spent hanging out with each other. I have the day off from my other job, but I still would rather just stay at home by myself. What would you do? How can I politely decline without giving myself away &amp; being rude?",

In high school, I made some acquaintances, but now that I'm a sophomore, I don't know anyone at all.\n\nWhat's worse is that it seems like everyone I meet ends up hating me, even though I'm always nice and polite. For example, I tried out for the university choir last semester, but I couldn't make it to rehearsals because I had too much homework. When I finally went to a rehearsal, I found out that people were talking behind my back, saying that I skipped rehearsals on purpose. It's happened to me more than once, and everytime I never know what I did wrong \n\nAlso, I'm a huge people pleaser. I act really nice to everyone because I'm scared they won't like me if I'm myself. I know that it makes me look fake, but I can't help it. I think that's why people don't like me, and it makes me feel even worse.\n\nI don't know what to do next.

        "text": "Hey guys, this is just my experience, but I want to give some advice that I’ve never heard anybody else say before. \n\nAnd that’s to stop listening to your headphones at any get-together, or public space in general. I believe doing this can negatively affect your social life, and here’s why: \n\n1. People don’t want to approach you because they don’t want to interrupt you listening to your music\n\n2. Generally it looks like you want to shut out the world and avoid people\n\n3. You’re missing opportunities to talk with people because your attention to the music is causing you to not hear the conversations, and observe the people around you. Basically it’s like mimicking a slight disassociation, making it more difficult to create/notice opportunities for opening topics. \n\n4. A lot of music can actually put you in a mood where you don’t want to socialize.  I say this with no offense, but if you’re listening to rap, it’s likely pumping up your ego, making you feel like you’re better than the people around you, which doesn’t set you up well to connect with them. \n\n5. When you become anxious, you might justify listening to your music as an excuse to not socialize. \n\nI’m not sure your guys’ thoughts on this, but I think a lot can be missed out on if you have your headphones in. Especially those of us trying to better our social abilities as fast as possible, any interaction, such as with a bus driver, mailman, co-worker, etc. is useful to us, as well as hopefully enjoyable for both parties. So I recommend only listening to music at home. \n\nI made this change and I noticed a change in myself, mood, and increased connections and conversations with others. Try it out👍",

        "text": "I'm 25M and I took a solo vacation this past weekend. It was actually a first for me for a lot of things. First vacation by myself. First time attending a concert. First time renting a car and doing a lot of driving.\n\nI had told my brother about a month ago that I was going to make this trip and to let me know if he wanted to go. About 2 weeks ago, I asked him again and never heard back from him. This ended up being a last-minute booking, which he ended up getting pissed off at me for. I really don't understand  why though because I told him twice and never heard back from him.\n\nAround the time I booked the trip, I felt really alone. Like having no friends to go with.\n\nThere were 3 moments when I particularly felt very sad and depressed. One was on the flight there when there was a fight between 2 passengers as I was getting off the plane literally right next to me. Then, when I was at the Pitbull concert, the people right behind me (older adults) got into some sort of fight and got arrested. Lastly, I left Washington D.C. later than expected and ended up on the road late at night. I was driving through the Blue Ridge Mountains, it was like 1AM and I was so tired, and the roads were so steep. I cried for an hour looking at the empty seat next to me.\n\nFor about 4 weeks before this trip, I had been talking to two people on Snapchat. I finally realized how toxic the one was with how she always was mentioning how people are dispensable and the other just ended up being someone I realistically didn't like. I eventually blocked both of them and now I am alone again.\n\nIdk. I never really had friends. I always thought I just had bad luck rather than being a repulsive person who justifiably has no friends. I had an online friend who ghosted me after 5 years. Other than that, I used to have a lot of toxic friends that I eventually gained the self-respect to stop talking to.\n\nI think the happiest moment was when I was leaving at the Atlanta airport. I returned my rental car and was with another family on the rental car train who was getting on board a Delta flight to Florida (like me, but different flight). We talked a little in the train and then again wound up on the same passenger train to the same terminal. I was kind of disappointed I made no effort to maintain a relationship with them.",

If I ask them if they want to do something, they usually try to come if they have the availability and will seem like they are enjoying their time whenever they go. \n\nSam on the other hand tends to seem a lot more disinterested in general and it honestly feels like a chore to even invite them. If the topic is not something they were previously interested in, they just become a dead person and give super short answers. Their excuse is (I'm either all into something or not into it at all), but this just feels like an excuse for being close minded. They almost always deny an invitation to do something if I ask alone but they want to hop along only if I invite the other two. They even get annoyed when they figure out I invited the other two before him.\n\nHow does one deal with a situation like this?

I posted about this on r/Zillennials recently because I felt like this might be more prevalent for people in my age group, but no one there seemed to feel this was an issue for them.\n\nMaking friends is really hard for me (24F), and it seems that the few people I connect with end up avoiding hanging out in person, but will still text and message me a lot. There was one girl who was my closest friend for years, but eventually started avoiding the topic of hanging out in person, but still sent me messages constantly on snapchat. It felt like she wasn't even interested in interacting with me, but like she got a dopamine boost every time she took an ironic selfie to send to someone and I was just a means for her to feed that. Similarly, I went on a few dates with a guy last fall who started being evasive about going out again, but still texted me every day. I confronted him about if he even wanted to see me anymore and he admitted that he didn't. But still kept texting me every day and sending me memes. I just stopped replying to him; why would I go to the effort of putting myself out there just to end up with the burden of having to exchange pixels with yet another person, but ultimately still be alone? And I feel like this phenomenon is happening with other people I befriend at school, work, my choir, etc. I'll get close to a person and we get to know each other on a more personal level, but they always flake out on getting together in real life; the only thing that makes us \"friends\" is that we text each other outside of whatever obligation we know each other from.\n\nI already use messaging to keep in touch with friends in another state from before I moved, so I do value digital  communication, it's not that I think it's pointless. And obviously I'm on Reddit, I value the camaraderie on this site from sharing hobbies and interests with other people. But literally every single friend I have, the vast majority of our interaction is through computers. And I feel crazy for being unhappy about that, it's like I'm living in a Black Mirror episode and am the only one who sees how dystopian this all is. I'm not friendless, yet I don't hang out with anyone on the weekends, I don't get together with someone just for the sake of being together. My free time is mostly spent alone, sometimes with my family. Looking at pixels on a screen is not a relationship. I want to talk to someone in real-time, feel mentally stimulated, hear someone laugh and see them smile at me. That's what creates a real bond. I feel so starved of connection and I feel like there's no way to get it in the current world I'm living in.",

So today while coming back from college i noticed a man sitting on stairs of a train station. His head was down and he had earphones on. He looked down so i thought if i should approach him and check on him but i got scared what would happen if i did that. But after reaching home i have been thinking this and feeling guilty that i should have checked on him.",

Recently, I joined new school made many friends but it seems like they never value me and not respecting. Why I can't make strong bonding with friends. Despite being good person I respect them but they never value me and also does not like to hangout with me. \nAll my friends are really high valued many students respect them and  also the high valued girls fall in love with them. All students want to be friend with them . They have really the big social circle but I don't have any.\nThese things really affect my self and my confidence.i don't feel confident anymore!",

        "text": "So I've been meaning bring about changes in me. From the way I walk to the way I talk there are so many faults in me. I wanna change myself real bad.\n\nFirstly, I get overexcited when talking. Like I'd say stuff louder than I intended. Then I'll regret until its too late. It also gives me away. Like I'd have said it better but I blurt it out so suddenly... worse it results in poor communication \n\nSecondly, I've trying to talk clever. Like while texting someone I'm extremely versatile with my words. But then real life comes and I cam hardly finish sentences before getting overridden. I do get ignored too. I hate it. \n\nThirdly, I get distracted with my own thoughts even while listening to someone. I try to concentrate and end up doing that too much.\n\nFourthly, people tend to smile alot at me, some even laugh. It wasn't until one of them asked: why do I look so worried all the time? I think I'd smile more often. But that too tends to send the wrong signal sometimes.\n\nLastly, I feel really insecure of the above flaws, like I've always been bullied many times. Just entered college and first year went fine without much problems. Now in second year I'm being made fun of by groups for being either too overexcited or well anything else.",
