It's the one with Din and Grogu walking toward the camera as it slowly pulls back. We all know that Mando uses the volume to film a large percentage of its shots. There are quite a few scenes in this town setting during the premier episode and I think they all look fantastic and believable *except* this one.\n\nSo, VFX and filmmaking experts, what is it about this show that doesn't work as well? I suspect it might be because you can't see them physically connected to the setting in any way, but there are others shots where that is the case that look great. Is it the lighting? Something to do with the depth of field? I'm really curious to know what more knowledgable people have to say",

[Flipper](https://youtu.be/azEOeTX1LqM) \\- I thought it was pretty inventive to do a show around a dolphin.\n3. [Mr Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cI-LXMyyDo) \\- Although super cheesy it was kind of the OG of animal shows.  And Alan Young is a btter actor than people give credit.\n4. [Mr Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRg-n5nKQAQ) \\- I don't why I feel like it's cheating. A talking chimp doing tricks but it was fun short-lived show. And the premise was far out.\n5. [Lassie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOTVINXjYgg) \\- I'm sure people would have this higher on their list as this is probrably the most popular longest lasting animal centered show. But that's the reason why I rank it 5 - which 5 is still great but as the seasons progressed I grew tired of it.\n\nAny other shows? I know Bengie. Any Bengie fans?",

Space doesn't work like that! Inertia, ever head of it?! Weirdly later the same or next episode they have exposition about relative speeds of objects in space and use composted human remains as explosives(huh?) to subtly change their trajectory, so inertia does exist! Then they need to match the speed of a passing comet anchor into it.\n\nI don't usually make hate watch threads but goddamn!",

        "text": "I tried Yellowstone for the first time this week. Now IMDB rating is not something that says a lot but 8.7 says something. Also I've heard a few good things.\n\nBut the show is really surprisingly bad, I'm at like episode 5/6 season 1. The story is absolutely dreadful and plays like a scratched vinyl. Every episode something completely new extremely unlikely event happens that just keeps setting the story back\n\nThe acting is mostly either bland, Kayce, Monica hell even Costner to a degree. Or they're overplayed like the sister and Jamie. And all the characters are dumb as hell, Kayce Jamie and the sister are all acting like teenagers. The only thing I can appreciate to a degree are the cowboys and Rip.\n\nI mean in a span of like 3 episodes there's been a snake attack, bear attack, kid fell into a river and almost died, 2 random kidnappers, they start construction on the one spot where the bodies are buried within days of the murder, a fucking meth lab explosion the moment they drive by and Kayce has to shoot the survivor. It's absolutely ridiculous the amount of unlikely shit that happens that affects the plot.",
