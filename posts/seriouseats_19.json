So I just used more bread, besides that I didn't change the recipe. \n\n\n What I'm mainly curious about is if it's okay to cook the loaf in a 12in cast iron pan so I can collect the fat and make gravy after it bakes? In the recipe he cooks it on a heavy duty foil on a sheet pan. Just wondering if it's a huge deal or if I'll burn my meatloaf. Will it be impossible to get out of the skillet or will it fuse to the pan? Should I oil my skillet? \n\nThanks for any answers, I'm not the most experienced cook.",

It's a major staple in my household and I'm even going to make it for my wedding in July. \n\nI want to adapt that recipe for my new instant pot but I'm concerned about one step in particular has me slightly concerned. Before baking you're supposed to cover the meat and aromatics with oil, ostensibly to replicate the \"cooked in lard\" level of flavor you get from professional carnitas. This makes sense to me and definitely seems to work in practice. However all of the pressure cooker recipes for carnitas that I've seen talk about adding chicken stock instead, which I'm loathe to do. At the same time, almost all pressure cooker recipes need liquid in the pot to help it create the pressure.\n\nSo my question is: Will my instant pot work if I out vegetable oil in there with the pork instead of a water based liquid? Will it blow up or scorch the hell out of the cooking vessel?",

The charcoal on burnt toast is bitter, but does seem to have any application in dishes (there's probably a way).  \n\n\nI've notice when I roast fresh Brussel sprouts (w/olive oil, pepper, salt) in my awesome Breville toaster oven little bits of char make them even better.  Today I was making them and gave them a little broiler time at the and and got distracted.  This time I cut them in half.  All of the top leaves were 80% charred.  I was looking at almost solid black. I pulled them immediately and put them at a cooler side of the room to cool them quickly.  I noticed all of the blackness were the top petals (or whatever you call them). there was a gap between the top petals and below because the top leaves rose away from the others.  Maybe too much info. Anyway I found it easy to take off all the charred petals.  Then the sprouts were fine to eat.  \n\nThen I started eating some of the charred leaves.  Strange. They were tasty.  Not like the acrid taste of scraped off charred toast. I got to thinking. These charred petals can be used as a source of bitterness (the taste least paid attention to) that can be added to anything.  Perhaps salsa, and stews, omelets. I don't know much about pairing bitterness to be honest.  Whoever is an expert on 'bitterness' in cooking could probably match these charred sprout petals to a lot of dishes.  \n\nJust a thought.  Knock yourself out if you progress from this lead.",

I steamed the broccoli in the morning until it was bright green and still a bit crunchier than I would like, laid on paper towels to dry for a few minutes, then stored in the fridge in a paper towel-lined ziploc until it was almost time for dinner. Then I made the cheese sauce in a saute pan (2 Tbsp butter only, then wet ingredients, then the cheese which was pre-tossed in the dry stuff). Dumped the broccoli into a baking dish, poured cheese sauce over top, mixed it up a bit, put in oven at 350 until warm all the way through. It came out great! ",
