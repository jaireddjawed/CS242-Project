The one thing we all had in common is having nvidia drivers installed. I was immediately able to remove the oracle kernel, but apt got into a loop when trying to remove the other extra kernel, lowlatency, installing the unsigned version if I removed the signed version, and then installing the signed when I removed the unsigned -- the fix for that, if you've had this happen, is to first remove the nvidia signed module for lowlatency before removing the lowlatency kernel.",

His family doesn't want to upgrade ( Members of the cult of Windows 7) but I can't in good conscience continue to let this man use window 7,  Especially with his bank account, with its wild security vulnerabilities. I'm considering upgrading the man to a Linux system, but he has little to no computing experience. He refers to himself as \"The troglodyte\" and is mostly not that interested in learning. \n\n Another issue is that this machine will be shared with his family, and his mother in particular is a MASSIVE Conspiracy Theorist. On 1 hand, that helps limit the damage she can do with viruses. ( She infects the thing about once a week visiting who knows what conspiracy sites. I'm amazed the thing still functions) On the other, I shudder to think what this woman can do with the power of The terminal. One \"Do you want to stop the intergalactic lizard space aliens from being able to read your mind? Simply input this into your terminal!\" could wreck the entire system. With no recourse beyond a full reinstall. \n\n Is there any distro, or anything, that I could do/recommend that could possibly help them? Something very beginner friendly. Would it be possible for me to disable the terminal, to minimize the damage that could be done, and still have a usable experience?  Before continuing I would be sure to verify it with them.  I'm not one of THOSE Linux guys That would swap an entire system's OS without telling them and getting permission.  The thing is absolutely ancient and borderline unusable in its current state, So I wouldn't be hurting anything by potentially switching it over. Trying to help the guy out, and weighing my choices. I have rudimentary Linux experience, and would be able to help at the beginning if need be, which I'm sure it would be. That's one advantage I didn't have starting out. Any advice, or is this just too risky of a thing to do?",

        "text": "**TL;DR:** See **bolded** text below for questions, but I think you'll find the story amusing.\n\nI'm hoping this is the best place to post this, if not, please let me know what would be better.\n\nI was working on a Linux website host server years ago, and my boss hired some people in another country to work overnight. When a freshman couldn't get access to something (that he didn't know he didn't need), he ended up using sudo (not my decision to allow them to do that) to give himself all permissions to all files starting from the root directory.\n\nWhen I got a call in the morning from my boss (who's head I could hear crackling from the fire burning through his hair) saying that everything was down, I came in and tried to fix anything. When I realized what happened, I decided it would be less worth trying to figure out which permissions needed to be fixed (or what they were all supposed to be) than just restoring from the night's backup (which happened before the rookie user logged in fortunately).\n\nWhat happened - rather than the expected thing, the restore just working - was that the restore got stuck after a few hours... I called host support (a third party) and they said to try again. We did, and the same thing happened. When I finally got escalated multiple times, they said that we were on their \"old\" hypervisor, and that because the backed-up data would take up more than, like, 46% of the virtual drive's storage space (I think it was like 67%), it couldn't restore because of how it \"unfolded\"... the explanation was completely ridiculous (even though I understood it), and my boss and I got escalated up to the CEO where we could unload on him.\n\nSubsequently, I think we had to convert the backup to their \"new\" way, then it could restore. Why we were never warned about the potential issue (maybe we were before I got there, I'm not sure) was a dispute point. However... we lost an employee over it, who was probably traumatized, and I got yelled at more than adequately for deciding to go with the restore. Regardless...\n\n**My questions here are**: Have you ever had to restore permissions on a system that had been overridden from root by a sudo user? When you fixed it, did you feel it was more worth just trying to fix the permissions than restoring from a backup?\n\nIn my case, I'm still 90% on the side of trying the restore based on the situation. The alternative (fixing permissions manually) probably could have been much worse over a long period of time, or... well, I don't know, maybe it would have just created a lot of paid work to myself and others :shrug: (I hadn't really thought of that angle until just now hah).",

The OOM killer allows killing a single task (called also oom victim) while that task will terminate in a reasonable time and thus free up memory. \n\nWhen OOM killer does its job we can find indications about that by searching the logs (like /var/log/messages and grepping for “Killed”). If you want to configure the “OOM killer” I suggest reading the following link [https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/it-infrastructure/dev-oom-killer.html](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/it-infrastructure/dev-oom-killer.html).  \n\nIt is important to understand that the OOM killer chooses between processes based on the “oom\\_score”. If you want to see the value for a specific process we can just read “/proc/\\[PID\\]/oom\\_score” - as shown in the screenshot below. If we want to alter the score we can do it using “/proc/\\[PID\\]/oom\\_score\\_adj” - as shown also in the screenshot below. The valid range is from 0 (never kill)  to 1000 (always kill), the lower the value is the lower is the probability the process will be killed. For more information please read [https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html).  \n\nIn the next post I am going to elaborate about the kernel thread “oom\\_reaper”. See you in my next post ;-)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g7p71pj7bj3a1.png?width=465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c835e9b3f47a2d14294a759a6bb2872df63fa21",

        "text": "**Some Background**\n\nMy friend and I started college this year. He is studying physical therapy and I, computer science. I have used Linux (mainly Ubuntu) for a few years on secondary machines (and on my steam deck if you count that).  So I have some experience with Linux, but my friend doesn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it was our first day of class, and my friend called me and told me that his laptop wasn't working. He had intro assignments due *that* night and needed to use his computer, as it was his only machine at that point. Well, for whatever reason, the windows install was borked, and he didn't have any important data, so I went to reinstall windows (from a USB stick). When doing this, I kept getting the error that the installer didn't have the right drivers to recognize his SSD. I could have futzed around with the drivers or installer and got it working, but because of the time crunch (and because I had a 20.04 installer USB drive already made), I chose to temporarily put Ubuntu on the laptop. Well, *that* installation went flawlessly, and he was up and going in 10 minutes. I told him that in the next few days, I would put windows back on his laptop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of days later, I asked him if he was ready for me to reload windows, and he said no. Keep in mind, we are students who use Microsoft Office products daily. My friend had got accustom to using those products in the browser, as well as the speed and ease of use that Ubuntu offered compared to windows on his lower end laptop. I was astounded by this, because now, 3  and a half months later, he is sticking with it. My friend is not very computer-literate, but everything was simple enough for it to work for him. I spoke with him yesterday about it, and he is still going strong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs someone who uses their computer a lot, when I have used Linux in the past, I was let down by how little of what I wanted to do, could be done natively. However, after seeing my friend use Linux successfully and actually prefer it, I am astounded by how well he is doing with it. I am honestly impressed by how far Linux has come and wanted to share my experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

        "text": "**Context**\nI'm trying out a 49\" ultrawide for a few weeks then I'll decide if I want to return it. Previously I was running on a 31\" 4k. \n\nI generally have Emacs up all the time, with browsers, terminals etc coming and going on the side.\n\nOn the 4k that winds up with the top left of the screen just far enough out that I have to turn my head to look straight on at my editor. I figured maybe an ultrawide would help (even though I'm giving up vertical space) since I could center Emacs and have two areas to the left and right for windows I look at less. This has been a mixed experience. I run Pop right now and generally keep it in tiling mode. It doesn't play nicely with this much resolution, I get oddly sized windows etc. I can manually adjust but that's what I try to avoid. I was thinking either switching to a wm that lets me define fixed zones in a way that will work a little better with this, or dividing the monitor into three virtual monitors. Which leads me to the question:\n\n**TLDR**\n\nI have a 49\" monitor (5120x1440). If I wanted to divide that into three virtual monitors left to right: 1280x1440, 2560x1440, 1280x1440...\n\n- Is xrandr my goto for that?\n- Why does xrandr want the size in mm as well? Seems like I'm opening myself up to rounding errors?\n- Is there a WM I could switch to that would be more appropriate?\n- What happens when Pop switches to Wayland (assuming I haven't move distros) I'm guessing xrandr is no longer an option at that point?\n- Is this stupid... should I return this and go back to the 4k (which mostly worked) or two 2k monitors? \n\nI realize I obsess over my workflow quite a bit...",
