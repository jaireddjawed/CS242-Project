I recently interviewed with a recruiter for an AppSec Engineer position at a large tech firm. Things went well, but unfortunately the position needed me to move across the country and I can’t at this time. So the recruiter introduced me to another recruiter in the same organization hiring a PSIRT (Product Security Incident Response Team) team member in my area.  Anyone have experience with being on working on these kinds teams? I’m more interested in a technical role in AppSec and everything I’ve seen makes these roles sound like a customer service job focused on triaging security issues to actual security engineers. ",

The only problem is in my testing environment that for it to work the victim has to manually navigate to the HTTP version of any given site, it does not automatically take them there. So with the exploit running, navigating to \"[https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com/)\" on the victim machine will have no effect however navigating to \"[http://www.example.com](https://www.example.com/)\" will allow for the HTTP version of the site to be displayed. Is there a tweak that can be done to force all HTTPS requests into HTTP requests? It was my understanding before testing that this was a built in function of the exploit however it does not work for me unless you manually navigate to a http page.\n\nAlso ignore whether or not the site is using HSTS as this issue persists on sites where HSTS or any other such protections are not in place.",

Well, you can also run it for Angular projects, if you have access to the source code. \n\nBut Angular is a client-side framework, meaning all the packages that are used need to be available client-side. So, in theory, couldn't you make a tool for pentesting that audits the packages client-side? I searched google, but couldn't find such a tool.",

We're gearing up to do more consulting and auditing beyond what we do now so we've got a few whitepapers to hand out that cover best practices and system awareness because the success of the system ultimately rests on the people interacting with it. This covers stuff like master key system design, key control, situational awareness, etc.  \n\n\nSo here's my question. From a NetSec perspective, what sort of low hanging fruit along these lines would you go after? Using strong passwords and phishing awareness are pretty obvious but what other topics should we be covering? These whitepapers will supplement a general security threat model that covers the most common threats to particular applications. I'm organizing this project and am competent to cover the physical but need to know what topics to seek expert advice on that I can't provide myself.\n\nThanks!",

It seems to flag every system file change.  They blamed our setup, but apparently they set it up. \n\nRetina has thousands of alerts for random cves that really don't apply to our environment or apply to the OS. For example version x of apache that they want isn't even supported on the OS version. It's simple CVE + Version matching. \n\nAre we poorly tuned, do these require a dedicated team, or do they just meet some auditors checkbox? ",

        "text": "I'm trying to detect meterpreter sessions from a network level using packet analysis with Bro, wireshark, and some other tools. I've been simulating attacks with windows VMs and capturing the associated traffic. I first used the staged reverse_https payload and noticed the SSL certificate was by default generated using dictionaries included in metasploit. I intended to use this SSL generation process to determine if a given certificate was likely created with metasploit. This idea works fine in the case of a reverse_https payload, but I'd like to detect other shells. I notice that [by default](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/about-meterpreter/#How_Meterpreter_Works) meterpreter uses encrypted communications. I've seen this line all over the place while researching but I can't find any more details. I figure that if this is the case there must be some sort of symmetric key exchange happening when the shell is created so that the attacker and victim machines can communicate without relying on plaintext. When I look at the packets generated by other shells such as reverse_tcp, reverse_http, etc. I don't notice an SSL/TLS handshake, but I also don't notice much plaintext communication. Is anyone able to describe how meterpreter uses encryption in these cases? I'd like to be able to detect most kinds of meterpreter shells from a network level, is this possible based on how meterpreter works or should I focus on looking at the distinguishing characteristics of the different payloads meterpreter provides?",

I've started the Masters degree programme, after a hiatus of +- 1 year, and I've half-finished the first year.\n\nThe problem is: I'm tired of law, and have been for a few years now (hence the hiatus). I'm very interested in IT and I've followed several Infosec blogs over the years, and from what I've studied so far (a bit of Java programming, a bit of networking), I really like it. I'd like to delve deeper into netsec and other branches of infosec and I actually know what to study and where to study it, as the resources are plenty, but non of these online sources provide me with a degree or any type of certainty. \n\nI live in a West-European country where the emphasis on having a diploma is pretty strong to get a job (they always ask either a Bachelor or a Masters degree in CS/Applied CS). Certifications are an option, but they aren't all that well known where I live and are considered more of an extra than an actual foot in the door. There is no transitional programme from a bachelor of Laws to a master of Cybersecurity, as far as I know. I've looked everywhere, even abroad, but most programmes require a foundation in Computer Science and a degree to prove it. It's possible to get a job in the field as a DPO, but that would require me to finish the Master of Laws and hope to get a chance to get a more technical job, as they all lead towards GDPR compliancy jobs. While my knowledge of the GDPR is fairly OK, I really would like to get a more technical job (i.e. pentesting).\n\nI've held off posting a new topic for a while now, but I'm hitting rock bottom when it comes to law (grades are fairly low to average and motivation is down the drain), so I hope I can gain some insight from people here who've gone through the same process, or perhaps a similar situation. I know that in the US the emphasis on a diploma to get a foothold in a security position is not as strong, but in Western Europe (or at least where I live), it is.\n\nTLDR: I'm stuck studying law and suck at it, except for the parts that are interesting for Infosec and that interest me (GDPR). I can't get a job in this field (i.e. DPO) because I don't have my Masters. I want to switch to a technical netsec/infosec job without any concrete technical knowledge in a West-European country that demands degrees for every job. What do?",

I've been thinking long and hard about what I want to do with my career. I've always wanted to do security because I find it freakin' fascinating and fun as heck to mess around with vulnerable VMs and such. Im a beginner, I only have about 4 years experience in a sysadmin type of role in hospitality where I got to learn ALOT of different technologies, and that is mostly where i built my skill set. While there I picked up the \"CompTia trifecta\" to try to land a gig in infosec/netsec and it worked out. I found that I liked studying for certs because it gives me a goal to achieve, and I learn alot of the basics on the respective topics from them. I'm now into 1 year and 5 or so months in an \"official\" infosec role at a different company where I am learning alot too, but no where near as fast or as much as my previous role. I decided early in the beginning of this role that I would tackle  other certs to build my foundation of security knowledge since learning on this job was pretty slow. I  tackled SSCP, eJPT, CISSP so far. I decided that I'd like to be a pentester because I love the offensive side of things I'm currently running through eWAPT and eCPPT by ELS and plan on going for OSCP sometime next year. \n\nSo now to the point of my useless biography, I've bee digging around for what pentesting gigs look like in my location (south florida) and I'm not seeing a lot of them. I was wondering, what are some job titles to look for that are more geared towards red team/ pentesting? I obviously have 0 real pentesting experience, but i've built myself a foundation on blue team side of things, firewalls, IDS, access provisioning, vulnerability mitigation and more... I've only been doing vulnhub vms and war games to learn linux as much as possible and the pentesting methodologies and I'm worried that I won't yet get picked up for at LEAST a junior pentester gig. I currently make 60k in my role in infosec. Is it feasible to ask for 70k when switching jobs? I'm not worried about letting anybody down, whatever I need to learn I stuff my head into it and don't pull out (giggity) until I learn it. \n\nTLDR; \n\nI'm a noob with a bunch of pieces of paper. SSCP, CISSP, eJPT, Comptia trifecta. Working on eWAPT, eCPPT, OSCP\n\nwhat are some job titles to look for that are more geared towards red team / pentesting?\n\nI currently make 60k in my role in infosec.

However, one of the questions they threw me was kind of odd, and I would like AskNetsec's thoughts about what they would have chosen for a response. The question was:\n\n\"A SIEM is a: \"\n\nWith answer options: IDS, IPS, Anti-virus, or Firewall\n\nMultiple answer selections were allowed.\n\nI won't reveal my answer, but I will say I'm not confident in it because I feel like a SIEM isn't directly one of these; rather, it works WITH all of them. Was the correct answer to select all of them, with the implication that a SIEM will implement all of these tools rather than be considered all of them? Or would you say it leans more towards one answer? Do you think maybe they were trying to check and see if I wouldn't select ANY of them?\n\nEdit: some formatting, I'm somewhat new to making posts",

A router recieves a datagram with TTL = 1. After decrementing the TTL, what will the router do?\"\n\nI've got 5 possible answers, but I know that it's either:\n\n    The router just discards the datagram.\n\n    The router discards the datagram and sends an ICMP message to the sender about TTL expiration.\n\nI think the 2nd one is correct. What would you say?\n\nThanks in advance!",
