But I never get enough pressure with the same setting. Anything above 10 gives me almost no pressure when pulling down the lever and 7 to 8 gives me about 5 bars which is merely enough for Flair.  \n\n\nI have tried thoroughly cleaning and recalibrating the grinder but noticed little difference. I am using using the tamper that comes with Flair58 without other distribution tool.  \n\n\nAnyone encounters similar issues or knows how to fix it?",

It was good, pretty light roast, nice tropical notes but I think I overextracted, because the fruit hid behind some bitterness until fully cooled. I'm going on vacation starting on the 19th. I'm totally willing to bring my grinder, v60, and even my kettle. I'm wondering if I should save the geisha for vacation and use up my medium dark roast beans now, or vice versa. I've heard that geishas tend to need more rest, especially light roasts, and the opposite for dark, so I'm leaning toward saving the geisha, but I don't want to let it go past its prime either.",

I was hoping you could help me.\n\nWhen I make coffee I use very cold water almost every time, 3-5 ¬∞C, as I've discovered it helps for an overall better taste. The coffee I use is Bonka (Nestle's) and i buy it already ground. I'm looking forward trying new brands and check if I prefer them.\n\nWhen I add the ground coffee to the filter I shake it gently to spread it evenly and avoid pressing it too much.\n\nI always wash the instrument after using it and usually while it's still hot. I use soap on the exterior and boiling water on the interior to avoid unpleasing flavors.\n\nHowever, sometimes the coffee tastes straight up bad and I don't know why. Maybe because sometimes the water is not cold enaugh? Because it's too cold?\n\nI also thought about the pressure I apply before spreading it, maybe I do it too hard or too softly sometimes.\n\nCan anyone suggest ideas? Thanks so much!",

I've been doing a lot of reading and found that recommendations are very different from the regular moka pot and after trying a number of different settings, but I'm not completely happy yet. My current setup is:\n\n120ml cold water  \n25g of coffee beans (medium roast)  \nGrind size set to around 115 clicks  \n800 watt on the induction hob\n\nIt takes around 2-2.5 minutes and I get 80-90g of coffee out with a bit of crema. If I go finer (like for a regular moka pot, for which Kingrinder recommends 60-90 clicks), I often get channeling. I don't do any tamping and have also tried using a coffee leveler. I will probably start using a bit more coffee (it's usually not filled to the top with 25g, depending on the bean it probably needs \\~10% more) and I could go even coarser and also use a WDT and an aeropress paper filter, but maybe others can report their settings to compare and I can save some beans from going to waste?\n\nWith darker roasts, I got what I think was a perfect extraction and a good amount of crema with very similar setting (but a good bit finer, maybe 100 clicks).

They are well-known for their brilliance, longevity, and value. Diamonds are available in a variety of shapes, sizes, and hues and are used in a variety of jewelry and fashion accessories.\n\nYou're in fortunate if you're looking for a [diamond gemstone for sale](https://www.bidsquare.com/category/loose-diamonds-and-gemstones-30). As a result of their exceptional beauty and worth, diamonds are among the most well-liked and sought-after gemstones in the world.\n\nIt's essential to take into account the four Cs when looking for a diamond gemstone for sale: carat weight, cut, color, and clarity. These elements will affect the diamond's worth and quality, so it's crucial to pick a stone that suits your requirements and preferences.\n\nThe size of the diamond is described by its carat weight, with larger stones typically being more expensive. The diamond's cut alludes to how it has been shaped and cut, which will have an impact on how it reflects light and appears to the eye. \n\nThe term \"color\" describes whether a diamond has color or not, with colorless diamonds being the most precious. Clarity is the absence of any flaws or imperfections in the diamond that could lower its worth.\n\nResearch is essential when looking for a diamond jewel for sale, and selecting a dependable vendor is crucial. A seller worth buying from will have a solid name and satisfied clients. A proof of authenticity and a thorough explanation of the diamond's characteristics should also be requested.\n\nA diamond gemstone for sale is a great purchase because it will remain beautiful and valuable for many years. You can make sure that you're buying a high-quality diamond that will be cherished for generations by keeping in mind the four Cs and dealing with a trustworthy seller.\n\nThe desire for gemstones as lucky or birthstones is another factor in the ring's rise in appeal. The fact that these gemstones are less costly than classic diamond rings is an additional benefit. Additionally, there is a stunning array of hues from which to choose.\n\n**Historical Significance of the Diamond Gemstone Ring**\n\nA band with three gemstones and a diamond is frequently found in a truffle setting. The ring has enormous historical importance because the Bible's Book of Exodus describes the Breastplate of Aaron as having numerous precious stones. \n\nGemstones like ruby, topaz, beryl, turquoise, sapphire, emerald, jacinth, agate, amethyst, chrysolite, onyx, and jasper are mentioned in the Bible. Additionally, the twelve gemstones represent the twelve Hebrew clans. These twelve stones eventually came to represent the twelve followers of Christ. It is still widely believed that wearing these gemstones will safeguard the wearer.\n\nGemstones were thought to have supernatural abilities by the Egyptians. Jasper was associated with rain, according to an interesting belief, and agates shielded you from spiders and lightning. The contradiction is that the Egyptians used gems as burial stones as well.\n\na diamond and gemstone ring with gemstones.\n\nA diamond gemstone ring may comprise any gemstones, depending on the budget and a buyer's preference.\n\n**Here are some of the most popular gemstones to dominate the market:**\n\n* **Rubies**: These are a part of the corundum family, which only has red rubies as \"members.\" Although rubies can be found in their native state, most are treated to make them more vibrant. Despite having less brilliance, rubies in ovals are incredibly popular. A highly desired present is a ring set with Burmese rubies.\n* **Blue sapphires**: Due to its exquisite hue and scarcity, a blue sapphire and diamond gemstone ring make a wonderful pairing.\n* **Opals**:Opals are non-crystalline forms of silica that develop in the crevices of the earth. They are given vivid hues by light diffraction. The most typical use for an opal band is as a birthstone.\n\n**Diamond Facts and Information**\n\nThere are many interesting facts and trivia attached to this magnificent gemstone.\n\n* The toughest gem known to man is that one.\n* One diamond can only polish and shape another diamond.\n* Over three-fourths of the diamonds that are mined are of industrial grade. This proportion, though, might differ from mine to mine.\n* These coarsely granular diamonds are known by the names ballas, carbonado, bort, etc. and are typically found in shades of grey to brown.\n* These inferior stones are typically used in glass cuts, drill bits, record player styli, and record player needles.\n* This magnificent stone was known to the Indians 2,300 years ago. However, they refrained from breaking or cutting it because they believed doing so would render it magically inert.\n\nIndia, Guyana, Borneo, Tanzania, Namibia, Sierra Leone, Congo, Brazil, Australia, Botswana, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Guinea, China, Canada, Ghana, South Africa, Russia, Angola, and Russia are a few of the current locations where this radiant beauty can be found.\n\nA diamond gemstone for sale is a great purchase because it will remain beautiful and valuable for many years. You can make sure that you're buying a high-quality diamond that will be cherished for generations by keeping in mind the four Cs and dealing with a trustworthy seller.",

I've eliminated it from my diet and I never eat out. The closest thing to safe eating out for me has been grabbing incredible espressos from my local third-wave shop. However, I suspect that even these have been regularly affecting me.\n\nPossible cross-contamination routes:\n\n\\- Cups are stored next to the cakes, pies and pastries -&gt; some traces of gluten land on them\n\n\\- If the portafilter, group head and hot water wand are wiped with the same wipes used for the pastries\n\n\\- Coffee beans could contain gluten (probably not in the good shops)\n\n\\- Cups aren't washed thoroughly enough, and contain traces of gluten from dishwasher, or oat-milk.\n\nThank you for sharing your experience!\n\nMatthieu",

After this happened, I adjusted the depth on my palm tamper to be a bit deeper, which has resolved it so far. (The weird part is, when I would tamp, tighten the filter, then remove it, there was no imprint from the brew head)\n* [I followed this video for my research and step-by-step](https://youtu.be/d0g8umpINGQ)\n\nI know that I should be tamping harder, and to get rid of sourness I should grind finer, but I'm concerned if I do those things, the extraction will be super slow. Pressure can't go much higher before it's outside of the range, and some shots are already around 27 seconds.\n\n  \nMy beans are quite old, but could it all be because of that? I used the same beans before I got this machine (a week or so before) and they were good.\n\nWhy do all the numbers seem correct, but the result is off?",

I figured it would be fun to try, since a close friend of mine roasts his own beans. \n\nI want to create a concentrated coffee mixture to freeze, than freeze dry. Since freeze Drying removes nearly all the water, a concentrated coffee mixture would produce a greater yield, at least in theory. My current brewing methods are a French press, aero press as well as a Moccamaster auto drip. What process should I use, or how should I go about this? I do know the French press leaves oils, and oils do not freeze dry well, but I'm unsure if the small amount of oil a French press leaves would make a difference\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "I try different kinds of coffee often but lately it has all been tasting the same to me when I brew it at home. \n\nFor example, I was at a coffee farm in Hawaii recently and when I tried the sample they gave me it was a memorable experience. I never had coffee like it before so I bought some beans to take home with me. I brewed my first cup at home and the taste was only *faintly* reminiscent of what I tried on the farm. I could taste the notes if I really concentrated but for the most part it just tasted like coffee I've had before where as the coffee I tried on the farm was totally unique.  \n\nI don't have the fanciest of set ups. I have an Oxo conical burr grinder, a digital scale, an electric kettle and a french press. I grind med-coarse (~9-10 on setting on my grinder) and brew in my press at a 1:11 ratio for 5 mins. Sometimes I will follow James Hoffman's french press method where you wait 4 mins, stir, skim off the crust and then wait another 4-5 mins before pouring. But most days I am too lazy\n\nIs there something I can do to get more flavor out of my cup without buying fancier equipment? When I first switched to the method I use now I was impressed by the flavors I could get but now it all seems samey. Maybe my palette has adjusted",

Since I don't know what she likes, I was thinking something that's appreciated by all coffee snobs. So, what do y'all like in common that's worth 10 bucks? Based in the UK, thanks.",

        "text": "(mini rant)\n\nI'm a couple months into trying to really learn more about making coffee at home.  I now have an AeroPress and a Switch as my main weapons.  I feel like I watched too many vids, and have a dozen of the top recipes for each method.\n\nbut the damm grind size problem...\n\nI'm using a zpresso JX S manual grinder.  I've got their useless picture chart, and I've been to many sites trying to make a little table comparing to other grinders so when some video says to use a XX on model YY I can try to get a good range for me.\n\nSadly, after months I feel like I'm still guessing.  I'm seeing a LOT of recipes calling for medium-fine.  But when a vid zooms in a bit on what they consider medium-fine, I feel like I'm seeing anything from fine to coarse!  For the love of me, I can't find a REAL REAL good set of SUPER high-quality pictures, let alone lock in where I should be.\n\nI know... trial and error.. still working on that part.  I've gone from hanging out around 2.0.0 on my JX to around 3.0.0 and up to 3.5.0 in the last couple of days.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm hampered by the problem that I simply do not know if what I'm tasting \\*is\\* sour..or bitter..or acidic, which means I could be adjusting the wrong way.  About all I can go with for now is \"doesn't taste right\" or \"how funny of a face am I making\"\n\nIn the meantime, I'm trying to stick with a single (recipe, bean, water temp, grind amount, water around, bottled water by suggestion in another post) to limit the variables until I lock in the correct grind size - then I'll work on the other variables.\n\nRecipe I'm using now is: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68ZOXrXbVHc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68ZOXrXbVHc) due to its simplicity &amp; positive reviews by people doing a lot better then me.  Can anyone tell me (more or less) exactly what # of clicks I should be using on my JX ?\n\nOH - one last thing - I do like the couple of recipes that try to tell you to nail in your ground by drain time at the end.  F'instance, in the vid I mention, he says the final drain should be about 45 seconds &amp; use that to adjust.  3.5.0 went too fast, and 3.0.0 was a bit fast as well.  So I'll probably just keep going down 0.1 and see if I hit a part where I start making funny faces - then go back up 0.1.\n\nPS - anyone have a real good guide/video on locking in the correct grind size?",
