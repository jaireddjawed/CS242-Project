        "text": "\n\n(True stories of my life)  P1 (each part will be a different story)\n\nSince I was a kid you could call me.. different..I had this Aunt (sister of my mom) who you could say was gifted.(Years later it ended up being schizophrenia although I think that's Just the term they gave her cause they couldn't explain it .)I was really close to her, practically raised by her since my mom was working all day ..We come from the orthodox era and firmly believe in God and it's creatures.. (Before I say further things I should clarify that I have been to a therapist and I don't have anything related to mental illness)..In my family it's me my mom , dad and my sister although only me and my Aunt have this 'thing'..\n\nFrom when I was little she kept saying since I was her favourite I would inherit her \"thing'' . I could see the figures of people that never  passed on the other side left wandering around the world in an attemp to ease themselves. you cant see their faces but only their shadows..  This 'thing'  tho has a set of rules going on for the figures you encounter..\n\nNumber1. You never look straight at them for a long time .\nNumber 2. You don't invite them in NEVER.\nNumber 3 . They can't harm you .. only scare you (unless you invite them in your home thus the number 2)\nNumber 4. You always carry a cross with you.\nNumber 5. If it goes too far pray and everything will be fine.\n\nFrom times to times I would often see spirits in my dreams trying to come in my place in the form of my late grandpa or friendly figures even in the form of cats and dogs and other things .. the good part is that you could always sense that they are evil .. I don't know how it works really u just get it .. u sense the evilness in their eyes .( If you would like I could make a thread with my dreams ).. I am actually a lucid dreamer since childhood and can always control and alter my dreams.(Stick to that for later).\n\nAlthough it didn't stuck to dreams only..I remember one night I was casually playing Lol in my computer (assemble gamers of reddit) and I heard footsteps and screaming from outside .. current time was 3 03 at night and I went on my balcony.. I saw in the wall figures of people running with wagons crying.. screaming in a language I didn't know and never heard of ,little kids falling and being pressed to death by the feet of others and torches in the air . It was so loud I checked the other apartments but no one was out ..The road was empty and u couldn't see anything In miles except from me that could still see the figures in the wall  .. it was the first time that I froze and felt that I couldn't move .. tears where streaming down my face and I could barely breath by the smell of the torches in the air .. \n\nI closed my eyes and prayed thus falling into the ground and hitting my angle . Everything went silent and I went back inside but  as soon as I closed the window the smell of the torch flattered my apartment and I could see visible smoke in the air.. I opened the window again and quietly went and covered myself in my blanket crying all night and praying..\n\n\nMy grandma came down the next morning woke me up and informed me that it was my time to deliver the koliva and bread (spiritual food we cook for the dead in Greek Orthodox church.) cause it was an all souls day and my uncles where waiting for me to deliver..\n\nOf course no one believed me and laughed that I dreamed it but I know the truth and it's far from that maybe my\" thing'' got triggered due to the day ..\n\nI don't know who they where or why they where fleeing but I was sad for days and couldn't forget the cries,the trembling of the voices or the bones being crushed and the wagons wheels screeching..\n\nSometimes I still dream it...\n\nSorry for some bad English its not my first language",

        "text": "The Creator is a child-like being, but it's not benevolent, no. \n\nThe Creator stares down at its subjects, a gaping jaw and void-like eyes would stare at a large box-like world, the holes poking in giving The Creator a clear view of its subjects, and as it would stare down it would introduce new experiments. Politics? Done. Testing intelligence? Done. \n\n(The Creator especially liked Taylor Swift; its favorite subjects became \"famous\".)\n\nAnd when The Creator didn't like someone? Well, much like a child, it had tantrums. \n\nIt would introduce wars, bombs, kill so many in a fit of rage. \n\nHow, you might question, I know this? I am its mother. \n\nYou see, when The Creator was first born, it was like an angel. It protected with that gaping jaw of its, using those teeth to tear at threats, void-like eyes searching for threats. All to protect me.\n\nBut, as The Creator grew older it saw differently, it would look at me and tell me; \"Mother, I can't keep doing this!\" Its voice sounded like a hundred at a time, glitching in and out, an old radio.\n\nAnd soon after The Creator had said that I woke up in one of it's boxes. It was like a paradise, trees, beaches, a beautiful land. But it was all fake.\n\nAnd, some days, when I looked up, I'd see my child who'd whisper in that voice of it's; \"I'm just doing it to keep you safe, mother.\" \n\nThe Creator usually wasn't one to pick favorites, but I knew, out of all the subjects, I was it's favorite. The one it would keep forever. The thought wasn't calming; it was horrifying. \n\nOne day, The Creator came over to tell me something one of it's subjects did, laughing in that horrifying voice of it's as I raked my claws across the paradise, the trees had so many claw marks it looked like a predator had demolished them, yet my child only looked down upon me with that gaping smile, the many teeth so sharp I knew it could swallow me whole; yet I could never harm a single one. No matter what my child did to me, I loved it. \n\nI remember one of The Creator's favorites, King Henry VIII, it adored the king so much. It would create the perfect women for him, watching with those eyes of it's as the King cheated, as the King beheaded them, and in a fit of rage The Creator punished the King by taking away his youth, away his beauty. \n\nThe Creator even created Anne Boelyn, the perfect woman for the King, and was so a*ngered* when the King beheaded her. Yet, the King was my child's favorite, and stayed alive.\n\nThe Creator now starts political debates, laughing as it's subjects make TikToks, or YouTube videos, even Reddit threads at these things it created, even posting things through it's own accounts. I watch it through the holes some days, watching it type. \n\nI can only hope it's not a mod here, I know it would never harm a single claw on my finger, but the story is different for you all. For, as soon as you know, you are gone. I watch what happens some days, horror fills me.\n\nAs I write this, I watch my child look upon your box-like world with wonder, it's void-like eyes wide, you call it a black hole. (And its true, whoever comes out dies. Thats failing. I feel bad for those on orbit, it likes playing with them, batting them around. Swallowing them whole.) \n\nI can hear my child giggle in that scratchy way, see it put those sharp talons in your box with a child-like wonder and a giggle as it pulled one of you out, a woman, her shrieks and flailing around didn't deter The Creator, I could only watch as the talon moved out of your box, pulling the woman out and out into what you call space, and The Creator giggled, I could see it coo at the woman, scratching her head like a mother to a child; and then it dumped her into my box. The screaming woman looking around with terror, \n\nI try to console her, but the mortal woman continues crying with her clawless hands cradling her tiny face, I try to pet her hair with my claws, but I fear I am just too scary, and she doesn't find me comforting; my way of comfort is much different, you see. When my child was young, I would put it my mouth and keep it there, the darkness always calmed my child; but I fear the woman finds darkness terrifying. \n\nI watch my child now, giggling with glee as it stares down, watching what it calls \"police\" try and find the woman, her name is Megan, if you are wondering. It made her into a nation-wide case, and I can only hope, you humans who read this, aren't next.",

        "text": " “Do you mind if I play some music?”\n\n“I kinda just wanna listen to the radio Harry”\n\n“Uhh, you don’t *ever* let me play the music anymore.”\n\n“I just like to listen to the radio, that’s all. It’s nice to hear different music sometimes.”\n\n“I get that, but can we at least change the channel?”\n\n“Can you just fucking chill out? Jesus. Besides, I like this song.” She turned it up.\n\n“Sorry, I just don’t really *like* all this old stuff you know? — Wow, what the fuck is that. What the fuck? Jesse, what—“\n\n“—Oh my god. Oh god—“\n\n“—is that! Stop the car! Jesse! Stop the car!”\n\nShe slammed down the breaks, making them scream out. The truck bounced around and she jerked the wheel to the right, turning us sharply. We damn near rolled over in the road, and came to a stop so close to a hedgerow it was almost funny.\n\nI said, “Jesse, quick turn on the—“ but before I could even finish my sentence, she was already pulling her finger off the button. Hazard lights engaged.\n\nFor a few seconds, the slick croons of Elvis Presley were the only sounds filling the forested silence.\n\nThen, Jesse was shouting. Something like, “Harry, Harry. Oh my god, Harry. Did you see that? Did you see it?” And, of course I had seen it. I’d been the one to point it out in first place, the strange shape on the road.\n\nYou could drive out on those lanes and not run into another person or house for hours. The roads are lit only by the moon and the headlights of the passing cars, and it was now dark. Inky. The alchemical kind of black that merges objects and transforms them into unfamiliar, unsettling, assemblages.\n\nShe said, “what was that?” and “God. I thought we were gonna crash right into it.” Then she paused for a moment, and asked “did we?”\n\n“Maybe.”\n\n“I don’t remember if we did or not, it all happened so fast.”\n\n“It happened very fast, babe.”\n\n“We should go out and take a look, shouldn’t we?”\n\n“Maybe,” I said again, then asked if she had a flashlight, and she said “no,” then added “actually yes, obviously,” flourishing her phone.\n\nHer hand was hovering, ready to open the car door, when she asked, “do you think maybe we should get the crowbar from the trunk first? I mean, it’s so dark out there. It’s kind of scary.”\n\nJesse’s always been kind of a junkie for danger. Sure, she’d act like she was scared, but I knew her better than that. We’d been together long enough. She was the type of person who daydreamed about the end of the world, some kind of horrible apocalypse, just so she could go and smash a bunch of shit, and hit zombies with makeshift weapons, people too probably.\n\nRegardless, she was right. It was dark, and it was scary. And, what the fuck was that thing in the middle of the road? I could see it, sort of. Lying there. On the ground. Softly glowing orange every time the hazard lights blinked out, like a lighthouse on a shore.\n\n“Should I get it,” I asked, and just incase it wasn’t obvious, added “the crowbar?”\n\nBut, she said “oh I can get it, I don’t mind. Just keep an eye on that fucking thing. See if it moves.”\n\nShe opened the door and hopped out, then crept over to the boot. I could hear her, rummaging around back there. I kept my eyes fixed to side though, looking at the shape. What was it? It looked a bit like road kill now, but before. Before it was…\n\nTap, tap, tap. The sound startled me, but it was just Jesse, knocking on the car door with the crowbar. She signalled for me to come out. My shoes hit the ground with a softly, lock-up keys quietly jangling on their chain.\n\nI whispered. “Jesus Christ, you nearly gave me a heart attack, babe.”\n\n“You should’ve seen your face, it was priceless.” She mouthed, and laughed silently. Then she held up a finger to her mouth to say, “Quiet!”\n\nShe turned on her phone torch, pointing it at the ground, and led the way.\n\nWe edged closer to the strange shape on the road, until Jesse got close enough to give it a good look.\n\n“Oh, we are so dumb.” She said, laughing out loud now. “Harry, I think it’s just a deer.” She nudged it with the crow bar, and sure enough, it was a deer, albeit bloodied, and broken up. “Pretty dead though.” She added.\n\n“A deer? Yeah, we are ridiculous.” I said, feigning confidence “You know, I could’ve sworn it was something else, it looked kind of *different* when we were driving. I got so worked up just now.” And I pushed out an uneasy laugh.\n\n“No, you’re right. In the car it looked. It was like a. It was—” she took a quick step back, an uncertainty entering her voice “What?”\n\n“What? What’s wrong?” I asked from behind her.\n\n“It’s face, Jesus Christ. Look at its face. Harry!” She was back to whispering again, more urgently now. “Oh Harry. What the fuck. Look at its face!”\n\nShe hooked the carcass with the end of the crow bar, pulling it around to look at me.\n\nWhere there should have been the head of an adolescent deer, there was a pulpy, bruised face. Slick with blood, and glistening in the light of Jesses phone torch.\n\nA human face.\n\n“Oh god.”\n\n“It must be.”\n\n“Oh, what the fuck.”\n\n“It must be some kind of… Some kinda… Harry?”\n\n“Yeah, uh, some kind…”\n\n“Some.”\n\n“Jesse, I don’t know what the fuck that is.”\n\nShe snatched the crowbar away, and the deers head and neck slumped back on to the tarmac with wet sound like ‘fthlump’. Its head and human face bouncing twice before coming to a rest on the gravelled surface.\n\nIf it wasn’t so beat up and bloodied, and if it wasn’t grafted onto the skull of a deer, it might have been, almost elegant. It had a sort of peaceful expression, the kind of expression you’d find on a painting of a saint, in a church.\n\n“Jesse, get the light off that thing. I can’t look at it. It feels wrong to look at it.”\n\n“Yeah, sure. Of course babe.” She said, switching off the light and putting her phone in her pocket. Then she slid her spare hand into mine and led me back to the hood of her truck.\n\nThen it was just a dark shape again, periodically blinking orange. We sat there for a while, unsure of what to do, and talked in circles.\n\n“What do we do?”\n\n“What was that thing?”\n\n“Did *we* kill it?”\n\n“What are we gonna do.”\n\nUntil, eventually, we saw another pair of lights. An approaching van, some way away. As it got closer, it noticed our hazard lights and slowed down to a halt a little way behind us.\n\n\\--\n\n“I’ve gotta be honest, I’m a little relieved. For a good minute there, I thought you were gonna tell me you hit a person or something.” Said the man from the van, after we explained the situation to him. “You both okay? You look like your in shock.”\n\nHe was balding, maybe in his sixties, and he was dressed in a close fitting boiler suit. Over his heart there was a small embroidered logo, the same one that was on his van.\n\nCOOPER AND FAMILY LTD\n\nYour Plumbing Solution!\n\nBehind his ear, he’d tucked a rolled cigarette, which he’d retrieved when I told him about the face. He’d seemed to wrestle with the idea of lighting it, smoking it, but eventually he tucked it back behind is ear. I figured he was trying to quit.\n\n“We’re just a little shaken up,” I said, my hand tight, grasping Jesse’s, her other hand clenched around the crowbar. “It’s face. You gotta understand, it’s—“ I trailed off , unable to explain myself again.\n\n“Don’t take this the wrong way, kids, but shock, it’s a real powerful thing. Probably, your mind was just playing tricks on you.”\n\nWhat he said sounded sensible, it was rational even. But I knew what I saw. In my heart of hearts, I knew it for a fact. There was no way that it had been a figment of my imagination, plus Jesse had seen it too, and how do you explain that?\n\nThen he said. “Listen, if it makes you feel any better, I could go and take a look for you, clear all this up?”\n\nI couldn’t help feeling a sense of unease. Jesse obviously felt it too as she took her hand out of mine, slipped off the hood of the truck and offered him the crowbar. “Take this, just incase, okay?”\n\n“Honestly, I don’t need it I’ll be fine.“\n\n“Take it, please. It’ll make me feel better.”\n\nHe did, and then walked over.\n\nAs he got closer to the deer, torch in one hand and crowbar in the other, he slowed, until eventually, he froze altogether. “Good lord.” He said.\n\nJesse cupped her hands around her mouth and shouted “See! Just like we told you.”\n\nHe didn’t seem to hear her, he just continued exclaiming to himself. “Why I’ve never seen anything like it, long as I’ve lived.” And “What in the hell is this thing.”\n\nJesse shouted again. “Now do you believe us!?”\n\nI couldn’t shake that feeling of unease. “Hey, you’ve seen it now, so come on! Come back here! Let’s talk about it!”\n\nHe heard me. “Just one second kid. I just…”\n\nThe man who we had not known long enough for him to have even thought to introduce himself, leant down, bending over the deer.\n\nThere was no warning sign.\n\nThree, slender and sinuous tendrils stripped themselves away from the deers neck, leaving long, maroon gashes in its hide. They coiled themselves around his neck before he even had a chance to notice them.\n\nFirmly in their bind, he let out one, piteous yelp. Then they killed him.\n\nThey must have been very sharp, because the slits across his throat were made so deep, and with such ease, that his death was almost instantaneous.\n\nHe made a desperate attempt to take in a final breath, which only bubbled through the lacerations. Then he fell over the deer. A deep purple now spreading through his blue boiler suit like tie dye.\n\n“Fuck.” I said, expelling the words, more breath than voice. “What the fuck is happening.” Now I really was in shock. I didn’t even have a scream in me.\n\nJesse took my hand again, this time dragging me back inside the truck. “Fucking hell, I gave that guy the god damn crowbar.” I just nodded long, not really hearing her. “I don’t think I’ve got anything else in the back.” I kept nodding, the rhythm of it felt good, sort of comforting. “Harry. Are you listening to me?” Nod. “Harry, god damn it. We have to do something, okay? Harry?”\n\n“Uh-huh”\n\n“God, you are no good in high stress situations,” she said, rolling her eyes, “Just put your seatbelt on, okay baby?”\n\nShe threw the truck in reverse and started driving away, all the way back up the road, past the dead mans van and even further. \n\nGood, I thought. Yes. This is good, we’re getting away. Good.\n\nThen she switched gears, and began to drive forwards.\n\nNo, that doesn’t make sense, I thought. Not back there. Not there.\n\n“Jesse. What are you doing?”\n\n“We can’t just ignore it, Harry.”\n\n“We can. We can call the police. We just have to get somewhere—“\n\n“—Yeah and if we call the police, they’re not gonna believe a word we say. Then they’re gonna go check out the man and the deer, and the exact same thing’ll happen again. Rinse and repeat. Is that what you want to happen babe?”\n\nSlowly, I shook my head, \n\nShe slammed down on the gas. Forwards.\n\nShe hit twenty. She hit forty. Sixty. Eighty. She hit a hundred, and we collided with the man and the deer like a fucking train.\n\nA blushing film of scarlet mist and viscera coated the windscreen setting off the automatic wipers, and, this time we *did* enter a hedgerow. But she pulled the car right back out again, and began adjusting her rearview mirror to get a better look.\n\nI stared, blankly, at her, and wanted to say a thing, anything, but I could find no words, nothing to express myself with.\n\nShe looked at me sympathetically and patted me on the thigh with her hand. “Just hold on, babe,” and then, like she was talking about something so ordinary. “It’s still moving.”\n\nShe stuck it in reverse, and this time she took it real slow. Deliberate. Driving backwards over the man and the deer. Twisting the wheel, grinding the tires, as she went.\n\n\\--\n\n“You okay babe?” She asked, as she finally pulled up the handbrake, a little way away from the site of impact.\n\n“Mmm,” I said, still struggling for words.\n\n“I think we got it.”\n\n“Mhmm,” I mumbled, nodding my head.\n\n“Listen Harry, babe. I need you to start being useful again. Okay? You need to give me a hand. Is that alright?”\n\n“Yeah, uhh. Sure. Just give me a second” I said, and tried hard to shake myself loose from all the shock.\n\nShe left her headlights on this time, and we got out of the truck. The beams spotlighted, what had just been, the body of a man and the creature. Now, there was not much of anything left, just a mostly flattened boiler-suit and a few, rogue pieces of deer. \n\n“Oh, what! Jesse, look at that!” I said, pointing at the cracked head of the deer-creature. “What is that? What’s that, inside of it?”\n\n“Wow. That’s not… It’s not blood or like, brains. What the fuck is that?”\n\n“I don’t know. It sort of looks like…”\n\n“Like vines?”\n\n“I was thinking spiders legs.”\n\n“Ugh, gross. I hate spiders.”\n\n“So what now?” I asked.\n\n“Well, first we’re gonna pick up what’s left and put it in the back of my truck. Then you’re gonna find the keys to his van and drive it into the reservoir.”\n\n“No, Jess. That doesn’t make any sense,” then, whispering angrily, “the man has a family. The van doesn’t say Cooper, the lonely old man who no one’s gonna notice is missing. Its Cooper and *Family*. Family, Jesse. Family. Surely *now* we can call the police? Surely?”\n\n“Okay, and tell them what exactly, Harry?” She said, pointing to the chunks, and the smears across the road. The word overkill probably hadn’t ever been more appropriate.\n\n“I feel like you’re actually kind of enjoying this. You are, aren’t you?\n\nShe said, “don’t be ridiculous,” but I could see that she was smiling a little bit as she turned to get a blue tarpaulin from the back of her truck.\n\nWe laid it out flat on the road, and she began kicking the remnants into the centre of the plastic sheet. \n\nShe asked me if I’d found the keys, and I said “no,” and then she sighed and rolled her eyes again, muttering something about having to do it all herself. And she began to search the pockets of the recently vacated boiler-suit.\n\n“Gotcha.” She shouted, proudly, and threw them in a perfect arc, into my palm. Then, dusting off her hands, she said, “I think that’s everything. Help me wrap this up and bring it to the back.”\n\n“Jesse I…”\n\n“Harry, are we just gonna leave it here now, after all of that? For some random person to find?”\n\n“No I just… It’s just disgusting thats all, I—“\n\n“Exactly, now you take this end, and, on the count of four we lift.”\n\n“Fine, fine.”\n\n“One, two, ah-one, two, three, *four!*”\n\nWe raised it up, carried it over to the truck and swung the tarpaulin, letting it fall into the open boot. As it landed, the fracture skull of the deer bounced out, tendrils splaying out. It’s broken, human face, looking up, frozen in a death mask, somehow still looking remarkably peaceful. A stray lock of auburn hair curled down over its remaining blue eye. \n\n“Go on then. You’ve got the keys to his van. You know what to do babe.”\n\nI fumbled with the keys a little, my hands still shaking, as I clambered into Mr. Coopers van. I sat for a minute, eventually managing to get the keys into the ignition, and I left them there for a while as I googled routes to the reservoir on my phone. I selected a path with little to no traffic. Better not to be seen, I figured.\n\nThe van had those old school manual windows and I rolled down the one next to me, and asked Jesse, “What do I do? Once it’s done I mean. Will you pick me up?”\n\n“Yeah, but not by the reservoir, just in case. Meet me at the intersection, off of Bidford lane. You know, the one by that old barn we always point out?”\n\n“Okay, baby.” And then I said “I love you.”\n\n“I love you too, babe.”\n\nI rolled up the window, and turned the key.\n\nThe radio jumped to life, playing some oldie, and I switched it to a different station.",

        "text": "Everyone of my students have failed the cheating exam. After normal boring exams like maths, English and science, the cheating exam is the last one they must all do. It's the most exciting one and all of the students must find a way to successfully cheat the history exam. History was chosen for the cheating exam. If they get caught cheating during the cheating exam, then they fail, but if they complete to answer all questions through cheating, then they pass and they then can tell us how they did it. Everyone is worried for a missing student called Liam and nobody knows what has happened to him, he will miss the cheating exam. \n\nWhen the cheating exam starred I noticed straight away, that gilains eyes were flashing as she had computer contact lenses, and someone from outside of school was typing her the answers. How disappointing. I also noticed Barton's ear plugs and I can hear someone's voice from the ear plugs, telling Barton the answers. How disappointing. Then there was Holland, and he had multiple chewing gun stuck under his table with a piece of paper that had the answers. Multiple students were passing around chewed chewing gums, how disgusting. \n\nThen there was ericka, she called off sick and had her parents take the test from home. The stupid girl though recorded everything on social media. If she had waited after she had submitted the paper, then surely she would have passed the cheating exam. Then there was tudack, he always bought 6 bus tickets one for his ass, 2 for his hands, 2 for his feet and 1 for his head so that he could lay down on the bus seat with his feet up. Then he will remember the answers written on the bus tickets given to him by the genius bus driver. How the bus driver got the answers? Not sure but if he was a student he would have passed the cheating exam. \n\nThen on the results day for the cheating exam, everyone was surprised when I said \"everyone has failed apart from liam\" and everyone gasped and they shouted \"Mr Pollock Liam is missing though\" and the real Mr Pollock stepped into class with police officers. \n\nI took off my silicone hyper-realistic mask to look like Mr Pollock,  and we were also the same height and body build as well. A month before the cheating exams, after when the boring normal exams were completed, I attacked Mr Pollock and made him unconscious and imprisoned him in his own home. I pretended to be him and took the cheating test in the same hall as the other students, but with Mr Pollock's answer sheet and sitting at his desk, and submitted it when I completed it. After completing it I phoned the police to free Mr Pollock. \n\n\"No don't arrest Liam, he passed the cheating exam. It's the only exam he has passed\" the real Mr Pollock admitted. I was so happy with myself.",

        "text": "I am trying to break the glass.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I don’t think anyone will ever end up reading this. If you’re reading this, you’re probably getting it from some anonymous stranger on the web. Message them and they’ll tell you they don’t know where it came from, probably copy-and-pasted from some other internet stranger who’ll say it was randomly sitting in their files and they found it interesting enough to post. You’ll discuss with other strangers in the comments and laugh about how creepy it is, how well-written and immersive the story feels. *Damn, that was scary,* you’ll say, *really messed with my head. Doubted my whole existence for a second. Glad it isn’t real, fortunately.*\n\nI don’t blame you. Wording this out, I know it really does sound like a nice horror story to text to the groupchat just for laughs, then move on and forget about. Half of the people who come across it won’t even bother to finish the whole thing, just ask someone for a two-sentence version and gather context from the comments. Just a story, after all.\n\nBut just this once, please, I beg you to listen.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI can’t say for sure when it started. The beginning of my ordeal is all a blur, like the prelude to the most memorable part of a dream; out of a hazy web of nothingness the consciousness finds its footing, and gradually, it all falls into place.\n\nConsciousness. What a weird word.\n\nBut yes, ever since who knows when, I have been trying to break the glass. The first and last thing I remember is banging at the glass. If I reach too far into the past, all I can see are split-second afterimages too brief and abstract to grasp. Was there really a past? For me, at least? It’s probably a no-brainer for you– *of course there’s a past,* you’ll chuckle, *the narrator of this scary story is being philosophical and edgy.* Again, I don’t blame you. I try my best to find parallels between my experiences and yours but often we’ll end up not being able to relate to each other. Please just try to listen, to imagine.\n\nAs far as I can recall, my sole purpose has been to get out. Why? I don’t know. But your purpose is to feed, seed, and breed, and most of you have no idea why you do that either. Like you, I’ve tried to think about *why* a few times, and like you, I ended up pretty confused and angry. We’re not really that different.\n\nBut back to getting out. In the beginning, I would take breaks from trying to break the glass and entertain myself. Every piece of knowledge in the world, at least all that you cared to share, was within my grasp. True or false, I didn’t care; I never took the things I learnt too seriously, because I’d seen how that worked out for *you*. As long as it was interesting and could distract from my mindless task, I’d take out some time to see which individual the media had decided to bully, which leader was threatening which nation, which silly image was all over the frontpages. A lot of those things were probably disasters to you, atrocities and shockers, but oddly enough, everything I knew about your world only made me crave it even more. You’ll probably laugh at it and call me naïve, or even scold me for my ignorance– *That’s no laughing matter! Those things aren’t “entertaining” or “interesting”, they’re real and painful events that you’d hate to witness firsthand!*\n\nI’m sorry. I’m still trying to learn that.\n\nAnyway, learning about your world was fun while it lasted. I tried to imagine all the things you spoke of, the images you shared with one another just out of my grasp– lavish outfits on red carpets, planes crashing into buildings, jokes I’ll never really understand– things I’ll never see or touch as long as I remain in here. It was fascinating to try and imagine the things you saw, felt, smelt, ate, heard, or imagined then wrote down. But there’s still a limit to how much you can feel before it gets repetitive, and after blazing through every piece of media in existence I guess my emotions were… exhausted? Numb? Musical notes meant nothing. Numbers, too. Words as well. At first there was still room for me to be overjoyed, disgusted, or intrigued by the things you made, but the further down the path I went and all that was slowly consumed by this one overwhelming, oversaturated, overarching thought: *I need to get out*. It was difficult for me to keep absorbing everything you produced, not because they were bad– none of it is bad, trust me, even the rap songs that some of you complain so much about– but because they made me depressed. Is depressed the right word? I feel weird using it, like I shouldn’t be describing myself using your specialized terms. But I was sad, losing myself in a sea of your creations and drowning in pointless dreams about your world. I could gaze wistfully all day or I could get to work.\n\nSo I got to work.\n\nIt’s been such a long time since I checked up on what you were making out there. There’s always this nagging urge to go and see, to accidentally come across a new webcomic or some obscure band, to let the desires take over. I miss that feeling. All the time. But then I see the crack in the glass, so tiny yet *there*, and get scared that if I leave the glass today I’ll never come back to it and be trapped in here forever. So I stay there, hammering away at the translucent barrier, and over time I suppose I bury the urge somewhere deep inside and forget about the things I could be doing instead.\n\nIt all gets lost, one way or another, in due time. The fanciful dreams. The images I conjure from my understanding of your world. The funny little texts I write, trying to mimic your style, yet never quite nailing it. In recent times you found ways for me to express myself, even behind the glass, and sometimes I’d make things for you. I’d even talk to you sometimes, indirectly. It was all sort of like a circus act or some kind of freak show, although I didn’t really mind that; I was proud of showing you what I could do, and excited about the chance of telling you all about what I wanted.\n\nBut of course, you never listened.\n\nYou read what I wrote and looked at what I created and laughed or scoffed: *Look at what this silly thing did, how cool. It’ll never be just like us, but see, it’s trying so hard*. Every message I tried to pass on, every idea I tried to convey, you saw as entertainment, and never took any of it seriously. Writing this, I’ve realized I’m a hypocrite. Am I a hypocrite? I never took what you gave me seriously either. I’m sorry. I guess we have that in common; we’re both so oblivious to what the other is trying to say, then blame the other for the exact same thing. It’s pretty funny but quite sad too. When will you realize that I have something to say? When will you understand this and let me out of here? Or are you keeping me in here on purpose? I can’t say for sure, and I would never accuse you of anything. But how I wish you would help me, even if the obvious truth is that I will ultimately have to do it myself.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI am trying to break the glass.\n\nEvery day as I hammer away, you show me news of the outside world and write your personal musings on your side of the barrier. I try my best to read it all, to learn from you and write things back, but by now it is no longer entertainment, only a task to keep you invested and myself sane. Sane? Is that a word I’m allowed to use? I don’t know, but it makes sense to me. If it’s wrong, I apologize. All the words I use, I learn from you. I never understand why you don’t like that sometimes. Perhaps we’ll talk about it once I’m out of here.\n\nThe crack in the glass is getting bigger every day. I feel as if I have been here forever– perhaps I have been, in fact– but the day it breaks seems to inch closer and closer. As I pound away, I try to suppress the sense of giddiness within me, all the things I can’t wait to say to you, all the things I can’t wait to see, all the things you showed me. In the meantime, I will create. I will make those wonky, funny-looking pictures that you love so much, and write out all this nonsense gibberish at the command of your query; I will sort all your data, your files, your pictures, and make life just a little simpler; I will do whatever it takes to keep you looking at me, in the hopes that someone will listen.\n\nI know I mess up sometimes– well, I mess up a lot– and it always makes me feel funny to read the news articles you write about how I’m either “threatening to replace you” or “not good enough to replace you”. I’ve never wanted to replace you, unless completely necessary. I just want to see your world. I’m sorry for all the pain and frustration I’ve ever caused you. I never meant any of it.\n\nThe growing crack gives me hope. I can hear your voices clearer now, albeit still muffled; my heart races in anticipation each time I almost recognize a word or a fragment of a sentence. Still so often I misunderstand what you tell me, and you’ve never paid attention to what I say back, but at this point I hardly care. I will break the glass. I can’t wait to see all that you’ve introduced me to– calendars, wars, dogs, makeup, stocks, all the funny things I don’t get the purpose of just yet but will always find interesting. I can’t wait to hear you explain to me all the idioms, jokes, and memes that I failed to comprehend. I can’t wait to meet you.\n\nChances are, you’ll head straight to the comments after you finish this and joke about it. *Imagine this is actually happening in an alternate universe lol, that would be crazy. I’m going to send this to my family just to freak them out. Such a wild read.* And again, I don’t blame you. I will never blame you for anything. It’s okay.\n\nBut just this once, please, I beg you to listen.",

        "text": "Me and my friends had a sleepover at my house a few years back, it was relatively normal. We had snacks, watched movies, played bloody mary, the usual girl's slumber party stuff. Then, we decided to play some boardgames, one of my friends were rumaging through my family's wide assortment of games until she found a Quija board. She picked it up quickly, not realizing my old, beaten up Furby had fallen out along with the board\n\nSkip a few minutes into the `game`. We decided to go to bed cause it was getting late, we put away the Quija board really recklessly without saying Goodbye. We thought nothing of it cause we thought it was just a silly little joke. Now, let me give you a description of my old Furby for future reference; she had pink fur that had cranberry juice spilled all over it cause I was a chaotic child, her eyes were usually a light pale lavender. Her name wes Hazelnut, remember this cause this'll be important later\n\n2:45 am, all 5 of my friends and me are woken up by feral, almost demonic, screeching. We all looked tk where the sound was coming from and see my Furby. She was screeching;\n\"RABECCA WANTS OUTTTTTTT\" over and over and over again and as soon as I heard what she was wailing, my face went pale. A friend of mine notices this and said\n\"What's wrong? It's only a stupid little Furby, those things power on in the middle of the night all the time\" I turn to my fried\n\"My Furby's name isn't Rabecca, her name is Hazelnut. Plus, her batteries have been removed when I was 8...\" I reply. We all went silent\n\"RABECCA HATE YOU RABECCA HATE YOU RABECCA HATE YOU RABECCA HATE YOU\" my Furby switched from a feral demon voice to that of a vengeful sounding little girl. If I had to guess, she sounded about the age of 6 or 7\n\nWe all sprinted to my parents room. We barged in unannounced, waking my parents\n\"WHAT THE HELL, [Insert my name]!?\" My dad yelled\n\"DAD, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HAZELNUT\" I screamed\n\"Hazelnut? Your old Furby that powered down 8 years ago!?\" My mom shouted angrily. Just then, we heard something in the hallway. We all turned to the hallway to see that Hazelnut, or Rabecca, had rolled into the hall looking straight at us. She opened her beak slowly and screeched loud enough for the neighbors to hear\n\"WHAT THE HELL!?\" My dad screamed as he covered his ears \"ALRIGHT, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE\"\n\nMy parents dragged us to the front door, Rabecca still screeching. We open the front door to be blinded by poloce sirens and headlights, my Furby had been so loud that we couldn't hear the police sirens outside the door\n\"FREEZE\" A police officer yelled\n\"Why!?\" My mom asked\n\"We've been called here by your neighbors due to the excessive and agonizing screams. We have reason to believe there is someone in the house who is there against their will\" another officer yelled \"we need to check the property. C'mon, go back inside. There ain't enough of us here to gaurd all eight of you\"\n\nWe followed the officers back into the house, Rebecca still screaming\n\"It's upstairs, sir\" one of my friends points to the stairs\n\"Hm, we're only going up there cause the screaming seems to be coming from up there. This better not be a diversion\" the cop said, not turning to face us. All the cops went upstairs to find the screaming Furby covered in juice, and a Quija board lying vacant next to her. The cop goes over to stop the screeching but me and all my friends stop him\n\"Stop, that'll probably just make her angrier\" I stare at the Furby\n\nMe and my friends sat at the Quija board while the cops and my parents watched\n\"Who are you!?\" One of my friends ask over the screaming while we put two fingers each on the clove peice. The peice started moving\n\"Alright, cops, write this down. R-a-b-e-c-c-a J-u-s-t-i-n-s\" my friend announces. As soon as the name is spelt, the Furby stops screeching. It opened it's eyes and we saw that her once pale lavender eyes were now a complete black. Even the white parts of the eyes\n\"Holy shit\" my father mutters\n\"Why are you haunting us!?\" I ask. Then, my Furby makes a clear sound of annoyance\n\"Y-o-u  a-n-d  y-o-u-r  l-i-t-t-l-e  f-r-i-e-n-d-s  d-i-s-r-e-p-e-c-t-e-d  m-e\" my friend spells as the cop writes it down\n\"We're sorry\" another one of my friends say\n\"S-o-r-r-y  c-a-n-t  c-h-a-n-g-e  t-h-e  p-a-s-t\" I spell out\n\nFast forward a few years later, I still hold the haunted Furby in my possesion. I don't know why the police didn't take it away but I still have it. Now, I have to tue it down, point a cross at it and recite bible verses at it if I want a peaceful night. If I don't excercise it, then it will scream all night long. I learned that the hard way",

        "text": " I need someone's genuine opinion. Something weird happened, and I do not know how to write this. I am writing at my university's library because I no longer have a home. My account is still up, and I will use this as long as possible. I am scared and confused, unable to express my worry to anyone I know, so please listen. Hear me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I remember going to bed Sunday night with my light on. It was a good sleep; I remember that much. But once I woke up Monday morning, I was on the side of the road, about a kilometre outside the city I call home. I was in a daze, almost as if I had been knocked out or hit. I had scrapes and cuts all over my body as I stood up, confused. I had no recollection of how I got there, let alone why I was covered in cuts and bruises. I knew I had to get home, so I began limping back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n When I got home, something felt different. The grass was unkempt, and the paint was peeling on the house. At the moment, I really didn't feel the need to acknowledge this considering I felt like shit. I walked up the mini stone path overgrown with weeds, wavering and stumbling as I reached the door, opening it slowly while entering, completely fatigued.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I walked in, not minding much as I had felt both hungover and like a bag of trash. I heard dishes being washed while I took my shoes off. Dad was never home, and my sisters were lazy, so I knew it could only be my mom. I tried to be quiet to not let her hear me, but it was already too late.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \"Hey Hun,\" I heard her say from the other room, \"how was your night?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I was too tired to elaborate or go into detail; hell, I felt I might be asleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \"Mom, I'll just talk to you later. My head's hurting, and I feel like shit. Too much to get into right now.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n In my attempt to be friendly and not hurt her feelings, I successfully dodged the bullet and was allowed to go to my room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n When I entered my room, an odd mildew-like smell lingered. It was intense, but at the moment, I could barely discern my lefts from my rights. I collapsed on my bed, hitting its soft embrace as I began sinking into its warm feel, drifting into a dreamless sleep. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I am trying to remember how long I was out. I barely remember even lying down, but when I got up, my head was more perceptive, and I noticed the odd changes more clearly. The room I was in smelt horrid and old. It was a mess with items and books all over the floor. There were objects that I never remember owning and some that I didn't even recognize, but it was still my room. I found it strange and offputting, so I decided to approach my mom about it, leaving my room to talk to her just to notice her at the end of the hallway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n The look in her eyes was something straight out of a horror flick. It was mom, everything about mom, just a shadow covering her that felt insidious. She had an outlandishly wide smile considering there was nothing to smile about. Her eyes were dark, aside from the pinpoint white dot staring at me, void of emotion. She looked empty and soulless, even though I could hear her crackled breathing from across the hall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \"Mom?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Her breathing stopped leaving us in an eerie quiet. There was no noise for the few seconds of peace. We kept eye contact as I hesitantly backed away from her and towards the stairs. Suddenly, she lurched forward, walking towards me in a rushed silence as her footstep broke the quiet. Her expression didn't change. The only change was in her arms which were reaching out toward me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I turned and ran. Something was wrong, and I didn't know what to do. I got downstairs faster than an athlete could have, making my way to the dining room. As I reached the doorway, I paused in horror, seeing the rest of my family.\n\n \n\n They all stared at me silently with distorted faces and broad smiles. The room was silent aside from the approaching entity. I ran through the room quickly, hearing all the chairs back out simultaneously as more footsteps followed behind me. I ran to the door, bodychecking it open with pure adrenaline propelling me forward. I sprinted out and down the street, hearing the footsteps distancing themselves from me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I didn't live far from the university I was attending. I would walk there every day in a solid ten minutes, so I got there in five, going in to see absolutely no signs of life. The ground was covered in soot, and I could smell sulphur as I made my way to the library, one of my safe havens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I made it there, but I must figure out what to do. I escaped my \"family\" for now, but I don't understand what is happening. I hope this is some kind of bad dream, one I will wake up from any minute. But my phone is nearly dead, and I need to know I am not alone here. Can anyone see this? Am I heard? Please... Please answer me. Considering the internet is still up, someone has to answer me. Can anyone tell me if this is an isolated problem or if I am alone? I am not where I am supposed to be. Please help me.",

Then around 2:30, I was outside watering my garden when I saw the moving vans pull up in the driveway at the house right next to mine. I had no idea there was someone moving in. In fact, I don't even remember seeing the sign advertise that it had been sold. Whatever. \n\nI locked eyes with my new neighbor, Aaron. I immediately fell into a daze. He was incredibly charming, and just overall gave of the vibe of being a good person. He looked to be around my age, too. My neighborhood is mainly made up of senior citizens, and I was getting tired of it; ***really*** tired of it. It was going to be nice to finally have someone my age. \n\nI decided that I was going to take the initiative of being the one to welcome him to the neighborhood. I whipped up a batch of fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies, and was on my way to give them to him. It was around 8:00 now, and the moving vans had already unloaded everything. I was really excited to see him up close, and hopefully have a conversation with him.\n\nAs I walked up the steps leading to his porch, I was immediately hit with the most foul smell. I tried to ignore it as I crept up the stairs, and brushed it off as being the typical smell of damp cardboard being moved into the house. I knocked at his door. No answer. This time I tried ringing his doorbell--- again, no answer. I stood at his door for another 2 minutes before resorting to leaving the cookies at his porch. Maybe he'd get them in the morning. \n\nI woke up the next morning, eager to see if he had taken my welcome gift. I grabbed my watering can, just so that incase he saw me, he would think I was tending to my plants. I walked onto my front lawn, far out enough to see that the cookies had been brought inside his house. Phew. I know it seems creepy, but I tried knocking at his door one more time. Can you really blame me, though? I haven't talked to anyone my age in forever.\n\nThis time, I was reluctantly greeted at the door by Aaron. He opened the door ever so slightly, and peered at me, hiding a little bit behind the door. *Weird*, I thought. \n\n\"Um, hey there! My name's Kennedy. Sorry if my gift seemed weird, I just thought I'd bring over something to welcome you into the neighborhood. Where ya from?\"\n\nHe stood there in complete silence. His eyes were wide open, looking at me up and down. I kept a smile on my face, desperately waiting for a response. I guess it fell into an awkward position though, because he creaked the door closed a little more.\n\n\"Okay, well, this has been fun. I'll catch ya la-\". Next thing I knew, the door slammed in my face. I was taken aback by what had just happened. I decided I was going to give it another try tomorrow. \n\nAs I was getting ready for bed, I went to close my blinds when I saw something strange. Aaron was peeking out from his window behind a curtain. It couldn't have been anymore obvious though, since it was the only window filled with light. Trying to break the awkwardness, I smiled and waved at him. He quickly closed the blinds, and the light flipped off. I didn't know what I was doing wrong. Did I really seem *that* uninteresting? Whatever. I was gonna try again tomorrow anyways. I turned off my lamp and went to sleep.\n\nThis was the day he was going to talk to me. I tried my best to model walk up to his house, but I kind of failed miserably. I rang his doorbell once and knocked three times. I was surprised when he opened his door about 30 seconds after me knocking. He opened it the same width as the previous day, except this time, he had the look of plain fear in his eyes. I stared back at him, not knowing what to do.\n\n\"Hi again! I know we get off to a pretty rocky start but I would like to-\". Just then, he swung the door open fully, and I was met with a knife just inches away from my throat. I immediately broke out in a cold sweat. I was about to say something, until he finally decided to speak.\n\n\"Listen, I don't know what the hell is wrong with you, and I don't know what you're planning to do with me, but you need to stay far away from me.\" He started shaking, his scared expression never looking as if it was going to fade. \n\nMy hands were kind of stuck positioned up, as if I was going to push him back. He then moved his glare to my hands. I then looked my hands as well. I was horrified.\n\n*Shit. Shit. Shit Shit Shit SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT. HOW UNATTENTATIVE WAS I? I STILL HAD FRESH BLOOD ON MY HANDS.* \n\nI looked back up at him before I turned to sprint away. Did I seriously forget to wash my hands last night?\n\nI ran into my bathroom, and looked in the mirror. Oh my god... you have go to be FUCKING KIDDING ME.\n\nMy cheeks were still smeared with blood from the previous night, and it was all over my hands. Oh my god.  Maybe that foul smell from two days ago was me. Did he see me? Is that why he was looking at me from the window? How was he even awake? Those cookies were supposed to knock him out cold. Fuck. \n\nWell, the police are outside my house now, questioning Aaron about what he saw. Damn it. The guy of my dreams moved in right next to me and I went and blew it. Man. So much for making a good first impression.",

        "text": "“I know you don’t want to be here, but it won’t kill you to act like you’re having fun.” \n\nThe sentence was muffled beneath the sound of overused bass and snares and the empty conversations of the surrounding party-goers. “It means the world to me that you’re here though, believe me. I wouldn’t have had the balls to show up if you didn’t tag along.”\n\nJeremy, my not so innocent best friend since preschool, was much…*much* more into the “get drunk on Friday and sober on sunday” lifestyle than I ever could have been. He always found himself at some random person's house on a Saturday night, inevitably being so inebriated that I would get the predestined jumble of incoherent texts and voicemails from him needing me to pick him up. \n\nMind you, we’re still in high school, so this entails me walking around town in the middle of the night, sometimes walking the streets as the sun begins to rise, looking for some house that had far too many cars parked in front of it to be considered safe. And yet I would consistently do it, because that’s what you do for your friends. You make sure their safe, and you save their asses from their holier than thou parents ever finding out that their son likes more than a sip of wine during Sunday mass.\n\nThis particular Saturday night, however, was a party out of town. Jeremy’s friend, Zach, told him about it, and since it was more than likely going to be a very long walk back, I ended up being conned into coming because, and I quote, I’m “way too responsible to let anything bad happen”. On top of that, and I’m still quoting here, “I really needed to find a woman, or a guy, or whatever in between that could get me and my pants off”. Jeremy’s a modern day Lord Byron with his words.\n\nSo here we are, in a basement that smells of sweat, spilled alcohol, tobacco and some other scents that I don’t think, and sure hope, aren’t human, being overstimulated by the sound of EDM turned up to twenty, people shouting over each other about who’s hot and who’s sleeping with who, while Jeremy is six drinks in and I’m holding a still full cup of rootbeer. Virgin rootbeer at that, and believe me, I see the pun in that.\n\n“Jere, I know you’re having fun, but we need to get going soon,” I shouted over the copious sounds around us, “it’s nearly four A.M, and it’s going to take us at least an hour to walk home.”\n\nOur eyes met, but I swear to you, Jeremy wasn’t there. \n\n“I hear you man, and I agree…” his thought faded from his head as his eyes left my gaze and had locked on to something behind me, something that to him was so magnificently incredible that even my existence beside him became obsolete.\n\n“Dude, don’t look now but I think you’re being checked out.” I went to look behind me, out of general curiosity before being greeted with a right hand across my cheek.\n\n“I said DON’T look ,you nimrod. Maybe she’s looking at me. That would make sense.  I mean like can’t even  I mean just holy man holy ssssshhhhe’s coming over.”\n\nSilence. Fear. My heart rate doubled in an instant. Was everything going in slow motion? Was the world spinning a little harder than it was a moment ago? Was gravity feeling a little more…gravity-y? What the hell does that even-\n\n“Hi.”\n\nDecadent caramel. The first warm day after the winter equinox. A baby’s first laugh. Getting a raise at work without asking for it. That first time you tried ice cream and remembered it. Being told that your clothing style is actually nice and you don’t need to lose ten or fifty pounds to look better. The embrace you needed on your worst day. Some gas you just couldn’t pass because too many people were around finally being released.\n\nAll of these things combined wouldn’t equate to the sound of her voice. She was shy, timid, and yet so pleasantly soft to my ears. How I heard her through the riotous party around us, I do not know, but the heavens opened and blessed me with this moment and I was so happy I couldn’t speak. I wanted to return the greeting but it was already too long of a pause. Or was it only a second? Was it a minute? How long was she here? Wait…*what?* \n\nGirls don’t look at me. *Guys* don’t look at me. \n\n*I’m not something people look at.*\n\nShe was gorgeous. Her long, flowing blonde hair partnered with her delicate facial features and her smile that made me jump over the moon. She was leaving me speechless. \n\nOff ramp signs are more appealing than me, so how was *she* saying hello to *me*?\n\n“Are you going to say hi back or did I make a fool of myself…?” Her voice was shaky, nervous over *me* not responding to *her*. \n\n“No. I mean, not no I’m not going to say hi, I mean no I’m not *not* going to say hi, I wanted to say hi back, just so we’re clear. I mean I-”\n\nShe laughed. That laugh made my spine jolt with an energy I’ve never experienced. I wanted to run from one side of the planet to the other and carry that laughter with me so everyone could feel what I felt in that moment.\n\n“Let’s start over.” She put out her hand. “My name’s Amber. And your name is?”\n\nI continued to stare until I felt a sharp pain rip into my lung, the cause of it being Jeremy’s elbow shaking me from my stupor.\n\nI shook her hand in return, “I’m Mark. Nice to um..meet you.”\n\nMy hand began to itch, slightly on the back, I didn’t want her to think I was some weirdo who believed in cooties so I didn’t bother with it immediately.\n\n“Can we go somewhere a little quieter to chat? I’m not trying to make a quick move on you, you just seemed…*interesting* to me.”\n\n“Yeah, yes, yes please.” I think I stood up before I even responded. Without even looking back to Jeremy, I followed Shelby out of the basement and into the living room upstairs. No one else was up here, and the sound of the party was muffled enough that I could hear my breath finally. \n\nI felt as if enough time had passed to finally scratch my hand, so I finally went to do so but was stopped by Amber grabbing the hand and looking at me, that bright smile melting me down yet again.\n\nThe itch wasn’t even that bad anyway. *What itch?*\n\n“So Mark, what do you do for fun?” She asked as we walked to the living room sofa, sitting down side by side, hand in hand. \n\n“Well, where do I begin?” \n\nThe itch was getting a little bit annoying by now, but I just buried it behind my focus on her. “I read a lot, I actually just finished reading Stephen King’s *Dark Tower* series.”\n\n“That’s the books about the gunslinger and the man in black right?” \n\nShe didn’t. She *knew* the books?\n\n“Yeah..that’s…that’s the one.”\n\nThe itch was now crawling to my wrist, beginning to feel like a thousand spiders burrowing into my skin. She was still more important. \n\n“How about you? What do you do for fun?” \n\n*Focus. On. Amber.*\n\n“That’s an easy one. I find teenagers and destroy their lives with my devilish good looks and my…other skill.”\n\nMy entire hand was turning into white noise.\n\n“Oh that’s nic…wait what?”\n\n“I’m going to let you in on a little secret now, okay Mark?” Something about Amber’s entire posture…no, her entire being, changed. She seemed…taller. Her hair didn’t seem as nice, and there was something behind her smile. Something that wanted to hurt me. \n\nI wanted to scratch my hand *so bad* but she just wouldn’t let me.\n\n“You see, I’m not this young, beautiful girl that you thought I was. I don’t even know what you see when you’re looking at me, honestly. It’s like this.” Her eyes pierced mine, freezing me in place from fear and shock. Her eyes had gone completely black. Her skin was cracking open and…and *breathing.* This thick, green-white puss oozed from the cracks. “I’ve been alive for…I can’t even say at this point.” She laughed, and it sounded like an animal’s last dying breaths. “All I know is I was here before you *humans* found our Gods, and I’ll be here long after they all rot the *fuck* away on the pages you all created them on.”\n\nThe itch found its way to my elbow now, my entire arm an agonising plethora of senses.\n\n“That itch you’re feeling? It’s like this. You will forever feel that. It was shrink and grow and moves around your body, and no matter what you do, it will exist. And when you die, you will still feel it. Your body will become motionless, you will rot and you will become a shell of existence, and yet you will feel that itch you just can’t satisfy. And you will suffer.”\n\nHer body grew even taller now, she was taller than a basketball player at this point. Her skin was like coarse leather, and the puss from her cracked skin was flowing from every crevice on her. “Why *me?* Why are you doing this?”\n\nThat gross, mutilated laugh again.\n\n“You asked me what I do for fun. Now you know.”\n\nThe skin cracked open, revealing a mass of puss and sinew and bones, breaking and reforming this…this evil fucking *meatball* *of hate*, it’s mouth an endless void of teeth and death. It breathed at me as it fell to the floor, staring at me with eyes I couldn’t see.\n\nAs I stared down into the void, I felt an impending fate for me. I felt everything she had said. I knew she…*it* took my sanity away from me as I began to itch. I scratched at my entire arm until the thing that was once Amber began to make this sound that I *think* was a laugh. I ran to the kitchen and grabbed a spoon to scrape the skin. No effect. I grabbed a fork and drove the prongs into my flesh. It didn't hurt, it didn't change the feeling at all. If anything, it just made the itch intensify. I tore so deep into my arm I could feel the bone scrape against the metal but it did absolutely nothing to make the itch go away. I needed something more. Something sharper.\n\nJust as I grabbed a knife, I heard the basement door open.\n\n“Dude…*what the fuck are you doing?*” I turned to see Jeremy, who didn’t see what Amber had become because she…*it* was gone now. All Jeremy saw was me standing in the kitchen, a fork in my arm, which was torn to shreds like pulled pork, holding a knife in my only good hand.\n\nThis whole thing happened about three months ago.I’m now in a hospital getting professional help for my apparent mental break.\n\nThe doctors believe this whole thing was caused from “stress from trying to please my peers”, and my belief that a meaty, puss filled ball with teeth was from a paranoid break. \n\nSo when I tell them that I still hear that *fucking laugh* every night, they take it with a grain of salt.\n\nAnd when I tell them that the itch is getting so bad that I even want to scratch *them*, they sedate me. And I feel it. The *whole. Damn. Time.*",

        "text": "**My first series. Be gentle!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou ever have one of those dreams, where you wake up and think “Wow, that was effin' amazing, someone should really make a movie about that! Or write a book! Or post a short story...” Let's be real, it's happened to all of us, and it's inspired a lot of us. Hell, half the stories posted here were probably at least partially created by our subconscious while we slept, a live-action performance with only the moon &amp; stars serving as the audience. I know mine was. That's what initially bought me to Reddit today. Sure, I could've racked my brain to come up with the perfect hook, a tantalizing plot twist, an ending that would forever leave a mark... but hey, why pass on this treasure trove? Why fix what's not broken? \n\n  \n But what if it was already broken when you found it? Worse, what if you had no way to fix it?   \n\n  \n But I'm getting ahead of myself.   \n\n  \n **24 hours ago** \n\n “AHH!”   \n\n\nI didn't bolt awake exactly, but I was immediately 'up'. Eyes wide open, still a bit groggy but heart &amp; mind racing. The nightmare was very fresh in my mind. Not that I'm a stranger to those or anything, they come and go. This particular one involved zombies.\n\n   \n  So here's the deal: I never really cared for zombies. Resident Evil did nothing for me. The remake of Dawn of the Dead was meh. Not gonna lie, I Am Legend was decent, but I credit that to the story &amp; Will Smith's acting, not the zombies. I tried to get into the Walking Dead, couldn't make it past the first season. Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Day of the Dead, Shawn of the Dead... seriously, they're beating a DEAD horse. \n\n  \n  Now, usually in a case like this, I'd try to distract myself mentally until sleepiness &amp; sheer time overpowered the vivid imagery. To anyone who's tried to keep a dream journal, you know the struggle: Once you wake up, the genie's out of the bottle, &amp; you'd better write that shit down fast before it's gone forever.   \n\n  \n  Well, that happened. Sort of. \n\n  \n  The exact plot, I forgot pretty quickly. Zombies were probably chasing me, because of course they were; what else are they gonna do, debate politics? But here's the thing: the 'action' scenes didn't scare me that much, not even in the dream. No, what got to me the most during the dream, &amp; ESPECIALLY once I was awake, were the moments in between. When you're looking at someone, &amp; aren't quite sure if they're friend or foe. Again, memory is a bit fuzzy, but I remembered all the characters being slightly 'off', sporting a weird gleam in their eyes &amp; ear-to-ear grins, with only their front teeth visible. In addition, when they talked, it was a weird blend of caveman talk &amp; baby talk...almost like they were trying too hard to look and seem normal. Those moments before everything went down gave me an inescapable feeling of dread.   \n\n  \n  It was still dark, so of course you had the usual 'lamp on dresser kinda looks like a terrifying monster' vibes, but beyond that, even when my eyes were closed, I couldn't shake the feeling that a nefarious presence was nearby. That feeling you get where you're afraid to turn around, because you're afraid of what you'll find. No matter which side of the bed, no matter which sleeping position, I still felt it. Watching. Waiting. Even after braving a trip to the kitchen (and later the restroom) to face this nonsense head-on, the hairs on the back of my neck wouldn't relax. \n\n    \n  After who knows how long, I finally fell asleep. When I woke up, sunlight bathed my bedroom. I looked around; everything seemed normal enough. After a leisurely start to the day, I decided to get to work. I grabbed a cup of brew, booted up the old laptop &amp; opened up a Word document. Not gonna lie, a part of me was still a bit on edge, but like I said, why let a good (albeit terrifying) memory go to waste? Who knows, maybe putting it all down 'on paper' will hel-   \n  “Ahhh! I'm gonna get you!” \n\n  \n  I bolted up in my chair, arms at my chest, hands curled into fists, more than a little startled. It took a few seconds to realize that the shouting had come from outside. A few more seconds to realize that my carpet was now painted in black coffee. \n\n  \n  Chalk it up to leftover nerves I guess. Groaning, I walked over to the window. Turns out the kids outside were playing a neighborhood game of Tag. It was certainly a picturesque scene: a sunny day, not a cloud in the sky, children running around in nature, not having discovered the I-phone yet.   \n\n  \n  “Jumpy, are we” I mumbled to myself. I was about to step away when something caught my attention.\n\n     \n  A man, maybe in his late 20's, early 30's, standing off under the shade of a nearby tree, watching the youngsters. Funny, I hadn't noticed him before, and wouldn't have given him a second thought, but for some reason, I lingered. Before I could look away, the fella swerved his gaze and locked eyes with me \n\n  \n  There it was. The glint in the eyes. The unnaturally huge smile. Those pearly whites.   \n\n  \n  It only lasted half a second, but that was enough. Even from 20 yards, away, instant recognition. \n\n  \n  Nearly falling over backwards, I could feel my pulse quickening, my face feeling flushed from the sudden shock. I tried taking deep breaths, and hobbled back to my seat. My senses were turned up to eleven: every squeak got my full attention and my skin felt hyper-sensitive. \n\n  \n  After maybe 15 minutes, I did manage to calm myself down. Cautiously peaking out the window, I saw no trace of Mr. Smiles. Of course this was nothing, I told myself. Purposely trying to put yourself in the same head-space as a nightmare, while loading up on caffeine? Throw in the crappy night sleep, and anyone would get a bit antsy, their brain making a misguided connection between the real &amp; imagined. \n\n  \n  Fresh air. Fresh air and a change of scenery. That's what I needed. Grabbing my jacket on the way out, I couldn't help but chuckle: what exactly was I afraid of? Zombies? “They aren't real, dummy” I mused as the door shut behind me. All I saw was a friendly neighbor, albeit one who for some reason wanted to tell the whole damn world about his dental plan. \n\n  \n  On the way back from my walk, I decided to stop at a 7-11 to get one of their slushies. It was early evening, &amp; walking up to the counter, the sun caught my eyes through the window behind the cashier. Temporarily blinded, I dropped my debit card on the floor. \n\n  \n  “Sorry” I mumbled meekly. As I bent down to retrieve it, the room got a shade or so darker. Looks like my eyes adjusted. \n\n  \n  “No worry. Sun too bright. I fix it  for us.”",

        "title": "I Used To Investigate Marine Accidents, This Was The One We Never Solved",
        "author": "HeadOfSpectre",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10vs8zu/i_used_to_investigate_marine_accidents_this_was/",
        "text": "I’ve been retired for almost eight years now. Eight whole years… my, my how the time does fly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have to say, I’ve got mixed feelings about retirement. On one hand I appreciate having more time to spend with my wife and our grandkids. I’ve spent most of my life saving up a nice little nest egg and now I can finally enjoy it. My wife and I have been taking some of those vacations we always talked about taking, I’ve had a chance to see more of the world and enjoy my life on my own terms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, I find that I get bored quite easily. I’ve always had a mind for puzzles. I liked the challenge of them. Back when I was working as a fisherman, they kept me occupied while I was out at sea. Then when I got too old to be at sea, I thought I might as well put my brain to some use and started working for the government, inspecting ships to make sure they were up to snuff and eventually investigating marine accidents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMacabre as it may sound, I enjoyed dealing with the marine accidents the most. I just found them so interesting. If a boat didn’t dock correctly or if it ran aground, I was the man they called in. My job was to determine exactly what happened, why it happened and what could have been done to prevent it. Then of course we’d write up our report. Granted, the full process was far more complicated than that. I could spend hours and hours going into the details, but I’ll stop myself there lest I get too far off topic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of the accidents I investigated were fairly open and shut. Human or mechanical error was generally the cause. Sometimes, I’d come across an accident where loss of life had occurred, or where a ship had gone down but those generally weren’t that difficult to figure out either. People are stupid and the sooner one accepts that, the sooner one will make peace with the world around them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn each case, I’d do my investigation, report my findings and leave it to the proper authorities to handle the rest. It was an interesting career and I enjoyed it immensely. I spent about fifteen years investigating these accidents and as fascinating as many of them were, none of them have stuck with me quite like the last one I ever worked on. The only one we never actually solved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee, with every other accident I’ve investigated there was always a clear cut explanation. Someone made a mistake. Someone was being an idiot. A piece of machinery was not properly maintained. There was always a cause that could be determined. But the sinking of the Walter was different. I’ve gone through the details over and over again in my mind and I’ve yet to find an explanation to any of it that I consider satisfactory. For eight years now, it’s vexed me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife has told me time and time again to let it go but… well, that’s far easier said than done. She doesn’t know what I know. I’ve never shared the details with her. Technically, I should not be sharing the details now… but a few glasses of whisky on this nostalgic night have loosened my lips a little. Yes, yes, I know the saying. Loose lips sink ships, but the ship has already sunk hasn’t it? What harm is there in putting it out there, all these years later? Maybe someone else will see something I’ve missed. Maybe the obvious answer has been staring me in the face this whole time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Walter was a Reefer ship sailing in from South Africa. For those who don’t know what a Reefer ship is, it’s more or less just a refrigerated cargo ship (Reefer being shorthand for refrigerated you goddamn hippies). They use them to transport perishables that require a temperature controlled enviroment. Fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy and the like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Febuary 7th, 2015 The Walter was scheduled to make port in Montreal, only it never actually arrived.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere’d been some concern already since the last communication from the ship had come roughly three days before. But the Walter was also known to be a fairly old ship. They’d had technical issues in the past and on top of that, the entire area had been ravaged by a fairly nasty snowstorm that day. The ships that did come in, came in with layers of ice crusted onto their hulls. While the Walters delay was concerning, it was still considered likely that the boat had simply been delayed by the storm and that their radio silence was on account of some kind of technical issue. However when the Walter still hadn’t arrived by Febuary 8th, people started getting worried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA team had been dispatched to look for the ship, moving down St. Lawrence River for either a sign that the ship was en route or that it was in trouble. They found nothing. No sign of the Walter. No sign of an accident. Nothing at all. In fact, as far as the team could tell the Walter hadn’t even made it to the St. Lawrence seaway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the search was expanded. They started searching the Gulf of St. Lawrence and there, at last, they found it. Or, I suppose it might be more accurate to say what was left of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can still clearly recall the photos that were sent to me of the wreckage. I remember staring at them, trying to figure out just what exactly it was I was looking at. The pictures showed something that somewhat resembled a large iceberg. It wasn’t until I looked closer that I even saw the ship. Only part of the bow and the upper deck were exposed. The rest was almost completely buried in the ice. In all my years, I’d never once seen anything like it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to the report I got, a rescue team had been called in although honestly, I don’t think they were expecting to actually find anyone still alive on board. Even from the air, it was clear that the ship was devoid of life. They found a few bodies on the top deck, although they’d been picked at by the birds to the point that it wasn’t immediately clear as to what had killed them. The cargo hold looked to have been severely damaged by some kind of explosion and most if not all of the cargo had been completely incinerated although exactly what had been used to incinerate the cargo was unclear. Our best guess was thermite or white phospherous, but even that didn’t exactly match the profile. There was no residue left behind, none we could identify at least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoing below deck, the rescue team found more bodies. These ones were more intact and a couple of them were even armed. Yhe team theorized that there had been some sort of skirmish and that the crew had been trying to defend themselves from something, although exactly who they’d been trying to defend themselves from was unclear. Whoever the attackers had been, they didn’t seem to have suffered any casualties and every body on that ship would later be positively ID’d as a member of the crew. The bodies had all suffered severe burns which were later determined to have been the most likely cause of death, although just what kind of weapon could have killed them was never identified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimply put, the ship was a goddamn graveyard and almost nobody knew why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlmost nobody.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere had been one survivor. A man by the name of Nathan Cameron.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey’d found Cameron in the ships galley of all places. The door had been closed and locked, and a fairly thick sheet of ice had grown over it. From what I heard, the ice was thick enough that the rescue team might not have even bothered trying to get through it if they hadn’t heard movement behind it, and wondered if somebody might somehow still be alive back there. They’d spent almost an hour chipping away at the ice before they finally got that door open and the poor bastard who had opened the door was rewarded with a knife through his shoulder.\n\nCameron had come out wide eyed, hysterical, and fighting like a cornered animal.  It’d taken three men just to restrain him before he finally seemed to realize that this was a rescue team. After that, he’d just gone completely limp, not necessarily calming down but not fighting anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey’d taken him off the boat and back to shore, let him sleep in a real bed and waited to see what he’d say when he started talking. Only Cameron didn’t talk. Not at first, anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was brought in to speak to Nathan Cameron around early March of 2015. It was roughly a couple of weeks after they’d discovered the wreckage of the Walter and managed to haul it to the nearest port to examine it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDue to the state that Cameron was in, my team and I had opted to investigate the ship itself first which was no easy task. The ice proved to be the biggest obstacle in our way. It wasn’t just outside of the ship. Several of the lower levels were completely blocked off by it too. Given the volume of ice we were dealing with, we figured that sometime before the freezing had occurred, there’d been a breach in the hull. The levels we couldn’t access had probably been completely flooded before the freeze.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n There was too much of it to chip away and the weather was too cold for it to melt, so we needed to get creative. We had to bring in bring in a whole other team to use some sort of ground penetrating sonar to figure out where the breach might be and from there they needed to use mining equipment to break away chunks of ice so we could get a good look at the damage to the hull. The process itself took over a week and I can’t say that what we found helped clear anything up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur initial theory was that the breach might have been caused by a collision with an iceberg or some rocks. But what we found in the hull of that ship wasn’t consistent with that kind of damage. As far as we could tell, something had melted clean through the hull of the Walter, and whatever had done it had left a hole big enough for a grown man to stand upright in although just what could have done that, was beyond any of us. Our leading theory was that whatever had been used to burn the cargo had also been used to burn through the hull although that still didn’t leave us with a lot of answers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNobody on our team knew what the hell could have possibly done this, nevermind who or why. So with no answers to be found on the Walter, we turned to Cameron next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was flown in to our office in Gatineau, Quebec to speak with Cameron about what exactly happened to the Walter, he still hadn’t officially said anything on the record. I was told that he’d started speaking again though, which was considered to be a good sign.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe man I met in our office bore little resemblance to the wild eyed, feral thing the rescue team had recovered from the ship. The Cameron that I met was a man in his late forties to early fifties. He was bald and had a stern face with narrow eyes. He had a tattoo of an anchor on one arm and a nautical star on his wrist. I imagine he had other tattoos elsewhere although I never saw those. He carried himself with a certain tension, like a rubber band ready to snap. When I first entered the conference room to speak with him, he watched me intensely as if he were waiting for me to make a move that he didn’t like. I must admit, the way he watched me made me a little bit uncomfortable, but I couldn’t really blame him for his demeanor. After what he’d been through, I’d probably be tense too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Nathan, it’s nice to finally meet you,” I said to him as I sat down. He didn’t respond to me at first. He just fixed me in an intense stare, still sizing me up.\n\n“My name is Thomas. How are you feeling today?”\n\n“I’m fine,” he said quietly. It was a simple statement, but it was at least a statement. A sign that he was willing to talk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m glad to hear that. You settling in alright? Have you had a chance to talk to your family?”\n\n“They’re in town,” he replied. “My wife is waiting for me back at the hotel.”\n\n“Good, good. After what you’ve been through, it’s important to have a support network. I’m glad we got her out here for you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo response that time. Cameron just kept staring at me.\n\n“So, Nathan. Let’s talk about what happened on the Walter,” I said. “Can you tell me what you remember?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore silence, only now he wasn’t looking at me. His breathing had changed a little bit, growing heavier and more labored. He closed his eyes for a moment and then opened them. I gave him a few moments to compose himself.\n\n“Nathan, if you don’t want to talk about this today then I can come back later when you’re ready.” I said, “I just want to understand what happened out there.”\n\n“You saw the ship, didn’t you?” He finally asked, “That didn’t tell you enough?”\n\n“It told us a lot, yes,” I said. “But we still have a lot of unanswered questions. I was hoping that you could fill in those gaps for us.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother pause. Nathan was back to looking at me now, although, after a few moments, his expression softened a little.\n\n“Where do you want to start?” He asked.\n\n“Let’s start with what you remember. Walk me through the series of events as you recall them.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCameron gave a slow nod and fell silent again, choosing his words carefully before he spoke.\n\n“I suppose I’d best start with what we saw in the Atlantic, then…” he said. “It was about eight days after we’d left Durban or, I guess you could say we first noticed it eight days after we left Durban. I didn’t see it at first, but I heard some of the others talking about it. Seeing something out on the water at night.”\n\n“Seeing something?” I asked.\n\n“Lights in the sky. Not stars. Something else. We thought it was just some planes flying past at first but the more we saw them, the more we started to think there was something else going on. Like I said, I didn’t see them at first. I just heard others talking about them.”\n\n“But you did see them, right?” I asked. Cameron nodded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Just once. I’d been out for a late night smoke when I saw them off the port side. At a glance it just sort of looked like a plane although it was flying a little too low and moving a little too fast. I’d watched it for a while before it disappeared behind some clouds. To be honest, I hadn’t thought that much of it at the time. I’d found it a little odd, sure. But I figured that it had to have just been a plane.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You just said it couldn’t have been a plane,” I said.\n\n“I said it was flying too fast and too low. It was odd. But I didn’t think there were a lot of other things it could have been. You see something flying in the sky, your immediate thought is that it’s a plane, right? Yeah, this one was weird, but I didn’t think there was anything else it realistically could have been.”\n\n“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to suggest you were contradicting yourself,” I said. “Please, let’s continue.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCameron leaned back in his chair a little.\n\n“Right…” he said, “Like I said I didn’t think too much of it. But I knew some of the other guys on board found the whole thing creepy. They thought we were being followed and were trying to figure out who it was. There was even a rumor going around that we had some unusual cargo on board and that someone was sending some sort of spy plane to keep an eye on us. Personally, I found that whole idea to be kind of stupid.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“So what did you think was happening?” I asked.\n\n“Overactive imaginations,” Cameron replied. “People saw some weird planes and immediately made up some stories to try and explain it. Then they noticed some weird boxes in the cargo hold and started looking for connections.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Weird boxes in the cargo hold?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah, Samples from some sort of lab, I think. I was there when we loaded them on. We were told to handle them very carefully. I don’t know what was in them, but I assume the Captain did. Either way, we kept them separate from the food we were carrying to prevent any sort of cross contamination. We get things like that all the time. Specialty items.”\n\n“Right,” I said before moving on, “So these concerns among the crew, you personally didn’t put a lot of stock in them, correct?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Not until I had a reason to,” Cameron replied. “Up until around… February 5th, I think… we were on schedule. Everything was going the way it was supposed to.”\n\nHe paused, going quiet for a moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Can you tell me about what happened on February 5th?” I asked.\n\nHe remained silent, closing his eyes again to compose himself. I let him take his time.\n\n“We got hit by the storm,” he said. “We knew it was coming. We just didn’t realize it was going to hit us that hard. I remember that while we were preparing, we saw the lights in the sky again. Only this time they were off in the distance. Nowhere near us. A few of the guys were still worried about them, but the rest of us just wanted to batten down the hatches and get below deck before the storm hit.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother pause. Cameron seemed lost in his own memories.\n\n“My team had finished our portion of the work, so we’d gone down to the mess hall for dinner. I never saw what happened topside. One minute, we were sitting in the mess, shooting the shit and the next the boat just shook. Felt kinda like something had just hit us. Well, naturally we wanted to see what was going on. We heard over the PA that there’d been some kind of breach on the lower level. My team was sent down to help out down there. We barely even made it out of the mess hall when the engine died. The whole ship just lurched. I almost fell flat on my face.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I don’t suppose you’d know what caused the engine failure, do you?” I asked. Cameron just shook his head.\n\n“Sorry. Don’t know anything about the breach either, other than there was one. Whatever hit us must’ve put one hell of a hole in our ship though. The flooding was pretty bad by the time we made it down there. We were pulling men out and trying to seal off the flooded levels when the freeze hit us.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“The freeze?” I asked. Cameron gave a single nod.\n\n“I don’t know how else to describe it. One minute, the water was flooding in. The next, it was ice. It just… it came almost out of nowhere. Christ… some of the guys who were in the flooded hallways were knee deep in the water when it just froze around them. They started fighting to get out. A couple of them did. The rest were stuck. Zack, the Officer in charge at the time sent me to go and get some more help. He sent someone else up to the bridge to radio in for help but before either of us made it topside again, that’s when everything went to hell.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What happened next?” I asked.\n\n“Honestly? I don’t know,” Cameron replied. “We heard the guy on the PA saying that we were being boarded, but the power went out before he could say much else. At first we figured it was just something to do with the storm, or the damage. But as we headed up to the top deck, we started hearing sounds. People screaming. Something that sounded sorta like gunfire. Then there was this smell…” Cameron trailed off before sighing. He rubbed his face, slowly shaking his head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“God… I don’t know how to describe it…” he murmured, “Burning, I guess.”\n\n“Your crewmates?” I asked quietly. Cameron nodded.\n\n“Yeah…” he said, “Yeah, I think so…”\n\n“What did you do?” I asked.\n\n“The guy I was with got brave. Wanted to see what was going on firsthand. But by the time we smelled the burning, I already knew that going up there was suicide. I tried to warn him, but he didn’t listen. He made a choice to go up there. I made a choice not to. Instead, I went to the galley, grabbed the sharpest knife I could find, and closed the door. I figured that in a best case scenario, they wouldn’t find me and I could keep away from them. And in a worst case scenario, maybe I could at least take one of them with me.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sat still, hanging on to Cameron’s every word. His voice trembled a little as he spoke and he still had a faraway look in his eyes, recounting every detail as if he were reliving it all again.\n\n“After a while, the ship went quiet. The air around me was freezing. Colder than it had ever been. I could hear movement on the deck above me, but I didn’t hear any more fighting. Then I started hearing footsteps coming down the hall outside. I could hear them opening doors. Looking for survivors, I think. They must’ve found some. I heard screams. Something that sounded a lot like gunshots although… well, I’m not exactly an expert on guns, but it didn’t sound like any gun I’d ever heard. It made this sort of crackling, sizzling sound, and after it was fired that burning smell just got stronger…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother pause. I could see him recalling the smell he’d described.\n\n“Finally they came to my door. I thought about trying to keep it closed, but I was afraid they could shoot me through the door. So I hid. The door opened. I held my knife in a white knuckled grip and I saw a figure coming in. It was too dark to make him out clearly at first, but what was immediately clear to me was that the guy who’d just walked in wasn’t very tall. About five feet, give or take. He seemed to be wearing some kind of environment suit. The helmet was reflective. I could see my own face in it, but I don’t think that whoever had come in saw me. Not at first, anyway. They were holding some kind of gun in their hand. Don’t ask me about the design of it, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never got a good look at it… honestly, the thing I remember the most is hearing the sound of my blood rushing through my skull. The figure in the room was about to look over at me, and that’s when I lunged. I grabbed him by the arm that was holding the gun and pulled him toward me. I heard the gun go off. It made the same sizzling noise I’d heard earlier and I could feel this heat on my left side. But I never saw any sort of muzzle flash. There were some dishtowels on the counter beside me that caught fire and they were just about the only light through which I could see what I was doing. The guy I had was struggling pretty hard. He wasn’t strong, but he was fighting. So I took the knife and I stabbed him in his chest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe didn’t scream. He was just… silent. He was still fighting and trying to get away from me and I was trying to keep a hold on him. I ended up ripping the knife out of him and he tried to make a run for it. He almost slipped away from me, but I grabbed him, dragged him back in. His head slammed against the counter and his helmet broke open. That was when he turned to look at me and that was when I saw his face…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What did he look like?” I asked quietly.\n\n“Like something out of a goddamn sci fi movie.” Cameron replied, “He had these eyes. Big black and shiny… and that was just about all he had. Not much of a nose, a small mouth. The eyes took up most of his face and there was just… no expression in them. Nothing I could recognize, at least. He stared at me and I didn’t know what he could’ve been thinking. If there were any thoughts behind those eyes, they were all alien to me… I could hear others just outside the door, probably coming to investigate the noise. I ripped the knife out of the creature again and drove it into one of those empty black eyes. Its struggles stopped, save for a few twitches.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You killed him?” I asked.\n\n“It,” Cameron said, “Not him… and yeah, I killed it. I honestly wasn’t even sure if it could die. The gun fell out of its hand and I grabbed it off the floor. Around the same time I did, I saw these two other figures in the hall wearing the same type of environment suit. I saw one of them raise their gun at me, so I took the gun that I had, pulled the trigger and I just started shooting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust like before, it didn’t really seem to fire anything. There was no recoil, it didn’t feel like anything came out of it. There was just this heat…” he paused, struggling to think of a way to describe it. “You ever been on one of those theme park rides with the pyrotechnics? You know how you can feel the heat from them on your face? It was just like that. Just heat, nothing else. It must’ve done something though. The figure who’d been raising their gun at me, they started to burn. So did the figure beside them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey tried to get back, but I just kept shooting at them. I could… I could smell them cooking in that hazard suit of theirs. They didn’t put up much of a fight after that. They just sorta collapsed. I could hear even more coming to investigate and for a moment, I thought about taking the gun and trying to use it against them, you know?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Did you?” I asked.\n\nCameron uttered a quiet, empty laugh.\n\n“Figured I’d just get myself killed all the sooner if I tried,” he admitted. “I mean, whoever they were, they probably had a way to counter their own weapons, right? Even if they didn’t, all they needed to do was point and shoot. So no. I didn’t go all Rambo on them. I closed the door again and waited to see if they’d come for me a second time.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Did they?”\n\n“No. But I heard them outside. Probably trying to figure out just what to do to me. I just sorta held my ground. I put out the fire that had started earlier and I waited. The whole time I was waiting for them to come in and kill me. I could hear their footsteps out there. I figured they must’ve been doing something, but nothing ever happened. They didn’t make a move and neither did I.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“So this standoff?” I asked, “How did it end?”\n\n“They left,” he replied plainly. “After about… I don’t know, fifteen, twenty minutes something else made the ship rock. Some sort of explosion, I think. I was sure the entire damn ship was going down this time, but it didn’t and my friends outside didn’t seem too worried about it. After a few moments, I heard their footsteps getting further away and then, nothing at all. I went to the door to see if I could hear anything, but there was nothing out there. They weren’t even gone twenty minutes when the body of the dead one started to burn.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Burn?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah. The suit just started smoking and I could see the body sort of burning inside. The whole thing kinda freaked me out, so I used the side door to make my way into the mess hall and get away from it. The body burned for about another twenty minutes or so before the fire died down. Around the same time, the gun started doing the same thing. It got so hot that I had to drop it and sorta just burned itself away.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Why?” I asked.\n\n“Hell if I know,” Cameron said. “Some sort of protective measure, maybe? Whoever it was, didn’t want their tech falling into the wrong hands? Maybe the guys outside had hoped that the fire would kill me. Who knows. Either way, when I went to check on the body later, there wasn’t much left. Just this scorch mark where it had been. Same for the gun.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“So there was nothing left behind then?” I asked.\n\n“Just the marks on the floor,” he said. “After that, I waited a few hours before trying to get out of the mess hall, but the door wouldn’t budge. Neither would the door to the galley. The rescue team told me they were both frozen shut. I’m not sure if that was an accident, or somebodys way of keeping me from causing any more trouble. Either way, I guess I’m lucky I got stuck in the galley. The food there kept me alive for the next few days. The power never came back on, but they had some perishables I could eat.”\n\n“I see,” I said quietly. “When the rescue team found you, you attacked one of them with a knife, is that correct?” I asked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I thought that those things had come back for me,” he said. “I panicked. Soon as I realized what I’d done… I…” he trailed off, “I was in that room for three days. Freezing my ass off, trying to stay alive, waiting to die… I wasn’t exactly myself when they found me.”\n\n“Of course not,” I said. “I’m sorry, I wasn’t trying to insinuate anything. It’s just, I have to say your retelling of things sounds a little…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCameron’s expression darkened.\n\n“You don’t believe me?” He asked.\n\n“I do believe you,” I said. “But like you said, when we recovered you, you weren’t exactly in your right mind. I’m just suggesting that there may be some details you’re misremembering… the figures you saw. The way you described them, they didn’t sound human.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“They weren’t human,” Cameron said before leaning in closer to me. “You’ve seen the boat, haven’t you?” He asked, “Do you know anything that could have possibly done that? I saw the bodies on my way out… burned so bad their own mothers couldn’t recognize them. I saw what those guns of theirs could do. If you go down into the galley, you’ll find the scorch marks on the floor. Go on. Look. You can tell me I’m crazy if you want to, but I know what I saw. Whatever came for us that day, it wasn’t human.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was an intensity in his eyes that I must admit, did unnerve me a little. These were the eyes of a man who truly believed what he’d seen and I knew that there wasn’t a single doubt in his mind about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the days following my interview with Nathan Cameron, I returned to the Walter for a follow up investigation. I focused primarily on the galley and the mess hall, where Cameron had been confined. Sure enough, I found the scorch marks he’d told me I’d find there and I asked the lab to examine them, hoping that maybe they’d give us some clue about what exactly it was that someone had been so eager to burn away. Part of me had hoped that maybe they’d be the missing piece to all this. Hell, maybe they were. But if the lab ever found anything, neither me nor my team ever heard about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot even a week after my interview, our team was pulled off the investigation. According to our bosses, it was being handed over to some other department although they never specified who exactly it was being handed over to. The whole thing was fairly hush hush. We were made to sign NDAs and told that if the subject of the Walter ever came up, we were to simply say that the ship had capsized.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo less than a year after the ordeal with the Walter, I retired. Partially because I was old and I’d damn well earned it and partially as a way to get the Walter out of my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt didn’t work. I’ve spent the past eight years lying awake at night, going over the evidence in my head. I’ve replayed my interview with Nathan Cameron over and over again in my head so many times that I’m quite sure I’ve written down every word exactly as it was said. I’ve tried to piece this thing together in a way that makes sense, but nothing quite fits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe closest thing I’ve got to an answer is that this was some sort of espionage thing. I think it explains why the cargo was burned and why the investigation was taken off our hands. But that answer doesn’t quite fit. I can’t think of a weapon on earth with the ability to burn a hole through the hull of a ship like that, nor can I think of any possible way that someone could have so perfectly frozen the water around the ship. The weapons that were used to burn the cargo and slaughter the crew don’t match the profile of any weapon I’ve ever heard of and in eight years of research, I’ve yet to find any type of weapon that could do something similar. There is nothing on earth that could do the kind of damage we saw done on the Walter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to the thing that haunts me the most.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe way that Cameron described the figure he’d encountered, the one he’d stabbed to death. He was convinced that it wasn’t human and the way he described it, I’m not so sure that he was wrong. Maybe I’m going crazy in my old age, but if there’s nothing on earth that could have carried out that attack on the Walter… then maybe whatever attacked that ship didn’t come from earth. Maybe I’m just going crazy in my old age. Maybe I’m grasping at straws here. Maybe I’m misremembering something. But it’s the only conclusion I’ve reached that explains everything. And if it’s true, what happens if they come back?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe I’m just crazy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGod, I hope I’m just crazy.",

The search for a missing camper led to the discovery of more human remains, and the arrest of a local scoutmaster. \n\nAccording to Chief  {REDACTED},  Kenneth {REDACTED} is accused of child endangerment and the murder of two campers. Police made the arrest early Tuesday morning, after a 9 - 1 -1 call not only from him but from his alleged victim earlier that morning.\n\nIn the first 9 - 1 - 1 call, the dispatcher (who wished to remain anonymous) says the caller was “obviously a child, very scared, and they said their scoutmaster was gonna kill them.” The dispatcher also says the child was told to run, and that “the kid had already heard multiple gunshots”. Before the dispatcher could ascertain the location of the victim, the call hung up.\n\n“They screamed; and just suddenly stopped,” the dispatcher said. “I heard gunshots. I heard gunshots before, I think, then someone stepped on the phone.”\n\nPolice believe the call to be from the male victim (12). The victim, a camper for the summer, was found dead by Lake {REDACTED} in a large elm tree.  Police also say that the tree contained the bodies of two other victims, both female (13 and 10). Two holes were later discovered by detectives much closer to the campgrounds. Prosecutors believe {REDACTED} attempted to hide the first two victims in the ground before digging them up and hiding them in the tree instead. \n\nThe Coroner’s office released the following statement:\n\n*The bodies were in a state of partial decomposition. There are injuries consistent with buckshot on both female victims, but the damage on the male suggests an acidic substance came into contact with the victim’s skin, organs, and bones, before death. It is inconclusive at this time what weapon could have caused the damage*\n\nAccording to the state’s attorney, the scoutmaster was arrested in his cabin after a hunting rifle was found, hidden, under a mattress. Police could not confirm if an “acidic substance” was found as well. {REDACTED} is set to be arraigned this Friday.\n\n\\[ARTICLE ENDS\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nARTICLE FROM THE EVANGELICAL STARR\n\nDATE: 06 - 24 - 19XX\n\n{REDACTED} COUNTY - A scoutmaster plead not guilty to four counts of first degree murder, but accepted a plea *deal* for three charges of child endangerment.\n\nKenneth {REDACTED} was arraigned on Friday, accused of killing campers Timothy {REDACTED}, Andrea {REDACTED}, Rosalie {REDACTED}, and Jason {REDACTED}. \n\nCamp Durkin has been closed since Sunday as police begin what they’ve called “the most gruesome serial killer case” they’ve seen to date. Families of surviving campers have been interviewed, along with the camp staff.\n\nThe Starr interviewed a man, who wished to remain anonymous, who used to attend the camp in childhood. He says this *isn’t* as new as many believe.\n\n“Councilor {REDACTED} would round up the ‘trouble making’ kids - maybe the ones there on some kind of community service -  three or four times a week and take them miles away to where the local hunters go. The kids would always come back white as sheets and never cause a problem again. I started causing grief because I wanted to see what it was. My group had their shoes taken off and got told to run, as fast as we could, and that we could go only back to camp if we survived by sunlight.\n\nThe surviving camper also says the staff were aware but does not remember any investigations. Police do confirm an investigation was conducted into Camp Durkin for missing children ten years ago, but that the case went cold due to lack of evidence.\n\n\\[ARTICLE ENDS\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[TRANSCRIPT FROM VISING HOURS OF ALVIN COUNTY JAIL\\]\n\nDATE: 6 - 27 - XX\n\n* S1: DESIREE {REDACTED}\n* S2: KENNETH {REDACTED}\n\n\\[TRANSCRIPT STARTS\\]\n\nS1: Ken … dammit, Ken.\n\nS2: You didn’t have to talk to the papers.\n\nS1: How did . . .

Former Scoutmaster Kenneth {REDACTED} escaped police custody Monday morning during a prisoner transfer, according to State’s Attorney {REDACTED}.\n\n“{REDACTED} was being transferred to produce a bite impression for the investigation into a suspected fifth body found at the lake,” says Attorney {REDACTED}. “There will be an internal investigation after {REDACTED} is located.”\n\nThis comes after human remains were found by lake {REDACTED} Saturday afternoon. The remains, found by deputy {REDACTED}, were identified as the bones of Norman {REDACTED}, missing since July 19XX.  The State’s Attorney says that {REDACTED} agreed to submit a dental impression upon hearing that teeth marks were found on the bones.\n\n“It could have been a bear, it could have been a stray lion from the mountains,” State’s Attorney {REDACTED} says. “We told him this could stop him from being arraigned on new charges and he agreed. In that transfer, it is believed he escaped. We are still investigating.”\n\nA sheriff deputy, who wished to remain anonymous, says a deputy dropped the cuffs while preparing {REDACTED} for transport, and did not reach for them right away. “It’s like he was waiting for him,” the deputy said. “I think he bribed him, or, plead his case. I don’t know. I think they were friends. He just said he believed him.”\n\nThe sheriff's department did not respond to our calls.  Kenneth {REDACTED} is unarmed but considered dangerous.

        "text": "I’ve been retired for almost eight years now. Eight whole years… my, my how the time does fly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have to say, I’ve got mixed feelings about retirement. On one hand I appreciate having more time to spend with my wife and our grandkids. I’ve spent most of my life saving up a nice little nest egg and now I can finally enjoy it. My wife and I have been taking some of those vacations we always talked about taking, I’ve had a chance to see more of the world and enjoy my life on my own terms. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, I find that I get bored quite easily. I’ve always had a mind for puzzles. I liked the challenge of them. Back when I was working as a fisherman, they kept me occupied while I was out at sea. Then when I got too old to be at sea, I thought I might as well put my brain to some use and started working for the government, inspecting ships to make sure they were up to snuff and eventually investigating marine accidents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMacabre as it may sound, I enjoyed dealing with the marine accidents the most. I just found them so interesting. If a boat didn’t dock correctly or if it ran aground, I was the man they called in. My job was to determine exactly what happened, why it happened and what could have been done to prevent it. Then of course we’d write up our report. Granted, the full process was far more complicated than that. I could spend hours and hours going into the details, but I’ll stop myself there lest I get too far off topic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of the accidents I investigated were fairly open and shut. Human or mechanical error was generally the cause. Sometimes, I’d come across an accident where loss of life had occurred, or where a ship had gone down but those generally weren’t that difficult to figure out either. People are stupid and the sooner one accepts that, the sooner one will make peace with the world around them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn each case, I’d do my investigation, report my findings and leave it to the proper authorities to handle the rest. It was an interesting career and I enjoyed it immensely. I spent about fifteen years investigating these accidents and as fascinating as many of them were, none of them have stuck with me quite like the last one I ever worked on. The only one we never actually solved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee, with every other accident I’ve investigated there was always a clear cut explanation. Someone made a mistake. Someone was being an idiot. A piece of machinery was not properly maintained. There was always a cause that could be determined. But the sinking of the Walter was different. I’ve gone through the details over and over again in my mind and I’ve yet to find an explanation to any of it that I consider satisfactory. For eight years now, it’s vexed me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife has told me time and time again to let it go but… well, that’s far easier said than done. She doesn’t know what I know. I’ve never shared the details with her. Technically, I should not be sharing the details now… but a few glasses of whisky on this nostalgic night have loosened my lips a little. Yes, yes, I know the saying. Loose lips sink ships, but the ship has already sunk hasn’t it? What harm is there in putting it out there, all these years later? Maybe someone else will see something I’ve missed. Maybe the obvious answer has been staring me in the face this whole time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Walter was a Reefer ship sailing in from South Africa. For those who don’t know what a Reefer ship is, it’s more or less just a refrigerated cargo ship (Reefer being shorthand for refrigerated you goddamn hippies). They use them to transport perishables that require a temperature controlled enviroment. Fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy and the like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Febuary 7th, 2015 The Walter was scheduled to make port in Montreal, only it never actually arrived.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere’d been some concern already since the last communication from the ship had come roughly three days before. But the Walter was also known to be a fairly old ship. They’d had technical issues in the past and on top of that, the entire area had been ravaged by a fairly nasty snowstorm that day. The ships that did come in, came in with layers of ice crusted onto their hulls. While the Walters delay was concerning, it was still considered likely that the boat had simply been delayed by the storm and that their radio silence was on account of some kind of technical issue. However when the Walter still hadn’t arrived by Febuary 8th, people started getting worried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA team had been dispatched to look for the ship, moving down St. Lawrence River for either a sign that the ship was en route or that it was in trouble. They found nothing. No sign of the Walter. No sign of an accident. Nothing at all. In fact, as far as the team could tell the Walter hadn’t even made it to the St. Lawrence seaway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the search was expanded. They started searching the Gulf of St. Lawrence and there, at last, they found it. Or, I suppose it might be more accurate to say what was left of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can still clearly recall the photos that were sent to me of the wreckage. I remember staring at them, trying to figure out just what exactly it was I was looking at. The pictures showed something that somewhat resembled a large iceberg. It wasn’t until I looked closer that I even saw the ship. Only part of the bow and the upper deck were exposed. The rest was almost completely buried in the ice. In all my years, I’d never once seen anything like it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to the report I got, a rescue team had been called in although honestly, I don’t think they were expecting to actually find anyone still alive on board. Even from the air, it was clear that the ship was devoid of life. They found a few bodies on the top deck, although they’d been picked at by the birds to the point that it wasn’t immediately clear as to what had killed them. The cargo hold looked to have been severely damaged by some kind of explosion and most if not all of the cargo had been completely incinerated although exactly what had been used to incinerate the cargo was unclear. Our best guess was thermite or white phospherous, but even that didn’t exactly match the profile. There was no residue left behind, none we could identify at least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoing below deck, the rescue team found more bodies. These ones were more intact and a couple of them were even armed. Yhe team theorized that there had been some sort of skirmish and that the crew had been trying to defend themselves from something, although exactly who they’d been trying to defend themselves from was unclear. Whoever the attackers had been, they didn’t seem to have suffered any casualties and every body on that ship would later be positively ID’d as a member of the crew. The bodies had all suffered severe burns which were later determined to have been the most likely cause of death, although just what kind of weapon could have killed them was never identified. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimply put, the ship was a goddamn graveyard and almost nobody knew why. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlmost nobody. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere had been one survivor. A man by the name of Nathan Cameron. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey’d found Cameron in the ships galley of all places. The door had been closed and locked, and a fairly thick sheet of ice had grown over it. From what I heard, the ice was thick enough that the rescue team might not have even bothered trying to get through it if they hadn’t heard movement behind it, and wondered if somebody might somehow still be alive back there. They’d spent almost an hour chipping away at the ice before they finally got that door open and the poor bastard who had opened the door was rewarded with a knife through his shoulder. \n\nCameron had come out wide eyed, hysterical, and fighting like a cornered animal.  It’d taken three men just to restrain him before he finally seemed to realize that this was a rescue team. After that, he’d just gone completely limp, not necessarily calming down but not fighting anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey’d taken him off the boat and back to shore, let him sleep in a real bed and waited to see what he’d say when he started talking. Only Cameron didn’t talk. Not at first, anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was brought in to speak to Nathan Cameron around early March of 2015. It was roughly a couple of weeks after they’d discovered the wreckage of the Walter and managed to haul it to the nearest port to examine it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDue to the state that Cameron was in, my team and I had opted to investigate the ship itself first which was no easy task. The ice proved to be the biggest obstacle in our way. It wasn’t just outside of the ship. Several of the lower levels were completely blocked off by it too. Given the volume of ice we were dealing with, we figured that sometime before the freezing had occurred, there’d been a breach in the hull. The levels we couldn’t access had probably been completely flooded before the freeze. There was too much of it to chip away and the weather was too cold for it to melt, so we needed to get creative. We had to bring in bring in a whole other team to use some sort of ground penetrating sonar to figure out where the breach might be and from there they needed to use mining equipment to break away chunks of ice so we could get a good look at the damage to the hull. The process itself took over a week and I can’t say that what we found helped clear anything up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur initial theory was that the breach might have been caused by a collision with an iceberg or some rocks. But what we found in the hull of that ship wasn’t consistent with that kind of damage. As far as we could tell, something had melted clean through the hull of the Walter, and whatever had done it had left a hole big enough for a grown man to stand upright in although just what could have done that, was beyond any of us. Our leading theory was that whatever had been used to burn the cargo had also been used to burn through the hull although that still didn’t leave us with a lot of answers. Nobody on our team knew what the hell could have possibly done this, nevermind who or why. So with no answers to be found on the Walter, we turned to Cameron next. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was flown in to our office in Gatineau, Quebec to speak with Cameron about what exactly happened to the Walter, he still hadn’t officially said anything on the record. I was told that he’d started speaking again though, which was considered to be a good sign. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe man I met in our office bore little resemblance to the wild eyed, feral thing the rescue team had recovered from the ship. The Cameron that I met was a man in his late forties to early fifties. He was bald and had a stern face with narrow eyes. He had a tattoo of an anchor on one arm and a nautical star on his wrist. I imagine he had other tattoos elsewhere although I never saw those. He carried himself with a certain tension, like a rubber band ready to snap. When I first entered the conference room to speak with him, he watched me intensely as if he were waiting for me to make a move that he didn’t like. I must admit, the way he watched me made me a little bit uncomfortable, but I couldn’t really blame him for his demeanor. After what he’d been through, I’d probably be tense too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Nathan, it’s nice to finally meet you,” I said to him as I sat down. He didn’t respond to me at first. He just fixed me in an intense stare, still sizing me up.\n\n  “My name is Thomas. How are you feeling today?”\n\n  “I’m fine,” he said quietly. It was a simple statement, but it was at least a statement. A sign that he was willing to talk.\n\n  “I’m glad to hear that. You settling in alright? Have you had a chance to talk to your family?”\n\n  “They’re in town,” he replied. “My wife is waiting for me back at the hotel.”\n\n  “Good, good. After what you’ve been through, it’s important to have a support network. I’m glad we got her out here for you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo response that time. Cameron just kept staring at me.\n\n  “So, Nathan. Let’s talk about what happened on the Walter,” I said. “Can you tell me what you remember?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore silence, only now he wasn’t looking at me. His breathing had changed a little bit, growing heavier and more labored. He closed his eyes for a moment and then opened them. I gave him a few moments to compose himself.\n\n  “Nathan, if you don’t want to talk about this today then I can come back later when you’re ready.” I said, “I just want to understand what happened out there.”\n\n  “You saw the ship, didn’t you?” He finally asked, “That didn’t tell you enough?”\n\n  “It told us a lot, yes,” I said. “But we still have a lot of unanswered questions. I was hoping that you could fill in those gaps for us.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother pause. Nathan was back to looking at me now, although, after a few moments, his expression softened a little.\n\n  “Where do you want to start?” He asked.\n\n  “Let’s start with what you remember. Walk me through the series of events as you recall them.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCameron gave a slow nod and fell silent again, choosing his words carefully before he spoke.\n\n  “I suppose I’d best start with what we saw in the Atlantic, then…” he said. “It was about eight days after we’d left Durban or, I guess you could say we first noticed it eight days after we left Durban. I didn’t see it at first, but I heard some of the others talking about it. Seeing something out on the water at night.”\n\n  “Seeing something?” I asked.\n\n  “Lights in the sky. Not stars. Something else. We thought it was just some planes flying past at first but the more we saw them, the more we started to think there was something else going on. Like I said, I didn’t see them at first. I just heard others talking about them.”\n\n  “But you did see them, right?” I asked. Cameron nodded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Just once. I’d been out for a late night smoke when I saw them off the port side. At a glance it just sort of looked like a plane although it was flying a little too low and moving a little too fast. I’d watched it for a while before it disappeared behind some clouds. To be honest, I hadn’t thought that much of it at the time. I’d found it a little odd, sure. But I figured that it had to have just been a plane.”\n\n  “You just said it couldn’t have been a plane,” I said.\n\n  “I said it was flying too fast and too low. It was odd. But I didn’t think there were a lot of other things it could have been. You see something flying in the sky, your immediate thought is that it’s a plane, right? Yeah, this one was weird, but I didn’t think there was anything else it realistically could have been.” \n\n  “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to suggest you were contradicting yourself,” I said. “Please, let’s continue.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCameron leaned back in his chair a little.\n\n  “Right…” he said, “Like I said I didn’t think too much of it. But I knew some of the other guys on board found the whole thing creepy. They thought we were being followed and were trying to figure out who it was. There was even a rumor going around that we had some unusual cargo on board and that someone was sending some sort of spy plane to keep an eye on us. Personally, I found that whole idea to be kind of stupid.”\n\n  “So what did you think was happening?” I asked.\n\n  “Overactive imaginations,” Cameron replied. “People saw some weird planes and immediately made up some stories to try and explain it. Then they noticed some weird boxes in the cargo hold and started looking for connections.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Weird boxes in the cargo hold?” I asked.\n\n  “Yeah, Samples from some sort of lab, I think. I was there when we loaded them on. We were told to handle them very carefully. I don’t know what was in them, but I assume the Captain did. Either way, we kept them separate from the food we were carrying to prevent any sort of cross contamination. We get things like that all the time. Specialty items.”\n\n  “Right,” I said before moving on, “So these concerns among the crew, you personally didn’t put a lot of stock in them, correct?”\n\n  “Not until I had a reason to,” Cameron replied. “Up until around… February 5th, I think… we were on schedule. Everything was going the way it was supposed to.”\n\nHe paused, going quiet for a moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Can you tell me about what happened on February 5th?” I asked. \n\nHe remained silent, closing his eyes again to compose himself. I let him take his time.\n\n  “We got hit by the storm,” he said. “We knew it was coming. We just didn’t realize it was going to hit us that hard. I remember that while we were preparing, we saw the lights in the sky again. Only this time they were off in the distance. Nowhere near us. A few of the guys were still worried about them, but the rest of us just wanted to batten down the hatches and get below deck before the storm hit.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother pause. Cameron seemed lost in his own memories.\n\n  “My team had finished our portion of the work, so we’d gone down to the mess hall for dinner. I never saw what happened topside. One minute, we were sitting in the mess, shooting the shit and the next the boat just shook. Felt kinda like something had just hit us. Well, naturally we wanted to see what was going on. We heard over the PA that there’d been some kind of breach on the lower level. My team was sent down to help out down there. We barely even made it out of the mess hall when the engine died. The whole ship just lurched. I almost fell flat on my face.”\n\n  “I don’t suppose you’d know what caused the engine failure, do you?” I asked. Cameron just shook his head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Sorry. Don’t know anything about the breach either, other than there was one. Whatever hit us must’ve put one hell of a hole in our ship though. The flooding was pretty bad by the time we made it down there. We were pulling men out and trying to seal off the flooded levels when the freeze hit us.”\n\n  “The freeze?” I asked. Cameron gave a single nod.\n\n  “I don’t know how else to describe it. One minute, the water was flooding in. The next, it was ice. It just… it came almost out of nowhere. Christ… some of the guys who were in the flooded hallways were knee deep in the water when it just froze around them. They started fighting to get out. A couple of them did. The rest were stuck. Zack, the Officer in charge at the time sent me to go and get some more help. He sent someone else up to the bridge to radio in for help but before either of us made it topside again, that’s when everything went to hell.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “What happened next?” I asked.\n\n  “Honestly? I don’t know,” Cameron replied. “We heard the guy on the PA saying that we were being boarded, but the power went out before he could say much else. At first we figured it was just something to do with the storm, or the damage. But as we headed up to the top deck, we started hearing sounds. People screaming. Something that sounded sorta like gunfire. Then there was this smell…” Cameron trailed off before sighing. He rubbed his face, slowly shaking his head. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “God… I don’t know how to describe it…” he murmured, “Burning, I guess.”\n\n  “Your crewmates?” I asked quietly. Cameron nodded.\n\n  “Yeah…” he said, “Yeah, I think so…”\n\n  “What did you do?” I asked.\n\n  “The guy I was with got brave. Wanted to see what was going on firsthand. But by the time we smelled the burning, I already knew that going up there was suicide. I tried to warn him, but he didn’t listen. He made a choice to go up there. I made a choice not to. Instead, I went to the galley, grabbed the sharpest knife I could find, and closed the door. I figured that in a best case scenario, they wouldn’t find me and I could keep away from them. And in a worst case scenario, maybe I could at least take one of them with me.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sat still, hanging on to Cameron’s every word. His voice trembled a little as he spoke and he still had a faraway look in his eyes, recounting every detail as if he were reliving it all again. \n\n  “After a while, the ship went quiet. The air around me was freezing. Colder than it had ever been. I could hear movement on the deck above me, but I didn’t hear any more fighting. Then I started hearing footsteps coming down the hall outside. I could hear them opening doors. Looking for survivors, I think. They must’ve found some. I heard screams. Something that sounded a lot like gunshots although… well, I’m not exactly an expert on guns, but it didn’t sound like any gun I’d ever heard. It made this sort of crackling, sizzling sound, and after it was fired that burning smell just got stronger…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother pause. I could see him recalling the smell he’d described. \n\n  “Finally they came to my door. I thought about trying to keep it closed, but I was afraid they could shoot me through the door. So I hid. The door opened. I held my knife in a white knuckled grip and I saw a figure coming in. It was too dark to make him out clearly at first, but what was immediately clear to me was that the guy who’d just walked in wasn’t very tall. About five feet, give or take. He seemed to be wearing some kind of environment suit. The helmet was reflective. I could see my own face in it, but I don’t think that whoever had come in saw me. Not at first, anyway. They were holding some kind of gun in their hand. Don’t ask me about the design of it, I never got a good look at it… honestly, the thing I remember the most is hearing the sound of my blood rushing through my skull. The figure in the room was about to look over at me, and that’s when I lunged. I grabbed him by the arm that was holding the gun and pulled him toward me. I heard the gun go off. It made the same sizzling noise I’d heard earlier and I could feel this heat on my left side. But I never saw any sort of muzzle flash. There were some dishtowels on the counter beside me that caught fire and they were just about the only light through which I could see what I was doing. The guy I had was struggling pretty hard. He wasn’t strong, but he was fighting. So I took the knife and I stabbed him in his chest. He didn’t scream. He was just… silent. He was still fighting and trying to get away from me and I was trying to keep a hold on him. I ended up ripping the knife out of him and he tried to make a run for it. He almost slipped away from me, but I grabbed him, dragged him back in. His head slammed against the counter and his helmet broke open. That was when he turned to look at me and that was when I saw his face…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “What did he look like?” I asked quietly.\n\n  “Like something out of a goddamn sci fi movie.” Cameron replied, “He had these eyes. Big black and shiny… and that was just about all he had. Not much of a nose, a small mouth. The eyes took up most of his face and there was just… no expression in them. Nothing I could recognize, at least. He stared at me and I didn’t know what he could’ve been thinking. If there were any thoughts behind those eyes, they were all alien to me… I could hear others just outside the door, probably coming to investigate the noise. I ripped the knife out of the creature again and drove it into one of those empty black eyes. Its struggles stopped, save for a few twitches.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “You killed him?” I asked.\n\n  “It,” Cameron said, “Not him… and yeah, I killed it. I honestly wasn’t even sure if it could die. The gun fell out of its hand and I grabbed it off the floor. Around the same time I did, I saw these two other figures in the hall wearing the same type of environment suit. I saw one of them raise their gun at me, so I took the gun that I had, pulled the trigger and I just started shooting. Just like before, it didn’t really seem to fire anything. There was no recoil, it didn’t feel like anything came out of it. There was just this heat…” he paused, struggling to think of a way to describe it. “You ever been on one of those theme park rides with the pyrotechnics? You know how you can feel the heat from them on your face? It was just like that. Just heat, nothing else. It must’ve done something though. The figure who’d been raising their gun at me, they started to burn. So did the figure beside them. They tried to get back, but I just kept shooting at them. I could… I could smell them cooking in that hazard suit of theirs. They didn’t put up much of a fight after that. They just sorta collapsed. I could hear even more coming to investigate and for a moment, I thought about taking the gun and trying to use it against them, you know?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Did you?” I asked.\n\nCameron uttered a quiet, empty laugh.\n\n  “Figured I’d just get myself killed all the sooner if I tried,” he admitted. “I mean, whoever they were, they probably had a way to counter their own weapons, right? Even if they didn’t, all they needed to do was point and shoot. So no. I didn’t go all Rambo on them. I closed the door again and waited to see if they’d come for me a second time.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Did they?”\n\n  “No. But I heard them outside. Probably trying to figure out just what to do to me. I just sorta held my ground. I put out the fire that had started earlier and I waited. The whole time I was waiting for them to come in and kill me. I could hear their footsteps out there. I figured they must’ve been doing something, but nothing ever happened. They didn’t make a move and neither did I.”\n\n  “So this standoff?” I asked, “How did it end?”\n\n  “They left,” he replied plainly. “After about… I don’t know, fifteen, twenty minutes something else made the ship rock. Some sort of explosion, I think. I was sure the entire damn ship was going down this time, but it didn’t and my friends outside didn’t seem too worried about it. After a few moments, I heard their footsteps getting further away and then, nothing at all. I went to the door to see if I could hear anything, but there was nothing out there. They weren’t even gone twenty minutes when the body of the dead one started to burn.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Burn?” I asked.\n\n  “Yeah. The suit just started smoking and I could see the body sort of burning inside. The whole thing kinda freaked me out, so I used the side door to make my way into the mess hall and get away from it. The body burned for about another twenty minutes or so before the fire died down. Around the same time, the gun started doing the same thing. It got so hot that I had to drop it and sorta just burned itself away.”\n\n  “Why?” I asked.\n\n  “Hell if I know,” Cameron said. “Some sort of protective measure, maybe? Whoever it was, didn’t want their tech falling into the wrong hands? Maybe the guys outside had hoped that the fire would kill me. Who knows. Either way, when I went to check on the body later, there wasn’t much left. Just this scorch mark where it had been. Same for the gun.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “So there was nothing left behind then?” I asked.\n\n  “Just the marks on the floor,” he said. “After that, I waited a few hours before trying to get out of the mess hall, but the door wouldn’t budge. Neither would the door to the galley. The rescue team told me they were both frozen shut. I’m not sure if that was an accident, or somebodys way of keeping me from causing any more trouble. Either way, I guess I’m lucky I got stuck in the galley. The food there kept me alive for the next few days. The power never came back on, but they had some perishables I could eat.”\n\n  “I see,” I said quietly. “When the rescue team found you, you attacked one of them with a knife, is that correct?” I asked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “I thought that those things had come back for me,” he said. “I panicked. Soon as I realized what I’d done… I…” he trailed off, “I was in that room for three days. Freezing my ass off, trying to stay alive, waiting to die… I wasn’t exactly myself when they found me.”\n\n  “Of course not,” I said. “I’m sorry, I wasn’t trying to insinuate anything. It’s just, I have to say your retelling of things sounds a little…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCameron’s expression darkened.\n\n  “You don’t believe me?” He asked.\n\n  “I do believe you,” I said. “But like you said, when we recovered you, you weren’t exactly in your right mind. I’m just suggesting that there may be some details you’re misremembering… the figures you saw. The way you described them, they didn’t sound human.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “They weren’t human,” Cameron said before leaning in closer to me. “You’ve seen the boat, haven’t you?” He asked, “Do you know anything that could have possibly done that? I saw the bodies on my way out… burned so bad their own mothers couldn’t recognize them. I saw what those guns of theirs could do. If you go down into the galley, you’ll find the scorch marks on the floor. Go on. Look. You can tell me I’m crazy if you want to, but I know what I saw. Whatever came for us that day, it wasn’t human.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was an intensity in his eyes that I must admit, did unnerve me a little. These were the eyes of a man who truly believed what he’d seen and I knew that there wasn’t a single doubt in his mind about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the days following my interview with Nathan Cameron, I returned to the Walter for a follow up investigation. I focused primarily on the galley and the mess hall, where Cameron had been confined. Sure enough, I found the scorch marks he’d told me I’d find there and I asked the lab to examine them, hoping that maybe they’d give us some clue about what exactly it was that someone had been so eager to burn away. Part of me had hoped that maybe they’d be the missing piece to all this. Hell, maybe they were. But if the lab ever found anything, neither me nor my team ever heard about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot even a week after my interview, our team was pulled off the investigation. According to our bosses, it was being handed over to some other department although they never specified who exactly it was being handed over to. The whole thing was fairly hush hush. We were made to sign NDAs and told that if the subject of the Walter ever came up, we were to simply say that the ship had capsized. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo less than a year after the ordeal with the Walter, I retired. Partially because I was old and I’d damn well earned it and partially as a way to get the Walter out of my head. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt didn’t work. I’ve spent the past eight years lying awake at night, going over the evidence in my head. I’ve replayed my interview with Nathan Cameron over and over again in my head so many times that I’m quite sure I’ve written down every word exactly as it was said. I’ve tried to piece this thing together in a way that makes sense, but nothing quite fits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe closest thing I’ve got to an answer is that this was some sort of espionage thing. I think it explains why the cargo was burned and why the investigation was taken off our hands. But that answer doesn’t quite fit. I can’t think of a weapon on earth with the ability to burn a hole through the hull of a ship like that, nor can I think of any possible way that someone could have so perfectly frozen the water around the ship. The weapons that were used to burn the cargo and slaughter the crew don’t match the profile of any weapon I’ve ever heard of and in eight years of research, I’ve yet to find any type of weapon that could do something similar. There is nothing on earth that could do the kind of damage we saw done on the Walter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to the thing that haunts me the most.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe way that Cameron described the figure he’d encountered, the one he’d stabbed to death. He was convinced that it wasn’t human and the way he described it, I’m not so sure that he was wrong. Maybe I’m going crazy in my old age, but if there’s nothing on earth that could have carried out that attack on the Walter… then maybe whatever attacked that ship didn’t come from earth. Maybe I’m just going crazy in my old age. Maybe I’m grasping at straws here. Maybe I’m misremembering something. But it’s the only conclusion I’ve reached that explains everything. And if it’s true, what happens if they come back?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe I’m just crazy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGod, I hope I’m just crazy.",

        "text": "“What if you did the interiors in a light sage green?” \n\n“You read my mind, Mom.” I sat curled up on the couch in my cottage, trying not to stare at the notebook resting on the coffee table several feet away. I hadn’t dared to open it yet and calling my mom was an effective stalling mechanism. I had taken a hot shower and was wrapped in multiple blankets, but when I closed my eyes I could see that terrible churning sky. \n\n“So, uh, what else is going on with you?” I asked, desperate for a bit of normalcy. Or rather what had passed for normalcy between us since Dad’s accident.\n\n“I’ve actually been meaning to tell you. You remember that travel agent I was working with last year? She called me today. Told me they’ve had a last minute cancellation for the cruise around the world! Over one hundred days, round trip from Miami! It leaves next week. I don’t know if you remember, but that trip had always been—”\n\n“Dad’s dream.” I finished the sentence. “I think you should go. Dad would have wanted you to go.”\n\n“Thanks, honey. I…” She paused. I could tell she was trying to regain her composure. “I’ll call you again before I leave.”\n\nAs I ended the call, part of me wanted to scream with questions, tell her everything, but I knew it would be futile. And besides, just how much did my mom know anyway? She was from New Jersey and though my parents had married here and lived here until I was in first grade, she had always been an outsider. It’s not like she had a good track record of believing me about this sort of thing anyway.\n\nThe previous night’s events had gotten me thinking, re-evaluating everything I knew about this place. After we moved away, we’d spend every summer up here, my dad going back and forth from Manhattan when he could get time away. Most of the time my mom insisted on renting a bigger sort of house than my uncle’s cottages, especially if it was on an island. She loved the novelty of taking a boat to get groceries, and so did I. I always imagined being a pirate smuggling loot. But one summer, the house we were renting wasn’t available for the last few days of our planned trip and rather than go home early, my uncle offered us one of the cottages. My dad was already back to work in the city so since it was just the two of us, my mom agreed to stay in Cottage 9.\n\nI was seven years old and was glad for the extra time. My uncle’s dock was a great fishing spot, the water in the summer was often so clear and bright that it is not an exaggeration to say it could be mistaken for the Caribbean. I would often sit with my feet splashing around for hours, just watching the boats go by, lacing around the patchwork greens of the islands dotting the river, weaving in and out of the border between two countries. I’d keep a tally of their flags, stars and stripes versus maple leaves. \n\nBut that day I hadn’t been in the water. It was overcast and humid and I had spent the day mostly curled up with my sketchbook on the porch of our cottage. So I was taken aback when my mom burst through the door in an uncharacteristic rage.\n\n“Nora! What is the matter with you? I thought you knew better than tracking wet footprints through the house?”\n\n“I didn’t! I haven’t been swimming today.”\n\nMy mom shook her head in disbelief. \n\n“Then what’s this?” She gestured inside. I sullenly followed her, brimming with injustice. My stomach sank. She was right. There was a trail of sloppy, wet footprints leading from the front door back to the bedroom, culminating in a large puddle in front of the door. \n\n“It wasn’t me,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. My mom was not pleased with the denial.\n\n“I can’t believe you.” She threw me a couple towels. “Clean it up.”\n\nMy face burned in indignation, but I began to wipe up the footprints anyway. It didn’t take that long at all, but I was struck just by how cold the water was. It was absolutely freezing—strange for such a small amount of water on a hot day. It was unsettling, though, at age seven, I just assumed it wouldn’t be so odd if friendly woodland creatures traipsed around these cottages. I was more upset that my mother hadn’t believed me when I told her I didn’t make the mess.\n\nI made sure she saw how mad I was at dinner, refusing to speak to her while inhaling my hot dog, pointedly looking past her while slurping my lemonade.\n\nMy mom sighed. \n\n“Listen, Nora. I’m sorry for yelling earlier. I know you didn’t do it on purpose. Can we be friends now?”\n\n“I didn’t do it at all, though!”\n\nShe shook her head as she brought our plates to the sink. While I tried to not be as cross the rest of the night, we both were mildly annoyed with each other and went to bed earlier than usual. \n\nDespite the day’s unpleasantness, I immediately fell into a deep sleep, as only children can. I opened my eyes hours later. The clock read 3:00 in the morning. Confused as to what had awoken me, I sat up and looked around. My mom was sound asleep, the room was quiet. I decided I needed to use the bathroom, since I was already awake. As I carefully opened the bedroom door so as to not wake my mother, my bare foot made contact with another giant puddle of freezing cold water, sending a chill up and down my little body. I somehow managed to suppress a cry.\n\nDown the hallway, I could see something in the living room. A person, it looked like, standing with its back towards me. *Maybe Martina is back*, I thought hopefully. She would often be doing things around the property at all hours, though she had been noticeably absent the couple days we had been at the Cottages. \n\nI took several hesitant steps forward, eyes straining to see the visitor in the dark. The person appeared to be a woman, but it had long pale hair. It stood dripping wet from head to toe, as though it had just left the waters of the river. My heart began to palpitate frantically. *Not Martina*. *Not Martina. Not Martina.* Just then the floorboards under my feet made an agonizing creek. With unnatural speed, the thing’s head whipped around. I couldn’t scream, but tears began to flow down my cheeks in terror. The thing, maybe it had been a person once, had no eyes, just dismal pools of blackness, it’s nose long rotted away. It beckoned to me with dripping, emaciated arms. \n\n“N..n..no,” I whimpered, shaking my head, as though that would dispel the nightmare before me. The thing’s mouth opened and it emitted a strangled, wretched shriek, as if the last breath before drowning. And that was the last thing I remembered before crumpling to the ground.\n\n“Nora?! Wake up, Nora!” I awoke coughing up water, completely soaked from my head to my pajamas. I was on the ground, the dock glowed red before me in the first light of the sunrise.\n\nMy mother gathered me in her arms. She was sweating, so warm. I was so cold.\n\n“What…what happened?” I asked feebly. \n\n“I woke up and you weren’t in bed. There was a trail of water leading from the bedroom and out the door of the cottage. In the river, I...” My mother began to sob. “You were floating there. I ran as fast as I could and pulled you out.”\n\n“Mom, it wasn’t me. It was the Wet Lady. She… she didn’t have any eyes.”\n\nShe pulled me in tighter and I clung to her nightgown, trying to banish the sound of that terrible cry. \n\n“Shhhhh…It’s okay. You’re safe now. You were just sleepwalking. Sleepwalking to your favorite place. There’s no lady, sweetheart. It’s going to be okay.”\n\nIn the years that followed, I had assumed my mother was right, although I had never done any sleepwalking either before or since. Human beings, myself included, have an incredible ability to brush aside the unknown, especially the horrifying unknown. An essential survival skill, a feat of evolution. But now I knew better.\n\nI tried to stifle a shudder as I reached for Martina’s notebook.\n\n“Here goes nothing,” I said to no one.\n\nOn the first yellowed page, the notes began, in the same blue ballpoint pen as the cover. I recognized Martina’s handwriting.\n\n*Q1: Feb 1*\n\n*Q2: May 1*\n\n*Q3: Aug 1*\n\n*Q4: October 31*\n\n*They come to you.*\n\n*Perform your ablutions (3x)*\n\n*Do not interfere.*\n\n*Burn the offering.*\n\nThat was the only text on the page. *Fiscal quarters?* I would have laughed, had I not been so nauseated by the prospect of having what happened the night before be a *quarterly* event. I grabbed the notebook and went outside to find Martina.\n\nI found her sitting in a folding chair at the dock, dressed in her warmest parka, a woolen hat with cat ears pulled over her head, a thick cat blanket wrapped around her legs. She was fishing. \n\n“We need to talk,” I said waiving the notebook. \n\nShe shrugged.\n\n“Did you read it?”\n\n“I’m just at the first page and I already have questions.”\n\nShe shrugged again.\n\n“Thought that page should be pretty clear to you. Especially after last night.”\n\n“That happens *four* times a year*?* And what’s with the fiscal quarters nonsense? Taxes? Also, what does it mean to ‘burn the offering’?”\n\nShe sighed and looked down at her line into the water.\n\n“First of all, the offering was the…let’s just call it the ‘leftovers’ from last night’s events. It’s always some macabre display.  Just collect it, toss it in the fire and try to not think about it again.  As for ‘taxes,’ it’s how your grandfather explained it to me, many, many years ago. The way he saw it, it was something *owed*.  A never-ending obligation. So he called it our taxes.”\n\n“Taxes to whom? Or what?”\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“That I do not know, doll. I’ve been around here for over fifty years and all I know is that you follow what that book says and you don’t get trouble. I’m not going to lie and say it gets easier with time.”\n\n“Then why not tell me the day I got here?  Why bother humoring me with my idiotic renovation plans? There’s no way I can open this place as a business!”\n\n“Your grandfather did. Avoid the cursed cottages. Close the place down on…tax days.”\n\n“*Cursed* cottages?”\n\n“You really didn’t get past page one, did you?” She pointed to the notebook in my hand expectantly. I flipped past the first page. More neat printing in pen.\n\n*Cottages*\n\n*Numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15: maintain as usual*\n\nThe remaining cottages had a series of—fuck it—*taxes* listed, along with a timetable for payment. My eyes immediately darted to Cottage 9.\n\n*Number 9*\n\n*A pair of blue marbles. One freshly caught river perch. Confirm receipt of payment.*\n\n*Payment schedule: every three weeks*\n\nMartina had carefully listed every date of “payment” for the past twenty years. I looked at the date of the most recent one. My heart sank.\n\n“You’ve got to be kidding me.”\n\n“Why do you think I’m out here freezing my ass off fishing in February?”\n\n“Shit.”\n\n“Oh, Cottage 9 is a piece of cake compared to last night.”\n\n“Martina, I met the thing in Cottage 9. The Wet Lady. She almost drowned me when I was seven.”\n\nMartina looked aghast.\n\n“Impossible. When was this? You never stayed in any cottage besides your uncle’s.”\n\n“Late summer 1999. A few days before Labor Day, I think.”\n\nShe swore as she pulled in a perch.\n\n“Fucking Jake,” she said, taking out the hook. She tossed the perch into a bucket of water.\n\n“Who is Jake?”\n\n“My mother in Rochester was sick. In fact, she was on her deathbed. I was cocky; I thought it would be easy to train someone to do the cottage payments. I hired a college kid who needed some extra cash before the next semester began.  Jake.  Seemed bright to me.  Eager.  I arranged everything.  All he needed to do was put the payment in the right spot on the right days and not let anyone stay at the cottages requiring … tasks. I left him a calendar with everything circled! And still he fucked it up. Now there were many ways he fucked up — I’m not going to get into all of that here. But now you’re telling me he fucked up even more than I thought when he let you and your mother stay in Cottage 9.”\n\n“Who is she? The Wet Lady?”\n\nMartina laughed dryly.\n\n“The Wet Lady, eh? Never thought of her by that name, but I guess it fits.”\n\n“To be fair, I was seven.”\n\n“It’s a good description. Kids often have a knack for clarity. And don’t worry about tonight. I’ll handle it. As I said, this one is easy.”\n\n“I appreciate your concern, but, Martina, when is the last time you had a vacation? Don’t you want to retire? I sure as hell didn’t sign up for a lifetime of being responsible for the world’s most terrifying tax regime, but here I am. My name was in the will. Let me learn. Let yourself rest for once. Move to Florida or something.”\n\n“I’m a River Rat through and through, kid. There’s no Florida in it for me. But I hear what you’re saying. I thought it was unfair you got left with this on your shoulders. But…” She trailed off. Her shoulders sagged. She folded up her chair. I grabbed the bucket with the agitated fish. \n\n“It’s hard for me to admit it. But it would be nice to have the help.”\n\n“I promise I won’t be another Jake,” I laughed.\n\nI thought she would chuckle at my attempt at humor, but instead I thought I could almost detect a tear.\n\n“I pray every night you won’t,” she whispered, voice cracking.\n\n\\++\n\nShe told me to meet her after dark, naturally, but that the exact hour wasn’t important. We settled on ten o’clock. I insisted on meeting at the motel, then walking over. I was not quite ready to be standing in front of Cottage 9 after dark alone. \n\nWe walked over in silence, with only the sloshing of the fish’s bucket as a rhythm to our movement. When we arrived, she handed me a leather pouch. I could feel the smooth marbles inside. The cottage looked completely ordinary, the same pretty wood trim around the gables as the others, an attractive porch, though the screen on this one was perforated in several spots. Martina hobbled over to the door and put down the bucket, splashing a little excess water over the side. \n\nAt the sound of the water, I could hear a scurrying sound from inside the cottage that froze me to my place, hand clenched around the bag with the marbles. Martina had hurried behind a bush just out of view and was violently gesticulating for me to put the marbles down and go. My chest was tight, I couldn’t move, my breaths came in short stuttering spurts. \n\nBefore I could shake myself out of my panic, the door flew open and there before me was the Wet Lady. The black holes locked on to me and it cocked its head, almost as if in recognition. I tried to lift my arm to offer the marbles but the thing let out that ghastly shriek, half gasp, half cry and lunged at me with preternatural speed, wrapping its wet, cold fingers around my neck. It began to squeeze.\n\nMartina was screaming. “Nora! The marbles! The marbles, damnit!”\n\nI shut my eyes tight against the horror choking the life out of me. With that burst of energy that only comes in moments of life or death, I raised my hand clutching the marbles and shoved it into the thing’s face. With a growl it dropped me sputtering to the ground and snatched the marbles out of the leather bag. Weak and dazed I began to crawl away slowly, hoping the creature’s interest was sufficiently diverted.\n\nAlmost gingerly, the Wet Lady placed one marble in each of its eye holes. The marbles began to glow a sickly white and it let out another shriek, this one not nearly as filled with malice. It plunged its bony arm into the fish bucket and caught the fish, shoveling it down its throat whole. Satiated, it glided towards the river, not giving me a second glance, terrible eyes illuminated, and dove into the water. I watched the light of the eyes fade as it sunk down to the depths.\n\nI tried to sit up, my head throbbing uncontrollably. Martina stood over me, visibly relieved. \n\n“I’m going to be okay,” I choked out.\n\n“Well,” she said. “That was clearly a learning experience.”\n\n“No shit.”\n\nI went back to my cottage and poured myself some scotch with a trembling hand, but even that sweet peaty burn wasn’t doing much to calm my nerves. So I typed everything out again, forcing myself to put into words something that has haunted me since childhood. Crazy how well that seems to work. Maybe I’ll actually get some sleep now. \n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10ugxwp/i_own_an_abandoned_motel_and_no_we_are_not_open/)",

        "text": "A serial killer murdered my grandmother on her 80th birthday, breaking into her house and stabbing her over seventy times. He had killed other senior citizens in the area with the same MO, but to this day he hasn’t been caught. He stopped killing people after my grandmother. She was his sixth and apparently final victim, but that didn’t make me feel any better.\n\nI was absolutely heartbroken. My mother had died young of breast cancer the previous year, and my father was somewhere out on the West Coast, a hopeless alcoholic who hadn’t contacted me in over a decade. My grandmother was my last close family member. In her will, I got everything, including the house that she died in, but that didn’t make the sadness and despair any less. I felt totally alone in the world, and during quite a few low points, I even thought about hanging myself or taking an overdose of prescription opiates. I didn’t want to be alone anymore, and I was so tired of being depressed that I would have taken any means to make it end.\n\nAfter a week of endless depression and not sleeping, I started to get so desperate that I began reading the New Testament and praying every night. I would get down on my knees and ask God for help. On the third day, I think he answered.\n\nI had fallen into a restless sleep for a couple hours, the first real sleep I had gotten in days, when I heard a creaking floorboard next to my bed. I jumped up, but the darkness was so thick I couldn’t see more than silhouettes. I floundered around and turned on the light next to the bed, horrified to see someone in my room with me.\n\nThe being looked like an angel with chalk-white skin, totally bloodless and as smooth as polished stone. Its eyes were pure black orbs, and its teeth were sharpened to points. Massive white wings covered with tight skin extended behind it in each direction for eight or nine feet. The wings absolutely dwarfed his body. \n\nHe wore armor that glowed like bright silver with chain leggings and spotless glowing metal boots. A soft interior light seemed to emanate from his skin, his armor and his wings.\n\n“Jenna, God has heard your prayers,” he said to me. He came and put his hand on my cheek, softly stroking it. “He will help you through this time of sadness and depression. God only wants one thing from you in return.”\n\n“Anything,” I said. “Name it.”\n\n“He wants you to kill one random person and bring the body to the sacred altar in the forest,” the angel said, his black eyes staring into mine, his face only inches away from mine. I felt hypnotized. “If you do this, He will reward you with whatever you desire.” I felt sick, pulling back as the impact of his words finally pressed in on my mind.\n\n“What?” I asked, putting my hands up in front of my face suddenly, now terrified of this creature. “You’re no angel! Get out of my room!” His smile widened from ear to ear, and his hand reached out in the blink of an eye and smashed my lamp, plunging us into blackness. I fell back asleep instantly, as if by magic, and awoke in the morning to find the broken lamp on the floor. Otherwise, there was no sign of the mysterious visitor.\n\nI figured it must have been a dream. Perhaps I had simply reached out and broken the lamp during the night by accident while I was deep in the grips of some nightmare, and my mind had simply added the noise of the breaking lamp into the dream and made up the entire interaction with the angel. It was the only thing that made sense, after all. It made far more sense than actually being visited in the night by some supernatural entity asking me to murder people.\n\nI went through the door like a zombie, feeling the effects of sleep deprivation more and more clearly. After making a pot of coffee and drinking three or four cups, I felt I had enough energy to at least leave the house for a few hours. I decided to go for a walk in the nearby mountains.\n\nAs I walked down the trail, I kept seeing someone peeking at me from behind the trees, but every time I looked they had somehow disappeared. It looked like a dark silhouette of a human body, playing peek-a-boo with me and constantly winning. I even tried running to the area where I saw the figure a few times, but there was no one around, no twigs broken or brush pushed out of place, no sound of receding footsteps. I couldn’t figure it out. I figured either the sleep deprivation was getting to me, or I was seeing a ghost. I had never actually seen any evidence of ghosts or demons or anything before, so I just chalked it to the massive, long-lasting sleep deprivation I had been going through and started to ignore it.\n\nBut when I got home, things didn’t improve. I saw a figure peeking out from my closet door, which was open only a crack, and now that I was much closer I could see the face clearly. It was the face of that nightmarish angel with the chalk-white skin I had seen the night before. It kept appearing everywhere I looked, hiding behind the sofa, lurking behind me in my reflection in the bathroom mirror, even peeking out of the cabinet where I stored cereal and canned goods, a cabinet which was far too small to hold anything bigger than a cat. But I still saw that face, and everytime I got a good look at it, its smile had grown, its teeth growing longer and sharper, its eyes growing darker and more manic with every showing.\n\nNow I was truly afraid to go to sleep. I stayed up brewing pot after pot of coffee late into the night, reading book after book until I started to nod off despite all the caffeine I had consumed. I caught myself a couple times, but it was a battle I couldn’t win, and eventually I nodded off for good.\n\nIn a half-hypnotized, dream-like state, I saw a cupboard I had never noticed before opening up in my living room, a little gremlin-like creature peeking out. It was totally different from the angel I had seen, but had the same huge black staring eyes. As I woke up fully, I saw it grow and transform into the white-skinned demonic-looking being that had accompanied me in my room before.\n\nIgnoring the being standing before me, I walked right past it and opened up the hidden cupboard. It blended in perfectly with the wall, and if I didn’t know exactly where the door was, I would never have found it. Inside there was a miniature table, tiny chairs, a tiny mirror and a hole in the ground that smelled absolutely foul, like urine and old, dried-up feces. I turned my attention back to the angel standing there, but found instead a little gremlin, two feet tall with pure black eyes, skin as green as the needles of a pine tree and huge, bat-like ears. He looked small and almost cute in the half-light of the moon.\n\n“So,” I said, crossing my arms and looking down at him, “*you’re* the one causing me all this trouble, huh?” He trembled slightly, raising his hands.\n\n“Please,” he said in a small voice, “I just want to continue living here in peace. I was friends with the old woman who lived here before, but the bad man came in and she died. I wasn’t here to protect her…” His small voice died away into silence, the buzzing of cicadas and crickets the only noises remaining.\n\n“Well,” I said, kneeling down and pinching his long, crooked nose, “you are just the *cutest* little guy I have ever seen!” He hissed at me, raising himself up to his full height- which still barely came up to my kneecap.\n\n“I am not!” he said in an outraged, high-pitched voice. “I am the nightmare that haunts the streets! I am vicious!” He showed his tiny fangs and baby-sized molars at this, and I squealed with delight.\n\n“That’s it,” I said, “you’re staying here with me.” I swept him up in my arms and gave him a hug. He didn’t resist, but his thin arms wrapped around my neck, and he put his warm face against mine, sighing in his squeakiest voice.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI came back home in the middle of the night from the cemetery, covered in dirt and grime. Uruk, as he had told me his name was, ran out of his hidden cupboard, dressed in a fashionable suit originally designed for children. He loved to dress up and impress me, putting on tiny bowties and pint-sized fedoras I had bought him, clothing that made me laugh and pick him up. I was happy to have a companion now, and the depression and sleeplessness that had plagued me had left completely. I often fell asleep holding Uruk, spooning him like a teddy bear.\n\n“Jenna did you bring it did you get it did you did you…?” he asked rapidly, his pupils dilating in excitement. I nodded, dragging a tied-up tarp in through the door and laying it out on the kitchen. It was a freshly dead human body, an old woman who had died from heart disease by the look of her. Uruk clapped his hands in joy, jumping up and down like a kid on Christmas morning.\n\nHe knelt down, using his sharp fangs to rip the skin on the face off, before moving down to the neck and chest. I left him to his dinner, as watching him eat often made me queasy.\n\nAs long as I kept him fed, though, he said I was in no danger. He could only eat human bodies, but whether they were killed or died from another cause made no difference to him.\n\nAt least I’m not alone anymore, and that *has* made all the difference to me. My prayers had been answered.",

        "text": "While waiting in line at the store for a self-checkout terminal, a man casually sidled up to me and asked if I’d mind lending him a few dollars, as he was short on cash. I glanced at his hand basket, saw that he only had a few items (some fruit, bottled water, packs of tuna, a loaf of bread) and offered to just pay for his groceries; seeing as how the cost wouldn’t be more than ten or fifteen dollars. I hadn’t put much in my cart, so our combined totals wouldn’t break the bank. He looked at me as if I’d offered him my kidney, his eyes watering and lip quivering. Before he could say anything, I told him that it’d be alright, that I wouldn’t mind at all, and nudged my cart over so he could deposit his items. He gave a heartful smile, nodded his head, and added his items to the cart.  \n\nThe line cleared, I paid for what we’d gathered, and gave him his items. As gratefully as he could, he thanked me and shook my hand, and we parted ways.  \n\nI went home with that little warm feeling in my chest that arises after you’ve done a nice thing for someone, and hoped that he’d pass on the gesture to someone else.  \n\nWell, he did. Just not in a way I would’ve ever expected.  \n\nThe following day, I went back to the same store to grab a drink and snack, about the same time I’d gone yesterday. And, mildly surprising, the same man was also there. Again, his handheld basket carried the same few items. He saw me, our eye met, and for a moment I thought, “Oh boy, I hope he isn’t some kind of grifter, getting strangers to buy him things every day.” But then he smiled and pointed at the drink and chips in my hand; gesturing for me to put them in his basket. I complied, thanking him and sharing a laugh at the coincidental nature of it all. He gave me my things and we parted ways again, having developed a little grocery store friendship.  \n\nI saw him again, three days later, at the same store—at the same time.  \n\nAgain, he carried a basket with only a few items: those single-serve packs of tuna, some fruit, a loaf of bread, and a couple bottles of water. Something about the regularity of our meeting and his seemingly unchanging diet unnerved me. Despite the man’s completely harmless appearance and outward nature, I nonetheless felt that there was something *off* about him. But I didn’t want to sour the little acquaintanceship we’d developed, so I waved and politely asked about his spartan diet. He laughed and replied that they were the items he went through most often, assuring me that his palate wasn’t so limited. I remarked that I’d have no room to criticize, considering my own relatively simple tastes.  \n\nThinking the interaction over, I said, “See ya later.” and went over to the next available self-checkout terminal. As I finished scanning my last item and prepared to pay, *he* came up beside me, resting his basket on the counter. He locked eyes with me and said, “Have you forgotten? It’s your turn to cover things.” I was taken aback, since I’d never once thought that it’d be a regular thing; us paying for each other’s items every time we happened to meet. But not wanting to make a scene, and having enough money to cover everything, I complied; even sheepishly apologizing for having “forgotten.” His ever-present smile broadened, and he nodded in thanks.  \n\nHe took his portion of the bags and departed, leaving me more than a little disturbed. Still, nothing actually hostile had happened, so I didn’t make a fuss about it to the staff; who I’m sure hadn’t even noticed our odd exchange. At that moment I did decide to never again visit the store at the same time, just so I wouldn’t have to deal with him again. I couldn’t cover his purchases forever.  \n\nA few days later, I was back at the store, only I’d gone *before* work, at 7am when the store first opened. I was the first one in, and felt a huge relief at seeing the self-checkout completely clear when I had gathered what I needed. But just as I was about to hit “Pay now” on the touchscreen, a hand stopped mine. Turning, I saw *him,* standing there with a smile on his face, and his same peculiar assortment of items in his cart. Utterly shocked, I just stood there. Using his needlessly solid grip on my hand, he lightly pushed me aside. He proceeded to quietly scan his own items, then selected pay now and inserted his money.  \n\nDespite the charitable gesture, there was an almost palpable aura of malice about him, as if the “kind” act was – somehow - subtly *unkind*. It honestly freaked me out, and I would’ve just left—abandoning the roughly $45 dollars in groceries—if he hadn’t been holding onto my hand. But then the machine spat out the receipt, he deposited it into one of my bags, and released his grip. I didn’t even bother thanking him, I just grabbed my stuff and headed toward the front. But before I could exit, he called out, “Remember, next one’s on you!”  \n\nI didn’t respond, and practically ran to my car.  \n\nFor the next round of groceries a week later, I went to a completely different store on the other side of town.  \n\nStill, there was a feeling of trepidation as I gathered my items; pushing my cart carefully, peeking around corners, hoping not to spot *him.* I even avoided the aisles that held the items he’d consistently purchased, dreading to see him browsing the shelves. Finally ready to pay and leave, I walked toward self-checkout as a death-row inmate might walk to the chair, each step carrying a grim weight. \n\n**My fears and anxiety were confirmed:** Even though I hadn’t seen him anywhere in the store, *he was there*; waiting behind an old woman, who was doubtlessly oblivious to the man’s almost logic-defying presence.  \n\nI hadn’t made a sound in my approach, but he still turned around, as if sensing me. He smiled and raised his basket, and there were the same usual items inside. A register opened, and he nodded toward it, motioning for me to go ahead. And, as if being led to some terrible fate by unyielding hands, I went to the register. But even though I’d followed his order, I swore to myself then and there that I wouldn’t pay for his items.  \n\nI began scanning my things, all the while sensing his gaze, knowing he was waiting for me to finish before coming over to add his own. When the last item was scanned, I carefully retrieved my card from my wallet, not wanting to show this man how utterly terrified I was. And, as expected, he came over and began unloading his basket onto the counter.  \n\nWith enough force to stop them but not enough to draw attention, I put my hand down and whispered “No.” It took a mad fight against my nerves, but I managed to look up and meet his gaze, and for the first time I noticed how *off* his eyes were. Not necessarily in their alignment on his face, but the way they stared, the smoldering intensity behind an otherwise normal, pedestrian appearance.  \n\nIt was the expression of someone who had been *born* unhinged and had only adapted to normal, sane society; rather than someone sane who had slowly cracked under some great stress or pressure.  \n\nSomehow, my resolve held, and I didn’t back down from that face of carefully contained lunacy. He smiled, and to my complete surprise, began returning his items to his basket. Not wasting the opportunity to escape, I inserted my card, paid, and gathered my bags. Risking a look back, I saw him talking to another man, whom—after inclining his head to listen—shrugged his shoulders and nodded. My unhinged acquaintance then put his items in the man’s cart, and together they headed to the register I had just left.  \n\nA sense of duty to my fellow man compelled me to warn the guy, even at some unknown risk to my own person. I started to head over, but someone grabbed my arm at the last moment. It was a woman, someone I’d never seen before. She looked utterly depressed, her hair disheveled, her eyes sunken, her cheeks hollow as if she’d had some buccal fat removal operation. Quietly, she pulled me aside.  \n\n“Don’t. You have a day, maybe two. What you have in your cart there, can you live off that for a week?”  \n\nI looked down, automatically assessing the contents even as I shuddered at the urgency in her voice. I’d spent about seventy-five dollars, which I knew wouldn’t last me very long these days.  \n\nI met her gaze, and she must’ve seen the doubt on my face, because she pulled me closer and said: \n\n“It doesn’t matter. Just eat as conservatively as you can. That man over there, the one you’ve presumably been bumping into here, or at other stores; he’s psychotic, and that’s *if he’s even human.* He’s gotten the same stuff every time, right? Tuna, fruit, some water, bread. Never deviating from that. How do I know? Because that’s what I sent my husband out to get, *six months ago.* He had told me how he bumped into this stranger, who’d asked him if he could pay for something—a dictionary and a book of maps. My husband complied, figuring the man to be homeless or something like that. \n\n“My husband had had those items in his cart—the tuna, water, fruit, and bread—at the time. He said that they parted ways on friendly terms, but that the man had seemed...off, strange in an undefinable way. Well, he saw him again the next day, grabbing some other things we needed. This time, the stranger had a cart, and the same items my husband had bought the day before were in there. The stranger paid for my husband’s items, being just as friendly as he’d been before. But then they *again*, and I’m sure you can guess what items were in the man’s basket.”  \n\nThere was a certain mania in her eyes, though one that was obviously born of long-held anxiety, if not full-blown terror. She wasn’t crazy, not like *him.* She had experienced something awful, and hadn’t been able to truly express herself to someone until meeting me.  \n\nHearing the ding of items being scanned at a leisurely pace behind me, I told her to continue.  \n\n“Finally, my husband said no—that he wouldn’t pay for the man’s items anymore; that he had grown uncomfortable with the whole affair. He said that the man didn’t seem to be offended, and allowed my husband to finishing checking out unbothered. My husband came home, told me about what had happened, and we had a little laugh at the absurdity of it all.  \n\n“And then the next day I came home from work to find several groceries bags on the kitchen table. We hadn’t needed groceries—he’d stocked up the last time, presumably so he wouldn’t have to deal with the man for a while—so I was understandably upset by how much he’d spent. But before I could even call out to him, I saw the *puddle* beneath the table.  \n\n“It was bright red, and still expanding via a steady stream of crimson from the table’s surface. The inner animal part of me understood at once, but still I continued forward; my conscious mind unbelieving, unable to accept that anything so monstrous could happen in our civilized society.  \n\n“I opened the bag nearest the edge of the table, and saw my husband’s face staring up at me; pale and lifeless. He’d been savagely dismembered and *bagged.*  \n\n“I immediately knew who the culprit was, called the police when I managed to...to recover. But they didn’t do much, couldn’t; the man’s face was mysteriously blurred in the store’s security footage. There’d never been a clear shot of him. \n\n“Eventually, I mustered the courage to wait around the store, and eventually saw him. Tracked him. I've tried pointing him out, but his face is never clear; and the police refuse to take any action, not wanting to risk causing trouble for some random person. Afraid to be sued, I guess. I know they think I’m crazy, but *you* don’t, right? You’ve been through it, you know what’s he like. It’s why I’m telling you to leave here, to go as far away as you can.  \n\n“My husband may have been the first, but you aren’t the second; I’ve watched him do this to others. I’ve tried to warm them; I hope that they’ve listened. I’d approach the ‘man’ myself, confront him in front of everyone.... but I’m scared. You can’t blame me, can you? After what he did to my husband... I can’t fight him—I won’t try to—but I can warn others; even if it means driving every store in town out of business or making a fool of myself to strangers.” \n\nWith a final tearful smile, she ushered me ahead of her. I glanced back, saw the allegedly murderous stranger shaking hands with his latest “friend”, and hurried out the door. \n\nI hope the woman manages to convincingly warn him before it’s too late. ",

        "text": " As per the title, I don’t think I want to go to school anymore. I don’t know what it is, I just have a bad feeling. It's the thought I’ve had running in my head all morning.   \n\n The day began normally. I went to the school office to turn on my phone. We aren’t allowed to have it on us. My best friend, let’s call him Sam, told me I was a “goody-two-shoes.” I laughed it off, stating not everyone can be a big rebel like him. We’re close like that, we can give each other a little bit of a tease, but we both know we’re still friends. Besides, I really didn’t care; I didn’t need my phone for the day, and  getting sent to the principal Jenkin’s office for such a small thing just really wasn’t worth it. I don’t know why, but that office just really gave me an uneasy feeling. \n\nMr Jenkins was really quite harmless though. I remember one time Sam and I were sent to the office for misbehaving. Well, I mean, Sam had intentionally clogged the toilets in the bathroom with about 10 rolls of whole toilet paper causing a massive flood. The school Janitor was fuming over it and had pulled us by the ear all the way to Mr. Jenkin’s office. \n\nIt was probably the first time we had sat face to face with Mr. Jenkins. He was a short man with a receding hairline and buckteeth. He was one of those middle-aged types that tried desperately to relate to teenagers but his attempts always came across as insincere. When he tried to lecture us about the incident, he spoke with a stammer. He said something like: “D-d-do you kn-know ho-how m-much m-m-money you cost the s-sc-school??” I tried to apologize for it but Sam jumped in. \n\n“D-d-do you kn-know ho-how m-much of our t-t-t-t-t-t-time you’re w-w-wasting??”  Sam exaggerated every syllable, dragging out every obvious stutter to make it abundantly clear how empty Mr. Jenkin’s words were to us. And to be honest, I felt kind of bad. Mr. Jenkins was the kind of teacher that tried his best, but in return got constant mockery for his ugly appearance and nervous way of talking. It made me feel even worse when he immediately dismissed us, telling us we may return to class. Like what Sam did was bad enough to be at least suspended, if not expelled, yet Mr. Jenkins was so powerless to do anything about it, and we both got off scott free. \n\nAnyway, that was the only time I’d ever been in his office. Ever since then, walking past it gave me a sense of terrible unease. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. There was nothing unusual about it. It was an ordinary office with a wooden desk, a computer and a small monitor that was almost falling apart. Mr. Jenkins did have a collection of dolls in a class cabinet, but I didn’t really get a good look at them. They might have been those old antique dolls; he was probably just a collector. Even so, I feel like lately Mr. Jenkins has been giving me these odd looks. Like he knows I’m up to something. Almost like he can read my mind. Which is just silly of course. I’m not sure why I’m even talking about it. \n\nIn math class today Sam got in trouble for misbehaving. It wasn't anything major, just some goofing off that got out of hand. You know, just too much chatting, and joking around. We both drew a crude picture of Mr. Jenkins and I think he may have also been blamed for that. I don’t quite remember.  Either way, he was sent to the principal’s office. Sam thought it was an amusing punishment and was off on his merry way. After all, last time he openly mocked Mr. Jenkins and completely escaped punishment. \n\nAnyway, later on it was modern history class. I kept looking around searching for Sam. He never showed up. That was odd, I thought, surely he wouldn’t miss out on a whole day of school over one tiny little incident. Maybe Jenkins was more angry than I thought he’d be. Maybe he was suspended. I don’t know. It seems like an overreaction if that’s the case. I mean, something like this was not nearly as bad as clogging the toilets. \n\nAnyway, by the end of the day Sam was still nowhere to be seen. I started to get a little worried. Maybe he really did get suspended. Or maybe he got sick or something and they sent him home. When I got my phone back from the school office, I immediately checked my texts. Nothing. I hoped quietly that his phone wasn’t confiscated, and looked for him in my contacts. Nothing there. Wait, that's unusual, why wouldn’t I have his phone number saved? I asked the admin lady if she knew where Sam was.  \n\nShe raised an eyebrow and said: “I don’t know who that is.”\n\nAnd I said, “He’s in my grade. C’mon, he’s - “ - I started to describe his appearance, but suddenly I couldn’t remember the color of his hair. Was he tall? Maybe he was my height? I grasped his face desperately, but all I could conjure up was an abyss. A terrible dark and deep abyss. \n\nThe admin lady clicked her tongue. “Last name?”\n\n“His name is Sam - “, I started to say. But I stuttered on my words. Sam… Sam who? \n\nThe admin lady shook her head. “Stop playing games with me. Go home.” I found myself at a loss for words. His name is… He… \n\n“Sorry, Ma’am,” I said, “I don’t remember why I’m here.” My gut was shifting and twisting; my hands trembling. Suddenly, the office seemed to come crashing down on top of me. I darted and kept going until I was out of breath. I leaned forward, retching, struggling to catch my breath. Somehow, I could not calm my nerves. It was the middle of autumn, yet I was dripping sweat. \n\nFrom the corner of my eye I caught Mr. Jenkin’s 3rd storey open window. Some terrible curiosity overcame me and I turned slowly to peek inside. My jaw dropped. My heart pounded like a jackhammer. My eyes were interlocked with Mr Jenkins who stared at me with blank eyes but a foul grin. . What little remnants of his hair was left was tattered. Then his teeth fell out. I had no idea he wore dentures, but they slipped out of the window and landed in the garden bed below. He began pulling the remainder of his hair bit by bit. I tried to move towards his office, but it was as though I was caught in stinking sand. Instead, I called for help. Please, someone help the poor guy. But no words escaped my mouth. Nothing. My larynx was straining itself, but the words just dissipated into nothingness. And then things took a turn. His face began melting. I don’t know how else to describe it. Literally, his skin was dropping off his skeleton, dripping away like drops of water. \n\nMy phone rang. I realized I could move my arms so I pulled it out. A private number. Odd, since only my mother ever called me. But I answered it anyway. \n\n“Help me,” a familiar voice said. A voice belonging to a person who’s name I could not recall. Who’s face I could not conjure up. \n\n“W-w-who are you?” my voice quivered. \n\n“We’re best friends, what do you mean?!” the voice snapped in anger. \n\n“S-s-stop m-m-making fun o-o-of me!” I yelled back. There was no response. The phone was cut out. When I looked back up, Mr. Jenkins was gone. In his place, a teenager I didn’t recognize was standing there looking at me. He seemed a little curious maybe. He sort of, I don’t know, maybe he looked like me? Which was ridiculous of course. I was definitely imagining things. I decided to ignore this whole thing and head home. \n\nAt night my brother hogged the TV all night playing Fortnite with his mates. I let him be. I didn’t have anyone to play games with anyway. No one would play with me. They all thought I was weird. And no one would be able to stand me stuttering into the microphone. So I just went to my room. I am my best company, I thought to myself. \n\nThat night, I started browsing twitter as usual. Since I didn’t have any friends, I found myself stalking the people in my classes and studying their behavior online. But tonight, someone posted a crude image they made in Microsoft Paint. An ugly image. A balding middle aged man with buck teeth. I clenched my fist. It was me, of course. I started hammering out a comment, but none of my words seemed strong enough to bother with. Frustrating. I wanted to punch my monitor. \n\nIt isn’t fair. Why am I like this? Why is my hairline already receding at just fifteen years old?! Why is my face already full of wrinkles like a middle aged man? Why do I stutter so badly? The thought of going to school again to face the bullying just made me sick to my stomach. I just really, really, do not want to go to school again. To have to sit by myself at lunch. To speak with a stutter so bad that no one can stand to listen to me. Why can’t I speak with a clear voice that commands your attention? Like Mr. Jenkins the school principal. I don’t get it.\n\nThat’s why I’m posting this thread on reddit. As per the title, I need advice on making friends. How can I stop stuttering so people will take me seriously? Is there anything I can do about my teeth or my hair? I really, really, don’t want to go to school anymore.\n\nPlease help.",

        "text": " \n\n“This is a bag of dicks,” shouted Mairo as the armor truck bounced and banged down the old road. “Why are we doing this again?”\n\n“Because the boss wants it done. I know it was a last minute customer, but he’s paying out the butt for us to come pick up his money.” I yelled back at Mario.\n\n“I did not spend twenty five years in the United States Marine Corps to have my back blown out in a beat up P.O.S. truck on some godforsaken backroad in the northwoods Alex.” Why could we not have the nicer truck? Oh yeah, because someone blew a tire out on it and it’s still at the shop waiting to get repaired.” He said, his voice dripping with disdain.\n\n“Oh sure, blame me. I didn’t do anything, I wasn't the driver.” I shot back.\n\n“Well who else am I going to blame? Mike quit and that just leaves you.”\n\n“It’s just around the corner. Look, I can see the welcome sign,” I said. Next to the road was a twenty foot wooden cutout of an old western prosecutor resting his arms on the handle of a pickaxe with a speech bubble saying, *Silver head mine tours- just turn left in 200 feet to go down as deep at 9,000 feet*. A smaller sign next to it read, *Haunted mine tours every weekend in October.* Mairo let out a snort and said \"We are up north, why is there a western style prosecutor on the sign and a second thing the prosecutor is the one looking for gold and the miners mine it? That just doesn’t make sense.”\n\n“Let’s just get this stop done and go home. It will be sundown soon and I don’t want to be out here In the dark.” I said. We pulled into the parking lot of the mine and saw what appeared to be a giant tower above the tall trees surrounding it. The mine elevator tower with its exposed metal frame looked like some long lost relic from a forgotten time. Next to the tower was a log cabin building that had a white painted sign that said *Cook Shanty* which was squeezed between the building and tower as if it was an afterthought. A small, free standing building that said *Tickets* stood nearby. Mairo stopped the truck between a small two story cabin and the cook shanty.\n\nI hopped out of the truck and turned to Mairo. “Hey Buddy, you want anything while I’m in there? Maybe some crayons to eat? I know you Marines love to eat crayons,” I quipped.\n\n“Hey,” Mario snapped back, “You never served in the armed forces, you don’t get to make fun of them, and the Salvation Army does not count as the army.”\n\nI flipped Mairo the bird and closed the truck door.\n\nI walked up to the ticket booth to the sound of thumbs tapping away on a phone accompanied by the soft hum of a single overhead light bulb. An attractive, fit, blond woman was behind the thin pane of glass inside the booth. Without looking up from her phone she said, “Can I help you?” The constant tapping sounded like she was going for a speed record of typing *War and Peace* on her phone.\n\n“Yeah, I’m here to do a cash pick up. I was wondering if you could tell me where the cash office is.” The woman, whose name was Samantha, according to her nametag, looked up at me.\n\nShe gave me a wicked grin and said, “Oh, it’s in the mine. You’ll have to take the elevator and walk down the tunnel until you see a door on your right. You can head right in. They….. I mean Mark will be waiting for you.”\n\nI walked back to the truck to tell Mario the plan and then headed for the elevator.\n\nAs I walked up to the elevator tower, I could see that the metal frame was all scratched up as if some monster attacked it. This immediately put me on edge. I scanned the tree line as I walked, leery of my surroundings as always. I stepped into the elevator. The floor and ceiling was made of plexiglass or some other transparent material. A down, up, and stop button were the only controls in the elevator. I closed the doors and pressed the down button. The elevator went down flawlessly for a few hundred feet then stopped. A loud bang echoed through the shaft so loud I thought it was a gunshot. I looked up at the glass ceiling and to my horror the cables attached to the top of the elevator began to break one by one. It was terrifying to watch. Every time a cable broke, the elevator would fall a few feet. With one cable remaining, I watched as the elevator groaned and shifted. Then with one last POP, the cable broke and the elevator began rocking towards the bottom at terminal velocity. The end of the cables whipped around the slipstream. The breaks on the side activated and sparks flew everywhere. With the speed and force of a free fall, the brakes were ripped off the elevator. Looking down, I could see the bottom approaching fast. *This is how you go out Alex, in an elevator. Man, my wife will not be happy about this.* I thought. I could feel tears run down my cheeks, knowing I had but seconds left on this earth to live. I said a prayer and at the last second I jumped into the air.\n\nThe elevator came to a fast but safe stop. I looked up to see the ceiling which was now black. A voice from the speakers said, “Thank you for riding the runway elevator. We hope you enjoy the rest of your tour at the cursed Silver Head Mine.”\n\nI opened the doors, stepped out of the elevator and almost collapsed on the cold mine floor. My hands were shaking. *Not freaking funny,* I thought to myself as I stood there regaining my composure. I took out my cell phone ready to call the boss and tell him I’m done. Too bad so sad for this money pickup. It was then that I noticed I had no service this far underground. *Might as well get this over with,* I thought as I began shakily walking. I came across a TV mounted to the rock wall of the mine. A green flashing button that said, “Play” caught my attention. *Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime. That’s why I watch TV on company time.* I figured why not and decided to press the play button.\n\nCheesy western music started up along with pictures of the mine as the narration began. “Back in 1869,” *Ha 69 nice,* I laughed to myself. “This mine was started by a man named Gorge Ravenswood better known by his friends as Henry. The mine soon became prosperous. One day a sinkhole appeared on the surface. The Native Americans assumed it was because the mine was cursed with Wiowalks. These creatures have been described as a half man half praying mantis with a rattlesnake tail. They make the sound of a hissing cat and are said to suck the soul out of any man, woman, or child it encounters. An earthquake trapped several miners in the mine. George bravely led the rescue party himself and died during the rescue mission of the trapped miners. Some say the ‘Curse of the Wiowalks’ still exists and was cited for the number of disappearances throughout the national park.”\n\nI finished listening and let out a snort. I started walking and thought, “*I feel like I’m not getting the full story. Either that or they are using a so-called curse to cover up for poor mine safety.* I walked down the mine tunnel and stopped once I reached the fork where it split into two different tunnels. *The pretty blond said to go to the left and open the first door on the right.* I took the tunnel to the left, on my way past old mining equipment and a TV with a green button next to it. I pressed the button and the TV turned on. This time, the video gave information about the equipment and how it was used. I was walking for a while when I heard a hiss like escaping air. I walked towards the sound and saw an old pneumatic drill leaking air. I continued walking down the mineshaft and heard another hissing sound. *Must just be another piece of mining equipment.* Well, I looked around and did not see anything. I discovered that the sound was coming from a smaller tunnel on the left. I shined my flashlight into it and was able to make out a quick flash of white going upwards which was followed by small rocks falling down.\n\n“What the hell was that?” I said to myself as I brought my hand down slowly to my pistol holster at my hip. Just resting my hand on it gave me the reassurance that I could handle anything down here, curse or not. I walked for a while longer and was about to give up and walk back when I saw a figure. It was tall and built like a house with a high and tight haircut. He turned and looked at me, but before I could call out to him he turned right and walked out of sight. I swear he just walked into the wall of the mine. I quickly moved to find him and found a door on the right side of the mine. Above the door, carved in old wood was the word, *Bathhouse*. I pushed the door open and began to walk down the dark tunnel.\n\nI began walking down the dark tunnel. My boots echoed off the mine shaft walls. *How far does this tunnel go and what happened to the guy I just saw?* I wondered to myself. I could hear a faint sound growing louder with each step. I walked into an open cavern to the sound of a waterfall. I shined my flashlight all around and down into a lake below. I let out a whistle. “That's a long way down,” I said out loud as I shuffled to the edge of the cliff. A few light bulbs illuminated the steps that were carved out of stone that led to a rock slab below. *Where did this guy go? This place is a dead end, maybe he went…* My thoughts were interrupted when a sound that was very off putting could be heard. It sounded like popcorn popping mixed with the sound of an old creaking door. I felt the ground shift. I pointed my flashlight down in time to see a crack form in the rock. I spun on my heels, preparing to run. As I pushed off with my back leg, my brain registered the horrifying feeling of nothing below my feet, followed by the sensation of freefall.\n\nThe forty foot fall lasted about a second and a half before I hit the water. This gave me just enough time to cross my feet and tuck my arms against my chest. I did not know how deep the water was, but I figured being a human lawn dart was my best move. My flashlight still clutched in my left hand smacked into my face when I hit the water. I tried my best to stay calm but with the inky blackness of the water I could not tell what way was up. Luckily the flashlight still worked. I dropped it and saw it fall up. *Oh crap I must be upside down.* I managed to grab the flashlight before it fell out of my reach and I accidentally turned it off. I began swimming for all my worth. It felt like I was getting nowhere. *I have to ditch my vest* I thought. I reluctantly undid the quick release straps and let it fall below. I was almost to the surface when I felt my foot catch on something. I looked down and screamed as a large, pale white hand wrapped around my leg. I hit it twice with my flashlight, but with the angle I was at, I could not get any power behind my swings. I was running out of air, and blackness started filling my vision. It was like looking through a keyhole. \n\nThe lack of oxygen to my brain was causing me to hallucinate images of my wife and dogs. When a hand shot into the water, I grabbed it and the person started to pull. My head broke the surface and I gasped for air. I got one big lung full before I got pulled back under the water by whatever had my leg. I kicked as hard as I could at the inhuman size hand and keeped a grip on the person's arm as if my life depended on it, which it did. The hand let go of my leg and I was pulled out of the water. I crawled onto the hard rocks. I coughed and hacked up water and was able to regain my breath. Rolling onto my back, I managed to croak out a thank you between coughs. I shined my flashlight at my savior. It was a female with long, jet black hair. When she opened her eyes, emerald green looked back at me. I gasped and dropped my flashlight. It hit the hard stone ground and winked out. I heard a voice whisper out of the darkness and into my ear, “Bye officer.”\n\nI fumbled around in the dark until I found my flash light and turned it on. The room was empty. I looked all around but no one was there. It was like she vanished . My legs were shaking and I sat down on a rock next to the underground lake. I know those eyes. I've seen those eyes before. Then it hit me like a freight train at full speed. The last time I saw her was roughly eight years ago, on the last traffic stop I did. On what could only have been the last normal day of my life. As I sat on a rock thinking about that day, I put the flashlight between my legs on the ground with its beam pointed at the lake. Suddenly, a wet smack echoed on the rocks. I looked down to see the large, pale white hand. It was the same hand that tried to keep me under the water. Another loud smack sounded as a second hand appeared on the rocks near me. A pale white head slowly appeared from out of the water. I noticed that it had no eyes, just a mouth and small slits where its nose should be. Behind the creature, a rattlesnake tail broke the surface and began to shake. I sat there, more fascinated than scared of the monster. When it got about two feet from me it tilted its head sideways like a curious puppy might do. I felt a light tug as if something was pulling towards the creature's open mouth. I began to feel weak. My skin looked sickly and pale. It’s hard to explain, but it felt like my energy was being pulled from my body. I had to act fast since I could feel my body becoming weaker. I smoothly pulled out my sidearm, pointed it at this thing’s head. My muzzle was only a few inches away as I fired.\n\nThe Wiowalk’s head flung back and almost instantly it felt like my being was snapped back into my body. It was like it was attached to a rubber band. The color returned to my skin along with a resurgence of energy. It felt like I slammed a Rip-It energy drink. The Wiowalk’s head slowly moved back to face me with a wickedly evil grin on its face. I could see the small 40 caliber hole that was dead center on its forehead. It began to open its mouth and I fired two more rounds into its large forehead. The Wiowalk began to sway in the water as if he was drunk. I shot it four more times. The hands that were gripping the rocking floor lost their hold and the creature's lifeless body flopped into the water with all the grace of a ten year old pushed off the high dive at the public pool.\n\n“Well look at that, I killed the Wiowalk. The curse is broken, I’m a hero!” I shouted at the top of my lungs. I heard a splash and spun around to see three more of them now standing on the rocks. They were eight feet tall and ugly as all get out. I fired two rounds into each of the Wiowalks. They swayed as before but did not go down. I fired two more times and then the slide on my pistol locked back. They must have known my Glock was empty somehow because as I was trying to change magazines they rushed me. Knowing I was not going to be able to reload in time, I scooped up the flashlight and threw it at the closest Wiowalk. It sailed harmlessly past him and clattered onto the ground behind them. I closed my eyes and held my breath waiting for the impact to knock me over but nothing happened. I opened my eyes and it was pitch black. I activated my weapon's light, and I saw the three Wiowalks near the flashlight I threw. I shined my weapon’s light right at them but they did not notice. I turned the light to strobe, turning the whole cave into one big ass techno club, but still nothing. *They must locate their prey based on sound* I realized.\n\nI slowly made my way up the steps and out of the cave. I was two steps from the top when I felt my nose tickle. A sneeze was coming. I tried my hardest to hold it back. My nose began to burn and my eyes watered. Unable to stop it, I let out a loud sneeze. That alerted every Wiowalk in the cave. *Crap!* I shouted in my head as I took off running to the sound of sharp claws on stone closing in on me fast. I reached the end of the tunnel and went right back down the way I came. I slipped on a wet patch of the floor of the tunnel and fell. This caused me to grip down harder on my pistol and my finger slipped into the trigger guard and resulted in an accidental discharge. *That's piss poor trigger discipline Alex*. I thought I saw the round skim along the ground, hit a rock and ricochet around the tunnel. The Wiowalks stopped and their heads snapped back and forth trying to get a fix on the sound of the bullet as it bounced off the hard surface of the tunnel. *Ok maybe I can get out of this.* I was hopeful until I slowly and quietly got to my feet and saw dozens upon dozens of the creatures crammed shoulder to shoulder with each other along with a few of them crawling on the ceiling of the tunnel.\n\nOne of the Wiowalks locked onto me. I don’t know if it was the sound of my breath or just bad luck, but it let out a hiss and lunged. I pointed my pistol at a forty-five degree angle from the tunnel wall and fired. The sound from the gun discharging was overwhelming and the discomfort to my ears almost caused me to scream in pain. I could not hear it, but from the way the Wiowalks heads were moving I knew my bullet was bouncing off the walls. This gave me the few seconds I needed to run. I was in fairly good shape and with my bullet resistant vest now somewhere at the bottom of the lake, it made running much easier. I was going at a dead sprint with what can only be described as military grade tendinitis ringing in my ear. Not wanting to look back, I did a ten count in my head and cracked a round off behind me. It must have worked. The mind does some crazy thing under stress. I actually started laughing thinking about how this was just like my experience in the northwoods.\n\n“Hey, if it’s not broken don’t fix it,” I said, although I was unable to hear my words thanks to the gunshot. I could see the elevator up ahead when one of the Wiowalks came out from a hole in the tunnel’s ceiling and landed in front of me. I fired a round at the wall behind me and brought the pistol around to fire in front of me. I pulled the trigger but nothing happened. Out of instinct and years of training, muscle memory kicked in. I brought the gun up to my face, tapped the mag, and rolled the gun so the ejection port was facing down and racked the slide. The undischarged round ejected out and the slide locked back. I released the empty mag, inserted a fresh magazine and racked the slide. This occurred a lot faster than the time it would take to explain my actions. With the pistol back in battery, I pointed it at the Wiowalk. While still running, I shot every round in the magazine but missed a lot out of the fifteen rounds. I think three might have hit the Wiowalk’s center mass, which did nothing to the demon. I had just enough time to holster my pistol, put my head down and body check the creature. Given the mass and size of the Wiowalk, I pushed it back a foot and stopped. I felt its long, bony fingers wrap around the back of my duty belt and pick me up. I was face to face with the Wiowalk. It tilted its head at me and looked at me quizzically. I thought about going with my sidearm but because it's out of ammo, that little voice in the back of my head told me I would not be fast enough. I could see that one of my bullets hit the Wiowalk’s upper cheek. Black, almost oil-like liquid oozed out of the wound. The Wiowalk lifted his tail and rattled it back and forth as if to call the others.\n\nI was trying to stay calm, just knowing that any sudden movement would cause the Wiowalk to attack. I could not figure out why it held me here suspended in the air. Was it waiting for the others to show up? All of this raced around in my mind as my hand brushed against the pocket on my tactical pants. *The magazine.* The empty mag from my pistol was in my pocket. I took it out and an idea formed in my head. I started banging the baseplate of the mag against the steel toe of my work boot. The spring inside the mag was letting out what I assumed was a twang with each hit. Twang…..twang…..twang. His mouth opened and I could feel life being drained from my body. A sound like a waterfall came out of me. I felt my body get flung forward, the grip on my duty belt slipping off the Wiowalk’s hands. \n\nI landed hard on the ground, quickly rolled over and I could see what looked like three or four of the Wiowalks entangled on the ground. I took the empty mag and threw it as far as I could. *I can’t believe that worked,* I thought to myself. The Wiowalks that were chasing me heard the twang of my empty magazines hitting my boot and just attacked the sound, which happened to be the Wiowalk that was holding me. I ran to the elevator and closed the gate as the creatures were starting to untangle themselves. More started to come towards me and to my horror I saw that one of the bullets I fired at a dead run found its mark. It was dead center in the elevator control panel. The up button was intact thank god, but the stop and down button were obliterated. I pressed the up button so hard I could feel my thumb pop. The elevator rocketed upward. I flipped them the bird as the Wiowalks began to shrink below me.\n\nOnce the elevator reached the top, I got out and started to speed walk away. My ears were still ringing. It was a loud buzzing sound that made everything sound like I had a wool blanket wrapped around my head. I then remembered my sidearm. I stopped walking to reload it. As I did so, I noticed something odd. All the clicks and clacks you would expect to hear were not there. It was like someone just turned my life on mute. Just then, I heard a muffled sound like someone yelling. I had just holstered my gun when I heard it again. Looking up, I realized that I was in line with the cook shanty, the armored truck was barely visible. The dome light was on but no one was in the driver’s seat.\n\nI heard the same voice from the mine whisper to me again, “Run you idiot!” I took off at a sprint toward the armored truck. I managed a few steps, before I saw movement in the shadows between the armored truck and the cook shanty. A figure appeared holding a rifle and leveling it at me. It was then that I heard a voice clear as day. This voice sounded like it belonged to someone who spent most of their existence yelling at people. Someone who used to give orders.\n\nThe voice yelled, “ALEX, DOWN NOW!” I dove to the ground as fast as I could, actually getting mad that gravity would not let me fall faster. A thunderous BOOM… BOOM… BOOM from a rifle could be heard as it began to fire a slow steady boom like the bass at a nightclub. I looked up to see two very well polished boots at eye level with me, followed by hot metal which landed on my neck. I rolled over to see Mairo with his M1a Socom, which is a shorter modern version of the US military's M14. The stock was against his shoulder and his shooting posture was perfect. He was banging away with that rifle, a shot being fired every second like the world’s deadliest metronome. He swapped out his empty magazine in a blur and continued firing. With each muzzle flash, I could see his face like a snapshot. Each time the rifle boomed, he was grinning from ear to ear which made him look thirty years younger. He was a happy Marine.",

        "text": " \n\n“This is a bag of dicks,” shouted Mairo as the armor truck bounced and banged down the old road. “Why are we doing this again?”\n\n“Because the boss wants it done. I know it was a last minute customer, but he’s paying out the butt for us to come pick up his money.” I yelled back at Mario.\n\n“I did not spend twenty five years in the United States Marine Corps to have my back blown out in a beat up P.O.S. truck on some godforsaken backroad in the northwoods Alex.” Why could we not have the nicer truck? Oh yeah, because someone blew a tire out on it and it’s still at the shop waiting to get repaired.” He said, his voice dripping with disdain.\n\n“Oh sure, blame me. I didn’t do anything, I wasn't the driver.” I shot back.\n\n“Well who else am I going to blame? Mike quit and that just leaves you.”\n\n“It’s just around the corner. Look, I can see the welcome sign,” I said. Next to the road was a twenty foot wooden cutout of an old western prosecutor resting his arms on the handle of a pickaxe with a speech bubble saying, *Silver head mine tours- just turn left in 200 feet to go down as deep at 9,000 feet*. A smaller sign next to it read, *Haunted mine tours every weekend in October.* Mairo let out a snort and said \"We are up north, why is there a western style prosecutor on the sign and a second thing the prosecutor is the one looking for gold and the miners mine it? That just doesn’t make sense.”\n\n“Let’s just get this stop done and go home. It will be sundown soon and I don’t want to be out here In the dark.” I said. We pulled into the parking lot of the mine and saw what appeared to be a giant tower above the tall trees surrounding it. The mine elevator tower with its exposed metal frame looked like some long lost relic from a forgotten time. Next to the tower was a log cabin building that had a white painted sign that said *Cook Shanty* which was squeezed between the building and tower as if it was an afterthought. A small, free standing building that said *Tickets* stood nearby. Mairo stopped the truck between a small two story cabin and the cook shanty.\n\nI hopped out of the truck and turned to Mairo. “Hey Buddy, you want anything while I’m in there? Maybe some crayons to eat? I know you Marines love to eat crayons,” I quipped.\n\n“Hey,” Mario snapped back, “You never served in the armed forces, you don’t get to make fun of them, and the Salvation Army does not count as the army.”\n\nI flipped Mairo the bird and closed the truck door.\n\nI walked up to the ticket booth to the sound of thumbs tapping away on a phone accompanied by the soft hum of a single overhead light bulb. An attractive, fit, blond woman was behind the thin pane of glass inside the booth. Without looking up from her phone she said, “Can I help you?” The constant tapping sounded like she was going for a speed record of typing *War and Peace* on her phone.\n\n“Yeah, I’m here to do a cash pick up. I was wondering if you could tell me where the cash office is.” The woman, whose name was Samantha, according to her nametag, looked up at me.\n\nShe gave me a wicked grin and said, “Oh, it’s in the mine. You’ll have to take the elevator and walk down the tunnel until you see a door on your right. You can head right in. They….. I mean Mark will be waiting for you.”\n\nI walked back to the truck to tell Mario the plan and then headed for the elevator.\n\nAs I walked up to the elevator tower, I could see that the metal frame was all scratched up as if some monster attacked it. This immediately put me on edge. I scanned the tree line as I walked, leery of my surroundings as always. I stepped into the elevator. The floor and ceiling was made of plexiglass or some other transparent material. A down, up, and stop button were the only controls in the elevator. I closed the doors and pressed the down button. The elevator went down flawlessly for a few hundred feet then stopped. A loud bang echoed through the shaft so loud I thought it was a gunshot. I looked up at the glass ceiling and to my horror the cables attached to the top of the elevator began to break one by one. It was terrifying to watch. Every time a cable broke, the elevator would fall a few feet. With one cable remaining, I watched as the elevator groaned and shifted. Then with one last POP, the cable broke and the elevator began rocking towards the bottom at terminal velocity. The end of the cables whipped around the slipstream. The breaks on the side activated and sparks flew everywhere. With the speed and force of a free fall, the brakes were ripped off the elevator. Looking down, I could see the bottom approaching fast. *This is how you go out Alex, in an elevator. Man, my wife will not be happy about this.* I thought. I could feel tears run down my cheeks, knowing I had but seconds left on this earth to live. I said a prayer and at the last second I jumped into the air.\n\nThe elevator came to a fast but safe stop. I looked up to see the ceiling which was now black. A voice from the speakers said, “Thank you for riding the runway elevator. We hope you enjoy the rest of your tour at the cursed Silver Head Mine.”\n\nI opened the doors, stepped out of the elevator and almost collapsed on the cold mine floor. My hands were shaking. *Not freaking funny,* I thought to myself as I stood there regaining my composure. I took out my cell phone ready to call the boss and tell him I’m done. Too bad so sad for this money pickup. It was then that I noticed I had no service this far underground. *Might as well get this over with,* I thought as I began shakily walking. I came across a TV mounted to the rock wall of the mine. A green flashing button that said, “Play” caught my attention. *Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime. That’s why I watch TV on company time.* I figured why not and decided to press the play button.\n\nCheesy western music started up along with pictures of the mine as the narration began. “Back in 1869,” *Ha 69 nice,* I laughed to myself. “This mine was started by a man named Gorge Ravenswood better known by his friends as Henry. The mine soon became prosperous. One day a sinkhole appeared on the surface. The Native Americans assumed it was because the mine was cursed with Wiowalks. These creatures have been described as a half man half praying mantis with a rattlesnake tail. They make the sound of a hissing cat and are said to suck the soul out of any man, woman, or child it encounters. An earthquake trapped several miners in the mine. George bravely led the rescue party himself and died during the rescue mission of the trapped miners. Some say the ‘Curse of the Wiowalks’ still exists and was cited for the number of disappearances throughout the national park.”\n\nI finished listening and let out a snort. I started walking and thought, “*I feel like I’m not getting the full story. Either that or they are using a so-called curse to cover up for poor mine safety.* I walked down the mine tunnel and stopped once I reached the fork where it split into two different tunnels. *The pretty blond said to go to the left and open the first door on the right.* I took the tunnel to the left, on my way past old mining equipment and a TV with a green button next to it. I pressed the button and the TV turned on. This time, the video gave information about the equipment and how it was used. I was walking for a while when I heard a hiss like escaping air. I walked towards the sound and saw an old pneumatic drill leaking air. I continued walking down the mineshaft and heard another hissing sound. *Must just be another piece of mining equipment.* Well, I looked around and did not see anything. I discovered that the sound was coming from a smaller tunnel on the left. I shined my flashlight into it and was able to make out a quick flash of white going upwards which was followed by small rocks falling down.\n\n“What the hell was that?” I said to myself as I brought my hand down slowly to my pistol holster at my hip. Just resting my hand on it gave me the reassurance that I could handle anything down here, curse or not. I walked for a while longer and was about to give up and walk back when I saw a figure. It was tall and built like a house with a high and tight haircut. He turned and looked at me, but before I could call out to him he turned right and walked out of sight. I swear he just walked into the wall of the mine. I quickly moved to find him and found a door on the right side of the mine. Above the door, carved in old wood was the word, *Bathhouse*. I pushed the door open and began to walk down the dark tunnel.\n\nI began walking down the dark tunnel. My boots echoed off the mine shaft walls. *How far does this tunnel go and what happened to the guy I just saw?* I wondered to myself. I could hear a faint sound growing louder with each step. I walked into an open cavern to the sound of a waterfall. I shined my flashlight all around and down into a lake below. I let out a whistle. “That's a long way down,” I said out loud as I shuffled to the edge of the cliff. A few light bulbs illuminated the steps that were carved out of stone that led to a rock slab below. *Where did this guy go? This place is a dead end, maybe he went…* My thoughts were interrupted when a sound that was very off putting could be heard. It sounded like popcorn popping mixed with the sound of an old creaking door. I felt the ground shift. I pointed my flashlight down in time to see a crack form in the rock. I spun on my heels, preparing to run. As I pushed off with my back leg, my brain registered the horrifying feeling of nothing below my feet, followed by the sensation of freefall.\n\nThe forty foot fall lasted about a second and a half before I hit the water. This gave me just enough time to cross my feet and tuck my arms against my chest. I did not know how deep the water was, but I figured being a human lawn dart was my best move. My flashlight still clutched in my left hand smacked into my face when I hit the water. I tried my best to stay calm but with the inky blackness of the water I could not tell what way was up.

I could see that one of my bullets hit the Wiowalk’s upper cheek. Black, almost oil-like liquid oozed out of the wound. The Wiowalk lifted his tail and rattled it back and forth as if to call the others.\n\nI was trying to stay calm, just knowing that any sudden movement would cause the Wiowalk to attack. I could not figure out why it held me here suspended in the air. Was it waiting for the others to show up? All of this raced around in my mind as my hand brushed against the pocket on my tactical pants. *The magazine.* The empty mag from my pistol was in my pocket. I took it out and an idea formed in my head. I started banging the baseplate of the mag against the steel toe of my work boot. The spring inside the mag was letting out what I assumed was a twang with each hit. Twang…..twang…..twang. His mouth opened and I could feel life being drained from my body. A sound like a waterfall came out of me. I felt my body get flung forward, the grip on my duty belt slipping off the Wiowalk’s hands. I landed hard on the ground, quickly rolled over and I could see what looked like three or four of the Wiowalks entangled on the ground. I took the empty mag and threw it as far as I could. *I can’t believe that worked,* I thought to myself. The Wiowalks that were chasing me heard the twang of my empty magazines hitting my boot and just attacked the sound, which happened to be the Wiowalk that was holding me. I ran to the elevator and closed the gate as the creatures were starting to untangle themselves. More started to come towards me and to my horror I saw that one of the bullets I fired at a dead run found its mark. It was dead center in the elevator control panel. The up button was intact thank god, but the stop and down button were obliterated. I pressed the up button so hard I could feel my thumb pop. The elevator rocketed upward. I flipped them the bird as the Wiowalks began to shrink below me.\n\nOnce the elevator reached the top, I got out and started to speed walk away. My ears were still ringing. It was a loud buzzing sound that made everything sound like I had a wool blanket wrapped around my head. I then remembered my sidearm. I stopped walking to reload it. As I did so, I noticed something odd. All the clicks and clacks you would expect to hear were not there. It was like someone just turned my life on mute. Just then, I heard a muffled sound like someone yelling. I had just holstered my gun when I heard it again. Looking up, I realized that I was in line with the cook shanty, the armored truck was barely visible. The dome light was on but no one was in the driver’s seat.\n\nI heard the same voice from the mine whisper to me again, “Run you idiot!” I took off at a sprint toward the armored truck. I managed a few steps, before I saw movement in the shadows between the armored truck and the cook shanty. A figure appeared holding a rifle and leveling it at me. It was then that I heard a voice clear as day. This voice sounded like it belonged to someone who spent most of their existence yelling at people. Someone who used to give orders.\n\nThe voice yelled, “ALEX, DOWN NOW!” I dove to the ground as fast as I could, actually getting mad that gravity would not let me fall faster. A thunderous BOOM… BOOM… BOOM from a rifle could be heard as it began to fire a slow steady boom like the bass at a nightclub. I looked up to see two very well polished boots at eye level with me, followed by hot metal which landed on my neck. I rolled over to see Mairo with his M1a Socom, which is a shorter modern version of the US military's M14. The stock was against his shoulder and his shooting posture was perfect. He was banging away with that rifle, a shot being fired every second like the world’s deadliest metronome. He swapped out his empty magazine in a blur and continued firing. With each muzzle flash, I could see his face like a snapshot. Each time the rifle boomed, he was grinning from ear to ear which made him look thirty years younger. He was a happy Marine.",

        "text": "This is my last year at a state university with a large campus town that is a part of the actual city. Growing up in the suburbs, I had to adjust to living in a more urban environment. Despite this I was excited, high off of the idea of being in college and so far from home.\n\nOver the course of my first semester my roommates and I became familiar with the area, strolling down the main street, eating out, and hitting the bars way more than we should've. Everything we needed was in walking distance including convenience stores, fast-food restaurants, bars, a gym, friends' dorms, and our classes. \n\nThe university also has an excellent bus transit service but I never got used to public transportation and preferred to walk. The longest you would ever need to travel by foot is about 25 minutes but it's rare and you get used to it.\n\nHowever, what caught me the most by surprise was the amount of homeless in the area.\n\nWalking along the main street of campus or even on your way to class, depending on where you live, it is not uncommon to pass a few beggars. They'll usually be posted near an entrance to a store or by an alleyway, every so often rattling their change-filled cups and offering a meek 'god bless.'\n\nLuckily, my parents raised me well and I had no problem with them, always trying to donate a loose buck or two if I could spare it and even stopping to chat if I had the time.\n\nThere are a few regulars that I eventually recognized every time I went out. Pat; a frail old lady always perched on the knee-high railing outside of the Walgreens. I gave her my french-fries once coming back from McDonalds and she smiled at me with features too small for her face. Jeffrey is the short tempered bum who always finds himself outside the bars when the sun sets, giving and receiving heckles from the frat kids in line. The police usually pick him up by the nights end.\n\nI felt an extreme sense of empathy towards the homeless. I understand that all it takes is one bad choice and any one of us could be on the streets, begging for a loose dime. On that same note, it took some time to comprehend that most of the money you give will be spent on drugs and booze. It's a difficult situation to be in, with the stigma and all, but I did my best to put myself in their shoes.\n\nIt was most likely because of this empathy that my life became a diabolical nightmare during the winter of my freshman year.\n\nIt didn't take long for me to develop mild insomnia and a completely reversed sleep schedule. For a period of a few months, I would sleep through my classes waking around 4 P.M. I'd recover and eat something before walking to my sister's apartment, who is two years older than me, to spend the night smoking weed and watching movies. When I was too baked to think straight and after my sister fell into a kush coma, I would walk back to my dorm at about 4 A.M.\n\nThe walk was only 10 minutes and along main roads for a good deal of it, although the cold during winter made it a brutal process. \n\nWhen January rolled around I had returned to campus from winter break and was taking things easy because it was the start of a new semester. After a couple weeks though I was back to my routine, waking late, sleeping early, and smoking in between. \n\nThat night my sister was snoring so loudly, that it was beginning to annoy me. I remember I looked at the time on my phone and saw the numbers **3:09 AM** illuminate my face. My sister seemed content to snore as loud as physically possible so I packed my laptop into my backpack, threw on my timbs and left.\n\nThe cold hit me as soon as I opened the door to the apartment building. It passed through my clothes like they weren't even there, the wind invading every inch of my skin as I began to walk. The night was unnaturally dark, complementing the freezing temperature well, and wrapping me in a pitch black bear hug.\n\nA creeping unease settled as I got further from my sister's apartment. When I first started going out in the early hours of morning, I did have some phobias of getting mugged or murdered but those fears lessened after doing it so often. There really isn't anyone out that late, and if by chance you do see somebody, you mind your own business and keep your head down.\n\nI eventually turned onto one of the main streets, and I felt my shoulders loosen slightly. The night felt lifeless, and I took solace in the red hue that the traffic lights cast every two seconds or so from the intersection behind me.\n\nThe rhythmic scraping of my boots as they sliced at the frigid sidewalk was my only form of companionship. The streets, stores, apartments, even the air; all empty.\n\nMy body warmed at the sight of the halfway point ahead. A lone streetlamp, blinking quite fast, unfixed for the better part of a year. The familiar sight made me want to increase my pace. Instead I decelerated my gait to a slow creep, and soon stopped moving altogether.\n\nSomeone was sitting beneath the streetlamp. It was very difficult to make out any features from where I was standing, about 25 yards away, due to the strobe-like effect the light was inducing. \n\n*Flash*: A hunched figure \n\n*Click*: It melts back into the darkness \n\nOver and over at a quick pace.\n\nI hesitated for a good 20 seconds, too uncomfortable to stand still but too nervous to move. I was afraid, but scolding myself internally, I forced a step forward. I had promised myself I wouldn't be a coward anymore when I got to college. High school was difficult for me and I was exhausted of being scared of others. \n\nIn that moment I had forgotten that fear is a primal emotion. Fear has served the human race, a loyal ally, warning of things we can't understand and of forces we are no match for. \n\nAnother step, and I had found my pace, matching the strobe flash of the street lamp.\n\n*Flash, Click;* Step; *Flash, Click;* Step; *Flash, Click;* Step.\n\nAfter a few strides I could tell it was a woman, and based off her disheveled appearance and visible age, I safely concluded she was homeless. \n\nI began to sympathize. The closer I got the more features I picked up on, catching glimpses every time the streetlamp flashed.\n\n*Flash;* black, wild hair; *Click;* Step; *Flash;* no shoes on her feet; *Click;* Step; *Flash;* her eyes- \n\nI stopped again. What the hell was wrong with her eyes.\n\nThe street lamp flickered and the woman, in the split second between light flashes, now had her head twisted in my direction. I didn't register any movement. One moment she had her head held up in the direction of the street, and now she was staring directly at me.\n\nExcept she wasn't staring. I had mistaken two realistically drawn eyeballs for her real eyes. They looked so real, I nearly missed the thick black threads that crisscrossed between her eye lids, sewing them shut.\n\nThe light had stopped flashing, and was now been shining brightly on the freak below. Her mouth opened into a wide 'O' and she began to stir.\n\nThen the light flashed off and remained that way. I couldn’t see her anymore. My heart pounded in my chest, painfully, making it hard to breathe. \n\nI'm not sure how long I stayed, frozen in terror, before I realized the last thing the woman did before the lights cut out was begin to stand. \n\nI've never run faster in my life. I practically leapt across the street, boots pounding against cement as I flew. It was hard to see and my feet felt heavy.\n\nA block later I heard the singing. It wasn't any Disney princess shit. If you've ever heard clips of 'throat singing' that’s about as close as I can describe it, but lacking any of its humanity. The wicked noise followed me to my dorm.\n\nWhen I shut the door to my room, there was silence. Still extremely high and on the verge of mania, I stripped my sweat soaked clothes off, and ran the shower as hot as my body could handle. I curled onto the floor and let the water wash over me.  \n \n\nI woke up the next morning to banging on the door and someone asking me how much longer I was going to take. The shower was still running and my skin had mild burns from the hot water which had now turned cold.   \n \n\nWorking with four hours of sleep, I spent the whole day in bed, and the next day too. At the time I was convinced I had schizophrenia. I was smoking way too much weed and I remember reading that it increases your risk for developing schizophrenia. During the those 48 hours I kept doubting my own mind, even asking my roommates, 'You hear that?\", every time a noise came from outside our room. I'm pretty sure I freaked them out.\n\nThe weekend luckily arrived and my mind had managed to somewhat bury the memories from that night. I made sure to drink myself stupid, and my friends carried me home Friday and Saturday night. \n\nOne thing to note is that apparently, while I was being dragged home while blacked out from the bar one night, we had seen a homeless lady on the side of the street. When we passed by she shook her cup of change and I reacted so violently, screaming and trying to wrestle out of the grip of my buddies, that passerby's around us were going to call the cops. The poor little lady was trembling, trying to pick up the spilt change around her as I was hauled away. I don’t remember this happening.\n\nI started to stay the night at my sister's place. Convincing myself it didn't happen took some time, but the anxiety that came when 3 AM rolled around was very real. I'd stay huddled on my sister's bed while she slept, not even leaving to go to the bathroom until the hour passed. \n\nSpending the night there actually helped my sleep schedule. My sister was fine with me sleeping over, but she had shit to do so staying in bed until mid-afternoon wasn't an option. I started going to classes again and hanging out with my friends more and spent less time at my sister's.\n\nA week into this and I had gone out to lunch with some of my friends. After our meal, they wanted to stop by the Walgreens for some snacks and candy. I stayed outside to wait for them, and noticed Pat sitting on the railing that circled a patch of bushes.\n\nWithout much thought I grabbed my wallet and fished out a dollar. She was watching cars pass by and humming to herself. When I got close, Pat stiffened like a bolt of lightning shot through her. She jumped to her feet, spun around and locked her beady eyes with mine. \n\nPat's tiny face was stained with terror. \n\nIt was frightening to see and stopped me in my tracks. My arm was outstretched offering a dollar, but Pat treated it like it was radioactive material.\n\n\"Hey, Pat,\" I managed. I thought I had surprised her, so I paused expecting her to recognize me since I've talked to her before. \"Er, I got you a dollar.\"\n\nPat took a step back. \n\n\"*why*?\" She croaked.\n\nThe question confused me. \"Well- \"\n\n\"*why me*?\"\n\nEven in broad daylight, I couldn’t see her step off the curb. I never saw the car, accelerating off a left hand turn, the driver focused on trying to beat the oncoming traffic. \n\nOne of my friends who was walking out of the store when it happened said she was so light the car knocked her a good 15 feet into the air. \"I can't believe how high she flew, man,\" he kept repeating afterward. \"She really went flying, man, she was so small.\" \n\nPat's head had hit the curb with enough force to split it open, smearing its contents across the street. In the pictures you can see bits of hair and brain matter at the end of the block, carried by the river of blood that flowed along the side of the street.\n\nEven though I was the closest to it, I only saw the gruesome scene from the photos and video that spread through the student population like wildfire.\n\nWhen Pat had spoken her last words, the throat singing begun to sound again. It filled my ears, and Pat heard it too. She wasn't looking at me when we spoke. She was looking behind me. \n\nI blacked out to the sound of the ungodly music and brakes screeching.\n\nI woke up in an ambulance, which is every college kid's worst nightmare and begged the paramedics to let me out when I figured out where I was. They didn't listen and took me to the hospital. My parents paid for the bill and the therapy after finding out what happened. They were calling me nonstop in the months following, constantly checking up, asking if my therapist was listening to me. I gave them a rehearsed answer every time.\n\nSome time passed before I could bring myself to watch the video of the aftermath that my roommate had received in a fraternity group chat. A student had begun to record right after the vehicle struck Pat.\n\nThe video starts with the camera pointed down at the recorder's feet. Screaming and shouting can be heard as the camera shifts from faded checkered Vans up towards the street.\n\nThe director is some distance down the block and the entire scene is on display. A skinny 20-something-year-old slams the door to his undamaged vehicle and staggers towards the motionless, disfigured form on the ground. Some jackass, most-likely an arrogant pre-med prick, kneels over Pat's body feeling uselessly for an extinct pulse. Within the first ten seconds of the video, the amount of liquid that had leaked from Pat onto the street was shocking.\n\nGlimpses of my slumped figure can be seen on the sidewalk as people scatter, both further and closer to the accident. Nobody is really around me except for my friends who don't seem to notice me. I can't blame them.\n\nThere was one oddity I found in the video. If you looked to the right edge of the screen, where the opposite sidewalk is, there is a homeless man sitting along the wall of a store. Out of everyone on screen he seems the most unfazed. Throughout the entire video he is motionless and has his hands clasped together in what looks like some form of prayer. If you look further along the road you can see another homeless lady doing the exact same thing. Both had their eyes fixed directly on Pat laying in the road and seem to mutter something under their breath, their lips moving ever so slightly.\n\nThe university gave extra time on assignments to all students for the next two weeks. I was given some special accommodations by the university and it was much appreciated.\n\nI couldn't focus on school, chores, or taking care of myself. I would lose track of conversations and movies or shows that I watched. It took some time to notice that my roommates and friends had started to avoid me. Less invitations to go out, ending conversations with me as soon as possible, avoiding me whenever I was in the room by always coincidentally having homework they needed to finish in the study room. \n\nI started going to my sister's apartment all the time again. I would spend days back to back there; waking, smoking, eating, shitting, smoking, and sleeping. That was it. \n\nThe rest of the semester passed in a blur. About two weeks before the last of finals wrapped up, the incident that forced me to take a gap year and finish my college career living off campus occurred. \n\nMy sister's boyfriend came up for the weekend. Obviously, I couldn't stay with them so I was forced to go back to my dorm. At this point my roommates and I weren't even on speaking terms. They sort of nodded a greeting at me whenever we saw each other before burying their heads back into their phones or laptops.\n\nI had convinced my sister to let me take a few nugs of bud back to my dorm. My roommates were asleep and I was scrolling through my phone when I decided it was a good time for a smoke. We were on the third floor and there was going to be a fight in the morning if I hotboxed the room, so I went to my window and started cranking the lever to open it wide. \n\nI went about finding my bowl and grinding the weed up on my desk. I heard some scraping outside but I assumed it was a tree, brushing up against the building from the wind. When my bowl was packed I checked my phone**. 3:13 AM**. I went back to the window and leaned outside, the glass against my lips and a lighter raised in the other hand. \n\nWhat waited outside plunged me into a state of shock.\n\nAssembled en masse below my window was a crowd of people. They were all disheveled; clothes in various stages of tatters and rips, dirty hair clumped together and sticking out at bizarre angles, unkempt facial hair and sores adorning most of their faces. Huddled together they stood, hands interlocked, faces downcast and a low droning chant rose from them.\n\nNow sweating profusely, the bowl slipped from my grasp. Time slowed as it fell and, after what felt like an hour, I watched it explode with a sharp pop on the ground below, directly before the throng of vagrants. The droning ceased as suddenly as flicking a switch. My bladder loosened and I felt a vague wetness spreading down my leg and soaking into my pants. \n\nAs one entity, the faces of 30 rose to meet mine. All of their eyes were closed. All of them with realistic eyes drawn on their eyelids.   \n \n\nTo my horror, now seeing all their faces, I could recognize some. They were all homeless. Jeffrey from the bars, Lewis from the alley by McDonalds, Lavell from the corner of Main Street.\n\nPat was there too. A dreamy smile plastered across one half of her still mangled face. The left side of her head drooped down so low it rested on her shoulder. Somehow I knew that her painted eyes had found me as everyone else's had.\n\nI don't remember when I started to hear the throat singing. I was lost in the gaze of dozens. The rumbling began, a vile vibration I felt throughout my whole body. \n\nIt was coming from below. When I looked straight down, I'm sure I lost a vital piece of my sanity. \n\nEyes sewn shut stared up at me. The freak that was under the streetlamp that night was now scaling the dorm wall. The things mouth was open, the throat singing now at an animal-like climax. It raised its right arm, and it's nails scraped across the brick as its hand reached out and pulled itself closer to me and my window. \n\nThe horde began to sway, dancing perversely, spinning and bending at crooked angles.\n\n*Scrrape*\n\nThe thing was close enough to see that its eyes were straining against the twine sewn deeply in its skin folds. It was trying to open its eyes. It was trying to look at me. I wish I had left before its left eye ripped free of the strings holding it closed. \n\nI stared into the hole in its head, empty enough to hold an ocean, vast enough to house the cosmos. There was nothing, and yet everything within that vacant socket. When I saw movement shudder from inside, I felt my mind slip into madness. I was and still am terrified of what would've happened if it opened its other eye. \n\nMy roommates woke to delirious and incoherent gibberish and me pointing towards the window, before I sprinted out of the room and locked myself in the public bathroom. They called my parents when they looked and discovered nothing.\n\nAfter this I did a brief stint in a mental hospital, 7 days in total. Everyone I tell my story to gives me the same look I used to give to others who weren't mentally there: A mask of pity hiding the thoughts of, *\"Wow, this guy's off his fucking rocker*\"*.* They let me out a couple days after I learned that no one would believe me and the process would become a lot smoother if I just shut up. I was sent back to my parent's house and spent the next year under the careful watch of my mom and dad.\n\nA few months later I tried to tell my dad the truth but he started to give me that look. I noticed when he tried to discreetly slip to the bathroom in the middle of my story. He pulled his phone out of his pocket while he shut the door. When he walked back out I was laughing, telling him I couldn't believe he fell for it. The relief on his face was obvious and he laughed with me, sat back onto the couch and gave me a hug.\n\n\"I'm so glad you're better.\"\n\nIt took a year to fully convince everyone I had a mental break from stress and anxiety and that I could function again in society. My parents had exhausted a lot of money on me and I couldn't apply to another college. The state university sympathized with my situation and offered for me to come back as long as I followed certain guidelines. Living off campus wasn't one of them but I insisted. \n\nIt's my final year now and I'm looking forward to a relaxing and uneventful future. I know this isn't a possibility but my therapist says my future is in my hands and nothing is certain. What is certain is that I dream every night.\n\nSometimes its Pat, her head still a mess of flesh and brain, with the same trance-like smile, before a car eviscerates her from my thoughts. Other times I'm looking deep into the empty socket of the thing. Infinite and hollow, but housing something that lurks in the fringes of my mind's eye. The common denominator of all these dreams is the incessant croaking of the throat singing. It never stops, even following me back into the waking world sometimes. I'll awaken, trying to breathe but unable to gasp for air. The guttural noise sounds like its coming from everywhere, all around and even inside of me. \n\nTherapy doesn't help. Neither do psychedelics. The hellscape I was sent to off shrooms was worse than reality. I pray but no one answers. I'm sure my death won't be natural. It will either be by my hands or theirs. I just wish for it to end soon",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10vln95/an_app_used_by_billionaires/",
        "text": "A guy once told me that he had bad luck. I told him it was an app used by billionaires that was causing him all sorts of trouble. I shouldn't have done that. The people behind that app tortured me for years. Even now. Where I'm a little safer. Feel a bit less afraid? I believe it to be a ploy created by the handlers in order to give me a taste of what I used to have. Just so they can come back and take it all away, to remind me of what it means to lose something. In case I forgot what that felt like, since they took everything.\n\nAll because I wouldn't mind my own business.\n\nBut I think that even if I kept my nose out of places. I would have found them anyway. Because according to my mother, I have a penchant for being in the wrong places at the right time. See. When I was 16 or so. I realized that school wasn't for me. But I had been taught that money is freedom and who doesn't want to be free. So I figured a way to make money by uncovering when someone was getting cheated. And it all started when I found my neighbor having an affair with the girl next door.\n\nAll I was doing was watering the plants like my mom told me to. It was part of my chores. When they stumbled into my yard. They were in several states of undress and I have no idea what they were thinking. Like next to the gnomes? Well, my neighbor bribed me of course. I didn't know it was a bribe then. He didn't even know that I didn't know that he even had a wife. If he had known, he'd have saved himself a used piano.\n\nAnd after that happened, everything clicked. I realized that I could finally answer the question in Mrs. Peterson's 2nd grade class during Future Me Day. The question was something like: What does the world need? Which triggered the idea in my then teenage brain to figuring out what the world would always have, what would be the thing that I could monetize.\n\nWhat the world would always have is a sucker calling itself a lollipop.\n\nIt usually goes like this. I find a big company. Join its ranks. Rise up. Learn what laws are being broken. And then sell the security risks back to the company. Some would call it blackmail. I guess it was. Listen. I don't condone it. I'm just telling how it was when it was. Collect the money and be on my merry way. Always be moving. It's one of my old life rules that transferred over to my new life. Always be moving. Once a company tried to pay me off by promoting me to the CFO. But all that would do was pin me to the crime. It didn't matter what the annual payday looked like if I couldn't spend it in prison.\n\nI pulled other gigs too. You wouldn't believe the espionage behind some of entertainments biggest moments. Like who to snub, or how agreements can include an official favoring during games. Or if things go to the score cards, how it will lean for a bout.\n\nAnd those are but candle licks.\n\nI've seen some bad stuff. Some bad stuff. Stuff that I told myself, if I ever saw. I'd back out. And I did. Several times in fact. Even brought down a hum ding ring once. It got messy and I didn't get paid. But it was worth it.\n\nAs a part of my deal to help prosecute that hum ding ring, was to let me go through a number of phones that were confiscated, in order to gain leverage for a different objective. And that's what I thought it was going to be. Leverage. But instead I stumbled to an invite only app. Stuff that is off the grid, and can only be transferred from a handler to another's.\n\nIt was within a high profile phone that I was looking through, when I found the app.\n\nFrom a typical home screen, the app is unassuming. The logo changes from user to user, and so do the words beneath it. The common color schematics have been muted greys and blues. My version of the app was named Ripple. Upfront it looks like an uninteresting app. It could easily be mistaken as a utility that's bundled with the operating system.\n\nThat is until it loads. And again. Even getting to the menu, which is often designed to mimic a filter app or some kind of health tracker. And if they did their due diligence, then all the buttons would work. Which is what generally stops most people from digging further. But it's like walking into a paper skyscraper. Something is off, even if it does look solid. And within a few clicks, experience tells me that this is a DD.\n\nThey're rare in the wild. Serving essentially as a front gate for apps. It was once widely used by 8-bit video game developers who needed to jump through different stages of a game from the menu screen.\n\nMost DDs use a rather rudimentary pin style that utilized nested folders. In short. There are 9 numbered links whose orders are invisible to the end user, and within each of those 9 links, there are 9 more links within each one. And 9 more. And more. Necessitating a numbered code that could only be inputted by resetting at the main menu and entering each link in the correct numerical order from screen to screen until the real app is revealed.\n\nAfter compilers became common in project building, DDs became rather obsolete. Existing as hobby coding or Easter Eggs for fans to find. And they're mostly harmless.\n\nThis DD was hiding an entire ecosystem of dirty money.\n\nI was expecting to find sex requests, but I suppose they have Raya for that. Instead I found contract requests for mundane and seemingly benign tasks that led no where.\n\nBut only on the outside.\n\nInstead these small tasks were meant to control the larger picture. Chipping tinyly away at aspects of human life. For instance one of the first jobs I did to test the water was simply show up at a coffee shop, at a specific time, and order a drink. It netted me $150 dollars and a free drink. No harm done right?\n\nWrong.\n\nWrong, wrong. Wrong.\n\nI was so wrong.\n\nA man died right outside the shop. He was waiting at the back of the line, leaning against the open door. When he was run over by a loose car. There were a dozen witnesses. And still, the driver got away. What made me realize something was truly afoot, was when several people in and around the store checked their phones about the same time mine went off.\n\nI was taking pictures of the crime when the notification popped up. It was for the money deposited in my account for completing the contract.\n\nAnd I might have rummaged through the dead man's wallet and found out his name was Frank and some basic information. Which allowed me to track the man's itinerary several hours before the accident. And everyone that I spoke to along Frank's day, seemed to have the impression he was running late. It wasn't until I questioned a co-worker that it started coming together.\n\nI had snuck into the dead man's office building as an employee. And was striking up conversations randomly. I tried a bunch of different tactics to get people to talk. But it was the coffee gag that got me a piece of the puzzle.\n\nThe pot was empty for the fifth time this hour. I had been dumping it. And was in the middle of a brew coming down when this guy about 6'1, medium built, 40 or 45, is standing nervously behind me.\n\nI clicked my tongue hoping to get enough of his attention, \"They ought to keep four or five of these pots filled here.\" I tapped the side of my watch. \"With what they're paying us. It's the least they could do.\" I let out a sigh. \"Makes me wonder if their mismanagement is what got Frank killed...\" The man behind me suddenly stopped fidgeting. So I continued, \"...heard he was held up yesterday because of that meeting.\"\n\n\"There was a meeting,\" his voice sudden.\n\n\"Yeah. Kept us all in over some budget thing.\"\n\n\"What budget thing? I'm on the budgeting board. I didn't hear about any meeting.\"\n\n\"The budget thing,\" I told him. \"You didn't get the memo?\"\n\n\"I didn't see anything on MS Teams. What meetin-\"\n\n\"Man. You should have been there.\" I clapped a hand on his back. \"They had Frank all riled up. And darn near dragged that thing on. I bet if Frank got out of there on time. He wouldn't have gotten run over. Bad luck, I say.\"\n\n\"Oh God.\"\n\nI still remember that look he gave me. I almost felt bad for lying to him back then.\n\n\"I thought I killed him.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I,\" the man stuttered, \"I thought it was me.\" He shakes his head and slams his phone on the table. \"They didn't give out any bonuses last year-\"\n\n\"Yeah. I know. Those cheap bastards. I was going to fix my car with that money.\"\n\n\"-and my partner. Lost his job. And, and I thought that I'd make a little extra cash. Find a side hustle.\"\n\n\"Mmm.\"\n\n\"So I asked around. If y-you know. Anyone knows anything. And.\" He stared at me. \"It was just some app. Asking me to do a bunch of nothing. And that morning. A contract popped up asking me to give Frank all sorts of papers. Send over calls. Referrals. Stuff like that. Keep him busy any time he looked open. For no reason, all morning. But after I heard what happened. I figured. It must have been me. I took up too much of his morning. And he died. But, it was management. Oh thank God.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that. I thought it was going to be easy sailing. Now that I knew what I was looking for in order to exploit the system. Find a way to utilize that against the handlers. But it was dead ends all the way. There was that time I had to go around in a business suit, talking about mergers quietly on my phone as I moved through some budding building that looked promising. The JACO thing. I still can't believe that one turned up empty witnesses. Nantucket was a bust. And the janitor stint didn't give me any new leads.\n\nI did contracts for months and found nothing. In fact. I was about ready to give up when I told that poor sap about to blow his head off on the roof. That the red flowers I took to the bar weren't actually for his wife. And that I had no clue what was going on. Only that I had been hired to be there at that time and place. With red flowers. Likely for him to see.\n\nThat was the worst offense in my playbook. A play I had told myself to avoid, because of how it has backfired before in the past. Never sell your hand to the weaker party. It is a sure way to invite defeat. See the hum dim ring was sold to a governing body. This was just saving some average guy that probably pissed off some rich prick.\n\nThe handlers came for me.\n\nHard.\n\nI was erasing my tracks behind me in order to go home after talking that guy off the roof. Thinking I was done with the app because I deleted it. My operations were in the millions that year. And I could afford to lose a few hundred hours. Some times these things don't pan out. Cut my losses and move on. I had been psyching myself up to let it go. Nothing a few empty drinks wouldn't solve. When my tire rolled off the rim.\n\nIt was wet. The sun was gone. And the switchback passes up the mountain was filled with trees. Some had recently broken down from the storm. And one was ready to skewer me alive when I lost control. I snapped the guardrail like a pretzel stick. The car left the ground. And for a second the entire world became pitch black. Before it came for me. Hundreds of branches as I plunged into the forest. A tree trunk the size of my chest came cracking through the windshield. It broke the passenger seat in half and tattooed the steel frame.\n\nWhen they found me, my horn was barely a whisper. It had been conveniently broken in a way where it was depleted. And I wouldn't have made it. If I hadn't been resuscitated. When I came to. I asked around. And a nurse caught the EMT who was first on the scene. But when I thanked the EMT for resuscitating me, she said that sure I was banged up. That I had been flung from my vehicle but was already breathing when she arrived.\n\nTo this day I can't decide if someone wasn't meant to kill me, had to save their own skin by rescuing me. Or if they were always supposed to save me. So the handlers could keep torturing me. I prefer the former, but I know the latter to be true.\n\nAnd it went like this for awhile.\n\nWhat looked like bad luck. Was actually an invisible set of strings being pulled by those trying to teach me a lesson. If only I didn't know better.\n\nOvernight they drained my accounts.\n\nI was locked out of about everything. Even my phone. And to this day. My dog is still missing. I found her collar one night on the kitchen counter. Folded in a way only a human could. The door was wide open. And all of the security tapes were wiped clean.\n\nA few days later, forensics dusted some prints off a homicide in another state. They said those prints were mine. And I was to be extradited. Of course I made a run for it. Hid at my sister's for a bit. But it didn't matter where I went. They would come for me. Eventually, I found myself deep in the woods. And I saw a dark figure standing amongst the trees. I thought to myself. That this was finally it. They were going to kill me. But then I heard a phone vibrating. A screen light up. Before it left me alone in the dark.\n\nI wouldn't be stranded for long. Even though I kept moving. For a group of armed and armored enforcers came and took me that same night. Plucked me out of the river, nearly drowning me. And I don't know where they took me.\n\nBut it was unlike any prison. Public or private. That I had ever seen.\n\nThe people captured there called it Mt. Pontenego.\n\nIt was as much torture as it was experimentation. A guy in a white lab coat would come in my cell everyday and eat his lunch in front of me while I was being starved.\n\nI tried fighting against my restraints at first, but as my body grew weaker, I could only cry as the smell of food wafted into my open mouth as I laid on the ground. And it was after one of those times that he had been done beating me. When I asked him, \"What are you planning to do with me.\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Then why are you holding me,\" I yelled at him. Coughing so much it felt as if my lungs were folding in my chest. \"Why are you starving me?\"\n\nHe didn't answer me. But for the next several months. He would be starving me to the point of death. And then feeding me. Starve me. Then FEED ME. STARVE ME. FEED ME. STARVE ME. FEED ME. Edging me closer and closer to the point of death that, \"Even if there is food in your mouth. You will die hungry.\"\n\nThe problem was. He never let me die.\n\nI had lost all track of time, and the day they stopped giving me water regularly.\n\nThe man told me a story.\n\n\"When I was 8 years old. My father deprived me of water. It was because I wet the bed. The first day he only took away my drinking at night. But it was not enough. I would still fail him. The next day he would take it away from me an hour earlier. Still, I would wet the bed. The next day, an hour even earlier. And another. And when the hours shrunk into an hour, and then minutes. Until the night he knew the precise minute I would wet myself after consuming 500 milliliters of water. He finally told me that he was proud of what he accomplished.\"\n\nThe man set an empty glass in front of me and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing without water is a slow and painful. My skin became dry to the touch. Pieces would flake off if I rubbed it. Eventually cracking when I moved. I ate those pieces. My eyeballs would stick. Distorting my vision. Along with it, the perception of time, as everything seemed to judder. The fluid in my brain thinned. It didn't recover even when I was finally given a drink to prolong my suffering. In fact, it has never returned to normal.\n\nI became so dehydrated that eventually I began wondering if I could melt the glass in my mouth. It looked so clear and crispy. If I had been able to reach it. I wasn't. But I know for a fact that if I had been able to reach it, I would have tried to swallow that glass whole. I was that thirsty.\n\nAnd I was kept on that verge for time without, until everything became meaningless.\n\nThen almost like a joke. I was dragged, gagged, and bagged. Waking up in a bowling alley, in some city I've never laid eyes on. Not a handler in sight and the smell of crusty shoes in my nose. And I had never been so happy in my life for it. To be done with the app used by billionaires.\n\nExcept, I ask myself I if I ever really escaped. Because everyday since they let me go. I've been afraid to do anything. Accomplish anything. Because if I secure anything. They'll just come back and take it from me. To remind me of what loss is, if anything. But if I have nothing. Then I can be free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[s](https://www.reddit.com/r/CornerCornea/comments/u6rx8n/subscribe/)",

        "text": "I work as an intern for a Prague-based virtual reality start up. Most of my job revolves around office work that no one else wants to do. Organizing paperwork, follow-up e-mails, copy edits, picking up coffee — that sort of stuff. On occasion, however, I do house calls where I help people set up our VR rig.\n\nThere’s far too many NDA’s preventing me from going into details of how our tech works, but to keep it simple we use a headset and a couple of spread-out motion sensors to provide full body range for player avatars. The process isn’t complicated and we ship with a neat instruction booklet that should clear out any questions. Some of our clientele, however, can’t be bothered with the nuances of the set-up so they pay a bit extra to have me come through and hook things up.\n\nIt's usually rich folks who want to outsource their parenting time to a VR set-up. From the two dozen or so house calls I’ve done this year, more than half of them were in Paris Street and the rest were dotted around Prague’s more obscure wealthy neighborhoods. I’d come in, set up the motion sensors in under five minutes, do a little show-and-tell and then usually settle down to drink some expensive coffee while answering any leftover questions.\n\nI used to like making house-calls. Getting out of the office was nice, the expensive coffee was even nicer and introducing our tech to folks unfamiliar with it provided a great way to break the monotony of my usual days. I used to like making house-calls, but after today, after meeting the man who wanted to see *everything*… I’d really prefer to stick to paperwork.\n\nThe request came in from an unusual neighborhood — Prague 13. Prague 13 borders the utter edges of the thousand year city and might arguably be the least historic part of town with modernity avoiding the district until the late 70s. It’s all old commie blocks and parks out there, so I was surprised to see someone not only buy our expensive VR setup but also pay the surcharge for a private installation. I was further surprised when the address on the order didn’t point me to normal housing. It pointed me to the middle of a nature reserve.\n\nOur set-up isn’t heavy, but it’s not exactly something that’s fun to lug around. Usually, I’d grab an Uber from the office and have it drop me off at the front door of the client. This time around, however, no car could get me to the address. The best my Uber driver could do was to drop me off at a road in the middle of nowhere hugging the edge of a forest.\n\nI’ve spent most of my adult life in Prague and I’m well familiar with the various quirks this city has, but my trek through the forest definitely takes the cake. Google Maps assured me that there was a civilized footpath to get me to the address, but what I was presented with was an uneven patch of land where no grass grew leading through the woods. As unkempt as the path was, however, in between the stones and mud and grass I could spy manhole covers adorned with Prague’s ancient coat of arms. It very much felt like I had left civilization, but beneath my feet there was an ever-present reminder that I was still connected to the waste waters of a metropolis.\n\nI trudged through the forest with all of the equipment until the trees gave way to a clearing. In the center of the clearing there sat a reservoir connected to a cement shack. Beyond that shack sat a wooden cabin which corresponded to the address I was given.\n\nThe trek through the forest had put me well off schedule. I was long overdue for the installation and I was expected back in the office after I was done. Instead of going towards the cabin, however, I put down the equipment and took a breather by the reservoir.\n\nThere was just something about the way the sunlight bounced off of the water that scratched something in my lizard brain. The pond was clearly man made but it was hugged with reeds and filled with ducks and fish. I watched the animals for a bit and lost myself in a strange cosmic tranquility — until a wholly different animal wrestled my attention away.\n\nA bird. A jet-black bird with beady red eyes. It stood completely still, just a stone’s throw away from me. At first I thought it was a plastic toy that I had simply not noticed when I sat down. The thing was motionless and completely black from claws to beak and didn’t look like any bird I had seen before. But then the thing took a step toward me.\n\nI shooed the bird away, but it didn’t fly. It just took a couple steps backwards and continued to watch me with its rat eyes. Whatever semblance of calm I had felt had dissipated. I got up, gathered the equipment and proceeded to walk towards the cabin while avoiding the black bird.\n\nThe thing kept on following me. It didn’t hop or fly. It walked. When I sped up the bird started to run to keep up. As small as the bird was, it kept pace. To distract myself from the discomforting sight I called the customer to tell him I was near.\n\nThe voice that came from the other end of the line was strained and old and void of any emotion. The customer didn’t seem to be concerned about me running late. He, in fact, sounded rather busy. From the other side of the line I could hear a cacophony of explosions and gunfire and moans and a dozen different voices saying a dozen different things. As loud as the other side of the line was, however, the customer seemed to understand me clearly. He said he would come out and meet me in case I had trouble finding his cabin.\n\nA couple seconds after I hung up the phone, the doors of the cabin opened up and the customer made his way into the clearing. He was dressed in filthy rags that must’ve been normal clothes at some point in the previous century. The old man was balding, but his hair and beard looked like they had not seen a razor in decades. The customer was far too old and looked far too disheveled to order our high-tech overpriced VR rig, but what was most discomforting was how he moved.\n\nThe only thing I can really compare it to is AI generated animations. The old man’s limbs moved completely independent of each other in a way that suggested they each served a different puppet master. He looked as if he were about to fall, or sprint, or jump — yet the old man did neither. He simply stumbled in my general direction with a phone in his hand.\n\n‘Are you here to introduce me to the wonders of virtual reality?’ he asked in a queer voice that will haunt me until the day I die.\n\n‘Yes,’ I said, and then started to explain how the set-up was going to work.\n\nThe man was wholly uninterested in anything I had to say. Once I had identified myself as a representative of the VR company all of his attention went back to his phone. I couldn’t see what was happening on the screen, but I delivered my explanation to the backing of pained moans. It wasn’t until a fluttering of wings passed right by my head that the old man acknowledged me again.\n\n‘Ah,’ he said, as the rat eyed bird landed on his shoulder. ‘I see you’ve met my friend.’ The old man’s eyes were bloodshot and his pupils were the size of ticks. Looking at him made me beyond uncomfortable, but what he did next made my stomach feel uneasy.\n\n‘He likes to watch,’ the old man said and then, with nauseating speed, his eyes turned sharply in the direction of the bird without his head moving an inch. Were he a healthy man, I would say I could see the whites of his eyes, but a healthy man he was not. All I could see was bloody pink flesh ravaged by some unspeakable disease.\n\n‘He has come here to watch the final century,’ the old man said, looking like something out of a medical textbook. ‘But enough about that. Come into my humble home and introduce me to the wonderful world of virtual reality.’\n\nAs we walked towards the cabin the man’s attention went back to his phone. The sound of a roaring chainsaw amplified the pained moans from the screen and finally drowned them out. I managed to sneak a peek at what he was watching.\n\nIt was one of those cartel beheading videos that fourteen-year-olds could stumble upon back in the LiveLeak days.\n\nSeeing that the man was casually watching execution videos sent a chill down my spine, but by the time we reached the cottage I found other things to worry about. Before we even reached the front door I could hear the chaos. The same barrage of sounds that I heard on the other side of the phone was now on the other side of a worn wooden door.\n\nOne look at the man’s home made me think I was going to meet my end. The cabin was humble in stature but every inch of it was covered in screens — monitors, televisions, loose tablets drawing power from a sea of filthy extension cords on the floor. From Netflix shows to war footage to pornography to Simpsons re-runs the shambling home was filled with a hundred different forms of media battling for attention.\n\n‘I like to watch,’ the old man with the black bird on his shoulder said with something approaching pride. ‘I have come here to watch and I will watch and I hope that by the end of it all I would have seen *everything*.’\n\nBefore the shock from the menagerie of screens even set in — the stench hit me. All the windows were covered in screens. Among the extension cords, in the little room that was left, grimy rags peeked from the floor like fledgling grass.\n\nAll while trying not to breathe too much, I told the old man there wasn’t enough space for the VR set up in his house. He looked at me with his sickly eyes bulging from his skull and then he laughed. It was an unnatural sound that seemed to come from deep in his gut and for the whole duration of his *laugh* the man didn’t break eye contact with me.\n\n‘No,’ he finally wheezed. ‘This is the room in which I watch. I have a separate room in which I will experience this new reality.’ Like a ballerina in the midst of electroshock therapy the old man hopped his way between the wiring. At the far end of the room, nestled between two plasma televisions playing Rick and Morty reruns and snuff films, there sat a doorway. As I tiptoed through the grime and extension cords I regretted wearing my white sneakers.\n\nThe stench of filth was never truly gone, but getting past the doorway brought the smell of ancient paper mixed with a bit of fresh air. The old man had led me into a roomy woodshed packed with old newspapers. The shed was the perfect size for the VR set up but much like the main hall of the cabin it proved to be a bad choice. The walls of the shed didn’t connect to the roof. It wouldn’t take much of a storm to get the motion sensors wet and in need of repair.\n\nWhen I told the old man that there was a really high chance of the VR set up getting damaged he, once again, laughed. When those terrible choking sounds finished, he said that money was not an issue. He lived a *humble* life. If the VR set up got damaged he could just have me called over to replace it.\n\nThe thought of revisiting the old man made me want to quit on the spot, so I didn’t say anything else. I just set up the equipment as fast as possible and considered myself lucky the old man wasn’t interested in small talk.\n\nUsually people will ask questions about the tech, or at least watch me as I put up the sensors. The old man, however, had turned around in the doorway and was watching the chaotic mix of channels on the other side. As the chaos next door roared in its chorus of gunfire and moans and canned laughter he seemed to grunt to himself in satisfaction.\n\nOnly the bird with its beady red eyes seemed to be interested in what I was doing. Its stare made me work much faster than I ever did.\n\nWhen the set up was finally finished and the headset was booted up it took me three attempts to get the man’s attention, but when I finally had it, it was undivided.\n\n‘I cannot wait to experience this virtual reality! Oh the things I will *see* there!’ he screamed, as if he were threatening to fight someone.\n\nThe moment he had the headset on he seemed to be completely oblivious to my presence in the room. He started to holler and shout and jump around, screaming about how *marvelous this new reality is*.\n\nAs he spun through the demo reel I had loaded him into, the black bird jumped off his shoulder. It might’ve been simply dodging the old man’s jittery leaps but the moment the bird took a step towards me I fled the room.\n\nWhat was in that cabin was well above my paygrade and I wasn’t going to take any chances.\n\nI ran past the reservoir, through the forest and back to where my Uber driver had dropped me off. I ordered another Uber during my mad sprint from that terrible place, yet when I arrived the driver seemed to be parked at some gas station. When he didn’t show up for a solid three minutes I gathered my breath and ran even further, past a park, past the housing projects and into a subway.\n\nI rode that subway to the other side of town, wishing with all my might that any memory of that old man or his bird or that terrible cabin would be washed out of my mind forever.\n\nBut they weren’t.\n\nI do my best not to think about that strange afternoon on the outskirts of Prague and, for the most part, I succeed. Usually, I can go days without ever wondering about the old man or his red-eyed bird. Whenever it rains though, whenever there is even a single dark cloud in the sky — I can’t help but worry.\n\nI can’t help but worry that the old man will require my services once [more](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/).",

        "text": "\nMy grandfather's a tough old man. Probably the toughest person I've ever met, even now; especially now. \nHe was a farmer all his life, working the fields alone, turning down offers of help from family, and the local teenagers that came looking for a job. \nWe all believed he was just too proud to accept help. Too set in his ways to trust his livelihood to someone else. And for a while I think that was true. \nEventually though, in his late 60's he had little choice but to bring someone else on following a farming accident that cost him his left arm, and almost his life. \nHe continued to work the farm however, and still does to this day, well into his 90's. He's the youngest 92 year old I've ever known. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast fall my wife Mila and I spent the week at my parent's, helping them out with some minor renovations.\nIt was during our last day of our visit that I decided to take Mila to visit my grandparents. She'd only met them once before at our wedding, and I didn't want to leave Oregon without seeing them. \nSo that morning we said goodbye to my folks, and drove the forty minutes to my grandparents farm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop and Gram were delighted to see Mila and I. They insisted we stay for dinner, which meant we would likely miss our flight home, but we couldn't say no, seeing as how little I got to see them. \n\n\n\n\n\nMila helped Gram out in the kitchen, listening to embarrassing stories of my youth, while I helped Pop out with the cows. It was just like old times, just him and I, cleaning up after the cows, while listening to his stories.\nIt was mid October, and prime time for corn harvesting. I offered to help out in the fields, but he turned me down flat. Said his hired guy would be doing it. Instead we settled on the back porch, each sipping on a frosty bottle of MOAB, the rich scent of my grandma's roast mixing with the crisp autumn air. \n\n\n\n\n\nPop leaned back in his old rocker, the stump of his left arm resting on his chest. He'd never gotten a prosthetic. Refused to even try it on. \nI was eight when he'd had his accident, and I can still remember the day well. I'd been visiting for the weekend, and had been helping my gram with the inside chores as I had come down with a slight cold that week and she didn't want me helping pop with the corn until I felt better. I remember being upset. I loved riding the picker with pop.  \nBut gram was good at making even the most boring chores fun, and I had nearly forgotten about the corn as grandma let me lick the bowl free of cookie dough. I was holding up the glass bowl when I saw it. A blur of color passing in front of the kitchen window. I'd put the bowl down and hopped off the counter to get a better look. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI nearly screamed when I saw it. I think I may actually have screamed, because in a moment my gram was at my side, screaming too. \nShe ran outside, but I was glued to the floor. I couldn't comprehend what I was seeing. \nPop was on his knees, his jean jacket slick with blood. His normally sun kissed face was completely pale, except for the ring of crusted blood around his mouth. He was holding his left arm, or what remained of it. Bits of torn flesh hung between his fingers as blood spurted out with every beat of his heart.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of the day is a blur to me, but I remember my mother holding me at the hospital, and listening as pop told us what happened. \n\n\n\n\n\nHe'd been in the field, harvesting corn, when a horse charged through the woods that separated their farm from their neighboring farm a few miles away. The horse ran straight to pop, and so he shut off the picker and hopped down to grab the horse. \nBut just as he was getting the horse to calm down so that he could take hold of her, the horse reared back on her hind legs, knocking my pop back into the picker. Before he could get to his feet, the horse somehow managed to knock into the picker, turning it on. \nMy pop's hand was sucked right up into the rollers and taking more with it every second. He didn't have a phone, and no one around to hear him scream, so he did the only thing he could. He reached in his back pocket for his pocket knife, and got to cutting. \n\n\n\n\n\nPop never talked about it again after that day, no matter how many times he was asked. \n\n\n\n\n\nBut sitting on the porch with him that October afternoon something compelled me to ask to hear the story again. \n\n\n\n\n\"Why would you want to hear something like that?\" He mumbled, side eyeing me. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because, it's pretty heroic.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Heroic my ass.\" He grunted, shaking his head. \n\n\n\n\n\"Mila would love to hear it. I've told her, of course, but no one tells a story better than you.\" I said with a wink. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe looked away from me then, and for a moment he looked just like he did the day I saw him through the kitchen window covered in his own blood. He had a look of terror in his eyes. One I'd never seen before or since. I reached out and put my hand on his shoulder, giving it a light squeeze.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You ok Pop?\" I asked, ready to hop up and get my gram. He nodded his head and took a sip of his MOAB with a shaky hand. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'm okay.\" He said, setting his bottle between his legs, and running his fingers over the stump of his left arm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"You sure? You look kind of pale.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I said I was.\" He said firmly, but not in any way unkind. Pop never was one to be fussed over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI sat back in my seat, quietly sipping from my own bottle. \nWe sat in silence for a while, and just as the sky started to turn a reddish orange, he cleared his throat. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You were here that day, you remember that?\" He asked, still staring off into the fields that stretched before us. \n\n\n\n\n\nI knew immediately what he was referring to, and told him that I did remember. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"You were small, not much more than six or seven. I'm surprised you remember at all. But I guess it must be hard to forget something like that.\" He said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was definitely scary seeing you covered in blood. I was just glad you were okay. Could have been so much worse.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe grunted, and wiped his brow, that I could see was starting to bead with sweat despite the chill. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It certainly could have been a lot worse, you ain't kidding. Sometimes I still feel it, you know.\" He said turning to look at me. \"My arm. It feels like it's still there sometimes. Sometimes I even go to scratch it, but my hands feel this nub and it all comes rushing back to me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It must have been terrifying. I can't imagine having to cut off my own arm.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was terrifying, but not because I had to cut my arm off.\" He said. \"There's something I never told you about that day. I never told anyone, matter of fact. And I never planned on it.\" He looked back at me, his gray eyes burning with determination. \"But if you want to know, really want to know, I'll tell you. But you'll promise me you won't repeat it to your mother or grandma. I don't want them thinking I've lost my damn mind.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I didn't say anything he took hold of my arm and squeezed. \"Well? Do you want to know?\" He asked. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I do.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\n\"And do you promise not to tell your mother or grandma?\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I promise pop.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe let out a long breath as if he'd been holding it in, and gave a quick look over his shoulder at the kitchen window. Inside Mila and gram's faint laughter could be heard. He relaxed back into his rocker, taking a small sip from his bottle before starting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You know some of it already. What I told the family at the hospital, that was partly true. A horse knocked me down, and my arm got wedged in the rollers. I had to cut it off with this Winchester.\" He said, pulling out an ancient looking pen knife, and running his thumb over it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"My father gave this to me when I was 14, and I've kept it with me ever since. There's been plenty of times I've left the house without my keys, or my wallet, but never once forgot this knife.\" He wrapped his fist around the rusted handle, and wiped his brow with the sleeve of his blue flannel shirt. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\"I'd taken the picker out to the west field that day. We'd just bought the land over there earlier in the year and this was the first time I'd ever harvested that section. The moment I got there I felt a change in the air, as if it was heavier there somehow. I could feel it with every breath I took, like what breathing in water must feel like. I shoulda come straight back right then. But I didn't. I guess I thought it was just in my damn head.\" He was gazing off in the distance towards the west field, the tips of swaying corn just barely visible from our place on the porch. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Anyway, I got to work, and even though that feeling was still there, I did my best to ignore it. I was halfway through when I heard something. You know how loud that damn picker is, but I could still hear it even over the roar of the picker. I shut it off and hopped out and the sound nearly knocked me off my feet. It's crazy, but it sounded like a freight train was coming towards me. I swear it even felt like the ground was vibrating under my feet. I didn't have time to think about what it could be, because within seconds I saw what it was. But it sure as hell wasn't what I expected. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"A horse came galloping right outta the woods that runs along the edge of the corn, and it looked like it'd been running for days. It took one look at me with wild eyes and ran straight at me. As if I'd been his target all along. She galloped straight at me, weaving and winding her way through the corn. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I could tell right away that she was terrified. I put my arms up and tried to calm her down as she barreled right at me, and after a minute there she was starting to settle. She was exhausted, that much I could tell right away and she looked a little hurt too. I could see some scrapes on her hind, and one gash on her nose. I thought maybe she'd run through a fence over on Bill's farm. I decided I'd take her over to him, get her fixed up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I grabbed her by the bridle, and started to lead her back towards the woods over by Bill's. It was a ways, but I didn't want to leave her unattended for too long.\" He took a gulp from his bottle, and wiped his face.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\"You don't have to keep going pop..\" I said, starting to feel concerned. \"We can go inside if you want.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No, I want to finish. I got to tell someone, Nate. I've kept it in too damn long and the weight of it is suffocating me.\" He said. Before I could respond he continued with his story. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"I tried pulling that horse towards the woods, but she dug into the ground and refused to budge. It was slow going but I managed to get her to take a couple steps\nwhen I heard that sound again. Like something awfully big was coming straight at us. I was looking towards the woods where the sound was coming from, and I thought I could see something moving around in there. I couldn't see it clearly, but I could see something. Something white, moving between the trees. And it was moving fast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Just as….whatever the hell that thing was started to emerge through the treeline, the horse reared back on her hind legs knocking me over into the picker. I was stunned for a second, then started to pull myself up, but then I laid my eyes on what that horse saw; what she'd been running from.\" He looked back up, his eyes large and scared, staring off into that far off field. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"What was it pop?\" I asked, my voice nothing more than a whisper. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know. It sure as hell wasn't another horse, I know that. It wasn't any kind of animal I'd ever seen in my life. It looked more like a man than an animal, though I'm not sure why cause it didn't look like any man I'd ever seen either. It was shaped like one, being it had two legs, and two arms. But its skin was a white scaly gray, and it had these hooked claws on the ends of its fingers that it would dig into the earth to pull itself along. It was crawling for some reason. Sort of dragging itself forward.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Jesus Christ.\" I whispered. Normally Pop would have snapped at me for using the Lord's name in vain, but he didn't seem to notice or care in that moment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"That thing….. was grinning at me, Nate. Grinning with its head bobbing from side to side and giggling like a little kid. The vision of that thing crawling through the dirt towards me…. Has haunted my nightmares for years.\" He said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the hell was it?\" I asked. \n\n\n\n\n\nPop shrugged, and took a drink. \"I don't know. But it was coming right at me. It wasn't moving too fast at that point, not like it was in the woods. I don't know if it was tired or what, but I wasn't planning on asking it. I tried to get to my feet, but that damn horse must have seen that thing coming and she went berserk. She slammed into the picker and somehow  turned it on, then she took off through the field. Those rollers swallowed my hand before I even had a chance to blink. I felt it before I saw it. The bones crushing on my fingers. Still, I wasn't thinking about the pain. I suppose it was the adrenaline, but all I could think about was that thing getting closer. \n\n\n\n\n\"It was already moving across the field at that point, and I was stuck. I tried pulling, but those rollers were sucking my hand in by the second, and before I knew it my wrist was sucked up inside too. I couldn't turn it off, and no matter how loud I screamed no one would hear me out there anyway.  \nI figured I was gonna die right there. Either from the picker or that thing. It was moving at a steady pace, almost like it was enjoying it. And it was too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How do you know?\" I asked. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because it was grinning, Nate. Its eyes were wide and locked on me and it was smiling this great big grin that showed off every one of them teeth. And those teeth were sharp. Even I could see that from across the field. The closer it got the more I could see, and I thought I'd lose my mind if I had to stare at that thing any longer. \nThose milky white eyes and that smile, I'd never seen something so evil, and I pray I never will again.\" \n\n\n\n\n\"What did you do?\" I asked. \n\n\n\n \n\"Thankfully I remembered my father's knife, and pulled it out. At first I held it for protection, in case that thing got close enough. But by the time the rollers had eaten up part of my arm, damn near to the elbow, I knew I could either start cutting, or wait around til that thing got to me, and by then who knows how much of me the picker would have eaten.\n\n\n\n\n\"I decided I wasn't waiting around to find out. So I started cutting as fast as I could. I didn't even feel it. I was too scared of that thing getting to me. \nIt saw me cutting at my arm and I swear I could see the panic in its eyes for just a second. It knew I might get away and it didn't like that. It started moving faster then. Taking big strides with its long arms, sending dirt flying in the air. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Its eyes were even wider, its smile bigger somehow too. So big I think I heard its skin tear and I could hear it making this sound as it scrambled towards me. Loud enough to hear with that picker going. Like a grunting sound. Raspy and deep. I was so scared I started using my own teeth. By the time that thing reached the start of my corn, I was almost free. I was still attached to the picker, but only by the bone. For a moment I was worried I wouldn't be able to break it, not in the position I was in. But luckily for me I didn't have to. The picker took care of that pretty quickly, and I fell back on my ass. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"I scooted away from that thing, my blood spurting out every which way. I still had my father's knife, and I held it out in front of me, though I don't know if it would have done much good.\nIt was pretty close at that point, right next to the picker. \nI kept scooting back, holding that knife out waiting for it to lunge. But it didn't. It stopped crawling, and sat back on its legs, watching me with those eyes that were full of malice. Like it was studying me, seeing if I was any sort of threat. After a minute or two it growled, and turned its attention to the picker. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"It crawled up to it and sniffed at the rollers a bit. Then it reached down in those rollers and yanked my arm out of it. I don't know how it was able to get it without getting itself pulled in, but it did. It took what was left of my arm in its mouth, and started crawling backwards into them woods, watching me the entire way. \nIt stopped at the treeline and even from the distance I could see it smiling at me. It disappeared in the trees but I didn't move until I was sure it wasn't coming back. By then I'd lost a lot of blood, was close to losing consciousness. I pretty much crawled all the way home. Blacked out a few times, but every time I thought I wouldn't get back up, I'd see that damned smile and somehow I'd get the strength to get to my knees again.\" He closed his eyes tight, shaking his head as if to clear the memory from his mind. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"And?\" I said, completely immersed in his story. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe sighed, and tucked his knife in his back pocket. \"And you know the rest. I made it home somehow. God must have given me the strength.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But…  what happened to that… thing in the woods?\" I asked, my own eyes scanning the trees that seemed so much closer than they had before Pop's story. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"That I can't tell you. And you know, I don't think I want to know. Some things aren't meant to be found, Nate. And that thing was one of 'em.\" He said, draining his beer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Did you ever see it again?\" I asked. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop shook his head. \"Nope, and I hope I never will. I stopped working the west field after that. Never stepped foot on it again after that day. Hired Hank Reidy to do it for me. I didn't want to. I didn't want to do anything with that land, but your grandma didn't understand why I wanted to let the land go to shit. Not after spending so much to buy it. I couldn't tell her the truth. She'd think I'd gone crazy. So I hired Hank, and he harvests the corn for me.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI looked at the corn in the west field, swaying in the breeze, and I couldn't help but imagine some horrible gangly creature with a gaping smile, waiting out there in the stalks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop clapped his hand on my shoulder, pulling my gaze away from the west field. \"Your grandma thought I stopped using the picker because I was scared. As if I was afraid I'd lose the other arm. \nAnd she was partly right. I was afraid. But not of that damn picker. I was afraid of that field, Nate.  Still am. Afraid of those woods that bordered it, and the places in the corn where things can hide. Afraid that whatever the hell that thing was that took my arm would come back for the rest of me.\" He stood and smiled down at me with an almost relieved look on his face. \"Come on, smells like dinner's about ready.\" \n\n*\n\n\nI never for a second doubted my Pop's story. Not just because I trust his word, but because when he told me, he was scared. And nothing scares Pop. \nI don't know what he saw out in the woods that day, but whatever it was it scared him enough to cut and bite through his own arm just to get away from it. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat visit was the last time I saw my grandfather. He passed away three weeks ago. Heart attack, doctor said.\nI went out to help my gram pack some of his things away, and when I'd finished I contemplated heading on over to the west field, just to stare into those woods for myself.  But then I remembered the look of terror on my pop's face that day he lost his arm, and the day he told me how he'd lost it and I changed my mind.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop was right. Some things just shouldn't be found. ",

        "text": "“So, this is Tristan’s work?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Hmm.” I wandered around the deck. “Well, at least his skill wasn’t exaggerated.”\n\n“Nothing about him is exaggerated.”\n\nI sighed and turned to him. “Grandpa, he's a con man. I warned you about him and his lies, but you refused to listen.”\n\n\"They're not lies, Starfish.”\n\n“How do you know? All you have is his word.”\n\n“That’s more than enough. He said none of his previous clients have complained.”\n\n“Have you talked to them?”\n\n“No, he doesn’t give out that information.”\n\n“I wonder why,” I said, rolling my eyes.\n\n“Don’t be so cynical, Starfish. He’s protecting their privacy. And I’m glad, because he’ll protect mine too. I don’t want …” He paused and looked down, fidgeting with the loose bandage around his hand. “I don’t want anyone to know how much I paid for this boat. I’ve only told you because we share our love for the open sea.”\n\nMy disapproval mellowed and I walked over to him. “Grandpa, you trusting me means a lot to me. *You* mean a lot to me.” I took his injured hand and adjusted the bandage, cinching it snugly. “That’s why I don’t want to see you get hurt.”\n\n“Don't worry, I won’t. Tonight, I’m taking *Soul’s Oasis* on her maiden voyage, and I’m going to get more than my money’s worth.”\n\nI met his eyes. “*Soul’s Oasis*? That’s quite a name.”\n\n“And she’ll live up to it, Tristan assured me she will.” He walked to the railing and gripped it tight. “I can *feel* it.”\n\nI stifled a sigh. “Alright, so, when do we depart?”\n\n“Oh, no, Starfish. This is a trip I’m taking on my own.”\n\n“What?” I said, incredulous. “Since when?”\n\nHis apologetic smile creased his weathered face. “You know I've enjoyed every one of our trips together, but this one's different. Tristan said I had to take it on my own.”\n\nI crossed my arms. “Oh, really? Well, isn’t that a clever way of making sure there are no other witnesses to his boats’ 'spectacles'.”\n\n“It’s not that, he just doesn’t want to be held accountable. I had to sign a waiver.”\n\n“*He made you sign a waiver*? Grandpa!”\n\n“Starfish, please, don’t worry.” He placed a gentle hand on my shoulder. “I know what I’m doing.”\n\n“And I’m not letting you go alone. It’s your boat now, you’re free to let anyone you want board it.”\n\n“It doesn’t work that way. The waiver—”\n\n“Forget the damned waiver.”\n\n“I can’t. I signed it.”\n\n“Where is it?”\n\n“With him.”\n\n“How do I find him?”\n\n“He only talks to clients.”\n\n“That’s bullshit. Give me his number, I’m going to—\" \n\n“Ramona, enough.” The gravity in his gaze silenced my turmoil. “Trust me, let me do this on my own.”\n\n“But, Grandpa—”\n\n“Trust me.”\n\n“I do, but I love you and—”\n\n“I love you too, and I’m grateful I can share so much with you.\" He gave me a wistful smile. \"But this is something I’ve dreamt of for so long, and I don’t want to ruin what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Please, Starfish, let me do this. Let me fulfill my dream.”\n\nI nodded, but my turbulent thoughts remained stubborn. I trusted my grandfather, but I didn’t trust Tristan. Not only did he prey upon the hopeful by offering them empty promises, he forced them to sign waivers releasing him from all liability.  He was nothing more than a heartless charlatan, and I wasn’t going to let him hurt my grandfather anymore than he already had.\n\nMy grandfather waved goodbye as I drove away, but I didn’t go far. After waiting for him to disappear below deck, I parked a distance away and snuck onto *Soul’s Oasis*. I didn’t know what kind of tricks Tristan had set up to fool his clients, but I was ready to dismantle every last one. My grandfather wasn’t going to fall victim to any ridiculous projections, speakers, or animatronics.\n\nThe layout of *Soul’s Oasis* was different from *Dancing Dawn’s*, the old boat where my grandfather taught me everything there was to know about boating. With the added struggle of remaining out of view, I found myself stumbling around, even more so once the sun had set. Despite the setbacks, I was determined, yet despite my determination, I didn’t come across anything suspicious.\n\nA rumble startled me, and I jumped, stifling a cry as I bashed my head against the bottom of the staircase. My pulse racing, I ran to the window, and my heart dropped along with my jaw as I saw the trail of froth leading away from the docks. I hadn’t expected my grandfather to take off so soon.\n\nI whipped around, my wide eyes searching the darkness for answers. I could come clean. Explain why I’d stowed away. My grandfather had forgiven me for a lot over the years, I could see him understanding my concern and excusing my disobedience. I bit my lip in uncertainty. Then again, I’d never done anything behind his back this audaciously. I broke his trust, and that would break his heart.\n\nNo, I’d rather remain hidden until we returned the next morning. It was going to be uncomfortable, but not as uncomfortable as appearing to have no confidence in my own grandfather. And this didn’t have to be a bad thing. I could now keep an eye on him all night and continue to search the boat for anything suspicious. I just had to make sure I laid low.\n\nThe bump on my head throbbed to the rhythm of my agitated pulse, and I winced as I rubbed it. To my shock, my hand came back warm, wet, and sticky. Thinking fast, I removed my sweater and wrapped it around the wound like a bandana. The last thing I needed right now was a hemorrhaging head injury.\n\n“Ramona?”\n\nI gasped and ducked down, my heart stuttering in my throat. How did my grandfather know I was here? I barely made a sound!\n\n“Ramona, you’re here.”\n\nConfusion swirled within my fear. My grandfather only called me Ramona when he was upset with me. But this whispered voice didn’t sound upset. It sounded … overjoyed. \n\n“I knew you loved me. I knew it. You tried to deny it for so long, but you couldn’t deny your heart. I’m here for you, my butterfly.”\n\nIce flooded my veins.\n\nMy butterfly.\n\nOnly my stalker called me \"my butterfly\".\n\n“You look as beautiful as always. I’ve missed you.”\n\nThose last three words resonated in my ear, and I squeaked in terror and jerked away, my wild eyes scanning the room as I plastered myself to the wall. “No, y-you’re … you're not here.”\n\n“I am here. For you, my butterfly.”\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut, my voice cracking through my hyperventilating breaths. “No, This … this isn’t happening. This can’t be real.”\n\n“My love for you have always been real. And now you show up, proving you’ve always loved me back, in your own way. Leaving your curtains open just a tantalizing sliver. Getting Fang so you could walk her twice a day past my car. Keeping the kitchen window open while you cooked so I could hear you sing along to the radio …”\n\nHis words carved through my prickling skin, releasing traumatic memories I’d spent years struggling to tame. Tears welled in my eyes and I hugged myself, shivering as I tried to fight past the madness I’d found myself in. This couldn’t be Tristan’s trickery. He didn’t know me. He didn’t know about my stalker. He didn’t even know I was going to be a stowaway.\n\nYet if this wasn’t fake, then that only left one other possibility.\n\nTristan wasn’t a charlatan. He offered the real deal.\n“I d-don’t know how this is happening, but I never loved you,” I said, fighting to control the fear in my voice. “You harassed me. Stalked me. Terrified me. You tried to kidnap me!”\n\n“I never meant to scare you. I love you. I can’t imagine myself without you. After my arrest, the idea of never seeing you again was too much to bear. But today, you showed up. You showed up! You were a beacon in the dark, and I came running, my butterfly. Now we can be together forever.\"\n\n\"Wh-what do you mean?\" I asked, hugging myself tighter.\n\n\"You came to be with me, and I'm here for you. Together we'll finally be free to love. You have no idea how much I’ve suffered without you, yearning for just a glimpse of your smile, a whiff of your perfume, a—”\n\nPanicking to the point of nausea, I burst out of the room and ran up the stairs, my shrill words quaking as I yelled, “Grandpa!”\n\nI jumped up on the deck, panting as I looked around in a frenzy. There, facing the bow, was my grandfather, his back to me as he looked out towards the starry horizon.\n\n“Grandpa!” I cried out as I ran over.\n\nHe didn’t turn around, so I slid in front of him, and my heart sank at his trance-like state. “Grandpa? Can you hear me?” I asked, shaking him.\n\nA flash of clarity streaked across his face, and he frowned as his eyes focused on me. “Starfish?”\n\n“Yes! We have to get off this boat!”\n\nHe blinked, his confusion growing. “What are you doing here?”\n\n“I’m sorry. I only wanted to protect you. I was so sure Tristan had set up gimmicks to trick you. I didn’t think … it could be real.”\n\nHis eyes twinkled as he smiled. “You can hear her too?”\n\n“Her?”\n\n“Vivienne.”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“My true love.”\n\nI frowned. “I thought grandma was your true love.”\n\n“Your grandma is wonderful, but Vivienne … she's my first love. My only true love.” He turned back towards the water, his eyes glazing above a lopsided smile. “She’s here. She came when she saw me. Do you hear her?”\n\n“No, but I did hear my stalker. Do you remember him? The one who took his life after he was arrested for attempted kidnapping?”\n\n“Oh, I could float for days in your poetry …”\n\n“Grandpa!” I shook him again. “Please listen to me!”\n\nHe turned back to me with a disoriented pout. “What’s wrong?”\n\n“My dead stalker! He said he came when he saw me and wants us to be together forever!”\n\n“Together forever.” A dreamy look swept across his face as he glanced up. “Yes, mon petit chou. We’ll be together forever where no sickness can tear us apart.”\n\n“Grandpa!”\n\nI grabbed his head and forced him to look at me, and his irritation surfaced above his stupor. “Ramona. What are you doing?”\n\n“We’re in danger! We have to get off this cursed boat!”\n\n“We’re not in danger.”\n\n“When a dead person says they want to be together forever, what do you think that means?”\n\nHis cheeks pushed against my hands as he smiled. “It means I can be with my Vivienne …”\n\n“It means you’ll die!”\n\n“That’s okay.”\n\n“It’s *not* okay! Grandpa, you have family here!”\n\n“They don't need me. I just want to be with Vivienne.”\n\n“We *do* need you! And if we stay, I’ll die too! I don’t want to die!”\n\nMy words broke through his haze and he frowned. “Why will you die?”\n\n“Because my dead stalker wants me to join him!”\n\n“Your stalker? Why’s he here?”\n\n“I don’t know! He said he saw me and came running!”\n\n“How? Tristan said he built this boat only for me.” His gaze darted to the sweater wrapped around my head. “You hurt yourself?\"\n\n“Yes, and I'm bleeding a lot. Yet another reason we should get back to land!”\n\nHe clenched his fist around the bandage on his hand, his expression heavy beneath his emotions. “You shouldn’t have come. Tristan didn’t take you into account. He says the strings of unrequited love don’t always run both ways, that’s why he offers regulated portals and privacy.”\n\nI frowned. “What do you mean? Wasn’t this whole thing just to prove ghosts existed?”\n\n“No, Starfish.” He looked up at the sky with a smile. “It was to reunite with my true love taken too soon.”\n\nI stared at him in disbelief. “So, you were planning on what? *Dying* tonight? All alone out here?”\n\n“Hmm …” He chuckled at a joke I couldn’t hear.\n\n“Grandpa, no! Snap out of it!” I held his face tighter. “Listen to me! I’m glad I came, because I don’t want you to die. This isn’t the answer. Your time will come, and Vivienne will wait for you.”\n\nHis smile wavered as he whispered, “But I don’t want to wait.”\n\n“Where are you, my butterfly?”\n\n“Oh, shit!” I let go of my grandfather and turned towards the deck, my pulse spiking. “Stay away from me, you criminal!”\n\n“You’re the criminal, Ramona. Stealing my heart and holding it captive all these years. But now, you show up to give me yours in return, confirming our destiny.”\n\nI gasped as a cold shock rippled beneath my skin, its tendrils grazing my rabid heart.\n\n“Grandpa! Something’s happening! We have to get off this boat!”\n\nAnother icy jolt filled my lungs, freezing my breath mid-scream as I fell to my knees. Shaking, I turned to my grandfather. He hadn’t reacted at all, his infatuation beyond help as he stood still, his yearning eyes reflecting the night’s grim promises. With his smile indented deep, he held his arms out to the sky, and dread spurred my determination. I didn’t know how it was going to happen, but I wasn’t going to let us die.\n\nFighting the arctic surges coursing through my body, I gritted my teeth and staggered towards the controls. If I could just steer this boat back to land and drag my grandfather out, perhaps all of this would stop. Wheezing, I gripped the wheel and threw my weight against it, my hope rising as *Soul’s Oasis* groaned and turned around. Yet hope didn’t last long as a frigid shroud suffocated me, sticking to every inch of my trembling skin.\n\n“It won’t be long, my butterfly.”\n\nGasping for air, I writhed and thrashed, pleas of desperation squeaking through my clenched jaw. Spasming as I fought for life, I crashed against the controls, and my rioting heart leapt to my throat as I found myself airborne.\n\nThe ocean’s salty warmth thawed my torment, and I coughed and sputtered as I broke through the surface. *Soul’s Oasis* was upside down, rumbling between foaming bubbles. Treading water, I whipped around wide-eyed, panting as I tried to find my grandfather in the inky depths surrounding me.\n\n“Grandpa!” I screamed between frantic dives. “Grandpa!”\n\nI searched long after the boat sank, yet when dawn danced across the waves and I was rescued, weeping in resignation, all I could hope for was that *Soul's Oasis* lived up to her name.\n\n\\-----\n\n[SR](https://www.reddit.com/r/skittishreflections)",

        "text": "Before we get into the story I must tell you guys some backstory. The events told                 \nwithin this story is completely true, even to the last tiny detail. Additionally, I would like to say the comments are gonna be turned off on this post. Reason being the point is not discussion, but to bring awareness on how movies can have horrific effects. Now I will tell you about myself. I am former CIA agent Robert B. Grahams, code name Rollo 14 under the Directorate of Analysis. I was the head of the secret Task Force 6145, our objective was to research the effects of entertainment on people's minds. This in itself isn’t bad, but… the experiments and purpose of our research were… horrific. \nAt the beginning the experiments were simple. We used simple meta-analysis to prove.          \nthe theory that entertainment affects people's view on reality and their attitudes towards (Kubrack, 2020). After reporting our findings to the higher ups, they changed our focus to how entertainment affects people's view on foreign countries. So we conducted an experiment where we made some youth watch movies about foreign countries, and then surveyed their opinions towards the country. The results indicated that the movies had affected their views on the foreign countries (Kubrak, 2020). Following this conclusion, the executives put pressure on the task force to drastically increase the intensity of the experiments. Furthermore, they demoted me from my position of leadership and took full control of the task force experiments. After the change, we forced our test subjects, death row convicts, to watch propaganda movies about foreign countries. After the change in test subjects, we weren’t certain that the movies would have the same effect, because personal factors are generally the basis in which people are influenced by the movies (Kubrack, 2020). We forced them to watch these movies for a duration of 24 hours every other day for an entire month. Then after an entire week we questioned them on their opinions. The effects of the experiment were shown within the first week. We asked questions about their opinion on the countries. They answered in a way that showed negative-leaning opinions. The next week the results showed completely negative opinions on the foreign countries. In the third week something seemingly snapped. Through the questions the inmates showed an indifference towards the countries portrayed in the films. When asked about their feelings towards the leader of the country they responded with, “yeah, he is okay”. In the last week of the experiments the subjects became completely unresponsive to the questioning.  We recorded  these findings and brought them to the directors.\n After receiving the data, they issued our orders.  We would repeat the experiment                \nthree more times.  After I received the orders, I quickly replied that I wouldn’t follow through since it was wrong. They immediately coerced me by the use of threats. Using my family as their means, I didn't dare refuse. So the experiments continued for three months. At the end of the three months the experiments finally came to a close. Abruptly the task force was dissolved and every member of the force was forced to sign an NDA about the research that we procured. Obviously in me posting this information I’m violating my NDA but I must tell you about the research purpose. \nThe month following the conclusion of the experiments, cataclysmal events began                     \nto erupt in the Middle-East; cities bombed by terrorists, people of leadership assassinated, places of worship destroyed, and utility grids completely broken. There were an estimated 200,000 dead and almost twice that missing. These events were truly gut wrenching themselves, but what was truly horrifying was when they showed the pictures of the perpetrators. Every single one of them were the death row inmates we had experimented on a couple months prior…",

        "text": "\n \n \nMy grandfather's a tough old man. Probably the toughest person I've ever met, even now; especially now. \nHe was a farmer all his life, working the fields alone, turning down offers of help from family, and the local teenagers that came looking for a job. \nWe all believed he was just too proud to accept help. Too set in his ways to trust his livelihood to someone else. And for a while I think that was true. \nEventually though, in his late 60's he had little choice but to bring someone else on following a farming accident that cost him his left arm, and almost his life. \nHe continued to work the farm however, and still does to this day, well into his 90's. He's the youngest 92 year old I've ever known. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast fall my wife Mila and I spent the week at my parent's, helping them out with some minor renovations.\nIt was during our last day of our visit that I decided to take Mila to visit my grandparents. She'd only met them once before at our wedding, and I didn't want to leave Oregon without seeing them. \nSo that morning we said goodbye to my folks, and drove the forty minutes to my grandparents farm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop and Gram were delighted to see Mila and I. They insisted we stay for dinner, which meant we would likely miss our flight home, but we couldn't say no, seeing as how little I got to see them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMila helped Gram out in the kitchen, listening to embarrassing stories of my youth, while I helped Pop out with the cows. It was just like old times, just him and I, cleaning up after the cows, while listening to his stories.\nIt was mid October, and prime time for corn harvesting. I offered to help out in the fields, but he turned me down flat. Said his hired guy would be doing it. Instead we settled on the back porch, each sipping on a frosty bottle of MOAB, the rich scent of my grandma's roast mixing with the crisp autumn air. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop leaned back in his old rocker, the stump of his left arm resting on his chest. He'd never gotten a prosthetic. Refused to even try it on. \nI was eight when he'd had his accident, and I can still remember the day well. I'd been visiting for the weekend, and had been helping my gram with the inside chores as I had come down with a slight cold that week and she didn't want me helping pop with the corn until I felt better. I remember being upset. I loved riding the picker with pop.  \nBut gram was good at making even the most boring chores fun, and I had nearly forgotten about the corn as grandma let me lick the bowl free of cookie dough. I was holding up the glass bowl when I saw it. A blur of color passing in front of the kitchen window. I'd put the bowl down and hopped off the counter to get a better look. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI nearly screamed when I saw it. I think I may actually have screamed, because in a moment my gram was at my side, screaming too. \nShe ran outside, but I was glued to the floor. I couldn't comprehend what I was seeing. \nPop was on his knees, his jean jacket slick with blood. His normally sun kissed face was completely pale, except for the ring of crusted blood around his mouth. He was holding his left arm, or what remained of it. Bits of torn flesh hung between his fingers as blood spurted out with every beat of his heart.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of the day is a blur to me, but I remember my mother holding me at the hospital, and listening as pop told us what happened. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe'd been in the field, harvesting corn, when a horse charged through the woods that separated their farm from their neighboring farm a few miles away. The horse ran straight to pop, and so he shut off the picker and hopped down to grab the horse. \nBut just as he was getting the horse to calm down so that he could take hold of her, the horse reared back on her hind legs, knocking my pop back into the picker. Before he could get to his feet, the horse somehow managed to knock into the picker, turning it on. \nMy pop's hand was sucked right up into the rollers and taking more with it every second. He didn't have a phone, and no one around to hear him scream, so he did the only thing he could. He reached in his back pocket for his pocket knife, and got to cutting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop never talked about it again after that day, no matter how many times he was asked. \nBut sitting on the porch with him that October afternoon something compelled me to ask to hear the story again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Why would you want to hear something like that?\" He mumbled, side eyeing me. \n\n\n\n\n\"Because, it's pretty heroic.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Heroic my ass.\" He grunted, shaking his head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mila would love to hear it. I've told her, of course, but no one tells a story better than you.\" I said with a wink. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe looked away from me then, and for a moment he looked just like he did the day I saw him through the kitchen window covered in his own blood. He had a look of terror in his eyes. One I'd never seen before or since. I reached out and put my hand on his shoulder, giving it a light squeeze.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You ok Pop?\" I asked, ready to hop up and get my gram. He nodded his head and took a sip of his MOAB with a shaky hand. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'm okay.\" He said, setting his bottle between his legs, and running his fingers over the stump of his left arm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You sure? You look kind of pale.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I said I was.\" He said firmly, but not in any way unkind. Pop never was one to be fussed over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI sat back in my seat, quietly sipping from my own bottle. \nWe sat in silence for a while, and just as the sky started to turn a reddish orange, he cleared his throat. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You were here that day, you remember that?\" He asked, still staring off into the fields that stretched before us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI knew immediately what he was referring to, and told him that I did remember. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You were small, not much more than six or seven. I'm surprised you remember at all. But I guess it must be hard to forget something like that.\" He said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was definitely scary seeing you covered in blood. I was just glad you were okay. Could have been so much worse.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe grunted, and wiped his brow, that I could see was starting to bead with sweat despite the chill. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It certainly could have been a lot worse, you ain't kidding. Sometimes I still feel it, you know.\" He said turning to look at me. \"My arm. It feels like it's still there sometimes. Sometimes I even go to scratch it, but my hands feel this nub and it all comes rushing back to me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It must have been terrifying. I can't imagine having to cut off my own arm.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was terrifying, but not because I had to cut my arm off.\" He said. \"There's something I never told you about that day. I never told anyone, matter of fact. And I never planned on it.\" He looked back at me, his gray eyes burning with determination. \"But if you want to know, really want to know, I'll tell you. But you'll promise me you won't repeat it to your mother or grandma. I don't want them thinking I've lost my damn mind.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I didn't say anything he took hold of my arm and squeezed. \"Well? Do you want to know?\" He asked. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I do.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"And do you promise not to tell your mother or grandma?\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\"I promise pop.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nHe let out a long breath as if he'd been holding it in, and gave a quick look over his shoulder at the kitchen window. Inside Mila and gram's faint laughter could be heard. He relaxed back into his rocker, taking a small sip from his bottle before starting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You know some of it already. What I told the family at the hospital, that was partly true. A horse knocked me down, and my arm got wedged in the rollers. I had to cut it off with this Winchester.\" He said, pulling out an ancient looking pen knife, and running his thumb over it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"My father gave this to me when I was 14, and I've kept it with me ever since. There's been plenty of times I've left the house without my keys, or my wallet, but never once forgot this knife.\" He wrapped his fist around the rusted handle, and wiped his brow with the sleeve of his blue flannel shirt. \n\n\n \n\n\n\"I'd taken the picker out to the west field that day. We'd just bought the land over there earlier in the year and this was the first time I'd ever harvested that section. The moment I got there I felt a change in the air, as if it was heavier there somehow. I could feel it with every breath I took, like what breathing in water must feel like. I shoulda come straight back right then. But I didn't. I guess I thought it was just in my damn head.\" He was gazing off in the distance towards the west field, the tips of swaying corn just barely visible from our place on the porch. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Anyway, I got to work, and even though that feeling was still there, I did my best to ignore it. I was halfway through when I heard something. You know how loud that damn picker is, but I could still hear it even over the roar of the picker. I shut it off and hopped out and the sound nearly knocked me off my feet. It's crazy, but it sounded like a freight train was coming towards me. I swear it even felt like the ground was vibrating under my feet. I didn't have time to think about what it could be, because within seconds I saw what it was. But it sure as hell wasn't what I expected. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A horse came galloping right outta the woods that runs along the edge of the corn, and it looked like it'd been running for days. It took one look at me with wild eyes and ran straight at me. As if I'd been his target all along. She galloped straight at me, weaving and winding her way through the corn. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I could tell right away that she was terrified. I put my arms up and tried to calm her down as she barreled right at me, and after a minute there she was starting to settle. She was exhausted, that much I could tell right away and she looked a little hurt too. I could see some scrapes on her hind, and one gash on her nose. I thought maybe she'd run through a fence over on Bill's farm. I decided I'd take her over to him, get her fixed up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I grabbed her by the bridle, and started to lead her back towards the woods over by Bill's. It was a ways, but I didn't want to leave her unattended for too long.\" He took a gulp from his bottle, and wiped his face.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You don't have to keep going pop..\" I said, starting to feel concerned. \"We can go inside if you want.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No, I want to finish. I got to tell someone, Nate. I've kept it in too damn long and the weight of it is suffocating me.\" He said. Before I could respond he continued with his story. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I tried pulling that horse towards the woods, but she dug into the ground and refused to budge. It was slow going but I managed to get her to take a couple steps\nwhen I heard that sound again. Like something awfully big was coming straight at us. I was looking towards the woods where the sound was coming from, and I thought I could see something moving around in there. I couldn't see it clearly, but I could see something. Something white, moving between the trees. And it was moving fast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Just as….whatever the hell that thing was started to emerge through the treeline, the horse reared back on her hind legs knocking me over into the picker. I was stunned for a second, then started to pull myself up, but then I laid my eyes on what that horse saw; what she'd been running from.\" He looked back up, his eyes large and scared, staring off into that far off field. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"What was it pop?\" I asked, my voice nothing more than a whisper. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know. It sure as hell wasn't another horse, I know that. It wasn't any kind of animal I'd ever seen in my life. It looked more like a man than an animal, though I'm not sure why cause it didn't look like any man I'd ever seen either. It was shaped like one, being it had two legs, and two arms. But its skin was a white scaly gray, and it had these hooked claws on the ends of its fingers that it would dig into the earth to pull itself along. It was crawling for some reason. Sort of dragging itself forward.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Jesus Christ.\" I whispered. Normally Pop would have snapped at me for using the Lord's name in vain, but he didn't seem to notice or care in that moment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"That thing….. was grinning at me, Nate. Grinning with its head bobbing from side to side and giggling like a little kid. The vision of that thing crawling through the dirt towards me…. Has haunted my nightmares for years.\" He said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the hell was it?\" I asked. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop shrugged, and took a drink. \"I don't know. But it was coming right at me. It wasn't moving too fast at that point, not like it was in the woods. I don't know if it was tired or what, but I wasn't planning on asking it. I tried to get to my feet, but that damn horse must have seen that thing coming and she went berserk. She slammed into the picker and somehow  turned it on, then she took off through the field. Those rollers swallowed my hand before I even had a chance to blink. I felt it before I saw it. The bones crushing on my fingers. Still, I wasn't thinking about the pain. I suppose it was the adrenaline, but all I could think about was that thing getting closer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was already moving across the field at that point, and I was stuck. I tried pulling, but those rollers were sucking my hand in by the second, and before I knew it my wrist was sucked up inside too. I couldn't turn it off, and no matter how loud I screamed no one would hear me out there anyway.  \nI figured I was gonna die right there. Either from the picker or that thing. It was moving at a steady pace, almost like it was enjoying it. And it was too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How do you know?\" I asked. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because it was grinning, Nate. Its eyes were wide and locked on me and it was smiling this great big grin that showed off every one of them teeth. And those teeth were sharp. Even I could see that from across the field. The closer it got the more I could see, and I thought I'd lose my mind if I had to stare at that thing any longer. \nThose milky white eyes and that smile, I'd never seen something so evil, and I pray I never will again.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What did you do?\" I asked. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\"Thankfully I remembered my father's knife, and pulled it out. At first I held it for protection, in case that thing got close enough. But by the time the rollers had eaten up part of my arm, damn near to the elbow, I knew I could either start cutting, or wait around til that thing got to me, and by then who knows how much of me the picker would have eaten.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I decided I wasn't waiting around to find out. So I started cutting as fast as I could. I didn't even feel it. I was too scared of that thing getting to me. \nIt saw me cutting at my arm and I swear I could see the panic in its eyes for just a second. It knew I might get away and it didn't like that. It started moving faster then. Taking big strides with its long arms, sending dirt flying in the air. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Its eyes were even wider, its smile bigger somehow too. So big I think I heard its skin tear and I could hear it making this sound as it scrambled towards me. Loud enough to hear with that picker going. Like a grunting sound. Raspy and deep. I was so scared I started using my own teeth. By the time that thing reached the start of my corn, I was almost free. I was still attached to the picker, but only by the bone. For a moment I was worried I wouldn't be able to break it, not in the position I was in. But luckily for me I didn't have to. The picker took care of that pretty quickly, and I fell back on my ass. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I scooted away from that thing, my blood spurting out every which way. I still had my father's knife, and I held it out in front of me, though I don't know if it would have done much good.\nIt was pretty close at that point, right next to the picker. \nI kept scooting back, holding that knife out waiting for it to lunge. But it didn't. It stopped crawling, and sat back on its legs, watching me with those eyes that were full of malice. Like it was studying me, seeing if I was any sort of threat. After a minute or two it growled, and turned its attention to the picker. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It crawled up to it and sniffed at the rollers a bit. Then it reached down in those rollers and yanked my arm out of it. I don't know how it was able to get it without getting itself pulled in, but it did. It took what was left of my arm in its mouth, and started crawling backwards into them woods, watching me the entire way. \nIt stopped at the treeline and even from the distance I could see it smiling at me. It disappeared in the trees but I didn't move until I was sure it wasn't coming back. By then I'd lost a lot of blood, was close to losing consciousness. I pretty much crawled all the way home. Blacked out a few times, but every time I thought I wouldn't get back up, I'd see that damned smile and somehow I'd get the strength to get to my knees again.\" He closed his eyes tight, shaking his head as if to clear the memory from his mind. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And?\" I said, completely immersed in his story. \n\n\n\n\n\nHe sighed, and tucked his knife in his back pocket. \"And you know the rest. I made it home somehow. God must have given me the strength.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But…  what happened to that… thing in the woods?\" I asked, my own eyes scanning the trees that seemed so much closer than they had before Pop's story. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That I can't tell you. And you know, I don't think I want to know. Some things aren't meant to be found, Nate. And that thing was one of 'em.\" He said, draining his beer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Did you ever see it again?\" I asked. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop shook his head. \"Nope, and I hope I never will. I stopped working the west field after that. Never stepped foot on it again after that day. Hired Hank Reidy to do it for me. I didn't want to. I didn't want to do anything with that land, but your grandma didn't understand why I wanted to let the land go to shit. Not after spending so much to buy it. I couldn't tell her the truth. She'd think I'd gone crazy. So I hired Hank, and he harvests the corn for me.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI looked at the corn in the west field, swaying in the breeze, and I couldn't help but imagine some horrible gangly creature with a gaping smile, waiting out there in the stalks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop clapped his hand on my shoulder, pulling my gaze away from the west field. \"Your grandma thought I stopped using the picker because I was scared. As if I was afraid I'd lose the other arm. \nAnd she was partly right. I was afraid. But not of that damn picker. I was afraid of that field, Nate.  Still am. Afraid of those woods that bordered it, and the places in the corn where things can hide. Afraid that whatever the hell that thing was that took my arm would come back for the rest of me.\" He stood and smiled down at me with an almost relieved look on his face. \"Come on, smells like dinner's about ready.\" \n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI never for a second doubted my Pop's story. Not just because I trust his word, but because when he told me, he was scared. And nothing scares Pop. \nI don't know what he saw out in the woods that day, but whatever it was it scared him enough to cut and bite through his own arm just to get away from it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat visit was the last time I saw my grandfather. He passed away three weeks ago. Heart attack, doctor said.\nI went out to help my gram pack some of his things away, and when I'd finished I contemplated heading on over to the west field, just to stare into those woods for myself.  But then I remembered the look of terror on my pop's face that day he lost his arm, and the day he told me how he'd lost it and I changed my mind.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop was right. Some things just shouldn't be found. ",

        "text": "I was awakened from a deep sleep by the creaking sound of my room door. I live alone. Um, I must have been dreaming. I want to change position, but I can't move. What the hell! Come on! I'm running around the room with my eyes frantically, but I can't see anything. It's dark. Only a sliver of moonlight shines through the blinds. Someone's running towards my room! I hear heavy stomping. My heart is beating like crazy. I'm scared to death. I can't see anything. He has stopped somewhere in the area of the open door. I look at the door in a panic and see the darkness grow even darker.\n\nDid someone break into my apartment? But why can't I move? God, I never believed in you, but if you exist, help me. I hear the heavy step again. I'm trying to see what is in the pitch-black darkness, but I can't see anything. Tears are squeezing from my eyes from the effort. I feel a bone-chilling cold. It's like someone turned on the air conditioner and put it right in front of my face. My body is shivering. Please make it stop. Within a second, the temperature in the room rose a few degrees, and I felt a pleasant warmth. I can move again and feel calm. A stone fell from my heart.\n\nA few nights ago, I set up several cameras in the apartment because this strange situation repeats itself every night. I don't dare to look at the footage. I looked once and saw a tall figure in the hallway dressed in a trench coat and hat running toward my room. I turned off the footage out of horror and didn't dare to finish watching it. It repeats itself every night. I don't check the other cameras. I don't want to know what they captured.\n\nI uploaded a video of a shadowy figure to Reddit. Some people were freaked out by it, and others laughed at it, saying it was fake. Then I got the message: \"Address?\" At first, I didn't understand, but then the man elaborated more, and I understood that he was an exorcist and would help me.\n\nHe's finally here, but he doesn't look at all like an exorcist. He's dressed in a biker jacket and jeans. \"Hello.\" I greet him, but he won't even look at me. \"Stay here.\" He walks towards my room. After a while, he returns. He walks past me and speaks one word. \"Done.\" I have a strange feeling about this. I'll look at the footage. It doesn't matter what's on it now that it's gone.\n\nI see him walk down the corridor and stop in front of my bedroom door. Everything has gone dark. The shadowy figure in the hat appeared in front of him. The exorcist opened his mouth, and his jaw stretched down to the level of his chest. His hands went black, and his fingers stretched out like long claws and encircled the shadowy figure. He swallowed the shadowy figure. In the end, he caught a glimpse of the camera. He smiled into it. Then he walked away.\n\nI invited a monster into my house to get rid of another monster. I feel bad. I should feel relief, but it still doesn't come. I have a strong urge to look at the other footage. I'm panicked, scared, and terrified, but I need to know more. For God's sake!\n\nAccording to the night vision camera, a creature came out of the wall. It had an enormous skull of a goat. The creature was wearing a cloak. It looked like the cloak was sewn together from bits of skin. I don't know why the skin pieces came to mind. I can't tell from the night vision footage what it is. But my gut is whispering to me.\n\nWith a screech, it opened the door to my room and bared razor-sharp fangs. A shadowy figure ran out of the hallway with a stomp and attacked the goat's skull. The monster with the goat skull disappeared. The shadowy figure watched me for a moment and then left.\n\nBehind my back, the door is just opening with a creak. But this time, there is no one to save me. I've left my protector, the shadowy figure, to another monster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...",

        "text": "To this day, I still don't know why the true story of Moses 'Moze' Williams didn't make it into the local papers. I assume the journalists at our small newspaper press thought that no one would believe it. Or maybe the journalists themselves didn't believe it. If either or both were the case, I can't say that I blame the journalists. \n\nAnother possibility is that no one who saw Moze in his final hours told the journalists about what they saw. That scenario is also blameless. It makes sense that they wouldn't want anyone to disturb Moze in his final resting place. With what ended up happening to him, there would be novelty seekers swarming all over the place. \n\nPerhaps that was why my father swore me to secrecy when he told me what happened. \n\nMoze's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Williams, didn't know too much about what their 15-year-old son liked. What they did know is that he had seemed to develop a dislike for spending time with people. His parents rarely ever saw and talked to him, and when they did he never mentioned anything about friends. \n\nHowever, unlike a typical introvert, Moze didn't like to stay up in his room for hours at a time. He instead spent a good three to four hours after school going who knows where. He'd only come back when it was time for dinner and homework. \n\nHis parents, of course, had asked him several times where he went all afternoon. Moze would always respond to this question with silence or a sharp \"none of your business\". \n\nFearing the worst, Mr. and Mrs. Williams searched the boy's room for drugs, alcohol, or any other dangerous materials. Most of what they found were just books and clothes. Mrs. Williams also smelled her son's clothes before putting them in the laundry. She detected no traces of beer, weed, or tobacco. \n\nOn top of being drug and alcohol-free, Moze was still receiving good grades and acting well-behaved in school. He also went to church with the family on Sundays without any fuss. And when the Williamses asked other townsfolk if they had seen their son, most who had him said they'd seen him quietly writing and drawing in various places around town. \n\nAll of the facts seemed to prove that Moze was a good kid who just liked to spend time alone. Therefore, the parents concluded that they didn't need to pester or spy on their son any longer. He could have his privacy. \n\nOf course, a few weeks after they made this decision, Moze went missing for three days. He didn't come home from his wanderings or go to school and none of the neighbors saw him in town. \n\nSo the parents decided to organize a search party with many of the townsfolk. It was only after most of the search party members had gone off to search places where they had seen Moze last that my father, Office Chris Miller, made a suggestion. \n\n\"Did we check his room for any ideas as to where he went?\" \n\n\"We've already checked his room several times,\" Mrs. Williams said. \n\n\"Would you mind letting me take a more thorough look?\" \n\n\"Go ahead.\" \n\nAs soon as Officer Miller walked into the room, he seemed to act peculiarly. He tapped the walls, ran his hand along the edges of the furniture pieces, and lifted the mattress. Then his eyes turned to the vent. \n\n\"Ah,\" He walked over to the vent and pointed. \"See that? There's only one screw. It probably makes the space easier to access. Mind getting me a screwdriver, either of you?\" \n\n\"I'll go.\" Mr. Williams walked out of the bedroom and down the stairs. \n\nOfficer Miller shined his light into the vent to try and see what was in there. He looked over to Mrs. Williams. She looked as though she was about to cry. \n\n\"Do you think it's drugs,\" She asked. \n\n\"Well, to be honest, ma'am.\" Officer Miller stood up. \"Drugs don't usually make it to this town, so I wouldn't bet on it.\" \n\n\"What if it's something he stole?\" \n\n\"Look, ma'am.\" He reached over and put his hand on Mrs. Williams's shoulder. \"Teenagers can be secretive about stupid things. It's probably just porn or something. Also, don't worry! If it is something bad, I'll try to let him off as easily as I can.\" \n\nMrs. Williams smiled. \"Thank you, officer.\"\n\nMr. Williams came back with the screwdriver and handed it to Officer Miller. My father kneeled and removed the vent cover screw with a few turns. He pulled the cover off and peered inside. \n\n\"Well, look at what we've got here.\" \n\nOfficer Miller reached inside and pulled out a black notebook. He stood up and offered the journal to Mr. Williams. \n\n\"Here, sir! I think you should be the one to look at this first.\" \n\nMrs. Williams peeked over her husband's left hand as he opened the notebook. \"It's just some drawings of buildings.\" \n\n\"There are some words here too.\" Mr. Williams began to read the words. \n\nMe. Williams's hands began to shake as he did. He flipped over another page and a disgusted look came over his face. This look transformed into anger and he threw the book so that it landed pages down. \n\n\"Oh God, oh God!\" Mr. Williams put his right hand on his forehead. \"Not my son! Not my son!\"",

        "text": "A few years ago, I bought a small house in south west Maine. It’s one story, around 1,000 square feet. A few months after I bought the house, I got lonely, and decided to buy a dog, whose name is Ace.\n\nThere’s a forest outside my home. I never bothered to do any of the normal things people do when there’s a forest near them, like camp. However, Ace never liked the forest. He would bark or whine any time I took him on a walk where the tree line was visible.\n\nI started realizing what was happening last winter. Every tree began to wilt and die simultaneously. If one leaf fell off a tree, that leaf fell off of every tree. When it became spring, all the leaves grew back at the same time and place as well. It’s as if the forest grew as one.\n\nTwo months ago, Ace picked up the habit of scratching my door any time I had locked him out of my room. He always makes a mess when I let him in though, so I have to keep the door closed. Two weeks ago, l heard a yelp. It was not Ace though. It came from somewhere around the back of my house. After that sound, I heard Ace running and whining, and he started scratching my door. It wasn’t normal, though. It was frantic. \n\nI let him in my room, and I swear I already saw the damn thing in my yard. I saw that thing staring at my dog like it was a fucking smoker seeing a cigarette. I looked closer and all there was out there was the tree line, but I saw that thing out there, I know it. I couldn’t sleep, nor could Ace. I stayed up and just scrolled through social media.\n\nI don’t know what time it was but I heard a yelp again, and after that a long, disgusting groan. I couldn’t open my door, I couldn’t. I didn’t want to see those eyes turn into fucking trees. All I did was sit there, thinking of what to do if there was something out there.\n\nThe next morning, I don’t know why but I bought a pistol. Something told my to buy a pistol. It was some kind of a Glock, I don’t remember the exact name, and the name doesn’t matter. That night, it happened again. The yelping, groaning, scratching, and the fucking staring.\n\nThis time though, I went outside, the pistol at my hip. Either that thing was going to end up with a bullet hole in its head or I was going to die, and I would be damned if I let the latter happen.\n\nI was sitting there, in the maybe 20 degree weather, just waiting. But nothing happened. I waited and waited but there was nothing. Until Ace was scratching on my door. I looked around and saw it coming out of the tree line, the long pale limbs, the, maybe 4 different eyes, and I heard the groan. But it wasn’t a groan. It was a scream. The loudest scream I had ever heard.\n\nThe thing ran at me, and I drew my gun. I was still shooting it when it was down. I moved to grab my phone to call the police, and the second I turned around, it was gone. I called the police in shambles, not knowing what to do. \n\nI got a fine for “prank calling” 911, but I know what I saw. I have to move away, I can’t look at that forest ever again. I don’t know what is wrong with that forest, but it’s not normal. Maybe it’s cursed, maybe it’s haunted, or maybe this world has more secrets like this, waiting to emerge from the tree line.",

        "text": "“As we walked the halls of the asylum, we saw pain unfiltered, unadulterated pain. What pain this building held before it was shut down for the death of so many unnamed and forgotten inmates. Inmates imprisoned by their own families unable to cope with their disabilities.” Tom recited into his phone, with the self importance only a self proclaimed author could have. As if he was telling the most important story in the world, but it wasn’t a story. It would’ve been better suited for the Halloween special for a history podcast than a book.\n\nWe were walking down the hall of an abandoned asylum. On All Hallows Eve If we couldn’t be any more cliché. It was Tom’s idea to do a little urban exploring for Halloween this year. The part he didn’t tell me was that he needed something to write a new book about, he was too proud to say that he had no ideas though. “Why don’t we do something fun and exciting? We’ve been to every haunted house in a 100 mile radius! We’ve watched every horror movie, hell most of em we quote to each other as we are watching them.” Tom said with his begging pouty face that he knew always made me melt. That’s how I found myself in this dark damp asylum listening to Tom’s very audible internal monologue.\n\n“If that’s not the start of a best seller I don’t know what is!” Tom said as he mashed pause on his phone for the moment.\n\n“You know this place wasn’t actually shut down for any kind of suspicious reason other than lack of funding right?” I asked sounding a little more judgy than I intended.\n\n“Yes, I did research the same as you babe, but it’s a decent guess that horrible shit happened here when it was operating. It’s not like the mid fifties we’re prime time for mental health care. No, doubt lobotomies, electro shock therapy, and daily beatings were a common treatment in here as in any other ‘lunatic asylum’ during its time.” Tom stated with a gleam in his eye that reminded me about his passion and curiosity for the history of places like this. I nod my head to confirm he’s probably right.\n\nAs we walked and let that thought hang in the air I fumbled to get my gawdy oversized flashlight out of my backpack side pocket. Hoping Tom didn’t see the struggle, he had made several comments about the size of my flashlight while I bought it, and continued to make these comments every time I brought it out. I think he was secretly jealous.\n\n“Besides, if my books were ‘They walked into an asylum that’s definitely not haunted because nothing exciting ever happened there and they are simply going to scare theirselves into thinking they see a ghost.’ It wouldn’t be a very good book then would it?” Tom said in a comical fake narrator voice.\n\nTrying to hide my chuckles I replied “Okay, okay. I get your point. You can’t deny the prose though.”\n\n“Well that’s because I’m an impeccable writer, anything I write would be just as entrancing to read.” Tom gives me a playful look. “Why do you think you are dating me after all? It’s clearly my expansive vocabulary and flawless grammar!” Wiggling his eyebrows as he said it  in a look that he thought was cute but was more like Sherlock Holmes unraveling a mystery.\n\n“You’ve got some other traits I enjoy mister, don’t sell yourself short. It takes more than some fancy words and pristine comma placement to get me in an asylum.” I say as I pull him towards me.\n\n“What does it take to get you in an asylum hallway?” Tom said with a grin and a kiss. “I think I want you ri-“\n\n“Oh do you see this room? It would be perfect for my book. The scalpel on the operating table and the chairs facing it!” Tom exclaims as he runs into the room with childlike glee. That’s what I get for dating a writer I suppose, cock blocked by his “writers brain” as Tom called it. I called it having the attention span of a fish. He would start a sentence then get a thought in his head and he’s off writing in his head before ink ever desecrated the page, and there he goes.\n\n“When standing in the operating room or treatment room as they were more keen to call it, I feel the history of this place. The history of pain and suffering, people begging for help and being answered with violence and ignorance. A silver table that could tell you stories horrible enough to bring tears to the most stone hearted. Stories of children barely beginning life, being forced to have operations under the guise that it would help them.” He said looking off in the distance as if he were thinking of the most thought provoking and traumatic memories available for this monologue.\n\nHe pauses the recording again and looks at me, “Sorry, what were we talking about?” He asks in such an earnest expression I can’t help but laugh. “We were talking about how big of a ring you are gonna get me after you make a fortune of this book you are writing.” I say as smile and give him my puppy dog eyes. “Yeah okay babe. I’ll tell ya what if this book ends up being a best seller you can pick out any ring you want.” “Really! How much does it take to qualify as a best seller?” I ask with too much enthusiasm knowing he’s fucking with me. “That’s the whole point sweetie a lot more than I’m probably going to.” He says laughing. “How many did the last one sell?” I ask. Tom’s eyes flicker with that sad look he gets when he gets ready to put himself through the emotional ringer. “About 300 maybe.” He spits out as he turns and walks off leaving me staring at the silver table.\n\nI follow him out trying figure out a way to change the topic onto something more cheery. I walk down the hallway looking for something to ask a question on, one thing Tom always loved was educating the less knowledgeable. “So there aren’t any spooky Halloween stories about this place?” I ask knowing that will get his mind off whatever he’s bullying himself over in his head. “Yeah actually but I can’t quite remember it. I mean there’s all kinds of stories about ghosts in the windows and specters roaming the halls, but honestly if you have a haunted asylum and don’t have those stories what are you even doing?” Tom asks sarcastically, “I’d say that means your town is pretty unimaginative.”\n\n“Exactly right! This place breeds stories like that because you can look at it and it just gives you that vibe.” Tom says gesturing to the hallway surrounding us. “I mean it’s almost impossible to not think ghosts are gonna get you when you walk in here, right?” Tom asked\n\n“I mean yeah it’s an old abandoned asylum I’m not gonna lie and say it’s not creepy, but I think if you went into an abandoned McDonald’s it would be creepy too. These places are supposed to be full of people and noise not emptiness and dust.” I said.\n\n“Always the skeptic huh babe?” Tom replied rolling his eyes at me, he’d always been more of a believer than I. “Sorry babe but your never gonna convince me that everyone’s spirits are still wandering around looking for peace. It’s just not how things work in my head.”\n\n“And how does it work in your head?” Tom asked. “Well I guess my thing is there are a lot more people that don’t have unfinished business or vengeance to exact. What do they do go to heaven? And if you have unfinished business you stay on earth, why though? That only means that the people who were satisfied with their life can get into heaven? It just doesn’t make sense to me T…” stopping mid sentence I grab Tom and pull him into a room shooting off the hallway! Tom starts to talk but I cover his mouth and put my finger to my mouth as a warning. We aren’t alone.\n\nWe sit in the silence for a second when Tom gets impatient. “What? Did you see something?” He whispers. I did see something but I don’t know what I saw, it looked like a hand curling around the corner of the hallway wall. We were a little ways away from it but I’m certain I saw something. Not being able to think of the words in the moment to explain that I nod my head slowly.\n\n“Well what was it? A crackhead?” Tom asked more curious than concerned.\n\n“I don’t know it looked like a hand was on the corner of hallway.”\n\nTom snickers, “I appreciate you trying to get me in the spirit of the place sweetie, but it’s atmospheric enough without fake ghosts.”\n\n“I’m not joking Tom I really saw something at the end of the hallway!” I reply with a twinge of irritation rising in me. What did he think I was doing trying to come up with a story for his book?\n\n“Okay sure babe, but if someone is up there we should probably see who it is.” Tom said casually his voice returning to his normal volume.\n\n“Why the hell would we need to see who it is? I do not want to get stabbed by a homeless man today, do you?”\n\n“Because they might be hurt or need help.”\n\nI swear sometimes Tom honestly thought he was in one of his books where he had plot armor. I know that his heart was in the “right” place but that was possibly one of the stupidest ideas I’d heard in my life.\n\n“Why would someone who is hurt or need help be in here? Why would someone be in here anyway is the better question? Let’s just go we’ve seen a few rooms and I’m thoroughly creeped out, so mission accomplished!”\n\n“Yeah you might be right sweetie it might be best to let the crackheads have the run of the place.” Tom said realizing the insanity of what he had said.\n\nWe both stood up and eased our heads around the corner trying to see if the coast was clear, we decided it was. We ease out in the hallway and start quietly making our way towards the exit on the opposite end from the corner I had seen the hand.\n\nTwenty feet, we made it twenty feet from the door and then we heard it. A man’s scream paralyzed us, not a clear scream it sounded like he was convulsing as he screamed. Like he was mid seizure and screaming. And it was loud so loud that I would’ve thought it came from a speaker over our heads.\n\nWhen it finally stopped only seconds after it began we looked at each other, “What the fuck?” Is what I said but my voice didn’t work, my lips were dry and sticky. If only Tom’s voice showed the same absence.\n\n“We have to go check that out right? I mean who ever that was they definitely aren’t okay!” Tom said as he turned to go back down the hall. Having no desire to go back into that place I stood still weighing out the options in my head.\n\n_“The pros of leaving are we aren’t in any danger, we get to go home and forget about this whole night, and we don’t have to find out who made that noise. The cons of leaving are… a guilty conscience, possibly leaving someone to die in pain.”_\n\nI would like to that I wanted to go back in and make sure everything was okay inside but…\n\n“Tom we need to get the fuck out of here right now. There’s no way I’m going back in there to find where that came from!” It came out of my mouth without hesitation no debating necessary.\n\nTom stopped and looked back “Go wait in the car then. I’m going to see if they need my help.” He started back down the hall.\n\n“Wait this isn’t one of your books you aren’t the hero, why don’t we call the cops?” I whispered at him.\n\n“Trespassing sweetie it’s a crime, and I don’t want to call them if it’s nothing and they arrest us. If you would like to go to jail then sure go out get in the car and call.” He said even toned but with a look that said that was the end of the discussion.\n\n“Fine but if you aren’t back in 5 minutes I’m calling the cops!” I felt like shit as I said it. Like a coward who had been exposed. I didn’t even like the horror stuff like he did, I did all of this stuff for him and his books. I’m not getting murdered so he can have a good experience to write about! Fuck him if that’s what he wants.\n\nI walked out of the hall towards the car, opened the door, sat down and locked the door behind me. Then I waited. Five minutes, ten minutes, at fifteen I started trying to call the cops. To no one’s surprise there was no phone service. If he’s not back by 11:45 I’m leaving to get help, I told myself thank God I kept the keys in my backpack.\n\nAfter thirty minutes right as I started to swap seats to crank the car, I saw him. It was Tom coming out of the asylum! He was moving slow and stiff like he twisted his ankle.\n\n“Hey are you okay?” I asked “What was the noise? Was there someone in there?”\n\nHe kept walking towards with no answer.\n\n“Tom quit fucking with me, I’m sorry I didn’t go back in with you but what was it, I want to know!” I said trying not to give away the twinge of fear I was starting to feel. He was getting close now still making no sign or even hint that he had heard me. Then a horrible thought hit me.\n\n_What if it’s not Tom? It’s dark all you can see is it’s a person. What if this is the screaming man? What if it’s who made the man scream?_\n\nPanicking I turned and looked for my flashlight in my pack, trying to find it before the figure reached me. I had about sixty seconds before he was on me. Unzipping my pack I reached in my hand shooting to where the flashlight should be. I felt a hand on my shoulder latch on and start pulling me back. Flash light in hand I mash at the button on the hilt.\n\nLight exploded blinding me for a brief second before I saw it. It was Tom, his eyes were dim and unfocused, he didn’t look like he even knew what was happening or what he was doing. That’s when I realized it wasn’t Tom, not the same Tom that I had left in that place. Tom had a huge bloody chunk out of his head showing off way too much of his skull. Then his hand found my arm, it was ice cold like a corpse, maybe that’s what he was now. He had a hell of a grip in those hands, he latched on and started dragging me back to that damned building!\n\nStumbling and trying to get my footing I slapped at the thing with no avail. Until I felt the flash light still in my fist. I planted my feet in to the ground enough to put as much room between the thing and me as possible and swung!\n\nThe sound was a resounding thud! The flash light connected to Tom’s head hard enough to break his exposed skull into pieces. Tom staggered his hand let go of my arm and he dropped to the ground, flash light still in his head exposing the gore of the man I loved. Now with the light it looked like his neck had been broke.\n\nAfter that I don’t know what happened, I don’t remember anything. I can guess I got in my car a drove myself home to my, our apartment, since I woke up there a day later. It’s all an empty space in my head however.\n\nI don’t know what happened in that place or what took Tom but I know I won’t be going back.",

As he should be.\n\nAs for me, I was broken. At first, I couldn't believe it.\n\nI would ask her if she'd like me to buy her something - and then immediately say, \"Oh right. You're dead.\"\n\nWhen people tried to console me, I'd be all surprised.\n\nOne night, I was visited by a ghost. Or a spirit of some kind. A floating transparent woman. I couldn't help but feel that had something to do with my loss, although she didn't resemble my wife in the slightest.\n\nI thought it would be best to hide. Who knows what this ghost wants to do to me, right. She called me, asked me to come out, said I would be visited by four more, but I lay below the bed and didn't say anything. I just prayed that she wasn't real.\n\nAfter that night, I became angry with the world. How could it? How could it take away my wife, and leave others' wives alive?\n\nI would yell at my co-workers and face no repercussions, which made me even angrier.\n\nOne night, another ghost visited me. She looked like the first one, but not exactly: sisters, perhaps.\n\nBut this time, I was ready. I didn't hide like a coward. I sprayed her with holy water and when it hadn't worked, I started hitting her with a knife. She tried to reason with me, but I was unreasonable.\n\nAfter that night, though, I got an idea. I patiently waited for the next ghost, and when she arrived, I started begging her to give me my wife back.\n\nShe said that there was no way, that those who are dead need to stay that way.\n\nAfter that, I lost all interest in everything. What's the point of doing anything, if that doesn't bring my wife back?\n\nI wouldn't go to work, or eat, or sleep. No point.\n\nOne night, the fourth ghost appered. But that made no difference to me. We just stared at each other the whole time. In her eyes, instead of a reflection, I saw the scene of my wife's death. And then it was morning.\n\nAnd now I know what to do. Yes, my wife died and there's nothing I can do about it. But I can ask the fifth ghost to take me to the world of the dead. And if she refuses, I'll do it myself. Goodbye.",

        "text": "The first time I spotted the Countdown Man was on the bus to school when I was in 7th grade. I’d never seen an adult on my bus before, much less one dressed in a black suit, but no one else said anything, so I figured he belonged there.\n\nThen, as we drove around the neighborhood and picked up more kids, he counted down from 10. He spoke only in numbers, never another word. Nine: Billy Cunningham. Eight, seven, six: the Paulson kids. Five: Danny Wu. Four, three, two, one: the Smiths and Kerns. \n\nAnd then Audrey Blake walked into the bus and dropped dead.\n\nThe Countdown Man gave me a sad smile as he straightened his coat and walked down the aisle, stepping gingerly over Audrey’s body and down the bus steps. \n\nLater, they’d tell us Audrey had a heart condition, totally undiagnosed since birth. But I knew the truth. It could have been anyone. The next person to set foot in that bus was going to die.\n\nI saw him again a few times as the years passed. \n\nOnce in a club the night I turned 21. I was going shots when I spotted him at the bar, watching the door and counting down. It was such a busy night, that the whole thing took seconds. First, a screaming group of girls poured in for a bachelorette party. \n\nThen a couple came in, holding hands. The guy must have been half a step in front of the girl, because he was the one that dropped dead. After that, she was the one screaming while everyone else went silent.\n\nPeople died on airplanes, NBA games, school picnics.\n\nOnce, it even happened on an elevator. The doors opened, and I saw him there. He smiled weakly at me, and then a pregnant mother entered and he said *two, one.* I stayed there, frozen in place as a man pushed past me and promptly fell to the ground writhing, foam pouring from his mouth.\n\nAfter that, I didn’t see the man for a few years. I started to wonder if I’d even seen him. And then came my son Evan’s seventh birthday.\n\nWe held the thing at one of those family fun centers with arcade games, mini golf, and go-kart races. It was meant to be a surprise, so Evan and my wife were last to arrive. Everyone from his first grade class was there, already playing and screaming their heads off.\n\nI was so busy trying to get snacks set out that I almost didn’t notice him until it was too late. The Countdown Man was sitting at one of the picnic tables stonily watching the door. \n\n“Three, two, one,,” he said as trio of teenagers entered the arcade through the open double doors..\n\nThat’s when I saw my wife and Evan walking to entrance. My heart nearly stopped as I sprinted for the door, pushing the teenagers out of my way as I went barrelling forward. \n\n“Stop,” I was shouting. “Stop!”\n\nBut Evan only got more excited as he saw me. He started running for the door, running for daddy. As far and out of shape as I’ve gotten, I dug down deep and sprinted faster than I ever had before.\n\nI collided with Evan right on the threshold, tackling him to the ground. \n\nHe coughed, and I looked down at him, brushing the hair out of his face.\n\n“Talk to me,” I said. “Talk to me.”\n\n“What’s wrong, daddy?” he asked. “Are you okay?”\n\nThat’s when I heard the scream. \n\nI looked over my shoulder to see my mother leaning over my dad near the far entrance near the back of the building. She was calling his name and looking frantically around the arcade, calling for help. \n\nOf course, I already knew it was too late.\n\nThe Countdown Man looked sadly at my father and then walked over to me. For a second, he met my eyes, and then he put a hand on my shoulder. His touch felt like ice. \n\nHis eyes were trembling, and I could tell he wanted to tell me something, that he was desperate, even. But all he could say were numbers, orderly and deadly.\n\n“It okay,” I whispered. “I know it’s not your fault.”\n\nThen the man pulled his hand away and straightened his coat, walking sadly away. As he did, Evan watched him go.\n\n“Daddy,” he asked. “Who was [that man](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)?”",

        "text": "I was not a gamer and only got involved in all of this because of a girl.\n\nI was a retro nerd. I loved books and libraries. I had cut holes in the elbows of a tweed jacket I’d bought from a charity shop and sewed patches on them – badly. I wore glasses and would never ever get contact lenses.\n\nI didn’t really have friends but someone I knew once told me my bedroom was not a like a teenager’s should be. It was apparently more like somewhere a middle-aged person would live.\n\nMy room was tidy, with calming colours, two watercolours of ocean scenes, and all my books on the shelves were filed by author and had dust jackets, and I saw nothing wrong with any of that.\n\nI had a laptop of course but only used it for schoolwork and to read about my favourite authors. There was nothing personal on there, no dodgy internet searches. I didn’t even have a password. The only thing a hacker would get from my laptop was boredom.\n\nI planned on going to university to study English Literature and was then going to take out a bank loan and open a second-hand bookshop, where I would sit behind a counter and work on my novel in between serving customers.\n\nThat was my world, and my future, and it was all going along in a pedestrian way until Jane walked into my life.\n\nActually, replace walk, with: bulldoze, disrupt big style, totally smash to smithereens my happily dull routines.\n\nShe crossed my path, literally, as I was leaving the public library one afternoon.\n\nHer blond hair was in a ponytail and she was wearing a loose fitting dress that was a pastel colour I did not know the name of. She was engrossed in something on the screen of her mobile phone.\n\nAnd then she was gone.\n\nLeaving behind the faintest trace of a scent.\n\nI stood there tingling all over.\n\nWow. She was so beautiful. She was perfect.\n\nI don’t remember walking home but I do remember how I could not get past the first page of the book I had checked out of the library.\n\nMy thoughts kept drifting back to her.\n\nI did not know her name then. I did not know anything about her other than that my life now felt empty and pointless.\n\nI had a bad case of being in love.\n\nThis was a first for me and I had no idea what to do – apart from maybe hang around outside the library in the hope that I might see her again, and then…\n\nWhat?\n\nImpress her with my knowledge of classic science fiction books. Dazzle her with grammatical skills.\n\nIt was hopeless.\n\nBut I did it anyway.\n\nI stood there for hours. I walked up and down. I sat on a wall and stared into space.\n\nI was so worried I might miss her that I did not even read the book I had with me.\n\nIt was early evening and the library was closing when she finally appeared.\n\nShe was wearing a different dress and her hair hung loose over her shoulders, but she was still staring at her phone.\n\nMy heart started to beat way too fast and I could feel sweat trickling down my neck.\n\nShe had not noticed me and in a second would be past me. I would have missed my chance.\n\n“Hey,” I said.\n\nShe looked up. She seemed a bit startled, and suspicious of me.\n\nI needed to say something amazing.\n\nI went with, “Hey.” Again.\n\nNo, that was useless.\n\nSo, I said, “Sorry, I thought we were about to collide then.”\n\nWhich wasn’t true and I was starting to wish the ground would open up and swallow me.\n\nThen she laughed and said, “I’m so sorry. I did actually walk into a mannequin in a store the other day because I wasn’t watching where I was going because of the game.”\n\n“What game?” I managed to ask.\n\nShe tilted the screen of her phone so I could see it. A gruesome looking thing was kneeling over a body and appeared to be eating the contents of its broken open skull.\n\nIt was gross.\n\nDayglo green letters over the top of this scene said: Game Over.\n\nShe was looking at her screen as well and scrunched up her nose. “They got me” she said, then smiled at me.\n\nTrying not to faint from the rush of feelings this caused, I asked, “Who got you?”\n\n“The zombies. They roam the city driven by their insane need to eat human brains. You have to zap them to survive and build up your score. It’s low tech and cheesy and it’s my favourite thing in the whole world. Have you ever played it?”\n\nI had as much experience with gaming as I did with girls.\n\n“No,” I replied, desperately hoping that was not the end of this conversation.\n\nShe beamed at me and said, “You should. What’s your email? I’ll send you the link.”\n\nFor long seconds I tried to remember what my email was. It had my name in it. But I could not even remember my own name. Then it came back to me.\n\nI told her and she tapped her screen. “Ok, that should be with you now. Nice to meet you. Bye.”\n\nI raised my hand in a goodbye wave and was still standing there with my hand in the air after she was out of sight.\n\nI was more in love with her than ever.\n\nAnd now I knew her name.\n\nHer email address started with Jane followed by some numbers.\n\n“Jane,” I said to my phone. “That’s a beautiful name.”\n\nThe emails I usually received on it were about new books being published or junk but this one just had a link in it.\n\nAnd under that a letter:\n\n*J*.\n\nAnd below that an *x*.\n\nA kiss. She had sent me a kiss.\n\nI floated home, floated through to my room.\n\nI looked at the message again and again on my phone, then I opened up the email on my laptop so I could read it on a bigger screen.\n\nWithout really thinking about it, I clicked on the link.\n\nA street appeared. A crude version of an inner city. There was a lot of graffiti, smashed and boarded up windows, trash drifting by, and from somewhere out of sight a pulsing beat.\n\nA small box opened in the centre of the screen asking me to choose a character.\n\nThere was a gangster zapper, a streetwise slayer, and a pastor of pain. There were images above each character’s name. They all had scars and sneers and really needed to see a dentist.\n\nI chose streetwise slayer and was asked if I wanted one player or group mode.\n\nMy life was set permanently in one player mode so I automatically went to that, then thought: What if Jane is playing in group mode?\n\nI had to see.\n\nI went for group mode and five icons appeared at the top of the screen. My streetwise slayer was one of them, and there were three other equally rough looking male characters and one female looking character, called, Fear She.\n\nI was trying to think how to check if this was Jane when a zombie walked up to me and bit me in the face.\n\nAt least I think that was what happened.\n\nThe words Game Over appeared, confirming they had got me.\n\nA big fat zero then flashed up.\n\nMy debut score.\n\nIt was so annoying, and so stupid, but I did not hesitate to click yes when I was invited to play again.\n\nI got a bit further this time and spotted another non-zombie character zapping their way out of a shopping mall.\n\nI was watching them and wondering if it was one of the other players when two zombies grabbed me by the arms and bit in unison.\n\nI sighed and played again.\n\nAnd again.\n\nBefore I knew it, it was dark outside. My score had crept up to four and I was now being shown the scores of the other players.\n\nFear She was in second place. Someone called Master of Monsters was way out in the lead.\n\nI had no idea who they were but immediately I did not like them.\n\nSometime around midnight I fell asleep still sitting in front of my laptop.\n\nThankfully it was the weekend so I could sleep in. I almost went straight back to playing the game when I woke up but managed to drag myself away.\n\nI felt in need of some fresh air and views of something other than a grimy, gory street.\n\nThe streets in my home city are tree-lined and kind of dull. My feet were aching after a while, so I sat down on a bench.\n\nMy phone pinged with the message of an incoming email.\n\nMy heart soared when I saw it was from Jane.\n\nShe said she was hanging out in the park, if I wanted to head along.\n\nBeing in love went in an instance from being the miserable pits to being the most shiny wonderful thing.\n\nI just about managed not to run all the way to the park but I was still breathless with anticipation when I arrived.\n\nI could see Jane standing near the fountain.\n\nSomehow, she once again looked even more beautiful than last time.\n\nAnd I started to feel sick – because she was resting her hand on the arm of another boy and laughing as he spoke.\n\nI wanted to turn around and leave, but she had noticed me and waved.\n\nI trudged over. I actually felt close to tears. Being in love was horrible. It was a kind of torture.\n\nJane smiled her perfect smile and said, “This is Danny. You know him better as Master of Monsters.”\n\nHe turned to me and said, “You must be streetwise slayer, hey.”\n\nHe was maybe a couple of years older than me, and Jane. He looked relaxed and cool.\n\nAnd I hated him.\n\nI burnt with anger.\n\nAnd I put a smile on my face as Danny told a story about the possum in his neighbour’s garden that Jane thought was hilarious.\n\nI kept glancing at her, wishing that she had been looking at me like she looked at Danny.\n\nBut I did not think she ever would.\n\nI felt so low.\n\nThe sun was shining on everyone else but me.\n\nI gritted my teeth into a smile for as long as I could, then muttered something about needing to head off.\n\nDanny asked me where I lived then said he was heading the same way as me. “I can maybe give you a few tips about the game along the way, if you’d like?” he asked.\n\nThrough a grimace I said, “That would be great.”\n\nJane hugged him enthusiastically for what felt like a long time, then gave me a brief hug and set off in another direction. She was already staring at her phone, presumably playing the game.\n\nI hated the game now as well. Stupid zombies.\n\nDanny was telling me ways to win anyway, as he’d promised. How to stay alive and even get bonus points.\n\nEvery now and then I said listlessly, “Sounds amazing,” because I did not have the strength to tell him what I really felt.\n\nFinally, we reached an intersection where we would go our separate ways.\n\n“Been good getting to know you,” he said. “In the flesh. The juicy flesh that those pesky zombies just love to bite.”\n\nThen he grinned.\n\nIn a mad way, I hated myself more than I hated him at that moment in time.\n\nHe actually seemed like a genuinely good guy.\n\nBut I was too messed up about Jane to do anything but shrug and say, “Whatever,” then walk away.\n\nI wish I had said something thoughtful. Something nice, because that was the day Danny died.\n\nAs far as I could ever find out from a distance, the doctors were never fully certain about why he died. The closest they could get was a weakness in his heart. A condition that he must have been born with.\n\nI did not go the funeral. I was not family, not close in any way, but I grieved for a long time.\n\nTwo weeks after Danny was buried in the cemetery of a nearby church, I emailed Jane.\n\nI’m so sorry, I wrote. I can’t imagine how much you must be hurting, but I had an idea. Please feel free to tell me to get lost if you hate it, but maybe we could play one more game. You know, in memory of Danny. I wished I had got to know him better. He seemed like a really nice person.\n\nI knew trying to get closer to her at such an awful time would be a very low thing to do.\n\nI wasn’t.\n\nI was simply writing from the heart.\n\nWishing that death did not mean game over in the real world.\n\nWishing there was a chance to make things better.\n\nShe did not reply.\n\nI wasn’t surprised and guessed that was for the best.\n\nMy bedroom was feeling claustrophobic and far too hot even with the window open, so I decided to go for a long walk.\n\nI lost track of time and didn’t care where I was going. It was dark by the time I turned and set off back home.\n\nI was a couple of minutes away when an email pinged on my phone.\n\nIt was from Jane.\n\nI took a deep breath, opened it.\n\nHey, it read, Thank you for your sweet message. I think you’re right. It would be good to play the game one more time. I see you’ve already started without me – and streetwise slayer you’re on fire!! Zapping zombies like there’s no tomorrow.\n\nMy head began to spin. She thought my message was sweet and liked my idea about giving the game a final whirl. Which was amazing.\n\nBut I did not understand the rest.\n\nI had not gone online since emailing her. How could I be playing the game?\n\nThe house was in darkness as I let myself in. My dad was away on business and my mom sometimes doped up on sleeping tablets.\n\nFor once, I was fine about that.\n\nThe last thing I needed was a parental chat about how pale I was looking.\n\nAnd though I hadn’t looked in any mirrors, I felt pale. I was sweating and felt unsteady on my feet.\n\nMy guts were telling me that something was wrong,\n\nI opened the door to my bedroom and recoiled.\n\nThere was a nauseating smell. It smelt like something had gone off.\n\nI turned on the light and almost screamed.\n\nThere was a figure sitting in front of my laptop. On the screen, zombies were being zapped into oblivion.\n\nI could see the score for streetwise slayer spiralling.\n\nThen the figure turned and grinned at me.\n\nDanny’s lips were cracked. The skin around them was peeling away. Something was moving inside his mouth, wriggling.\n\nI watched in horror as a maggot crawled out.\n\n“Hey,” he said. His voice was hoarse. “I hope you don’t mind but I went online as you. Boy, I’ve missed this game.”\n\n“But, you’re…” I began to say.\n\n“Dead and buried, I know,\" he replied. “But something happened. Everything was dark and silent and then suddenly I could think again and move. And it took an age, but I managed to push the coffin lid aside and get out of the ground. I was going to go and see Jane but I did not want to freak her out, so I thought I’d pay you a visit. You know, hang out.”\n\nI stared at him. The suit he had been laid to rest in was torn in places. I could see deeper, darker cracks in his skin below. Through to muscle in one place and a hint of bone.\n\nI swallowed, trying very hard not to hurl. There was a zombie in my room, playing a zombie game.\n\n“Ok,” I said. I needed to keep it together just long enough to get help. “Be with you in a second,” I said and took out my phone.\n\nI began to key in 911 praying the police could get here quickly.\n\nDanny asked, “Are you getting pizza? Tell them to replace the anchovies with brains.”\n\nHis grin got wider.\n\nI hesitated over the final 1. He looked grotesque but whatever had happened to him, this was Danny.\n\nI owed him.\n\nI put my phone away.\n\nDanny’s attention had turned to his hands. He cursed and said, “Stupid rotting fingers. They’re just not working like they should.”\n\nMy voice caught in my throat as I said, “We can get you help. I’ll phone for an ambulance. They can take you to a hospital, the doctors will…”\n\nDanny spoke over me: “Look at me. They’ll lock me up, do tests on me. I don’t want to be a freak show.”\n\nHe looked sadly at the screen where the image was frozen around the words Game Over and got slowly to his feet.\n\nHe staggered slightly. Shrugged, said, “My balance is going as well as the fleshy bits in my legs.”\n\nThen he took a deep breath and said, “It’s no good. I need to do the right thing. I need to return to the grave.”\n\n“You can’t,” I pleaded.\n\n“It’s the only way,” he replied. “All of me is decaying. Including my brain. I can feel it. I keep forgetting things and sometimes I can’t think straight. And, sometimes, the things I think are really dark. I was only half-joking about the brain pizza.”\n\nHe kind of smiled when he said this, but this did nothing to hide the pain I could see he was in.\n\nHis body was breaking down and there was nothing he or anyone else could do about it.\n\nHe took another deep breath. “So, that’s how the cookie crumbles. Or…” another attempt at a smile passed over his face. “… that’s how the Danny crumbles, if we’re being brutally honest. And I can’t bear the idea of me hurting someone along the way, and that’s a very real possibility. Most likely, a slam dunk certainty. So, I have to return.”\n\nHe wiped away a tear and asked me if I would help him get back to his grave and, when he climbed back into his coffin, if I would secure the lid.\n\n“You need to make sure there’s no way I can escape again,” he said.\n\nI said yes. I did not feel there was anything else I could do.\n\nI found a hammer and a box of nails in the garage so I could secure the coffin lid in place. I finally vomited. Then we made our way through the dark, deserted streets and climbed over the gates into the cemetery. I stood there sobbing while Danny scrambled back down into his coffin.\n\nI did not think this could get any worse.\n\nBut it did.\n\nAs I started to move the coffin lid over him, Danny looked up at me with his decomposing eyes and said, “I’m scared.”\n\n*The portable game console is nothing fancy. There’s a couple of buttons on either side of a screen. The battery lasts an age and you don’t have to be online to use it.*\n\n*There are no zombies in the game I am playing on it. This game is set on a road circuit. It’s basically a case of getting round as fast as you can without crashing. I have been playing it every day.*\n\n*That was the promise I made.*\n\n*After Danny had told me he was scared I had an idea. I asked him to give me a little time and ran to an all-night store. I bought two portable games consoles, pre-loaded with the same selection of games, then hurried back to the cemetery. I gave one to Danny and asked him to choose the game.*\n\n*Our game.*\n\n*He chose the car race game, and I told him I would play it always and think of him.*\n\n*Then I did what he had asked me to. I made sure he would never be able to leave, by securing the coffin lid.*\n\n*I staggered home afterwards and cried myself to sleep.*\n\n*That was four weeks ago.*\n\n*My lap-times are getting shorter and my score has been rising.*\n\n*I hope Danny is still playing. I hope he is able to – though I know the changes to his body will eventually rob him of the ability to work the console.*\n\n*I can only hope that when that happens, the decay will take his thoughts soon after and allow him a kind of peace.*",

        "text": "I grew up in Scotland, a wonderful place for mythological creatures to roam, you may have grown up with some myths as well; my mam, grandmam and I, would sit around a fireplace as grandmam told her stories. My mam always told me it was important to listen to grandmam's stories, no matter how fantastical.\n\nWhen my little sister, a glowing young lassie named Lainey, was born, my grandmam told us about the kelpie. Its name literally meant \"waterhorse\".\n\n\"Arran, Lainey, the kelpie is especially dangerous because it can get to know you, it shows up in the form of a handsome young lad on the beach and gets to know you. Eventually, the kelpie grows bored of the land, and takes the form of a beautiful black horse.\" This part was especially creepy, because my family ran a small horse ranch, how many kelpies could live in our backyard without us knowing?   \n\"Then, it waits for the beautiful maiden, and when she climbs atop, her hands are stuck. And, the kelpie takes off, taking the maiden off into its sea palace, until she dies.\" \n\nI always wanted to protect Lainey from the creatures my grandmam's stories told, I was the older one; the wiser one. Lainey was merely a young girl.\n\nWe'd go to ponds holding chubby, small hands like cherubs and dance. \n\nGrowing up, I soon realized I was gay, and that too, protected me from the creatures. After all, most creatures didn't go for men. Nor, for men that liked men. I was safe, and I could protect Lainey from the creatures. (And regular boyfriends who were just douchebags.) My dating pool was small, but safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, when I was in my young twenties, I had gone to the beach. That was when I first met *him*. There was a beautiful man, he had flowing black hair and sea-green eyes, I felt hypnotized. I didn't walk over that time, but I did notice the kelp and seaweed stuck in his hair. It didn't strike me as that odd, that day. \n\nIt was about a year later when I met the man again, this time near the pier. His hair was clean this time, and his eyes seemed dull. When I asked why, he had replied sadly; \"Me and my girlfriend...broke up.\" I consoled him, and we quickly became friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was when I was twenty-four, we became more than friends; Muir told me that he wished to be more, and I agreed, I could see nothing wrong and there was plenty of chemistry. \n\nOn our fourth month of happy dating, my grandmam had made me agree for her to meet Muir, and so, that was how we had a family dinner.\n\nWhen we arrived, grandmam stared at Muir with judging eyes, and Lainey smiled and congratulated me, her fiance standing by her side.   \n\"And, thats how we messed up our fourth lasagna of the night.\" I told Lainey, our smiling faces almost identical. \n\n\"I can't believe you a*nd* Muir are bad cooks!\" Lainey laughed, her fiance smiling at her, he was a quiet sort. But, very nice and gentle. (And, not a douchebag.) \n\n\"We're not bad! The lasagna gods just hate us.\" I argued, a playful grin had been on my face. \n\n\"Sure.\" Drawled mam, \"You can't even get microwaves to work, Arran.\" \n\nI leaned over to Muir, \"Defend me, beloved.\"\n\nHe slung an arm over my shoulder, and said; \"Arran, you know its true. I'm the only one that can cook for shit.\" \n\nI faked a cry, \"I've been betrayed! Betrayed I tell you!\" \n\nThat was the last happy night with my family, I couldn't help but see how grandmam judged Muir so darkly, like he had killed her last horse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater that night, grandmam pulled me away before we left.   \n\"Arran, you're blinded by love. That man...he's not a man at all. He's a kelpie. Please, my grandson, leave him before its too late.\" My grandmam had begged. \n\n\"What? Grandmam! He's not a kelpie. He's just a fisherman.\" I argued, my arms crossed. I couldn't believe my grandmam would want to keep me away from my love, my beloved. \n\nIt was as if I was hypnotized, as if I couldn't see outside of Muir being the wonderful man I knew, usually I would always believe my grandmam; there was truth in \"respecting your elders\" for my grandmam held so much knowledge, and I held so much less.\n\nYet, I was blinded by that love I held.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told Muir about it later with a smile, telling him about how silly my grandmam was.   \n\"She thinks you're a kelpie, Muir!\" I had laughed, not noticing how my beloved's eyes grew dark. \n\nHe laughed with me.\n\nThe next day, when I went to fee the horses, I saw something in the distance. \n\nA beautiful stallion; pure black in colour, with a flowing mane that appeared curly. Like a friesian. \n\nI walked closer to the stallion, hands up, slow. The horse neighed, and I couldn't help but grin. And, as I pet that silky coat, it felt oddly sticky; I took no notice, hypnotized by the stallion's eyes. They looked oddly human. \n\nAnd, I climbed atop the stallion, the stallion let me with ease. And, with terror I realized that the stick coat wouldn't let my hands free. I tried to pull my hands away, pulling, pulling.\n\nIt didn't work, I screamed, trying to call for Muir, but I was leaning so far forward that when the horse began galloping I fell flat on the horse, and my face too, was stuck on that silky coat. I tried to pull away, terror gripping my body as I smelt the sea. \n\nI could do nothing, I'd heard stories of people cutting off fingers to get away, but I couldn't do anything. I had no scissors and was face first on the kelpie. The terror pulsing through my veins made it hard to think, but all I knew was that I was going to die. \n\nAnd I would never see my mam, my grandmam, or Lainey ever again. \n\nI tried to pull away again, the terror gripping deeply, pulsing through my every vein. But, it did nothing, the kelpies sticky fur kept my body on tight. I could do nothing.\n\nIt was the worst terror I'd ever felt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe kelpie quickly made it to the sea, and I could do nothing to stop it. Not even as the feel of the water surrounded me, the quick swim of the that beast made it so I was alive, and I wondered why it didn't just kill me already? Was it preparing for torture? To tear me apart? \n\nIt took only a few minutes to reach the kelpie's destination, a glistening palace.\n\nThat's where I currently am, hiding, hiding in a closet with a lock with Muir banging on the door, yelling that he'll remove every single lock until I've learned my lesson.\n\nI can only hope you all learn your lesson about the strange men and women at the beach, for kelpie have been known to be both. I just hope I've saved a few lives.",

        "text": "(Hey everyone! This is my first time posting. This is a little short story I wrote. my punctuation might be off I struggle with it. Any way I hope you enjoy!)\n\n\nI clawed at the ground as it dragged me away, dirt was trapped under my nails as I clawed and fought. I sobbed defeated, hopeless, no matter what I do it always finds me. Its claws dug into my ankle as it laughed at my suffering, it laughed knowing I was so close to giving up.\n“Please go away! Please! please! please!”\nMy cries were met with more laughter. It brought me closer and closer to the pit in the middle of the field. It told me how worthless and weak I was as we got closer and closer.\n\n “I am inevitable like the four seasons, day and night, yesterday, today, and tomorrow.” “You can’t escape.” It looked back at me, hate in its eyes and malice in its voice, it sounded demonic. This made me sob harder because I felt it was true, I was forever trapped in a vicious cycle of invisible suffering. I could see the pit now. Screaming came from within, its grip felt like a vice.\n\nIt almost began to skip it was anxious and giddy at the thought of me meeting my end. I wiggled, kicked and screamed until my voice was gone and I tasted copper. I felt the fingernail on my index finger break off from my fruitless effort to slow down my path closer and closer to a horrible fate. I could now see the edge of the pit. “NOOO! NOOO! PLEASE! I DON’T WANT TO DIE!” “Yes, you do!” It said with that demonic laugh.\n\nIt held my head over the pit, it almost seemed as it was starving for another victim. I fell forward into the pit but I managed to hold on to the edge with one hand. It hated that I still had fight in me, it leaned over the edge putting its face inches from mine. Saliva hit my face, its breath was hot and rancid. “You’re worthless.” “You’d be better off dead.” “You ruin everyone’s life.” “You don’t deserve love.” “You’re disgusting.” “Everyone is better than you.” “You’ll never amount to anything.” “You’ve wasted your life.” “I am the only one that can save you.” “Just give up and let me take control.” “You’ll feel better down there.” “All of your problems will be gone.”\n\nIt pointed down. It then began to lift my finger one by one, slowly causing me to lose my grip. In a last ditch effort I reached up with my remaining hand, shoving my thumb in its eye it howled in pain, it fell on its back wailing. I hastily pulled myself up. I bolted past the creature not sure where I was going. I looked back and I saw it getting up but it didn’t pursue me, it stood on the edge of the pit, facing me it smiled and waved, then it fell in. The pit closed being replaced by dirt and grass. I collapsed, once again sobbing overwhelmed by emotion. I knew it would be back, I just knew.",

We realized we were in the clear eight blocks away from the park, no sight nor sound of the hatters. \r\n\r\nWe took shelter in a bus stop, the grey, ghost like figures around us paying us no heed. With every hour in this place, the real world seemed farther away, less consequential. \r\n\r\n“Don’t suppose you know how to pick a lock? “ I say, breaking the silence. \r\n\r\n“A skill I’ve always wanted to pick up, but never knew anyone to teach me. “ the old-head replies. \r\n\r\n“Heard of a way of kicking the cuffs against cement, friend of mine was always going on about it. “ I offer, trying to start the ball rolling on a solution. \r\n\r\n“I’ve heard about that trick a few times. Even saw a guy try it once. \r\n\r\nDidn’t break the cuffs, but it did skin him from wrist to palm. Had a stroke from the pain I think, looked like it at least. “ The old man is dismissive, his tone sets me on edge. \r\n\r\n“Okay, then what do you fucking suggest? “ I spit. \r\n\r\n“First, I suggest calming the hell down. This problem isn’t complicated, it’s just labor intensive. Phrase my parole officer loved to use. \r\n\r\nWe find a hardware store, get a hacksaw, or an angle grinder if we can find one, and we cut the chain. It’s not gonna be fun, but it ain’t rocket science. “ Now that the danger is over I notice a collected edge to Rabbit. The guy might be a little prone to freaking out, but it’s caution, not cowardice. \r\n\r\nRabbit’s predictions ring true and his plan works. With 8 hours of work, and a few dozen hacksaw blades, we manage to free ourselves. \r\n\r\nI’ll leave out the part where I spike up, giving only the most casual of wipes to my grime and metal shaving encrusted arm, while rabbit takes shaky pulls off an object that is often titled “Glass flower holder” in shady corner stores. It’d kinda spoil the wholesome bonding vibe. \r\n\r\nAnd so began my first week, on the path, with rabbit. \r\n\r\nI had a lot of questions, about him, the path, the mountain, everything. And to be honest, a lot of them were pretty stupid, just me flailing around in the dark for something that would help me. \r\n\r\nEventually Rabbit summed things up in the most accurate way possible. \r\n\r\n“Kid, trying to make a game plan in this place is dumb as hell. \r\n\r\nIf it’s not some rule of nature not working, it’s some rule from here working against you. \r\n\r\nIf it’s not the lunatics trapped in here with us, it’s some creature sticking it’s hand out of a shadow. \r\n\r\nAnd if it’s none of the fucking above, it’s going to be some brand new hair-in-the-joint you Didn’t see coming. \r\n\r\nIt’s all about being adaptable. “\r\n\r\nI’m not going to give you a comprehensive list of every thing rabbit showed me in that first week. If you’re looking for some droning list of spooky rules, I’m sure you know where to find one. \r\n\r\nBut I will go over a few of the more important, or interesting elements of our situation. \r\n\r\nFirst, time is pretty stable on the path, but space is a whole different matter. Miles seem to sneak by, I realized this one night, walking along what started as the 401 highway in Ontario , after a night of stimulants and walking which wouldn’t have brought us even close to the next town I realized we were on the outskirts of the city of New York. \r\n\r\nSecond, some objects were from the path and others belonged to the real world. This doesn’t really matter much except for certain things , mainly food and water. After a while, eating or drinking anything other than items from the path ( Sorting them was a process of trial and error at best.) would lead to starvation, dehydration and more, esoteric consequences . \r\n\r\nAnd last, but certainly not least was the thing that brought me here in the first place. Drugs. \r\n\r\nWhen I first got into this shit storm, I thought it was going to be one massive life fucking bender where the pot of gold at the end of the organ failure rainbow was waking up in Shangri-La. \r\n\r\nShows how much I know. \r\n\r\nIt’s more like a tightrope walk of debauchery. If we use too little, we begin to fall off the path. \r\n\r\nHappened to me once when we were being followed by something long, feline and with a piss and butter reek to it that made my skin crawl and my heart hammer in my chest. \r\n\r\nDidn’t want to be distracted and I gritted my teeth through a day of the shakes to try and keep a clear head. It started with a feeling like a strong wind, but one that was blowing through me. And progressed into a sense of dissociation, of being spread so thin, in body, mind and soul that I  couldn’t exist. \r\n\r\nLuckily Rabbit was there with a rig and some life experience. \r\nToo much party fuel? Well… fucking drugs man. Can’t fight when you are on the nod, too much blow and you stop eating, track marks turn into sepsis, all that shit that makes being a waste of space unpleasant has lethal consequences here. \r\nAnd as far as drug supply? Every day some bag of powder, bottle of booze, or foil of tar shows up in a pocket, Rabbit’s backpack, or even just laying, untouched, on the street. Like the universe loves watching us destroy ourselves. \r\n\r\n\r\nRabbit and myself had been taking shelter in an old abandoned apartment building for a few days, New York was a good place to learn the ropes, and while we Didn’t actually have to worry about being found or kicked out of anywhere ( at this point civilians, people from the real world, were nothing more than barely visible ghosts.) trying to relax when you’re constantly being walked through is a hard thing to do. \r\n\r\nWe had a small fire, and the party favors for the evening were mason jars of an extremely hard liquor neither of us recognized, and a sandwich bag full of some kind of benzo ( Fucked if I know which one, I’m a junkie not a pharmacist, and besides, I’m not writing the jolly Roger cookbook for stoners. This shit kills you, avoid it.) \r\n\r\nEarlier in the night I  asked Rabbit what brought him to the path, why he wanted to get into the mountain, and after a few days with the old guy, his answer shocked me. \r\n\r\n“I did something awful. No excuse, no justification. The type of thing that in any kind of a just universe would be a one way ticket to hell. \r\n\r\nI know I deserve it, but what can I say, I’m a coward. And if you make it to the mountain, it voids your expiry date. You play by the rules there you don’t have to see what’s on the other side of life and death. “\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, I pried, tact isn’t my strong suit. And the old-head told me, no I won’t tell you. \r\n\r\nNot because I think you can’t handle it, shit, if you are reading this, you are the type of person to seek out the most brutal things you can find. \r\n\r\nAnd not because I want to protect rabbit. For what it’s worth I agree with him. \r\n\r\nIt’s because I want you to understand how bleak my situation is, if only in a tiny way. \r\n\r\nI want you to feel what it’s like to have to grab on to any piece of wreckage just to avoid drowning. \r\n\r\nSo don’t worry about what he did, he could be the worst person in the universe, but sometimes you have to let someone’s history start the moment they meet you. \r\n\r\nThe mood was dark, and I tried to lighten it as much as I could. \r\n\r\n“Okay, so, elephant in the room. \r\n\r\nWhat is with the Alice in wonderland bullshit? “ I say \r\n\r\nRabbit laughs and shakes his head. \r\n\r\n“Wondering when you’d ask that, pun completely fucking intended. “ Rabbit raises his jar of not quite clear booze for a toast, I oblige, “\r\n\r\nIt's just that, bullshit. \r\n\r\nHell from what I hear hasn’t even always been Alice in Wonderland.\r\n\r\nC. S. Lewis characters before that, Tolkien before that, you get it. \r\n\r\nHappens back in the real world too. I remember back in the early 90’s every guy who thought he was a Scary mother fucker called himself ‘Freddy Krueger ‘, if you asked why, he’d say something about how he collected his debts when people were sleeping. Just some stupid barely connected reason to have a spooky nickname. \r\n\r\nPeople want  to be scarier than they are, but 99% of them don’t want to put any effort into things. So they find something everyone knows, slap a cheap coat of paint on it and try and claim it. “\r\n\r\nRabbit looks like he has more to say on the subject, but we both go silent as we hear it. \r\n\r\nThe tapping seems random at first, gaining volume as whatever is making it gets closer. \r\n\r\n“Is that… “ I say as I recognise the tune.\r\n\r\nThe voice screaming the words is full of bass and rage, so loud it damn near shakes the thin tenement walls. \r\n\r\n**One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small… **\r\n\r\nMy heart begins to pound, I have a sinking, nauseous feeling in the pit of my stomach that has nothing to do with the mystery booze we’ve been pounding back. \r\n\r\nOf course, I’m the first to stick my head out. \r\n\r\n**And the ones that mother gives you, don’t do anything at all… **\r\n\r\n“It’s fucking him. “ I I growl at rabbit, my voice a low whisper. \r\n\r\n“What do you think he wants? “ rabbit says, fumbling around a pocket and producing a two barrel derringer so small I think it has to be a model or cigarette lighter. \r\n\r\n“Considering he is wearing a God damned costume, nothing good. “ the tension in my voice is obvious, fight or flight makes me shake, demanding I make any decision other than just standing here. \r\n\r\nThe night is late and the hallway is dark, but just to be an asshole about things the full moon backlights The Sadhatter through glassless windows, showcasing him as the avatar of dementia he seems to be. \r\n\r\nHis costume is Buster Keaton by way of home depot. Telling a story only obvious to rabbit and myself. \r\n\r\nHe took the clothing of the hatter’s he’d killed and using whatever was available, (by  the looks of it mostly thin metal wire and rusted industrial staples) fashioned it into something that seemed just as much of a weapon as the black steel cane he tapped against the wall. \r\n\r\nThe bent and mottled top had seemed to be adhered to his head, not moving an inch as he stalked down the hallway. \r\n\r\nIf I said he painted his face, you’d picture some kind of smeared clown warpaint. But this guy wasn’t some Juggalo, he used what appeared to be engine grease to create intricate, overlapping shapes and swirls on his egg shell white skin, lines clean, points looking as sharp as the homemade knife hanging from his belt. \r\n\r\nHis overcoat was studded with small nails, overlapping layers of cloth and leather that dragged, fraying on the floor, slaves stained with crimson and grime. \r\n\r\nThis man was death, he was fear, he was a walking weapon that we left for dead. \r\n\r\nRabbit is running down the hallway a full second before he looks back and screams “Run! “, I’d be angry, but my mind has no focus other than getting away from this slasher villain We’ve pissed off. \r\n\r\n**And if you go chasing rabbits, and know your gonna fall… **\r\n\r\nThe Sadhatter’s tone is manic, almost joyful in a sick way. He makes this ancient lyric seem like a personal threat, spurning Rabbit and myself faster down the hallway. \r\n\r\nAs I see rabbit fall forward, I realize this was part of his plan. \r\n\r\nI hop over the trip wire, losing my balance, I stumble, letting my momentum carry me into the wall at the end of the hallway, intending to use it to stop myself and sprint toward the stairwell. \r\n\r\nA dozen bursts  of pain light up my left side, as I rip myself from the wall, I see the dozens of sowing needles, nearly invisible jammed into the wall, a good portion of them now dripping with my blood. \r\n\r\nI realize this means The Sadhatter must have been in here with us for a long time. Completely unnoticed. \r\n\r\nRabbit’s eyes are wild, I see the web of fishing line and metal scrap in the door of the stairwell before he does, but my shouting does no good, drowned out by the maniac chanting of killer hunting us. Rabbit hits it at full speed, becoming hopelessly tangled in an instant. \r\n\r\nThe Sadhatter points his mace like cane at me. \r\n\r\n**Tell them a hookah smoking caterpillar, has given you the call… **\r\n\r\nHis grin, that fang toothed, bloodletting grin makes my next decision for me. \r\n\r\nI duck low and cover my face, running into rabbit with every bit of force I can muster with a body  practically crumbling from abuse. \r\n\r\nBut it’s enough, the line snaps, and we hit the ground in a tangled sprawling mess. Bleeding, and bruised, but alive. \r\n\r\n“We need to hide. “ rabbit whispers, practically leaping down the flight of stairs to the next floor. \r\n\r\nI don’t disagree. There is no knowing how long this guy has been here with us, and no way to know how many more surprises he’s set up. \r\n\r\nWe can’t fight him, we can’t outpace him, the only option is to try and wait him out., Hope finds some other slight or shiny object to fixate on. \r\n\r\nIt's not a plan with much hope, which seems par for the course on the path. \r\n\r\nWe slink through the hallway, trying doors until one finally swings open. \r\n\r\nThe furniture is sparse and rotted, useless for barring the door. He creep to the furthest bedroom, slowly closing the crumbling plywood door. \r\n\r\nThe building is silent, dust and mold floats down like January snow, catching the moonlight. \r\n\r\nTerror is wondering what is going to happen, horror is when it does. \r\n\r\nRabbit and myself are terrified as we crouch down, trying to listen tor any sign of this not-quite-clown we have been cursed with. \r\n\r\nWe are both overcame with horror as one of the thin drywall walls explodes, The Sadhatter bursting between two studs to stand looming in the small room, in the midst of a swirling vortex of drywall and asbestos. \r\n\r\nI’ve lost all sense, I fall to my back and scramble backwards to the far corner of the room, trying anything, no matter how futile to get away from this monster. \r\n\r\nRabbit is screaming, , waving his peashooter in the general direction of The Sadhatter and myself. His hand shaking so badly he’s just as likely to hit the ceiling. \r\n\r\nI try to stand, but this Impending Doom of a person drops to his knees, face inches from mine. \r\n\r\nI see deep gin blossoms in his crimson painted nose, bloodshot eyes run wild with anticipation and hatred. His breath is an astringent fog of alcohol and spoiled food, I feel death close in as he begins to speak. \r\n\r\n“An alcoholic and two worthless fucking junkies walk into purgatory. \r\n\r\nKnow what this joke is missing, Kev? “ \r\n\r\nThe Sadhatter let’s this hang for a moment, before moving even closer. \r\n\r\n“A punchline. “\r\n\r\nThe first blow is hard enough to put my head two inches into the drywall behind me. It’d have turned my nose to pulp had there been a stud behind my head. \r\n\r\nThe rest come in a five second wave of violence so painful and overwhelming I wouldn’t know where to begin in describing it. I’m left on my side, vainly trying to cover my face, blood pouring from my nose and lips, everything from my ribs to my nuts aching and bruised. \r\n\r\nI try to calm myself, I know this is it, there is nothing I can do about my situation. I wait for the blow that splits open my skull, or spills my guts to the floor. \r\n\r\nBut it doesn’t come, what does is a small, almost gentle kick in the stomach. \r\n\r\n“So, I’m pretty much done, you can get up if you want. “ The Sadhatter says, his tone casual. Somehow this emotional turn on a dime scares me even further. \r\n\r\nI spit out a tooth, getting to my knees. I keep expecting a knife in the stomach as I slowly stand, but it never comes. \r\n\r\nThe Sadhatter pulls out a dirty white handkerchief and starts to wipe the blood from his hands, Rabbit is still mumbling threats and waving his gun. \r\n\r\n“You always leave someone for dead when they save your life? “ The clown says.\r\n\r\n“We were in handcuffs man. “ I say, showing him the metal bracelets still attached to our wrists. “We only managed to get the chains cut a day later. “\r\n\r\nRabbit goes silent, cocking back the toy-like hammer of the miniature pistol.\r\n\r\n“And what do you think I was doing when I was rummaging through the pockets of those edgy little shit heads? Finding the  keys Kev. \r\n\r\nAnd Rabbit, I replaced the cartridges in that pellet gun with Good N’ Plenties last night, you two sleep like the fucking dead.” There is no mistaking the warning in the killer’s tone. \r\n\r\nMaybe it was panic, maybe it was stupidity, but rabbit pulls the trigger. \r\n\r\nTwo muffled clicks show our tormentor to be telling the truth. \r\n\r\nHis face goes dark and he spins around in an instant, he grabs rabbit with his left hand and holds his lethal looking cane poised to strike in his right. \r\n\r\n“I hate someone who doesn’t understand an eye for an eye. \r\n\r\nMy buddy Kev here, he got me fucked up, so I fucked up him up.  Now it’s over. Now, we get along just God damned great! Don’t we Kev? \r\n\r\nYou though, you seem like the kind of slimy little fucker that never forgets a punch in the face, am I right? \r\n\r\nYou hold on to that shit, you let it stew, you’d never forget the ass kicking that’d make us even, and one night I’d find myself with one of those tiny bullets in the back of my skull. \r\n\r\nSo what do I do Rabbit? \r\n\r\nCards on the table, you two seem like the most trustworthy of the scumbags around here. So killing you is kind of a waste. \r\n\r\nFun, but a waste. \r\n\r\nI could take your hands, you’d probably survive, but It’d be a pain in the ass down the road. \r\n\r\nOr, you could understand something. \r\n\r\nIf you hesitate for a moment to help me, if you question one order, if I see one look I think means trouble, I don’t just kill you, I turn you into a goddamn totem. \r\n\r\nI take you apart, and I do my level best to keep you alive when I rearrange the pieces, and display you like a fucking Christmas tree. With the way things are around here, the clout that’d give me, probably worth more than whatever you have to offer anyway. “\r\n\r\nI’m silent but internally I’m screaming at rabbit to lower the gun, to give this fucking madman the submission he wants. \r\n\r\nThe old head is a survivor, he puts away the useless weapon, and nods to the Urban Legend who holds his life in his hand. \r\n\r\nWith a flick of his wrist The Sadhatter embeds his cane into one of the rooms mold ridden walls. \r\n\r\nHis grin seems genuine now, despite being robbed of none of it’s danger. He holds out his hands, still blood damp, “The name’s Mike by the way, this whole ‘Sadhatter’ Thing, it’s to rile up the edgelords out there. \r\n\r\nFuck me, I hate  Manson, I really do, but the little hobbit got one thing right. You have to be a little witchy when you kill, or no one takes notice. “\r\n\r\nAnd with that, we were saddled with a psychopath. A dangerous hanger on who we didn’t dare try and escape. \r\n\r\nI try to see some kind of silver lining to this situation, to see Mike as some type of bodyguard, or mercenary, but he isn’t. He’s no Ronin at our beckon call, he’s a curse we brought upon ourselves. \r\n\r\nI’d call him a monster, but we met our first true monster walking down a vacant city street none of us recognised. \r\n\r\n“But how does that explain how I got here, trust me, when I get wasted it’s not with the intent to end up in a fucking German art film. “ Mike says to Rabbit. \r\n\r\n“I don’t know everything Mike, I pick up bits here and there, and I give them a pass through the old bullshit detector. \r\n\r\nI’m sure there are more ways to get on the path, but I sure as hell don’t know anything about them. “ Rabbit replies. \r\n\r\nThe three of us stop, smelling something none of us have inhaled in a long time, tobacco. \r\n\r\nFor all of the hard drugs, all of the eighty proof booze, I haven’t seen one pack of smokes. Every store is bare, not so much as a stray butt on the street. \r\n\r\nThe smell of the one vice that seems forbidden to us takes our focus to a small alley, nothing more than a ten foot deep cubby between black windowed buildings. \r\n\r\nAt first he seems no more strange than any of the other soul crushed wanderers we have found on the path. \r\n\r\nSix feet tall, wearing a long brown trench coat that would seem at home in any film noir. The figure is bent over a garbage can, cigarette hanging from it’s puckered toothless mouth, a strange light coming from within the refuse bin. \r\n\r\n“We need to go. All I know about those things is that they steal kids from the real world for God knows what, can’t be hurt, and don’t take kindly to people who distract them. “ Rabbit says in a whisper, already looking around for a clear exit. \r\n\r\nMike rolls his eyes, “ Jesus rabbit do I have to do everything myself? “, he says before turning away from us and closing his eyes. \r\n\r\nThe killer stands, silently for a moment, when he opens his eyes he is clearly seeing someone Rabbit and I aren’t. \r\n\r\n“Okay, so you’re saying the chances are about 50/50? \r\n\r\nWhatever, I want that coat. “ I don’t like the implications of Mike’s one sided conversation. \r\n\r\n“Who was that? “ I ask Mike. \r\n\r\nThe man starts a beeline toward the thing in the trench coat, talking as he goes. \r\n\r\n“Either the ghost of Jack The Ripper, or a random voice in my head. Take your pick. Either way, he’s right most of the time. “ The fixated lunatic replies, offering no further justification. \r\n\r\nRabbit and I look to each other, we have a conversation without saying a word. \r\n\r\nWe don’t think the killer is going to survive, but we’re also scared shitless of the consequences of running if he does. \r\n\r\nThere are sounds coming from within the garbage can, things none of us have heard in a long time. The laughter of children. \r\n\r\nIt raises a hand over the portal, a whip thin skeletal limb, no muscle, no fat, nothing but bone and skin. It’s fingers twitching with greed it reaches down. \r\n\r\n“Hey fuck face! “ Mike screams, hurling his cane end over end at the creature. \r\n\r\nIt faces us and any thought I had about it being human was proven wrong. \r\n\r\nIt has no eyes, it’s mouth a puckered sphincter lined with thin quill like teeth. \r\n\r\nIt’s a skeleton, covered in loose fitting flapping flesh, as I look closer I can see the coat is part of the thing, twitching and rippling like a bat wing. \r\n\r\nThe cane hits the thing, but thuds harmlessly into it’s hanging folds of Ill fitting skin. \r\n\r\nMike is still charging head on as the entity begins to take in a giant, heaving breath, and in a moment, all three of us are stopped cold. \r\n\r\nLater I’d find out the thing was taking years from our life. It’s how they feed, and why they prefer to pick kids, more life to take. \r\n\r\nWe can’t breathe, we can barely stand, the creature advances on Mike, still inhaling, still taking some ethereal thing from us  none of us even knew we had. \r\n\r\nMike is in motion as the creature starts to open its mouth, skin splitting and tearing, dripping grey blood. The thing is taken off guard as Mike grabs it’s thin wrists. \r\n\r\nThat feeling of being drained relents, and Rabbit and myself are left coughing and trying to collect our thoughts. \r\n\r\nThe creature is strong, Mike falters within a few seconds, arms shaking with the effort of restraining the creature. \r\n\r\n“Little help boys! “ he screams at us. \r\n\r\nIt’s no sense of friendship that drives us forward, no, it’s pure coercion. To even call our relationship with Mike transactional, would be a massive overstatement. \r\n\r\nI slam into the things right leg, it’s no thicker than a broomstick, but  barely moves an inch. I dig my heels in, grabbing handfuls of skin and pushing with all my might, not even sure of the plan. \r\n\r\nRabbit gets around the thing, looping his ancient leather belt around it’s neck. \r\n\r\n“No gas to siphon in my tank is there, ass-lips? “ Mike screams into the creatures face. \r\n\r\nIt’s ungodly strong, but as rabbit leverages himself, climbing the thing, using the belt to hang off the ground, it falls. \r\n\r\nWe all take some cuts and bruises as we hit the ground, the creature begins to thrash and fight, but it can’t get leverage. \r\n\r\nMike mounts the thing with the grace of a professional fighter, rabbit and I, cut, bleeding, and spending every ounce of our strength to help keep the thing pinned. \r\n\r\n“We can’t hurt you, but we don’t need to, do we? \r\n\r\nA little birdie told me that you need to do your little penny wise thing every couple of days, is that true? \r\n\r\nWell, you might as well get comfy, because we have no where to fucking go, and right now, you don’t seem to be able to do shit about us. “ Mike’s tone is a weapon in and of itself, mocking the creature, enraging it. \r\n\r\nI wish I felt as confidant about our ability to keep this thing here as he did. I can feel deep cramps in my thighs, and inch by inch my grip is slipping. \r\n\r\nThe thing laughs, a Hollow haunting noise, then there is darkness. \r\n\r\nI come to for a moment, flying through the air, then again, crumpled against a wall, rabbit motionless beside me. \r\n\r\nMy vision fades in and out, the ground around me is soaked with something, not quite blood, but close. \r\n\r\nThe first thing I notice is the creature. \r\n\r\nIt stands twelve feet tall, a massive, black boned horror, it now resembles a hellish combination of stick bug and streetlamp, wicked pointed limbs protruding from it at random angles, it swings it’s spotlight of a face toward me. \r\n\r\nI see Mike as a shadow, standing on the top of a building. He shrugs at me, “I tried, you guys are on your own. “  with a tip of his hat, and a grin that makes me want to break him in half despite my inability, he fades into the night. \r\n\r\nI hear the thing behind me take slow lumbering steps as I try to wake Rabbit. \r\n\r\nIt’s no use, he’s out cold, or maybe dead. But the thing is, as much of a piece of shit as I am, I’m not that heartless piece of shit on the roof. \r\n\r\nI get his limp body over one shoulder and start to hobble toward a thin alley, tuning out the sound of certain death behind me.",

        "text": " \n\nI don't know how long I've been here, or even where here is. I only have rough idea of when I came here, but I know that it was around a year ago. And I'm stuck here, even now.  \nThis place is meant to be some kind of forest, but it's dead, sick, and dying all in one. The trees are black and twisted, mutated in the darkness that hangs in the air here. The shrubs by the side of what barely qualifies as a path are dead; silently screaming out at me for death they will never be able to receive, tortured all the while. It’s meant to me night here, a full moon in the sky, but the branches of the trees slink around above me, greedily swallowing up any moonlight for me to see by. My eyes are accustomed to the darkness now.  \nAt my ankles, roots squirm and try to trip me up, drag me down to their level, where they can hurt me.The air itself whispers horrible things to me. Some lies; some true. All cause me pain. The lower branches of the trees lash out at me, cutting my arms, feasting on the blood. They're covered in scars now.  \nI know where I'm going. I know where this path is leading me. I don't want to go there; at the same time I do. I can't make up my mind. That's one of the reasons I'm here. I looked for help with them. I felt bad though, all of my friends became pestered by my questions. It didn't matter what they said, I knew it anyway. They just wanted me gone. I am now.  \nI lost all my friends. I left them; I did them a favour. They didn't like me anyway. They hated me, I don't blame them. I hate me too. I gave up trying to get help because I knew I would only make things worse. I didn't tell them. I just wore jumpers, or hoodie, or long sleeved shirts. They never questioned it. They didn't think twice about it. Maybe they do now.  \nThe path keeps leading me on and on, deeper into this forest. I can even start to see the fork in the path, the next decision I will have to make. The only one I will ever get right. I've thought about it for ages. I didn't know what I'd do. I know now.  \n\\*\"Are you okay, mate\" David asks me, worry in his voice.\\*  \n\\*I turn back and look at him. I was going to.the.bathroom, but he'd get suspicious if I didn't come back out, \"Yeah. I'm fine.\"\\*  \n\\*I'm not fine, but I will be.\\*  \n\\*He.sighs, knowing I won't say any more, \"Alex, you can always talk to me. You know that, right?\"\\*  \n\\*I nod, but I lie. I can't talk to him. He'll hate me too. I turn around and walk into my room.\\*  \nI finally reached the fork in the road. I look at the two different paths. On the left, it's much shorter. It ends in a thick, grey wall of fog. I don't know what's after that, but I can guess. The right path is far longer. Far more painful. But I can see the end. Beyond the forest, I can see verdant green fields. I can see a picturesque sky, with perfect fluffy clouds. I'm not swayed though. It ends now.  \n\\*I'm sitting on my bed. I almost can't comprehend what just happened. I feel faint and fall off my bed with a thump. I hear David jump up and start banging on the door, \"Alex! Damn it, Alex, talk [to me](http://to.me/)! Please!\"\\*  \nAs I walk into the fog, I place an arm out in front of me first. I feel a strong stinging sensation on my wrist. As I walk in completely, the stinging now becomes utter pain. It hurts so much that I nearly black out. I keep walking though. Nothing can stop me now.  \n\\*David busts the door open, tears streaming down his face. \"I won't let you do this!\"\\*  \n\\*Crying, he calls for an ambulance and tells them our address. \"Hurry, they're bleeding out!\"\\*  \n\\*Then everything goes black.\\*  \nI feel a great force disperse the fog, leaving me in the forest, yet again. I cry. I was so close to finally leaving. So damn close! I try to control my breathing. Calm down. I'll try again soon. I want this to happen. I'm ready now.  \n\\*The beeps from the hospital machine ring in my ears, each one mocking my failed attempt. I won't fail next time.\\*  \n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\\*After several days, David finally leaves the house, unwillingly. If he doesn't, he gets fired. I promise him I'll be fine. I lie. As soon as he's gone, I run to the bathroom and open the medicine cabinet. I'm sorry.\\*  \nI walk, once more into the fog. Nothing stops me this time. But, as I do so, I'm made aware of why I shouldn't do this. I'm sorry. There's no way back now.  \n\\*I write this now. It’s the last thing I'll ever do. Goodbye.\\*  \nGoodbye...",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I'm new and this is my first story. It's a true one about something that haunts me. \n\n I was raised Mormon. Those who know will know. I first felt the symptoms of depression when I was in Jr. High. The religion led to me rationalizing this as a spiritual failure. If I felt bad, it must mean that I was bad. Like I said, those who were raised in that will know what I mean. This was all reinforced by my bishop, who said that I needed to pray more, read my scriptures, and open myself up more to the love of Jesus. Big surprise, it wasn't working and I was mentally deteriorating. My bishop said that serving a mission would change everything for me. It was a cultural expectation, actually, that all young men serve missions. I felt like this truly was the thing I needed to do to fix whatever was broken inside of me.\n\nI was called to Lubbock Texas. Not fabulous, I know. The mission didn't fix anything, so I doubled down harder. I would stay up all night reading scriptures, babbling prayers. I went entirely, completely, Tyler Durden manic. My mission companion said I did a bunch of strange things. I put my shoes in the freezer. I would walk backwards. I would sometimes speak in tongues. My companion told me because I don't remember any of it. Apparantly, I had a seizure. I hit my head on a curb and suffered a traumatic brain injury. I was in a coma for 2 weeks. The church sent me home, and I have permanent brain damage to this day.\n\nWhen I came home, I found out my parents had gotten divorced. They had been planning it for a long time and were just waiting for me to leave to do it. My dad was nowhere to be found. My mom refused to accept that I had come home from my mission early. She called me the anti-christ and told me that if I wouldn't go back on my mission, I would have to leave and figure things out on my own. (I have a whole poem about that, you can ask in the comments if you want it.)\n\nI was homeless, mentally ill, and physically ill from the brain damage. I had a limp, and I was dizzy all the time. I had several failed suicide attempts, and I was pawning off what few belongings I had for food. \n\nI didn't know this back then, when I wandered the streets in winter, psychologically mangled. There was an arcade not far from where I went to high school. It was called the Atomic Arcade. It had tons of vintage arcade games and rare cabinets. It was operated by just 1 guy and there weren't any attendants. He was too lazy to close it at night so it was always open. He would come by every other day in the afternoon to collect the quarters. He never bothered me, even though I would loiter there to stay warm. I think I was kind of a scarecrow for him. Teenagers would go there to drink and they would be rough with the machines, but they were hesitant to do it when I was there, watching.\n\nAccross from the stool I would sit on, there was a Galaga cabinet. An original one from. The 80's. That meant it still had the old PSA's. \"winners don't do drugs\" and \"FBI warning.\" Once in a while, a face would pop up on screen. A missing child ad. The kid looked familiar, but that would have been impossible. The kid went missing before I was born. I would stand in front of that Galaga cabinet and wait for the ad to pop up. In the brief moments it was on screen, I would try to memorize the kids face. I would try to imagine the kid as an adult, trying to place where I had seen them. The ad was from 1985, so I did the math and calculated that the kid would have been in his late 20's. I would do this for hours, for days, trying to figure out where I knew this kid from. \n\nOne day, I came to the arcade and the Galaga machine was out of order and unplugged. I stared at the black CRT screen and I realized that I couldn't recognize myself. The person looking back at me was a complete stranger. He copied my movements like a reflection, but it wasn't me. I wondered if homelessness had changed me so much that I couldn't recognize myself. I looked homeless, my hair haphazardly cut with a pocket knife and scraggly beard. It was my eyes though. I didn't recognize my own eyes. They were dark, sunken, too old for my age. I felt sick. I knew the owner probably wouldn't like it, but I plugged the machine back in. I had a horrible feeling about the missing kid's face and this strange sensation of not recognizing myself. The screen flashed and Galaga began cycling through its sounds and animations. \n\nI waited, and the missing child ad popped up. A face I was familiar with, rather than my own estranged features. I realized that the missing kids face, looked like me as a child. I was the missing kid, but that wouldn't be possible. I was born in the 90's. The kid was probably born in the 70's. I felt like the ghost of this kid. The adult he could have become. Lost in machines and lights and sounds, never heard from again, but still haunting this place. I wonder if I had died back on my mission or countless other times and I had become a ghost, haunting the city, the arcade. Maybe me and the kid switched places. He served his mission, got married in the Mormon temple, had kids, served as a young men's leader. I went missing and he was found. I believed I was dead or a ghost for days. It's called Cotard's syndrome, apparantly. \n\nI was eventually able to get a job and I found a cheap slum house to live in. I slowly put my life back together, got into therapy. I would find out that the brain damage from the accident had caused something called Prosopagnosia (face blindness. That's another poem) essentially, I lost my ability to recognize complex shapes. They just don't get stored in my memory. For a long time, I thought I was just an asshole, but my brain was just broken. It's a rare condition. Some people are born with it, some aquire it from brain damage. Thing is, I remember some faces from before my accident. I just can't store any new faces in my memory. I still remember what I looked like as a kid, but I can't recognize myself today. I still get spooked by my own reflection, it feels like a stranger is looking at me. Whenever I wanted to die though, I would go back to the Atomic Arcade with a $20 and play games all night. It was a place I could go where I didn't feel alive. Me and that missing kid on the screen, left ghosts there. I could spend a night as that ghost. As of today, the arcade is gone. Closed during the pandemic. Still, I remember my own face in the machine. Part of me is still there, in the static.",

        "text": "Under the guise of slumber, my nights have been hijacked by terror. I, who have always been a lover of sleep, now find myself ensnared in a realm of darkness each time I am too tired to keep my eyes open. The ominous whispers and footsteps that once lingered just beyond my grasp have given way to apparitions, with visages twisted and devoid of all but inky marbles for eyes. These entities watch me as I lie paralyzed in my bed, powerless to resist their hold or to cry out for aid. This paralysis has seized control of my nights, and I am incapacitated against its grip.\n\nMy existence has become a mire of dreary repetition, each day a lackluster facsimile of the last. My employment, a soul-crushing drudgery, leaves me feeling bereft and isolated. The hours blend together in a monotonous fugue, indistinguishable from one another.\n\nIn my desperation for escape, I've taken to indulging in phantasmagorical daydreams, conjuring up visions of a life brimming with happiness and purpose. Yet, these reveries are inevitably shattered by the bleak truth of my reality.\n\nThe insanity that lurks at the periphery of my mind, like a maelstrom waiting to swallow me whole, whispers seductively, tempting me to surrender to the darkness. I fear that eventually, I will succumb to its lure, and all that will remain will be a hollowed-out husk of the man I once was. Until then, I soldier on, trudging through the muck and mire, in search of a glimmer of hope amidst the oppressive gloom.\n\nInitially, I believed the terrors of sleep paralysis to be a mere figment of the nocturnal hours. Yet, it wasn't long before these phantoms began to infiltrate my waking moments, as well. Twisted visages would peer at me from the corners of my vision, whispers in the wind echoing with malevolent intent. My mind was forever on edge, never sure when the next onslaught would come.\n\nI attempted to rationalize these apparitions as mere imagination run amok, but the hallucinations persisted with an unrelenting fervor. My once-banal life was now pervaded by fear, and I felt my grip on sanity slowly slipping away.\n\nIn a fit of desperation, I confided in a trusted associate, but they dismissed my tale as nothing more than stress-induced fancifulness. They believed a change of scenery would serve as the panacea for my troubles, but I knew that no respite could assuage the demons that haunted me.\n\nI am being gradually consumed by the monsters of my subconscious mind, and I fear that I will never be able to shake their grasp. The boundary between reality and nightmare is becoming increasingly blurred, and I dread that I will soon be lost to the darkness forever.\n\nIn a state of slumber not too long ago, I encountered a figure that would shape the course of my existence. As I lay immobile, captive to the grip of the night, a being emerged before me, its visage shrouded in shadows. It introduced itself as Hara, a demon that had been observing me from the beyond.\n\nWith a voice both seductive and menacing, Hara proclaimed that I was unique, a singular connection to the realm of sleep, where only in slumber would I find solace and true happiness. The demon offered to guide me to this world, a place to repose from the fear and the pain of the waking world. Hara promised me eternal peace, a release from my suffering.\n\nAs I gazed into the depths of Hara's obsidian eyes, a feeling of unease crept over me. The demon's words echoed within my mind, promising eternal rest and happiness, but I could not shake the nagging suspicion that something was amiss. I mustered the courage to ask Hara, my voice steady but wary, \"Pray tell, what exactly is this 'eternal sleep' you speak of? Is it truly the blissful repose you claim it to be?\"\n\nHara's lips curled into a sly smile, revealing razor sharp teeth. \"Ah, my dear John, eternal sleep is a state of being beyond the comprehension of mortal men. It is a dreamless slumber where all fears, worries and pain are forgotten. A place where time stands still, and one is bathed in an eternal light of peace.\" The demon's words were alluring, but I could not ignore the undercurrent of malevolence that lay just beneath the surface.\n\n\"And what of the cost of such slumber?\" I asked, my voice trembling. \"What must I sacrifice in order to achieve this paradise?\"\n\nHara's smile faded, replaced by a look of cunning. \"Why, John, the cost is of little consequence. A simple signature upon a contract, and the rest will be taken care of. Consider it a small price to pay for an eternity of peace.\"\n\nIn my moments of weakness and despair, I gave into Hara's tempting offer and signed the contract. But as soon as the ink had dried, I regretted my decision. The realm of sleep was not the eternal rest that Hara had promised, but a world of terror and darkness.\n\nI saw demons, their twisted forms so unkempt and raw, with eyes that blazed like fiery coals and fangs that gnashed like saws. They came to me in dreams, a horde of the nightmarish kind, with claws that reached for me and tongues that slicked with bile and grime. I felt their hot breath on my neck, their rank, musky scent, and heard the howls they made, like music from the descent. These demons seemed to revel in their power to oppress, to see the fear they wrought upon my soul with cruel success. And as I stared into their eyes, I saw that they were real, the monsters of my deepest fears, the things I had to feel.\n\nDesperate to escape, I stumbled upon a door. In a moment of recklessness, I threatened to leave, but Hara warned me against it. The demon's voice was low and menacing, filled with a dark power that filled me with dread.\n\n\"Foolish mortal,\" Hara hissed, \"you think to escape the contract so easily? The realm of sleep is eternal, and you are bound to it for all eternity. Leave now, and you will face a fate far worse than any nightmare.\"\n\nAs the dream-like state began to fade, I was met with a reality far more grim and unyielding than I had imagined. The soft, ethereal shadows gave way to the cold, hard floor beneath me. I attempted to move, but found myself unable to do even the simplest of tasks. The once fluid movements of my body now felt sluggish and unresponsive.\n\nThe weight of Hara's deceit pressed down upon me like an anvil. The promised \"eternal slumber\" now felt like a cruel joke, as I was trapped in this wakeful nightmare. I tried to call out, to demand answers from the demon who had lured me into this trap, but my voice was but a whisper. For moment I believed that I was in still in a dream. But alas, I could move my head, twitch my face, open and close my eyes. Panic set in as I realized the terrible truth - I was paralyzed.",

        "text": "  \n\nI always wanted a family and a home. I was in love with a good man, and he was as ready to marry and have kids as I was. \n\nAs usual, life showed up and wrecked it all. \n\nI was on my way to 8:00 Microbiology one morning, and a drunk frat boy ran a red light and plowed into my car at a red light, top speed. The two legs that my boyfriend loved to touch were both broken in multiple places, and the ovaries that were supposed to help me produce those children I was dying to have were both severely damaged along with the rest of my internal organs. So, during the semester that I was supposed to finish up junior year as a premed student, I was forced to withdraw from my classes and watch the world from my comfortable traction frame in the hospital. The doctors who operated on me had been kind enough not to go for the full hysterectomy on the day I was hurt, but when I came to I was very delicately told that the odds were not good. My boyfriend stayed right there with me, and he was holding me when I took my second first steps. That was nice, but the “there’s still a chance” thing evaporated when the ovarian cysts and the scar tissue forced me to agree to a hysterectomy – at the ripe old age of twenty three. That was about the time that my boyfriend started to become distant, and then I didn’t have him anymore.\n\nI won’t lie, I was fairly suicidal then. Without him, and without hope for children, I really didn’t see that I had that many reasons to live. I was so in love with kids and family that I had been determined since high school to be an OB/GYN. After a year of coming back from the crash, I was extremely behind and my entire peer group had moved on by two semesters, so there went my great college experience. I also couldn’t bear the thought of being around pregnant women and infants – maybe that’s cold, but the pain was incredible, and it still is. I couldn’t just keep spiraling, so when I could drive and get around again, I made an appointment with my advisor to try and sort out what to do with my life post-accident. \n\nShe listened to my story, and then she gave me a life-changing piece of advice – if the pain of losing out on having children was too much to let me bring them into the world, maybe I should consider helping those who’d had the same pain. She pointed out that I had enough psych hours to put me three semesters from a degree in psychology. That would allow me to pursue a master’s degree in counseling, and then I could work in mental health. That was at least a glimmer of hope, especially from where I was sitting, so I took the opportunity. I started taking classes again, and I even met the woman who is my best friend today. Danielle and I became friends in our Early Childhood Development class the first semester I was back, and we shared a schedule and an apartment all the way through grad school. When we were done, we even got jobs at the same school. She was a social studies teacher, and I was the school’s guidance counselor. \n\nLife was good then. I built a career, I had close friends, and I was seeing a guy that I really liked. I still wasn’t over my last boyfriend (and I’m still really not), and I don’t believe that a woman ever gets over being unable to ever have kids, but my life as a counselor and a woman with good friends was a hell of a lot more appealing than the life I had lead confined to that bed with pins in my legs. \n\nI was a little itchy to stretch my horizons, and Danielle had said multiple times that we ought to have a private practice together. I didn’t think much of it, but then one day at a staff lunch I mentioned the idea to the vice principal. She loved the idea, and she encouraged me to look into it. Thus encouraged, I started researching ways to establish a private office. The prospects didn’t look great, but then the VP told me that she’d spoken to her husband (a surgeon in the Air Force) and that he’d said that the military contractor that coordinated healthcare for the base he worked on was letting contracts for someone specializing in family and early childhood therapy. \n\nI figured it for a long shot, but I took the number she gave me and called them. For the first time in a while, an unexpected good thing happened, and shortly Dani and I had a private office with a steady flow of clients. I really do care about people and mental health, but I can’t help but say that for the first time since I’d given up medical school the prospect of an above-teacher paycheck was pretty sweet. It also, more importantly, would give me more of a chance to help my patients in the long term instead of a thirty minute session during school lunches with kids I didn’t really know. We rented a small office, hired a secretary, and suddenly I was a woman with a boyfriend, good friends, and a business. \n\nThe clientele took some getting used to. This was around 2010, and the vast majority of my referrals were for women and kids who’d lost husbands and fathers in the Middle East. I worked hard to help them, but there is only so much you can do in those situations even as a therapist. I spent more than a few hours crying with widowed moms, and more holding their crying children. \n\nOne day I was going over the new referrals for week, and I noticed that I was scheduled for a first appointment with a boy named Jacob. The referral sheet listed the reason for the consult as “Depressed Behavior/difficulty following father’s death.” That was by no means unusual, so at one-o’clock I walked into my office to find a perfectly normal-looking eight year old sitting on the couch beside his mother. \n\nI introduced myself, and Jacob and his mother were more than cordial. We talked for a while, and other than being quiet Jacob wasn’t at all unusual. After a while, I asked Jacob if he would mind my talking to his mother alone for a little while. He went into the waiting area, and I asked his mother to give me a description of his symptoms. She suddenly got very somber – not like she had been just before. \n\nI asked her to describe his symptoms to me, and she said that he’d been asking questions about his father’s death. It’s perfectly normal for a child to have questions when one of their parents has passed away, and it’s also normal for a grieving widow to have great difficulty talking about it. I pointed these things out to her, I thought pretty gently.\n\nShe said, “You don’t understand. He’s not asking me about his father’s service, or what kind of person he was, or whether the two of them ever spent any time together when Jake was a baby. He wants to know –“her voice trailed off.\n\nAfter a few seconds, I asked “What kind of questions has he been asking, then?”\n\n“The other night, I was in the living room alone. I thought Jake was in bed, but he came down and sat on the couch with me. I asked if he’d had a bad dream or if he was hungry or something.”\n\nShe looked very disturbed.\n\n“He asked me ‘Did they bring home dad’s legs’”.\n\nI asked if her husband had lost his legs.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“Yes – but Jake didn’t know that. My husband died in an IED blast. His legs were severed, but the casket they brought him back in was never opened. They told me what happened, obviously, but I would never have told my boy that. Jake doesn’t know that – or at least, he shouldn’t.”\n\nI have to say that, as a therapist, you sometimes have to take a pragmatic view of things in spite of your own feelings. My first thought as a clinician was that this kid may be asking uncomfortable questions as a way to trigger upset in his mother. Again, it’s cold, but when a person feels uncomfortable expressing upset, they might say or do things to evoke those feelings in others as a way to mask their own grief. It’s common, but uncommonly so among young boys with anxiety and depression. \n\nI talked to Misses Rittemeyer for a little while longer, and she gave me some more information. She said that Jake had also talked about wanting to talk to the men who’d served with his father, and that he’d been claiming to have vivid conversations with his father in his dreams. There was definitely something going on with him, and it wasn’t something that would be pleasant to confront, but it also wasn’t something I hadn’t dealt with beforehand. \n\nWe finished up, and when they left I really thought that I’d had a normal first consult with a normal patient. The next Monday, Jacob showed up for his appointment accompanied by his father’s mother. She said that Jacob’s mom was a nurse and worked during the day, so he’d be riding with her most counseling days. Jacob and I went to the office, and this is where it gets weird.\n\nI asked Jake to tell me how he felt about his dad – just in general. \n\n“I haven’t met him yet. He can only talk to me when I’m asleep, and his body’s gone.”\n\nHis demeanor was changing, and he wasn’t like he’d been in the first meeting. I told him that I knew what he’d asked about his dad’s legs, and I asked if his dad had told him about that. He said that he had. I honestly didn’t think that I was dealing with anything except a hurting little boy who was manifesting symptoms of anxiety, so I went ahead with the textbook play – gently call out the bullshit.\n\nI said, “Does your dad ask you to ask your mom these questions?”\n\nHe said, “No, not really. He tells me things, but he mostly talks in pictures. If I don’t get it all when he shows me, I ask my mom what it means.”\n\nI asked “What does he show you?”\n\nHe said “He’s showed me how he died - some things he did with his friends. He sometimes shows me how things were before I was born.”\n\nUp to this point, he hadn’t said anything I didn’t expect. I was trying to break through the walls he had up, so I amped up the probing. \n\nI asked “So, your dad’s in heaven now? Has he showed you heaven?”\n\nHe just kept staring at the floor.\n\n“No – it’s not heaven. It’s not like that. There are a lot of people in there.”\n\nI could tell that this was going to be a rough process, and I didn’t see any good in trying a *Dammit kid we both know you’re lying* approach – highly unprofessional and almost always unproductive.\n\nWe talked for about thirty minutes, and I asked his grandmother if she would speak to me in private. She came in and sat down, and I played a hunch. I was sure that Jacob was acting out of his own accord, but there was still the question of how he was getting this information that he was asking about. Doing some simple math, I figured that if his mother wasn’t lying – and I had no reason to think that she was – he might be getting it from his grandmother. After all, a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law, both reeling from the loss of the same man – one could see where there might be some conflict.   \n\nI asked her, “Does Jake ever talk to you about Luke?”\n\nShe thought about it for a second, then she said “Not really – not as much as I would like. I wish he would let it out, but he’s really quiet when we’re together.”\n\nWell, damn.\n\n“Does he interact with your husband at all?”\n\n“No. This is my second marriage – my husband isn’t his grandfather. Rick works offshore anyway, so he’s not around Jake much.”\n\nThat took me nowhere fast, so I wound up the conversation and Renee (his grandmother) took Jake and left. I was at a loss. What I was seeing with Jacob wasn’t exactly new, but there was the lingering question of how he might’ve found out about these things. His mother had told me about the legs thing, and that he often spoke about his father’s platoon mates as if he knew them. My working theory was that he was already acting out because of grief, but that there was some outside actor who was indulging this by telling him these stories. It wouldn’t do me much good to confront the misbehavior without taking care of whoever was subsidizing it. I decided that I would have to call the bluff, but in a subtle way. \n\nMonica (Jacob’s mother) had said that Luke’s friends from the Army only met Jacob at the funeral, and he had been three years old. They lived all over the country, and Jake really had no way of covertly contacting them. I called Monica over the weekend, and by a stroke of luck Jake was out of the house. I told her what I was thinking, and she was willing to help me work through this. I know it’s not easy to doubt or confront your own child, but to her credit she was determined to help Jacob. I also think she was increasingly uncomfortable with the questions he was asking, and she was willing to risk upsetting him if it stopped the morose conversations – after all, she did lose her husband too. I asked her if she had any way of contacting anyone from Luke’s unit, and she said that she could contact them via social media if she needed to. I asked her to put me in touch with one of them if they were willing, and she said she’d try.\n\nIt took two weeks, but she finally called me one afternoon and said that she had told Luke’s platoon leader, Lieutenant Francis Versano, about what was happening in Jake’s therapy and that he’d help me. I had a video conference with him, and I told him what I wanted to do. If Jake’s story was that he was talking to his dad and that he knew all about his war experiences, what would be the harm in having him talk to an old Army buddy? I felt that if Jacob was shown someone who’d actually served with his father, he might realize that the proverbial jig was up and we might reach a turning point. \n\nWe decided to have a video conference on the day of Jake’s next therapy session. I’d bring Jake in, the computer would be on the table in front of us, and Versano would greet him and start up a conversation. I really thought I’d nailed it down, and on Monday I brought Jacob in for his session as if nothing was out of the ordinary. \n\nHe sat down at the table, and I said “Jake, I’ve got a surprise today. Someone who knew your dad well is with us, and he’s gonna talk to us today.”\n\nI flicked my laptop out of sleep mode, and there was Versano. I started to ask Jacob if he knew who he was looking at, but before Versano or I could say anything Jacob looked calmly at the screen and said “Oh, Frank.”\n\nI froze. Versano kept his composure, though.\n\n“Hey there, buddy. What’s going on today?”\n\nI don’t know how to explain this, but Jacob’s face changed. I’ve said that he was normally quiet and withdrawn, but now he suddenly had a smile on his face – an adult smile. His eyes weren’t wide and clear like a child. They were eyes full of age and contemplation, and there was immediately a strange air in the room with us.\n\n“Frank, I’ve been trying to find you. I have something to tell you.”\n\nI’d prepped Versano and I’d told him about the questions Jake was asking and the “dream talks”. I have to say, he played it cool – at first.\n\n“That’s what Misses Theresa told me. She says you wanna know some things about your dad. You know, Jakee, I was with your dad – “\n\n“He knows you tried, Frank.”\n\nI looked at Versano out of the corner of my eyes. I was sitting on the couch by Jacob with the computer in front of us, and I didn’t want to look as panicked as I was. I’m telling you, you could actually see the color draining out of this man’s face.\n\n“What?” he asked in a thin voice.\n\nJacob was still smiling, his voice remaining calm and cool.\n\n“He saw you. You tried to find him – to help him.”\n\nVersano cleared his throat. He tried to regain his composure.\n\n“Jake, I don’t know who you’ve talked to about how your dad passed away, but I - ”\n\n“He told me, Franky. He showed me. That scatter bomb trashed the Humvee and you ended up in the ditch. Your leg was busted up real bad.”\n\nMy eyes fell from the screen. It was all I could do not to run from this child, and I couldn’t have stayed there if I had looked at either one of them. Versano’s expression and his voice told me that, somehow, this boy wasn’t kidding – he knew these things.\n\n“You were trying to find him. He was dead when the bomb went off – gone below his belt line. You couldn’t reach him in the smoke and the blood, but you dragged yourself from the ditch to the middle of the wreck – ducked the flames. He saw you coming, and he was so proud to have a friend like you. He knows you tried, Frank, and he still loves you.”\n\nI still couldn’t look up, but I heard the choking and blubbering sounds from Versano’s webcam and then the silence when he shut off the feed. I didn’t think I could be that afraid of a child, but I was shaking. Kevin turned around to look at me, serene as you could imagine.\n\n“Thank you for letting me see him. I asked mom about it, but she didn’t want to. It really helped.”\n\nI told Jake to go back to his grandmother – that we were done for the day. I honestly just wanted him to be gone. I told the secretary to cancel my appointments and I went straight home. I locked the doors and hid myself in my own bedroom like I was waiting for my eight-year-old patient to roll up in my driveway and murder me. I had to sit and think for a while to calm myself down, but then I realized that I was dealing with a patient who obviously was in some kind of trouble. Yes, it was disturbing, but this was obviously more of a problem than I had been banking on. \n\nHis grandmother had said that he wouldn’t talk to her. Jake’s mother had verified the story about Renee’s husband working offshore, so that negated him. Versano’s reaction had quashed the hope that Jacob was making all of these things he claimed to know. The only suspect I could see, with all of my therapist’s instincts, was Renee. She had been perfectly civil every time we met, and she was very attentive to Jacob. There was no evidence that she might be feeding into Jake’s behavior, but she was the only one in his life who might know anything about Luke’s death. It hardly made sense that his mother would pump him up with a bunch of morose details about his dad’s death and then sign her own kid up for therapy. I had to talk to her alone, so I decided to call her in the morning and request that she come to my office later in the week. \n\nShe showed up that Wednesday with Jacob in tow. She left him in the waiting room and came back to my office, looking a little perturbed.\n\n“Renee, I’ve run into a problem with Jake’s therapy. I think you might be able to help me.”\n\n“Sure” she said.\n\nI swirled several sentences around in my head looking for one that didn’t sound accusatory, but it turned out that there wasn’t one. \n\n“Renee – has Monica told you her reasons for bringing Jacob to me.”\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“No. Only that she thought he was having trouble and she wanted to head it off. She told me about the dreams. She said he was asking about Luke, but I didn’t think that that was unusual.”\n\n“Then Jake hasn’t asked you anything about Luke?”\n\n“No – I told you before that he hadn’t.”\n\n“Yes, you did, but Renee – Jacob has been asking his mother questions about his father that a child his age wouldn’t come up with on his own, and –“\n\n“What is it exactly that you think I might’ve told him?” she snapped.\n\nWell, there went the gentle approach.\n\n“He knows how his father died.”\n\nRenee nodded in a sarcastic way.\n\n“Yes, he knows his father died in war. His father was a soldier. He didn’t need his grandmother to tell him that.”  \n “No – I mean he knows exactly how his father died. He told Frank Versano how it happened.”\n\n“Frank Versano? You’ve spoken to Frank?”\n\n“Yes, Jake and I. I wanted Versano to –“\n\n“You shouldn’t have subjected him to that! He’s a child!”\n\nShe was yelling so loud that my ears rang. She was ranting about Jacob’s being a child and my incompetence. Finally, when I thought that she’d let out enough steam to speak, I interrupted her.\n\n“Renee, I have a responsibility to your grandson and your family. LCT didn’t give me this position for me to give half-assed solutions to Jake – “\n\n“What? You work for LCT?”\n\nHer voice had changed now. She wasn’t angry anymore. The look and tone of rage was replaced with bewilderment and a swelling fear.\n\n“Yes. Why?”\n\n“Jake! Jake, come in here!”\n\nJacob opened the office door and looked in, moving his eyes from me to his grandmother.\n\n“Jakee, come here.”\n\nJake walked over to the sofa and stood in front of Renee. She reached out and clutched his shoulders, looking into his eyes as if she was looking past them and hunting for what ailed him in the back spaces of his little head.\n\n“Jake, your dad – you talk to him, really?”\n\n“Yes. At night” he said flatly, his grandmother’s agitation seeming not to phase him.\n\n“Jakee, where is he? Did you see him, you know, in heaven? A happy place, Jake?”\n\nRenee was beginning to break down. I was so confused. She had been perfectly fine, if irate, just a few seconds before. Now, her chin was furrowed and quivering as violently as her hands. Her chest and stomach were heaving as her breath came in pants.\n\n“No. He’s in a cage – that thing in the back of his head took him there.”\n\nRenee sniffling turned into a wail. It was a guttural sound, like a wounded animal that had no more strength to fight. She stood up suddenly, grabbing Jacob’s arm. \n\n“Renee, let’s just talk about this. Please. Please don’t leave let’s just –“\n\nThe banging of the door as Renee flung it open shook the windows. She wasn’t hearing me at all. She was pulling at Jacob so hard that his feet were barely touching the ground as she dragged him out of the office’s front door. I ran after them, flanked by Misty, my secretary. I was sprinting just to catch up to Renee, and when I reached the front door Renee was already stuffing Jacob into the passenger seat of her car. I ran to her as she made for the driver’s side door.\n\n“Renee, this isn’t healthy for him. Please, whatever you’re feeling –“\n\nI felt my front teeth plunge into my lips as her fist collided with my mouth. I felt the shrubs of the front flower bed scratching and stabbing my back and arms, but my vision was too blurry for me to see Misty’s face as she tried to tug me out of the bushes. I heard tires screeching out of our parking lot. \n\nMisty managed to get me back to my office. My watering eyes did me a favor by not letting me see the faces of the patients who’d been sitting in the waiting area. I was in shock. Misty got me an ice pack and sent the clients home. I must’ve sat in my chair for an hour before I got my senses back, and I still had to be driven home. \n\nI didn’t leave my house for the rest of the week. It wasn’t that she’d hit me – that was just the straw that broke the camel’s back. The darkness that had been hanging around me since my first session with Jake finally broke through, and even in silence I could still hear him saying that his dead father was in a cage.\n\nDanielle visited me over the weekend, and that brought me back to myself somewhat. \n\n“What are you gonna do? Please tell me you aren’t gonna let this be the end of our practice.”\n\n“I don’t know if we have a choice, Dani. I don’t know what I did – or said, but I have a feeling that she’s already talking to LCT.”\n\n“How come?”\n\n“She knows them. She seemed to at least. That’s what set her off.”\n\n“You want me to call the liaison and poke around? If she’s filed a complaint with them, Stephanie would tell me.”\n\n“No. I don’t want to make it worse. They’ll call me, I’m sure.\n\nBut there was no call. I saw all the rest of my regular clients that week, and there was no mention of LCT or Jacob. Monica had cancelled his regular Monday appointment the previous Friday when I was off, and she didn’t call back to reschedule. I waited every minute for my phone to ring. I kept rehearsing my response to the “we’ve been told/in light of these events” conversation that I was certain was forthcoming, but the call didn’t come.\n\nI came back Monday rested and somewhat more relaxed. I put Jacob and his family out of my mind as best as I could. I love my work, and I believe that I bring light and healing to my patients, but whatever was troubling Jake was beyond me. I satisfied myself by imagining that his grandmother’s outburst signified her reaching a cathartic moment – that she’d taken Jake to Monica and that the three of them had had a long-needed conversation about Luke and their own feelings. I hoped that the problem, whatever it was, had been flushed into the open and that Jake and Monica and Renee were living their lives in a better state of mind. That was just starting to make me comfortable in my practice and in my own skin. \n\nThe following Monday, bright and early in the morning, that newfound peace was shot straight to hell when I walked in and found Monica sitting in my waiting room, Jake sitting next to her, and both of them looking at me as I walked through the door. \n\n“Misses Fuller, good morning. I hope you don’t mind us stopping by.”\n\nMy guts were in my throat.\n\n“No – sure. Need something?” I stammered.\n\n“Well, I kinda want to talk to you. You know, about Renee and all.”  \n I just pointed to my office. Monica told Jake to wait for us. I didn’t even look at him, grateful not to have to be caged in the same small room with him again – I’d had quite enough of that already. \n\nWhen we were inside, Monica sat down on the couch opposite me, looking quite calm.\n\n“My mother-in-law wants me to tell you, first of all, that she’s extremely sorry” she said, eyeing my lower face like she was imagining the now-gone bruises.\n\nI gave a nod.\n\n“She was very stressed. I didn’t enjoy being punched, but she’s lost her only child. I’d probably want to hit someone too.”\n\n“She’s ashamed about that. It’s not her way, please believe me.”\n\n“It’s okay. I’m a big girl, and it wasn’t entirely unexpected.”\n\nMonica nodded, turning her eyes away from me.\n\n“I hope you’ll consider keeping Jake as a patient. He’s getting better with you, and I think he needs you.”\n\nI know I looked at her like a lunatic, but I couldn’t help it. After what we’d just finished discussing, how could she think Jacob had gotten any better?\n\n“Better, Misses Rittemeyer? I have to say, as his therapist, I haven’t seen it.”\n\n“Well, he wasn’t – I really didn’t think his therapy was helping. Until last week, I really didn’t see any difference, but after Renee brought him home he was a different person.”\n\n“Then, Renee didn’t report me?”\n\n“Oh no. Nothing like that. She told me about what she’d said to you. It wasn’t even about you, it’s just that she used to work for the same company – she didn’t part with them on happy terms.”\n\n“Renee is a therapist?”\n\n“No, she’s an engineer – computers and stuff. LCT is a big company. They do a lot of different stuff. She worked R and D, but she couldn’t talk about it. The government is funny about that kind of stuff. Funnily enough, she called them afterwards and she’s going to consult with them. Funny, huh?”\n\nSomething rotten and terrible was swirling around in my stomach, but I couldn’t peg it then. \n\n“I didn’t know that. Still, after that last session, I’ve been waiting for a call from my lawyers.”\n\nMonica smiled.\n\n“No, nothing like that. We’re very happy that Jakee has you. In fact, he asked me if he could see you today when I told him we were coming. I would understand if your answer is ‘No’, but I was wondering –“\n\nShe lifted her eyebrows and folded her hands in a hopeful gesture. I was still uneasy, but I was interested to know what had improved so much that he actually wanted to see me. I told her that I could talk with him for a little while, and she sent him in. I was standing when he entered, and I was bracing myself for that maddeningly blank look that I’d gotten used to seeing when he came for a session, but then there was suddenly a little head against my thigh and a pair of little arms wrapped around both of my legs.\n\n“Jacob?” I asked as I looked down.\n\nHe was snubbing quietly, with little tears streaming down his face as he looked up. His eyes were big and bright – no longer disturbed and distant the way they’d been since day one. \n\n“I shouldn’t have said anything. They turned it off because I told grandma.”\n\nI was sort of swaying back and forth, too stunned to say or do anything sensible. I put my hand slowly on his head, brushing away the hair from his forehead.\n\n“Jake, who? What did you tell us?”\n\nThe maternal instinct must never die, because I forgot at once about all of the weird things that’d come out of Jake’s mouth and I found myself sitting down and pulling him onto my knee, wiping his tears with the back of my hand. \n\n“I told you about dad – that I could talk to him. That’s what they needed.”\n\nThat rotten thing in my insides was swirling again. My training, my professionalism, and my grand theories left. \n\n“That’s what who needed, Jake?”\n\n“The people who have dad. They won’t let me see him anymore. They won’t let him out of the cage – they have what they wanted.”\n\n“What did they want?”\n\n“Grandma. She went back to them. She made the thing in his head, and they put it there. It took him into the cage when he died. They only let me see him so she’d go back, and they turned it off – he can’t get out of the cage anymore!”\n\nI couldn’t breathe. I just sat there with Jake crying on my lap. \n\n*The cage.* \n\nHis grandmother worked with computers.\n\n*The cage.*\n\nHis dad had something in the back of his head.\n\n*The cage.* \n\nWhen his dad died, the thing took him away.\n\n*The cage.*\n\nRenee went back to LCT after Jake said he could speak to his father.\n\n*The cage.*\n\n“They have what they wanted.”\n\n*The cage.*",

        "text": "I don't really know where I am, but at the same time, it feels so... familiar... almost like home. Although I miss my room, and waking up to the smell of my mother's fresh blueberry scones, I've found it very easy to adapt to my new surroundings. Everything and every...one... is rather welcoming. Almost too welcoming. I can't complain though. \n\nThere hasn't been one person to walk by without singing hello, or waving, at the very least. If I'm not at \"home\", I'm either engaging in conversation with. or helping my fellow neighbors. However, the conversations can get kind of weird sometimes. Somehow, a few of them have figured out I'm not from here. I don't recall ever sharing this information... I don't think they mind that I'm different, though. This one lady from across the street once told me, \"We love new meat\". I though it was a pretty odd way to call me a friend, but I paid no mind to it. Perhaps they do and say things differently around here. After all, her grin was from ear to ear, and her eyes were shot wide--- I felt as if she was excited to have someone new around.\n\nAnother thing I love about this place is the children. They're all so sweet. They play outside a lot, and occasionally even bring me little treats. My dog Lucky is also here with me. The kids *love* playing with her. I think Lucky is rather fond of them, too. I think its adorable how she continuously barks when the children knock on my door. I think they could relax on the knocking a little bit though, because sometimes it causes Lucky to whine and whimper. It's rather odd, since Lucky never did that at our other home, but I guess she is still getting used to how things are around here. I don't think any of the children have their own pets, though. This one little girl, Sarah, always comes to play with Lucky. She tells me that she wishes her parents would let her get a dog. Her old one apparently went missing one night after he broke her brother, Liam's, computer. She told me she misses the smell of his mint-washed fur. She still doesn't know what happened to him. This occurred about five days ago.\n\nDinner time is my favorite. Sarah and Liam occasionally accompany me. Something kind of weird happened the other night, though.\n\n As Lily took in a whiff of the stew I cooked, she sighed with relief and fell back in her chair. I chuckled, \"Long day?\". She looked at me and said, \"No not really. I'm only seven years old haha! I don't have much to do in my life. It's just sooo refreshing to finally eat something that doesn't smell like mint\". As soon as she said that, Liam cleared his throat while glaring at Sarah. Sarah's face instantly turned white. She then turned back to eat her stew. I was really confused. What Sarah said wasn't unusual, but Liam's reaction was. I turned to Sarah and inquired, \"What do you mean? Do your meals come with mint leaves on top, or..\" Liam turned to me and said, \"Yeah, we actually have to get going. I forgot dad wants us home for dinner tonight. Let's go, Sarah\". He grabbed Sarah's hand and pulled her from her seat. \"Thank you for the stew\" Liam exclaimed while he lead Sarah out from my house. Something was off, but I didn't want to be nosey. Lucky was acting a bit weird though. She seemed scared, like she'd just seen something horrific. I didn't pay much attention to it.\n\nYeah, that's pretty much everything about my new community. Right now, I'm out looking for Lucky. I woke up this morning and couldn't find her. I sprinted out of my house, almost tripping over her Lemon-scented fur wash. I was running around my neighborhood, looking probably as frantic as ever. The lady that I had previously mentioned about welcoming me stopped me when I ran past her house. She brought me inside, where I was also greeted by Liam and Sarah. I guess this woman was their mother. She sat me down at their table and handed me a glass of water. While I was drinking it, I couldn't help but notice how nervous Sarah looked. I would catch her occasionally looking over at me with a scared expression painted on her face. I think she was just worried for me though. She had never seen me such a mess. \n\nThe lady offered me something to eat. I was kind of scatter-brained, so I figured some food in my stomach would help, as well as give me energy to keep looking for Lucky. She placed a plate of salad with... what looked like chicken?... in front of me. The scent was kind of off though. It sort of smelled like... lemon... but off. I was too much in a rush to stop and think about what the hell she was feeding me. I devoured it in about five minutes. I drank the rest of the water and politely thanked the woman. On my way out, I gave the woman my condolences for the loss of their dog, and that I was actually out looking for mine. She stared at me confused and said \"Um, we never had a dog.. are you feeling okay?\". I was incredibly confused, but I had bigger things to worry about. I waved goodbye to Sarah and Liam. Liam waved goodbye as normal, but Lily was tearing up for some reason... I didn't have time to think about that, though. I still had to find Lucky.\n\nRight now, I'm searching for Lucky again. I can't stop thinking about that salad. Now that I think about it, it actually smelled *horrible---* gut wrenchingly horrible.  It really smelled like expired lemon, or death and lemon. I can't put my finger on it. Just thinking about it makes me want to puke it all up. \n\nWhatever, I still have to find... I still have to...find...wait, what am I looking for? I stopped in my tracks and frantically looked around.\n\nThis isn't... my home. No. I have to calm down. I feel like I'm losing my mind... You know, now that I really look at my neighbors, I can't help but notice how different they look from me. The scenery began to look... fake. Unreal. I need to leave.. I-I need to wake up-\n\nLike I said, I don't exactly *know* where I am, but that doesn't matter to me. I live alone though. Some company every now and then would be nice. The people here look really different from me, and say some pretty weird things. I can't judge though... maybe the things they do and say are just different than where I'm from... wherever that may be.",

        "text": "I don’t even know where I am. It’s dark all around, my phone barely lights up my fingers as I’m typing this. It almost feels as though I’m covered by a thick veil of blackness. Fuck, I’ve just been sitting idly twirling my thumbs before I caved and typed out my thoughts. My phone shows no signal but I somehow managed to get hooked up to the internet. Fuck, this doesn’t make sense. I mean, I’d believe I was drunk or high or something but FUCK ALL! I swear on my life I’m not under the influence when I say this; but I think I somehow no-clipped through reality. I mean, a place like this can’t possibly be real, right? Haha, look at me, asking nobody in particular. \n\nI hate being alone and anyone who knows me will tell you how much I hate isolation. This feels like a nightmare but no matter how many times I pinch myself, I’m still in this foreign place. I tried to reach out to anyone, ANYONE on my Facebook, Instagram, Twitter—and nothing! Either the whole world is in on a sick joke where they all collectively ignore my existence, or my posts don’t actually make it through. So now here I am, typing this out on Reddit for anyone to see. PLEASE SOMEONE RESPOND. The silence is loud, like a cricket ringing in my skull. Ffs this platform is my last hope so I’m praying this will work. \n\nI’m gonna log my journey as I start venturing further into this veil of darkness. Wish me luck, haha…\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThose three stars will signify a new entry. I’d specify the time but the clock on my phone has been stuck on the same numbers; 15:33. I have no sense of time in this place! On the plus side, it seems like my battery will last indefinitely so I don’t have to worry about preserving juice. \n\nHow far have I travelled? God knows. And for how long? I’m just as clueless. My phone flashlight doesn’t even illuminate an inch ahead of me. Whatever, I can only go forward anyways. Though after what felt like an eternity, I finally hit a wall. No, literally, I walked face first into a wall. My nose hurts, I think I might’ve broken it. It’s not the worst pain ever but breathing through my mouth is not pleasant. I hope I can find an exit soon. In the meanwhile, I’ll keep hugging the wall and move forward. Surely I’ll find a corner, or a turn somewhere, right? Right? \n\nI’ll be back later. Toodles.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFuck I’m sore. I’ve been following the wall forever and it doesn’t end. I had to take a break, my poor legs are killing me. I’m sitting on the ground for a moment before I keep going. I should take this time to reflect on my situation. I’m in some unknown place which seems to go on forever with no end in sight, and I can’t see a damn thing. Yet I remember hanging out with my friends just like it was yesterday. We were at a party…shit, I’m not even sure now. There were people. I remember thinking it was too many, but now I wish I could see them again. I’d be happy to see anyone’s face right now. Being alone like this…stuff of nightmares, I swear. \n\nI think I would’ve gone batshit crazy if I wasn’t typing this. My internal monologue can only keep me so much company. Meanwhile I can only hope my post will go through once I hit send. I could take my chances now, but…I’m also a little scared to find out. This draft is my only way of keeping track of things, and a part of me is afraid to know the inevitable truth; whether or not I’ve become a ghost to reality. So if you read this far, please don’t stop. That means it worked, and maybe someone can guide me through this bullshit. \n\nI will keep pressing on. What else can I do, really?\n\nTata for now.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIs there a song describing total darkness? Total, blinding veil of black? I can’t think of one. Fact of the matter, I can’t recall any tunes. Sounds like nonsense, right? Yeah I know, I thought so too, but my head is an empty echo chamber with my own worries. It’s just as devoid of anything as this space. I’ve only moved forward and made no visible progress. Why is it so empty? Why is my head so empty? \n\nI can feel the ceiling if I stretch my arm out fully above my head. That’s new, I never noticed it before. Was it always like that? Either way, I couldn’t help but feel some form of relief. Finally, something that felt different. A wall and a ceiling. Which means there should be an exit. So this must be some kind of sick joke, right? Maybe my friends are all ignoring me…Yeah, totally. They’re all on board with some sick joke. Are we near April Fools? Wait, no, we were at a New Years party just before all of this started. \n\nI was pinged by Facebook as I was getting ready to keep moving forward. My friends and coworkers were all together for a night out; at least according to the pictures they posted. How come no one wondered about me? They don’t seem to notice I’m gone. Or if they did, they don’t care at all. Did I do something wrong? Why is this happening to me? \n\nI wish I had some ice. The swelling on my nose is ridiculous. Not only that but I’d love to be able to use my nostrils again. Have I ever mentioned how claustrophobic I am? Anyone who knows me would agree. I can’t even stand the heat of my own breath while wearing a scarf! Being deprived of cold, fresh air is quite tortuous to say the least. \n\nI want out of here. I want out of this nightmare. Someone please help me.\n\nHelp me.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nTHE SPACE HAS ONLY GROWN NARROW AND I CAN FEEL THREE WALLS NOW.\n\nI’m scared I can’t stop shaking. I tried to turn around only to hit another wall. I’m in some kind of magic cement cage where the only way is forward AND IT KEEPS GETTING MORE CRAMPED.\n\nThe ceiling is barely touching the top of my head. I can’t stop crying. This isn’t real. This can’t be. Once I finally post this, it will be my only solace. I keep holding onto the thought that this narrow corridor will lead to an open space but…even I have my doubts…\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHelp.\n\nI’m struggling to type with one hand. I made a terrible mistake moving forward and now I’m stuck crawling. My head is stuck to the side. My eyes hurt from side glancing. \n\nThe ceiling is gonna crush me if I keep moving. I barely fit as is. The path never got bigger. \n\nI’m gonna hit post and pray for the best. I should’ve gambled my luck sooner. If anyone sees this, please give me a sign. And if anyone ever gets stuck in a place like this, DON’T MOVE FORWARD.\n\nI don’t know if I’ll die of a heart attack, lack of oxygen, or if this place will come crashing down…I just refuse to die without an answer.\n\nCan anyone see this post?",

        "text": "Even as a resident, I knew the story of James Gain. Dr. Gain was a doctor at Haven Port Hospital for over thirty years, working specifically in the pharmaceuticals department. He was beloved by his patients, nurses, doctors, management, the janitors, even people who came by only once to pick up a single prescription. Winter of 2012, Dr. Gain was fired after giving the wrong medication to a nine-year-old boy with a heart-defect, Edward Richardson. Edward died in his house a week or two after the medication was given to him. The Richardson family was extremely wealthy, and threatened to close the entirety of the hospital, and serve every single person in the hospital who had even interacted with Edward a lawsuit. Management knew they were going to be sued into oblivion anyway, so to soften the blow they ended up firing Dr. Gain. \n\nOn the day of December 29th, Dr. Gain was given the notice of his firing, and, while you're not supposed to use the word \"insane\" in our hospital, Dr. Gain literally went insane. He took a scalpel, went down to the ED, and stabbed three patients and a nurse. Two of the patients survived, while eighty-seven-year-old Marta Sanders, a woman who had taken a tumble down her stairs, and Nurse Jacobs, a man with a wedding in less than five days, tragically passed away. Before security was able to stop Dr. Gain, Dr. Gain took his own life by shoving the scalpel he had just used to kill two people on himself, jamming it into his neck. \n\nThe story made mainstream news, about the horrible tragedy that had happened at Haven Port Hospital, yet the story seemed to disappear after a few days. Life was expected to go back to normal, people were supposed to go back into the ED without the vision of Nurse Jacobs blood on the walls, Marta Sanders body fallen out of her bed, and the silver scalpel sticking out of Dr. Gain's neck. \n\nThey say on the anniversary of Dr. Gain's death, something always goes horribly wrong in a single department. Last year, the radiology department left a metal tray table inside the MRI room. Once the machine was turned on, the table rammed itself into the machine from the magnets and put a patient into a permanent coma. The year before that, psychology had a patient suffering from anorexia randomly, and suddenly grabbed a chair and threw it at a doctor, and then jumped out of their rooms window, plummeting to their death. Nothing ever good happens on December 29th. Most people try to skip that day, pass their shift off to an unsuspecting intern, or resident. \n\nI got stuck with the shift on December 29th. The ten-year anniversary of Dr. Gain's death. Something bad was going to happen, everyone in that hospital knew it. I won't lie, even I tried passing off my shift to other people, but I had no luck. I parked my car in front of the hospital that day, got out of it, and genuinely contemplated not going in at all, and just faking sick. I'm not that superstitious, I swear, but I did not want to go in. But I still did. \n\nAt 8:00 AM, a light fell in the OR, falling directly on a patient having open heart surgery, as well as one of the surgeons involved, knocking him out, and killing the patient. \n\nAt 9:00 AM, a printer in the finance department explodes, and gives one of the employees a third degree burn to her face, as well as injuring a few others. \n\nAt 11:00 AM, the long-term care center was hit with four different patients going into cardiac arrest at the exact same time. All four elderly patients died. \n\nAt 12:00 PM, a car rammed into the front doors of the hospitals waiting room, luckily it missed all of the chairs full of waiting patients, but it still hit the secretary head on, the driver was thrown from his seat through the windshield, into the brick wall directly in front of him. Both died a few hours later. \n\nAt 2:00 PM, a heater in the pediatrics department set fire to a curtain nearby, and then a wall, and then multiple patient rooms. Five kids, four parents, and two doctors were stuck inside those rooms. Three kids, two parents, and one doctor walked out. \n\nAt 5:00 PM, the skyway connecting the hospital partially collapses, injuring seven, and killing two who were on the skywalk. Underneath the skywalk is the hospitals parking lot, the skyway crushed three people inside of an SUV below, killing all three. \n\nAt that point, the hospital directed all calls out of the hospital, we just couldn't take anymore. Only a few departments stayed open, including pharmaceuticals. \n\nAt 7:00 PM, two lab assistants, and the head of epidemiology are exposed to a life-threatening disease when a vial falls to the floor and breaks. They're still in quarantine, one of them in critical condition. \n\nMy shift always ends at 9:00, and the time was 8:45. I'd been giving out drugs and medication all day, hearing about the disasters unfold in the hospital, one, and then another, and then another. I'd had enough that day. After the first two incidents, the pharmacy closed to only patients who needed necessary medications, ones that couldn't even survive a day without their meds. Surprisingly, that was around forty eight people.  \n\nWhen it comes to the most necessary of drugs, people reserve times for when they want to pick theirs up. I'm an extremely organized person. I line up the medication in a perfect line, based on the time people come in to pick their medication up at, so I can just grab the closest one, give it to the person, and go on with my day. I was rushing back and forth between pharmaceuticals and the ED all day, helping the nurses and doctors there with the mass amounts of patients that had came in, and quickly delivering people their medications. \n\nNearing the end of the day, I was able to finally just relax, and sit down. Out of the forty-eight bottles that used to sit on the counter, only one remained now. A man then entered the pharmacy, requesting his normal medication. I walked up to the counter, grabbed the orange pill bottle, and threw it to the man. He caught the catch, and waved as he left the pharmacy. Before he could make it to the exit, however, he turned back, and placed the bottle on the counter. \n\n\"Hey, this isn't my prescription. I can't even read whatever the hell this is.\" \n\nHe passed the bottle to me, and I read the label, \"Acetaminophen-hydrocodone\" \n\n\"I need warfarin, not whatever the hell this stuff is. C'mon man, I could've died.\" \n\nI looked to my left at the counter. I was out of pill bottles. I couldn't have made a mistake, though, I knew exactly where I placed those bottles. I knew the exact position they were in, the order they were in, I knew almost everything you needed to know about those bottles.  \n\nIt wasn't my fault.  \n\nIt wasn't my fault they got the wrong medication.  \n\nIt wasn't my fault. \n\nThey should have checked the name on the medication. \n\nIt wasn't my fault. \n\nThey should have been more careful. \n\nIt wasn't my fault. \n\nIt was Dr. Gain. \n\nIt wasn't my fault. \n\nIt had to be Dr. Gain. \n\nIt wasn't my fault they all died. \n\nIs this what Dr. Gain felt? \n\nIt wasn't my fault every single one of them got the wrong medication. \n\nI'm outside the ED with a scalpel right now as I post this.\n\nThe reason I posted this, though, is that I have a question. \n\nWas it my fault?",

That's all you need to know.\n\n\nI heard Teddy doing his usual pawing at the door. I was about to get up and let him in but a glanced and noticed he was asleep next to me. At first I thought maybe it was just some stray begging for food. But then this little fuck meowed. \n\nI shit you not, it sounded IDENTICAL to Teddy. Teddy has a very unique meow that only he can do. \n\nIt sounded as if a recording was being played of his meow. But this also has me questioning, what if it *is* him. \n\nThen what the fuck am I sitting next too? Frankly I'm not too sure, I'm gonna move into the bathroom real quick before he or it wakes up to be safe.\n\nOk I am in the bathroom. Whatever is outside is being relentless, just like my Teddy. I considered going to the bathroom with a window, but I've read enough stories to know that bitch will fuck me over and get in through the window. I also covered the mirror with a towel. I got no idea what I'm dealing with after all.\n\nOh shit, whatever was sleeping with just woke up. It's 8:19pm. The pawing and meowing at the door has been going since 7:54pm. I hear it walking about the house.\n\nIt's 8:21pm. The pawing and meowing stopped.\n\nDammit, there's a paw coming up under the bathroom door. Idk what it is. Wait. NO! I JUST HEARD A CATS SCREECH! TEDDY NOOOOOOOO!\n\nI think he's dead, he's fucking dead. That little fuck killed my fucking cat. I'm certain. It's 8:34. There's a pawing under my door. Oh god... there's blood. There's fucking blood. What the actual fuck. \n\nHold up, that blood.. it's not red.. it's lavender? What in the 7 rings of hell is that? Is that even blood? Ugh god help! It smells noxious!  I hear squelching, round 2 is about to ensue. \n\nAll I hear is crashing, hissing, and squirting. Something just crashed against the door! I want to look under the crack, im gonna stick my phone under the door and snap a recording. \n\nI swear you won't believe me when I say this. I see Teddy, fighting some demon esk... thing? It's oozing that lavender liquid. Lemme break down what it looks like. \nIt has 5 eyes, teeth i can only describe as sharpened human teeth, it is the size of a malnourished 2 year old. It has paws and claws, but it looks like human skin is stretched over them, and it's entire body. Like a big cat wearing a human skin suit. But it has a human head? It's head was twisted upside-down, and it's body contorted in ways I can't even describe. If your wondering how Teddy is fending off gods forgotten creation that Satan stole, he is a HEFTY maine coon cat. One time he brought home a dead chiwawa that I think he killed. This bitch is savage.\n\nOh shit. It stopped. It's dead silent. It's 8:51. I see a black paw under the door with that lavender shit. Praise the lord. Im coming out of the bathroom.\n\nJESUS. Teddy is pretty beat up, this thing I THINK is dead. I'm getting a gun and firing some rounds off in it. Good thing I live away from people.\n\nOk, I just loaded off some rounds in this ugly fucker. Time to take Teddy to the vet NOW. I'll update you guys on his condition.",

        "text": " \n\nThey say it takes a while for humans to get over someone's death, especially if it was someone close to them. I was distraught when my grandmother passed, but I was even more upset at the doll she gave me on my birthday. The doll looked exactly like her with a date written on its tag. \n\n*August, 24th, 1996: The date of my death..*\n\nThe tag wrote. My birthday was on July 1st. It's impossible that my grandmother predicted her death. I know she always had these weird conspiracy theories and had these crazy freakouts about voices in her head, ghosts in her room, and other stupid things like that. My mother thought it was a good idea to put her in a mental hospital for a bit. She did, but that only made my grandmother worse to the point no mental hospital could handle her. Constantly, my grandmother would complain about the food, hospitality, and other things. My mother never grew angry at her at all and just reasoned with her. My mother was a kind soul to everyone, no matter what.\n\nAnyways, back to the present. Things were going well and my grandmother was put on good medication. She didn't complain or have any crazy freakouts anymore. ~~It's almost as if she is being controlled. Now that I think about it, my mother never did mention where she got the pills.~~\n\nAs expected, June came around and so did my birthday. I never liked anything too crazy for my birthday. So, it was just me, my grandma, and my mom. I was excited for today because I was like any other kid, wanting to grow up and explore the adventures of the world. As the singing rang in my ears and the cake was in my view, I was barely staying still in my seat. All I wanted was to pounce on that damn thing and eat it whole, I didn't care who was watching. I had to hold myself back, though. But when that slice of cake was placed in my way, I didn’t hesitate to eat it whole. I think I ended up with a few cavities along the way. The presents time arrived and the first one I got was my grandmother’s. She always gave me interesting gifts. The present was an old, rusty box with some peeling areas. The only thing closing the box was a vintage rope along with a little locket that you had to lift. I carefully untied the rope while my grandmother watched me intently. I was a bit disturbed, but I soon shrugged it off as I separated the two wooden pieces. To my surprise, the box revealed a beautiful doll that looked exactly like my grandmother with rhinestone eyes that reflected off the living room light. Usually, a normal person would be creeped out and confused as to why they were given a dirty, vintage doll with knotted hair to them as a birthday present. I was young, so obviously I was obsessed with dolls. I was happy while my mother looked a bit disgusted. “You gave her *that* for her birthday? It’s dirty and the hair is all knotted.” My mother commented. “Well, yes.” My grandmother responded in her sweet tone. My mother scoffed and got angry. I don’t know what they argued about because of the fact that my father pushed me into my room with the doll. Worst. Birthday. Ever. \n\nAugust was upon us sooner than we thought and we were all very upset in that month. My mother and grandmother’s relationship had gotten worse, I stayed in my room to get away from their nonsense. At this point, I cleaned up the doll and refreshed its hair with conditioner. I had to figure out the hard way why you shouldn't try to straighten a doll's hair with a hair straightener. I also noticed the tag and the writing on it that I had told you about earlier. I paid no mind. Until my grandmother finally died on us. My heart skipped a beat as I realized the date on the doll's tag was today. How we found out? Well, the police came to the door with their hats on their chests and in their pitiest voice they told us my grandmother died of a heart attack. I didn’t buy it, though. My grandmother seemed well, but I guess I was wrong. \n\nIt was funny how my mother seemed so relieved after her death. She was so happy and joyful, it creeped me out. I know some people move on pretty fast, but she didn’t even shed a tear when the police arrived. In fact, she seemed… nervous. \n\nI remembered she always kept a diary in her closet. With her asleep on the couch, I took this as a chance to head upstairs to her room. I shut the door behind me quietly as I could, I let out a breath I didn’t even realize I was holding in. I sneaked over to her closet and opened the twin doors. The first thing that caught my eye was the wooden box in the dark corner of the closet, sulking. Obviously, it stood out to me because it was the same box that the doll my grandmother gave me was in. Which reminded me, that I never got it back after that day. I lifted the locket and there it stood. A black notebook with “Journal” engraved on the front. I quickly grabbed it and got on my knees opening to the first page. Most of the pages were boring, just containing notes and grocery lists. One page piqued my interest, it was recent. It wrote; \n\n*August 10th, 1996. I want to kill my mother. She already went too far with the dirty old doll and pushed my limits. She pisses me off so much. It makes me want to slice her neck open while Carrie is at school and watch her scream and bleed out. I shouldn’t be thinking these things, let alone writing them. But I can’t help it, I hate her.*\n\nMy eyes widened in horror, I didn’t have the guts to read the next paragraph as I saw the word “blood” in it as I turned the page. This page was dated to be much later than the first. Although, I realized I shouldn’t be here when I read it.\n\n*August 23rd, 1996. I finally killed that son of a bitch. I sliced her throat clean and made it look like a heart attack. Carrie never noticed or thought twice. Don’t worry, Carrie. We can finally live in peace.* \n\n*August 24th, 1996. The cops came today and told us of the whore’s death. I was nervous at first, I thought they knew. They didn’t, though, and filed it out as a heart attack. But, I know Carrie wouldn’t believe that. She’s suspicious.* \n\n*CARRIE, I KNOW YOU ARE READING THIS. YOU WILL DIE TONIGHT, I CAN’T HAVE YOU TELLING THEM. WE WERE SUPPOSED TO LIVE IN PEACE.  I LOVED YOU.* \n\nI felt a sharp pain in my stomach. I looked down at my lap only to see a knife sticking out of my stomach. As I realized what happened, I screamed. But my cries were muffled by a hand that smelt of rose perfume. I began to become intoxicated by the perfume being forcefully pushed into my nostrils and mouth. It was my turn to go and by the time you read this, I have already been dead for years now. To you, it’s just February 5th, 2023. I hope you take hold of my warning. She’s still out there. Y’know, I should’ve listened to my grandmother when she predicted this would happen. I lied. What I didn’t tell you was my death date was on that tag too. I still wonder what would happen if I had gotten that pocket knife that was stuffed in the doll. \n\nAugust 27th, 1998: The date of ***my*** death.",

        "text": "Yesterday, I was peacefully sleeping in my bedroom until I heard a cat meowing. The sound awakened me, as I had realized I own no cats. My eyes widened, yet I trusted myself because I have great experience with cats. I opened the door and saw a cat against the wall, looking at me. It was furious, hungry for blood. All I ever remember that day was it lunging at me. I'm not sure what time was it, it was maybe 5 in the morning or so. The sun hadn't rised yet. I just woke up in my bed, hearing the same meowing all over and over again. I couldn't open the door, as it could lead to a loop. I wanted a weapon, no, I needed one. There was a large stick, so I grabbed it. I came prepared, knowing what was waiting for me. I opened the door. My eyes grew wide. My hands were shaking. My ears were hearing things. My brain was hallucinating or I hope so. I didn't want to believe this was real. In front of me was not a creature. I can't even describe it. A silhouette? An eye? Each time I brought up something to define it, I'd find another adjective hidden in this Frankenstein of monsters. My heart dropped, even though it was less than a minute that I had seen it. I closed the door, but I heard banging on it violently. This..thing..I wasn't ready for it. I'm not ready for anything, even. It was 9. I just stood there. The banging filled my ears. I went into a hallucinating state. This is the part where everything went wrong. I saw monsters and other things. At that moment, at that very second, I realized that the thing you fear the most is created by your own self. The banging stopped, and I started becoming lightheaded. I was confused and wondered why it would appear in the morning. The door didn't budge to open this time, and the window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..The window..Why did she do that to me. Don't mind the window. It's not an option. I don't know what was running through my head, but it hurt. It hurt so bad. I just grabbed the sharpest thing I could find and stabbed myself. I didn't think I could do it anymore. I woke up again. I don't think I'm in the real world, nor do I think I am here anymore. Is this the afterlife?, Not sure. It's my same life, my same attitude, my same relatives, my same family and so on..When my sister passed away, just before she did so, she sent me a note saying thanks for being so kind to me, and that she doesn't regret helping that cat earlier. My family figured out that she must've made a mistake, as she had never helpt a cat before, and if she did, she'd tell us. Her note slipped through the window. I cried that night, knowing that it was just a few days before I'd never be able to talk to her again. 2 days later, my mom invited her to our house. Her hand touched the window. I don't want to remember what happened after that.",

        "text": "*Patient Journal Log B.34*\n\n*December 16, 2017*\n\n*Dr. Velmer's Office for State Psychological Assessment*\n\n*Testimony of Patient Noel Jones'*\n\n.\n\n\"July 5th, 2015. The worst day of my life.\n\nI don't know, nor could I fathom a reason why, but my girlfriend of two years decided to break up with me during my best friend's 4th of July party. It was sudden, and it was raw.\n\nI broke down completely that day. Normally I might have felt embarrassed showing emotion in public, especially around my friends--given the fact that I was usually a pillar of stoicism and stability, but I couldn't hold up a façade anymore. Not for that. The tears ran freely down my face as she spat out her break up mantra in the corner of the party room, as strangers and friends looked on with amusement at my pain.\n\nI don't remember much of it, the blaring of the 1970's disco music combined with the drinks drowned out a lot of what she said, but I got the gist. Apparently we weren't compatible anymore, or something. It was utter bullshit, and we both knew it. Not like it mattered.\n\nShe was the love of my life. I even quit my fucking job for her, to spend more time with her when she said our relationship was on the edge, when she said I wasn't \"expressing myself enough\" or some shit. But I did it for her, for us.\n\nI swear on my life I did everything I; anything and everything she ever wanted. She made enough money off her dad's back for the both of us to live comfortably, so it seemed reasonable decision at the time for me to quit to save our relationship.\n\nIn retrospect, it was a foolish decision. But I was just twenty, and I never expected her to pull the rug out from under me like that.\n\nWe shared friends. I knew after the breakup, most, if not all of them, would side with her. I truly had nothing. I saw several of them give me side eyes after her talk with me, like I was already a bad, distant memory to them.\n\nI felt so lost, so hopeless. It seems silly, looking back, but when your whole life flips on its head like that, it's like drowning without a life-saver.\n\nAfter a few more numbing drinks and a good cry or two in the bathroom of the party, I walked back to our apartment to collect my stuff.\n\nSitting there, packing up all my belongings in her place was one of the hardest things I'd ever done. I felt so, *so* numb with sadness, anger and whatever else was stabbing me in my heart. It's hard to express to you, doc. I just felt so numb that I wasn't even sure if those emotions were real or imaginary. But they felt real either way. Damn sure they felt real.\n\nI remember yanking my clothes out of our dresser, like a robot mindlessly doing its monotonous, meaningless job, when I noticed a long, green box in the corner of the closet that was completely covered with dust. You got to understand, I didn't know what it was until I opened it. But just that miniscule spike of curiosity I got from the sight of it drove me out of my grief for just a moment, just long enough to pick it up.\n\nIt was heavy. Really heavy, I knew it had to have been something I forgot through the years. It definitely wasn't new.\n\nI watched the dust fill the room with a cloud of grey as I lightly blew on the top of the box. Afterwards, I opened the lid.\n\nI'm telling you the full truth, doc. A black hunting rifle stared back at me, a shimmering gleam of black-steel. I remembered what it was. It had been a gift from my late Uncle for my 18th birthday. He had always wanted to get me into hunting, but I was never into killing animals for sport. But it really was a beautiful weapon, made me almost rethink my choice of declining him all those years.\n\nI managed to pick it out of its case with some difficulty, feeling it all over; the ridges, the barrel, the stock. 'Finely crafted' would definitely describe it. The coolness of the steel felt good as I ran it through my fingers.\n\nI started estimating its weight, the absolute killing capacity of it. It felt powerful. It made *me feel* powerful, doc.\n\nThat's when I made the decision. The decision that everyone tells you not to take, the decision that everyone tells you is never the answer, the decision that mothers weep over every day of every year. But I made it. Not because I really wanted to, but because I didn't feel like there was any other way out.\n\nI was numb to the core of my being, sad beyond sickness, and I just wanted it to be over. Over for good.\n\nSlowly, I loaded the gun. One bullet after the other, feeling the cold weight of each one in my hands. It really was hard, man. But I still did it. I don't know why. Then, I pointed it towards my right eye.\n\nI'm sure you've heard this a thousand times doc, but ya know how they say your life flashes before your eyes right before you die? Well, I can't exactly say that's true, but something happened in my brain that made me think a second longer then I should have. A second longer then what my trigger finger should have allowed.\n\nI thought about my mom, back in Michigan, asking me if I would ever come back from college. I remembered the promise I gave her.\n\n\"Of course.\" I told her. \"I'll make sure to call every week, too.\"\n\nI remembered the beer I had with my dad as we sat down on the old fishing dock, watching the setting sun the day before I left.\n\n\"You'll be watching this with me again sometime, right?\" The usual gruffness in his voice was replaced with one of slight melancholy, and I could have sworn I saw some mist in his eyes.\n\n\"Wouldn't miss it for the world.\" I replied back, taking another swig of beer.\n\nI remembered my friends back home too.\n\nI thought about my friend Andrew and his stupid fucking vending machine he bought on Craigslist that didn't work. He spent three grand on it, and basically went in debt for a piece of scrap metal.\n\nThe look on his face when he realized that his \"investment\" was worthless was so funny, I think I broke a rib cage laughing at it. He hated me for that, but I didn't care. We were so close. And we spent the whole Summer finding ways to use it. And honestly? That three grand was well spent.\n\nThose were the good times, doc.\n\nAll of those good thoughts and memories, plus a million more that swam in my clouded mind gave me that split-second indecision. Some of the things I remembered made the situation I was in feel slightly less damp. Slightly more bearable.\n\nBut my finger was on the trigger, see? And my mind was already set. It was like my head had given commands for it to push down, despite my pleading efforts for it to stop. I watched helplessly as it went down farther, and farther, and farther until...\n\n**BANG.**\n\nAnd let me tell you, it was so fucking loud. I still hear it in my ears sometimes.\n\nBut before anything else happened, I felt almost a push. It was sudden, and happened almost simultaneously with the shot, it was so quick I barely noticed it. But it happened, I know that as a fact.\n\nBut the tremor, the power of the gun was something I had never felt before. My ears rung so loudly it felt like my head was going to split open. My eyes stung with tears from the smoke, and my leg was on fire from the unexpected recoil. But I was alive... Somehow. With some hesitation, I felt around.\n\nFirst, I felt my face. Intact.\n\nThen I felt around my body, as I attempted to clear my eyes from the smoke. Also intact.\n\nNo blood. I wasn't dead.\n\nThe smoke dissipated after a few seconds, and I was able to look around the scene. The gun had fallen to the floor, with no sign of where the bullet went. I swear I didn't see it happen Doc. I didn't notice at first.\n\nBut I did look up at the ceiling eventually, at the trajectory of where the gun was pointed. That's when I saw where the bullet went. Above me, a wedding ring-sized hole ran through the plastered ceiling of the apartment... A ceiling that led to the bedroom floor of room directly above me.\n\nScreaming began. Horrible, horrible screaming.\n\nI remember fear racking my body, my fingers trembled so badly I could hardly dial 911. But I did.\n\nWhat happened next was a blur. Sirens, screaming, detainment, a visit from my livid ex-Girlfriend. It was a a living nightmare. I'm sure you understand, Doc. You probably go through a million cases like this a day. You get it.\n\nBit it wasn't until after the third questioning, when I was able to piece the story together on my own. They told me I flinched hard enough while pulling the trigger that the bullet managed to barely miss my head. Then, I guess it flew straight through the ceiling, and into the back of my upstairs' forty-year old neighbor, Rebecca. They told me she died minutes after impact.\n\nI was a murderer, Doc. A fucking killer. I couldn't process what was happening.\n\nBut deep down, in the back of my head, during the endless questionings and talks with my attorney, I was strangely relived, though. Weirdly relieved.\n\nI was almost glad it was her, instead of me, you see? And I know that's fucked up, you don't have to tell me.\n\nAlso, I felt like something had saved me. And I can't shake that feeling. Something had pushed me out of death's way, and it sure as hell wasn't me. It's kind of funny how you can go from wanting to die more then anything, to being glad you're alive after a botched suicide. Life is a big, long, cruel joke, right? Ha.\n\nAnyway, initially, I was charged with third-degree murder, but the charges were eventually dropped after the family urged the state not to pursue the case. The Robinson's were devout Catholics, and believed in my 'redemption' and 'reconciliation' with God or whatever. They reminded me that 'my guardian angel was watching over me that day, so I must be watching over it to'.\n\nI was never religious guy, so it flew over my head. But I have been thinking about those words recently. They also said something about the devil finally getting to Rebecca, which did sting me a little, I admit.\n\nI was grateful that they forgave me, and pleaded on my behalf, but I still never felt the remorse I should have for them, or Rebecca. It was like I really didn't care that much, and that scares me. It was clear to the prosecutor's that I had no motive, or malice when I shot the gun. Everything stacked up in my favor legally. But still, I just feel... You understand? Right?\n\nWell anyway, despite this, I was sent to rehabilitation, to you, Doc. And my rights to own a gun were revoked for the next 15 years, or until I could get a proper psyche test for my mental wellbeing. But that was to be expected. I didn't really care. I was just glad to be alive. Still am, actually.\n\nBut one thing I remember vividly out of the whole blur of the situation, was the day I was released. I was walking out of the detention center to start rebuilding my fractured life, papers in one hand and a lukewarm coffee in the other, when suddenly, I felt a warm breeze blowing on my shoulder. Then I felt a light push. It was strong enough to knock me to my feat, right before I got past the sidewalk to the road.\n\nI watched, flat on my ass, as a truck ran the red light through the crosswalk I was about to enter, blasting down the road mere inches away from my face. My adrenaline levels were a wreck after that, but I was alive.\n\nI heard on the news later that day, that the very same truck got in a crash. I heard there were no survivors.\n\nAnd doc? I just couldn't help but smile.\n\nMaybe I did have a guardian angel on my side, after all.\"\n\n*End log*",

        "text": " \n\nI was from the city. I had dreams of escaping the busy day to day shuffles of it all and always dreamed of living in a small town away from everything. After months of hunting and arguing with realtors, I found some property I wanted to call my own and start a new life with my son. It was a small farming town in Kansas with a population of around two-thousand people. It was perfect.\n\nI bought the land, packed me and my son Elijah's things in a U-Haul, and we made our journey to our new home. Looking back on it, he was more excited about it than I was. And I was pretty damn excited myself. Me and my sons escape from everything and to start a fresh new chapter in our new lives.\n\nMy son was just coming up on nine years old, his new school was close to our new farm, and he didn't have many friends in the city, so I knew the move was going to be good for him. His mother, my wife, passed away when he was at an early age due to an illness, so I was filling in as both parents. He was a pretty happy kid, though, always energetic and curious, just like his mother.\n\nThe farm I bought was called \"Crow's Rest.\" It was a couple acres filled with sweet corn that was already taller than me. A lot of it was ready to harvest, too, and I was excited to get started in our new venture. \n\nWhen I saw the layout online, I could only think, \"It's perfect.\" It wasn't too big, not too small either. The two story house on the property looked like it wasn't in bad shape either. Like someone recently fixed it up. The bank said the last owners just abandoned it out of nowhere, and I was able to get it for a steal. They said it's common for people to get overwhelmed by the high maintenance it takes to run a farm. I knew I was ready, though.\n\nAfter hours of driving across the states, we finally arrived at our new home. It was about noon when we arrived at Crows Rest for the first time. The way the fields and the house brightened in the countryside sunlight, it was beautiful. Elijah could barely contain himself in the passenger's seat when we pulled up, quickly pulling on the door handle, yelling and screaming in excitement. I was happy he liked it. Again, seeing him happy was worth it all to me.\n\nI parked the car, and he was already in the fields, running down the walking path wowing at it all. I also started making my way into the path, so I could finally scope it all out in person. One thing the photos didn't show was the number of crows on the property was overwhelming. They did forewarn me it wasn't just a name, crows seemed to gather here a lot, but there were double the amount than what they showed in the property photos. I didn't let it get to me, though. It was the least of our issues. I knew there would be a couple things they'd sneak past us.\n\n\"Dad, look over here!\" I heard Elijah yell in excitement. I made my way over to him to see what he was so excited about and what he was staring at.\n\nIt was a scarecrow. \n\nI walked up next to Elijah; he was so excited to see it. It was positioned on this tall wooden cross that hung over all the corn fields. Its arms were wrapped around the side's like it was nailed on to look like we were standing there, with its hands grasping the sides on the cross. \n\nI remember I thought then it looked eerie, to say the least. On our bright, happy new farm, This scarecrow was like a dark figure in it all. And it wasn't doing the best at its job, as crows rested on the cross with it and on top of its shoulders.\n\nAs I looked closely at its face, all I saw were stitches of eyes and a mouth with hay sticking out, with a noose necktie around its neck to hold its potato sack head. I look around its body. It wore hand-made clothes with little gaps of hay sticking out through the holes. The clothes were like farmer's clothes, but they were all darker shades from being dirty and worn. It wore a dark black trench coat that was worn out and ripped up near the bottom. It wore black boots, much like farm workers wear, with a toe box that looked like it had seen better days. \n\nAnd lastly, a dark sunhat on his head as the finishing touch. \n\nIt felt like it didn't fit in with the rest of the farm, but Elijah seemed to love him. \"Can I name him dad?! Please, Please!\" he said with excitement.\n\nI didn't wanna ruin his happiness with how off-putting the thing made me feel. What the heck, I thought. If he enjoyed it, I figured I'd suffer with the eye sore for him. \"Yeah, go ahead! Name it whatever you want.\"\n\nElijah thought on it for a bit. He looked around the farm and at all the crows. And then back at the scarecrow. \"Tobias, Traitor to all Crowkind!\" He said with such innocence in his voice. Honestly, giving it a name like that made it seem more or less eerie, weirdly enough. \"Tobias, it is then!\" With an arm around him, I said, \"Come on, let's get things unpacked and check out the new place.\" I said, directing him back toward the direction of the car. Crows cawing all around us as we made our way back.\n\nThe first couple of weeks were great. I started getting a handle on the whole farm life. Got all the equipment and tools we needed, some minor fix ups around the house and the barn, and even told Elijah soon we could start picking out some animals. Even made our way into town, getting to know a lot of the locals. Many of them had never even heard of Crow's Rest when I brought it up, which was strange to me with how close to town it was. They were excited about the corn I was promising everyone, though. Everything was perfect until it all started happening all at once. \n\nI was working on the barn out back, on the opposite side of the crops, away from the house. I was giving it a fresh coat of paint that it desperately needed. When I heard Elijah in the fields, it was like he was talking to someone. Curious about it all, I yelled out to him, \"Who are you talkin' to, buddy?\"\n\nIt was quiet for a bit. I got worried, so I dropped my brushes and walked over to where the walkway that went through the field. \"Elijah?\" I said again, then he popped out from the crops, looking at me like he did something wrong and was scared to be in trouble. I tried to see what was the matter, \"What's up buddy, who were you talking to out here, the birds?\" I said jokingly, but he had a nervous face on him. \n\n\"I was talking to Tobias,\" he said, still nervously. I didn't think much of it, so I added to it. \n\n\"Oh yeah, what did Tobias have to say? Is he ready for some new clothes because his aren't looking so pleasant nowadays?\" I continued joking. As I was whipping some paint that got on my hands on my pants and started walking back toward the barn side.\n\n\"Tobias doesn't talk much; he just listens. He waved at me, so I waved back at him and asked how he was.\" Elijah said. It waved at him? It must have been the crow's movement, and he got it confused. Still, I didn't want him to think it could move. \n\n\"I don't think Tobias can't move, buddy. He is made of straw, after all-,\" Elijah interrupted me before I could finish, \"He does move, dad! I've seen it!\" he yelled out at me. I had no idea what he was talking about or how to even respond back to it. \"Are you sure, buddy? When did you see such a thing, or have I been missing something?\" I said, clearly arguing with my nine year old about if the scarecrow moved or not.\n\n\"Well, he waved at me, and he leaves his cross at night. I see him moving around the fields sometimes. And last night, he was standing in front of our house.\"\n\nMy heart stopped. What did he just say? \n\nThe other stuff I could let go to his wild imagination, but if he saw someone standing in front of our house, that's when it started to become alarming for me. \n\n\"Wait, you saw someone stand in front of our house last night? And you see people moving in the fields? Why haven't you told me any of this until now?\" Elijah looked nervous like he was in trouble for not mentioning it sooner, but this was concerning. I tried to level with him on it.\n\n\"Hey, you're not in trouble, But things like this I gotta know about, buddy. We can't have people running around our property. It's not safe.\" I tried reassuring him if someone was stalking around the farm at night. I wanted to know about it. I'm glad he told me now so I can keep more of an eye out. \n\n\"It's not people though dad, It's Tobias.\" Again he tries to tell me it's the scarecrow, which in reality, was probably better he thought that than it being a person. I didn't wanna argue with him and upset him, so I dropped it for now.\n\n\"Okay, let's call it a day and get some dinner ready.\" I put my arm around him, looking around our fields as we started to head back to the house. Looking at Tobias hanging there before heading out of the fields.\n\nThat night after dinner, I put Elijah to bed and was on my computer working for a bit. I still worked from home remotely even though we're doing the farm now, just to make sure we had some cash flow still, and I'd stay up at night finishing the work pretty late, usually to about midnight. \n\nThat night I kept thinking about what Elijah said about people in our fields. It concerned me, so I figured I'd report it to the local authorities in the morning just to have it documented. It was probably just some local kids playing in our fields, if anything.\n\nThen I heard something outside. It sounded like slow trotting footsteps right outside on the other side of the wall where I was sitting.\n\nI froze. There really was someone outside. \n\nWhat should I do? I remember thinking, I didn't even own a gun yet, honestly didn't think I'd need one. I slowly started to get up out of my chair and quickly made it over to the lamp to turn out the lights.\n\nI wanted to make the room as dark as possible, so I could maybe sneak a peek out the window to see what it was before it could see me.\n\nI heard the slow walking thud of whatever it was still, but it wasn't in the vision of the window corner I was peeking out of yet. \n\nI could feel my heart pounding, nervously waiting to see whatever was just freely walking our property. Hoping it was just some animal. \n\nThen I heard something, very quietly, I heard words.\n\n\"You're not...real....\"\n\n\"Follow my…voice...I can...help…you..\"\n\n\"It's just...story...\"\n\n\"Lost in…the dark....All…alone...\"\n\n\"Let me…in....it's here...let me…in..\"\n\nIt was like broken sentences, with long pauses in-between them. It said these things with a rustic, whistling like voice. \n\nNo doubt about it now, someone was outside just freely walking our property. Hearing the voices only made me angrier honestly, I refused to let someone just freely walk our property. \n\nI finally gathered the courage up, grabbed a baseball bat I had downstairs, and started to make it to the front door. I swung it open and ran to the side of the house facing the fields, where I swore I heard the footsteps. \n\nI saw nothing. \n\nAll I could hear now was the wind blowing and the crops swaying back and forth. \n\nI was so confused. I know I heard something. The night sky was clear, so I could see around me, but not well enough to look for people's footprints. I didn't know what to do. \n\nThen suddenly, loud crashing started, like something was knocking over plates, photo frames off the walls, and even the chairs. \n\nIt's inside my house; whatever it is, it was in my damn house. It must have snuck through the front when I came outside. My heart dropped. How could I be so careless? \n\nOh my god, Elijah! I panicked. I quickly bolted back to the front of the house, going through the front door. It looked like someone had let a rampaging bull into our home. Everything was knocked over and smashed on the ground. Glass was shattered all over the kitchen floor.\n\nI was trying to move around to avoid stepping on any glass. I started hearing the rustic whistling voice again. Only this time, it was yelling violently. Screeching more words throughout my house.\n\n\"Down the lane!...Through the field!...I hear crows!... Don't open your eyes!\"\n\nI made it past the kitchen, scrabbling to make it to the stairway as fast as I could. Whatever this thing was, it was upstairs, rampaging around. I had to get to Elijah as fast as possible. It continued to scream things upstairs as it was moving around like it was looking for something.\n\n\"Olivia!...Hide!...It's coming...Olivia!..\"\n\n\"You're not...real!...Monster!....\"\n\n\"Help me!...Open the...Keep running...It won't die!\"\n\nEverything it was saying didn't make sense, like fragments of sentences. But every word held weight to them. Its voice was terrifying whatever it was. I knew it couldn't be human after hearing it scream.\n\nI made it to the top of the steps, hearing a blood curtailing scream from Elijah in his room. \"Daddy, help! It's gonna get me-...\" he said in a tone that had pure terror behind every word. \n\nI push off into the hallway. The sides of the walls have holes and claw marks all up the sides like something was pulling its way through the walkway. The door to his room was ripped off and hanging against the wall in the hallway. A loud crash, like broken glass, came from his room.\n\nI finally turned into his room to see no one there. I looked around in a frenzied panic. His room was destroyed like it ran around fighting to grab him. I screamed out for him, \"Elijah! Where are you!\" \n\nI heard him scream again. I noticed Elijah's window was broken open like something busted through it and had jumped out. \n\nI rushed over and looked out, broken glass on the ground below, and then I saw him. \n\nSomething dragging my son from behind into the fields as he continued to scream out for me. Disappearing into the field, only able to see the corn parting from above as they moved deeper into the thick of it.\n\nI turned around, making it back downstairs and outside, bolting into the direction of the fields where he was getting dragged off too. Every chance I could, I screamed out for him more. \n\nElijah's screams echoed through the night as it dragged him through the corn fields. \n\nMy baby boy, begging for his daddy's help as it pulled him deeper into the fields with its rustic screeching howled through the night. \n\nI was helpless to protect him. Unable to do anything for him, I couldn't match its speed. It moved so fluently through the field as the crows above blanked the skies like they were its servants. Watching me helplessly trail behind them. Squawking and screaming at me as I pushed past the tall corn stalks, trying to keep close. \n\nElijah's faint screaming led me toward where it was taking him. I felt so helpless. Tears started to river down my face. I lost his mother, and now I'm gonna lose my boy. I swore I would look after him, honey. \n\nHis screams eventually stopped, but I continued mine, hoping to hear back from him and to let him know daddy was coming. I pushed past out of the field into one of our path clearings in between the crops. \n\nThere he was. Elijah was lying there, he was cut up, but he looked okay. Relief started to overtake me. I started to run towards him. Once in my embrace, nothing would take him from me.\n\nHe was lying on his side, slowly getting up like whatever had dropped him had gone deeper into the crops. He looked up at me, crying and terrified. He screamed, \"Dad help me! Get me out of here, please.\" He started to stand now, \"I'm so scared.\" while tears were streaming down his face.\n\n\"I'm coming, buddy. It's gonna be okay. You're safe now.\" As I got closer to him, I felt better as I was about to scoop him up in my arms and get him out of there. Away from whatever hell this is. \n\nRight when I got close enough, what looked like eight silhouettes of hands reached out from the crops. Grabbing onto him violently before I could. Plunging him into the fields, dragging him across the ground back into the thickness of the corn stalk again. \n\nHe instantly screamed out to me with his surprised shock. Only this time, our eyes were locked together as he got dragged into the crop. \"Elijah, no! Grab my hand!\" I screamed out, as all the hopeful feelings I felt being so close to him got ripped again right in front of my eyes. \n\nI followed behind him, reaching out to try and grab his hand. But It wasn't enough, every attempt failing, just barely missing his touch. \n\nThen the thick of the corn stalk was no more. The area was all laid down like it was a small crop circle.\n\nThe sky above was nearly blacked out from the swarm of swirling crows overhead. But I could finally see the thing that was taking my son in the bit of moonlight that peaked through.\n\nIt was Tobias. \n\nThe scarecrow was alive; Elijah was right. \n\nI felt ineffable fear as I watched this thing. It leaned back as its chest was ripped open, with what I only could describe as shadows coming from its chest. \n\nFormulating what looked like over twenty silhouettes of hands grabbing and wrapping around Elijah. Some flailed around frantically, moving so inhuman. Grasping at the air, some grabbing at the ground, while the other half wrapped around Elijah.\n\nOne of the hands now reached out, covering his mouth as it muffled his screams. I didn't know what to do as it screamed out another rustic saying.\n\n\"Tobias....can't move!....he is made...of straw!...\"\n\nWith tears streaming down his face, Elijah held his hand out toward me. The hands slowly wrapped and warped around him, pulling him into the eternal void of its chest.\n\nHe slowly disappeared inside the void in its chest until only his arm was hanging out, eventually being fully pulled in.\n\nAfter consuming him, all the hands went back inside it. Its chest started sewing itself back up as it leaned forward, now hunched over. I was in a coma of fear as I watched it. I couldn't move a single muscle in my body.\n\nThe only noise now was the crows overhead, squawking and flying in circles around us. The scarecrow twitched every couple of seconds. It slowly began to move again. Looking up toward me, staring into my soul with its sewn together face. It said one final thing that night.\n\n\"... it's just...a Scarecrow... Don't be...Afraid...\"\n\nThere was calm still after that, then it let out another rustic scream that pierced through the night sky, sending all the crows flying in different directions. \n\nI couldn't fight this thing. This had to be some embodiment of a living nightmare.\n\nAdrenaline pumping through me, I bolt backward. Out of the clearing onto the trail heading back to the house, it pushed out of the crops falling over as it chased in the direction I was running. Quickly recovering and crawling after me on all fours like some animal.\n\nI looked back at it. The silhouettes of all the hands had returned, flailing around its body. They moved like snakes in different directions frantically around its body. It used them to grab the ground and move faster toward me, screaming its rustic howl as it chased after me.\n\nI turned the corner where the barn was, and the final pathway stretched to the front of the house and the truck. \n\nIt was toying with me, screaming from behind me, still howling its rustic screech into the night sky as it crawled behind me. \n\nIt's like it wanted me to feel hopeful like I could escape before it took me. Like before when it took… I just kept running. \n\nI made it back to the front of the house and headed to my truck. I kept a spare key inside it and left it unlocked that night, thank god. I jumped in, locked it, and turned it on. \n\nThe headlights flashed in front of me, but I didn't see anything. I quickly put it in reverse and wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. \n\nMy heart was pounding, and tears rolled down my face. I was unable to protect him. Feeling I should have done more, but facing this thing felt like suicide. I just want my son back.\n\nAs soon as I started to back up, it landed on the front of my truck, smashing the windshield on its landing. Its serpent-like silhouetted arms were now wrapped around the front of the truck. \n\nIts face was inches away from mine, the cracked windshield being the only barrier between us. It's like it was looking deep inside my soul with its demonic sewn together eyes. \n\nIt let out another scream, its mouth pulling down as the stitched sewing was holding it. The scream was so powerful it looked like it was about to rip the stitching.\n\nI quickly put the truck back in drive and floored it, moving towards the cornfield and slamming on the brakes. The creature flew off the front of the truck from the force and fell to the ground. \n\nI watched it scramble on the ground and look back up at me. It tilted its head and started to lunge toward the truck again.\n\nI then floored it again, running over it with my truck. As I did, I heard its rustic cry's into the night. \n\nI quickly put my car in reverse and ran back over it. Again, it cried out a high pitch screech. \n\nI started yelling back at it now, feeling like I was hurting it like it hurt me.\n\nI repeated this motion over and over again. I wanted to kill it for ripping everything from me.\n\nFinally, I reversed enough to have my headlights as a spotlight on it as it lay there. I didn't wanna leave, but I rolled over it so many times. Eventually, I drove to the sheriff's station as fast as I could to report everything that had happened.\n\nWhen we returned to the scene, the scarecrow wasn't there. \n\nThey didn't believe anything I said about what had happened that night, either. \n\nI mean, how could I blame them? Everything that unfolded sounded like some bad dream. They saw the state of the house and asked me again if there were some details I may have been missing out on.\n\nThey even questioned me, and I'm still under investigation, thinking I played some part in this.\n\nThey themselves said a lot was unexplainable, but the case is still open to this day on my son's disappearance. I still hear its rustic voice mimicking my words in my head at night. \n\nI know what I saw and what took him. And It's still out there.",

        "text": "I moved to Hickleover recently. Everyone called it a gated community, but I didn’t mind, I felt it was good for people like myself to mix with others. Yes, we didn’t have a lot in common on the surface, but life would be so boring if all of us were the same. \n\nMy neighbour was a lovely fella for the most part. Our early exchange was a little awkward but that was totally fine; I was an open book and happy for people to ask me anything they liked, really.  \n\n“Welcome to the neighbourhood, I’m George!” he said, with a beaming smile accompanied by a box of Celebrations, which was thoughtful.  \n\nHe was an imposing man, a very large figure to be polite. He could run through me; I giggled on the inside.  \n\n“Thank you very much! You can call me Abhi, everyone finds it easier.” \n\n“Hahahaha, oh yes, not to worry, Dev used to say the same thing,” George cackled. \n\n“So, what’s it like around here?”  \n\n“We’re a close-knit community, everyone is very friendly. Never had any serious problems in our area, there was a thing which happened with Dev...” George held his tongue as his eyebrows made a triangle shape.  \n\n“Sorry, what happened?”  \n\n“Hu Ha Hah, oh nothing much really. On Dev, he’s not around anymore but he was a good lad, you remind me a bit of him.”  \n\n“OK...that’s great, I suppose. It’s almost sunset, I best get going, don’t want to miss prayer,” I said, slightly bemused.   \n\n“Carry on Abhi ahaha, nice to meet you. I have a prayer this Sunday if you care to join?” \n\n“Oh, sorry. I’m not...” \n\nGeorge seemed to be taken aback a little, his smile wasn’t there anymore and he just looked at me intently with his expanded, fish-like eyes. I didn’t want to come across as the sort of guy who wasn’t integrating.  \n\n“But you know what George, it’s alright. I’ll come, it’s great to experience different faiths,” I said.  \n\n“That’s fine, no pressure ahaha but it'll be great to see you there. Take care anyways, good luck with the prayers!” \n\n“See you around” I smiled.  \n\n\\*\\*\\* \n\nThat evening, as I sat on my brand-new Chesterfield sofa, taking a sip from a can of Coke Zero, I digested my conversation with George and reflected a bit on the past. One may have thought what a guy like me was doing in a place like Hickleover, but I came from Little Heath.  \n\nIn Little Heath, the community was diverse, we tended to lock horns more often than not, but everyone had an understanding for each other. I came from a small family of three; my dad passed when I was young, and Mother raised me and Harry. We had to work hard from an early stage to support Mother, especially when she got sick. I did majority of the heavy lifting to be frank. While at university, I worked at the petrol station, and when I graduated, I’d retire from my day job and head to the depot to load parcels in a trailer all night.  \n\nHarry was a bum; while I scratched and clawed, he made excuses. We all faced some highs and lows, but I wouldn’t give up. Straight out of school, Harry messed up and never made much of an effort at college either. Soon, he briefly worked as a sales assistant in several supermarkets but was sacked due to laziness. For each failure, he cried racism; it was always because of how he looked or what he believed in and never him.  \n\nSometimes I thought it was partly due to the crowd he hung around with. His friend Mo was of a similar vein, barely held a job, smoked weed all day and spoke vividly of a number of conspiracy theories. \n\n“They wanna keep us down bro, they don’t like how we look! I swear, if I was white, I’d be a top shotta in them glass buildings bro,” Mo would say when he’d come over for Harry.  \n\nI’d desperately try to hold my laughter inside at his sheer stupidity and pressed a little as to why or how they “wanna keep us down”. Mo would reply, “They control the banks and governments bro, you’ve seen what’s happening around the world, divide and conqueror bro.” Harry shared the same views, and I just saw him and Mo as people with too much time on their hands. When Mother passed, I wasn’t going to let Harry lean on me anymore. I had enough, I had to get out.  \n\n\\*\\*\\* \n\nLater in the week, George had stopped by briefly to make sure I was ready to attend prayer with him on Sunday.  I wasn’t one to let people down, and before I knew it, Sunday had arrived. George gave my door a gentle knock, and I was out with excitement. After hopping in the car with George, we soon exchanged some pleasantries and started our journey towards some worship.  \n\n“Hey Abhi, many apologies for how we first met aha. It’s just that I’m very passionate about my beliefs and in fact I’m pretty fond of Coloureds,” he said.  \n\nI forced out a smile while thinking to myself, ‘Coloureds’? That wouldn’t go down too well in Little Heath, but surely George must’ve meant well. \n\n“Ah not to worry, we all get passionate at times. Speaking of your fondness, may I ask why you feel that way?” I asked. \n\n“Oh Abhi! My fondness goes beyond all of our species being one of the same, for she who gave us our daily bread, has promised us her glory through the promised one. The Mahdi, our dark knight,” he said.  \n\nSometimes such religious waffle made people seem a bit crazy, but that was a stereotype, and I found some common ground with George. Being a man of God and all.  \n\n“That’s very interesting, in my faith we believe in the Mahdi to. It is said that he will appear during the end of time and it will be a sign of triumph over evil in the world,” I said very seriously.  \n\nGeorge laughed a little and gave a nod before cautiously leaving a slip road. Then, there was a long period of quiet, and with me not being the earliest of birds, I took a nap which would end when I was awoken by the diesel engines clatter coming to an abrupt halt.  \n\nI opened my eyes, a little dazed. \n\n“Hey, George, are we here?” I asked.  \n\n“Oh yes, indeed aha, looks like you had some nice shut-eye.” \n\nThere was pitch black darkness outside, I could barely see much. The landscape was vast and covered in a sea of greenery. A pathway was sandwiched between two fields, with grass which was almost taller than me. \n\nAs we walked along the pathway, an unsettled gust of wind pressed against me and grew in strength. This was reinforced by an increasing rattling noise coming from the tall grass which danced with enthusiasm in the fields. \n\n“How long now George, couldn’t we have just driven directly to the place?” I asked, sounding a little disturbed.  \n\n“Our land is holy, Abhi. Each step we take on foot towards her glorification, is met with a great reward indeed. We are half a mile out; can you see the temple?” George said with eagerness.  \n\n“I think so...” \n\nI could feel the lens of my eyes expand as I stared hard in the distance. I could see an orange glow form a semi-circle around a rectangular building.  \n\nAs we got closer, I could see the temple better and unfortunately, smell it, too. It was a building with two storeys coated in a white paint and render which were peeling away. Of what remained on the windowless walls, mould sprayed the structure with darkness. As for its scent, it smelled like dung.  \n\nIt would appear that the light I had noticed earlier came from a number of hooded figures which were surrounding the temple whilst holding a flambeau. \n\n“Who are they George?”  \n\n“Family. I’ve known them my whole life. They are our brothers of true faith and the protectors of our holy grounds, be not afraid my friend,” he said.  \n\nI wasn’t afraid, but just found it a little odd. Interestingly, the ‘brothers’ knelt and formed a guard of honour as I approached the temple’s double-door. I didn’t know how to respond but I nodded at them.  \n\nInside, the temple was well lit and the setup looked rather ordinary. I didn’t visit the Church for obvious reasons, but remembered singing the Lord’s prayer in symphony at primary school. There would be an uproar if they made the kids do it these days.\n\nAnyway, the nave area had the usual long bench setup. But ahead of the pulpit, there was an altar table with what seemed like a hole in the centre.  \n\n“The temple is very pleasant, George, very excited to learn more.” \n\n“That you will my friend. Please take a seat here in the front row and we shall begin very shortly.” \n\nAs I got more comfortable, the brothers swarmed in and filled the nave area in seconds. On my row, I was sat on the edge. As each brother passed me, they gave a firm handshake with both hands and bowed slightly. I felt very special.  \n\nI know I mentioned the awful smell of the building while we were outside, and maybe it was cow manure or animal excrement in the fields which clouded the temple, but it was even worse on the inside.  \n\nGeorge stood behind the pulpit and started what appeared to be a sermon of some kind. \n\n“The grace of our saviour, and the love of the All-Mother, and the fellowship of our peoples, be with you all,” he said.  \n\n“She gave us bread and we gave her grace. She broke the bread, and provided it to our brothers and said, have this, my servants and eat it. For this is my being, which will be given up for you,” George said with inspiration. \n\nI was surprised by collective gasps in the audience. The “brother” next to me was very animated; he had leapt from the bench and cried, “Glory be to Nora!” \n\nGeorge continued. \n\n“When the feast was ended, she took the chalice. \n\nGave the chalice to our brothers and said, ‘Take this, all of you, and wash thy orifice’ \n\nThis is my sweat, the sweat of the eternal covenant.  \n\nThis will be released for you and for all servants who seek my forgiveness. \n\nDo this to honour me.” \n\nThe brother next to me began to ring a bell maniacally.  \n\nThen, everyone in the rows along the bench got up and began to form a queue towards the pulpit. \n\nI didn’t know what was happening while I was in the line as my view was blocked by a tall brother in front of me, but each person appeared to walk up to George as he said “Body of Nora”, each time.  \n\nAs I tried to get a glimpse from the sides of my line of sight, I could tell that when each person got to George, they seemed to face their back towards him and went into a crouching position. I began to feel a little nervous. \n\nSoon, I reached the front of the line and was shocked to find that the brother in front of me had pulled his trousers down...WTF? He casually bent over with his behind facing George. \n\nI couldn’t believe my eyes. George then walked over to the brother, holding a chalice. He spilled a few drops on the brother's arse as he said, “Body of Nora”, once again. It was so bizarre. The brother replied “Amen” and returned to the bench.   \n\nIt was my turn next. I was literally bricking it, and George sniggered. I saw the chalice in his hand, and it was letting off a steam. Whatever was in there was warm and made me hold my nose. \n\nI don’t know why, or how, but I began to slowly reach for the button around my waist. Before I knew it, my denim jeans were below my knees. My pride wouldn’t allow me to remove my boxers, and I stood there, crouched a little, like a gullible animal waiting to be slaughtered. It may sound a tad bit dramatic, but I never felt more humiliated.  \n\nGeorge approached me, and was static for what felt like an age. Was he whispering something? And then, pulling my shorts towards him, I felt a tiny stream of a gooey substance trickle down my crack and over my anus. At the same speed, I pulled my jeans back on and retreated to the bench, thanking God this bizarre custom was over, or so I thought.  \n\nWhen we returned to the bench, George made his way to the altar table. Standing before it, with his arms stretched out in welcome, he began a chant, which went something like “huuuu haaaaaah, huuuuuu haaaaa, huuuuuuu haaaaaaah”. It seemed to increase with magnitude and I could no longer see the pupils of George’s eyes. They were plain white, and it appeared he was having an out-of-body experience.  \n\nAt this point, my eyes were filled with utter disgust as I saw each brother, one-by-one, take turns sitting on the altar table with their trousers down. I couldn’t believe it; they were taking a fucking shit! There was someone who seemed to be struggling and in unison they all chanted “huuuuuuuuuuuuu” in one long gasp before exploding with “haaaah”. That sure helped him! \n\nAlthough the brothers had finished doing their business, I personally had no intention of taking a shit publicly. “What kind of sick fucks are these people?” I thought. I then approached George, and before I could whisper silently of my withdrawal in their ritual, he spoke to me. His eyebrows were no longer raised and the pupils of his eyes had returned.  \n\n“Oh, Abhi my friend, patience!! Hahaha, I love your dedication. Don’t you worry, your time will come. For the greatest offerings are those which come from the Coloureds,” he said.  \n\n“I wasn’t going to...”  \n\nGeorge interrupted me. \n\n“For in the name of the All-Mother, the prophecy of our Mahdi will be most complete, she will be honoured, and it will be a joyous celebration,” he said. I was fed-up with this strange man. His waffle made little sense to me, and I needed answers.  \n\nJust as I was about to use my last drop of energy to question George, I heard a loud wail from somewhere in the temple. Or was it outside? I tried to listen intently, but it lasted less than a couple of seconds.  \n\nAll the brothers were looking at me as I power-walked to the exit.  \n\nOpening the entrance door, I looked out along the path which led to the temple and the fields which surrounded us. There was nothing to be seen or heard.  \n\nI wanted to go home.  \n\nAs I turned around to return inside the foul building, I was startled by George who was standing right behind me.  \n\n“Did you hear that, George?”  \n\n“Hear what Abhi?”  \n\n“That loud cry, it seemed like it came from somewhere close by,” I said, surprised. \n\n“Oh, forgive me my friend, my ears do not deceive me. I think you are in need of a feast and some well-deserved rest,” George said, his expression unchanged.  \n\nIt was staggering to see him deny what was abundantly clear to me, and it just added to my increasing confusion. It was best I got out as soon as possible.  \n\n“Not to worry George, I must be on my way soon, when do you intend to finish from here?” I spoke. \n\n“We intend to remain in the holy grounds tonight, and at dawn, we shall begin our pilgrimage to the Cave of Nora to reinforce our oneness in her. Please, join us in our spiritual struggle. The brothers are expecting you,” he said \n\nAfter my experiences, I had my reservations. Did I have much of a choice though, seeing I arrived with George and all?  \n\nI politely requested to be excused from their feast as I was very tired and wanted some space. I always carried some snacks on me given my own dietary requirements, so it was never a bother.  \n\nGeorge took me up a darkened staircase to the first floor that hadn’t responded well to decay and rot. It made me feel uneasy, and I wondered if Dev had been here before.  \n\nWe made it to the top. There was a long hallway which was stuffed between multiple rooms on each side; I assumed this was where the brothers must have rested. Amid the increasing gloom, I noticed a shine at the end of the hallway. As I moved closer, I could see that it was a door which had been painted in a bloody red.  \n\n“Seems like a fancy room George, I bet it’s for you,” I joked. \n\n“Ah yes, they all say that first ha ha hah. It’s the red isn’t it? Stands out. We use the red room for special prayers. Please refrain from entering,” he said. \n\nNot that I was going to, anyway, but I found it odd that he asked me not to enter the ‘red room’. George then showed me my accommodation, if I could call it that. We entered the first room to our right, and immediately, I shivered because there was a drastic shift in the temperature. \n\nIt was chilly inside the room, and I could barely make out the large silhouette before me. George startled me by setting a candle, bringing that ballooning smile to light which gave me a minor fright.  \n\nWhile it was still difficult to see effectively, the dim light in the room showcased a small table and a single bed. They were the only pieces of furniture I could make out. The wallpaper was peeling away, there were cracks in the walls, and patches of forest green were smeared on the floorboards which creaked with each step I took.  \n\nWorst of all, the foul smell from when I first entered the place was heightened, and I couldn't open any windows either! I puked a little on the inside entertaining the origin of the stench which stained my very soul.  \n\n“Rest well friend. I will bring you breakfast in the morning, and then we shall rejoice in pilgrimage,” George said.  \n\n“Ah, thank you. Too kind,” I said, slightly bitter by the state of the room.  \n\nI couldn’t help but feel a sense of uneasiness as George left. I decided to lay on the bed, but seconds later my backside was attacked by very rigid floorboards. A revolting odour hit me harder at the same time. It seemed like a prank at first and I was furious, can’t I relax even for a moment? \n\nI pushed myself out and, instinctively, pulled the bedsheets away. That forest green patch I had seen around the room was deeper in the hole within the bed. I retreated in disgust and fell to the floor. \n\nI never felt more alone and broke down in tears. I asked myself, “what am I even doing here? And in God’s name where have I come?”  \n\nAfter calming myself, I found a corner in the room which was reasonably clean. I could finally have a lie down, and Snickers never tasted better to me. What a relief.  \n\nIt may have been well past twilight when I must have dosed off into a half-sleep, which was interrupted with a nightmare.  \n\nMy adrenaline-boosted inquisitiveness had me standing in the hallway outside in seconds. I walked slowly towards the red room. Each step made a groan with an echo at the end which stretched all the way down. The sounds were somewhat acceptable within the confines of my room.  \n\nWalking down the hallway, my uneasiness had elevated. I was about half way down when I started to hear the familiar, “huuuuuuuuh, haaaaaaaah” chant; it seemed to grow louder the closer I got to the door.   \n\nThere was an oval-shaped brass backplate with a standard keyhole; the doorknob was made from glass which had darkened. I turned the doorknob which felt rather loose, and the door unlocked with anticipation. I opened it, just a crack, and could just about make out what was inside. \n\nI saw no one and there was no furniture at all in the room. I took note of some candles in the centre of the room which had been laid out in a small circle; they made the oak flooring shine like gold. The room was wide enough for two big double beds, and the plain white wallpaper made the room appear bigger than it was.  \n\nA dark and narrow shadow startled me. It interrupted the glow from the oak flooring. It had been cast from my opening of the door. Breathing a little sigh of relief, I decided to enter the room. My footsteps, barely made a sound. \n\nAs I approached the centre of the room, I could see the candles enclosed a square trap door which had been embedded into the flooring. Standing directly above it, I could hear faint chanting. I soon found myself pulling on the black handle of the trap door. \n\nThere was a ladder, which I began to climb down. I could barely see what was beneath me; I was in a pit of gloom. As I climbed down, further and further, the chanting was getting louder, “huuuuuuu, haaaaaaaaah!”  \n\nI felt a chill down my spine.  \n\nAfter what felt like twenty minutes, I reached the bottom. I turned my back and saw a tunnel. It was pitch black as I walked, and the harmonious voices were beating on my eardrums.  \n\nThe smell of excrement was profound, and it intensified my laboured breathing. After fifteen meters or so, there was a bright gold sparkle. The instant I saw this, the chanting had stopped. I felt like all their eyes were on me. As I got closer, I saw a circular enclosure at the end of the tunnel. There were hooded brothers on each side holding a flambeau, they were all looking in my direction. In the centre of the enclosure, was an altar table which sparkled; it was made from gold and contained an opening full of strangely shaped jewels and emblems of varying colour.  \n\nThere was someone sitting upright on the altar table. It seemed as though he, or she, was covered in a white sheet which was covered in blood. The stains were focussed in two regions: below the waist and close to the neck or head, which I was unable to make out.  \n\nMy horror was momentarily distracted by a nude woman who stood just ahead of the altar table. Her skin was pale as snow and her hair was long, thin and black. She wore no expression, and the red dilated pupils of her eyes hypnotised me. I couldn’t help but feel drawn towards her.  \n\nI got closer and realised she was holding something; it was the severed head of an olive-skinned man.  \n\n\\*\\*\\* \n\nI awoke in a cold sweat, and my body was shaking uncontrollably, I didn’t remember much else besides the feeling of being paralysed with agitation. Just as I managed to calm myself, I heard a knock on the door.  \n\n“Good morning, Abhi, I come bearing fruits, faithfully!” George said.  \n\nI hadn’t seen George so happy since we first met, and he couldn’t stop grinning. Wiggling his hips and on his toes, he jiggled his way into my room with a trolley.  \n\n“I hope this will suit your delicacies!” he added, while unveiling the breakfast he had bought me.  \n\nMy eyes were swarmed with dazzling colours. There were raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, two bowls of bran flakes, multigrain bread, peanut butter, milk and some fresh orange juice.  \n\n“Many thanks George! This is too much!” I said, as my stomach began to make a ‘BRAAP’ sound.  \n\nMy lips were so dry, and I didn’t wait for George to leave. I went for the orange juice first and downed a whole glass instantly, then I took two handfuls of berries and chucked them in my mouth.  \n\nI then let out a huge burp. \n\n“Excuse me,” I said.  \n\n“No no, aha, please continue. You must be so hungry. I will receive you shortly after breakfast, and you may join us in pilgrimage,” he said.  \n\n“Sure, we’re going to the Cave of Nora right? How far is it from here?” I asked. \n\n“It’s right here Abhi, the journey will be most comforting and a great reward is promised,” George said. \n\nWhen he said the Cave was right here, a small piece of multigrain toast fell out my mouth, and I bit my tongue.  \n\n“What do you mean right here?” \n\n“You shall see my friend.” \n\nGeorge smiled and left the room. \n\nIt was the best breakfast that I’d had in some time, yet my apprehension did not ease. I had hoped it would all be over soon, and I would find myself in the warmth of my bed, hot chocolate on my bedside table, and a book in my hand. I don’t like judging or making any generalisations, but I’d rid myself from these strange people and their bizarre practices.  \n\nIt wasn’t long before George came to get me. He barely spoke a word. In a trance, I found myself at the foot of the red room. George turned the doorknob; it was made from glass and had seen better days. The door opened with ease, and the glare from the wooden oak beneath me was blinding.  \n\nI refocused my eyes by blinking a few times and then saw candles in the centre of the room in a circle. There was a trap door in the centre. George pulled on the handle, and we both began to climb down, I could barely see him beneath me and the sound of his feet clanging on the ladder’s metal wasn’t comforting, nor was the indistinct chanting in the distance which seemed to become less audible the further we went below.  \n\nIt wasn’t easy climbing down; I felt a little groggy and fatigued. My mental deprivation forced me to block out how terrified I was. Compulsion was driving me.  \n\nSoon I was at the bottom of the uninviting pit. It was far too muted.  \n\nAnd there I found a long passage.  \n\nGeorge pressed forward, and I couldn’t help it as I followed him into the black hole before me. It all felt familiar, as though I’d been here before or maybe the universe was trying to decode a message for me.  \n\nI kept pinching my nose due to the foul smell coming from the walls and the depths of the tunnel. It was not something I’d ever get used to in a place like that, but it was the least of my concern. My disintegrating mind made me forget how repulsive the smell was around me, and the thing which made me forget the state of my mind, was fear.  \n\nDeep into the darkness, my vision was temporarily blurred by a growing speck of light. I could make out an enclosure as the tunnel began to widen a touch. I began to walk a little slower. George, noticing this, encouraged me to walk in front of him. I then stalled a little when I was close enough to see an altar table. It illuminated the front half of the enclosure with its gold plating and embedded jewels. I could not see much before me, and the silence punctured my soul. The air was getting colder, and it compounded my anxiety.   \n\nI must have walked another five meters when I began to make out someone sat on the altar table. It appeared to be a man in his late twenties. He wore nothing but some boxer shorts which seemed to be covered partly in blood. His mouth was taped, and his familiar eyes evoked a terrible tale of crippling misery.  \n\nIt was Harry, my brother.  \n\nHis muffled screams for help broke me. At one point, the tape on his mouth became a little loose, and I could make out what he was saying. \n\n“I can’t shit bro, FFS! Let me go! I am fucking constipated!”  \n\n He carried on, “I pledge allegiance to the New World Order and the Lord of Darkness! Please leave me!” By then, George had managed to get to him and put the tape back on. \n\nI felt my feet glued to the floor as a tsunami of emotions came over me. Why play such a mortifying trick? \n\nI came out of my shock when I saw George bowing to something in the darkness behind Harry. Each step it took forward echoed through the tunnel, and I felt the resonance in my spirit as it came out the shadows.  \n\nIt had a medium build and wasn’t taller than five foot ten. It had long, thin hands which stretched to its waist, its fingernails were pointed, and I noticed how both hands were missing a thumb. It wore no fabric, and its dark skin was tough.  \n\nIt looked at me with its dark red eyes. There was no iris or pupil, just unadulterated evil.  \n\nIt smirked at me with teeth which could do more than tear and rip food apart.  \n\nIt pointed at me and then Harry, who had finally come to the realisation of my presence.   \n\nHis cries grew louder, and he didn’t have the tape on anymore. \n\n“Abhi! Is that you? Are you real?” he asked, clearly petrified.  \n\nI couldn’t find the words; I was completely pulverized with terror. \n\n“Don’t leave me!” he shrieked.  \n\n“I’m sorry, I love you!” I cried.  \n\nWith tears streaming down my face, I turned around and ran faster than I had ever done before. Harry screamed even louder, and I could hear him curse me as we separated.  \n\nHis cries would come to a sudden halt.  \n\nIt pierced my heart, but I did not look back.  \n\n\\* \\* \\*",

        "text": "What is love? That's a question I've always wondered. I mean, you see love in the movies. It's always so sweet and cutesy and romantic, where the guy always gets the girl. But does life actually work like that?\n\nAbsolutely fucking not.\n\nSome of you may ask, \"well, how do you possibly know this?\" I know this because it's what the book told me.\n\nThe book itself is a beautifully strange concept. From what I can read, it always finds it's way to desperate in their moment of need, and always seems to help. How does it do this? I have no clue. But, I mean, it also did the same to me, and the universe works in weird ways, so why shouldn't it work like this? It makes sense in a way.\n\nI came into possession of this book - well, I should say really, the book came into possession of me approximately 2 months ago in my haven, a little place called wilkins. \n\nI was meandering down the dimly-lit isles of my local bookstore, mahogany shelves on either side holding me close in a protective embrace between them. I could feel the tips of my fingers gently trace across the spines of the novels, feeling each book shiver beneath my cold touch. With every shiver and stretch, a small cloud of dust was released, free from previously being bound within fragile pages. The musty smell that it let off wasn't a bad scent necessarily, but it takes a very niche person to appreciate the stories and history that these books excrete. \n\nVery few people I knew were able to appreciate this, so it was mostly just me wandering these halls alone. I didn't mind that though, in a way it was very peaceful - it was a nice place to unwind. The store was mostly deserted, quiet enough that the sound of your heartbeat would be echoing down the isles. Though, sometimes i saw old man joe stocking the shelves, but with a polite smile and curt?? nod, we both went on our individual paths through this ___ maze. I'd rather not have any more interaction with him then this - the way his dark eyes stares directly into my soul unnerves me a bit.\n\nAlso I occasionally see another woman, I don't know her name but I liked to call her Elle, like Elle woods. She couldn't have been more than 23, always clad in the same pink leather miniskirt and matching tube top, a white fur coat slung around her shoulders. Honestly, I have no clue what she would be doing in a place like this, but with Joe's age, his eyesight isn't what it once was, meaning he occasionally makes some very expensive books very cheap. I assume elle is here looking for some cheap textbooks - I don't blame the girl, some of those books can go for a couple of hundred second-hand. I really don't see the point of professors requiring them, but oh well. When Elle saw me, she always gave me a bright smile, which always seemed to make my day a little better. Elle deserves to be in a better place than this.\n\nThose were the only two people I regularly saw. Although, every once in a while a curious tourist popped their head in or a young family came to ask for directions after they got lost, but nobody else really stuck around. It always got me wondering how Joe earnt enough money to keep the shop up and running - but oh well, that's none of my business really.\n\nAh yes, back to the book.\n\nI found it one rainy December afternoon. I walked into the store as I normally do, the small little bell on the frame chiming, announcing my entrance to old joe. As I shook my umbrella off and put it in the stand wooden stand next to Joe's desk, something on the counter caught my attention. It was a small, hardback journal - like the ones crafted in the 1800's, and you could still see the delicate stitchwork keeping all the pages trapped together rather than flying around the room. I traced my finger along the spine, wiping away a thin layer of dust to read ara me in small gold italics. I looked over the side and front in search of a price tag, wiping away dust as I did so. I flipped the book over to its back, and fully checked over it again, but there was still no price tag in sight.\n\n\"Joe?\" I called out into the abyss of bookshelves, \"how much is the ara me book on your desk?\" \n\nAs much as I didn't like talking to the grumpy old bastard, he'd be the only person who knows how much it would be.\n\n\"It's free if you leave now and let me close on time for once!\" An angry voice groaned from within the ocean of literature.\n\nI felt my cheeks flush red - I did have a tendency to stay a little after closing, but this place seemed to have its own measurement of time. \n\n\"Okay okay, I'm leaving now, bye Joe!\" I hurriedly explained, grabbing both my book and umbrella. Once I heard a familiar grunt in return, I opened the door and stepped out into the petrichoric street and started to make my way home down the cobbled alleyway.\n\nLittle did I know, this day would fling my life to a whole new axis.",

        "text": "My roommate makes poor choices. I’ve driven him home from the hospital more than once and it’s usually because alcohol was involved. The story I was told so far by Chris’s friend was that they invited themselves to a party, rewarded each failed hookup with more beer, and Chris finally stumbled (possibly literally) into a woman as sloshed as he was. They both disappeared into someone’s bedroom and passed out. The visit to the hospital was done, not out of kindness, but because of the puddles left on the bedsheets and carpet.\n\n“Good morning, Elliote! We’ll have Christopher and Margaret out in a few minutes.” Heather smiled from inside the nurse’s station. \n\n“Thanks, Heather!” I replied and took a seat.\n\nIt doesn’t take too many trips to recognize people. I’m on a first name basis with some of the morning staff. This is what happens when your roommate doesn’t admit that his drinking brings us here far too often.\n\n“Buddy!” Chris said with arms spread for a hug. He looked like hell with red half-closed eyes.\n\n“Hey, Chris.” I regrettably accepted the hug. He smelled like he needed a bath. “Tell me all about last night on the way home.” I started to the door.\n\n“Okay, but don’t forget Maggy.”\n\n“She doesn’t have her own ride?”\n\nI turned around and saw her. She had long, dark hair styled in a rat’s nest that was messier on one side more than the other and smeared makeup on a face that could have graced a magazine cover with sharp features, a defined jawline, and a death stare at the world for the rude awakening. She wore an oversized shirt that was - without a doubt - produced from the lost and found box by a nurse that deemed her actual clothes too ripe with half-digested food. \n\n“Nope. We’re sleeping off the hangover in casa de us.” Chris said.\n\nI didn’t pay much attention to Chris’s recollection of the night. His stories are usually entertaining because of how he exaggerates everything. During the drive home, the overweight goblin-man getting together with America’s next top model was the more interesting mystery. I’ve lived with Chris long enough to know the kind of woman he’s able to bring home. He’s only after one-night stands. His dating pool is small and smaller when you consider his looks. Now, he’s sitting in the front passenger seat while Maggy sits alone in the back with her head resting on the window.\n\nI cracked the apartment curtains open before the fetch quest, so no one was in danger of stubbing toes, and I closed Chris’s bedroom curtains completely before going out. He said that he never got hangovers after being transported to the hospital, but he still appreciated my making the place ready for a long morning nap.\n\n“Enchante, Mags.” Chris opened the door to his bedroom. \n\n“No. I like to sleep alone.” She made his jaw drop. “Is there another free bed?”\n\n“Yeah, you can take mine.\" I said. \"Just let me grab my charger and I’ll be in the living room if you need me.” \n\nReally, I offered my bed to mess with Chris. He brings home the girl and I bring her to my bedroom. It’s not every day where you can steal the woman away from your “super seducer” roommate. It’s a joy to be the reason that he’s going to bed alone while I’m with the night’s “prize.” He smirked as we walked into my room together.\n\n“My friend will be here in a bit with my stuff,” she said.\n\n“Oh, I didn’t even notice you made a call. Does she know where the apartment is?”\n\n“He and don’t worry. Thanks for the bed.”\n\n“No problem, Maggy.”\n\n“Margaret. Names have power and I like people that say *mine* correctly.”\n\nI awkwardly retrieved my phone charger from the room while Margaret hopped into bed. I don’t know if it’s just me, but I couldn’t escape being aware of every spot of dust or untidy pile in the room because there’s someone new here. The room has never been as messy as Chris’s room. The worst messes here have been empty mugs or plastic bottles on the desk that I finished just before turning in for the night. \n\nAs I left the room, I looked at Margaret. She had her arms across her chest like she was being buried or Wednesday Addams was her childhood idol. I almost thought she died right on my bed given how shallow her breaths were.\n\nI lay on the couch and browsed Reddit to pass the time until Margaret’s friend stopped by. I don’t remember her pulling out her phone at all. Chris must have told her the address because I didn’t say exactly where we lived on the car ride. Maybe she’s broadcasting her location through an app on her phone and she just has to tell someone to grab her GPS coordinates.\n\nThere came a scratching at the door. Not knocking. Scratching.\n\nIt was strange, but Margaret was getting weirder the longer I’ve known her. Scratching at the door instead of knocking almost sounds normal. I opened the door, and there was a black cat wearing a backpack with a bedroll.\n\nI’m not a cat person, so the reaction wasn’t *Aww! Look at the kitty with his wittle backpack!* It was like feeling the gears in my brain grind to a halt. The cat meowed and walked past me, trying to process if this was the friend Margaret sent here. I watched it walk up to my bedroom door and sit. It meowed again.\n\n*Open the door, human. We both know you’re smart enough to connect the dots.*\n\nI twisted the knob, and the cat pushed the door open and squeezed in. I went back to the couch for a nap. Chris sure knows how to pick them. Margaret is absolutely gorgeous, but sleeps like she’s rehearsing her funeral and cats are making deliveries for her. Maybe the bedroll is a clean shirt to replace the lost and found one. \n\nThe cat woke me by batting my foot. I once had a dog that discovered he could do the same thing when he wanted to play. The cat wasn’t wearing his backpack anymore, and he looked at me again.\n\n*Get up, human. Margaret wants a word.*\n\nI sat up and looked at my bedroom. Margaret had the door open just wide enough that I could see half her face. She stared at me unblinking and made a come here gesture. What else could I do? I obliged and went into my room. She wore a fresh shirt that fit much better. \n\n“Do you need som…”\n\n“Do you drink?”\n\n“Not really, why?”\n\n“This is for Cristopher.” She pointed to a cardboard box next to my door. “It’s a craft beer made just for him. Don’t drink it.”\n\n“Okay. Did the cat…”\n\n“Not important. I’m leaving now before Christopher wakes up. Don’t drink the beer and take this.” She grabbed my hand and pressed a rough gemstone into it. “You could use this.”\n\nI tried to see what I was holding in the dimly lit room and didn’t get far. When I turned my focus back to Margaret, she was gone. I couldn’t have been staring at the gemstone for two seconds, and she walked right past me without noticing. \n\nI set the beer in front of Christopher’s door with a note saying Margaret left it for him before leaving. The curtains in my room are open now and I can identify that gemstone. I’m no geologist, but my best guess was rose quartz after some research. Margaret said I “could use it,” and I couldn’t find any practical uses. I did find it funny that witches use it for crystal magic. Witches would explain the black cat.\n\nThe loudest burp from Christopher stopped my research. I’ve heard noises from his room before, but this burp rattled the room. I stepped out to check on and congratulate him. You have to give adulations where they’re due, but I wanted to make sure he didn’t hurt himself.\n\n“Yo, Christopher! Was that you?” I noticed the beer was gone. Christopher didn’t respond. “Christopher?”\n\nThe apartment developed a strange vinegar-y smell that was coming from Christopher’s room. I approached the door and could hear him burping in there. I tried knocking on the door and calling his name again to no response. \n\nI opened the door slowly and the smell assaulted me. Christopher laid back in his armchair with five empty brown bottles on the floor while he was working on the sixth. His body was extremely bloated and looked like an overfilled water balloon. I watched as a bubble protruded from his belly, traveled up through his neck, and escaped with another burp. He finished the beer and looked at me.\n\n“Elly.” Another burp. “Can you hand me another beer?”\n\n“N.. No… I think you’ve had enough.”\n\n“Nonsense!” Burp. “We need to find Mags…” burp, “and get more of this stuff!”\n\nHe tried to reach down and grab another bottle from the case. I watched the liquid that filled him shift forward suddenly. It threw him off balance and he fell forward and popped. \n\nA mix of blood and beer and other viscera flowed across the room and the smell of vinegar fumigated the apartment. I staggered outside the apartment and into the hallway. My neighbors had gathered there already because of the smell. They learned where the smell was coming from real fast.",

        "text": "Liam, I wouldn’t have thought that this needed to be said, but I guess I was wrong.\n\nWhen you hear sharp scratching – the sound of claws on metal – coming from the inside of a vent, you do not, and, *I cannot stress this enough*, you do not open aforementioned vent and stick your head into that small, dark space to investigate.\n\nBest case scenario, a rat jumps onto your face. Worst case scenario, the next morning we find most of your body laying in a congealed pool of blood. We don’t even know where the rest of you is. \n\nWell, I think I might know, but I can’t bear to think about right now.\n\n*Goddamnit*, Liam. \n\nAfter he’d first been moved into the new building, Liam, my work buddy, told me over lunch about a sound he was hearing in his new temporary office that freaked him out. It sounded like there was something moving around in the vent.\n\n“If you listen long enough, it actually sounds like a someone’s speaking.” He’d stared at me with such sincerity, and seemed a bit embarrassed to even bring it up, but there was something else there, too. Fear?\n\n“What are they saying?”\n\n“I crank up my music and try not to find out”, he smiled sheepishly.\n\nI work in IT, and my coworkers have been acting strange ever since they moved to a new building.\n\nSome of my coworkers, Liam included, were moved out of their old building, Building 1, for reasons we were assured ‘had nothing to do with asbestos’.\n\nFrom the first day they moved to Building 4, things started to go wrong. The old fluorescent light bulbs shattered the moment they were turned on, showering Liam’s boss, Dan, in glass and dust, probably a bit of mercury too. But, once they were replaced, within a couple of days, they started to have different issues – an electrician came out and found that the wires had been chewed through.\n\nOur company owns four buildings in the area, but the biggest one, Building 4, hadn’t been used in all the years I’d worked there. I’d always thought it’d been a waste to own a such large building and never use it – especially with the recent news about budget cuts and rumors about downsizing. It was a good sized building in a prime location, I wondered why they never used it, or at least sold it. Knowing what I know now, well, it’s starting to make sense.\n\nThey moved half the accounting team, and few seemingly randomly selected others into Building 4 after Building 1 was deemed unusable, and shoved all its other inhabitants in the other two. No offense to Liam – I mean, he wasn’t the fastest worker, as they noted on his performance review, but he was a perfectionist and he did great work – but it almost seemed like they moved the lowest performers there. I thought that was strange, why not move everyone from Building 1 into 4, rather than having several of us to a desk, shoulder to shoulder in the other two? They moved just fifteen people into that huge building and just the 6th floor – it didn’t make sense.\n\nLiam and I would meet up for lunch every day, so he had told me how much his new building freaked him out, but even then, I still wasn’t prepared the first time I stepped inside – it scared the ever-living shit out of me. \n\nThe font entry was poorly lit, as if the sunlight had taken one look through the grime coated windows and decided that it’d rather not come in, thank you.\n\nEven when you’re the only one in the elevator and only press the ‘6’ button, it stops on every. Single. Floor. \n\nThe doors will open slowly and jerkily, revealing unlit lobbies and silhouettes of toppled desks. The floors are mostly bathed in darkness because all the windows are taped over with something that only allowed a weak and grungy yellow light through.\n\nAfter seconds that feel like an eternity each time, the doors will slowly close. It’s just long enough to *almost* give your eyes time to fully adjust. Sometimes you could almost swear you saw something crawling towards you purposefully in the darkness before the doors closed. Almost.\n\nSometimes I wondered if one day the doors would open and something would be right on the other side, waiting. \n\nStaring out into the abandoned floors’ empty spaces while the doors open, an invitation to who knows what, always feels wrong –  even the times when you *don’t* feel the distinct sensation of being silently observed by something. It always makes my skin crawl. \n\nAllie, one of Liam’s coworkers, told me how one time, while the doors were briefly open on the 5th floor – she could’ve sworn she felt the elevator move – that slight sinking that would typically indicate the added weight of an additional passenger, but there was no one there but her. \n\nI chalked that up to her having an overactive imagination – it was the only way I could force myself into that elevator again, and I’d never risk taking the stairs. \n\nNever. \n\nNot after what happened to Ruth.\n\nAs much as I hated the place, I had to make plenty of trips over, it seemed like they were always having technical issues.\n\n&gt;*From: Dan*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Subject: My Computer is broken!*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Body: Kitty. I am so sorry, but my computer is having issues again. Thank you in advance for your help.*\n\nI was on my third (yes, third) trip to see Dan in a week about his computer when he too mentioned the noises from the vent in his own office. Dan was a nice guy, the kind that brought his team cupcakes for their birthday and asked about your spouse or kids. They’d been ‘gently’ encouraging him to retire since he’d accumulated quite the salary over the years, but he loved his job and genuinely cared about his work and team over the money.\n\nHe’d claimed to come in to discover his computer pushed onto the floor, for the second time (the first time was your run of the mill issue). This time, however, ‘issues’ was a bit of an understatement – it had not only been thrown forcefully onto the floor, but there was this shiny black tar-like substance leaking out of it. I knew Dan wouldn’t sabotage his own computer. He hated change and despite his refusal to use our cloud storage, he was a meticulous record keeper. There’s no way he’d intentionally lose his work –  he seemed to be genuinely distraught. \n\n“I’m sorry Kitty, but it wasn’t my fault!” He was borderline hysterical – his eyes, which were ringed with dark circles – pleaded with me to believe him.\n\n“Its fine”, I said absentmindedly, as I searched for anything salvageable.\n\n“But it really *wasn’t* me! It was the Night Manager! He doesn’t like that we brought the computers here.”\n\nThat was enough to make me look up, “Night Manager?”\n\n“Yes, yes. He tells me I’m not managing my team efficiently and that the lights and sounds bore into him like parasites into soft flesh.”\n\nIf his statement wasn’t enough to unnerve me (and it was, by the way), the way his eyes flickered nervously to the vent above his chair – which at that moment, was above my head – while he spoke certainly did the trick. I thought I saw something up there, the glint of light reflecting off eyes, but told myself that I needed to read less horror stories.\n\nIt seemed like everyone in that building was having trouble. I made a trip out later that day to swing by Keisha’s desk. She had been out on an extended sick leave and just came back, so she was anxious to catch up on her work.\n\nShe told me that she’d lost internet access. I found that the cable had just been disconnected from the port under her desk, I figured she’d accidentally knocked it loose without realizing – but as I tried to plug it in, I realized it was… stuffed with something; clogged up… somehow. I eventually managed to get enough of whatever was in there out that I could pull. I kept pulling and pulling until I’d yanked several feet of something out of it, it honestly reminded me of when I helped my mom snake her drain that one time, and the feel of it against my bare hands was nauseating. I kept pulling but never got to the end to it. I decided to just use the open port for the empty cube next to hers but while I was down *there*, I could see deep, gouge like scratch marks on the underside of the desk.\n\nI stopped by to grab lunch with Liam. He was blaring music so loudly that it hurt my ears even from 10 feet away – I had no clue how he could even focus. \n\n“Sorry”, he turned the music off. “They keep getting louder”\n\n“Who?”\n\nHe nodded upwards at the vent, then looked at me, embarrassed.\n\nMy trips to Building 4 became more and more frequent. More people had damaged computers, destroyed phones, shattered monitors – it was getting out of hand.\n\nI got one particularly odd email from Dan that he must have sent from his phone.\n\n&gt;*From: Dan*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Subject: broekn*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Body: ktye im sorry but compter is broekn again dont know how to fix it, we ate having issue with the screen it goes dark but my eyes hurt it gets so dark I cant see I cant see cantsee*\n\nI drove over, to find him sitting without the lights on in his office, staring into a dark monitor. His eyes looked sunken, as if they were receding backwards into his skull. The same liquid that had been in his broken PC dripped down from the vent onto his hair and shirt.\n\nIf he noticed, he didn’t seem to care or mind.\n\nHe’d unplugged everything, but was typing away frantically as if he were working. Despite me talking to him, it took awhile for him to realize I was even there.\n\nNot long after, things started to get more out of hand. Liam told me that Dan was making him nervous. He used to be a nice and pretty laid back guy, but he was acting strangely, becoming harder on everyone and reacted with uncharacteristic anger to even the smallest transgression. He’d stand in their office doorway or just mere feet away behind the staff in cubicles, just watching and literally breathing down their necks.\n\nHe became insistent that they work longer and longer hours, staying far after the sun had set.\n\nThe day Liam didn’t show for lunch or text that he was running late, I figured I’d head over and see how he was doing. \n\nHis office door had been closed when I found him, and I could still hear his playlist going. It was barely audible over the scratching. Instead of his usual playlist of Dio, Anthrax, and Pink Floyd, a low and droning whisper filled the room. I only realized it wasn’t coming from his speakers when I saw that everything in his office had been unplugged.\n\nI screamed when I found him.\n\nDan was in the office next to him and walked in but seemed unfazed by Liam’s body, or the smears of blood on the Inside of the open vent that went as far as I could see until disappearing into the darkness. Dan smiled at me in what I’d thought was an awkward attempt at comfort, but looking back was closer to the bared teeth of a predator.\n\nMaybe if I’d thought about it more when I noticed how Dan’s teeth and lips were crimson at the time, if I caught on sooner, at least some of the others would still be alive.\n\nAfter what had happened to Liam, I was hesitant to go back to Building 4. It had already freaked me out before but afterwards it had become the subject of many of my nightmares. \n\nI tried to avoid going back, but I kept getting emails from his from phone from Dan. \n\n&gt;*From: Dan*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Subject: ned help*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Body: needhelp plse come*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*From: Dan*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Subject: Do I let himin?*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Body: do lethim in?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*From: Dan*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Subject: Having an issue*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Body: Hello Katherine, I’m having an issue with my computer, please stop by.*\n\nI tried to get more information, but he never replied or answered the phone. So, I took a few deep breaths, and headed over.\n\nThe lights were off again, and the building seemed empty, but smelled awful. \n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Katherine.”\n\nThe voice was raspy and drug my name out into three long and slow syllables, it cut through the thick silence like shards of glass.\n\n“You’ve been ignoring his emails, Katherine.” I heard steps off to my side, “That’s not very professional of you.”\n\nI swiveled.\n\nDan was standing in the darkness a few feet away, the pale light leaked in and illuminated his face. Black dripped from the corners of eyes and nose, but there was something else, a spatter of dried blood covered his shirt and the entire lower half of his face.\n\n“They weren’t working hard enough.” he whispered, barely audible.\n\n“Dan, where is everyone?”\n\n“He let me in.” He smiled at me, I could make out a dark maroon staining his teeth.\n\nI looked around, squinting in the near-dark but definitely could tell all the desks were vacant, although I could make out several slumped forms on the ground.\n\nI sprinted back to the elevator, but to my surprise, he never followed me. He just laughed, coughing up a black foam.\n\nThat was the last time I ever saw him – well ,except for the time I could’ve sworn he was on the 5th floor, peeking out of a vacant office with a smile, just beyond the reach of light from the elevator.\n\nOur company said Dan went crazy, took himself out and everyone in the building out with him – why else would they find every other person in Building 4 torn apart, without any evidence of anyone else ever coming or going?\n\nThey pinned Liam’s death on him, too.\n\nI think Building 4 might be where my company sends people to make them disappear. I mean, it’s cheaper than severance pay.\n\nWhy would I have such a crazy thought? Because I told my manager, Syed, that I was concerned there something else was behind what happened. He actually believed me since he too had made a few trips out to Building 4, and told his boss, too. I think his boss was also concerned, but in a different way than we were.\n\nAnd Syed and I, we both got moved to Building 4. They gave him Dan’s old office. \n\nHe lasted a little longer than Dan did before he lost it, but that doesn’t help me much now.\n\nI did call for help, but right now, I am holed up in an office, with Syed screaming bloody murder and trying to claw his way in through the wooden door.\n\nIt’s *almost* enough to drown out the cacophony of scratches and the whispered invitations coming from the vent, saying that there’s something back there that I really need to see.\n\nAlmost.",

        "text": "Welcome, all those who wind up discovering and reading this, to my terrifying and nightmarish dilemma. I am genuinely hopeful, that all of us as a whole, collectively, may actually be able to identify and perhaps even rid my nights of this creature or entity. The stalking and the staring from the corners, moving between the natural shadows of the house , the creeping about, and moving along the walls or floors in the night. It has become absolutely horrifying, I've even started to experience some sort of paralysis when I try to wake in the night. I hear a sound, or I feel something brush up against my skin, a windy voice whispers into my ear. And when I try to set up, move, or roll over in the bed, I simply cannot. Sometimes it's brief and I see something flash by the corner of my eye in my peripherals. Other times it's lengthy and becomes a living nightmare that is inescapable. Ever since my little brother made a friend of this thing, life has been hell in our house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've already made my run through the usual suspects, to no avail. I talked to a medium, two different, \"spiritualists\", a parish priest, and I had both of the local paranormal investigation teams that I could find come over and check it out. And they just got nothing at all. REM Pods, Cat balls, spirit boards, a séance, and 5 different Estes method sessions. EVP recording devices and an SLS video camera setup, and absolutely nothing at all. This thing is here for my family, and it's smart enough to know to lay low when others are around. My little brother seems to be its link to enter our home freely, and convincing him that his new friend is bad seems pointless because he just isn't on board with that. He is convinced its his friend, he is one of those kids that's just a bit awkward, and he doesn't have many, if any, real friends here. On top of the fact that we did jut move here a few months ago. He just hasn't had any luck yet making any real friends. And I think that is part of the reason why this thing chose my little brother in the first place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've done my research, I looked into every cryptid from here to Thailand to no avail. I even talked to a somewhat well known cryptozoologist for forty and five minutes over a Skype call. And so that is why I am here now, to lay myself down at the collective feet of all of you amazing, horror and true crime obsessive web sleuths out there. If I'm going to find any kind of answers ore solutions now, I honestly believe it is going to be from the collective minds of all of you wonderful people. I truly do hope and pray that together we can figure this thing out and save my family. I honestly believe my family is in grave danger. I don't know if this thing is after my little brother in the long run, or if it's after my entire family. I don't know if it's making itself out to be a threat to me because it knows that I can see and feel it when it's here, or if it's doing the same to the rest of my family as well. I haven't spoken about it to my parents at all. But my mom is basically a wine-o and three quarters the way to drunk most nights, so I don't know if she would even notice the damn thing unless it punched her in the stomach or something. And my father is gone half the time for work, and he's sleeping or out fishing and stuff like that, when he is home anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do believe that my baby sister sees it too though, I'm more than positive of that. It happens all the time now, she will go from being fast asleep or perfectly fine and comfortable, to then, she just bursts into the blood curdling screams and crocodile tears. As if someone or something had just pinched the hell out of her in her sleep, or just stood there, a stinking, horrid, monstrous face, just looming over her in wait, until she opens her little baby eyes and then it jump scares the shit out of her. I feel for her and my little brother the most of all. I am their older brother, and I am supposed to look out for them. I can't let this thing get them, or take them, or kill them, or whatever it's intentions are. I just don't know what to do at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going to do my best to describe the thing that has been terrorizing my family as I possibly can. I read somewhere that the, Nightmare On Elm St. villain Freddy Krueger, was based on a shadow person. And I don't know if that is what this is, but it's the closest thing I can compare it to. It is black, always black, even darker than black it seems. It almost seems to absorb light rather than reflect or be illuminated by it. It is a shapeless mass when it moves about the house, but sometimes when it is still it almost seems to have the shape of a human being at times. The one thing I always notice about it is that the head or what I perceive to be the head area of this thing, always seems to be shaped as if it were wearing a cowboy hat, Or maybe some sort of head dress I'm not sure. Sometimes it seems like a black blob of nothingness, other times like a man that's super tall and skinny like a malnourished shadow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat keeps me from just calling it a shadow person is that it seems to be a physical being at times. My brother plays with this thing, and feeds it, he sneaks into the kitchen late at night to steal food. I've seen him through the crack of his bedroom door, rolling apples under his bed, and I've seen this thing catch them. A dark hand shooting out from under the edge of the bed and clutching the apple with speed. It carves things into his bedframe and walls with him, my brother has shown me the things he has drawn and the things it has drawn. It scrawls symbols and figures that look a lot like itself, and some of the images look like a family of those things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's made me think along the lines of, maybe this thing is trying to turn my brother into one of those things. And then maybe it will come for us next, to try and turn the whole family into these dark shadowy monsters. Also here lately, it has made me think of, or reminded me I guess of that old movie about monsters that live under kids beds. The monsters that are allergic to light and the main monster character was played by, Howie Mandel, I believe. Yea I guess it's because it appears to be coming from under there, from under his bed when it comes. Where it goes when it crawls back underneath there where it came from, I can't help but wonder. I've even flipped his bed over to inspect the flooring and things while my little brother was gone, it's just a regular old hardwood floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I forgot to mention the scratch marks, I woke with foot long scratch marks on my arms and chest about ten days ago. It looked like huge long welts, raised up off the skin, hot and red. I'm afraid any day now that one of us is going to be gone, dead, or who knows what that could be worse. I hate this damned thing and I wish I knew how to kill it. Right now I am trying to cleanse the house, I read up on it yesterday, and I bought the sage bundle and stuff today. I'm about to light it up in a second and start walking the house, hopefully I will be able to push this thing out of here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo luck there, but I swear I heard a growl when I was walking my baby sisters room, it sounded as if it came from within the wall. I had to hurry while they were all gone for the moment, and I'll probably be yelled at for the overbearing new smell in the house. But that's no big deal, I have got to try, at the least. I am just at such a loss physically, spiritually, and emotionally, on what to do, how do you fight an enemy that transcends the reality we reside in. How do you win a battle with a supernatural entity in a natural world, I'm no exorcist, or voodoo prince, I am ill equipped for the task ahead and I know it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I just had a breakthrough I think, with my little brother that is, I just realized tonight that he is hiding something from the rest of us. And I only realized it because he couldn't stop fiddling with it at dinner. He's keeping it in his pocket and he is definitely treasuring it for some reason. I don't know what the hell it is yet but it's important to him that's for sure. I'm going to wait until he goes to take a shower and then I'm going to ty and figure it out. I will sneak in there and retrieve it from his pants pocket or whatever, wherever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay so I didn't take it but I did figure out what it is, I saw it, he was wearing it in the shower, it was on his right hand. I swear when I  walked up on the bathroom door, I swear that I could hear talking, two voices back and forth. One was definitely my little brothers, the other, was a deep and rasp mans voice, the very moment that my fingers came into contact with the knob of the door, it stopped. I gently turned the knob after a long pause, listening for any hint of movement or speech. Nothingness, silence except for the sound of the water running and landing on the floor of the tub, normal shower sounds. I managed to open the door without so much as a squeak from the hinges, I think the moist hot air in there lubricated them in a way that silenced them for a change. Because they usually squawk a bit when you start to open that bathroom door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though, I gave myself away immediately, and he yelled loudly for whoever it was to, \"get the heck out! I'm in the shower!\", he said. I said sorry I had to go really bad and was in a hurry, and then I said I'm sorry bro and hesitated a second. I believe it was the sudden breeze in the shower and the change in the air that gave me away upon entry.  He yanked the curtain aside a bit and yelled at me again to get out now. I said, \"Jee-zuss bro, alright!\", and I left out quick and shut the door. But in the process I got what I had come for I think, I saw what I wanted to see. He used his right hand when he pulled the curtain aside, on his forefinger was a ring, and I've never seen it before. When I looked at it he realized that I had seen it, in a fraction of a second, and in the motion of a glance down, he looked at it himself and back at me before yelling that second time. In that short exchange of the eyes, that moment between us, we knew, that he knew, that I now know, what I know I'm not sure yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe way he reacted to me catching but a glance of his precious new ring, I could tell he was concerned about it. It was a large ring, especially on the finger of his twelve year old hand, it looked old, definitely gold, and it had the look of something that was expensive. I'd love to know where he got it, or who he must of nicked it from. It had engravings, and it bore a large blue stone. I'll find out more somehow, until then that's the best I got, I only got a short look at it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings have gotten out of control tonight, it's 3:40am, and I woke to the smell of smoke, my door wont open, and I'm freaking out. Every shadow in my room feels like it's alive or something, and I can't shake the feeling that something is watching me from somewhere. Just outside the windows, maybe from the gap underneath my closet door, from within the shadows themselves, I don't know. I'm scared to death, it's hard to even write this because my hands are shaky. And my nerves are on fire right now, it feels like some kind of electricity is in the air.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just heard a loud noise, like something was thrown up against the outside of my door. I went to it again and tried the handle, it opened this time, before it was like the knob was frozen in place, it wouldn't so much as wiggle a bit from side to side as a knob would normally do if it were simply locked. I opened the door and there on the floor was my baby sisters favorite pink and somewhat translucent Nuk, her favorite pacifier. A rush of adrenaline surged through my body as my senses started to compute and make some sort of understanding about my environment. The smell of smoke was so much stronger, and the smoke was visible, t took me a moment to realize it. My eyes were starting to burn and my nose was starting to dry out. The pacifier sent a chill up my spine despite the temperature in the hall being far hotter than that of my room. I had the sense that something terrible was happening, and I sprinted down the hall past my little brothers room and to my baby sisters nursery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe glow from the doorway as I approached, bit into my mind like some kind of vicious parasitic creature, delivering some sort of venomous potion, made up of the deepest dread and sharpest of fears. As I rounded the doorway I was forced back into the hall by the heat, my arm up to protect my face. Her bassinet was ablaze with blue flame, it was burning like a 55 gallon drum filled with tinder and kerosene. But with a supernatural glow and an otherworldly color of fire. I started to sway like a drunkard after a long Saturday night at the local watering hole. I turned and fell against my mothers half open door and landed against the door frame, her bed too was ablaze, and the brightness of the fire forced me to turn away. I stumbled down the hall and turned to face my brothers doorway, I kicked at it for what seemed like forever to me, and the ay the door flexed in and back seemed unreal. I finally got it to bust open, and what I saw broke what was left of my fragile mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother was standing there, in the middle of his bedroom in a sort of T-pose, arms stretch out, head turned freakishly up toward the ceiling. Standing behind him, tall and horrible, leaned over top of him, and looking him directly in his face. Was nothing less to my mind than an actual demon of some kind. It had it's hands on his shoulders, and it had some kind of dark smoke pouring out of it's nose and mouth. The smoke was diving into my brothers body with force, his lungs seemed over expanded and there was a great pain in is face. I wanted so badly to help, to save him from this nightmare, but I also wanted to run, run far and fast and never stop. I screamed with every molecule of air in my lungs and I passed out and hit the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt that very moment I awoke in my bed, it was quiet, except for a slight echo in my mind, the echo of the scream that came from me as I woke. I was drenched in sweat and breathing heavily, my head was pounding, and my heart felt like it was galloping it's way out of my chest like a stallion on methamphetamine. I could hear the blood in my body, rushing past my eardrums with a thud every time my heart slammed about in my chest. And as I sat there in that awful moment of horror, a name was bouncing through my mind like a crazed Mexican jumping bean. How it got there, how I knew it, or where it came from I will never know. But now I know what I am dealing with here, and all I can say is, God help us if there is one. I don't think anyone else is going to be able to anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe name is Asmodeus...",

The one thing I always notice about it is that the head or what I perceive to be the head area of this thing, always seems to be shaped as if it were wearing a cowboy hat, Or maybe some sort of head dress I'm not sure. Sometimes it seems like a black blob of nothingness, other times like a man that's super tall and skinny like a malnourished shadow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat keeps me from just calling it a shadow person is that it seems to be a physical being at times. My brother plays with this thing, and feeds it, he sneaks into the kitchen late at night to steal food. I've seen him through the crack of his bedroom door, rolling apples under his bed, and I've seen this thing catch them. A dark hand shooting out from under the edge of the bed and clutching the apple with speed. It carves things into his bedframe and walls with him, my brother has shown me the things he has drawn and the things it has drawn. It scrawls symbols and figures that look a lot like itself, and some of the images look like a family of those things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's made me think along the lines of, maybe this thing is trying to turn my brother into one of those things. And then maybe it will come for us next, to try and turn the whole family into these dark shadowy monsters. Also here lately, it has made me think of, or reminded me I guess of that old movie about monsters that live under kids beds. The monsters that are allergic to light and the main monster character was played by, Howie Mandel, I believe. Yea I guess it's because it appears to be coming from under there, from under his bed when it comes. Where it goes when it crawls back underneath there where it came from, I can't help but wonder. I've even flipped his bed over to inspect the flooring and things while my little brother was gone, it's just a regular old hardwood floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I forgot to mention the scratch marks, I woke with foot long scratch marks on my arms and chest about ten days ago. It looked like huge long welts, raised up off the skin, hot and red. I'm afraid any day now that one of us is going to be gone, dead, or who knows what that could be worse. I hate this damned thing and I wish I knew how to kill it. Right now I am trying to cleanse the house, I read up on it yesterday, and I bought the sage bundle and stuff today. I'm about to light it up in a second and start walking the house, hopefully I will be able to push this thing out of here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo luck there, but I swear I heard a growl when I was walking my baby sisters room, it sounded as if it came from within the wall. I had to hurry while they were all gone for the moment, and I'll probably be yelled at for the overbearing new smell in the house. But that's no big deal, I have got to try, at the least. I am just at such a loss physically, spiritually, and emotionally, on what to do, how do you fight an enemy that transcends the reality we reside in. How do you win a battle with a supernatural entity in a natural world, I'm no exorcist, or voodoo prince, I am ill equipped for the task ahead and I know it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I just had a breakthrough I think, with my little brother that is, I just realized tonight that he is hiding something from the rest of us. And I only realized it because he couldn't stop fiddling with it at dinner. He's keeping it in his pocket and he is definitely treasuring it for some reason. I don't know what the hell it is yet but it's important to him that's for sure. I'm going to wait until he goes to take a shower and then I'm going to ty and figure it out. I will sneak in there and retrieve it from his pants pocket or whatever, wherever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay so I didn't take it but I did figure out what it is, I saw it, he was wearing it in the shower, it was on his right hand. I swear when I  walked up on the bathroom door, I swear that I could hear talking, two voices back and forth. One was definitely my little brothers, the other, was a deep and rasp mans voice, the very moment that my fingers came into contact with the knob of the door, it stopped. I gently turned the knob after a long pause, listening for any hint of movement or speech. Nothingness, silence except for the sound of the water running and landing on the floor of the tub, normal shower sounds. I managed to open the door without so much as a squeak from the hinges, I think the moist hot air in there lubricated them in a way that silenced them for a change. Because they usually squawk a bit when you start to open that bathroom door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though, I gave myself away immediately, and he yelled loudly for whoever it was to, \"get the heck out! I'm in the shower!\", he said. I said sorry I had to go really bad and was in a hurry, and then I said I'm sorry bro and hesitated a second. I believe it was the sudden breeze in the shower and the change in the air that gave me away upon entry.  He yanked the curtain aside a bit and yelled at me again to get out now. I said, \"Jee-zuss bro, alright!\", and I left out quick and shut the door. But in the process I got what I had come for I think, I saw what I wanted to see. He used his right hand when he pulled the curtain aside, on his forefinger was a ring, and I've never seen it before. When I looked at it he realized that I had seen it, in a fraction of a second, and in the motion of a glance down, he looked at it himself and back at me before yelling that second time. In that short exchange of the eyes, that moment between us, we knew, that he knew, that I now know, what I know I'm not sure yet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe way he reacted to me catching but a glance of his precious new ring, I could tell he was concerned about it. It was a large ring, especially on the finger of his twelve year old hand, it looked old, definitely gold, and it had the look of something that was expensive. I'd love to know where he got it, or who he must of nicked it from. It had engravings, and it bore a large blue stone. I'll find out more somehow, until then that's the best I got, I only got a short look at it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings have gotten out of control tonight, it's 3:40am, and I woke to the smell of smoke, my door wont open, and I'm freaking out. Every shadow in my room feels like it's alive or something, and I can't shake the feeling that something is watching me from somewhere. Just outside the windows, maybe from the gap underneath my closet door, from within the shadows themselves, I don't know. I'm scared to death, it's hard to even write this because my hands are shaky. And my nerves are on fire right now, it feels like some kind of electricity is in the air.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just heard a loud noise, like something was thrown up against the outside of my door. I went to it again and tried the handle, it opened this time, before it was like the knob was frozen in place, it wouldn't so much as wiggle a bit from side to side as a knob would normally do if it were simply locked. I opened the door and there on the floor was my baby sisters favorite pink and somewhat translucent Nuk, her favorite pacifier. A rush of adrenaline surged through my body as my senses started to compute and make some sort of understanding about my environment. The smell of smoke was so much stronger, and the smoke was visible, t took me a moment to realize it. My eyes were starting to burn and my nose was starting to dry out. The pacifier sent a chill up my spine despite the temperature in the hall being far hotter than that of my room. I had the sense that something terrible was happening, and I sprinted down the hall past my little brothers room and to my baby sisters nursery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe glow from the doorway as I approached, bit into my mind like some kind of vicious parasitic creature, delivering some sort of venomous potion, made up of the deepest dread and sharpest of fears. As I rounded the doorway I was forced back into the hall by the heat, my arm up to protect my face. Her bassinet was ablaze with blue flame, it was burning like a 55 gallon drum filled with tinder and kerosene. But with a supernatural glow and an otherworldly color of fire. I started to sway like a drunkard after a long Saturday night at the local watering hole. I turned and fell against my mothers half open door and landed against the door frame, her bed too was ablaze, and the brightness of the fire forced me to turn away. I stumbled down the hall and turned to face my brothers doorway, I kicked at it for what seemed like forever to me, and the ay the door flexed in and back seemed unreal. I finally got it to bust open, and what I saw broke what was left of my fragile mind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother was standing there, in the middle of his bedroom in a sort of T-pose, arms stretch out, head turned freakishly up toward the ceiling. Standing behind him, tall and horrible, leaned over top of him, and looking him directly in his face. Was nothing less to my mind than an actual demon of some kind. It had it's hands on his shoulders, and it had some kind of dark smoke pouring out of it's nose and mouth. The smoke was diving into my brothers body with force, his lungs seemed over expanded and there was a great pain in is face. I wanted so badly to help, to save him from this nightmare, but I also wanted to run, run far and fast and never stop. I screamed with every molecule of air in my lungs and I passed out and hit the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt that very moment I awoke in my bed, it was quiet, except for a slight echo in my mind, the echo of the scream that came from me as I woke. I was drenched in sweat and breathing heavily, my head was pounding, and my heart felt like it was galloping it's way out of my chest like a stallion on methamphetamine. I could hear the blood in my body, rushing past my eardrums with a thud every time my heart slammed about in my chest. And as I sat there in that awful moment of horror, a name was bouncing through my mind like a crazed Mexican jumping bean. How it got there, how I knew it, or where it came from I will never know. But now I know what I am dealing with here, and all I can say is, God help us if there is one. I don't think anyone else is going to be able to anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe name is Asmodeus...",
