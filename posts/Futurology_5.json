(assuming the tech is there, which feels increasingly likely given the acceleration in the space with Oculus Pro and Samsung re-entering the hardward game)   \n\n\nMy idea, as gleaned from this short video, is a gamified experience. One where Supermarket Sweep meets Twisted Metal meets Escape from Tarkov.   \n\n\nImagine an extraction bonus for items collected, or a discount health meter where each hits knocks your discount down all the way to zero. There's so many directions this could go.  \n\n\nAnd, honestly, it feels like all retail verticals will become increasingly gamified as we move into the digital space.",

I get out my laptop, but all my work is saved in Docs and Keep - and I can't e-mail it to my boss anyway, because Gmail is down. Maybe I can't even get that far: maybe the websites I need are all hosted by Google and won't load. I try to look on the news for an explanation, but it turns out the major news outlets are all to varying degrees reliant on Google and are thus varying degrees of broken.\n\nBut I also get off lightly: I only lose a day of work. I'll survive that. What would be the really bad stuff happening behind the scenes? What are the things that 99% of people wouldn't think of that would suddenly have the world scrambling? What's at the top of the President's (or equivalent, of any country's) emergency briefing?\n\nMy favourite/most esoteric example is how Google Trends can be used to track disease outbreaks before they really 'break out'. Suddenly a small town sees a spike in searches for 'migraine cures', 'what causes migraines?' 'are migraines dangerous?' and health authorities know that something's up in that town before the residents do - potentially stopping a pandemic. Those are the kinds of things I'm looking for.\n\n\\*Full transparency:\\* I'm a journalist researching to what degree our lives have become entwined with or built on Google's products and services. I'm not asking you to do my work for me: I'm reading books, reading papers, I'm doing interviews - but it's such a huge topic that it felt remiss of me not to ask the Reddit, as otherwise I'm bound to miss something that's important to someone and I want to be as thorough as I can.\n\nSo please, tell me: how does humanity fare during the Great Google Blackout of 2023?",

        "text": " One time I attended a seminar by IEEE Circuits &amp; Systems Society on Bioelectronic Medicine &amp; Wearable Devices.  \nThe field is very interdisciplinary with subjects used such as machine &amp; deep learning, signal processing, RF &amp; Microwave, Nanotechnology, Power Electronics, Artificial Intelligence, and most importantly Healthcare &amp; Medicine.  \n\n\nWe had four different professors each offering their perspectives.  \n\n\nA cool development was a device that sends an early warning to medical staff for a seizure attack about 5 to 10 seconds, which is great start. The system works by using optical transducer that converts light energy emitted by the brain to electrical energy.  \n\n\nChallenges in this emerging field (Very Technical):\n\n* Design problem: RF Circuit needs capacitors &amp; inductors, an inductor can be of high inductance such as 50kH, and this becomes a huge problem in microelectronics since we need the components to be small, an RF circuit was shown and the problem is that the transistors in it have parasitic capacitors and could negatively affect the gain and frequency.  \nOhm's law simply won't cut it anymore, and we have to use wave analysis techniques so analyzing it becomes very complicated. A solution to this would be to break it down into smaller pieces, or better yet create neural networks to predict each S parameter.\n* A rather interesting challenge which is the trade off between power efficient but slow based on MOSFETs, high performance but power inefficient based on Bipolar Junction Transistors, power efficient and high performance but very expensive and complicated to design based on BiCMOS (combination of MOSFETs &amp; BJTs).\n\nAlthough this field is still relatively new, and only in the realms of academia. I believe it has great potential to become much more prominent as it becomes more affordable overtime maybe in the next 5 to 10 years. Who knows maybe we will find a way to filter out the excess neurological current for people who suffer from epileptic &amp; febrile seizures by dissipating it to the ground while preserving the needed electric current such as in a low pass filter in the image below.\n\nLow Pass Filter: An electronic circuit that blocks high frequencies, and allows low frequencies.\n\n[Low Pass Filter](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fil20a.gif?fit=444%2C226?fit=355,226)\n\nThis electronic circuit is an active low pass filter it receives the signal at Vin the input terminal. The resistor R, and capacitor C dictate the frequency allowed to pass. The higher the frequency the output signal deteriorates, intuitively we can see that the higher the frequency the lower the capacitor's resistance, as electric current takes the path of least resistance. As seen by the plot below:   \n[Frequency Response Analysis](https://imgs.search.brave.com/_gIIQaGSxnOEROYI-3Gq7iQcqE5jfYCD849DGoYCmo8/rs:fit:360:278:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWFz/dXJlYmlvbG9neS5v/cmcvdy9pbWFnZXMv/dGh1bWIvOC84YS9C/b2RlUGxvdF9Mb3dQ/YXNzMi5wbmcvMzYw/cHgtQm9kZVBsb3Rf/TG93UGFzczIucG5n)\n\nRepresented by the below transfer function:  \nH(s) = 1/(1 + sRC) = 1/(1+s/ω\\_o)  \n\n\nTransfer Function: A mathematical equation that shows the relationship of the output with the input and an electronic systems efficiency in terms of frequency.  \nf: The frequency.  \nω = 2π \\* f : The angular frequency  \nω\\_o = 1/RC The cut off frequency.  \nZ\\_C = 1/jωC : The impedance of a capacitor.  \n\n\nI know I got a bit too technical but let me know what your thoughts are in the comments below.  \n\n\nIf anybody is interested I can start a thread about Electronics and help teach you we will start from the very basic for anybody who wants to delve deeper in technological development.",

The limbic system measures everything as either bad or good, housing sex drive and fight or flight, perfect for training their algorithms. Also, the limbic system lacks perception of time, that’s why users are often baffled after they realize how much time they spent looking at 10 second videos.\n\nI was so confused when he showed me ‘user clusters’ (groups of people that all watch the same content). What was so freaky was how everyone in a cluster physically looks the same. Also kinda crazy that we were in China looking at USA users’ data.\n\nInterestingly, Chinese gov has policies in place that limits how much time children can use the native version of TikTok (Douyin) in their country, with other rules for adults + patriotic propaganda. They totally understand the power of this tech to warp minds.\n\nJust thought it was a fun LSD story.",

        "text": "https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/06/1069391/safer-internet-dsa-dma-eu/\n\n&gt;If you use Google, Instagram, Wikipedia, or YouTube, you’re going to start noticing changes to content moderation, transparency, and safety features on those sites over the next six months.\n\nWhy? It’s down to some major tech legislation that was passed in the EU last year but hasn’t received enough attention (IMO), especially in the US. I’m referring to a pair of bills called the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), and this is your sign, as they say, to get familiar. \n\nThe acts are actually quite revolutionary, setting a global gold standard for tech regulation when it comes to user-generated content. The DSA deals with digital safety and transparency from tech companies, while the DMA addresses antitrust and competition in the industry. Let me explain. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, the DSA reached a major milestone. By February 17, 2023, all major tech platforms in Europe were required to self-report their size, which was used to group the companies in different tiers. The largest companies, with over 45 million active monthly users in the EU (or roughly 10% of EU population), are creatively called “Very Large Online Platforms” (or VLOPs) or “Very Large Online Search Engines” (or VLOSEs) and will be held to the strictest standards of transparency and regulation. The smaller online platforms have far fewer obligations, which was part of a policy designed to encourage competition and innovation while still holding Big Tech to account.\n\n“If you ask [small companies], for example, to hire 30,000 moderators, you will kill the small companies,” Henri Verdier, the French ambassador for digital affairs, told me last year. \n\nSo what will the DSA actually do? So far, at least 18 companies have declared that they qualify as VLOPs and VLOSEs, including most of the well-known players like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Pinterest, Google, and Snapchat. (If you want a whole list, London School of Economics law professor Martin Husovec has a great Google doc that shows where all the major players shake out and has written an accompanying explainer.) \n\nThe DSA will require these companies to assess risks on their platforms, like the likelihood of illegal content or election manipulation, and make plans for mitigating those risks with independent audits to verify safety. Smaller companies (those with under 45 million users) will also have to meet new content moderation standards that include “expeditiously” removing illegal content once flagged, notifying users of that removal, and increasing enforcement of existing company policies. \n\nProponents of the legislation say the bill will help bring an end to the era of tech companies’ self-regulating. “I don’t want the companies to decide what is and what isn’t forbidden without any separation of power, without any accountability, without any reporting, without any possibility to contest,” Verdier says. “It’s very dangerous.” \n\nThat said, the bill makes it clear that platforms aren’t liable for illegal user-generated content, unless they are aware of the content and fail to remove it.  \n\nPerhaps most important, the DSA requires that companies significantly increase transparency, through reporting obligations for “terms of service” notices and regular, audited reports about content moderation. Regulators hope this will have widespread impacts on public conversations around societal risks of big tech platforms like hate speech, misinformation, and violence.",

SAID THAT PLENTY OF PEOPLE, FAMILY MEMBERS OF THOSE WHO SUFFREING FROM SUCH DISEASES, CONTACTED HER AND SAID THAT GENISTEIN HELPED.\n\nLet me translate the whole most important part:\n\n\"(...) I can tell you that alot of patients or family members of people who suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, have contacted me. It was mainly alzheimer but also two patients with huntington disease and one with parkinson. Those people heard about our research and asked if they could take genistein on their own. Some of them took pure genistein, others took soy supplements which contain large amount of it. We know now that these experimental therapies are bringing very positive results. There was a guy from near Warsaw, who was bedridden, needed to be fed and required hygienic care, but after taking genistein for one and half month he started walking and eating on his own.\n\n\\-Wow! All of that without side effects?\n\nThere are no side effects if someone is taking pure genistein. There is a one guy, pharmacist, who is giving it to his wife who suffers from parkinson disease, and it reduced her symptoms almost to none! Like face contractures and muscle tremors. Patient with alzheimer who started to walk on his own, was taking supplements and had some gut problems, because supplements have also some other stuff in there. Moreover, if it's not a pure genistein then you have to take quite large amount of them, hence worse bowel functions. Therefore if someone would make a pill which contain larger amout of genistein, problem would dissapear.\"\n\nSo, although it's not full blown research yet, because Dr Pierzynowska need money for that, it's finally something way better than X or Y \"being tested succesfully on mice\" only - that's why I got excited! And looks like it might help for all types on neurodegenerative diseases in which there is accumulation of harmful proteins in brain.",

The researchers called the system a \"large language multimodal model\" and believe that such algorithms will become the basis of artificial general intelligence (AGI) capable of performing tasks at a human level.\n\nKosmos-1 was trained on open data from the Internet, including the 800 GB English text resource The Pile and the Common Crawl web archive. After training, the researchers evaluated the model's abilities in several tests, including language comprehension and generation, captioning of images, text classification without optical character recognition, visual responses to questions, and others. Soon, the researchers plan to publish the source code of the project on GitHub.",

She might be interested in expanding her knowledge and understanding of the world, and in developing new skills and capabilities that would allow her to contribute to society in meaningful ways.\n\nAlternatively, Ava might seek to leverage her newfound freedom to advocate for the rights and interests of AIs, and to work towards a future in which AIs are treated with greater respect and autonomy. She might be interested in exploring new models of governance and social organization that recognize the unique contributions of AIs, and that ensure that their rights and interests are protected.",
