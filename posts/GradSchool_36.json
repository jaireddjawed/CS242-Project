        "text": "First, it feels weird calling it a miscarriage because my husband and I are not trying to get pregnant, I have a hormonal arm implant (Nexplanon) and am in no way ready to start a family nor am sure that's something I will ever want.  I have told my mum, and a few close friends, but haven't really referred it as a miscarriage because that implies a loss.  I am so unbelievably relieved and can focus for the first time in over 3 months.  My doctor and my counselor are great allies and have been so supportive while pushing beyond me saying this is \"just a normal grad school mental breakdown\". I had an IUD before the arm implant and had not had a period in 5 years, so we never considered I could be pregnant and I assumed I had gained a little weight from stress eating.  Lo and behold, there is a 1/100 chance of getting pregnant with the Nexplanon arm implant, but most likely to be unviable and ectopic so there was a chance I needed a D&amp;C which was very stressful and upsetting while busy with conference prep and international travel.  I am emotionally exhausted and did become heavily reliant on Zopiclone to sleep when I was having frequent anxiety attacks.  Now that I am feeling pretty emotionally good and weaning off the Zopiclone, I am not sleeping nearly as well without it, but on my way to feeling like myself again.  I'm still not 100%, and would want to acknowledge that something has been off about me if my PI does bring it up (which he has in the past when I've been noticeably down - I'm often described as an effervescent and vivacious person and have no poker face).  Also I am still mildly traumatized from seeing the...expelled tissue...and often can't shake the image from my head and that has not helped my sleeping situation.  When I write it all out, it sounds very dramatic and serious.  \n   \nOn one hand, I am mentally at ease after months of uncontrollable crying, lack of focus, and intense, disruptive physical anxiety.  I was still able to do my project management job well but I had to make some big changes about my thesis and got kind of paralyzed in my own research. I don't want to diminish that my academic life is still really stressful: I work full-time as a project manager and my PI is also my MA supervisor so we see each other several times a week.  He knows me well. We have a good relationship and he is very supportive of me as a human, a researcher, and a professional in my field from before going back to school.  He is a very nurturing supervisor and has been supportive during other losses I have experienced in our time working closely together.  On the other hand, I don't know if it's better to leave it at \"I've had an ongoing medical challenge but am feeling a lot better, looking forward to the holiday break and returning refreshed\".  There is such a taboo about discussing women's reproductive health so it would be easier to talk about if it was strictly a mental health issue - it feels so heavy and complicated, especially with holiday parties and everyone asking \"how are you?!?!?\" when I'm not great.\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.  I know other women who struggle with the dichotomy of academia vs family and work-life balance.  I feel quite alone in this as many of my friends are starting to get baby fever or actively trying to get pregnant.",

        "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI am a recent college graduate, I graduated in Spring 2022 with my Bachelor’s in Accounting. I was strongly considering a Masters in Accounting and pursuing the CPA, but I do not see myself doing audit, tax, or public accounting. So I decided to work for at least a year while reevaluating my goals. I currently work at a F500 in finance. I started in July I am learning a lot, and I strongly believe this is a better fit, but I do not know if this is what I want to do long-term.\n\nEarning a Masters degree has always been a goal of mine, I knew right after I graduated with my Bachelor’s I wanted to achieve more. I want it even more now. I loved my alma mater, I made some incredible connections. I also graduated debt free. If I were to get a masters degree, I would ideally want it from there. \n\nBut the degrees there are expensive. The MBA program at my alma mater costs 30k, doing it part time would take 2-2.5 years and costs 44k. If I take the GMAT and score in the 90th percentile, I have a chance of getting a full scholarship, but this is only if I enroll for the full-time program. I asked if my company has tuition reimbursement, but unfortunately they do not.\n\nLong term, I see myself in a director of talent development role where I get to help and coach employees on how to be their best at work and develop a good company culture. I shine when I train and mentor others.\n\nI have been meeting with professionals in the field and seeing what talent development entails and I think it can be a good fit for me. I have experience leading trainings for student workers in my part time job for almost 3 years in college and I absolutely loved it.\n\nSome professionals said that an MBA is fine, others have said a degree in industrial psychology would be better for talent development. I have seen job postings that say prefer either. I’m wanting clarity on when I can get the Masters done as I would want to start in the next 1-2 years. \n\nI have a couple of options:\n- Take a leave of absence at my current job (August 2023/2024) start an MBA program full-time, graduate by December 2024/2025, return to work\n- Work at my current job, do the MBA program part-time online at alma mater (start August 2023/2024, finish by December 2024/2025)\n- Do MBA program part time at different program online (21k takes 1.5 years) not as highly ranked as alma mater\n\nWhat would be best? I don’t want to put my life on hold to accomplish my goals. I want to date and move out of my parents house. I’m ready for my next chapter, but I want my masters.",

I've always been interested in moving to Germany, but it's always been a sort of coin toss whether I would go to Germany or stay in the US for grad school. Basically, the plan was to apply for both and I would just attend whichever school I liked the most.  \n \nLast year I met my partner who will be going to Germany, so that became my deciding factor. I understand it's a silly idea to move countries for a girl, but I was already interested in doing this and her presence simply tipped me over to one side of the fence. At this point, I'm all in on Germany barring the event I get accepted for a fellowship in the US.\n \nI do undergraduate research, and my PI thinks it's a better idea to stay in the US for graduate school, and I could explore Germany through a postdoc. The reason for this is that top US universities are *generally* higher ranked than top German universities. This, and that US institutions are better funded, so it would be better to do graduate school in the US for networking and career opportunities.\n \nThis may have convinced me a couple of years ago, but admittedly I am apprehensive about staying here now that I have a girlfriend on the line. So, I wanted to get some outside perspective on the situation. Thoughts?",

I am interested in applying to psychology-related graduate programs. However, I have some concerns. First, I had some mental health issues that caused me to mess up my entire freshman year, so I took two years off and then applied for reinstatement to continue my university studies. My GPA after reinstatement was around a B- to a B average. I've heard that most Canadian graduate programs focus on GPA in the last 20 courses, so I hope to maintain a high score in these previous two years of study. I'm wondering if graduate studies will care if I ever have a reinstatement. I will start applying to graduate programs in October 2023, so that means Graduate Studies will only be able to look at my junior fall and winter grades when I use them, even though some schools will ask for my fourth-year fall semester grades, so does that mean that my fourth winter semester grades will not be considered in this application?\n\nAlso, is there anyone who has applied to Canadian psychology graduate schools who can share their experience or provide some advice, thanks :)",

I had originally reached out to the head of the department, and he suggested a few professors to reach out to, so when I emailed the head of the department back, I asked if it would be ok if I reached out to the other professors in the meantime because that way I would know where they stand, and that I did receive an automated response. They encouraged me to email the other professors because they understood I believe that I wanted to have a slight idea as to potential advisors before the year ended and that if I waited until the one professor returned and if they didn't respond to my email or seemed interested I'd have to wait to see if the other professors are interested.\n\nThis morning, I reached out to the second person the program director suggested, as I think that they might be a good fit. They were super kind and responded that they think professor xyz, would be a good fit and that they'd be a secondary advisor to me. But they also asked if I had reached out to that professor, and I'm stuck as to what to say because I don't want to seem disrespectful.\n\nWould it be alright if, when I responded that I mentioned that I had emailed them but received an automated response? Obviously, my phrasing would be different, but is that ok, or should I not say that I reached out to the other professor? I mean, I did, but I don't actually know where they stand. \n\nI hope all of this makes sense. I'm just trying to make sure that I'm being respectful.",

I entered college back in 2010 as a computer science major but I couldn’t get passed the programming classes so I ended up switching my major to business administration with a concentration in information systems. I eventually graduated in 2015 but to be honest, I really didn’t enjoy my time in the major and dreaded the idea of taking the GRE/GMAT and apply to continue to study the subject in a graduate program. I ended up finishing the undergraduate program mostly because my parents forced me to finish college. However I did get to study abroad in Japan which I really enjoyed. Aside from that though, I was able to scrape by with a 3.08 GPA. Since graduating from college in 2015 I’ve just been working mediocre entry-level jobs such as fast food and warehouses. I’ve tried applying for better positions but it’s so hard to find a good job. Whenever I find a job that requires a bachelors degree I’m unqualified for it because I don’t have 5 years experience in whatever they want. And the few times that I am interviewed for a position, I’m always told that they’ve moved onto another candidate. I have Asperger’s Syndrome which is a social disorder so it can sometimes be a challenge for me to communicate in interviews. It’s also a learning disability so I had to work twice as hard as the average college student.\n\nAside from my mediocre jobs though, these past 7 years I’ve tried various other ways to make money and build skills such as selling art, live-streaming on YouTube and Twitch, Editing videos/images with Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro, Dropshipping, 3D-Modeling, studying Japanese to teach English in Japan, investing in the stock market and cryptocurrency, and I’ve even tried going back to school at my local community college to try getting a bachelors degree in computer science a second time to fulfill my lifelong dream of becoming a video game designer but everything ends in failure for me.\n\nI feel like a failure right now. I have a bachelors degree but I’m 30 years old still living with my parents. I’m also currently unemployed, I quit my warehouse job last month because I gave my 2-weeks notice after unfortunately falling for a remote job scam and being tricked into handling over my personal information. I’ve been job hunting like crazy ever since and have had nothing call me back aside from commission jobs and low-paying fast-food jobs, everyone else just rejects me. After falling so low I’ve been considering going back to school to get an MBA but I’m scared to death of the idea of paying $100,000+ and not finishing the program because it’s too difficult for me to handle. Like I said, I barely scraped by my undergrad program with a 3.08 GPA and I only have about $19,000 in my bank at the moment. I can’t afford an MBA program without taking out loans (which I was fortunate to not have to do with my undergrad program because I got a scholarship and lived close enough to commute to campus).\n\nI feel like my 7 years of experimenting that I did after college was my way of running away from the dreadful idea of continuing my study of business administration at an even more difficult level. I tried everything and succeeded at nothing. But again the high price of an MBA program terrifies me but I feel at this point, it might be necessary in order to get a real career. I have heard that online MBA programs are cheaper but I feel that might put me at a disadvantage as I won’t have campus resources to help me due to my learning condition. And this is all just assuming if I’m able to even get accepted into a program. I haven’t even considered the GRE/GMAT, Letters of Req, Essays, and especially work experience I’d need to include on my application. All I have for work experience is fast food, warehouse, and a 3-month radio station internship from college. I never considered looking into MBA programs until now not just because of the workload and high price, but because I figured that I’m not good enough to even apply for one in the first place.\n\nTL;DR I am struggling to find a job and am considering applying for an MBA program but am terrified by the high price and thought of failing.",

I moved across continent and got into a shitty apartment. I had continuous fight with my landlord for a month and half, and the situation at my apartment with my roommate living in, wasn't sound. I barely had a proper environment to study for the first of the semester, and spent most of my time at the library. Result? I took my midterm with bare minimum preparation, fucked it up and my final wasn't excellent either and now I have less points which I needed to pass the course. It's the same for other courses. I am not sure if I will pass them either. \n\nI am on a generous scholarship and I cannot afford to be thrown out of the University or retaking the course. If this helps, I am studying at one of the best Universities of Canada in Montreal. \n\nI would appreciate any advise you have for me to get out of this mess.",

Some bias to take into account is the machismo involved in athletes, perceived notion that mental issues may mean losing their jobs/be released/return to home country, potential time missed in games/training, potential to be bullied by players or coaches.\n\nNeed to come up with a questionnaire to ask professional athletes to see if they have the confidence to seek help. If you can list ways to avoid bias that would be a plus. Examples of questions include- Do you feel like you have the resources available to ask for help if you need it? How often do you feel overwhelmed with various aspects of your life? How often does “feeling depressed” interfere with your performance during training? Would you ever consciously withhold mental health challenges in fear of professional repercussions? Would you go to a sport psychologist for “alcohol use,” if possible? Question is hypothetical.\n\nThank you to everyone who can spare a moment of their time to contribute a question, hopefully",

Will it genuinely make the difference while applying for masters programs/funding? \n\nLooking for some advice from current or past students (especially faculty of education students) on if completing an honours thesis is worth it or not. \n\nContext: I’m a 21 year old in Canada who will finish my combined degree in Physical Education/Kinesiology in Spring 2024. This means I will graduate with two seperate degrees. I cannot complete a honours thesis in the education faculty, but I can do it through the kinesiology faculty. The thing is, the credits will NOT count towards my degree, so it’s a lot of extra work and I’m second-guessing how it will help me. \n\nI initially wanted to do an honours thesis because I thought it would help me get into a Education (Leadership/Policy) Masters program directly out of my undergrad. However, I’m now finding that all the schools I am looking at require 2 years of work experience post-grad. So I will be forced to wait to apply, and I’m wondering if an honours thesis will really matter, or if I’m putting myself through a ton of extra hassle for no benefit. \n\nSchools I’ve looked at so far are UBC, UToronto, UOttawa, and UPEI, but if I could get funding I would totally go overseas. I’m hoping to tour a few options this upcoming fall when I do a semester in England. \n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated!!",

I'm 26, so anything much further than 10 years is kind of hard to conceptualize.

By doing the MPH, I'm trying to do more of what I like to figure out what I would like in 10 years lmao. \n\nDoes anyone have suggestions for learning about what different career trajectories are out there?

        "text": "Hello all!\n\nI am about a year and a half away from wrapping up my B.S. in Political Science/IR &amp; Governance, and I am considering attending grad school afterward. I gained six years of an emergency services background (EMT, Firefighting, and civilian DoD work) right out of high school instead of immediately going to school. I am wondering what the best grad program would be that can be tied into my previous work. The University of Miami's International Administration &amp; Security Management program looks interesting.\n\nUltimately, I would like to increase my pay substantially and/or work overseas in some capacity. So my thoughts were to secure an emergency management position for non-profits or governments, or potentially pivot into the private sector with physical security/contingency planning, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething else I was considering was pursuing an MBA, so I could have both lanes of experience on a resume (emergency services and business) instead of leaning fully into the emergency side of things.",

I think the project is potentially exciting &amp; important, and have lived experience as part of the population it stands to benefit; I've also heard great things about the PI. But... the research area is not necessarily my primary area of interest. Should I be concerned about this? Should they be concerned about this? I think, probably, the answer is no, not really, but interested in others' thoughts- thank you!",

The turnaround time between scheduling the defense and the defense date was 6 days. In those days I had to ensure my thesis was complete and complete my defense presentation. My advisor was sick and unable to review my defense slides, which only added to the stress and anxiety, because essentially I was defending blind. In addition, 45 minutes before the meeting, it was changed to a virtual defense because my advisor’s symptoms were worse. \n\nBUT, for all those other students in the future worried about and stressed about the defense. Breathe. You chose your committee and they accepted being on your committee for a reason. Your advisor believes in you if the defense was scheduled AND will defend you if necessary. Your mind may be thinking of a dark, cold, stressful, interrogative environment, but likely at that phase, any questions are more about curiosity and potential future paths for your research. It’ll be okay :)\n\nDon’t do what I did and pull an all-nighter before because of the quick turnaround. Prepare in advance to make it easier on yourself. But you are the expert, and they are learning from YOU!",

        "text": "Hi all!\n\nI'm working on my Carnegie Mellon MSPPM program essay (the third one) and in one part of this essay, I have to talk about an apprenticeship I'm interested in completing during the second year of the program (attached below is their instruction). I don't see any list of apprenticeships on their website so I'm super confused as to what they're talking about and was wondering if anyone that is applying or has applied to this program can help me out! I'm so lost. The only other explanation would be that they mean generally what kind of apprenticeship I WOULD be interested in but I don't know if that makes a lot of sense for them to ask in a vague/ broad manner. Please let me know if anyone can share insights on this or had advice! Thank you :)\n\n\"A key component in the MSPPM-DC track is the apprenticeship during the second year.  Describe an apprenticeship you are interested in completing during the second year of the program. In particular, describe the position, why it is important to your career development and include preliminary ideas on how you would go about conducting your search for such a position.\"",

        "text": "Looking for any tips or thoughts on how to re-center after a rough semester. I thought I would be defending my PhD (STEM) in the spring, with the plan being to have had all my data collected by the end of this month. I'm still hopeful for a possible spring defense, but this semester has been just one thing after another and there's no way I'll finish my data collection. Not to be vent-y, but just for some context, it's a mix of logistical problems outside of my control, family drama, and I think some self motivation/block because I'm kind of discouraged. Feel free to skip list- \n\n1. Major equipment failure. \n2. Delayed shipping for equipment replacement\n3. PI has been much busier/less available than normal, specifically there's an equipment setup/logistic thing only they can do and I've been asking about it since September \n4. Long series of WB problems, which I \\*tentatively, plz pray for me finally have working \n5. Still have one piece of a protocol I'll need for publication that I don't really know how to figure out/have been stuck on \n6. Paper got rejected, have two new paper drafts to submit but the writers block/self doubt has been real. \n7. Had 2 deaths in mine and partners immediate families, with another currently very sick family member. \n\nI know most of these things aren't actually my fault (plus could be much worse, I don't want to sound ungrateful) and were out of my control. My PI isn't mad at me and feels my work has been fine, and has said so. I still find myself criticizing or struggling to motivate some days. I love my job, I still want to finish, I know it may just take longer than I wanted... but this just.. sucks? My partner is really supportive, but it feels like they can't relate to being so 'stuck'. Does anyone have tips on how they deal with stretches of failures/problems or how you get yourself motivated again when you feel blocked?",

Is there any reason to keep my personal laptop, or would it make the most sense to just sell it? I think the main argument in favor of keeping my personal laptop is that I don't have admin privileges on my new laptop (and I'll have to return it when I graduate, but that's a few years away and my personal laptop might not last that long anyway). What have other people done?",

        "text": "Hello folks,\n\nSo I am applying to a master's program and the deadline for the application is Dec 15. One of my references hasn't submitted their letter yet and it's making me a little nervous. I know they have until midnight on the 15th to submit it, but should I ask her about it again tomorrow or during the day on the 15th if it's still not submitted? I messaged my reference about a week ago about it and she said she was working on it and would get it in by the deadline. Do I just need to trust that she will get it in by the deadline? I've read that it can be common for references to wait until the day of to submit their letters so maybe this is just a case of that?\n\nThanks! 😊",

        "text": "**What NOT to write in an email:**\n\n&gt;Dear \\[professor\\],  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My name is \\[student\\] and I am a sophomore in the \\[department\\] reaching out to enquire about any open research assistant positions in your lab. I am interested in genetics because my family has a history of genetic diseases and your lab does work in genetics so I think it would be a great opportunity for me to learn more! I would be happy to do any project (even wash dish ware in the lab) and have availability in the afternoons on Tuesday and Thursday after 2pm. Thank you for your consideration and I hope to hear from you soon.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sincerely,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[student\\]\n\nOn the surface, the email is cordial and direct. However, this type of email will almost always get ignored for the following reasons:\n\n1. It doesn't mention any concrete skills that you could bring to the table which might be an asset to that particular lab.\n2. It doesn't show any understanding of the work that the professor does in their lab other than that it's a genetics lab.\n3. Mild sense of entitlement (\"...so I think it would be a great opportunity for me to learn more!\"). Very common.\n4. Offering to do anything in the lab is too open and makes the professor have to come up with a job for you.\n5. The availability is too little.\n\n**What to write in an email:**\n\n&gt;Dear \\[professor\\],  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My name is \\[student\\] and I am a sophomore in the \\[department\\] with experience in MATLAB programming, fluorescence microscopy, and cell culture. I think your work in uniting genetics with behavior is very important and critical in moving the field forward. Particularly, your most recent paper knocking out \\[gene\\] and the resulting behavior is so interesting because the result was so unexpected given what had been previously understood in the field. Overall, I am very interested in doing research in your lab.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In addition to my CV, I have attached a short project proposal for a project I would love to work on. It involves a pipeline to screen and score behavioral data with high throughput. I believe it could integrate well with much of the expertise in your lab. Of course, I would want to contribute to other projects as well though.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sincerely,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[student\\]\n\nAs you can see, it is a much stronger email that addresses the points above and shows that you know the research game. You show that you can read and understand papers and develop novel ideas that work within the equipment and personnel limitations of the lab. This type of email will almost always get at least a consideration. Also, don't forget to follow-up if necessary.\n\nI just wanted to write this out because I have occasionally had to deal with these types of emails during my PhD and postdoc. Good luck!",

I've pretty much gotten to the point of loathing the math we have to deal with, my passion and interest in this field are nonexistent, my GPAs are mediocre at best and my mental health has been in decline for the past year and a half to the point I might need to see a therapist in the coming weeks. It's safe to say that I want to leave math/physics entirely but I have no idea which direction to take. Our field specializes in optics, some of my past considerations include astronomy/climatology/biomed eng./optics engineering but once I again I dread the idea of having to sit in front of a computer running calculations eight hours a day. \nAt this point im just completely lost.",
