Also luckily for me, I'm the only driver scheduled from 5-7. Woo!\n\nSo the time comes. This is a $500 order to my University football team. 60 sandwiches, 30 chips, and 30 cookies. Unfortunately for me, my store just switched our DMR from a percentage based system to a mileage system. As a result, I only make $.39 per mile.\n\nAnyway, the order is finished and I load it into my car. 5 boxes and a catering bag take up my entire backseat.\n\nI arrive at the athletic training center, and call the guy. No answer. Call again. No answer. Finally get a hold of him on the third try. He says to bring it all upstairs. Sure.\n\nFinally upstairs, I set the first two boxes down, and head downstairs to get the rest. Get it all up on the second trip and even help set it up on the tables in front of the room.\n\nFinally, after it's all delivered, I ask for the card slip. He signs, and hands me the slip. Then he reaches for his wallet.\n\nNot a good sign. An order that large usually doesn't tip cash, but I'm thinking, hey maybe he'll hand me a decent sized bill.\n\nIn my hand he places two wrinkled $1 bills.\n\nWe exchange pleasantries, and I exit the room.\n\nI look at the card slip. 0 written on the gratuity line, original total rewritten, and initialed. Not even signed, initialed.\n\nGet back to the store and return from my 24 minute delivery.\n\nAll in all, with mileage and tip, I made $2.81 on the order.\n\nAbsolute ass.\n\nVery next delivery is a $3 pre-authorized tip. A fitting ironic ending.\n\nTL;DR: $500 delivery. Mileage system gave me $.81. Guy gave me two wrinkly $1's.",

I've been to that hotel many times and I notice that I've never been to the room number posted on the ticket, so I go into the office and ask \"Do you know where room 352 is?\" and they say \"There is no room 352\". I leave the office and go back to my car to call the number on the ticket to ask them what room they're in, since it might have been a mistake on the order taker's part. I call the number and after a few rings, I get an answer from the guy. \"Hello, did you order a pizza\"? \"No, I didn't order no pizza\" \"Okay, sorry for bugging you\". I hang up and I drive back to the store and say it's undeliverable. \n\nSince that was the last delivery of the night, I stuck around to help another driver with the dishes and while the manager was logging me off, the phone rang. Guess who it was? The dude who denied ever ordering a pizza earlier, wondering where his pizza was. My manager pointed out that I tried to call him and he didn't answer, and then he said \"okay\" and hung up.\n\nIt's fucking crazy what kind of people you see doing this job, but the last one I thought I'd see would be someone who denied they ordered anything, only to complain that they didn't get it. Has this happened to anyone else? What was their reasoning?",

        "text": "I deliver for Marco's pizza. I had a delivery one night and thought it would be just like any other delivery I've had in the past. I live in Georgia, so I usually deliver to rural areas.\n\nI was about to get off in an hour and I got this delivery to this road that I knew was in a very wooded area. As soon as I get up to the house, the person's driveway was like 1/4 miles long, so I just drive up the driveway and park there. I get the food out of my car, a pen, and the receipt and start walking towards the front door. As I'm walking to the front door, a middle-aged skinny woman comes out from behind the house and says \"hey, we're over here in the garage!\"\n\nNow, that was the first red flag.\n\nI go to the lady's garage, but I just stand outside the doorway. I look inside the garage and there are two overweight, old men sitting in recliner chairs in all camo clothing. I look at the walls and there are at least 5 rebel flags hanging, 6 dead deer heads, and a Trump 2016 poster on the wall (I really freaking wish I was kidding).\n\nI'm FTM transgender, I had been on testosterone for about 6-7 months at the time, so I looked very androgynous, but tried my best to present as male. The woman and two men kept calling me \"ma'am\" and \"miss.\" I think the scariest part was when one of the men asked me to come inside the garage. I politely declined and informed him that we weren't allowed to go inside the customer's house or garage. He ignored me and soon all three of them were asking for me to go into their house. Again, I politely declined and gave them their pizza and told them the total. I think they ended up tipping me about $3, which isn't that bad, really (better than a stiff at least).\n\nEvery time I pass by that road, I get the spooks.\n\nWhat about you guys? Any weird/creepy stories?",

It wasn't his fault that the place smelled like a toilet to a nausea-inducing extent, nor was it exactly in his control that he had to wear a supercharged jet-engine type of CPAP or oxygen machine, but it nevertheless made either taking his order over the phone (Try understanding a man speaking over that into a crappy cellphone.) or delivering to him a less than anticipated experience. But, whatever, part of the job and I couldn't help but feel bad for the guy; he didn't really seem that old (nor did a disturbingly significant portion of the patients) but was nevertheless profoundly and likely irreversibly sick.\n\nMoving to the present of a few days ago I'd delivered to him enough times to have memorized his name and mercilessly mocked the presence of a Pepsi machine in the lobby during any deliveries to nurses since then. It was probably against the rules but the staff seemed to give zero fucks and always buzzed me into the dialysis room for me to deliver bedside service. \n\nIt very much was against the rules, and on this day some higher-ranking supervisor was on site. Contrasting the usual thoroughly practiced indifference the staff clammed up, \"We can't let you back here, sir.\" A few minutes of dithering later a nurse or whatever tells me she'll take the receipt back for him to sign. Shortly after that, the supervisor lady comes storming out, slams the receipt and my pen onto the table in front of me, and angrily informs me that I am welcome to wait for the police if I wanted the receipt assigned. Apparently my customer didn't take kindly to being told that he wasn't getting his pizza and started throwing things at her. \n\nGiving zero fucks (dead slow Monday day shift) and riding the line between bemusement and amusement I asked her if she wanted me to blacklist the clinic from deliveries, to which she replies yes, please do not deliver to patients, blah blah blah I'm trying to save lives here. Partially to calm the woman down and more than partially to indulge my own sense of humor I relayed a short tale of taking his order and the difficulty in getting his credit card information, in the middle of which instead of asking for the expiration date on his card I mistakenly asked for *his* expiration date. She laughed hysterically. Mission accomplished.\n",

Not trying to too my own horn or anything but I'm a pretty good worker. I got employee of the month last month but that got taken away due to other drama with the manager. The manager is a total douche with no respect for his employees. (I'm sure everybody's got at least one.) He's often just insulting us just because he enjoys it. Usually we're pretty thick skinned about it and fire back at him. But every now and again he crosses the line and just seems like a complete dick. \n\nToday we're in the middle of our Friday dinner rush. I'm moving all my deliveries as fast as I can. Normal Friday, no big deal. Then he told me to take this next delivery as a double. The address is an address I already know doesn't exist and the apartment number is incorrect as well. I ask him about it and he calls me a \"fucking retard\" and won't even tell me clearly what is going on with the order. I'm just asking questions so I can do my job. That's when I got upset and told him to show me some respect. Now is when he starts to just call me a fucking retard at least three more times like a little could would do. Fucking retard fucking retard fucking retad. Then he tells me not to take the double and he'll get someone else to do it. So I take my run and I come  back to the store. He tells me to grab my bag because I'm fired. This is the moment I pretty much reenacted the scene from HalfBaked where he quits in the fast food place. *Need for better judgement starts here* I threw the pizza at him. Ruined three orders and possibly more because they landed on the pizzas he was cutting. So he tells me to do a few things while he's counting my bag. \"I don't work here anymore. Eat my dick.\" Then he keeps my tips so I kept the delivery bag full of money and left the store. \n\nBut wait there's more! I might just have been reading too many conspiracy theories but it may have been a setup! About a week ago I caught him stealing money out of the tips of the insiders money bag. I told him that he shouldn't be doing that (and to my knowledge is a violation of law. Tips are property of the employees not him.) We texted about it for an hour or so where he admitted to doing and and didn't care and I told a few of the insiders (haven't got any tips in two or more months, but we had A LOT of money in tips coming in everyday) We trained a new head driver three days later. Then onward to today where I get fired. \n\nTLDR: I was called a fucking retard and fired then threw a pizza at my manager and it's a government coverup. ",

I'm working at getting better with basic human interactions, but it's still pretty difficult.\n\nI'm at the register, taking a phone order, and this guy walks in. I tell him that I'll help him in a second, right after I get off the phone. No kidding, *the second I put the phone down,* this guy starts saying very loudly, \"I WANT A LARGE PEPPERONI PIZZA AND A THIS AND A THAT\",\n\n so I politely interrupt him and ask, \"I'm sorry sir, could I get a name for that order?\"\n\nSo instead of acting like a *normal* person, he just raises one eyebrow and stares at me.\n\nI ask him again, \"Can I have your name, please, sir? I need to know who this order is for.\"\n\nAnd he says ^^\"mumble ^^mumble ^^mumble\"\n\n\"Sorry? Could you say that again?\"\n\n^\"mumble ^mumble ^mumble\"\n\nI still can't hear him, and I know he's just being difficult, since he was literallly shouting his order at me 10 seconds ago.\n\n\"I still can't hear you, could you speak up a little?\"\n\n\"ALRIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT, NEVER MIND. I DON'T YOUR FOOD IF YOU PEOPLE ARE JUST GONNA INSULT ME.\"\n\nAnd then he stormed out. Great, go away, I don't want to deal with you.\n\nNope. Turns out he's the husband of the lady in the shop next to us, and he's going to pressure wash the whole sidewalk.\n\nFor the rest of my shift, this guy is staring at me and giving me the dirtiest look you can think of. I'm at the register,  he's watching me. I'm going out to my car for a delivery, he stops and stares me down. This guy was being creepy as fuck. The whole time, I'm playing it up in my head, \"What did I do wrong, what could I have done to make him not hate me?\"\n\nSecond one, the girl. I'm out on a run, and as   I'm driving down a residential street, I see a cute girl on a bike, probably my age or alittle younger, going the other way. I pass her, and *she waves and says \"hey\" to me.\" Now this never happens to me. The last time a girl said anything to me was... I have no idea. Probably a year and a half. Now it may sound crazy, but that \"Hey\" was the best part of my month. Better than $50 a day in tips, better than... all of it. Someone acknowledged that I exist, not for getting their order wrong, their pizza late, or just rent money, but for just being there, as a person. Thanks girl, whoever you are.",

So I've been a pizza guy for a little over a year now at a local pizzeria. I was strict delivery and cashier only for about 8 - 10 months when one of the chefs got me into pizza making. I quickly got pretty good at it and soon started making pizzas and delivering on a daily basis. At this time we had 3 chefs, but one of them didn't really make pizzas he was more of a prep and pasta maker guy. A few weeks after the school year ended one of the pizza makers quit to focus on summer classes, and my boss asked if I wanted to work a few days just being a chef. I said yes and I got a pretty perfect schedule, very close to 40 hours with 3 whole days off. Then all hell broke loose when the prep chef walked out with a 10 xl order and an 8 xl order still to be made, I got called in and that week I worked around 60 hours. Soon after my boss calls and asks if I want to go on salary making $600 a week working 5 days for about 60 hours. This is a pretty great deal especially at my ripe age of 17 and compared to my $200 to $300 check I get now, however one of the main reasons I got the job was the flexibility on hours. I'm not sure if I can handle all the hours but the money would be great seeing how I'm about to go into college in the fall and need help with tuition.\n\ntl;dr: my boss offers me $600 for 60 hours a week, but I'm not sure if I can handle it.\n\nAny advice would help, thanks in advance!",

We parted ways happily, but I had one nagging question: who thinks a $6 tip isn't enough?

        "text": "To start, I am a pizza delivery driver in a town of approximately 200,000 people. I've been doing this for almost three years now and I wanted to see if there was any correlation on race and/or sex and tipping. Over the time of approx. three months (92 days) I kept track of when I was tipped after every run, based on race and sex. \n\nI considered a 'tip' to be at least $1. So if an order was $19.63 and a $20 bill was given and I was told to keep the change, it does not count. I chose $1 because the minimum order for delivery is $10, and $1 is 10% of that. Standard gratuity in most places in the United States is 15%. Orders usually are $20+ so I felt that 10% of the minimum was more than fair. \n\nOver the three months I worked roughly 5 days a week and every shift was during the night. I ranged between 15-30 runs a night and delivering to people of all income levels. \n\nI took 1000 total deliveries. Of those 1000 I was tipped 788 times which is 78.88% of the time. \nWhite males tipped me the most often, 85% of the time (430/504 orders).\nThe next follows white females. I was tipped about 80% of the time (278/346 orders)\nNext was African American males who tipped me 56% of the time ( 28/50 orders) \nAnd African American females tipped me the least often, only 30% of the time ( 20/66 orders). \n\nI kept data for or other ethnicities but did not get enough data to really get a solid percentage. However I did add their numbers to the male and female totals. \n\nI took 572 orders to males and 427 to females. I was tipped roughly 83% of the time by males (474/572) and roughly 73% of the time by females (314/427). \n\nI tallied in a mini notebook after every delivery. I'd say my results/data keeping is accurate within 99%. \n\nQuestions? Comments? Concerns? \n\nEDIT: I made some pie charts. [Tips based on Sex and Ethnicity](http://imgur.com/a/NTku1)",

Well, I was the one to do the trade so I didn't think I would get any money for the run (as should be expected sense I'm getting a good meal for it), so my manager gives me a dollar when I go out. Well turns out the bro who does the trade gives me his food for my food, then gives me an extra $5 for the drive.

And when they don't tip, it's like they are directly affecting my quality of life, and It's really making me hate people. \n\nHow do you not hate the shit out of everyone and lose your shit when you have a bad night? When you know your financial stability is literally in the hands of judgement calls at the door?\n\nIt's really getting to me guys. ",

        "text": "Hey awesome delivery people! From a person who is constantly working (from home, and past dinnertime most days), thank you all for bringing people like me tasty tasty foods. I get delivery once or twice a week from our local \"delivery available\" places, so I'm pretty used to the standard delivery situation. This week, though, my pizza was delivered by two humans (both very nice, no complaints, nothing at all 'sketchy' about it aside from it being the first time it's happened) and I was just wondering if this is typical? I guessed it was an experienced driver training an new employee, or a 'ride along' but even if it was, both humans came to the door, which was a little strange to me (I'd think in a ridealong, the non-employee would sit in the car, and I wish I'd noted whether the second person was wearing company apparel - I do not THINK human #2 was, whereas the person who handed me the food/receipt was wearing a cap from the company). Is it possible there's some kind of stranger danger situation going on in my neighborhood, which is making deliverypeople 'double up'?\n\nThe actual confirmed delivery-person was fairly young-looking (late teens to early 20's) so it could have just been a training situation?\n\nThanks for any input!

Normally when people have their lights on in my area, they tip at least something. \nSo I get up to the door and greet the man and what not and have him sign the credit card receipt. I give him his gluttony and get back to my car. I noticed he just signed his name and didn't put anything in the tip of total lines. So I just assume he wasn't going to tip and I put the address in the folder of non-tippers in the back of my mind. I see him come running out. Asks me if he finished signing the credit card receipt. I tell him yes he signed it. He asks for the receipt and a pen so I hand it to him and he walks back to his porch. At this point I'm thinking he's going to add a tip to the card, because that has happened a few times before. So I get out of my car and follow him back and he hands me the receipt. I'm very nice to him because I think he just tipped me. Get back to my car and there's a fat zero on the tip line. I felt so much disappointment and a little anger. \n\nTL;DR: customer stiffs me, asks to finish signing the credit card slip later and stiffs me again. ",

Instead, she just looks at me and smiles saying \"That's your tip!\" playfully gesturing at the little thing desperately trying to get my attention. I smile and politely chuckle while waiting for her to sign the slip authorizing us to charge her credit card, then head out. This woman wrote a big fat zero on the tip portion, which sure not getting tipped sucks, and I try not to let it get on my nerves. But this woman just made me so angry! She lets her runt of a dog jump all over me, and still actually jokes about the fact that she isn't going to tip. Who does that?",

Say I get a very large order, like $80 or more, I take the time to deliver it perfectly, everything is there and correct, and I even unpacked everything in the house after taking multiple trips to and from my truck. At that point, they are polite and pay for the food with a credit card slip. Welp, no tip at all. At this point I would also like to mention that I am beloved by all the managers at my store, and any complaint from a customer (as long as I didn't do anything egregious) would likely result in them taking my side. In that situation, if I said something like \"Excuse me, I don't mean to be rude, but this is a huge order with a lot of extra hassle. Seeing as how I really need tips to survive on this little money, could you perhaps consider tipping even a small amount?\", would I be in the wrong? Would you ever do that? I feel like if it is a ridiculous enough situation, the customers are polite, and I am very polite about it, that may work just fine.",

        "text": "So this is really a story of beef between my boss and a customer, but told from my perspective, a driver.\n\nSo this guy calls the store, and my boss answers. It should be noted that our store has several reviews talking about how shitty my boss was to them or how bad the customer service from him was. Normally he doesn't answer the phones because of this, but he was the only one available so he took the order. Order placed, made, packed, and sent out via me with instructions saying that the order was actually to a parked semi truck, not the house the address would otherwise suggest. New, but otherwise easy enough.\n\nI get to the place, and after a bit of walking around aimlessly with my phone being used as a flashlight, I heard a honk. It was the truck. A black truck. With no lights on. At night. Tucked back from the road a good 30-40 feet. So, I walked over, and before I could say anything the customer just went off about how shitty the guy who ordered was to him and how badly he was treated. He got more and more angry, with me doing the stupid thing of agreeing with his thoughts of my boss both because they're partially true and hoping maybe if I made it clear I knew everything he was saying, I could get out of there faster. Eventually he came out with this gem (paraphrased, this was  awhile ago):\n\n\"Tell your boss to come out here and talk to me face to face, or I'll drive this truck straight into his shop!\"\n\nYeah this guy was WONDERFUL... After finishing the transaction and complimenting his truck (never actually seen the inside of one in person before), I started to leave. He got my attention again and gave me a note, telling me to give it to my boss. I opened it on my way back to the store. It was a legit death threat... luckily written on the back of the trucker's business card. Name, address, phone number, and company. Excellent.\n\nI gave it to the boss upon my return while telling him of that fun adventure, who immediately did what I was thinking of doing and reported it to the police. I don't know what came of it, but we've never heard from that customer since. I presume he just drove off the next morning.",

        "text": "I was working what was supposed to be an inside shift, covering for a kitchen worker, when my store was suddenly inundated with deliveries. For several hours, I had to take back-to-back-to-back double deliveries, which is good in terms of making some money. It is bad if you let your sister borrow your GPS and are depending on your phone, for which you do not have a charger available. Needless to say, in between the \"call when you get heres\" and unmarked houses, my phone died about a half hour before the end of my shift.\n\nI got back to the store to find a delivery up, the other three drivers out on deliveries of their own. I have no luck, so of course it was a delivery the next state over, in a rural area. I found it on the map, and left the store with my bag, hoping that it would be an easy delivery and I could just go home.\n\nI got to the house, the only one for miles, located right next to an abandoned former nursing home. All the lights were off, and I was getting a bad vibe about the whole thing. \n\nStill, I went up to the door and knocked, and was greeted by a man who claimed they'd blown a fuse. Okay, seems legit. I told him the total, and he said they'd called the store and paid with a credit card after I left.\n\nI had no way of verifying this, as my phone was dead.  People do this all the time, though. It is irritating, but they do it.\n\nBeing so far away from the store and just wanting to get out of there - knowing I would have to make fresh food and come back out there if he was telling the truth, I decided, stupidly, to take his word for it.\n\nNaturally, he had lied. It was a small delivery, about $14 total, but I wasn't happy about paying for his food, even if it was partly my own fault.\n\nFast forward a week later. Cash order came up for the same address, and what do you know, it was my turn. I got there and he tried the same thing. Told him hell no, and that the last time I got stuck paying for his food, turned around and walked back to my car.\n\nThe next day, the guy called in and said the driver never showed up, and our GM, not knowing any better, gave him a credit. I told the GM that was the guy who stiffed me, and we flagged the address. She personally called him to remove the credit, and let him know that any cash orders would henceforth have to be picked up by him, or paid for with a card.\n\nHe has tried several times to call from different numbers and rip us off. I later found out he had done the same thing to several other drivers in the store, but they had been too embarrassed to admit they'd been had until the shit hit the fan.",

It's a large double pepperoni and extra cheese pizza and an order of brownies. I take the delivery and pull up to the house right on time. When the customer answers the door I tell him his total is $22.85 and he says he didn't order any pizza. He does make a comment about it possibly being from last night (My store closes at 10pm on weekdays). It was an online order so I confirm that the address and name on the ticket was his. He confirms but insists that he didn't order the pizza. He offers to pay for the pizza anyway, but I tell him if he doesn't want it and didn't order it, we won't make him do that and that I'll just take it back to the store. As I turn to go back to my car, he says wait and hands me a $20.00 bill saying it's my tip. I repeatedly say he doesn't have to do this, but he insists and says \"you don't do this for free\". His total was only $22.85 so I ask if he wants the pizza again and again he said no. So I thank him and tell him to have a good day.  On my way back to the store I call my boss to explain what happened. Neither of us can make sense of it. But in the end, I got $20.0 and we got to eat the pizza. \n\nThe only conclusion we could come up with was that he ordered the night before after close while drinking and accidentally placed the order for the morning.

Fake St, he decided to try that house. Some customers don't specify if they live on North or South versions of the street, so we've had to deal with delivering to \"right\" wrong address before.\n\nThe guy was a very experienced driver, so he also knew to call the customer to verify the address. He called a few times on the trip to the other location, and left a voice mail, but the person never answered. Per unwritten policy, we leave our name and number so customers can reach us quickly. He also notified the store of the issue \n\n_____\n\nMeanwhile at the store the phone rings:\n\n&gt; Me: \"Thank you for calling PMH, how may I help you?\"\n\n&gt;Cust: \"Yes, I got a voice mail from someone claiming to be your driver with my pizza. He says he's trying to find where I live.\"\n\n\n&gt; Me: \"Yes, he notified us of the issue. You can call him back to rectify that.\"\n\n&gt; Cust: \"I just wanted to say that it is very inappropriate for him to do that. The shop should directly handle those calls. I'm not going to call him myself, but here's my correct address so you can tell him.\"\n\nTurns out she put down the wrong street… and the wrong street number… and she placed the order online.\n\nI was kind of flabbergasted at her comments, and the fact she put in the wrong address herself, but I text the driver the new information, and tell her that he should be on his way.\n\n________\n\nFive minutes later:\n\nThe phone rings again.\n\n&gt; Me: \"*Generic greeting*\"\n\n&gt; Cust: \"Your driver left me a voice mail again to find my apartment number. I told you that I find that inappropriate. I don't want random people calling me like that. Please tell him I'll be down in a few to get the pizza, and that his behavior is very disconcerting.\"\n\n&gt; Me: *while texting the driver the new information* \"…It's company policy to have drivers use their own phones to call customers. That's why we request phone numbers for the orders.\"\n\n&gt; Cust: \"Well I'm unhappy with you for this. The store should call me directly, not him.\"\n\nAfter courtesies were exchanged (the customer was very calm, even tempered, and… polite in both calls), the call ended.\n\nThe driver came back, and I told him about what the customer said to me about the calls, and he said that she chewed him out on it. She *politely* told him that she was not going to order from the company again, regretted the 20% tip, but that she hoped he had a good day.\n\nHe said that for a customer who was so irate, she was the polite customer he ever dealt with.\n\nTL;DR Customer thinks having the delivery driver call her is highly unprofessional and inappropriate. Exudes politeness that rivals satisfied customers.",

        "text": "So we have several regulars, as do most stores. One of ours is fairly far away, and since it's a known thing that I prefer further orders, I tend to be their delivery girl. It's an older couple, and as such we talk a bit every time they order, and they always tip nicely.\n\nOne day, after a somewhat stormy day, I delivered there. On my way to the house, I notice the rear end of a red sports car under a partially raised tarp. I've seen the tarp-covered car before, but never saw the car itself. I lifted the tarp a bit with my foot and read the rear emblem: Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4. I may as well have just uncovered a pile of gold bricks with how I reacted.\n\nBit of backstory, I love cars. I fell in love with cars from an early age starting with Hotwheels and Gran Turismo. I later fell in love with Ferraris, which spread to a ton of different cars. The first car I bought was a gorgeous 1983 RX-7, which I restored and daily'd. I've owned a number of cars, including a BMW 750Li, Ferrari 360 ($20k from a salvage yard, also restored), and my current Tesla, my first new car.\n\nAnyway, when I went to deliver the food, I asked about the VR-4. Turns out it was owned by their son who went into the Marines, and its been sitting ever since. After a number of phone calls, inspections, and generally befriending my customers, we settled on a price I could not refuse: $350. Of course, I had to get it towed, so I looked into prices and found it would be $150 to get it home. $500 for such a historical car? YES!!\n\nBut, it gets better. The day before I plan to hire a truck and buy the car, a guy comes by the store. He owns a towing service that recently moved in nearby, and has come to us for dinner a lot. This time, he came in talking about his RV and the audio work he needs done. The chef, knowing I work with audio stuff (I own a private recording studio), tells me to talk to the guy. He walks me over to his RV, explains what he wants done, and I agree to help. In return, he says he'll tow my newfound car for only $90. Score.\n\nThe next day, I do what he wanted, and he likes it. He also agreed to pay me $40 for my time and work. Soon after, we go to pick up my car. It all goes well, I pay the customer, and we're soon dropping off the car at my house. I give him the $90, but he remembers he didnt pay me for my RV work, so he gives me back $40. \n\nIn the end, I got a new project car for $400 delivered. And, tow guy said I can use his garage to work on it whenever I need it for free. All because my favourite pizza place needed a driver. It's not what you know, it's who you know. Use this job as a platform to meet people. You never know what you'll get out of it.\n\nIf youre curious, the car doesnt run, and I've yet to be able to turn the engine by any means, so now I'm rebuilding the engine. It's hard, what with all the rust and dry rotted rubber, but I see a lot of potential. And, rebuilding the engine means new camshafts, larger bore, new pistons, and all sorts of other tuning possibilities!",
