Or pricing? Or anxiety? Cross-cultural communication? Did you have to read a horrendous piece of mumbo-jumbo that snuck through peer-review and want to tell us about how bad it was? Need help finding the literature on topic Y and don't even know how where to start? Is there some new trend in the literature that you're noticing and want to talk about? Then this is the thread for you!\n",

Why would Hollywood stars have been shown in advertising abroad but not at home? \n\nMy assumption is that it would have lessened the exotic star appeal of Hollywood actors to associate them with consumer products, and that they must retain an air of glamour beyond usual habits of consumption. At some point this shifted, where it became normalized to associate celebrities with products in the US. \n\nWhat was the reason for these cultural differences in advertising and celebrity culture?

        "text": "Again and again I seen sociologists, historians, anthropologist and other experts state tribalism is one of the prime factors thats responsible for warcrimes, slavery, and other atrocities.\n\nIndeed the worst acts by humanity you can find in are often caused by groups that are so patriotic or so enamored by by their country's glory. Just as equally responsible are ethnic tensions in which a group like Gypsies commit crimes in the name of avenging an act some Turks did centuries ago. Hell to use the latter example, some tribal identities are so imbued with other large-scale group identities (such as Turks being Muslims and being more Middle-Eastern in culture than most Europeans) that even if you're not that ethnic group or nationality but share traits associated with said ethnicity, you'll be attacked under the claim that you're an Italian by Libyans simply because you're a Roman Catholic (even though you're nationality is Swedish, a culture so different from Italian).\n\nStories of gangs going outside the border of a country to rape and loot other nations still happen to this day.\n\nBut there is one thing I am curious about.\n\nHow come cases of savage violence over tribal identities that are far smaller and less emphasized so rare?\n\nWhat I mean is for example you don't see New Yorkians going to New Jersey and raping New Jersey women because they're so proud to be New Yorkian. Nor do you hear stories about someone living in Diego traveling to burn another San Francisco resident's home because San Francisco had a minor feud with San Diego back in the days of the wild west.\n\nI mean if you mention the idea of a small nuclear family murdering members of another nuclear family simply because their great great grandpa stole a basket of apple from the begrudging family's great great grandma from 1901 would make any sensible person today (especially in democratic country) laugh out loud.\n\nNow I am aware certain parts of the world have tribes fighting each other like in Afghanistan. As well as inter-region conflicts\n\nBut despite being labeled as tribes, they are actually more accurately described as ethnic group because of vast differences and numbers. And these regions within nations attacking each other are large enough to be their own nations (such as Yugoslavia). They never wanted to be a single country in the first place but were forced into it is another reason they don't apply as \"smaller scales of tribal identity\".\n\nI mean I remember months ago there was a feud between two local store owners (both white and Christian Americans) in the news and one of the store owners began to kill not only other employees but even people who went to that specific store. His reasoning? \"They have started a feud with me for being a customers at another store so they're members of another race and I'm racist against people who shop at any store that isn't mine!\"\n\nEveryone at worked fucking laughed so hard we were choking. I know its a grave matter but just the thought of killing other people because they shop at another store and they're bigoted at \"people who shop at those stores\" and they're beneath human because they are a member of the that race. Implying people who shop at any other store is a different race and deserved to be killed even if they're 100% white, Christian and American all simply because they choose to shop else where...... Was something me and my co-workers cannot comprehend and found so hilarious.\n\nI mean we are already familiar with stuff like American soldiers doing warcrimes in the Iraq in the name of their country, Germans killing Jews simply because they're Jewish in race (even though Judaism is a religion), blacks holding grudges against whites for slavery and Jim Crow, and other large scale \"serious\" tribal identities that encompass major populations.\n\nBut the notion of \"killing someone who is not of my tribe\" because those customers shop at the rival store (despite the fact they also shopped at your store before)?\n\nIt was too ridiculous to take seriously.\n\nBut thats what inspried me to ask this question. I mean even in Romeo and Juliet, while the Capulets and Montagues while they did murder each other (and those were participatory fights in which both parties were guilty off and fair-face-to-face brawls).......\n\nNot once did a Capulet rape a Montague or did a Montague specifically killed a child for being of Capulet descent. The fact it was only a few rough rowdies who participated in actual fights (and who were already shown to be violent people in general, starting shit with people other than the Montague and Capulets) proves that the Capulet and Montague had some sort of code that dictated how far they could go in their feud.\n\nI mean this is oppose to large identities like those ethnic groups in Yugoslavia. Prior to the war breaking out, individual Serbians were already setting arson to innocent Croats and Bosnian homes. Bosnians were already forming gangs and jumping innocent Serbian bystanders just walking on the street. Croats were not above looting easy targets like isolated Albanian stores.\n\nYou don't see such violence caused by the Capulet and Montague feud. Nor do you see such willingness to execute violence because of less emphasized identities.\n\nJust the notion of a Sicilian throwing explosives at Venetians home because he hates Venetians for being born in Venice is just so ridiculous that people would laugh at such a crime of \"tribalistic\" identity and \"racism\".\n\nI am curious why is this? I mean my friends and I (and well in fact the general populace) aren't surprise at blacks attacking whites or Muslims attacking Jews and other similar macro identity of large scale composing millions of people and beyond regions. But the general populace (including myself and my friends) would really find the notion of say gamers shooting other gamers because of \"tribalism\" and Turks living in Anatolia raping another Turk because he's from Cyprus as ridiculous and beyond stupid.\"",

        "text": "Posted under \"Theory\" as I have yet to discover a sociological term for this concept.\nIn psychology, we all learned about cognitive dissonance. Consistency Theory suggests that when our inner systems (beliefs and values etc) aren't supported by external evidence we feel this dissonance. Short of changing our belief systems or behavior we may engage in a slew of shitty fixes: Denial, rationalization, persuasion, transcendence etc. Do we have a similar term in sociology? For the same thing but on a sociological level? I can't find it. Indulge me a bit -I have always felt the trend/flavor of a given culture's crime reflected a lot about a culture. America has a sad, newer trend of mass killings and while many people are rightfully focusing on the psychology of these killers, something else is playing out. America is easily envisioned as a person itself. At the very least, America comes with a general narrative and claims it's values strongly. All of us carry a piece of that identity. What happens when the narrative of something as large as a country does not match it's own 'behavior'? Many would argue our systems and institutions leave a lot to be desired when compared to America's values (school, churches, laws, enforcement, policies, politics etc). I'd suggest that a culture or nation in dissonance would see some very unusual behaviors and crimes trend out. Especially in the institutions and places that most embody the values/narrative. Those unusual behaviors would be versions of the 'shitty fixes' I listed above but also played out in larger arenas of the social sphere (politics, entertainment, media etc). A person cannot easily change the identity or practices of a society. If the identity of a nation are so aggrandized while so far misaligned, would we not see an increase in people engage in acts against society itself ( such as indiscriminate killing en mass). Are some people not born with a greater sense of entitlement to that claimed identity (i.e., white men). I think it would explain a lot. Also -Back to my question. Narrative dissonance-like in video games seems close to what I'm thinking. But do sociologists have a theory/word for this?",

Something that makes them disgard any sense of morality or conscience until they are either captured or commit suicide themselves\n\n *(and the media always tries to come up with as many other scapegoats that they can like fascination with guns, use of video games and so on, meaning that relying on what the media says is irrelevant and untrustworthy)*\n\nSo for anyone who has studied about this, is there any possible link that any kind of mental disorder or pathology of some kind has a link between gun violence or any kind of violence in general?\n\n**EDIT - With the research that I did so far, it seems that those who are victims of mental disorders are more likely to be victims of violence, rather than the perpetrators of violence and I found that a common factor that makes people more likely to commit such acts is when they use psychotropic drugs. So this may mean that substance abuse of some kind *(which is also a mental disorder according to the DSM)* is involved. But is it possible that this is evident among all or in a majority of the shootings that happened in the U.S.? Most of the shooters were teenagers so I guess use of drugs or substances is a possibility considering that experimentation or thrill-seeking is usual during adolescence but there must be something else that triggers or drives these people to commit such acts from those who may exposed to certain substances but do not plan commit such crimes**",

I want to know what camps are out there.\n\nTo clarify what I mean by political ethics... say you're a king of some country. Under what circumstances can you kill one of your own citizens, while still being a good king? When and how much can you collect taxes, while still being a good king? When can you go to war, while still being a good king? If another king was slaughtering their own people, under what circumstances would a good king do something, and what would they do? When do you allow your citizens to murder one another, what attempts can you make to stop them, and what are the limits to these attempts if you want to remain a good king? And can you, and how much can you, and in what ways can you, as a good king, prevent your people or other people from removing your kingship? Possibly more questions can be added.\n\nIn the first camp, you'd say the king can do literally everything in all scenarios with no limit whatsoever and they are still a good king irrespective of their actions. In the second camp, there are some limits in some scenarios on what a good king can do. If a king violated ant of those limits, that king would be not be a good king.\n\nSimply put, if you know of any authors who wrote about some viewpoint (related to those questions), a very brief overview and their name would be precisely what I am looking for. Alternatively, if there are entire camps with proper names concerning this subject, that camp's name and a very brief overview of what distinguishes their belief from others would be excellent.",

I was hoping a gun expert can direct me to the most important studies and meta-analyses on gun control. I'm an economist, so I'm fairly knowledgeable of econometric methods and causal inference. I have also already read Lott's More Guns, Less Crime. \n\nMy understanding is that overall, the evidence is mixed. I know there was a recent meta-analysis published in *Epidemiology,* but my reading of it found their results inconclusive (they mention that  most of the papers only found correlations and had models sensitive to specification, so I'm not sure why they knowingly included all these subpar studies). I've also run into a bunch of public health papers; I guess its in vogue to treat gun control as a public health issue now. But so far, most of my cursory glances of these studies show weak methodology that over-relies on p-values instead of causal research designs. My goal is to determine a consensus, even if weak. Do guns reduce crime, increase crime, or do nothing? \n\nAlso, I'd also appreciate some informal knowledge from gun researchers. That is, tell me what the informal opinion of you and your colleagues are, even if these opinions haven't been established with research yet. Do most of you support more gun control, or do you and your colleagues argue a lot? As per subreddit rules, you would also need to provide some rigorous papers, since a top post can't just be anecdotes. I guess provide some important studies, then add a note about your informal observations?\n\nTo clarify, I AM NOT looking for people to google \"gun control studies,\" then post the top links with a cursory explanation. I'm looking for gun experts to give me a crash course on gun control research, since the opportunity cost is too high for me to become an expert myself. \n\nThanks!",

The frequent stereotypes were jocks wearing letterman jackets and playing sports, nerds in glasses and button-up shirts; this dichotomy can be seen as early as *death of a salesman* which took place in 1948 and described high school in the late 1930s, and which has been depicted in popular culture more or less unchanged since then.  Other, more ephemeral subcultures were the greasers of the 1950s and 1960s, the hippies of the 1960s and early 1970s, the goths of the 1980s, and the hip-hop subcultures from the '90s to the 2000s.  The 2000 film *Ten things I hate about you* parodied the concept early in the movie by having everyone belong to a small, distinct clique with its own aesthetic.\n\nHowever, since the early 2010s, there appears to be a decline not only in individual subcultures, but in the presence of subcultures in general.  Vice called the \"Emo\" of the late 2000s decade [\"the last true subculture\"](https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/59bwj5/emo-was-the-last-true-subculture), although I personally recall the smaller \"scene\" subculture stuck around for one or two years longer.

As with all our weekly features (Theory Wednesdays and Friday Free-For-Alls are the others), this thread will be lightly moderated.\n\nSo, encountered an recently that changed article recently that changed how you thought about nationalism? Or pricing? Or anxiety? Cross-cultural communication? Did you have to read a horrendous piece of mumbo-jumbo that snuck through peer-review and want to tell us about how bad it was? Need help finding the literature on topic Y and don't even know how where to start? Is there some new trend in the literature that you're noticing and want to talk about? Then this is the thread for you!\n",

        "text": "In most conversations about oppressed and marginalized groups, the term 'minority' seems to work best as a description because the groups are generally a smaller percentage of the overall collective group being described. However, I find that 'minority' isn't usually the most accurate description and sometimes leads to confusion, and the confusion compounds further misunderstandings in discussions about race dynamics.\n\nFor example, when someone is trying to make an argument about oppressed groups in the US, they tend to explain that minorities have a disadvantage (racism) within society. In this explanation, minorities are at a disadvantage simply because of their relative size to the general population.\n\nBut this explanation about majority vs minority breaks down when is comes to *true* racism. We all agree that African Americans face racism in America, but if we were to have a discussion about racism in Atlanta, it wouldn't make sense to call African Americans minorities in Atlanta because they are 54% of the population in Atlanta while European Americans are 38%, yet they still face racism.\n\nAnother case would be in any country in Asia. While people of European (White) descent do and may face racism in Asia, they tend to receive better treatment than a 'minority' typically would in more White dominant countries - this statement used only to point out the difficulty of using the word 'minority' in this situation. The misunderstandings come from the use of 'minority' as a synonym for oppressed and marginalized groups and its literal meaning - I've participated in conversations where White people who have been to Asia use the argument about being a minority yet still somehow coming out on top.\n\nWhile there are probably tons of a opinions on whether or not my last paragraph is fair, correct, generalizing, I'm skipping over the nuances of this touchy subject not because I think it's unimportant but to get to my main question which is, what is a better term to call people who are marginalized or oppressed, even when they are the majority of the given area? And is there a term we can use universally rather than relatively.",
