In order to use this API though, I would need to place on the machine from where I scan the API key which gives full access, so it's not great.\n\nWhat tools do you use to make this easier? How do you (and did you?) automate the host acquisition process? Do you use openVAS (I found it quite unfriendly to configure) or some professional service (Nessus or such)?\n\nAny tip or idea is very appreciated!\n\n",

The general advice I've read on the internet is to get experience in Network engineering or System administration before jumping into infosec. Been practicing exploiting the boxes for 6 months, I see system administration as a step-down. Not that I don't appreciate the work they do, but I'd like to move into Infosec right after my graduation. I have a mini oscp like local certification(limited to my country, India) but I am planning to take my OSCP soon. Would love to hear your opinion on this. \n\nI can write hacker level code (not formatted properly with design patterns but works nonetheless :p) ",

What are some good questions I could put together in a survey monkey style quiz to get a snapshot of how we would all score?\n\nI've got a few already, but to give you an idea, something like:\n\n* An email arrives with pdf attachment and subject \"URGENT: Final Delivery attempt for Tacking# IN69378565AU. Con Note attached\". Do you:\n 1. Delete it.\n 1. Email everyone asking who is expecting a package.\n 1. Ask someone else to open it.\n 1. Everything looks ok but to be sure open the pdf on your smartphone first.\n 1. Check the reply to address and if it checks out it should be safe.\n\n* An email arrives purporting to be from Netflix claiming you credit card is invalid. It has a helpful link to take you to the accounts page to fix. Do you:\n 1.  Forward it to whomever pays the bills.\n 1.  Click the link and login.\n 1.  Ignore it because you know your credit card number is working and valid.\n 1.  Go to netflix.com in your browser and login and check for alerts.\n 1.  Click on the link BUT put the wrong password in first time.\n\n* An email arrives from an unfamiliar address with some picture content that has not yet been downloaded by outlook. Its addressed to your boss but has come in on a shared email address, should you:\n 1.  Download the missing content so you can reveal its message.\n 1. Forward to your boss on his direct email address explaining.\n 1. Click \"Open this message in your browser\".\n 1. Its spam clearly, so hit 'unsubscribe'.\n 1. Its spam so move it to your spam folder.\n\nNOte: these are quite easy, i would love to throw a few in there that are tricky and teach ppl at the same time, and/or set up 1/2 marks for \"safe but not best\".\n\nAnd my first 3 are all email based, I would love ones about keeping PII, password methodology, questioning strangers in your office etc.\n\nContributions? I'll share the final survey monkey on here in a week or 2! :-)",

This partition will also store data that do not require encryption (like music or movies).\n\nWhat I would like to get (ideally): after turning PC on, there should be nothing but a password field. There should be two passwords and depending on which of them was entered, either Windows 7 or Linux must boot. Empty password should boot Windows 10.\n\nSo the question is how do I make all this work properly? What tools and in what sequence should I use? Should I use hardware encryption for SSD and VeraCrypt for HDD?\n\n(According to what I read, storing password of hardware encrypted SSD in BIOS/UEFI (which is a default way) is unacceptable for security reasons, not only because BIOS/UEFI manufacturers have master-password, but also because in many ways they handle SSD password improperly (like create password cache or actually use different password etc.), making it easy for third party to decrypt your SSD. So storing password in BIOS/UEFI is effectively equal to not encrypting SSD at all.\nI heard about \"sedutil\" for this case. How reliable is it? Or maybe there is something better I'm not aware of?)\n\nShould I create two partitions on SSD for both Linux and Win7? Or use SSD entirely for only one (which?) of them?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",

Fast forward a couple months into the job I'm realizing that all I will be doing is being a log monkey looking at ArcSight events and escalating to clients (was not aware it was for an MSSP originally when I accepted the offer).\n\n\nI feel a little confused since I was always under the impression that security centered roles required significant more systems/networking knowledge to be proficient at. Instead, I found myself surrounded (most, not all) by a bunch of T1 type people who came straight from helpdesk, many of which have never even touched a server or a switch outside of resetting someone's AD password. \n\n\nMy previous experience is in Azure, systems/network administration and engineering. Actually implementing DLP, MFA, configuring firewalls, VPNs and whatnot. Now I feel like I'm the boy who cried wolf notifying clients when there is something that \"might\" be amiss because I see some random IP address port scanning every IP known to man despite no successful connections. \n\n\n\n\nDid I make the wrong choice here? Is this a waste of my time? Should I start putting my resume out again and maybe hope for a security engineering role or something? This is my first job with the word \"security\" in the title but I have done so much more actual security work in my other roles. These people I work with know nothing about the technology they're supposed to monitor for suspicious activity.\n\n\nOn the plus side is that the company's MSSP is turning into a corporate SOC and I think the MSSP portion of it is going away so MAYBE I'll get to do something more interesting?... It pays better than my last job so I guess thats a plus too.\n\n\nI understand that security is a \"big\" field and theres lots to learn but am I gaining anything valuable from this role? It feels like I just do a fraction of what I did at my last job (monitoring for alerts) but get paid more for some reason.",

        "text": "Hey guys, \n\nI'm a cyber security major and lately I've been getting more interested in anonymity when joining a network. I have a computer with Windows 10, and was curious if anyone could help me figure out what's being sent from my device that could be used to identify me or my machine on the network. The obvious one's to me are my hostname, and my MAC address. I found an interesting script that randomizes both of those on every windows boot, but surely that isn't everything. I've read up on things like NetBIOS and others that can be run on a network, and wanted to receive information on similar methods or tools that would help me achieve basically becoming a brand new device on a network on each boot. I know that full anonymity isn't possible, but would like to get as close as possible to it.\n\nAny help or info would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",

It seems as though development has basically stopped for that tool, which got me interested in what else is available and popular these days. I instantly ran across King Phisher, which stills seems to be getting relatively frequent updates. Does anyone have a perspective on these open source tools or other ones I'm not aware of? What does King Phisher bring to the table that Phishing Frenzy is lacking?\n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://github.com/pentestgeek/phishing-frenzy\n\nhttps://github.com/securestate/king-phisher",

I know 2016 and win10 have it disabled by default, but I'm trying to find any systems that currently have it enabled in my enviroment.   Other than running mimikatz on each system, I dont see an easy way.  Thanks in advance.",

We got login and password for their site, which I considered a little bit odd (why not allowing me to choose the password?), but what made me even more surprised is that due to security reasons, they sent me login and password via the same channel (mail), in two messages. Is there any potential reason to do likewise?",

        "text": "Hi r/AskNetSec,\n\nI was reviewing a potential infection today that involved lsass.exe and I found myself wondering about the hash value of that process. I took the MD5 of lsass.exe from multiple hosts and noticed that they were different. Is this an OS specific thing, or does lsass.exe always have a different MD5 values per host? \n\nAdditionally, are there any good resources out there that anyone has come across that show the hash values and other low level internal workings of Windows Processes? I have been meaning to pickup a copy of Windows Internals, is that a good source? In the meantime, does anyone have any good PDFs or links they wouldn't mind sharing?\n\nThanks in advance for any insight. I took a peak on Google and couldn't find a ton of specific information on lsass.exe and other Windows processes. ",
