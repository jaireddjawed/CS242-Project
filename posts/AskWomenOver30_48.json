My father and brother said it's gross to be seen in that way, and they stopped meeting up with me alone.\n\nMy friends always act very awkward, like they don't know how to behave. I told them it doesn't matter what others think, but they are bothered by it because \"it's unrespectful towards their boyfriends\".\n\nSo I'm wondering: is this just how people's minds work or am I doing something that makes people think  I'm a couple with however I'm with at that moment?",

It was lashes, so my eyes were closed, and by the time the service ended I didn't know what to say and just wanted to go.\n\nI've never complained at a salon before and what she did wasn't bad, it just wasn't what I asked for. But when I left I angry cried, and I am embarrassed because that is not her fault. I am having a very difficult time with the holidays this year. I will be alone, and have been before, but the reason this time is so upsetting that I have just been waiting for the day to come and go already. I called the salon, they told me to come back at 4, and for some reason I just feel embarrassed even though I did not get upset in front of anyone. I guess this made me just upset enough for everything else to come out. I don't know the etiquette for coming back and having something redone. I feel badly and don't want her to think I've gotten fragile over a set of eyelashes. Guess I am looking for advice on salon etiquette, and christmas meltdowns.",

I'm looking for some guidance as I've realized it's time to (literally) put on some big-girl panties.\n\nSince I was a teenager I've been buying my underwear almost exclusively from Aerie- their undies were comfortable, cute, and fit me well. I loved them! The last time I went to stock up though, I had a very hard time finding any pairs I liked. It seemed like all they had were Gen Z styles... which, you know, makes sense, because obviously stores like Aerie are for teens and twenty-somethings. Anyway, I figured I should take that ill-fated shopping trip as a sign that it's time to get my 33-year-old butt in some adult underwear. \n\nAre there any other former Aerie die hards out there who have found a more grown-up brand that you love just as much?",

        "text": "Wondering if I'm alone in this or if there's anyone or any articles out there that can maybe help me put this into better words.\n\nMy husband and I, both 35, will be married for nine years this coming spring. He's a supportive, loving and involved partner and father to our two small children. I love him and am grateful for him. Of course, there are things that upset me - he's a slob, for one - but what seems to trigger me the most is sleep.\n\nHe's a night owl and I'm an early riser. It's always been that way. When we were first living together and married, I spent so many weekend mornings by myself, getting chores done, running errands or just lounging. It was lonely and if I let him sleep until he woke up, it would be noon before he'd be showered and functional. It felt like the day was already over. Many of the household must-dos were already done.\n\nI started getting resentful of his sleep pattern. I didn't think it was my responsibility to wake him up and ask him to help with the chores. So I just did them and then got mad about it. He didn't understand why we couldn't do them together later in the day. Fair enough. We were always just at a standstill on that.\n\nThen we had kids. I'm always the one up with them first thing. I tend to them overnight if they cry, not because my husband won't (he's the best dad) but because he sleeps right through their cries. If I wake him and ask him to get them, he will. But again - I have enough responsibility in my life. Waking and asking him feels like added responsibility and like I am in charge of a third person. My resentment has grown. \n\nTonight, both absolutely exhausted, we were in the playroom with the kids and he laid on the couch and closed his eyes. It upset me - I dont get to just close my eyes. It felt like he was leaving me to watch the kids with no warning. \n\nThen later, he put our son to bed. While I waited for him to come downstairs, I waned up dinner, wiped down the table, cleaned the high chair, made lunches for tomorrow. Before I knew it I did the whole list of things. Turns out he fell asleep. I was pissed and we fought. He told me his sleep had always triggered me. I just want him to see how frustrating it is that I am the default parent in every way and his sleeping through these things is upsetting. \n\nI don't know. Help?",

Yesterday we were talking and I told him that while he was half asleep the other night he confessed that I am his 'one', and how sweet that was. He chuckled and replied with \"you are my one--- right now---at the moment. So long as things don't change, you will be that! :)\". I was confused and kinda irritated. It's not that relationships don't take work to work, its that it felt irrelevant for him to say what he did, and the way he worded that made me feel like he was trying to keep me from being 'too' confident in the future of our relationship. He told me something like...\n\n \" I dont mean it that way, Im just saying you can't control the future or what happens. You are the only one I want, I want to marry you and be with you forever but that doesn't mean we will be with each other forever. Nothing is certain. Like, what if you get into an accident and died or something changes and one of us leaves the other for some unforeseeable reason? I don't believe that will happen, but I can't say it won't cause I can't predict the future, nor can you. That's how my practical mind works and that's why I worded it that way. \"You're the one\" and \"You're the one right now\" mean the same thing\".\n\n He thinks I am just looking too far into how he worded it and being pessimistic, and says he's frustrated cause I'm just focusing on what he said and not his explanations. I replied back that I don't feel like I was overanalyzing, and that I am listening, it's just that his reasoning doesn't make sense. \n\n\nSo, am I overanalyzing and not seeing the big picture here or is this really as strange as I perceive it?",

        "text": "I was with a man for 4 years. We were best friends, soul mates, everything was amazing. Except for unequal distribution of household labour. At the end I had to work 40 hours per week, study 3-6 hours per day for my licensing exams and take 2 university classes online so I told him I needed things to change. Either we needed to just make a chore board (no good, he didnt want me to feel like his mother - as if I didnt begging him to step up to our home together for the last 4 years) or we needed to just buy our own groceries and cook our own meals etc. for the year while I was going to be so busy (no because that doesnt feel like we're a family). So we ended things because I saw no way of doing everything I had to do with a dependant. \n\nIm sharing this part because I think it may be relevant. A week before we broke up he asked if I ever read his journal. I said of course not. He said it was fine if I did but he just wanted to know. At the time of the break up I was out of town and he had come to visit me. When he left post break up he left his journal right front and centre on the kitchen island... there was nothing else there so it wasn't hard to see. I assumed it had been left for me and read it (after several hours of questioning his motives). In it it said he thinks he is gay. I phoned him crying as soon as I was done, not crying because of us but because he felt he had to keep such a big secret and that I would always support him no matter what. \n\nWe talked through things a bit and he said he was bi and that was the end of it. We didn't talk for 7 months until I had to put my dog down. I gave him a courtesy call and he asked if I wanted him to travel 7 hours to be with me for this. I said that while it is new, I had just met someone who was going to support me and my best friend was going to come from out of town to be with me. He sent me all the photos he had of me and my dog and that was that. We chatted on the phone a few times around then just casual friend stuff because I always assumed we would be good friends one day.\n\nAbout a month later I get a text telling me to dispose of my engagement ring because it kept us connected. He didnt want it back but he wanted it gone. Im a gem collector and its a one of a kind stone so I said no but that I would be happy to take the stone out and have it reset and send him back the gold (it was a lot of gold). He winds up sending me the most cruel message I have ever received and it shocked me. I figured he was just hurting and maybe was surprised I had moved on when he may have been thinking we get back together or something, I dont know. I didnt reply to the message and we didnt speak again.\n\nAbout a year later I moved back to the city we were in and shot him a note saying I was there and would he like to meet. He sent me an unkind message back (not mean, just not kind) so I dropped it. A year after that I bought a house and while I was packing to move I found a magazine where he is on the cover. Its a stupid Air Canada magazine so he has no chance in tracking another down so again I just sent a note saying, \"found your magazine, I am happy to mail it to you as I believe it would have sentimental value\". He told me to dispose of it in again an unkind way and said he was blocking me from emailing him or contacting him in the future. At this point I'm completely baffled.. its been years. He reached out to his ex every 6 months when we were together looking for closure she wouldn't give, I know he processes slowly and takes a long time to heal so I couldn't figure out why hed turn away that opportunity with me. \n\nSo I broke up with the guy I was seeing a while ago and obviously my past relationship came up in therapy while we were looking for my patterns and she said his response was that I broke his heart, as simple as that. It really shed some light on things, from my perspective he didnt want to be a team with me and was questioning his sexuality so of course we werent together but I deeply respected him as a person and held no grudge against him. He felt betrayed by me. I thought he was angry at the flippant way I approached becoming friends when he was hurting so much.\n\nHe had unblocked me on facebook sometime in the last year, Im really not sure when as I never check it but I went online today and saw I was unblocked so I just sent a note saying I recognise now that I was unkind and wanted to apologise for how I treated him and the way I was insensitive and that his new partner looks lovely and I genuinely hope he is happy. I sent this via email. After receiving the email he blocked me again on facebook. Ok fine, point taken and I wont reach out again but is it wrong that Im finding this behaviour odd? 7 months post break up we're good to go to be friends then out of the blue the ring needs to go, then he doesnt want to see me, fine, but a year later I find something I KNOW he valued and he doesn't want to receive it in the mail no contact? Then well over a year after that he has clearly unblocked me on email (or never blocked me to begin with) and has unblocked me on facebook which indicates to me on some level he wants to hear from me or hed just stay separated. \n\nThe bond we had was something for the ages. We truly were soul mates and did everything together and loved all the same things. We shared everything, I know how he grieved the relationship that ended before me, how he still had a little piece of his heart tangled up in every woman hed ever been with tbh. He once reached out to his first gf from college to see how she was and she said she wanted nothing to do with him and that shredded him for weeks. I just cant figure out where this animosity is coming from unless he doesn't want anyone to know about the bi thing? Thats all I got. Insights appreciated.",

She refused to empathize and see it from my experience/perspective. She even accused me of using this as an excuse and threw out a personal trauma that I recently experienced as a weapon to hurt me. \n\nThis just happened last year and I’m still emotionally triggered at the thought of having to tell her that I don’t feel safe driving in these conditions (especially when we are warned not to). \n\n\nI know I need to be ok with my decision and not let her reaction dictate my choices. At the end of the day, I don’t feel safe and if I get into an accident on the road, that will be something I will have to deal with on my own. \n\nI’m just wondering if anyone has experienced something similar and if you have any advice or encouragement. \n\nThanks for reading!",

He is smart, he just doesn’t always have much to say, he is a ‘go with the flow’ kind of guy. \n\nWhen I think about it, none of the men I have been in relationships with have been great conversationalists - this is something I would love to have in a relationship, but it seems crazy to end a relationship with someone who otherwise has all the things I’m looking for. Would love to know everyone’s thoughts? \n\nSide note - I wonder if the men who really ‘turn my crank’ intellectually, are the ones that I might tend to scare off because I am excited to talk to them? I have ADHD, so it’s entirely possible I get over excited when speaking with people I really enjoy talking to about deeper topics and ‘big ideas’.",

        "text": "Wife upset and doesn’t seem to want to work on things.\n\n\nMy wife and I have been together for 11 years, married for 1. About a month ago I noticed more that things weren’t going well. She seemed depressed, withdrawn, etc. So I asked what was going on, and we ended up in a bit of a fight. We don’t scream at each other but things may get louder. I brought up my concerns and she brought up hers - that I don’t help around the house, she doesn’t feel like she gets the emotional needs that she is looking for, etc. She took two weeks away from me to visit friends and family and just got back in last night, and we talked for hours. I told her that I’m willing to try and change and that I can see how she feels and that I need to make more of an effort to be the friend and husband she needs and listen to her, help her around the house, show her I care,etc. I came up with the idea of a chart to split the chores and keep each other accountable, to set aside Time everyday to talk about work and life, to create date nights, to also have much needed time apart (we both work from home and are around each other 24/7 as we moved to a new state and Dont have any friends.) So I though we should both have a day or two a week out doing something we enjoy that would potentially bring us closer together as we would Have something to talk about, I brought up marriage counseling, that way there would be someone to mediate. But she doesn’t seem open to any of this, it seems like she is done and is just afraid to say it. I told her that I feel like I am putting more value into our marriage with wanting to fight to make it work and that it seems like she doesn’t care, and she tells me that she has tried to talk before and nothing changed (we may have had small little events but never a sit down deep rooted conversation.) she tells me that she doesn’t talk to me because she is afraid I will get mad, and that she shouldn’t have to tell me how she is feeling and that I should just know and she shouldn’t have to tell her husband how to treat her. I realize there are a lot of things I could do better and I am willing to work on them. It’s just seems like she doesn’t want to at all, she doesn’t want to do counseling because everything she has looked up says it doesn’t work ever here on Reddit. She tells me that she’s not happy, and not in love with me anymore, but she does love me. She said she wouldn’t know how to move forward with falling in love again; I told her that the way things have happened it’s been one thing that snowballs to another, I don’t help, she’s mad, stops talking; no sex, me depressed, me upset not wanting to help, her depressed etc it snowballs, and that’s didn’t end up here over night, and getting back to being in love won’t be overnight either. I love her to death and want to be the person she can lean on and talk to; and trust in. Unfortunately it’s got to this point. I don’t want to lose her because I generally believe we were meant to be together that she is my best friend. But I also don’t want to beg someone to be with me, but am I supposed to wait around for her to make her decision? I asked what she would want from me if things were good and she couldn’t answer. We moved to a new state thinking we would create a new life make new friends etc but that hasn’t happened and I think that’s a big part of our issue as well we have booth been depressed since our move not knowing anyone or being close to friends or family. We just bought our first home 1.5 years ago, we make decent money together, etc. it’s hard to put everything here i into words. What can I do? What should I do",

        "text": "I’ve struggled in my relationship with getting my needs consistently met. My bf is a lovely human and he does a lot of thoughtful things for me, we have a baseline of respect, support and love. \n\nBut: \n\n* Sex is infrequent (avg once per month) and he always turns me down if I initiate which of course makes me feel unwanted. We’ve discussed the “why” and there are some physical and emotional issues on his end that make it difficult for him to get and stay in the mood but we’ve been discussing this for like 3 years now and I don’t see sustained change AND we don’t discuss it unless I bring it up. \n* We have different ideas of quality time, both how much we each need and what QT entails. For him an hour in front of the tv together each night is more than enough. For me I need at least one or two deeper connections - like sitting and chatting for a couple hours over a glass of wine - per week to feel connected. \n* His attention is inconsistent. Sometimes I feel like his #1 priority, other times I feel like I don’t exist because he’s absorbed elsewhere (usually video games). \n* We talk a lot but it’s rarely beyond surface level, talking about work / our day or like, discussing upcoming plans. We only discuss the above issues (which he’s aware of) if I bring them up, and per bullet number 2 &amp; 3 I find it’s impossible to find good quality time to just organically discuss these things over time; I have to do the whole “HEY! We need to talk!” To get his attention which is exhausting. \n\nI’ve struggled this whole time trying to pin this on him but he’s over in his own little world with his needs met unaware that I cry myself to sleep a lot of nights. My contribution to this dynamic has been enabling his comfort and not speaking up for my needs more. I think I also haven’t accepted that this is who he is and I need to either accept him or, ya know, not. Move on. \n\nHe’s told me over and over (and I believe him) that he wants to meet my needs and shows up to these conversations when I bring it up yet seems oblivious as to why I would feel neglected when it’s been yet another full month without sex and he’s spent a total of appx 30 hours the last 7 days playing video games (he does not neglect work, exercise, etc just me 🤣🥹). I guess I’m just baffled because if I was aware of such major issues (especially our sex issues which is what I’ve communicated most about) I would be hot tailing it to find solutions and eager to work through it together via ongoing discussions and therapy. I’ve also expressed that we need to discuss it more and that I don’t always want to have to bring it up. Buuuuut no. \n\nHis go to phrase when I finally say I’ve been feeling neglected / lonely is “why didn’t you say something?” This was fine for a while until I realized I always have to say something.\n\nIm just coming to realize how vastly different our needs and expectations and even communication styles are and idk. I’m just sad. I feel hopeless. \n\nI love him so much but I feel chronically neglected. I also struggle with gaslighting myself because I start to think, am I blowing this all out of proportion? Is my past trauma making me overly triggered? Am I too needy?\n\nNot sure what I’m looking for here but thanks for listening.x",

        "text": "So, I'm new to this, and English is my second language so if i say it awkwardly, please bear with me.\n\n I'm currently have a few folks whose works I check before submitting to final approval before sending to clients. I like being helpful and supportive, and feel that if i happen to miss their mistakes and it makes it to the client, it's my full responsibility and I fail them. However, I'm not sure it's a reasonable expectation given the situation. \n\n It's first and foremost their work, they're full-time qualified workers. They're not new, but they're making a lot of careless/common sense mistakes and I'm stressed out that i might miss something and therefore, fail my duty. I also feel horrible if sometimes I miss things at the 1st check, and they in turn have to redo part of the work. I'd taken to repeat information multiple times, but still somehow the mistakes keep happening and I missed some of them because i was exhausted after checking multiple works with random and  repeating issues. So, it feels like the works are never done, and I feel very bad that it might make them feel discouraged. \n\nI checked with my supervisor and we agree that these are real, actual problems and not me being nitpicking or overly cautious. It's also acknowledged by my boss that people in this team are generally weaker than the average, and have issues. It doesn't make me feel any better though, I have gotten very stressed recently because they keep missing basic, common sense knowledge that I just have no way of expecting them not to know, or very casually ignoring the rules of the project, which only came to light when I rechecked (and thus they have to fix a big part of it because, well). I can't shake the guilt that i should have find all the issues on 1st check, which isn't realistic because i got bogged down with how many smaller mistakes there are. And well, they're capable members of the team, they should have check and follow the rules, or at least ask, but they don't. \n\nI guess, what I want to ask is, what would be appropriate boundaries in this situation? \n\nPart of me is very frustrated because it seems more new issues keep coming out of the left field, and old issues are repeated, works after works. They are not even new legitimate issues, they are really very basic and/or included in the brief. \n\nAnother is feeling terrible shame and anxiety because the issues are so random and unexpected, it's hard to catch them all. Also that I fail them for not be able to provide in advance every single explanation of every step in a fairly simple process with a full presentation and guide that they simply don't read, or don't refer to. They can ask me at anytime and I'm much happy to explain, or do whatever needed to get them their answers, too. This is really not a normal team, I'd been in the industry for more than a decade and this one is just ...strange. I'm so stressed out it's not even funny. Ex: guidelines said X needs to be red. The mistake: it's green, because apparently it's better. But they never confirm if it's ok, or even noted, they just do???  And it's for very basic, non-negotiable parts of the guideline. These things are hidden in dozens of smaller other mistakes, and I can miss them if i focus on catching all other careless issues. \n\nThe last part of me want to say fuck it and it's their works, they are responsible for ensuring the quality in the first place. This is what my boss usually says actually, that I'm supporting/overview and help catching the few mistakes escaping their attention, emphasis on FEW. And thus, if i miss something, sorry not sorry it shouldn't have been wrong in the first place. Which is kinda mean, but I'm at my wits end. Does anyone have any advice for me please?\n\nPs: I'm also near my period so my frustration could be overblown from it? But I'd been stressed for a few weeks, so it's a real issue :( and no, I'm not QC by trade, i have my own workload in addition to checking their works.",

If yes, how do I come to terms with being a selfless super mom in future like rest of the amazing ladies out there?",

The entire time he has created an elaborate lie about being a final year medical student, saying that he was studying for final exams, even faked specific questions from the exams, sent her photos of himself in scrubs, faked med school blood tests when she asked him to get an STD screening. Only now when he should have graduated has he come out and said he never went to medical school. He's an engineering drop out. She has been working in his state while they dated and was going to move there for him. She now wants him to move back to our home state with her so they can enroll in the same degree and pursue medicine together.\n\nI believe that this man is deeply disturbed to be able to maintain this lie for so long. I don't think she can trust him ever again and I fear for her safety. She says she still loves him. I am very worried.",

We've been close friends since but primarily communicate through text since I switched jobs and we live in separate states.\n\nI genuinely like her a lot. She's sweet, I like her sense of humor and she's just a good person. I also have a long time gf that I love, so I have no interest in my friend romantically.\n\nI'm looking for the perspective of other women. What can a man do or say to develop close platonic relationships with women and express how much they appreciate the friendship, without making them wonder if I'm wanting more? I'm open about my feelings and emotions and I value that in a friendship, but I worry that's too much for a platonic relationship with another women. I fear they'll think I'm emotionally cheating or wanting them around as backup. I feel bad for thinking this and have no intention of doing something like that ever. But I know from hearing from many other women that a lot of men do this and I understand that a women would want to be careful so they don't get hurt.\n\nI don't hint at wanting anything more (at least I don't think I do). I've never commented on her physical appearance. I talk to her about my gf and always in a positive way (or just neutral, like saying \"my gf and I went shopping yesterday.\" I talk to my gf about her (nothing private) just because my gf and I like telling each other about new friends.",

To keep things relatively concise, we got COVID in early June, my boyfriend's mom got very sick at the end of June and moved in with us (and is still living with us), my boyfriend has been extremely busy with work, my job is slowly eating away at my soul, and I think we're both generally a bit depressed. We keep fighting over the same thing which is that I feel emotionally disconnected from my boyfriend and he feels like he doesn't have the space he needs in our relationship. I want support from him when things are hard, and he wants space from me. Since things have been so hard lately, I think we're both really feeling this incompatibility (and maybe it's fundamental, I don't know yet). I definitely have a more anxious attachment style and he's more avoidant, but I've been working really hard to figure out my own shit and meet my own needs as much as possible.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't really done anything (and he admits this). He is very out of touch with his own feelings and often can't name what he's feeling, let alone describe why he feels a certain way. He keeps saying that our relationship used to be easy, and now it feels tense. I'm not feeling that -- there are definitely tense times, but I'd say on a day to day basis we get along pretty well -- so I ask him to tell me what he means and he can't. He also has no ideas for how to make it feel less tense/easier. I'm at a point where I feel like I've been trying really hard to work on my own issues that I've brought into the relationship and be a better partner, but he has no ideas and seemingly no interest in changing. He says he wants to be with me and hopes it's just a rough patch, but I'm like, how do you expect things to change when you don't make any changes?\n\nIs this a lost cause? Has anyone else had success with an emotionally distant partner? Thanks in advance!\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend is distant and unhappy in relationship but can't say why or what we can do to change it; doesn't want to break up",

My fiancé and I recently moved from an apt into our first (rental) home and I’m having the HARDEST time decorating. I feel like everything from my mid to late twenties (and even some recent purchases) feels so juvenile, but when it comes time to pick out fabric, drapery, rugs, lighting, anything… I have an identity crisis. It’s like I don’t know what I like anymore and I second-guess every design decision. My style has evolved from bohemian to a lot more cottagecore/English country/cozy chic…but I can never just ‘pick something out.’ Everything feels agonizing and honestly like I’m constantly trying to be someone I’m not. Not to mention buying something then realizing I hate it is draining my bank account and I’m sick of taking these risks for nothing. I even mood-boarded some recent purchases and still was like “wtf” once it was all together. \n\nAnd sadly this doesn’t stop at my design…I hate my clothes but question new ones, I blow out my hair but everyone asks why I never have my natural wavy curls anymore. I see other people wearing things and think, “I should dress like that,” when I used to just ignore trends and bought what I liked. \n\nIn the long run, I know all of these things are minimal and silly, but I don’t know when I’ll feel authentically like myself again. I feel like those instincts of knowing what I like and deciding to buy it are gone.\n\nI wonder if social media is partly to blame? I spend a lot of time on TikTok and Pinterest…so I see multiple diff styles a day. I’ve debated just taking a social break to dim the constant consumer voice. And also when I try to shop the excess amount of choices feels so overwhelming…which doesn’t help anything. \n\nI know everything evolves as you get older but I’m not evolving into something definite….I feel like I’m just evolving into feeling lost and like I don’t know who I am?! I don’t know how to find the new me that is clearly present but trapped inside somewhere?",
