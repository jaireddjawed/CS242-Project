From what I read there are no black dwarfs because at the moment the universe is not old enough for any to have been created.  But from what I understand, they would be very difficult to detect, and possibly only their gravity would be the only way to detect them, which sounds much like the description of dark matter.\n\nSo other than the fact that the universe is not old enough to have these in them, would they be a good candidate for dark matter?",

        "text": "tldr; is there a college major that combines civil engineering, environmental engineering, and space?\n\n\nUnfortunately I was not one of the lucky few who knew exactly what major they wanted to choose upon graduating from high school. I ended up picking Computer Science because I thought I may be interested in it, but after taking three quarters of it now I haven't found nearly as much fulfillment as I imagined I would have.\n\nA few weeks ago I found a short essay/lecture from a man who was trying to basically sum up all of the wisdom he had gathered in his life and share it with today's maturing generation. One thing he said that really stuck with me was that the goal of a person's life should be to find their passion and just keep doing whatever they were passionate about; to paraphrase, 'if you haven't found your passion yet then make the search your passion'. Feeling unsatisfied with compsci, I've spent the past few weeks trying to research other majors that may interest me and hopefully bring more satisfaction.\n\nThe first field I looked into Engineering, specifically Civic and Environmental. I found the idea of designing and manipulating the elements used to create a city/society, and projects like Open Source Ecology seem like things that I might really enjoy myself getting involved in. However, I was unsure of how it would play out because I had terrible experiences with AP/IB Physics in high school and wasn't sure how much overlap there would be.\n\nIt wasn't until today, though, that I think I found something to tie it all together: I was browsing reddit and somehow ended up on the Astronomy subreddit, watching a linked video featuring a speech by Neil deGrasse Tyson (We stopped dreaming, Part 2). When I saw the shot of Earth rising over the Moon's horizon, it coupled with the music led me to start sobbing; shoulders hunched, pain in my throat, uncontrollable sobbing.\n\nThat was the first time I considered trying to find a way to integrate space in with an interest in engineering design, and I think I might finally find a passion if there is a way to bring these fields together. So to wrap up this post, I'm looking for advice in regards to if there is some sort of college major offered that effectively mixes civil and environmental engineering with a focus on space.\n\nThanks /r/astrophysics!",

        "text": "Hey, this is a great subreddit I wanted to first say. I love physics, particularly in the context of space. lets just get to the point then right?\n\n1.) When gravitational collapse occurs, the star explodes. But the black hole is also formed upon the collapse. I'm having difficulty understanding how the black hole can remain after the release of all that energy which would seem substantial enough to eviscerate the integrity of the black hole (unless theyre really that strong). \n\nAlso, I've heard two variations for the genesis of elements higher than iron. The first is that upon collapse, atoms are fused. the amount of energy needed to achieve fusion of iron would come from the collapse. The other version, one I heard from Hawking is that it occurs upon explosion of the star - as matter is being ejected. \n\n2.) Expansion. The universe is expanding as different lines of evidence suggest. everything is red-shifted from us (is andromeda?). My confusion comes when thinking about the position and speed of every galaxy. It seems the universe is homogenous: I think about the expansion as a result of the big bang and have problems understanding how the universe can be homogenous. Why is the matter at the putative center of the universe, what I would consider the location of the big bang, moving, and why is there any at the location? Basically, why didnt all matter/energy exist as a halo moving outward from the point of the big bang?",

This might be really stupid but i thought it made sense.\n\n\n**My theory on the big-bang and the cycle of the universe.**\n\nSo, if all the spiral galaxies is orbiting super-massive black holes, how long will it take before all matter in the universe is in one or another black hole? what happens when these black holes starts pulling on and consuming each other? What happens if all the matter in the universe get's compressed together into a tiny little spec? \n\nI think that if an unfathomable amount of time passes everything in the universe will be sucked in to a black hole of some sort. And eventually these black holes will start consuming each other and at some point in time there will be no mass left in the universe for it to feed of. I theorize that it will kinda fade out and loose its hold on the matter it contains and thus the matter explodes outward and creates another universe from the old one that was consumed.\n\nI'm guessing I am wrong, i just want to put it out there.\n",

I've recently been accepted into a BSc program w/ a major in astrophysics, as well as a BEng program. I am currently torn between the two programs and struggling with a decision. \n\nWhat would you say is the current status of astronomy / astrophysics in Canada? Will there be a demand for astronomers in the years to come as the baby boomers start retiring? or does the astronomy field have enough young people in it already to mitigate the loss of the older generation? Are there any job prospects after completing an undergrad, or is grad school pretty much necessary? How competitive is it to get into grad school, as well as postdoc positions? Say I start the astrophysics program and realize it is not for me, how easy is it to transfer into engineering? If you could repeat your university career, would you have gone the same route? How did you know that astrophysics was the route for you? \n\nTalking with the Undergraduate Program Director, and reading posts on here it sounds like it is a very long path, filled with difficult choices and uncertainty. \n\nThe \"suggested\" courses to take for the astrophysics program sound so fascinating - especially the 3rd and 4th year courses. Doing labs and observations at the observatory! Man, that is cool! However the uncertainty of a future in astrophysics worries me. I would greatly appreciate any advice you guys might be able to offer me.\n\nSincere thanks",

If that universe within the black hole is in some sense created from the matter and energy that the black hole engulfs, shouldn't that inner universe be just as chemically complex as its \"parent\" universe?\n\nI realize this is way out on a speculative limb, but I'm hoping someone with knowledge in this area will humor me and help me understand a bit more about this theory.\n\nThanks!!",

But if the wormhole has a strong enough influence, it might alter properties such as the mass or size of the stars in a nonstandard way.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat if wormholes were common place? Say we have Star A and Star B, which are connected by a wormhole. When measuring the mass of Star A or Star B individually, we are actually measuring both stars together. Various configurations of wormholes would fool us into over-counting the mass of certain areas of space, perhaps sometimes by several factors.\n\nIf this were true, then concentrations of dark matter (i.e. unaccounted for gravity) might indicate concentrations of wormholes.\n\nIf the idea is silly, then I apologize. :)",
