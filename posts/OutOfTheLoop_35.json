However just as of last night i had clicked on it and it had the “season 3 coming on Saturday!” notification on top of the description. Inuyasha is such an old show and it has like what 7 or is it 8 seasons in total on top of all the movies? So why is it Netflix is just now finally adding season 3 on? Let alone still cucking everyone on all the rest of the seasons?? They do have them all on Hulu, but admittedl, i would definitely preferably want to watch on Netflix because personally i have Hulu but with ads, and Netflix has no ads. Lol.",

However, as stated even in the show, in a fourth wall break, Rick and Morty was going on a 70 episodes/7 Season contract right? Given the controversy going on with Justin Roiland, are they going to just cancel the last season of Rick and Morty? Apparently according to the article above ^^ Hulu will be continuing with Solar Opposites and Koala Man or whatever? Haven’t seen the Koala Man show myself, but they’ll be continuing on both without Justin. This article just came out today stating Hulu was completely cutting ties now. So what will happen with Rick and Morty???",

Like how? I am aware of protection orders and concept of how they typically work for DV but typically if someone is charged with something and arrested, even if court stuff is on the down low because of said protection order, like i thought legally speaking, one’s arrest records were LEGALLY public knowledge, and should be obtainable? So how is it noone was aware until now? Are there different laws in California pertaining to disclosure?",

I’m not exactly sure what the whole deal is, it seems to be a “who’s actually shitter, men or women?”. \n\nAs a woman who knows the things women have to go through, and have gone through a lot of shit in the hands of men myself, I don’t hate men. If anything, I’d say I’m more scared of men. But there seems to be a debate on every aspect of men and women’s lives these days. Usually, this is how it goes: it’s mostly about relationship standards, who should do _*insert task here*_, if a man should expect or allow his woman to do _ *insert action here*_, whether a man would date a woman who does _ *insert hobby here*_, etc, if a woman would date a guy who _*insert job here*_. And it seems that from both sides, people are trying to prove that the opposite gender sucks more and they’re the ones treated unfairly. A lot of the times things are pointlessly gendered where they shouldn’t be. Do people really care about these things and set these pointless standards? This isn’t something limited to just me, I’m noticing these discussions get more regular at my workplace/social life.\n\n(I don’t really have links to the actual debates/arguments in question, as they are generally in tiktok/Instagram and except for watching, I don’t really interact with their content, such as commenting or liking. But these videos aren’t hard to find at all)\nBelow are links to videos of a tiktoker who pretty much sums up what I’m thinking.\n\nFirst part:\nhttps://vm.tiktok.com/ZMY81JMTc/\nSecond part:\nhttps://vm.tiktok.com/ZMY81eWo8/",

        "text": "When I was a kid way back in the 1990s and 2000s, Square Soft was one of the most reliable video game publishers around, their popular games topped the charts (Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VII) and even their *un*popular games were extremely solid offerings (Vagrant Story, the SaGa games.)  Kids like me held on with bated breath to hear about the latest Square Soft project, and with good reason.  \n  \nEnix, likewise, was a solid standard, they released games like the Star Ocean series and Dragon Quest; Enix's games didn't get the same sales that Square Soft's games did, at least not in the **West,** but they were widely respected as quality products and beloved by their fans.  I don't think anybody would have accused Enix of being a slouch.  \n  \nIn 2003, on the back of financial difficulties, Square Soft and Enix merged to form ~~Squeenix~~ Square Enix, and that's the back story as I know it.  \n  \nFast forward to today and it's starting to look like Squeenix is, well, floundering:  https://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=Released_DESC&amp;term=square+enix&amp;category1=998%2C994&amp;supportedlang=english&amp;ndl=1  Many of their games aren't getting a ton of sales (at least on Steam) and the reviews for those games aren't reaching the same gold standard that Square Soft and Enix used to pride themselves on.  A handful of bad games wouldn't look bad for most other publishers, but Square Enix has a pedigree, albeit an aging one.    \n  \nSo, TL;DR: What's going on with Square Enix these days?  Am I wearing rose colored glasses about the past or are they stumbling in the present?  Did something *happen,* like a shakeup in management or a change in the industry, or am I just getting old?  Where did Square Soft and Enix go?  Is this just the new normal, or do you think there's a chance for a comeback?",
