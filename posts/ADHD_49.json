Over the past 5 years maybe longer I watch TikTok but I don't like watching movies as much. It is hard for me to get into the plot and I get bored. I struggle to get motivated to do things I should around the house and stay organized.  I just move things in my house to a different area and then I can't find anything. I am forgetful and lose my phone and spend a lot of time looking for it several times a day. I have other symptoms and relate to how other adults when they describe how it effects their behavior.",

        "text": "Hey everyone, tldr is at the bottom.\n\nI have been keeping up with the national Adderall shortage in the US and, although it didn't affect me directly, I was very concerned that it eventually would. Well, that day has come. \n\nI was diagnosed late and started taking stimulants in late 2021. I switched to Adderall XR in January 2022 and have been using it ever since. It was a life changing event making the switch. Not only did it help me see how productive I actually could be, but also improved all of the relationships in my life and allowed me to switch to a higher paying, but also highly stressful, job. This job requires so much focus and motivation to work as the workload never stops and even has been spiking lately as people flounder and quit. As someone with ADHD, you may already know where I am going with this.\n\nI have my prescriptions filled at the beginning of each month and I take them every day. I was able to skip a few days early on when work wasn't as stressful and it has allowed me to have a week's worth of doses by the time I am able to pick up my next prescription. I called my pharmacy to check to see if my prescription was sent in (my doctor does automatic scripts for three months at a time) and they had said that they can fill this month's prescription, but they cannot guarantee next month.\n\nThis has me very concerned. I will not be able to function at any level that would allow me to maintain, let alone excel, at my job and I am afraid I will fall so far behind without my medication that I will end up losing my job, my house, and everything else. I am on my second of three interviews for a new position right now, but it is a difficult job to obtain even if I were not afraid to lose my access to my medication. If I am able to get this job, I wouldn't be able to start until May. \n\nNow, I have been thinking about how I will be able to manage if I am not able to have my prescriptions filled in April. Beyond April, I have no idea what I will do.\n\nI have decided to ration my XR doses and only take them during the week. I absolutely need them on Mondays and Tuesdays as those are my heaviest days, but lately even Fridays have been tough whereas they used to be my easiest days. I could try to only take it on Monday, Tuesday, and as needed during the week with a goal to not exceed four a week. If I am able to do that, I would be able to make it through April. If not, I would run out on April 26th.\n\nI do have seven capsules left of my previous prescription of methylphenidate ER, but it is currently two months past the discard date on the bottle and I am wary about switching to a different stimulant so suddenly. \n\nI have never had coffee, so I can try to ease into that to give me some focus. I also have been taking pre-workout for an instant boost in the morning, but it doesn't last very long and it also doesn't give me the motivation I need like Adderall does. \n\nI honestly don't know what else to do. What other options do I have? I could switch medications, but I've read that all sorts of medications, not just Adderall, are having a shortage currently. What would you recommend I do?\n\ntldr; I might not be able to get my Adderall prescription next month and I am afraid I will lose my job, resulting in me losing everything else. I am going to start rationing, but that is only a temporary stopgap. I would love some advice on what to do.",

I would think about some insecurity I have and then completely obsess and find ways to resolve the issue. I also get a lot more stressed on the stimulant. I was wondering if it would be effective to take intuniv in in morning with my Vyvanse. However by doing this, would this diminish the effectiveness of Vyanse?",

I often distract myself with scrolling social media and mobile games because it doesn't require me to think! and I feel like all this causes me to struggle to communicate with people because I just don't know anything. also I do think I might possibly have ADHD but I feel like not everything I feel is that, I don't know. please respond if u have any idea what is wrong with me or if u maybe can relate, and feel free to ask questions because I know it's not the most organised piece of text.

I do not have stable effect of Concerta the whole day, and by evening around 19-21 I will begin to crave candy very intensely. \n\nI take it around 8:30, and I seem to feel effect 4-6 hours after, and then I slowly become my chaotic self, so I have IR 10 mgx2 to take. I am nowhere up to any standard of the people around me already with the first 4-6 house, but I did have a bit more daily routine than I have ever had. \n\nBut I still have a hard time sleeping. I had succes sleeping naturally (2 hours before being able to sleep) on 54 mg, but I had barely any effect of that dose. \n\nSo I have been on Seroquel 12.5/25 mg, which is also beginning to not be as efficient as before, and honestly also a very not so great feeling Seroquel will give. 6 mg melatonin also is not working. Not even together the whole mix.... \n\nMy doctor then suggested me to take 5 mg IR before nighttime to sleep on. \n\nAnyone who has been through something similar and did the IR help in any way?\n\n I am a bit worried to try it out, since I really am beginning to feel the worsening of symptoms and feeling off by getting poor sleep again. I already accepted having to wake up 2-5 times to pee every single night (no liquid I drink before bedtime), I just really wish to be able to fall asleep without using 5-8 hours to do so....",

        "text": "I’ve started doing this weird thing where I put on back catalog episodes of a podcast I like to focus. The podcast already had 100s of episodes by the time I discovered it, and they’re time sensitive so I don’t really care as much about focusing hard on the old content. For some reason they help me focus. To be more specific, it helps me focus when I’m doing things that involve typing and actually interacting with digital work (writing code, preparing presentations, etc), it definitely doesn’t help me read. If I have to read a paper or other large amount of text, I switch to music. But for the work where it helps, it feels like having the human voices in the background somehow captures the adhd part of my brain that is always saying “What about this other task? Did you put the right text on the other slide? What’s in that email? Reply to this objectively unimportant text right now!” It’s like it puts guardrails on my brain in a way that music doesn’t. Is this something anyone else does? Is this healthy or am I causing long term problems by not practicing dealing with my adhd by trying to focus without things like this?",

I know that I need help and the teachers are able to provide it but it always seems wrong. Even knowing that I do have accomodations for classes, I only use my headphones for all classes and only use the quiet room for tests for one class. I have something still in my head that I should not ask for anything more and I can accomplish my tasks with what I currently have. However, I just keep missing deadlines, needing to crunch on homework and studying, and just not understanding topics as soon as I feel I should. \n\nThe same sentiment applies to even just talking with other students. Even with close friends, I'm uneasy about asking anything from them. It's a wierd combination of thinking they will say no and thinking that I can just get it done if I focus hard enough. But, nearly every time, I can't do it. \n\nI wanted to ask people who may have had a similar experience in the past as me how to overcome this anxiety. It seems to come from a mix of a fear on what could happen or how they will view me and a want to be able to do it by myself. I know I can't letthis go any further so any advice on this would be good.",

I was the psychiatrist's first client, ever, and it was obvious during the tests because he was referring to the instruction booklet over and over which felt very unorganized. A few days after we had a chat over the phone where he gave me my results. He said I have anxiety, and general depressive symptoms but not enough evidence to support an ADHD diagnosis. I was sort of relieved to know what was wrong with me but I feel like I should get a second evaluation by someone else. My anxiety stems from school and my inability to focus, and also because I'm preparing to apply to grad school so I'm studying for an entrance exam. Everything I've read online about ADHD aligns with how I feel daily, and I've read that ADHD can be often misdiagnosed as anxiety.

With such little availability of drugs of this type in Mexico, one has to settle for something that is not the most effective in treating their condition, while in places like the United States people can find the right drug and it genuinely changes their lives for good. When is Mexico going to change its position with these drugs? What's your insight, opinion or knowledge about this topic?",

Don’t really feel comfortable elsewhere.\n\nI could write an essay about this but I’ll keep it short as possible.\n\nMy sister has ADHD, like me, but also has a couple of “quirks” I want to identify. \n\n1) She is very self-absorbed. Turns conversations toward herself always. Shares very mundane details of her life. Previously addicted to social media - putting on a perfect public persona - and also doing strange things for social clout. Quick to ask for favors but completely incurious about others.\n\n2) She talks to you/continues to talk to you at a normal conversational volume while you are in another room, across the house even. This happens every time I see her. I can’t hear her beyond a mumble. She doesn’t seem to recognize this even if you point it out.\n\n Now what really got me curious about this is that my step-mother does these exact same things. It’s uncanny. The room thing, obsessed with self-image and social clout etc. She’s just better at the social game, doesn’t go full narcissist in public, instead she manipulates people.\n\nAlso possibly relevant: they both are addicts (pills). My sister had some REALLY rough years but is recovering. Step-mom…I doubt it.\n\nI want to better understand my sister so I can help her but I have no idea what this is. Together with the ADHD, she really isn’t functional at all. She was diagnosed with BPD at some point but that doesn’t really sound right, but I might be naive.\n\nAny ideas?",

I was never formally diagnosed with ADHD, but showed enough symptoms for my doctor to comfortably give me a prescription. \n\nThe medication has helped me tremendously...when it works. I can focus, things that otherwise cause me to be completely disinterested have value, and I have enough activation energy to actually accomplish goals. \n\nHowever, after a couple days (usually 2-3) of taking it as directed, it will just stop working. The only thing I feel will be a higher heartrate and restless, but all the mental effects disappear. \n\nI thought it was dietary, due to how certain foods interact with stimulants, but that did not seem to be the case after removing acidic foods. After a few days of stopping the medication, the positive effects will return, but I'm then useless for that downtime. \n\nDoctors have been unable to give me any guidance, other than increasing the dosage, and seem genuinely bewildered at the dilemma. So far, I've tried increasing the dosage and switching to XR pills to no avail. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this? What did you do? Why does this happen? I'm at my wits' end and it is seriously affecting my quality of life.",

        "text": "I hope this makes since, my mom called my doctor to change my script, I used to take 12.5 mg of the instant release but none of the oharmacies had it, so my mom called and had it changed to the extended but she didn't know how the mg converted and it was between 10 and 30 for the extended so she chose 10.\n\nBut now im wondering, is that the same as taking 5mg twice a day? cause if it is then I don't think it will work and now im really really scared cause I don't think I would be able to get it chamged until this one runs out but if it's 5mg then it would be like taking nothing for a month which I don't think I can do please help im so scared im really close to failing a bunch of classes rn why can't i just get my normal medication 😭",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been learning a lot recently about ADHD and have been a lurker on this community for awhile. I would really appreciate any thoughts about my (and my family’s) situation.\n\nMy therapist and I have been speaking about ADHD as something I might have, and I’m considering getting a diagnosis. I’ve been a high achiever most of my life, but the pandemic has shifted my perceptions a bit as I’ve had more time alone to reflect and to come face to face with my behaviours. I took anti anxiety meds in 2021 and it exacerbated ADHD type symptoms and my motivation disappeared. I started to feel more depressed, and struggled with organization and prioritization. I realize now that my anxiety propels me to do a lot. I have other symptoms of ADHD as well, but this post isn’t about me.\n\nMy father has always exhibited classic ADHD behaviours, and as a kid I didn’t know enough to know that’s what they are - inattentiveness, not being able to watch movies or focus for long, not being able to stand doing things he wasn’t interested in, requiring extrinsic motivation like work (and he was always working!), anxiety, emotional dysregulation, disorganization, and relying on my mom for executive function. I came across his report cards as a kid and he did poorly in school as well. But he had a great memory (like myself), and was able to function well at his job. It gave him confidence and a purpose.\n\nSince he’s retired, things have been harder for him. He had a couple of TIAs and has been hospitalized a couple of times. He tried to keep working during the early parts of the pandemic, but the risk was too great with Covid and he was struggling with tasks and with focusing. Now he is directionless, and has a diagnosis of major depression with psychosis. He’s on a lot of pills and was maxed out at one point, and tried many different types of SSRIs and antipsychotics. He can barely focus these days on anything, he continues to struggle. It’s been hard for all of my fam.\n\nThis has me thinking of my own reactions with medication and potential diagnosis, and that ADHD runs in families. I tried to create a schedule for him (extrinsic motivation!) and it helped for a bit. But he’s really not doing well now. I wonder if the lack of structure and post retirement changes, plus ADHD, are the root of much of this. Could it be that he’s similar to me and anxiety was his coping strategy, and that anti-anxiety and depression meds have resulted in him feeling unmotivated and even more unfocused?\n\nIf anyone here has similar experiences themselves or with family, I would really appreciate hearing about it. Even potentially if you can relate to getting a diagnosis later in life, or know someone who’s had one post retirement. I know retirement can be a difficult transition for folks, and I expect it’s much harder on those with ADHD.\n\nThanks 🙏",

I didn’t get around to starting that process until now… However, I’m in my senior year at an Ivy League university and I’m really struggling to keep afloat and have fallen behind. So I’m looking for any tips regarding studying, procrastination (big one), focus, etc. you may have until I’m able to get professional help. Also any tips you have for holding yourself accountable? And honestly just general support cause I feel like I’m drowning but, god,  I’m supposed to be done after this semester so I really don’t want to fail any classes. \n\nAny help is really appreciated!",

I'm not gonna lie I'm freaking out because I was told have to transfer out after the fall and I don't know if the admissions of the transfer school will understand if I take the course (ENC1101) a third time.

        "text": "Hello, Ive started my first meds for ADHD recently, I've only in the last roughly 5 days started Dexedrine. For the first 3 days I was on 5 mg pills, two times a day, and today and yesterday I've gone up .5, so I take 1 and 1/2 pills in the morning and at lunch. My doctor instructed me to slowly up the dose until I notice a big difference, which I haven't yet.\n\nBut I'm worried about some side effects, mostly just my heart rate. My bpm has always been finicky, when I got a smart watch for Christmas last year I noticed when I'm lying down or sitting it's around 65-70, and when I stand up its around 115, but that's all very normal for me. What I'm concerned about is the fact that now when I lie down it's around 75-85, and when I sit up or stand up it's 110-130, and this wouldn't concern me if it weren't for the fact my usual chest pains have gotten worse and I'm having more heart flutters and feeling my heart beat fast and hard a lot more than usual. I also feel short of breath, but I get mildly short of breath frequently anyway. I don't feel especially anxious when this happens, actually since taking the pills my anxiety has practically disappeared altogether! But I am still a little worried about the side effects.\n\n I've had blood tests and of course an ECG, all of which came up perfectly fine. Is it normal that my heart should freak out a little on the new meds? Will it calm down eventually? Or is this a problem I should call my doctor about?\nThank you very much for reading!!",
