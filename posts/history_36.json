        "text": " \n\nWelcome to our Simple/Short/Silly history questions Saturday thread!\n\nThis thread is for all those history related questions that are too simple, short or a bit too silly to warrant their own post.\n\nSo, do you have a question about history and have always been afraid to ask? Well, today is your lucky day. Ask away!\n\nOf course all our regular rules and guidelines still apply and to be just that bit extra clear:\n\nQuestions need to be historical in nature. Silly does not mean that your question should be a joke. [r/history](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/) also has a discord server where you can discuss history with other enthusiasts and experts",
