I was amazed to learn that they found dna and rna evidence of meteorites and they believe this could’ve been a potential pathway to life on earth.\n\nThen I learn that 97 percent of humans contain the same elements that are found in stars.\n\nThen I learn that stars when they die and burn out they don’t just die and end their life and that’s it but return their energy to the universe and give way to the birth of new stars.  \n\nMaybe when we die, we are like stars? We return our energy to the universe. I don’t know what this feeling is called, but I’ve grown to not just appreciate the cosmos, but have grown to learn that, in a way, we are actually ingrained with the cosmos.\n\nThere is just something so beautiful about this knowledge and makes life feel more meaningful (at least from my view point) to me.",

If you think about it, time does not exist in the way we think it does. If you go near a black hole, time begins to be very weird. On other planets, time passes differently than it does on Earth. How can we correctly put an age to something that has no age? The Big Bang theory states that the universe is 14 billion years old, but in all honesty, I do not believe the big bang theory. I find it hard to believe that everything was created from a tiny little ball. It just sounds ridiculous. If the universe has always existed, that would also explain why we can't find life anywhere. Earth has only been around for 4.6 billion years, but what is 4 billion compared to trillions of years?\n\nTruth is, I do not believe we will ever understand the universe. We can come up with theories as much as we want, but we can never know because the universe is not meant to be understood.",

        "text": " First, let me say that this whole thing is just a massive \"what if\", since, as I understand it, the prevailing evidence suggests a flat universe. Then again, I've often wondered if that's just like standing on the surface of a planet, which only appears flat when you're on the ground - how can you be so sure it's flat when you need to be in orbit to see the curve clearly? \n\nBear in mind, my experience with physics and cosmology is as an amateur enthusiast, and my knowledge of trig could be better.\n\nNow, obviously one can calculate the distance to the horizon of a sphere (planet) based on height above the surface, and the radius of said sphere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqh3bj1y3dna1.jpg?width=991&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=439ff96a7c24a7398446a212e1071a28f391b9c0\n\nDistance to the horizon = a, radius = b, radius + height above the surface = c\n\na² + b² = c², so c² - b² = a²\n\nI'm assuming - though my lack of trig knowledge leaves me uncertain how - the inverse is also true, that one can calculate the size of a sphere based on height above the surface and distance to the horizon.\n\nIf it is possible, that also leaves me to wonder if one could perform a similar calculation to estimate the total size of the universe, beyond the observable horizon.\n\nMy thinking is that if you treat the three dimensional \"surface\" of the universe like the two dimensional surface of a sphere, and time, which is perpendicular/orthogonal to 3D space, like your height above said \"surface\", you could use the distance to the edge of the observable universe - which is essentially our temporal horizon - to calculate the total size of the universe in 4D space. I don't see any problems with translating these calculations to higher dimensional spheres, since it's the same calculation in two and three dimensions - unless there's some variable I'm unaware of with hyperspheres.\n\nThe tricky part to me, is deciding what units to use. The one that makes the most sense to me is using Planck length and Planck time, since they're the most fundamental units, and just treating them as though they're both the same measurements. I mean, they essentially are the same, the only difference being that Planck time is just measuring space along the w axis. \n\nGood luck to the crazy fucker who tries to calculate the exact size and duration of the observable universe in Planck units though.",

They tear normal matter to it’s true steady state (dark matter) and it’s constantly emitting dark matter, seeding the galaxy filaments \n\n3. Hawking radiation may exist, but black holes dissipate due to the radiation of dark matter more so than lucky escaped regular matter\n\n4. This has a link to the capture of photons, that like a gravity lens can bend light, a black hole can bend it and space so hard it captures the energy. \n\n5. Given the macro and micro mimic each other in display, this gives credence to black holes being like mini pre universes. The concentration being so high that when it expands, normal matter/energy (neutrons/photons exc.) appears. \n\nI am just a dude who reads too much about space. Tear my theory apart if you wish.
