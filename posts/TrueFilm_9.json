I know some people will bring up Westworld getting cancelled as a major blight against HBO (even though it was a way too expensive show for its ratings). But even after Netflix , Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, Apple +, Paramount, Peacock etc. with all these studios making an entry into the streaming space and increasing their content output, HBO still is easily the king of quality television overall with way more hits at a time than any of the other sevices.\n\nWhen you compare the trajectories of networks like Showtime, AMC, Starz etc to HBO and how all of these have faltered in the last decade while HBO still remains at the top, I just wonder how is HBO able to do that. Yes obviously it makes great shows but if every network could make great shows they would all be HBO. What is it that sets HBO apart?",

        "text": "In case you didn't know, there's a new 'Saw' film releasing this year, and it's supposed to be a sequel to the original, taking place around that time in 2004-ish. Tobin Bell is returning as 'Jigsaw' and so is the character of 'Amanda' played by the same actress. It's awesome they seem to be making a film in that psychological-thriller-mystery style...\n\nAnd although I'm incredibly curious to see what this movie ends up being like, and hope it knocks my socks clean off... with that being said, I'm equally worried that this film will be another forgettable film.   \nLet's rewind and shift franchises for a moment... year 2010, the 'Halloween' franchise. Now, Rob Zombies almost-unanimously hated film \"Halloween 2\" had just released one year ago.   \nNow, let's say within the next couple years, we hear that a brand new 'Halloween' film is releasing, and it's not going to be a continuation, but something completely new... yet the thing is, Rob Zombie is back, and so is the Weinstein production company. So we have the same writer who brought us a movie that just bombed and nobody liked, along with a production company that is heavily restrictive and creatively steers the ship, when often times they are quite clueless.  \nThat, unfortunately, is pretty much the same situation we have here with 'Saw X'. Same writer that brought us two extremely poor and weak attempts at reboots, along with the same production company that has been creatively guiding the ship ever since Saw 3, where the series' downfall really began a noticeable decline.   \nIt is true, too many people blame Josh Stolberg for how terrible Spiral and Jigsaw were, but it's not just his fault, it's also Twisted Pictures who, to be blunt, have their heads so far up in la-la-land that they can't see the forest for the trees... they're not artists...!! They don't know what's best for this franchise, they don't understand the deep complexities and beautiful simplicities that make a movie excel into the stratosphere; crucial aspects and ingredients that Saw 1 and 2 utilized brilliantly and skillfully.   \nHaving ding-a-ling Josh Stolberg and Pete Goldfinger back, having Mark Burg and Oren from Twisted PIctures... yep, I'm super worried that this film will be another let-down.   \nWho knows, maybe the studio has some secretive hidden Ace up their sleeve that we all don't know about; some brilliant writer that they brought on who had amazing ideas for 'Saw X', and that the studio is giving up way more creative control this time around...   \nThe only way for this new 'Saw' film to be a great film, is for the above changes to be made. After seeing the producers just drag this franchise through the mud for so many movies, I'm hoping they finally can recognize the necessary changes that need to be made.   \nWe don't need a rehash of Saw 1 and 2, I'm not a militant 'Saw' purist, I just want a great film. Beauty in simplicity; the best films, and best 'Saw' movies, are beautifully simplistic and full of intrigue, deep character dynamics, enriching plots.. that's where the magic is.   \nAfter being very excited for 'Jigsaw' and astronomically amped for 'Spiral', and being monumentally let down... I hope this new 'Saw' movie is a smashing success.   \nI shouldn't be excited, because history has shown that I should have expectations lower than marianas trench, but it's still my most anticipated movie this year... I'm very curious for it, despite my immense frustrations and concerns.   \nChime in! I want to see more thought-provoking posts on here, less memes and bs.",

All the action sequences were just simply incredible. I would call this the modern gun fu (the original gun fu came out of Hong Kong cinema). The production designs were also mind blowing.

        "text": "Now this question may take a little explaining on my part. As part of my historical series, I covered Tess of the Storm Country (Found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38rjAakdTC0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38rjAakdTC0) ) directed by Edwin S Porter, and found myself contrasting him as a director to Cameron with his latest release The Way of Water (Found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3fNJDaXK5I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3fNJDaXK5I) )\n\nEdwin S Porter is most well known as the director of the 1903 Great Train Robbery, a pivotal film in early cinema. However, as time went on, Porter showed less and less interest in narrative storytelling and seemed to be mostly interested in the technology behind film. As a result he started to fall behind the times when it came to modern narrative structure. His movies started to take on a stagy aesthetic with boring direction and uninteresting performances. His interest in technology alone became unsustainable for the 1910 audiences and he would eventually retire at a (relatively) young age of 45. Even his star in Tess of the Storm Country, Mary Pickford, called him out saying- “Porter can’t direct nothing. Nothing.” \n\nGoing from leading film pioneer to being grilled by critics and your star is not the best look. \n\nIs Cameron heading in the same direction? The Avatar series has been a massive success but Cameron seems far more concerned with pushing technology and less invested in giving audiences interesting characters or a sharply crafted narrative. I'm not even making an argument for that being an outright bad thing. I gave The Way of Water a positive review, as I did enjoy it more than the original. Yet there is no denying that it is the technology and visual effects that are the main star, often to the detriment of other elements. In my opinion, the story was still overly simplistic and the characters were hardily the most well rounded.\n\nI’m not exactly trying to equate the two. Cameron IS a very proficient storyteller and still knows what he is doing behind the camera. We’ve seen him make some brilliant films. But my question is more in regards to the path he is heading down. Right now the Avatar movies still make a killing at the box office (as Avatar looks to pass over 1.8 billion) but this arguably is due to people’s fascination with the new effects and immersion in an alien world. It is also worth noting that despite how Pickford savagely shredded Porter’s directing style, Tess of the Storm Country was a massive blockbuster for its time and became one of- if not THE- biggest movie of 1914 and made Pickford a worldwide star.\n\nCritiquing the Avatar franchise for its shallow writing is nothing new among film buffs. But we all know it isn’t what is putting butts into seats. When we look at how history repeats- creators who stop focusing on story in exchange for pushing technology seem to slowly lose their audience. It is the difference between someone who seeks to be a film pioneer and someone who seeks to be a great storyteller. Maybe they are two different goals? The storyteller seeks to use technology to tell a story and the pioneer uses a story as an excuse to further technology. I think Cameron is starting to fall into the latter. And for me, it begs the question if concentrating on technological advancement over story is any more sustainable in 2020 than it was in 1910.",

        "text": "Personally, I find The Incredibles to be a very amazing film and definitely among my favorite movies of all time. Though, when you read it a certain way, it does have a kind of Ay Randian feel to its narrative. \n\nThe story is pretty much about superheroes who are just simply gifted with special abilities while most of the population are normal humans. The government and the mob goes against their vigilantism and powers and regulates them to conforming as normal humans rather than use their power to bring service to society. The whole thing about not being allowed to be 'special' as the rest of society will not approve and that they must act mediocre like everyone else. The villains are consistently shown to rely on technology in order to even be a match against the superheroes. And of course, Syndrome's \"And when everyone's super, no one will be\". Syndrome is made to be written as illegitimate in his goal to give everyone powers by coming from his grudge and his jealousy for not being a super and also, such ideology is portrayed as evil as his methods, which are straight up genocide, attempted child murder and kidnapping and terrorism.\n\nBut I really love how it does express these ideas and I think it does make you empathize and believe that this is what is right in the narrative. You want for this family to just be allowed to fully express themselves for who they are and to see them as the real people and heroes that they are. And I think using comic superheroes as a symbol for that ideology is a perfect way to express this message (even if unintended). After all, in a way, you wanna be able to see the rich and powerful as being inherently deserving and born for their wealth and success and that whatever they do in their journey for self-gain should be seen as a heroic act that only benefits society. That they are the only ones that can have it and that can do the part right unlike the rest. And it doesn't feel preachy about it at all. It flows naturally and you accept it for what it is. It becomes as part of the relatable aspect about having to fight with your siblings, having to take care of the kids and hoping to maintain the marriage. If an objectivist wanted to convince me into liking their story about their ideas, this is how it should be done rather than just make into this big, tiresome statement about how the rich deserve to decide everything and every character only existing as an talking head for what you agree, disagree and what your opponent is meant to be.\n\nIt's a good movie in that way.",

        "text": "I have a list of favorite movies I maintain and have been building on for a few years. The other day I was looking at the list and noting the time periods/eras they were set in. To my surprise a heavy majority of them were either set in eras long gone and as recent as the 90s or they had a fantasy/dystopian/sci-fi setting. To clarify, this doesn't mean I exclusively have favorites from the 70s/80s/90s. But even films made today but set years before present time or set on a different world. Just as an example, recent movies that I added in that list of mine include The Last Duel, Dune, All Quiet on the Western Front &amp; Babylon. Some others not from too long ago include Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, The Revenant, Arrival, The Green Book.\n\nThat left me wondering and I came up with two possible answers. One is that eras different from our own offer escapism and it is one big reason many of us watch movies. \n\nThe other possible answer is that today's time period lacks any kind of romanticism of the past maybe. Since the digital revolution where we are spending a significant time of our life on front of screens, is the world become 'soulless'? Devoid of adventure &amp; charm and the possibility of life being unpredictable? These are things on which stories thrive on.\n\nBut then I am noticing of how some of our great filmmakers have been focusing on other eras too. Tarantino's last 4 films have been set centuries or decades into the past. With The Irishman, Wolf of Wall Street, Shutter Island &amp; Silence, Scorsese too has been keen to visit other eras. Look at James Cameron's last 3 films, set in early 20th century and then in Pandora. Ridley Scott made ALien Covenant in 2017, then All the Money in the World set in the 70s, then The Last Duel in medieval France, then House of Gucci again set in the 70s and then coming up with a Napolean movie followed by Gladiator. Nolan has made The Prestige and is again visiting the past with Oppenheimer with sci-fi and superheros in between. Wes Anderson creates worlds of his own. PTA's last 3 have been set in the 50s or 70s with TWBB set in the early 20th century.\n\nThere are tone of other examples of course.\n\nThat is not to say good storytelling cannot be done using the present time setting (call it post 2000 time). No, far from it. There are great films coming out set in the present time such as Parasite, Uncut Gems, Knives Out, La La Land, Decision to Leave etc. Plenty more.\n\nBut it does get you thinking, especially with statements where people say \"movies were better before\" that if the modern day setting (post 2000 time period) might inherently be an inferior setting to the eras of before?

Soderbergh's direction is absolutely stunning, the cinematrography of both movies is so beautiful, and hard to believe he used a digital camera (although it was a brand new one). The jungle scenes take my breath away, the shots he got are amazing. The movie is very subtle and weaves adeptly between 1960's Che shot in grainy black and white to Cuban revolution Che shot in colour. The music is perfect, used very minimalistically and comprised mainly of Cuban drums and folk songs. The fact they were able to get the old UN building for shooting is also incredible and very fortunate for them! The movie has an almost documentary feel to it, simple yet effective camera shots and the battle scenes are very realistic, especially if you have surround sound, you really feel like you are in the middle of the fighting, with bullets whizzing all around you. Benetio Del Torro is mesmerizing in the lead role and other than being about 6 inches taller than the real Che, looks incredibly similar in many parts. My only criticism is the actor playing Castro, he seems off from the footage I have scene and does not look much like him. Generally I am not too sure of the realism, most of the material was taken from Che's own diaries so is probably biased, but it seems accurate enough.\n\nPart 2 is also quite good, and shot very differently, different aspect ratio and colour palette. It is overall much more depressing and detached, which suits the subject matter considering it was Che's downfall. One thing it does change however regarding the communication devices not working. In the movie they are said to not work because they were stored in  a damp cave, when in reality they were defective when sent from Cuba.\n\nAnyway, I highly recommend these two movies, I watch them repeatedly and enjoy them every time.",

        "text": "I think all of us film-lovers have a film or a series of films as a sort of comfort film. Something we always go back to no matter what. I have many of those myself, but not many movie experiences can quite compare to the Before Trilogy: *Before Sunrise* (1995), *Before Sunset* (2004) and *Before Midnight* (2013). \n\nIt's impressive that such a trilogy of films managed to age so well, especially because time is an important aspect of these films. Romance to me is one of the hardest genres to do in a film, besides comedy. When thinking of romantic films, people will generally mention romantic comedies or big drama films, the Before trilogy is not exactly one of those two styles of films, and that is one of the reasons why it ranks so high on my favorite films list. \n\nIn *Before Sunrise* we as an audience experience what could be described as a \"realistic love fantasy\". The situation, two people falling in love after leaving a train in Germany, is the fantastical, but the execution is the realism. It's just two people walking and talking to each other for 90 minutes. But the writing and chemistry between the leads makes something as silly as falling in love in a day, seem possible. The movie ends on a hopeful note, Jesse and Celine promise to see each other again in 6 months. \n\nIn *Before Sunset*, we come back to Jesse and Celine after 9 years, now in Paris. What is so impressive about these films is that another dose of reality is added to it. The characters are now in their 30's and no longer hopeful 23 year old college students, they have regrets and personal problems. What's interesting about the 2nd film, it's only 80 minutes long, and not a second is ever wasted. From the moment we see the opening with the flashbacks, to the moment the film closes with Celine dancing and Jesse smiling, the movie does everything right. The chemistry between Julia Delpy and Ethan Hawke is somehow even stronger in this film, and they don't even kiss. Their writing voices are also very well felt in this film, and the contributions serve the film very well. \n\nIn *Before Midnight*, the reality of the characters is even more expanded. After being together for 9 years, having kids and getting to their 40's, Jesse and Celine are finally actually facing problems as a couple. This is further shown in the film, with the addition of other characters around the Greece setting, for the 1st time Jesse and Celine have interesting interactions with other people in the films. Seeing how they act as a couple in front of others and then alone really shows the intimate aspects of the pair. The fantasy of the 1st film has now somewhat faded, and the truth of their actions is left with them now. They both cheated on their respective partners to be with each other, which makes both of their own accusations of cheating have some serious weight. \n\nBut beyond the cheating accusations, which one could argue they both only brought up to hurt each other, the true problem they face is the sacrifices they had to make to be with each other. Jesse having to basically destroy his personal life and his previous relationship to be with Celine, sacrificing his important relationship with his son, and Celine having to sideline her career to take care of their kids and not being able to express herself and live as comfortably as Jesse does because he's a successful author. Both want some of that back for themselves, but both know the cost might be too much. In the end, we hopefully close on them, reconciling after their fight. \n\nIt's hard to find any other love story like this. Both characters from the beginning are so honest and true to life in ways I've never seen any other film do. Even when they fight, it doesn't feel like some big dramatic moment in a film, but a real fight between a couple. My favorite film is *Before Sunset*. I believe it has the perfect balance between the 1st and the 3rd. Though I think as I age, I'll be able to understand the 3rd one better, as hard as it is to watch.",

Ed Wood disproves the fact that “everything has an audience.” Some art is just miserable, with no redeeming qualities, and sometimes you just have to accept that, especially if you’re the auteur.

        "text": "This article contains a lot of stills. For a fully illustrated version please click here - https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/noboru-ishiguros-megazone-23/ \n\n*Megazone 23* is laser-focused on its target market. Everything about the film is carefully arranged to appeal to what I would guess is a 15-year-old boy. You have your motorcycles, robots, stylish clothes, pretty girls, and lots and lots of hair! The film is like one long shampoo ad. The hairstyles aren’t exactly something young boys could easily emulate in real life, but they are not quite as far-fetched as *Dragon Ball Z*.\n\n*Megazone 23* is so tightly pointed at what the producers thought 15-year-old boys wanted it feels like a parody. It’s a cross between *Beverly Hills 90210* and *The Matrix* with the added bonus of not-so-subtle product placements for Coca-Cola and McDonald’s.\n\n *Megazone 23* isn’t much of a movie but, it’s still pretty entertaining. Ishiguro, the director, sure loves his montages. There is the classic motorcycle chase montage with motion lines and split screens-\n\nThere’s the 80’s *Flashdance* rip-off montage with sweatbands and spandex- \n\nBut my favorite has to be the sexposition montage. How are you going to keep a bunch of 15-year-old boys engaged while you dump out a whole bunch of boring exposition? Have it play as a dialogue while the two main characters have sex. It doesn’t make any sense, but it will keep them boys glued to the screen.\n\n*Megazone 23* went through several incarnations before it finally ended up getting released straight to video. It was originally going to be an anime television series, but then there were budget cuts and other changes and it ended up being mushed together into three movies. I watched the first one and I’m happy to leave it at that. \n\nThe premise is that the Earth underwent some kind of environmental disaster, everyone got loaded onto giant spaceship-cities and the different ships started fighting each other, or something to that effect. The people on the ships are controlled by a computer and believe they are still living back on Earth. Shougo, our hero with the fabulous hair, gets a hold of a motorcycle that can turn into a robot and battles to save… I’m not sure who he is trying to save or what he is trying to accomplish, but he loves Yui who also happens to have beautiful hair. Together they make a lot one syllable exclamations of surprise, arousal, and determination like “uh,” “oh,” “eh,” and “huh.” \n\nThe movie ends on a cliffhanger, although a cliffhanger implies that the audience is left wanting to see what happens next, and that just wasn’t the case with me. I did like some of the pretty explosions though- \n\nI also liked some of the hearing impaired subtitles-\n\nI think “Conspiratorial Piano” would make a mighty fine name for a band, and “Getting To Know Each Other Music” could be the name of their first album. I guess watching *Megazone 23* wasn’t a complete waste of time. I’ll go tune up my guitar.",

        "text": "I personally really enjoyed this nice little oddity made in London. It's not among Hitchcock's best movies by any means, but still a fun time and a good mystery. \n\nThe main reason i would personally recommend this movie is probably Marlene Dietrich. She plays one of her usual villainous characters and she's just a joy to watch, she just murders this performance and i love how she managed to play with Hitchcock's black humour so effortlessly. Jane Wyman is a little blander in comparison, but i still love the whole concept where she has to give several different performances to investigate. The rest of the cast is excellent, filled to the brim with British character actors mostly versed in comedy, and they all do an amazing job.\n\nHere Hitchcock also tried to subvert expectations by having the killer (played by Richard Todd) explaining his perspective on what happened in the beginning of the movie through a flashback so that the audience would believe that he was innocent until the end , since at that time flashbacks where mostly used to explain events exactly as they happened. Both audience and critics unfortunately didn't appreciate it and the movie was panned (he would be more successful in subverting expectations in the legendary \"Psycho\"). In a sense i do agree that it was a little sloppily made (Kurosawa subverted the whole flashback conceit in way that was absolutely more memorable that same year with \"Rashomon\"), but that still doesn't change the fact that the last 5 minutes of the movie where they reveal the killer are easily the best part of it with its excellent use of shadows, the way Wyman's and Todd's eyes are lit is simply astounding.\n\nHave you seen tis movie? Did you enjoy it? Share a comment, i would love to hear your opinions!",

        "text": "I must admit my misfortune on not having made proper acquaintance with Director Cassavetes until recently. The domain of his influence upon independent cinema and New Wave Hollywood filmmaking was well acknowledged. It was long overdue for me to watch a film, much less a Cassavetes' film. In recent days, I managed to finish this one. \n\nOf few things I ever knew capable of breaking me from inside so strongly reverberating all over my senses, this work achieved that. In its overall production, this film is simplistic enough. The camerawork is not fancy, neither is the set design nor the editing. It seems plain enough. Except, this is one of the most complex works of art in its success (or the attempt) to capture the naturalism of life.\n\nWe have on our screen a woman whose demeanor evades labelling. The man who is her husband is another working-class man bound by his limitations of understanding, but however makes up for it in his almost infinite capacity for love/passion. There are the three children borne in a house of rabble, trip wired caution, and little stability except that of an unpredictable mother and a frustrated father. \n\nMabel and Nick Longhetti are their names. Despite its seeming simplicity, the visual style of the film is appealing with the shots of quarry, camera position remaining at chest or knee level. It almost makes one a live viewer in the personal lives of the characters and creates a certain intimacy which also ensures a no escape from the discomfort that ensues. Dir. Cassavetes' work with the actors and acting methodology is no short of highest excellence and did form the basis for later independent films and their director's methods. The music which comes in and out is like a coherent noise inside the mind of a mad person. The Swan Lake scene where Mabel asks the children to imitate the dying swan to their father is one notable point.\n\nThe film almost falls into a dramatic structure with 4 or 5 acts with some interludes in between. Each Act is drawn out to its maximum intensity. In the initial dinner scene with Nick and his co-workers, the viewer remains a nervous wreck. There is no hope for warmth despite the warm characters and their so contributions. We see Italians singing and eating with their African American mate singing their song with more fervor and better talent. For those who have been in households or relationship where one had to walk on their toes worried that just one small mistake and every semblance of peace and quiet would make an exit would see themselves feeling the same nerve again. \n\nI must admit that I simply could not believe the acting talent of Gena Rowlands. Or the fact that the main character in this film was the same person who played the older protagonist in The Notebook, or the fact that John Cassavetes' son Nick directed it (not a happy discovery). The one of the key aspects of the character was that it was not subject to terminology or blanket phrases common for the post-modernist era. We may call someone bipolar, and it presents to us a boundary of the expected behavior. Same goes for the other terms. However, Mabel falls outside most of it. This is also somehow seen in the opening dialogue by the husband to his friends, \"Mabel's not crazy. She's unusual. She's not crazy, so don't say she's crazy. This woman cooks, sews, makes the bed, washes the bathroom. What the hell is crazy about that? I don't understand what she's doing. I admit that.\" \n\nPeter Falk plays the husband Nick Longhetti. He is no less marvelous and displays with an unusual clarity the confusion, frustration, anger, and active repentance of a man who is stifled by his limitations and sustained by his love for the woman that is his wife. He loves her, or the memory of her. Wanting his Mabel back, he has to send her to be institutionalized after she lets a riot in home with their and neighbor's kids running wild including their girl child without any cloth in the living room in presence of a foreign male (although, the parent of the other kids). On Mabel's day of return from institution, he sees a hollowed version of his wife and can't hold but expel more frustration by telling her to be herself. \n\nThe only other director I saw capable of producing such theatric excellence from his actors was Sidney Lumet. 12 Angry Men and Dog Day Afternoon remain testament to that. Cassavetes' redefined that for me.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/106jpp6/a_5_star_review_of_andy_warhols_chelsea_girls_1966/",
        "text": "I'm taking some advice from u/junglespycamp and trying to get better at writing positive reviews (it's so much easier to write negative ones, I think), and I figure I'd start by going back to one of the first films I ever fell head over heels in love with, Andy Warhol's [Chelsea Girls](https://letterboxd.com/maldoror93/film/chelsea-girls/):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat makes *Chelsea Girls* a masterpiece is also what distinguishes it from works like *Blood For Dracula*. This is *in no way* a camp film; it is an anti-camp movie. Every actor is \"camp\", yes, but what's wonderful is the way that their performances are inverted by the film itself, the way they are played against themselves. It belongs to that other, dissonant, deranged style (Sontag specifically distinguishes the two in her essay), a richer, more engaging, and simply more delightful category.\n\nCompare it to *Portrait of Jason*, which is somewhat similar. In that one, a profoundly performative, self-aggrandizing, and generally irritating camp character is entertained, seemingly on his own terms, for much too long. Only at the very end does the experience finally pay off as he's broken down, his persona shattered, and he's suddenly forced to the surface of his skin. This is *that,* but without the long wait; the whole movie is the payoff.\n\nEvery actor is performing, but the film presses down on them, teasing out the violent desperation hidden behind each affectation, the radical instability. Godard claimed that every film is a documentary; this is perhaps the real premise of *Chelsea Girls*. The camera prompts a reaction, and we are privy to the whole event, not framed naturalistically as in many more boring films, but holistically *qua* the reaction to a camera. There's no suspension of disbelief, no abstraction or compartmentalization, no narrative bullshit, just a bona fide experiment that rips away any illusions and confronts us with a raw, convulsive beauty.\n\nCompositionally, too, it excels, with Morrissey and Warhol seemingly working on their feet to find the perfect angles. The sound choices (specifically, switching between the two scenes showing at any time) add a layer of unpredictability and keep us on our toes even while we are generally allowed some freedom in what we choose to focus on (and space, as well, for introspection). In short, it's perfect.\n\nThe obvious reference point for the unsynchronized split screen is the \"objective chance\" of the surrealists. And yes, Lautréamont's dissecting table is as present as the umbrella and sewing machine. The end product is something more real than real, certainly more true, and utterly fantastic. The shifts in coloration are delightful, as they generally are in any film (witness *Daisies*). So far as I can see, this is the greatest thing Warhol ever did; without a doubt, it's a masterpiece. The rest of his oeuvre fits comfortably in the \"postmodern\" camp, but this is too interesting, too honest, and too ambitious; it recalls the best of the *modernists.*\n\nAs Makavejev has it, and he's no doubt correct, narrative structure is a prison and a lie. Such readymade forms domesticate films and diminish their effect as well as our ability to fully engage with them; they stultify and kill. *Chelsea Girls* is a totally liberated film, answering only to itself, obeying its own dictates, its own logic. It is a marvelous piece of work, one of the great masterworks of the twentieth century.\n\nIf *8 1/2* had treated Mastroianni this way, then it might be a tolerable film; instead, he's allowed to bore us much too long with his affected aloofness and virtual nonexistence, his hiding deep within himself and never attaining to actuality. I'm not so sure, but I think *Southland Tales* might do something similar to what Warhol does here: it is often difficult to distinguish Dwayne the Rock's genuine discomfort and confusion from his character's, but there's no doubt that he's bewildered and pressed to his limit throughout the film, which is one of the great pleasures it offers. What Greaves does to his crew in *Symbiopsychotaxiplasm* is also very similar to what Warhol does to his cast.\n\nIt could be said that the movie treats its cast as objects, eliminating their agency as it bears down on them and manipulates them. A possible retort is that all Warhol really *does* is disclose this very lack of agency, exposing the pathological nature of the performance, returning it to its context and exhibiting its sublime truth. In any case, such concerns diminish neither the experience nor the creativity and experimental value.\n\nIf you want to watch incredible movies where women retain their agency (even more agency than they are often allowed in our society), then I recommend *Daisies* and *Celine and Julie Go Boating—*one is woman-directed, and the other makes its lead actresses artistic collaborators. Certainly, nothing here is meant to imply that this is the *only* way to make a movie, that all movies should be like *Chelsea Girls*. On the other hand, I do think that *no movie* should be like *The Godfather*, etc., conventional, drab narratives based in suspension of disbelief with characters that bore us and prosaic situations that provide little if any enjoyment.\n\nJacques Rivette once said that a film should be, if not an ordeal, then at least an experience. *Chelsea Girls*, thank god, is both.",

She looks up the name of the publisher, Roaring Wind Press, and sees that they are supposedly located at a business building about an hour away from her, which was disowned because it was flooded. After she finishes her homework, Zoe rides her bike all the way to the building, taking the anthology with her.\n\n&gt; The building’s door is locked, but Zoe is able to climb in through a window. After she enters it, she looks around and sees various strange objects: dozens of colorful masks scattered about, buckets full of an unidentifiable, foul-smelling pink liquid, a sculpture of a headless eagle, a grandfather clock that had apparently been set on fire, and a huge hand-drawn map of some surrealistic region. Eventually, at the very end of the building, she finds a large glassy material with a vision of a small farm on the other side, with plants and animals. Finding that she can stick her hand through it, she walks into its tiny unreality. *This other realm is in animation; whenever Zoe is in it, she becomes animated in animated environments.*\n\n&gt; The farm is surrounded by endlessly high walls of an unidentifiable material. There is a small house at the center of the farm. Zoe starts to look around, but suddenly, a telepathic voice (represented through silent subtitles) says it can send “them” down “the road of the anthology” so they can reach the anthologist. Zoe questions what this means. Having heard Zoe, out of the house comes a girl, who says her name is Ellery. Ellery says that she is not surprised to see Zoe, as she is used to mysterious visitors, but she doesn’t know anything about the telepathic communicator. Ellery asks the telepathic communicator, and Zoe, whether they know why Ellery suddenly woke up here 10 months ago; neither knows. Zoe tries to bring Ellery through the gateway back to the real world (which is invisible to Ellery), but while Zoe can traverse back and forth, Ellery, for some reason, physically can’t escape. The telepathic communicator says that journeying through the anthology will lead them to the anthologist, who can surely free Ellery. After some thought, they say yes. The telepathic communicator acknowledges, and says goodbye. Suddenly, the walls around Ellery’s farm collapse, revealing a gorgeous, endless landscape of stitched-together scenes from poems. Zoe and Ellery agree to begin their journey in a few days, on the first day of Zoe’s summer vacation. Zoe asks Ellery if she’ll be her friend, and if they can be friends in real life after Ellery is free. Ellery enthusiastically says yes. Zoe heads home.",

        "text": "\\*\\*\\*Spoilers ahead\\*\\*\\*\n\nThere's a quote that \"most men lead lives of quiet desperation\".  Aftersun captured this, masterfully and beautifully.\n\nI  have read many reviews but I feel not many touched upon this aspect.  The movie, imo, conveyed very well the shame, low self-esteem and invisibility of low-status men.\n\nIt is so well-timed with things like squid games, andrew tate and jordan  Peterson hitting the zeitgeist. Many men are struggling with not being able to fulfill the role of provider and a heartbreaking moment is when the daughter says don't talk about things you can't afford when the dad offers singing lessons.\n\nfrom the very start of the film, we see the effect of being broke, the hotel is a  building site, a bed is missing, and other kids have special VIP  wristbands, etc, etc.\n\nThese effects are rarely mentioned outright (apart from the signing lessons scene and losing the swimming goggles) but they are always felt. And rightly or wrongly most men internalize this as their fault and that is an extremely tough mental space to be in that can be hard to escape.  Many relationships end in divorce due to money issues, unfortunately.\n\nit's a deep shame that the father thinks his failure is so deep he shouldn't be around anymore. Those beautiful memories were had despite not being in the lap of luxury and some because of that. It's a shame he could barely afford even that holiday too. I know it plays on his mind throughout the film.\n\nAnother aspect of men's health is loneliness, for example, the scenes talking about not fitting in in your hometown, and not having birthdays  celebrated. It's well-known men make friends less and there's a class issue around birthdays that does seem to play on the mind towards low self-esteem.\n\nDepression can start early for people with poor starts in life. You can see how deeply he laments his lost potential when he tells his daughter \"you can be anyone you want to be, you can live anywhere you want to' in a society with declining social mobility these words can ring hollow. He is glad she does not have the poor/lonely start (and ultimately end) he did.\n\nFinally,  I just want to say the deepest melancholy comes from acknowledging that many men who come to their 30s without much to show for it financially have not many places to turn. There's a feeling many men have that sharing their feelings of inadequacy makes it worse, or rather just confirms it for everyone else. the best scene to describe this is when the daughter asks about the cafe he planned to open, now gone, a crushing defeat, but he shrugs it off as if he hadn't thought twice about it. Men often don't want to put their perceived failures in front of the people they love. So they bottle it up. leading lives of quiet desperation.",

With Tron, Jurassic Park, Terminator 2 and Avatar all being movies that really expanded the use of digital effects in movies and pushed them forward. \n\nIf anyone also has any movie references they noticed before the ending I would be interested as well. To me it felt like the Tobey Maguire sequence was heavily influenced by Irreversible. The red lighting, name (LA's Asshole and the Rectum), and the decent as well as murder felt very familiar.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1050dwv/five_reviews/",
        "text": "My hope in posting these reviews together is that collectively they will form a general statement on the condition of the world of cinema and of the cineaste community, as well as on aesthetics and on the merits of these five films in particular. My views are frequently unpopular, but I hope that by working (and reworking) them out, gradually hammering out a coherent philosophy of film, I will eventually formulate my ideas in a manner that is persuasive or at least palatable. Whether that process will ever end or will end satisfactorily remains to be seen. \n\nI’m including three negative reviews (The Green Ray, The Godfather, and The Passion of Joan of Arc), as well as two positive ones (Querelle and Southland Tales). It is always easier to write about a film I dislike than to explain what I like about one, but I’d like to get better at leaving positive reviews for movies that mean a lot to me. [Here](https://letterboxd.com/maldoror93/films/by/entry-rating/) you can see the full ranking of films I’ve seen, very few of which I’ve managed to review so far—many, I’ll have to rewatch before writing up. Nonetheless, I stand by the ranking as it presently exists which forms a kind of companion piece for the following.\n\n**The Green Ray (Rohmer)**: 2 stars\n\nThis movie would've improved dramatically if, in Godardian fashion, Delphine got abducted by cannibals or blown up or killed in an automobile accident. She is simply insufferable in every way, which would be fine if the film itself weren't so absurdly sympathetic to her. Do yourself a favor and watch *Celine and Julie Go Boating* instead. That movie is a masterpiece; this one is a steaming pile of dogshit with absolutely nothing to redeem it. It is boring, empty, and bourgeois as all hell, soulless, ugly, new agey, and full of crap. When people like Delphine exist in the real world, it is a sad fact. When directors create and idealize them, it's a crime.\n\nIn many ways, it reminds me of Fellini's *8 1/2*: both are movies about irritating bourgeois types being generally unpleasant with nothing I can find to enjoy or appreciate (Cassavetes's Husbands perhaps also belongs to this category, although it is more brazen about its protagonists' unlikability). Movies that are overly focused on prompting empathy are usually boring to begin with, and I typically expect more from the new wave. And then some characters in \"empathic\" movies simply don't deserve or inspire empathy because they are utterly repulsive. I think part of the problem is that many filmmakers and film enthusiasts are too much like Guido and Delphine and that this is the source of their enjoyment, a basic identification. The problem is that many people who like movies initially turn to cinema as compensation for their impoverished personalities or from a desire for validation; in short, we ought to find ways to make art films and avant-garde movies accessible to a better class of people and to leave these half-existent, sentimental, bourgeois and middle class bores behind (or else to inspire them to change).\n\nEvery day of my life, I interact with dozens of men and women with more vitality, more life, more personality and force and, yes, more existence than the cadavers being dragged around in these movies, real people in the real world. And there is no innate inability for these people to enjoy difficult movies, non narrative or surrealist cinema or whatever. How much better off we'd all be if we could bridge that gap and quit equating \"art films\" with \"movies for wilted lilies with their heads lodged firmly up their asses\"—sadly the hipster \"indie\" movement of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has only continued the trend set here. If my comments strike the reader as elitist, then I can only retort that this elevation of bourgeois neurosis and pathological sensitivity, of efette disengagement and spectral insubstantiality is a far more pernicious, stagnating elitism, an aristocratic cult—not to mention the sexist overtones in a movie like this one. \n\nMore people—regular and particularly blue collar people, not just middle class hipsters, academics, grown up \"gifted children\", and the like—need to be introduced to truly great movies like *Celine and Julie*, like *Daisies*, like *Symbiopsychotaxiplasm*, *The Forbidden Room*, *Southland Tales*, *Querelle*, like *Un Chien Andalou*. This will undoubtedly affect dialectically the types and the quality of art movies being made. We'll see new developments in film, we'll see shifts in the dominant sensibilities, logics, ideas, and so on. And garbage like this will be, if not gone (I'm certainly not proposing any sort of censorship of art I dislike), then at least no more than a drop of water in an ocean of possibilities. People will also change, and maybe some of these sensitive souls will find something to latch onto in order to pull themselves out of their rut, much as the best of the middle class will eventually line up behind the organized, class conscious proletariat.\n\n**The Godfather (Coppola)**: 2 stars\n\nThis movie has all the atmosphere of an insurance office on a Monday afternoon. Oppressively austere, buttoned up to the chin, and far too self serious, it will make three hours on the couch feel like a twelve hour shift. One of the worst I've seen.\n\nMichael is just exhausting to watch. I don't want to get into an argument about whether characters have to be \"likeable\", which is an ambiguous term, for a movie to be good. I'll say that Hawks's/Paul Muni's Scarface character is reprehensible, but his playful charisma and the intrigue of his incestuous desires make him a joy to have on the screen. Similarly, Rob Zombie's Fireflies are evil incarnate, but their chaotic energy is too much fun not to love. To describe Michael would again require recourse to the world of business; he is depicted essentially as a white collar criminal, as an empty suit, with a robotic and simply uninteresting demeanor.\n\nAnd that's a problem. This kind of narrative arc depends on the feeling that there is something to be lost or to gain, something at stake. When every character is depicted as one of Eliot's hollow men filled with straw, exactly as empty and inhuman at the beginning as at the end of the movie, without the implication that anything substantial might change, then it is difficult to escape the feeling that *nothing happened*. Formally and stylistically, nothing very interesting happens either—theres none of the dreamy psychedelia of Apocalypse Now, just the blandest Hollywood \"realism\" in the service of the blandest bourgeois \"saga\".\n\nI think it's Truffaut who once said there's no such thing as an anti-war movie. If The Godfather has one merit, it's that it proves the quote wrong. It doesn't make the mob look fun or interesting; there's nothing fun, interesting or worthwhile about the movie in general. I'm writing this review in the lunch room at my job. It's 5:30am, I've been working since 10pm, and it's been a particularly egregious night as far as equipment malfunctions and messes go. But to put things into perspective, I'd rather be here right now than sitting through this film.\n\nI guess there are maybe 3 basic themes to mention: (1) the decay of capitalism from its free, competitive stage (presented by Pt. II in inexplicably heroic, kitschy terms) to monopoly capital and imperialism; (2) the parallels and interconnections between the official above-ground world of politics, law and business and the underground criminal world; (3) some unbelievable bullshit about bourgeois families and filial piety. None of it is worth sitting through this trash for. So much of it is just watching these morons shoot each other or have business meetings in these terribly ugly, oversized rooms. It is *essentially* the tragedy of the bourgeoisie (the decline of capitalism) *from the perspective of that same bourgeoisie*, blown up to dramatic heights so far as that is possible given that we are dealing here with the minutiae of running a business and of capitalist competition…. and it’s exactly as boring as that sounds.\n\nAl Pacino is ugly, annoying, and somehow comes across as so much older than he is here, like a grumpy old businessman you'd sit across from on the LIRR and who should just be left alone to die. These movies are duds, plain and simple. It should be called the Grandfather, both because everybody in it somehow comes across like a miserable grandpa, and because it's the sort of movie you get stuck watching as a kid when your grandpa won't let you change the channel.\n\nI could not care less which characters die and which don't. I could not care less which family wins whatever stupid game they're all playing. The Cuba scenes are interesting in themselves, but it's a pretty thin reward for nearly 6 and a half hours of the rest of this bullshit. After the first few minutes, I really wish they all got killed in some kind of explosion and we could be done with it all. But it just keeps going.... I will simply never understand how much praise this shitty movie gets.\n\n**The Passion of Joan of Arc (Dreyer)**: 2.5 stars\n\nBetween 1895 and 1930, a number of engaging and interesting films were produced, including *An Andalusian Dog, Entr'acte, L'Âge d'Or, Earth, Every Day, Ghosts Before Breakfast, Man With A Movie Camera, Battleship Potemkin, Häxan, The Mysteries of the Chateau of Dice, Dr. Mabuse the Gambler, and The Starfish*. When I suggest that *The Passion of Joan of Arc* is not included among them, I hope that the other items on the list dissuade anybody from suggesting that I just can't appreciate old movies or arthouse films or whatever. \n\nEverything about this movie is heavy-handed, sentimental, and stupid. The music in the version I saw (on Criterion Channel) is overbearing and would only be appropriate with a heavy dose of irony (conspicuously missing here). The faces Ms. Falconetti makes are obnoxious and irritating. The choice to exclude everything leading up to the trial cuts the figure of Joan from an intriguing warrior who defied gender expectations and relentlessly pursued her truth to that ridiculous, apparently constipated face that is always puffing its eyes out.\n\nWhat it sets out to do is already boring enough. It has no humor, no insanity, no distance, no real ambition except to manipulate the audience's emotions with the most garish sensibility—surely, this must count as a work of camp. This aptly named Passion reminds me way too much of the masses I had to attend as a child and of the various plays that would be put on by the congregation. You can practically smell the censer, artfully designed to bring tears to one's eyes and to produce the illusion of genuine transcendence.\n\nApparently, Bresson accused the film of \"grotesque buffoonery\". In the right movie, a grotesque buffoonery is perfectly interesting; this one, however, is assuredly a miss. I will have to watch Bresson's own Trial film. Often, I find the kind of emptiness to which Bresson aspires to be less than desirable, but it surely beats the hell out of this bloated, maudlin, embarrassing mess. The whole thing is so vile.\n\n**Querelle (Fassbinder)**: 5 stars\n\nI think it's a flawless film, which is odd because I'm usually not a huge fan of Fassbinder. It's the rawest, most honest expression, maybe, of the gay male psyche. Awash in beautiful colors, with fantastic, phallic architecture, it leaves all that boring realism, historicity, narrative arc and naturalistic acting behind. Basically, all the stupid crap that bogs down so many movies is carved right out, exactly as it should be—not that it comes across as pretentious or inaccessible! I'd call it candy, except that I don't like the implications about its nutritional value and capacity to fulfill. And while it wears its artifice on its sleeve, it's hard to see what would be gained by calling it \"camp\" (which is a term of abuse, as I see it). It's viscerally, immediately erotic, literally turning you on, but its brutal honesty, the complete faithfulness with which the inspired idea was translated into reality, gives it a kind of depth as well. It's perfectly surreal; it's sexy, but it's also curious, eloquent, rich and dense. \n\nGot the movie for my parents for Christmas, so I've been revisiting it. The only other Fassbinder that I think comes kind of close is Love Is Colder Than Death, but then it's like he totally lost it. Maria Braun is ok, Fox and His Friends was not bad, but I couldn't even make it half an hour into Petra von Kant before giving up (one of a very small number of movies I've done that with, along with De Palma's Scarface which was equally boring). Apparently it took until his last film for him to remember how to make a movie, but man, he sure did. Very few films are comparable; it occupies the highest tier.\n\nIt was, incidentally, an oddly Oedipal experience for me, with Brad Davis reminding me very much of my biological father—a man I've met only once since I was a toddler and who was himself a thief like Genet and a bit violent like Querelle (besides looking more or less the part in my hazy, continually reconstructed memory). Lysiane had me considering my own relationship with women, the space they are allowed in my fantasy world (or the lack of any space for woman/women). It's difficult to imagine how a straight person (even a woman? I'm not sure) would respond to it, but I'd be curious to know. What would be a comparable \"straight\" film, one that so perfectly captures the basic sensibility of \"being a straight [man or woman]\"? And how would I respond to that?\n\nThe timelessness and eternal twilight recall the \"supreme point\" of the surrealists and the primary processes of Freud, while the ending seemingly closes the circle on this sphere, at once compartmentalizing the film as a work of art distinct from waking life and yet simtaneously containing it within the latter (as well as, more ambiguously, within Robert's and Lysiane's lives). It serves as material for analysis, if you like, as a cautionary tale, as a visual treat, and as straightforwardly erotic. Perhaps it will draw attention to aspects of the viewer's own psyche as it did in my case. It is and does all these things at once in an organic unity.\n\nGenet once claimed that if his writing turned anybody on then he had failed in his mission to provide a purely aesthetic experience. Fassbinder may not have gotten the message, or maybe he disregarded it. Then again, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly has always turned me on, so maybe the trouble is with me. I hate to reduce films like these to the category of \"pornography\", as I think there's a great deal more going on here and that it's far more artistically valuable than anything on pornhub.com, but there's an undeniable eroticism in both movies which is necessary to mention because it basically defines the experience of watching them.\n\nQuerelle is depicted as a messianic figure, religion and eroticism melding in an uninhibited exploration of a particular fantasy logic, a distinct mode of worshipful sadomasochistic homoeroticism. This is certainly what one finds often enough in Genet himself, and Fassbinder is actually one of the most faithful Genet adaptors in terms of mood, logic, and sensibility, even while he makes the material his own in some ways. The dialogue is wonderful, generally surrealistic sequences that are easy enough to grasp on at least some level and that express, among other things, the experience of a gay man coming to terms with his sexuality and a sexually tense relationship with his brother, but that never feel too prosaic or conventional. It is always deeply poetic, psychologically expressive, uncanny and bewildering. Again, as it should be.\n\n**Southland Tales (Kelly)**: 5 stars\n\nI keep coming back to this movie; I can't stop thinking about it. I last saw it a week ago. I'm going to try and make my sister watch it with me when she visits for Thanksgiving. This can in no way be my final review of the movie—it's just where I'm at now. \n\nA lot of people seem to take issue with Timberlake's/Abilene's narration, because it violates the \"show don't tell\" rule. I think they've totally missed what's going on here. Throughout the film, we are being fed information from various sources, which we are then forced to assimilate and integrate mentally. Yes, it is a very demanding movie. I think that's one of its strengths. The overstimulation is part of the movie's charm. People rightly point to Philip K. Dick as an influence, but the particular way in which the viewer is forced to grope his or her way out of a condition of blind immanence and gradually come to some sort of understanding really recalls Pynchon in my opinion.\n\nIt is decidedly not a straightforward narrative, action film. Instead, we get a series of disjointed tableaux as well as computer screens, USIDent camera footage, news interfaces complete with tickers displaying jumbled up letters, second hand accounts of action we just observed ourselves, vague premonitions, and so on and so forth. The messiness of it all, along with the casting and direction, make the whole movie a kind of surrealistic-Brechtian extravaganza (and are there any two more beautiful words in the world of cinema than \"surrealist\" and \"Brechtian\"?—move over, \"cellar door\"). \n\nThe movie grapples with a clusterfuck of intersecting issues that range from capitalism, alienation and ecological destruction to sexual repression and repressive desublimation, with some ontology thrown in for good measure. It is a clusterfuck because our world is a clusterfuck. Ultimately, I find the way it threads these themes together to be rather compelling if not exactly cogent. For example, rather than deliver a simple answer, such as Krysta Now gives, the movie forces us to understand the concrete, dialectical totality of the situation in which the pornographer is the obverse of the puritan. But that is so much more honest and, you know, just so much more interesting and engaging than what we are normally spoonfed by Hollywood.\n\nThe two most powerful moments of the film are, without a doubt, the Killers lip sync and the movie's close. Both are concerned with Taverner's reconciliation with himself. The telepathic hallucination, I take it, is Abilene imploring Taverner to forgive himself, a buddy's way of saying \"no hard feelings\". Kelly referred to it as the heart of the film, and it is also just delightfully fun.\n\nThe end gives us two great images: the dancing trio aboard the Westphalen and the ascending truck with the Taverners holding hands inside as Kefauver launches the bazooka from the top and finally dives to the ground. Something about Kefauver's baggy clothes billowing in the night as he stands atop an ice cream truck with a newfound determination and strength of character is so strangely, perhaps convulsively, beautiful. I would go so far as to call it haunting. \n\nThe repetition of \"friendly fire\" and \"I forgive you\" is sincerely moving. It is one of the few moments in the film that come across as simply heartfelt and almost narratologically conventional (despite the bizarre circumstances), but the fact that we have been misdirected the whole time into mistaking Boxer Santeros for the messianic protagonist enhances the resolution's beauty while simultaneously drawing our attention to the movie's artificiality, the conventions of narrative form, etc.\n\nThis is, in all seriousness, one of the greatest movies ever made. It is not \"so bad it's good\" or anything like that. It is just a really friggin good movie that the Cannes crowd was apparently not ready for. I have no doubt that Roger Ebert would hate it as much as he hated Freddy Got Fingered. But right now, Ebert is somewhere deep in the labyrinth from Hellraiser 2 complaining that his afterlife lacks a traditional plot. We deserve more movies like this and fewer movies made for the Eberts of the world. I want to live in a world where the Godfather is recognized to be a giant turd while this movie is celebrated and shown to everybody.\n\nPart of me is pretty sure that the floating ice cream truck and rocket launcher actually equate the revolution (and the apocalypse?) with sexual excitement and orgasm. It is difficult not to read the theme of alienation as prominent, and something of Krysta's (vulgar/quasi-)Reichian worldview is vindicated, even if she herself is presented as naïve, superficial, and trendy. To be clear, I certainly don't think that its surface-level depiction of \"Marxism\" is where to look for its actual engagement or intersection with Marxist themes and ideas.",

        "text": "While a lot of people seem to be pretty much aware about how the film has been criticized for it's depiction of a trans character, I think not many people talk about how the feminist themes of the film also connect to the transphobia of the film and makes a prediction to a ideology that has become very popular lately such as with JK Rowling.\n\nIf there is a story to the film besides the investigation of serial killers, it also tells a story about how men perceive and treat women through a female FBI Trainee and her work hunting a serial killer (Buffalo Bill) along with her male comrades. And the other women who have their bodies literally objectified by a person who sees themselves as a woman while having been born male.\n\nThe fact that she is a newbie to this environment that she is does add to the uncomfortable nature of how she is treated in her work. A lot of interactions with her coworkers are them complimenting for her looks, expressing their attraction for her and just looking down on her. Male cops are shown to be just staring at her because well, she is a new and a woman. Possibly thinking about how tough this job must be for this young woman here. Or how she should probably not be here as their size on screen along with her overwhelms her. You also have the men in the cells screaming in excitement like wild animals as they see this woman passing by and even one of them masturbates around her and throws his semen on her, just to make the point how she is perceived more blunt than it already was\n\nAnd of course, we have Buffalo Bill, a man (or at least that's how the narrative presents them as) who murders and takes the skin of cis women so they can then wear them.  \n\nEven Lecter, a man of extreme politeness and sophistication despite his monstrosity, is not totally free from these perverted male indulgences as he puts strong emphasis in the US Senator's motherly use of her body to sexualize and mix it with the disgusting acts of the killer.\n\nThe film, in a way, is telling that we live in a world with men who are pigs and where women are not safe from their gazes and physical acts. Women are to be seen, talked and touched as objects of desires. Other traits about themselves either become secondary or irrelevant to those desires. When they are looked down on and are all novices. Both to the threat of violence and to a challenge and are only helpless to be novices to the man born veterans.\n\nBuffalo Bill, out of all the men, is the logical conclusion to these patriarchal instincts: women as property. As a way of sending a man to a higher plane of existence with their bodies. Their admiration with the women he skins are not about the respect for the concept of womanhood but of a perversion of it. A sexual desire to destroy the womanhood to only belong to him and him only. Buffalo Bill tells us that not even women own their bodies nor what makes them women. Only the man does.\n\nAnd ultimately, womanhood and the female sex triumphs. Clarice refuses to be taken by the darkness around her, to be mocked and to be weak and defeats the physical embodiment of male gaze by shooting him in the face. Buffalo Bill dying while stalking Clarice in their night-vision goggles is a way of saying: \"You have no longer have the right to look at my body without my consent.\" He dies exposing his nature of looking at his prey. \n\nTrans-exclusionary radical feminism (AKA TERF) is a ideology that not just thinks that some men are predators around women but that even the men who pretend to distance themselves from these toxic ideas about maleness cannot escape those biological urges. All men are all potential or convicted rapists and objectifiers and women must do whatever they can to defend themselves from that. It also sees trans women as men who have perverted their womanhood and expressing their fetish of walking over it for their own disgusting needs. The man is biologically always dominant and is naturally desires dominance and sex and the woman is biologically much more vulnerable to their power. They are, like reactionaries love to say, man-haters. Man-haters who borrow the language of feminism and gender equality that not only creates inequality between men and women but also women  and women. It essentializes women as all inherently potential victims of sexual violence and as being their private parts and that whatever trauma a man may have caused them must mean it is the responsibility of everyone who wasn't born with a uterus. \n\nTrans exclusionary radical feminism is not feminism but justified misandry. And it is not even radical in what it is supposed call for woman liberation as it is too pessimistic about half the world's population for such radical change to ever actually occur. It is not a celebration for womanhood but only a box of misery that knows no solutions only that the world is dark. The only light is that you are not alone in that suffering but others suffer with you. But what's the point of sharing that pain if you cannot move from it?  You accepted that this is how it is and it is no different from the idea that men are just naturally superior and have the right to decide what women should do. The existence equally is about women being preys and nothing more.",

Now I'm wondering about how that particular detail plays into the themes of the film and what it says about Mikey as a character. My first impression is that it gives us a further look into how much of a chameleon he is; he can adapt easily to certain situations if it'll help him achieve his goals. I've never tried it myself but I don't imagine it's very easy to stop speaking in your natural accent at the snap of a finger. Yet through this detail, Mikey shows that he's willing and capable of changing a fundamental aspect of himself if it'll get him what he wants, which amplifies the disappointment we feel at the end about him failing to learn anything and grow. He *could* become a better person if he really tried, but he won't because self-actualization isn't his priority. He will continue the same destructive patterns he's always known, exploiting the people around him and only changing himself superficially as a means to an end.",

I feel a large jury system (and hell, still add a general voting for juries to consider into their decisioning) will be able to focus on active members all debating about what the actual best movies are in their respective dept. and why. You'd have filmmakers considering more international things and overall more interesting nominations. The Oscars legitimacy and respect would go back up (You wouldn't get the typical \"Oscars popularity contest\" comment as much).\n\nIt could even help viewership, in the same way that people look forward to knowing who the nominees and host will be, you could build up anticipation for who the jury board for that particular year would be.

I had seen the 1959 film adaptation about a month or two ago for the first time ever, and must admit that I ultimately prefer the 1959 film adaptation, as I feel that it does a better job of delving into Peola’s identity issues (however, I understand that 1934 and 1959 were very different time periods, so perhaps there was more that couldn’t be shown/discussed or covered in the 1934 adaptation.) As a black girl, I must admit that I also felt the black mother (who is named Delilah in this adaptation as opposed to Annie) felt like more of a “Manmy” stereotype. Something I did like about this film is that I feel that the actress who played Peola in the 1934 adaptation “looked” more like a white passing woman (like someone who was at least mixed w black) than the actress who played Peola in the 1959 version. However, I found myself wishing that we had witnessed more of her internal struggle. Overall, I actually felt this to be a decent film - I feel it conveys a lot about black history/how black women were perceived, if you try to look at this film through a historical lens.",

        "text": "This article has a bunch of film stills. To see a fully illustrated version click here - [https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/shahram-mokris-innovative-fish-and-cat/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/shahram-mokris-innovative-fish-and-cat/)\n\nI have seen four films that were shot in one take: [***Victoria***](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/the-balance-of-form-and-content-in-victoria/)***,*** *Russian Ark,* [***The Body Remembers When the World Broke Open***](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/the-body-remembers-when-the-world-broke-open-storytelling-in-real-time/), and now Shahram Mokri's *Fish and Cat*. Each of the four films has its own reason for using such a challenging technique, but *Fish and Cat* is different from the others. It uses the one-shot format in an innovative way that reconfigures the whole process.\n\nWhen shooting a film in one shot, great care must be taken to produce a continuous, coherent narrative. *Russian Ark, Victoria*, and *The Body Remembers When the World Broke Open* all use a straightforward chronological structure. It seems almost impossible to make a single-shot film in any other way. Time is chronological, or at least we experience it as chronological, so it only makes sense that the plot of a one-shot film would have to work the same way, but Mokri manages to slide forward and backward in time, creating weird loops that turn both the plot and the images into an uncanny, deja-vu möbius strip. It’s fascinating.\n\nI cannot imagine how *Fish and Cat* was planned. Mokri could not have used a standard screenplay format or a simple storyboard. He would have to have planned the blocking like an elaborate magic trick, where actors slip out of a frame and then secretly run to a different location where they can be discovered again. \n\nThe result is disturbing and disorienting. We watch a character move forward in time, until he or she stumbles across a scene we have already seen before. We end up watching the same encounter from several different points of view, as the event is positioned and repositioned in several different sequences.\n\nEven more disorienting is when the dialogue unexpectedly loops back on itself, but there is no cut or marker to help us know when the repetition started. In Bergman’s *Persona*, Bergman uses jump cuts and switches points of view in order to blur the objective and subjective experience of the viewer, but in *Fish and Cat*, the switches are fluid and pass unrecognized, leaving us adrift in an unnavigable sea of time.\n\nMokri often mentions MC Escher as the inspiration for *Fish and Cat*. Mokri thinks of the flow of time in his films as a kind of visual representation of what Escher does in his illustrations. Both Mokri’s films and Escher’s prints defy linear time by eliminating a beginning or an end. What you are left with is a kind of process that implies time and space exist, but in some eternal tangle that prevents progress.\n\n*Fish and Cat* most certainly has a plot. The film was marketed as a horror or slasher film, but it’s as if the plot encounters temporary whirlpools that reorient our point of view both temporally and spatially.\n\nThe film is based on a true story. Apparently, a restaurant in a rural area somewhere in northern Iran was caught serving human meat. This is explained with text at the beginning of the film which sets up a sinister expectation. This is then intensified by having one of the characters carry around a rancid bloody sack wherever he goes. It’s a package of portable menace that we follow throughout the film.\n\nThe film is full of implied violence, indirect tension, and unspoken fear. Very little actually happens, but the camera travels all around the woods as the characters try to figure out what is going on. The single-shot format is in direct opposition to the content, which creates a tension in and of itself. Characters appear in places they shouldn’t. Events happen out of sequence, and we have to struggle to find our footing.\n\nChristophe Rezai’s score fits carefully into the disjointed flow of the film. It reminds me of how [**chanbara**](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/hideo-goshas-three-outlaw-samurai/) were scored in the 1960s. Instead of continuous music, Rezai provides small bursts of sound. Instead of a fully composed piece of music, we get clusters of melody and sound that underline what is happening on screen. There are also some longer passages of music that help build tension, as well as long sections of silence where the environmental sounds create their own sense of atmosphere and place. The variety of approaches keeps the music from overpowering the ambiguities by tying everything too neatly together.\n\nThe film itself experiments with different approaches. Some parts are narrated, sometimes by one of the characters, or sometimes by someone unknown. Some of the narration interferes with the dialogue, creating a strange mental space where we hear the characters reflecting on what they are saying in real-time. There are subtle similarities to other horror films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Sweeney Todd, but in the end, *Fish and Cat* is nothing like these other films. It doesn’t fit into the horror genre, or any genre. It is a tense depiction of anxiety and confusion that the audience enters into and then is left to negotiate.",

This one to me is interesting because the chickens are how Mrs Fox catches on to Mr Fox stealing and the cider almost drowns them and is also what rat commits his life to (but seems to have lost sight of by the end, not even being able to distinguish the taste from sewer water). \n\n-Ash's cape \n\n-The various hand signals \n\n-Mrs. Fox's thunderstorm landscapes\n\nThe list goes on and on, but these are some interesting ones that stood out to me.

The Cast that Alejandro assembled was Crazy, Salvador Dali, Orson Welles, Mick Jagger, Gloria Swanson, David Carradine, Amanda Lear, Herve Villechaize and Udo Kier. Jodorowsky also gotten Chris Foss, Jean Giraud, and H.R Giger for the Set and Character Designs and Dan O'Bannon for the Special Effects. Also Jodorowsky, estimated that the film could of been 10 Hours. \n\nDespite this, I will agree that Jodorowsky was a nut and that anything he says and how he got everyone to agree on this should be debated and that he probably exaggerated some events. Regardless, the way Jodorowsky say these things and using his charm, how can you not be excited for what he says and that you believe it to be true.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the Documentary, Jodorowsky's Dune?\n\nWhat would the reaction be if Jodorowsky actually made this film back in 1976?",

I am not talking about the mammoth of a production that it took to make this film, that is fantastic.\n\nI am not talking about the visuals and atmosphere, they are fantastic and you really couldn't get a film made like this anymore, the visuals are on the level of Come and See and Apocalypse Now.  \n\n\nAnd I am not talking about the soundtrack, I love what Popol Vuh did with the music and it really adds to the movie.\n\nHOWEVER.  \n\n\nThere are a few issues with the film that I feel everybody seems to overlook and just sort of go along with because it's 'supposed' to be this amazing thing.\n\nIt really all has to do with the Foley, Dubbing, and acting used in the film. I understand that the sound on set was considered unusable and so they had to redo it all in post, but ultimately I think it really damages the film and takes you out of the immersion. Even though the budget was small I still feel they should've spent much more time trying to get the foley better, because often it just comes across as a amateur student level production as far as sound mixing goes.\n\nThe dubbing in both German and English is also really poor. You look at them talking and you can just tell 100% that their voices do not match their character, which again, pulls you out. It's exacerbated  when you see actors who are clearly not the most experienced in speaking English trying to do so and pull off a good performance. I feel it really hurts the overall experience. (I was made aware that Herzog considered that the German version of his 1979 Nosferatu film was superior for this main reason, the German cast could concentrate more on their performances and not making sure they got the language right.\n\nThis acting can sometimes be ignored, but too often you get these moments of extreme woodenness that pull you out, like the Indian Prince's speech with the lady, or the bit towards the end where the guy gets stabbed and he says 'I thought it would hurt more than this' and I was like, \"Oh come on, thats awful!\". Some of the cast also feel bored to be there.\n\nAlong with this, I feel at times the pacing is just off, it drags on for too long, which shouldn't be a problem with a more visual experience film, but imo it really does just outstay its welcome too many times, which is odd because its only 90 minutes long.  \n\n\nYou may think I'm just some shmuck who put on the youtube version and watched it now for the first time, but I've watched it first several times over 10 years ago in both dubs before I went to film school, and rewatching it now, I still have the some hangups that I had back then.  \n\n\nIt's not terrible, I WANT to love it, I just wish more people would be honest and point out that whilst it is certainly a fab film, it has some seriously bad elements that really let down what could have otherwise been a truely amazing experience beginning to end.  \nI tend to watch it in the German version just so I don't get too distracted by the terrible dub.",

        "text": "The ending of Babylon has been one of the most controversial aspects of the film, with a lot of criticism directed its way. I'm interested to what thoughts everyone has. Personally, I am a fan of the ending and think it worked- though it could have been handled better, and I understand the criticism. I just don't agree with opinions that are saying it's overly indulgent or movie-ruining.\n\nThese are my main thoughts on it: \n\nThe montage shows technological progress and how movies will continue to change and captivate their audiences. When watching Babylon, you're made to feel almost sad and nostalgic for the silent movie era- it's presented with tinges of glory and romance, but then we watch the lives and careers of our characters be destroyed as the industry changes and the characters are left behind. I know as I was watching the ends of the characters, there was a part of me wishing \"Can't we go back to the old times where everyone was partying and having fun and making movies because they loved them\".\n\nBut the silent era was just as disastrous and dangerous for many, and the film shows you that. People die on set, it's incredibly chaotic, there's blood, shit, sweat, etc. The montage essentially shows you that Hollywood will always evolve, and there will always be people left behind. For every movie, every era, lives will be destroyed and left in the dust.\n\nThe ending of Babylon is like the ending of La La Land, where we watch the montage of what the couple's beautiful life could have been like and we're wishing with all our heart that this could be real, and they could be happy, but we know that this dream will end and we'll have to be brought back to reality. We're made to believe in this dream even though we know it's not real. By watching the montage, we're made to believe in the magic of movies but we're also forced to remember the horrible things that had to happen to bring us these movies. Two things can be true- Hollywood has brought us these amazing films that have affected us and made us believe, but Hollywood is also an awful, insidious business.",

        "text": "This long-awaited sequel delves deeper into the fantastical world that James Cameron constructed for the original. As well as featuring a more elaborate story, on top of improved visuals, which come together to build a massive and awe-inspiring experience.\n\n‘The Way of Water’ takes the Pandora we know and love and fills it with new characters and concepts. The stars of the previous film step aside to allow these new characters to blossom and develop through their own storylines. Each one a tale of self-acceptance and trust, which eventually culminate into an exciting climax. The final fight is impressively shot, if a little messy at times, especially as the action drags on. However, it sets up for a more emotional climax which ties together the plots and themes of the film in a beautiful way. For me, this interwoven collection of journeys is a breath of fresh air amidst the formulaic narratives seen in other adventure films, which often sacrifice emotional development to cram in as much action as possible. As a result, the film thrives with its increased number of characters and storylines.\n\nLike the original, the sequel is also a massive step forward for film technology and CGI. To shoot ‘The Way of Water’, Cameron and his team combined new 3D cameras with improved animation technology so that he could capture performances in water, and achieve more realistic underwater visuals. This was to match his vision as director, as this film focuses mainly on the beautiful oceans of Pandora (as the title suggests). This innovation is paired with well-crafted cinematography, and uniquely designed alien landscapes to create otherworldly shots. What’s better, is that the film gives the audience time to appreciate the most stunning images. For these reasons, the film is mesmerising, and leaves the audience fully immersed in the world.\n\nI was also impressed with the world building of the film, considering the ambitious plans for the future of the Avatar franchise (which includes 3 more sequels). It’s become a trend in larger franchises to litter their films with unresolved details and extra characters, forcing the audience to watch all of their previous instalments just to understand what’s going on in one. ‘The Way of Water’ avoids this to some extent. Although some plot points are left unresolved by the end, the film concludes with its characters having completed their individual journeys. This creates a satisfying, self-contained narrative. And any hints towards the wider world of Avatar (and the future sequels), are small, and sprinkled carefully throughout the film, as to not overwhelm the audience with information or pressure.\n\nTo conclude, ‘The Way of Water’ is a unique film experience with stunning visuals, and a more ambitious narrative than its predecessor. It features carefully planned world-building, and sets up future films without taking away from its own plot.",

        "text": "So, after constant praise and worshipping of the film in different communities and sites, I finally saw Bela Tar's 'satantango' which notoriously 7.5 hours in length. \n\nPrior of seeing the movie I've heard that people say that the the 400+ minutes are worth it beacuse of Tar's magical long takes that help to immerse you in world of the film, and I like that. I think that long takes serve a purpose in better Framing the character's situation and to further immerse the audience In the film's world. So when everyone said that this is exactly what happened in satantango, I had high expectations.\n\nBut after seeing this film, I can safely say that I was bored to death. and yes, this movie has amazing shots and great long takes with impressive choreography throughout the scenes. But Jesus Christ this movie has not even the slightest understanding of pacing whatsoever. We spend about about 25 minutes in watching the same dance scene from two different points of view, even though this scene serves literally no purpose in both points of view. Not to mention the constant shots of people simply walking, just for the sake of it.\n\nCan someone explain to me what is the purpose of those scenes? \n\nFrom either filmmaking perspective or story perspective? \n\nBeacuse after watching the film I got nothing but boredom and frustration.\n\n(Sorry for any mistakes or misspells, I'm typing with my phone)",

I think it was raining outside, too.  There's a woman in the shop who works there and she is quickly attracted to him so she lets him in despite the place closing down.

A similar thing could be said about vaporwave music, too: a huge thing online, but nonexistent in the legacy media world.\n\nCan you think of any recent movies that have used niche music as soundtracks or even as background music?",

It’s a bit obtuse because we don’t see him on screen after that scene but it’s a decent chunk of movie in between the rejection and his death and clearly enough time has passed for Siobhan to move away and write to Padraic. Just wondering if there was something I missed or this was the clear implication. Padriac says he must have slipped in which seems a bit out of left field and obviously the dad didn’t do it as he’s shocked when he sees the body. Thanks.",
