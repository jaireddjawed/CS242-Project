        "text": "Last summer my girlfriend went on a 2 month trip in Europe. About a month into her trip I started getting an uneasy feeling like something was happening over there - like she wasn't faithful. I don't know what planted that seed. I can't remember why I felt this way or how I came to that feeling. We had been in a committed relationship for 3 years and I had never experienced jealousy or relationship insecurity once. But something just felt... off. The ensuing anxiety and inability to feel reassured by her due to our distance drove me crazy. My behaviour became more and more erratic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started monitoring her social media activity. If I texted her I would check to see how long it took for her to reply, knowing that she was on her phone all the time. I would monitor her \"last time on facebook\" activity, and her instagram likes and story posts. When she'd text me back hours later and say she hadn't been on her phone/ there was a poor connection I knew she was lying. This would consume me with rage/fear/insecurity. I would oscillate between being convinced she was unfaithful to feeling like I was acting crazy and sabotaging my amazing relationship because I was insecure. I must an anxiety disorder, I thought. This was torture. Absolute and complete torture. I hope none of you ever experience the way I felt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring this time, I started watching Black Mirror. Netflix is an easy distraction when things aren't going well in life. But black mirror was far from an easy distraction. Each episode was challenging in its own way. I've never felt so entertained and exhausted by anything in my whole life. Then I put on The Entire History of You.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first 5 times I watched it I couldn't make it past the dinner party scene in the first act. I would start panicking every time I tried to watch it. It captured how I felt perfectly. We both had a beautiful, sweet and intelligent girl who loved us and without evidence - just an inexplicable gut feeling - we felt like something wasn't right. It was hitting too close to home and I gave up on this episode.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend came home. She repeatedly denied anything had happened with anyone. That she always has and always will be faithful. We came to an understanding and I was able to emotionally limp along for the next year. Things went mostly back to normal but about once a month I would become convinced something wasn't right again. The smallest details set me off. I'd see a text from a guy friend from Europe that she never spoke about. I noticed her becoming highly protective of her phone. I noticed that was no longer in any of her social media stories. Was she hiding something or was this a response to me acting suspicious about her? She would become furious any time I alluded to this - a plausible response if she were either innocent or guilty. I was in over my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 3 months ago I was finally able to finish the Entire History of You. We all know what happens. It's completely devastating. I was holding back tears and my heart was thundering. His life. His emotions. His behaviour. **It was me.** I hated what I saw and it made me physically sick. This was my fucking life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short - I eventually broke into her phone. Translated texts (she was fluent in the language of the country she visited) from a guy I was suspicious about. Sussed out that they were flirting. She denied anything happened but that she agreed that she was \"toeing the line\". I demanded to see all her messages or I'd break up with her right then and there. She agreed. I translated more. Sussed out that they had been fucking him behind my back for a month, carrying on a long distance relationship, and that she was planning on seeing him again this summer after spending time with me in Europe.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI immediately broke up with her, wished her the best and removed any evidence of her from life. Blocked her phone and and social media and haven't contacted her since. 2.5 months have gone by. I haven't felt this good in more than year. Not a hint of anxiety since the immediate aftermath of our breakup.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason why I'm writing this mess of a long post about my personal life on this board is because I wanted to say that no other piece of art or media has affected me in the way that this episode has. And isn't that what art is supposed to do - to challenge you to think and feel? I don't like this episode of Black Mirror. In fact I hate it. But it by that definition this episode is the greatest piece of art I've ever experienced. Sorry for getting carried away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know you're all judging me right now. I'm judging me too. I'm not proud of my behaviour. But being in love with someone who you don't trust will disassemble who are bit by bit - especially, if at the same time, you don't trust yourself. I've learned so much and will never let this happen to me again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;**\n\n**I had also been suspicious of my long term girlfriend of cheating on me while I watched The Entire History Of You. The episode was too devastating to watch. Pursued and discovered my ex had been cheating on me just like on Black Mirror. Came to the realization that no other piece art affects me like this episode does.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Especially that moment when she talks about her husband and daughter. Her face and tone changes, and she actually speaks like an older person.\n\nBest director : Euros Lyn for 15 million merits. The pace, the visuals, the song, the speech. Actors directing. A masterpiece.\n\nBest scenario : White Bear. Smart, disturbing, gut wrenching and unexpected. \n\nBest supporting actress : Natalia Tena in White Christmas.\n\nBest supporting actor : Jimmi Simpson in USS Callister.\n\nBest young actor : Alex « i want moneeeeeey » Lawther without any doubt !\n\n",

What do you think of the show?\n\nI think it will also be so interesting if black mirror releases a drug trial episode. Although Playtest is kind of similar. ",

It's not really about the stories themselves but about the fact that they are supposed to be a critique/warning on society. The way this show exists and the way it's talked about could only be this way if our world is fucked.\n\nWhen I started watching the show I found it boring and unnecessary. I felt like the points it tried to make were way too obvious (not obvious as in easy to predict, as in they shouldn't need to be made).\n\nIf the points it makes are so obvious but the show is still regarded as genius and treated with such respect, it has to be because to a lot of people, those points don't seem obvious. \n\n\"White Bear\" is the most extreme example of this.",

And a conversation i had with a German guy who was into Hinduism big time. And this was in London.\n\nBasically, we were talking about what the world is coming to and being from India myself I explained to him that our ancient texts warn of a bleak future where everything is controlled, girls aged 14 getting knocked up (word to word written back in 2000B.C.) and people not remembering anything and love wudnt exist. And my German friend mentioned something extraordinary which seemed unreal in 2001. He said the accelerated path towards that event mentioned in Bhagavad Gita, is neccesary and will bring everything back to the something where humans have to press the reset button.\n\nI have watched being without mobile and internet from 2001 to being introduced to MSN messenger, than orkut, facebook and what not. We are accelerating towards social doom and govt controlled everything. And to be honest, leaving tech behind and deleting apps and selling laptops, cameras etc have a positive effect on one's mind and life. ",
