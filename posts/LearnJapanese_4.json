        "text": "Hi all, I have been taking Japanese classes online at my local community college for the past few semesters (Japanese I-IV and Conversational Japanese I) and I am approaching a crossroads with my studies because there are no more courses left for me to take at this institution. I already have a bachelor’s degree and began taking Japanese classes just for fun, but I’m really enjoying it and I want to continue learning. I’m just not sure which direction I should go moving forward.\n\nI work for a university so I am able to take classes here at a very affordable tuition rate, but my job requires me to work 40 hours during the week and all of the language classes offered are in-person during the week. This just is not feasible with my current position. However, my university is a pretty reputable institution and offers a graduate program that would allow me to combine my interests from my previously earned BA as well as a BA in Japanese (a requirement for the MA program), so it’s pretty appealing. Having a master’s degree will allow me to earn a higher salary in higher education, but I’d definitely have to quit my job and pay the full tuition rate to be able to do this.\n\nI’ve also been thinking about simply taking a few weeks/months to attend a Japanese language school out in Tokyo instead. In the end, learning the language is ultimately my goal, so I suppose I don’t necessarily need the degree. However, I’m older (will be 35 this year) and I recall some language schools having age restrictions so I’m not sure if this is even a viable option. I think I would be able to take an extended leave of absence from work to do this, but it might be tough to obtain approval from my supervisor.\n\nJust wondering if anyone has some insight! I’m totally at a loss for what I should do next. Thanks!",

        "text": "I figured it would be fun to do some textual analysis for Japanese learners. Particularly because the game has the original calling cards in-game (just like a lot of other items throughout the game). \n\n*Calling card -* *予告状 - (Yokokujou)*: For those wondering what it is, In the game, Persona 5, these cards were sent by the Phantom Thieves to the persons they target, indicating an imminent attack on their psyche to \"change their heart\", i.e. to make them confess what they have done and change their ways. Basically the card outlines their particular crime, why they're being targeted, and informs them that the attack is coming the following day. \n\n(The Japanese word for \"calling card\" which is 予告状 (Yokokujou). Oddly enough, in the soundtrack, the lyrics of the battle song \"Take Over\" make reference to a \"prior notice card\" which is a direct translation of the word.)\n\nThis is the last one. I cannot recall it being even read out in-game, so this may be the first time any of you have seen the contents.  \n\n\n  \n*Original text:*  \n丸喜拓人は、  \n人々の幸せを願うあまりに  \n独善的な現実を創り出す大罪を犯した。  \nしかし我々は偽りの幸福に浸るのではなく、痛みを乗り越えてでも前に進みたい  \n故に貴殿の提唱する救済を受け入れることは出来ない。  \nよって、我々がその『歪んだ欲望』を頂戴することにした。  \n俺たちの未来を、返してもらう。  \n**心の怪盗団より**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n*English (my translation, not necessarily the English translation of the game):*  \nMaruki Takuto,  \nhaving excessively desired for people's happiness,  \nyou have committed a great crime by (thus) creating a self righteous reality.  \nHowever rather than be submerged in a fake happiness, we wish to overcome any pain necessary and move forward.  \nTherefore, respectfully, we cannot accept your offer of salvation / (the salvation you are proposing).  \nConsequently, we have decided to take your \"distorted desires\".  \nWe will get our future back.  \n**From the Phantom Thieves of Hearts**  \n\n\n  \n*Romaji:*  \nMaruki Takuto ha,  \nhitobito no shiawase wo negau amari ni  \ndokuzenteki na genjitsu wo tsukuridasu daizai wo okashita  \nshikashi wareware ha itsuwari no koufuku ni hitaru no de ha naku, itami wo norikoete de mo mae ni susumitai  \nyue ni kiden no teishou suru kyuusai wo ukeireru koto ha dekinai.  \nyotte, wareware ga sono \"yuganda yokubou\" wo choudai suru koto ni shita.  \noretachi no mirai wo, kaeshite morau.  \n**kokoro no kaitoudan yori**  \n\n\n  \n***Notes:***\n\n丸喜拓人:  Maruki Takuto. Welcome back to the wonderful rabbit hole of Japanese names. \n\nProbably different ways to read this, 丸 (maru) round, complete and 喜 (ki) for happy come to mind. Basically a fitting name for this individual, \"who wants everyone around him to be happy\".\n\nNo \"dono\" here. They know him, and probably respect him.  \n\n\n独善 (dokuzen): self-righteous. This seems to be his denounced \"sin\".  \n\n\n歪んだ (yuganda) is the past form of 歪む (yugamu). 歪 is a \"Hyougai\" Kanji outside of the two official lists. Meaning to \"be distorted\", (even the kanji itself is made of two parts, \"not\" at the top and \"correct\" at the bottom). It's an important term throughout the game.  \n\n\n救済 (kyuusai) : salvation, rescue, being saved  \n\n\n頂戴する: a nice formal way of saying to take, to gladly accept taking something.\n\nてでも (te de mo): construction using the -te form, \"nomatter, to do x\"\n\n貴殿 (kiden): Also used in Sae's calling card, this is a respectful form of address, which is why I added that word in brackets in the translation above.   \n\n\nことにした (Koto ni shita): part of the \"koto ni suru\" grammatical construction, i.e. to be decided, to decide on\n\n未来 (mirai): Should be a common word, but just in case: it means the future, consisting of too characters \"not yet\" and \"come\".\n\n怪盗団 (kaitoudan): The Phantom Thieves, or literally, \"ghostly thief band\". all 1 word with 3 characters.  \n\n\nより (yori): It's a special \"yori\" here, not the comparative one, used to say less than/more than. Rather here it is similar to \"kara\" meaning from.\n\n  \n\nI hope my posts have been helpful and have added to your enjoyment of the game, and to your memories thereof.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n*Previous posts:*\n\n[First Calling Card (Kamoshida)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10usyu7/persona_5_first_calling_card_kamoshida/)\n\n[Second Calling Card (Madarame)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/114xbyo/persona_5_second_calling_card_madarame/)\n\n[Third Calling Card (Kaneshiro)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1197pw4/persona_5_third_calling_card_kaneshiro/)\n\n[Fourth Calling Card](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/11avlbd/persona_5_fourth_calling_card_japaneseenglish/)\n\n[Fifth Calling Card](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/11cffo0/persona_5_fifth_calling_card_japaneseenglish/)\n\n[Sixth Calling Card](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/11efwr3/persona_5_sixth_calling_card_japaneseenglish/)",

When I first started I downloaded the 2k/6k deck because it's the most recommended here. I've had suspicions that some words it teaches are misleading and after my reviews today I'm even more concerned. One of the cards said that なかなか means 'not at all' or 'hardly' but I know from wanikani and jisho that it actually means 'very'. Another example is when the deck describes ずっと as 'all day' when it more realistically means 'continuously'. Little things like this make me feel like I'm being misled a bit. I would attach images of the cards but I don't think I can in this sub. What do you guys think? Am I just not skilled enough yet to understand why the deck is describing words like this? Or is it an actual issue? Thanks in advance. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",

I hope this question is specific enough not to be rejected. \n\n Last week I had to be removed from a translation project and a wonderful team. Work quality was good, but every time I have to talk or even chat to my colleagues anxiety causes my brain to blue screen. Even doing aizuchi literally hurts. So they put me on mental health timeout for the past week.\n\nDuring that time I rested my brain and did some self reflection. Even if I do manage to control the anxiety symptoms, I actually have no idea what words exactly to use when I have to ask a question or make a report. And when I see the translation comments I can’t even remember if I encountered such words during studying (self-study or class or intracompany learning). Not to mention the anxiety and depression prevented my brain from immersion and learning. So I was stuck in a loop of study &gt; immerse and speak at work &gt; don’t know what words/phrase to use &gt; anxiety kicks in &gt; mess up &gt; fall into depression &gt; study again.\n\nI know nurses and caregivers in particular get specialized Nihongo training. But I wonder if there are similar courses offered to other specialties. And if not, how do professionals especially translators learn the terms and phrases needed? \n\nIf I learned them beforehand maybe I would have communicated better and not bring myself grief, so before I start a new task with a rested mind I was hoping to get input and advice on what to do.

I don't watch anime in Japanese so I'm not used to hear the language.   \n\n\nAs wrote on the post title, I will be studying abroad in Japan for 6 months next year (all the classes I will take will be in English) and I also will take Japanese language classes based on my level when I arrive there. \n\nWhat I thought of doing was use Duolingo for the time being until summer vacation that starts in July (I'm a college student in Spain and I have 3 months of holidays) and start studying with books and other resources this 3 months because I will have the time to do so. After this 3 months I don't know how I should continue learning Japanese (maybe continue using Duolingo or other apps)\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) How would you recommend me study the language with the base I could have then?

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm currently working on a translation project for a Japanese visual novel, and I've come across a Chinese character who speaks with a stereotypical Chinese accent (ending sentences with \"aru\"). I'm having trouble deciding the best way to translate her dialogue into English, and I was hoping to get some input from the community.\n\nHere are the options I'm considering:\n\n1. Ignore the accent: Should I simply translate her dialogue without including the \"aru\" at the end of her sentences? This would make her dialogue sound more natural in English, but it would also mean that I'm not fully capturing the character's accent.\n1. Add \"aru\" to the end of sentences: Alternatively, I could include \"aru\" at the end of each of her sentences to convey her accent. However, I'm not sure if this would come across as too gimmicky or make her dialogue hard to read.\n1. Write her dialogue in a stereotypical Chinese accent: Another option would be to write her dialogue with a stereotypical Chinese accent in English (e.g. \"Me so solly\"), but I'm worried this could come across as offensive or insensitive.\n1. Add appropriate Chinese words and phrases: Finally, I could add appropriate Chinese words and phrases to her dialogue to emphasize her ethnicity and cultural background. However, this could also make the dialogue harder to read for English-speaking audiences who aren't familiar with Chinese.\n\nWhat do you think would be the best approach? I'm open to any suggestions or advice. Thanks in advance for your help!",

        "text": "I wasn’t sure how to word a google search for what I was wondering, so I thought I could ask it here instead.\n\nCan I just add 「者」to the end of na-adjectives or nouns to turn them into “person/people who X”? Or are there particular rules for what can/can’t be changed like that that I should be taking into account? \n\nI was under the impression that nouns and na-adjectives function similarly a lot of the time so I figured that it would work for both if it worked for one. I don’t know if it can be done to i-adjectives... maybe it can?\n\nI learned that 勝者 is “winner/victor” and 傷者 is “wounded person” (both spelled like 「しょうしゃ」but sounding slightly different from what I can tell). “Win person” and “wound person”. Can I write pretty much anything-person and have it be correct Japanese? Or does it sound awkward?\n\nI also heard an example where it seemed like the -ます at the end of a verb was replaced by もの to just become “people that do X verb”. Is that something that can be done with just about any verb either? Or is there nuance here that I don’t know about? Maybe it’s only transitive verbs? I know about 「たべもの」and 「のみもの」as food and beverage; can those also mean “people that eat / people that drink” if the 「もの」is 「者」instead of 「物」?\n\nI’m sorry if I’m wording this question in a sort of stupid way. I think what I’m asking is similar to the usage of those clauses that are like, “*just-finished-a-soccer-game-woman* is eating lunch” where it’s like a whole sentence inside the sentence describing attributes of the subject and that that’s normal to do.\n\n\nTLDR: can someone explain in really basic terms when you can add もの or しゃ to something to say “person/people who do/are like X” and have it sound normal? \n\nI don’t know if this is something really straightforward that I’m getting lost about, or if it’s actually something complex that I’m oversimplifying.\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to take the JLPT N2 test later this year. I would classify my current skills somewhere between N3 and N2 atm, from a listening and reading standpoint probably closer to N2, though my grammar when speaking/writing isn’t always correct, since I haven’t sat down to properly study grammar for years now. \n\nI was wondering if anyone is aware of an app/mobile friendly content that would let me casually study N2 grammar/phrases etc in preparation for the test. I do own the Shin Kanzen Master Series N2 books, but again, I don’t have the time to sit down and properly work through them anymore. \n\nAny help would be appreciated, thanks!",

I've been searching for a good one online without copyright issues, but I haven't found anything that meets my needs.\n\nSo, I've decided to create my own database using a google spreadsheet document. I've already added the top 3000 kanjis, but I could still use some help from the community to fill in the missing information. (The \"extra characters\" part is for characters which fall outside of the top 3000 kanji but are still used as elements within certain kanji of the main list)\n\nIf anyone is interested in helping out, I would greatly appreciate it! The spreadsheet is open for editing, so you can add new entries or make changes to existing ones. The kanji in the database will be used in the game and will remain publicly available for all to use, so please keep that in mind when adding new entries or making changes.\n\nHere's the link to the spreadsheet:  [Kanji Data - Google Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15d1nRc3zgdH6zBX8Jeu1YDIadNH7I5MNHts5ogKV9fk/edit#gid=0) \n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to leave a comment.\n\nThank you!",

What was the stuff that I watch I can’t put Japanese subtitles on, but some of the stuff I can. Does that actually help?\n\nHow do I improve grammar? In Japan, I learned grammar, naturally, for the most part, and whatever I learned in my class, because it was easy for me to apply in other areas. But now it’s kind of stagnant, how do you guys make sentence cards in Anki for that? How can I apply my grammar more? I am friends with some Japanese exchange students, but they mostly respond to me in English, even if I speak Japanese to them. With exceptions, of course.",

I study daily and I have about 750 hours of study time as of now. About 690 of those hours are new lessons, flashcards, and lesson reviews. The other 60 is a combination of listening practice (40 hours), speaking practice (10 hours), and reading practice (10 hours). The past few months I have been attempting to cut my flashcard/lesson review time and increase my native materials time.  \n\n\nI took at practice JLPT N5 test, for the first time yesterday, and I scored 125/180 which is passing. Honestly I am happy with my progress and how far I have come. (Never thought I'd be able to learn Japanese) However, I was hoping to be further along than I am.  \n\n\nMy main question is, am I making good progress given the time I have and effort I have put in or could I be doing much better? I am also curious if anyone has any advice for making my way to intermediate level. I feel like I haven't been making very much progress the past few months even though I have increased my consumption of native materials.",

This will prime you in the types of vocab and grammar used in these games.  Then when you go to play a game, it won't be as crazy\n\n**Tip 3:** Install a popup dictionary like yomichan.  Now you don't have to fool with drawing kanji into jisho.  Can make mining vocab easier as well.\n\n**Tip 4:** When you read something, make sure you understand all of it.  If not, post in the daily questions thread with a link to your script so people can have context.  Don't just skip a bunch of it because it is too hard, tough it out.\n\n**Tip 5:** General literacy helps.  I tried games, and it was pretty hard.  Then I read 13 books.  After that Then I had more vocab to pull from, so it wasn't as insane to jump into games and not know anything.  When mining words from books for general literacy, look for generic useful words and not niche words just used in that book.\n\nI want this to be a tips thread so post your tips in the comments.",

        "text": "I figured it would be fun to do some textual analysis for Japanese learners. Particularly because the game has the original calling cards in-game (just like a lot of other items throughout the game). To avoid spoiling plot points in the title, it just contains the number and not the name of the person it is addressed to.\n\n*Calling card -* *予告状 - (Yokokujou)*: For those wondering what it is, In the game, Persona 5, these cards were sent by the Phantom Thieves to the persons they target, indicating an imminent attack on their psyche to \"change their heart\", i.e. to make them confess what they have done and change their ways. Basically the card outlines their particular crime, why they're being targeted, and informs them that the attack is coming the following day. \n\n(The Japanese word for \"calling card\" which is 予告状 (Yokokujou). Oddly enough, in the soundtrack, the lyrics of the battle song \"Take Over\" make reference to a \"prior notice card\" which is a direct translation of the word.)  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Original text:*\n\n功を競うものたちへの妬み嫉みに我を忘れ、  \n出世欲に取り憑かれたる嫉妬の罪人、  \n新島冴殿。  \n出世のため「不正義」すら「正義」と唱える不実。  \nその罪の数々を、貴殿の口から告白させる事と決定した。  \nその歪んだ欲望を頂戴し、あるべき場所へ帰るといい。  \n**心の怪盗団より**  \n\n\n  \n\n\n*English (my translation, not necessarily the English translation of the game):*\n\nUtterly jealously competing with others for achievements having caused you to forget who you are,  \n(This is to) the criminal of envy, completely haunted and obsessed by her desire for social advancement / for her career,   \nMiss Nijima Sae  \nFor the sake of getting ahead, you will falsely advocate even injustice as justice.  \nWe have resolved to (respectfully) have you confess your many-fold crimes from your own mouth.   \nWe will take your distorted desires, and (thus) you should go back to where/(how) you should be.  \n**From the Phantom Thieves of Hearts**  \n\n\n  \n\n\n*Romaji:*\n\nIsao wo kisou monotachi he no netami-sonemi ni ware wo wasure  \nShusseiyoku no toritsukaretaru shitto no zainin,  \nNijima Sae-dono.  \nShussei no tame \"Fuseigi\" sura \"seigi\" to totonoeru fujitsu.  \nSono tsumi no kazukazu wo, kiden no kuchi kara kokuhaku saseru koto to kettei shita.   \nsono yuganda yokubou wo choudai shi, arubeki bashou he kaeru to ii.  \n**kokoro no kaitoudan yori**  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n***Notes:***\n\n新島冴殿:   Nijima Sae-dono. Welcome back to the wonderful rabbit hole of Japanese names. 冴 (Sae) is the character of her very beautiful first name, which means clear, lucid. 頭が冴える (Atama ga saeru) \"to be clear-headed\" is a common expression to note.\n\nAgain, note the final title \"dono\" which I translated with \"Miss\" here.  \"Dono\" is different from what the kanji, meaning \"lord\" implies. \"dono\" at the end of a name is, depending on the context, pejorative, as it implies the one addressing the other with that title is in a higher position. Like a teacher towards a student, or a superior at work vs. a junior colleague. A central theme of the game is rebellion against a world of uncaring, evil adults, therefore this inversion of teenagers addressing adults with this fits well.  \n\n\n\\-Now for some words on *Jealousy*:\n\nJapanese has several words for it, multiple of which seem to appear here. What doesn't appear here is the one most people have heard,  羨ましい (urayamashii) which is comparatively light (\"I'm sooo jealous\"). The jealousy here is that of envy, i.e. complete obsessive hatred to not get what others have.\n\n妬み嫉み  (netami-sonemi) : utter jealousy is how I translated it; a duplication of two words meaning the same thing.  \n\n\n嫉妬 (shitto): jealousy, envy (notice that they're the same characters as above just using their on readings). notice the pattern of the other calling cards and that this is Sae's great sin.  \n\n\nIn short, if there is one key takeaway for learners, then let it be that envy/jealousy is shit(to).\n\n出世 (shusse): A very common word worth remembering for which we don't have an exact translation in English. \"getting ahead in life, advancing socially, being apart of the rat race, successfully pursuing a career\"  \n\n\n正義 (seigi): simple word but worth remembering if you don't know it: Justice\n\n取り憑かれたる (toritsukaretaru): being completely haunted and obsessed with.  憑かれる (tsukareru) 's main character 憑 is another Hyougai Kanji outside of the two main lists (Jouyou and Jinmei). I would take this as an example that many characters outside of those learnt in the school curriculum are regularly used and written.  \n\n\n貴殿 (kiden): a very respectful form of address, usually in written documents, usually to people higher than you or the same.\n\n歪んだ (yuganda) is the past form of 歪む (yugamu). 歪 is a \"Hyougai\" Kanji outside of the two official lists. Meaning to \"be distorted\", (even the kanji itself is made of two parts, \"not\" at the top and \"correct\" at the bottom). It's an important term throughout the game.  \n\n\n頂戴する: a nice formal way of saying to take, to gladly accept taking something.\n\nあるべき (arubeki): how it should be, how ideally things should be. Notice here the form:  \n\n\nべき (beki). This is construction to say \"should\" which is general, norm-setting (and potentially very impolite if you use this to tell somebody to do something). It's like \"it should be this way, you should do this /should always be doing this / should already be doing this\". Think of a parents support group with the general message being \"we must take care of our children\".\n\n怪盗団 (kaitoudan): The Phantom Thieves, or literally, \"ghostly thief band\". all 1 word with 3 characters.  \n\n\nより (yori): It's a special \"yori\" here, not the comparative one, used to say less than/more than. Rather here it is similar to \"kara\" meaning from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this post on Persona 5 hermeneutics has been beneficial.  \n  \n\nPrevious posts:\n\n[First Calling Card (Kamoshida)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10usyu7/persona_5_first_calling_card_kamoshida/)\n\n[Second Calling Card (Madarame)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/114xbyo/persona_5_second_calling_card_madarame/)\n\n[Third Calling Card (Kaneshiro)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1197pw4/persona_5_third_calling_card_kaneshiro/)\n\n[Fourth Calling Card](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/11avlbd/persona_5_fourth_calling_card_japaneseenglish/)\n\n[Fifth Calling Card](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/11cffo0/persona_5_fifth_calling_card_japaneseenglish/)",

        "text": "Some background,\n\nI took a year of formal Japanese class back in my college days which got us through Genki 1. At this same time, I spent a lot of time with exchange students where I met my now wife who I started picking up casual language from. \n\nAfter graduating I join the military and spend about 2 years without studying Japanese, speaking with my wife in mainly English as we were LDR. \n\nI decide that I want to be as fluent in Japanese as I am with my native languages so I buy RTK 1 and used kanji koohii daily until I reached the point of about 1200 kanji. I used mainly custom koohii stories which I now have forgotten but are still in the koohii account and a RTK notebook I made with all the kanji I studied. Speaking to my wife she said my time would likely be more effectively by used by studying vocabulary and grammar points rather than by assigning arbitrary and often inaccurate English meanings to these kanji. Even though I said that I knew around 1,000 kanji, in reality and I did not know the actual meanings of most of these kanji and of course could not use it in writing nor read it in any sort of Japanese written material. Therefore at that time I dropped rtk and begin a full review of Genki starting from the beginning. I also discovered cure Dolly Channel as well as other channels which provided very good insight into grammar points in a way that the textbook did not cover in often cause confusion for me. \n\nWhere I am at at this point is I have gotten through the second half of Genki 2, and have completed a full run through Tango N5 Anki deck. I am working through the core 2k on Anki as well and have learned a lot of vocabulary through these decks. I also am reading books and manga and placing all unknown vocabulary into custom anki decks. This has been very effective for me in learning vocabulary. I speak with my wife and kids in Japanese which means I have outpaced in speaking and listening but have been lacking in reading and especially writing (I can never remember how to write most vocabulary I know). \n\nAs you can see I am dealing with the common problem of being unable to write in Japanese because although I know the word, I can only see a hazy foggy representation of it in Kanji in my mind. I always need to pull out a phone. Also I am facing the problem of confusing similar but different kanji, which leads to problems when reading. I am wondering if I could have avoided this if I had “learned” kanji with RTK or KKLC, Wanikani etc. \n\nI attempted Wanikani but the slow starting pace as well as the fact that it wants me to assign nebulous English meaning to “radicals” tried my patience. I have not looked in KKLC and don’t really know if brute forcing through RTK “primitives” again is an effective use of my time. \n\nI am thinking of doing it the schoolboy way and grabbing something like KKLC or just doing grade order and a kanji drill book and writing kanji I want to learn dozens or hundreds of times until they stick in my brain - using Anki to test my knowledge of the kanjis general meaning and most common Onyomi to drill more whenever I fail to recognize a learned kanji in the deck. It’s basically how my wife learned and how we are starting to teach our daughter. \n\nHas anyone has success with this sort of method? I am just afraid of investing a lot of time into foreign learner kanji courses to just remember primitive and made up meaning and stories about how some guy got water out of a well or whatever nonsense when my goal is to learn meaning and reading to aid in vocabulary. However, I have seen many people say these courses were the foundation of what led to their fluency in writing later on. \n\nI’m sorry for the long post, and appreciate any and all advice you guys can give.",
