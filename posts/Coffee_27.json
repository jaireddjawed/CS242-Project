        "text": "I was caught by surprise when the coffee machine in my hotel room was a Jura instead of a cheaper pod setup. Can anyone give me some tips for how to make a standard cup of coffee on a Jura? We ended up with 2 tablespoons of really strong brew at the bottom of our cups.  Milk, etc. was not available although the standard sugar and cream packets were. Is there some part of the machine that also makes hot water to be added to the cup after the coffee has dripped into it? I was not in the mood for a single swallow of espresso, rather i was hoping for a more leisurely experience with a full cup of joe. Sorry for my ignorance :)",

        "text": "Hi everyone, my mother - a chef who knows little about coffee except how to operate a Nespresso - is setting up a small village cafe and shop in the very small English village she lives in. The village recently lost its pub, so it's in need of somewhere for people to socialise, and it has potential for tourism. We hope to be able to bring a bit more social space and togetherness to the village.\n\nPart of the discussion has been about espresso and milk drinks, and I'm wondering what advice people here would have for a (very) small cafe setup in a cafe that won't have too many customers. The budget is limited, but I'm chipping in to help, and our rent will be very low due to the village hall helping.\n\nIt won't be intensive, the village only has 400 people, though might need to do several drinks in a row at peak times for when friends visit together and the after church rush hour. That said, I can't imagine my mother managing more than one drink at a time. I will be going down to the village to teach her how to operate everything, but my only experience is with basic home setups, and I'm also looking for barista courses in her county (Devon).\n\nDo you have any recommendations for grinders? Machines? We want the coffee to actually be decent - if the shop doesn't work I will use it in the future - but i'd say speed and a crazy efficient workflow aren't the greatest concerns.\n\nI guess the budget is somewhere around £1500, but can be extended for a really good reason.\n\nGrinder: Niche Zero? DF64? Malkohnig x54?\n\nMachine: No idea! But around the £1000 mark is probably our limit. Needs water tank options, as we can't do plumbing there. Someone in another thread recommended Rancillo Silvia.\n\nSecond hand: We'd be happy to go the second hand route, but have no idea how to find second hand equipment in the UK.",

A jar of roasted coffee beans caught my eye because it was selling like crazy, judging from the amount left - it said \"vanilla and orange\".\n\nNow, I tried lightly roasted beans and I know how fruity and acidic instead of bitter can such coffee taste, I knew that you can get some pretty interesting flavor notes from coffee beans.\n\nHowever, these beans looked darker than lightly roasted ones and they smelled like straight-up sweet oranges, the flavor you'd find in jaffa cakes. I was intrigued so I bought some (expensive af). I asked the guy who works there if this is somehow infused or do beans themselves naturally have that flavor - he said they just have that flavor.\n\nThis morning, I brewed me some (percolation method, don't judge me, I like it like that :P) and OH MY GOD... I'm just bewildered, confused and in awe... feels like I tasted something forbidden, arcane and incomprehensible to the human mind.\n\nIt tastes NOTHING like the basic \"coffee flavor\" most people are used to, it's almost sublime, no bitterness, a slight tinge of acidity and an unmistakeable delicious taste of oranges. It didn't taste like coffee with orange flavor added, it was its own thing, a complex flavor experience with a story from the moment the first notes hit you to the aftertaste you're left with.\n\nI never tasted a better drink in my life, no exaggeration.\n\nSo my question is - is it really possible to achieve such flavors through careful cultivation and roasting without introducing actual oranges at any point?",

So far, my cups have been... neutral. Bland even. Tastes fine for everyday coffee but that's not what I want. I would appreciate any tips or tricks!\n\nWhat I have:\n- Baratza encore upgraded to M2 burr\n- Kalita wave 185\n- Stagg gooseneck kettle\n\nMy most current attempt was 21 grams coffee at a finer grind in an attempt to get more flavor. Bloom 45 seconds with water set at 205 F. Pour 200 grams water and when the water is nearly gone, add 50 grams more. Repeat until 350 grams. Brew time was 3:30 min. The taste was still mediocre.\n\nI'm using filtered water and will be trying a different roast once I'm done with my current Stumptown medium roast. \n\nI am enjoying the experience and jotting down notes with each attempt.

I’ve always just dumped coffee in and hoped for the best with my french press and generally its decent. The moka pot i do water to the gasket and fill the basket but its always bitter. The pour over is hit or miss but i can make decent coffee i just dont know what to add to make it how i like it.\n\nId really like to start producing consistent and good tasting coffee. For context at timmies i order my coffee with 2 oat milk 1 sugar. Anywhere else i get an oat milk latte (caramel, vanilla coconut or gingerbread depending on seasons) but the tims by my work hired a bunch of new kids and i have trouble forcing their coffee down these days.

It's a double anaerobic processed coffee, which can definitely be divisive processing method, but really digging this one.\n\nI'm not local to them or have any skin in the game with them, but I appreciate a good bag/roaster recommendation as much as the next person.

        "text": "This is my 2nd experiment making Anaerobic coffees. \n\nCoffee Origin: Vietnam\n\nVariables for Fermenting: Cascara, wine yeast, bread yeast, natural fermentation(lacto)\n\nEach coffee that was fermented weighted in total about 2.5lbs each. Each had two cups of Brazilian cascara added to it, and covered entirely with water. I left the beans to hydrate for 4 hours, added more water as it soaked up. Once the beans were hydrated I introduced yeasts into two of them. One with a bread yeast, another with a wine yeast. The last container I did not add anything and let a lacto fermentation occur naturally. \n\nEach of these were fermented for 7 days, with water added halfway through. After 7 days, they were then rinsed and laid out on trays to dry out. After 6 days, they were fully dried out, I cleaned out the cascara and they were ready to roast. \n\nAll were roasted to a medium roast, and were rested for a day before brewing. I brewed using a v60, 10 grams of coffee and 150 grams of water.\n\nFlavor wise there was not a significant difference \n\nControl: Mellow, floral, with some acidity\nBread Yeast: Very similar, but less acidity and more mellow\nWine Yeast: Even less acidity, and more floral\nNatural/Lacto: Super floral(almost tastes like dill), least acidity\n\nOverall I think the yeasts didn’t provide the Anaerobic fermentation flavors I enjoyed so much in my first experiment, but the natural fermentation did. They didn’t really change the flavor of the coffee, but at least they did produce a less acidic and smoother cup. \n\nI think my next experiment I will attempt using Koji culture I have for making sake. Any other cultures or fermentation recommendations would be welcomed.",

        "text": "I recently bought a hand grinder (aergrind) and a bialetti 3 cup moka pot. I drink my coffee straight and its amazing. But my partner drinks coffee with milk every morning. Usually she adds in a large mug, 3 big spoons of instant coffee plus scalding hot milk without any water. This isn't ideal for her but its not viable to order a flat white every morning.\n\nSo I used James Hoffman's \"no machine\" recipe. 15g in and a beautiful slow 70ml extraction out of moka pot coffee. I add 70 ml of milk for a 1:1 ratio and the rest of the cup or mug I top with foam using a cheap milk frother. \n\nImmediately this has the problem of being too small a drink. Only 140ml compared to her usual 300ml drink. But I was willing to sacrifice that for an amazing potent cup. She likes its flavour exponentially more than the instant coffee but unfortunately, I've made it 3 times so far and every time she complained that it's too weak.\n\nHow can I make it even stronger? I have a few ideas I haven't tried yet. First is taking the grind to as fine as an espresso. I have no idea what the effect will be. 2nd is heating the moka pot at high heat to produce lots of bubbling and strong, harsh bitter coffee flavours. But then might as well just drink disgusting instant coffee if it tastes so bad. 3rd is making a full 150ml moka pot coffee and adding only a dash of 30ml of milk. It would be a completely different drink than her usually mostly coffee but i think its worth a try.\n\nAny other ideas?",

My wife is a fan of pumpkin spice flavor during fall but obviously that has come and gone. She has also discovered that she prefers what I make her at home, but that means it's difficult to order a drink at a shop that she enjoys. Here's my recipe for her drink at home:\n\n19.7g fresh ground coffee\n39.5g ish espresso out in about 22-25secs ( I'm not great at espresso yet)\n115g Tazo pumpkin spice latte from the carton\n115g whole milk steamed to a 1:1 foam:milk consistency at about 150F. \n\nShe loves this drink. But currently we're sitting at a great shop near our house where my wife has left another latte half finished. I tasted it and it tastes like a bowl of warm milk.\n\nIs there some way I can advise my wife to order her drinks that are more to her taste? I'm thinking she prefers the higher foam content of the drinks I make which dilutes the flavor of espresso less than a true late does.\n\nThanks for your advice!",

It's a Brazilian coffee with notes of stone fruits, dark chocolate, and caramel.  \n– I set the temperature by 3 degrees around 90 degrees because of the really bitter notes I've tasted.  \n– I am using the Single Wall 2 Cup basket.  \n– I am waiting for about 10 minutes after power on the machine. \n\nI started with 18g dose in, with grind size 6, and ended up with the highest pressure that is possible, so I started to experiment with a lower dose to end up with at least a relatively great pressure (I've read that the great is around 1 or 2 o'clock). After ending up with 15g dose with the same grind size, the pressure went kinda okay, it is the end of the pressure gauge, but the brew time was around 22-23 seconds including a 10-second pre-infusion. When I set the grind size to 5, it ends up with around 35-40 seconds, with the same high pressure. The drink is really bitter, I can't really taste the sweet notes that it is in the coffee. When I get it back to grind size 6, it's around 22-23 seconds. \n\nI'm a little bit clueless about what I should do or what I am doing wrong, because it feels like I am at the end of the ranges – an over-extracted coffee by its bitter taste and high pressure and under-extracted as well because of the quick extraction. Increasing the dose? Then isn't it going to be really high pressure? Grind finer or courser? Isn't this 9-10-second pre-infusion too much?\n\nI really appreciate any kind of help.",
