        "author": "Bhangbhangduc",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3vfwn6/this_godless_communism_a_1960s_comic_series_about/",
        "text": "DISCLAIMER: I'm a leftist, but I'll try to be objective. If I'm not, tell me.\n\nYou may follow my review in the text [here](https://archive.org/stream/ThisGodlessCommunism/treasure2#page/n1/mode/2up).\n\nEven if you don't know about *This Godless Communism*, you've probably seen parts of it, or are generally aware of it. It's basically the single greatest comic book example of commiephobia ever produced. Published in something called \"Treasure Chest of Fun and Fact\" in the early sixties, it was endorsed by J. Edgar Hoover for whatever that's worth. Hoover suggests in the preface that Americans should study and \"learn all about\" communism, which I think is an, uh, interesting tack.\n\nAnyway, we start of on page one with the assertion that:\n\n&gt;NOVEMBER 7^th 1917 ----- COMMUNISTS SEIZE PETROGRAD\n\nActually, this is promising. Apparently, Saint. Petersburg was renamed Petrograd in 1914 and thus would have been called Petrograd until it was renamed Leningrad. \n\n&gt;Modern communism got its first toehold in Russia through violence and bloodshed.\n\nI could quibble about the meaning of \"toehold\", \"in\", or \"Russia\", but since it's pretty clear that they're talking about Red October, I guess I'll let it slide.\n\n&gt;A revolution was organized by a small group of men who urged the people to attack their representative government. The people did this because they thought the communists would help them lead a more comfortable life. The people did not realize that for this promise of an easier life they were giving up their freedom!\n\nI don't know enough about the Kerensky government to pass judgement on it, but I will say a couple of things. First off, I think Kerensky's decision to continue WWI had something to do with it, and secondly and more importantly, I think it's a bit misleading to characterize the Russian government in 1917 as an established, free, representative body. Certainly it was more free than Tsarist autocracy, and probably freer than most of the Soviet Union, but still it was basically an emergency government. I'm not even sure they ever held elections.\n\nWe skip to a hypothetical - what if the USSR took over the USA. Apparently they do it in an afternoon, move the capital to Chicago, magic an American communist bureaucracy from somewhere (probably California), change all the flags, and still find time to keep public transportation moving and the schools open. I actually kind of impressed. \n\n**Page 7**\n\nThe page is headlined with images of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Josef Stalin, and Nikita Khrushchev superimposed over some patriotic Soviet imagery. I wouldn't really describe Nikita Khrushchev as an important thinker in communist history, but it was the sixties so whatever. Also Engels gets left out, as usual.\n\n&gt;The foundation of communism was laid many years ago by a writer named Karl Marx.\n\nCommunism and socialism definitely existed before Karl Marx. It's why The Communist Manifesto is aimed at describing a movement.\n\n&gt;From this man's mind has come one of the greatest dangers to the world that have ever existed.\n\nIf you're talking about nuclear war, then I guess so? I personally like Marx's ideas, but I guess if you don't then this can be justified. \n\n&gt;He was born in Germany in 1818, the son of a well-to-do lawyer.\n\nAn impressive feat, considering that this is 1818, and **Germany didn't exist yet**. \n\n&gt;**Herschel Marx:**\"I hope that some day he [Marx] will become a lawyer like myself.\"\n\nFirst of all, since Marx was Prussian, he would have been speaking German, not English. Secondly, this is a little stereotypically Jewish. Maybe it hasn't aged well, or maybe this comic is a little anti-Semitic.\n\n**Page 8**\n\n&gt;**Marx's Robot Buddy:**: \"I am both happy and surprised that you have become a Christian, Karl.\"\n\n&gt;**Marx:** \"Well, I'm not happy about it! My father changed his religion because it would help him in his business.\"\n\nOh. Anti-Semitic? Herschel Marx converted in 1817 because Prussia was cracking down on Jews. Marx was baptized at the age of six. Depicting a teenage Marx discussing his baptism as though it had just happened is then impossible. Saying that his father had converted to improve his business is problematic because it trots out anti-Semitic paranoia about secret Jews and connects it to greed. \n\nAlso, if you're anti-communist, depicting young Marx as a lantern-jawed radical like they do in panel 3 seems a bit stupid. \n\n&gt;**Marx:** \"I will attend only those classes that interest me. Let others attend the classes of fools!\"\n\nIs this not how schooling works? You study things that you are interested in and avoid those taught by fools?\n\n&gt;One of his favorite classes was taught by Professor George Hegel.\n\n&gt;**Hegel:** \"Newly created ideas are not freely created in our minds. They are forced on out minds by other ideas.\"\n\n&gt;**Marx:** (thinking) \"Good! He does not believe in a free will!\"\n\nFor some reason, I'm not surprised that the author doesn't understand Hegelian dialectics. Also, Marx didn't reject the idea of free will per se, he just thought that people belonging to different social classes acted in generally similar ways.\n\n**Page 9**\n\nMarx and some classmates are discussing Hegel over some beers. Lederhosen-wearing classmate says he \"talks nonsense.\"\n\n&gt;**Marx:** I disagree. His way of thinking is correct. But it should be applied to things around us, too, not just ideas.\"\n\nThis appears to be an interpretation of the quote that is now on Marx's grave:\n\n&gt;The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.\n\nSuddenly, yellow-shirted classmate butts in.\n\n&gt;We Catholics know that no ideas are __forced__ on our minds. God has given us a mind with which we make free choices every day. The kind of choices we make every day will decide if we go to heaven or hell.\n\nI'm sure that went over well in (Protestant) Berlin.\n\nThe rest of the page is about how dialectical materialism is against god and how Karl Marx keeps a dirty room. Curiously, he appears to be wearing blue jeans, which while probably existent, would be a little anachronistic. \n\n**Page 10**\n\nMarx tries to explain materialism to his friends, one appears to be finding mathematical proofs of god, another involved in painting a green book orange. The real historical issue is at the end of the page, which says that\n\n&gt;Thus, Marx formed three important parts of communist belief:\n\n&gt;1. No spiritual things exist, only material.\n\n&gt;2. History is necessarily a conflict between the rich and the poor.\n\n&gt;3. From this struggle will come the rule of the workers over all other people. And this will be perfectly good.\n\nFirst of all, communism isn't something Marx thought up one night in college. Secondly, communism doesn't divide people into rich and poor, but rather into proletariat and bourgeoisie. The proletarian supplies capital via labor while the bourgeoisie controls the labor force and thus the capital. They don't necessarily map to rich and poor, they just tend to. Thirdly, communism aims not to put one group of people above another, but to make the labor force the controller and beneficiary of the capital they produce.\n\n**Page 11**\n\n&gt;**Marx:** \"We will hasten our heaven on earth by urging the workers to overthrow their masters by force and violence. Then we will form governments that will own all the property in the country.\"\n\nOkay, so socialism can be a bit Utopian at times, but this is ridiculous. I like how they imply that workers are supposed to have masters. And I'm not even going to touch that last sentence, it's so wrong, though I guess a fairish description of how the USSR worked.\n\nMoving on, Engels appears, attempting to impress his date by talking to her about communism. This rarely works. The worst part is\n\n&gt;**Engels' date:** But how could governments with that much power just die out on their own?\n\n&gt;**Engels:** \"I'm afraid herr Marx hasn't explained that to me yet.\" *\n\n&gt;*Editor's note: Neither Marx nor any other communist has attempted to explain this strange belief.\n\nOn the one hand, I think few people have made serious conjecture as to the precise nature a fully communist world. And yes, Marx was pretty vague on the what such a world might look like. On the other hand, orthodox Marxism, IIRC, sees the state as the attack dog of capitalism, using its armed force and organization to help keep the proletariat down. A communist state would, of course, not fit this definition.\n\nAlso, it's a little disingenuous to Engels to depict him as just Karl's toady, given that he was a formidable economist and philosopher in his own right.\n\nThe rest of the page is devoted to the Communist Manifesto, and while it's simplified and makes Engels look like kinda bishonen, it's not egregious wrong to my knowledge.\n\n**Page 12**\n\nI'm not going to say much about this page's depiction of Karl Marx being expelled from Germany, then France, then Belgium except to say that I'd really like to read this page in an alternate universe where he moved to New York in the early 1850s.\n\nThere is an issue in the final panel, which claims that Karl Marx invented communism. This is wrong, as I've mentioned above.\n\n**New Badhistory Policy**\n\nYou get the idea. There's a lot wrong, but going through this comic panel by panel will kill me, so I'll just pick out the best bits.\n\nThe Lenin chapter implies that the Bolsheviks masterminded the overthrow of the Tsar in order to seize power from the provisional government. That didn't happen. \n\nThere's great couple of panels showing how the Bolshevik message spreading among soldiers and factory workers, framed in almost purely heroic terms. Like I said, there are some message issues in this comic. The effect is spoiled by someone crying out \"Long live Marx! Long live Lenin!\". In 1917. Karl Marx has been dead 26 years.\n\nThen there's [this](http://i.imgur.com/mtqRM4O.jpg). (What is it with Chicago?)\n\nMost of the stuff is so general there's not much that can be said to be awfully wrong until we get to [the single greatest depiction of the assassination of Leon Trotsky in human history.](http://i.imgur.com/d7GeEPu.png)\n\nFirstly, Trotsky was killed with an ice pick, not a pickaxe. Secondly, Ramon Mercader was clean shaven. Thirdly, a *rainbow-colored poncho and a sombrero?* What is this, *The Three Amigos Join the NKVD*? MERCADER WASN'T EVEN MEXICAN JESUS FUCKING CHRIST.\n\nThe depiction of Stalin is accurate, mostly because he was just that bad, until we get to the bit about the Holodomor, and the most bizarre piece of badhistory I've ever laid eyes on.\n\nYou see, *This Godless Communism*, an anti-communist tract, blames the Holodomor on the peasants burning their own crops and killing their own cows. I don't think I've heard such apologia outside ridiculous tankie echoboxes. \n\nDid we not know much about the Holodomor or something in the sixties? That's the only way I can explain this. \n\nThen it gets into WWII and [this happens.](http://i.imgur.com/W1RhhYH.png)\n\nYup, the artist has used they swastika instead of the iron cross on the turret of the Panzer.\n\nAlso, holy shit, they're describing the Nazi invasion of Ukraine as a liberation. Remember when I said that this comic was a little antisemitic? Well, I'm knocking that up by about 50 centihorstwessels.\n\nOf course, while the Nazis did attempt to leverage Ukrainian nationalism, what they actually did was drive around in their fascist box tanks and murder millions of people. \n\nThis is followed by several pages describing the American war effort and two panels showing the Eastern Front. Not unexpected, just...disappointing.\n\nI'm going to finish here because I don't know much about Khrushchev, and thus can't pretend to accurately critique the last chapter. Also I need a drink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "If you need to catch up, here are [Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3u5qp6/siege_warfare_bad_history_in_cinema_kingdom_of/) and [Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3ujaez/siege_warfare_bad_history_in_cinema_kingdom_of/).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Day 1 continued - It's Not Easy Being A Saracen\n\nWe left our intrepid defenders after Balian had taken care of the ram threatening to break the flimsy gate by burning the thing, which caused Saladin to break off the attack for the day I guess. Or the fight continued until it was dark. Not quite sure what the film was going for here. In reality this stage of the siege was where the casualties started to mount up for the attacking army and the attack would have been called off as it got dark (probably around 6-7PM in the evening). I think the film does a reasonable job of showing the defenders remaining relatively untouched while there are plenty of Saracens biting the dust... usually from 4 metres high after falling from a ladder or wall. As Balian looks over the walls at night, we see at [least one siege tower burning out](http://i.imgur.com/bTakiql.png) and the ground outside the walls is covered in bodies - it was really that skewed for the first three days of fighting and IIRC the number of dead inside the walls was just a dozen or so (wounded is a different story). The shot also gives you a good idea of the interior of a siege tower because they built a few pretty good replicas for this film, and this is one of them going up in flames. Sometimes it makes you wonder how we can spend so much money on basically telling elaborate stories... Each of these babies was 25 tons heavy and mostly wood.\n\n# Day 2 - All Along the Watchtower... Saracens Keep Dying In Droves\n\nThis is where the cool stuff starts. By my counting [this is day 2, but this youtube clip says it's day 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r871wV78q4E). It doesn't really matter since the historical and film days don't match up anyway. We start **day 2**  &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232; with another full frontal assault with siege ladders and more siege towers. \n\nThe siege ladders give us the first bit of bad history of the day - they're way too long. These would have been very vulnerable to being pushed to the side or backwards. In sieges the ladders would have been made on the spot since they needed to be of a specific height to be suitable for scaling that section of wall. Too long and it would be sticking out above the wall making it too easy for the defenders to push it away, or the angle would be too shallow and it would break under the weight of the climbers. Too low... well that one is obvious. Also worth calling out that in addition to the classic \"backwards\" push, they were also pushed sideways. In our clip the things stick a good two metres above the merlons, which is very unhealthy for our ascending soldiers. Especially since [they seem to be climbing all the way to the top](http://i.imgur.com/BaTNTcp.png) (about 16 seconds into the clip) and are looking at a 3-3.5 metre drop to reach the battlements. That's not going to be too healthy for anyone's ankles or knees.\n\nThe right way to do this is to make the ladder just a little bit shorter than the top of the merlon, mount it against it, and then climb through the embrasures to get to the battlements (while fending off the defenders of course). BTW [A clip on the construction of a siege ladder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1GQ0HTRpIk) from the otherwise not that good a series on castles called \"Battle Castle\" with Dan Snow.\n\nThe second piece of bad history is that the defenders wait for the climbers to jump onto the wall from the ladder. In reality the defenders would have had spears or other pole arms to poke at the attacker while he was trying to get off the ladder. There's no better time than at that point. They're in a precarious position, at least one of their hands is busy holding on for dear life to something, and they're trying to find purchase to climb over the crenelations. Meanwhile the defenders can gang up two or three to one on an already disadvantaged attacker they basically only need to unbalance a bit to get rid off. Gravity is a bitch.\n\nFinally for this part, there's one more piece of bad history which is the constant storm of arrows flying all over the screen at any given time. Sure, the defenders would have poured fire on the attackers wherever possible, but the attackers wouldn't continue firing randomly once the first of them had reached the top of the walls. This is not a good idea if you want to keep your own guys alive. Instead they would have concentrated on the towers supporting the wall under attack.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Got Your Flag! Oh shit...**\n\nAt this point in the film [the Saracens manage to scale one of the towers from the battlements](https://youtu.be/r871wV78q4E?t=28). This is something that is supposed to have happened, but I personally think is way too dramatical to have actually happened the way it was written. What happened according to the records was that Balian was negotiating the surrender of the city with Saladin, at which point the Saracen flag was raised on a section of the wall. Saladin was supposed to have said, \"why should I negotiate if I have already taken the city?\" at which point the flag was taken down and the attackers were driven off. Balian then threatened to kill and destroy everything in the city if negotiations weren't possible, and we end up with the city surrendered the way it was. I'm sure the flag bit happened, but it was probably rewritten afterwards to coincide with the negotiations. Mediaeval chroniclers were not above adding a bit of drama to their writings if it suits them, or makes their sponsor look better. It's unlikely for Balian to be out negotiating while the fighting was ongoing.\n\nAnyway onto the bad history parts in the flag raising scene. The only thing here is that the crusaders seem to be defending [Minas Tirith](https://youtu.be/r871wV78q4E?t=31). I don't know how they came up with that look, but whatever is the city in the background, that's not Jerusalem. It's a bit hilly, but nothing really sticks out that high, and that city scape looks completely wrong. It hasn't changed that much over the years, so any modern view of the old city should give you an idea of what it should have looked like.\n\nIt might look that the towers are wrong too, with them being too low compared to the wall, but that's how they were built. Only a few towers on the city wall were full-height towers; by which I mean the type of tower that is more common in castles: much taller than the wall, and forming barriers that stopped anyone from taking more sections of the wall. Most of the city's towers however were a type of flanking open tower that wasn't much higher than the wall itself. Point of interest in regards to the walls: they were taken down in 1219 out of fear that the crusaders would eventually take the city again. They weren't rebuilt until the 16th century, which is the wall that's still visible today. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Siege Towers and Ballistas Don't Mix**\n\nOnce Balian clears the tower we get to [my favourite scene: the Death of the Siege Towers](https://youtu.be/r871wV78q4E?t=74). Both because it's pretty awesome, and there's so much bad history and physics. It's Archimedian in its ingenuity, if Archimedes had accidentally moved the decimal point a few dozen places to the left. Ballistas shoot bolts in the sides of the towers and start pulling them over to the side. The history side of things is pretty quick to cover here: that just didn't happen because it's impossible. As I said above, the replica towers were 25 tons. It would take a bit more to pull those over than a heavy bolt and a rope. Either the bolt would just rip a few planks from the sides, or if it would stick to a heavy support beam, the rope would snap. It would take a bit more effort to bring down a tower like that. But by the gods, it is a glorious sight. [Even Saladin had to smile](https://youtu.be/r871wV78q4E?t=133), despite losing all his big toys in one go and seeing a ton of his soldiers being crushed. \n\nI've already covered some of the realistic ways to deal with those towers, but one particular great one was the story Vitruvius told about probably the largest siege tower in history, [The Helepolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helepolis) (the City Taker). This thing was a War Hammer 40K Titan on wheels, bristling with catapults and ballistas, 40 metres high, covered in iron plates, and weighting around 160 tons. According to Virtruvius's account during the siege of Rhodes:\n\n&gt; By cover of night he had the Rhodians knock a hole through the wall and channel large amounts of water, mud and sewage onto the area where the Helepolis was expected to attack the following day. Diognetus was successful; the tower was brought forth to the anticipated attack position and became irretrievably stuck in the mire. Once the siege was lifted, the Rhodians sold Demetrius' abandoned engines and used the money to erect the enormous Colossus of Rhodes.\n\nThere is another account, but this one is more fun. And it also ties in with using moats and uneven ground to take care of them. They're very top heavy, so any ground that's not flat, smooth, and sturdy enough to carry the weight is going to be a potential risk.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOy gevalt! This is going to take one more episode to finish. It's 2am here and this bit already sits at 10k characters. \\* *Sigh* \\* what have I begun? \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Additional Sources:** \n\n(I found my favourite warfare book back! It had dropped behind some other books and the cleaner found it!) This one is great because it's a collection of writings from Roman and Greek commanders on how to organise all practical aspects of warfare.

        "text": "I'm taking 11th grade World History, and while I like my teacher as a person most of what she teaches us is certifiably untrue:\n\n&gt;Ring Around the Rosie is about the Black Death\n\nThe poem did not exist in print until it was published in Mother Goose in 1881, and the plague explanation did not come until 1961 in the book The Plague and the Fire. [See here](http://www.snopes.com/language/literary/rosie.asp)\n\n&gt;The Russians called Mongols Tartars, a racial slur meaning \"people from hell.\"\n\nTatar, or Tartar as transliterated by Europeans, was the name of the Turkish or Turkic-speaking peoples in Russia and Europe. It was coined by Mongolian nomads and means \"mounted messenger.\" [See here](http://www.britannica.com/topic/Tatar)\n\n&gt;Women in Mongolia were dominant over men, being the head of the house and fighting in wars.\n\nAlthough they had a great deal of rights compared to other women in Asia at the time, the roles of men and women were still rather \"traditional\"; men were the head of the house, fought more in battles and worked in the field while women did housework, patched up the men during battles and except for one occasion did not rule. [See here](http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/westtech/xmongol.htm)\n\nAlso,\n&gt;The only reason the Mongols pillaged villages and raped and stole the women was because they were so highly valued\n\nWhich doesn't make much sense;[The rape and pillaging happened for much more obvious reasons](https://robertod.wordpress.com/2009/08/18/despot-of-the-week-4-genghis-khan/)\n\n&gt;The Mongols did not invade Western Europe because they didn't care to rule over such primitive and backwards people as the Europeans were at the time. \n\n It actually had to do with the terrain of Western Europe, along with the death of Ogedai Khan and the fact that the Mongols simply did not plan to go past Hungary. Source:Ghengis  Khan: Life, Death and Resurrection by John Man.t Hungary. \n\n&gt;The \"Dark Ages\" of Western Europe made intellectual progress stop after the fall of the Roman Empire, and almost all Europeans were destitute and trying to eak out a living in the fields. Cathedrals took hundreds of years to build while there was a mosque that took only a year because Europeans did not have the intellectual or ~~archeological~~ architectural ability to build them.\n\n The \"Dark Ages\" were [largely fabricated](https://mises.org/library/european-miracle) by historians of the Rennaisanse and were not as dark as they were made out to be.\n\n&gt;Europe was under a long period of feudalism during the Middle Ages\n\nIt was a lot more complicated than that. According to Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted by Susan Reynolds, \n&gt;Clearly feudalism was a construct that was developed after the Middle Ages, Brown maintained, and the system it described bore little resemblance to actual medieval society. Its many differing, even contradictory definitions had so muddied the waters that it had lost any useful meaning. The construct was actually interfering with the proper examination of evidence concerning medieval law and society; scholars viewed land agreements and social relationships through the warped lens of the feudalism construct, and either disregarded or dismissed their version of the model.\n\n&gt;\"True Romans\" today still believe Rome originated from Romulus and Remus\n\nThis doesn't even make sense. I can't really argue with it, it's not even wrong. [It's just a myth, a legend,](http://www.ancient.eu/Romulus_and_Remus/) and I'm sure people in Rome understand this.\n\n&gt;The first Christians were Roman Catholic. \n\nTechnically they were Catholic in the sense that Catholic means universal, but[ the apolistic church](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05046a.htm) came first.\n\n\nI'm obviously not a historian, being in high school, so I could be wrong on a few points, but what we're taught kind of annoys me. What is the point of a history class if we aren't learning actual history? Most people in my class don't really think to question what we are taught and will probably go their whole lives under these misconceptions. I wish there was something I could do about it. \n\nEDIT: Architectural, not archeological.\n\n\n",

        "text": "According to [this](https://twitter.com/elle91/status/672100231937400833) tweet (which was retweeted by author @TheDanWells), the children's song \"Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes\" was originally a song meant for leper children to check body parts. \n\nIn case you've forgotten the lyrics, here they are:\n\n    Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes\n    Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes\n    Eyes and ears and mouth and nose\n\nThat's it. Generally there are actions accompanying the song, and sometimes it's sung in rounds or sung multiple times with a word taken away each time, but those are just variations. \n\nFirst thing you'll note is the order in which the song says to check yourself. Head, shoulders, knees, toes, eyes, ears, mouth, nose. I'm not a doctor, but I can say with certainty that leprosy does *not* attack the body by attacking first the head, then the shoulders, then the knees. In fact, it's my understanding that leprosy basically doesn't attack those body parts at *all*. Furthermore, leprosy doesn't actually cause body parts to fall off. \n\nAs for the song itself, it's based on the tune \"Tavern in the Town\". The earliest known sheet music of this was [published in 1883](http://www.fresnostate.edu/folklore/ballads/ShH94.html) and the composer of the song is William H. Hills who released a collection called \"Student Songs\" in 1887 that included the song. \n\nA follow-up comment to the original tweet made an even more startling claim. That claim is that the song \"Where Is Thumbkins\" was also very important (presumably for leprous children to check their fingers). \n\nThis is an even more egregious error. \"Where Is Thumbkins\" is sung to the tune of [Frere Jacques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A8re_Jacques) In English the lyrics have been translated to \"Brother John\" (which is how I learned it as a kid). The English lyrics are:\n\n    Are you sleeping? Are you sleeping?\n    Brother John, Brother John,\n    Morning bells are ringing! Morning bells are ringing!\n    Ding, ding, dong. Ding, ding, dong.\n\nThe lyrics to the song \"Where is Thumbkins\" go like this:\n\n    Where is Thumbkin?\n    Where is Thumbkin?\n    Here I am!\n    Here I am!\n\n    How are you today, sir?\n    Very well, I thank you.\n    Run away.  \n    Run away.\n\n    Where is Pointer?\n    Where is Pointer?\n    Here I am!\n    Here I am!\n\n    How are you today, sir?\n    Very well, I thank you.\n    Run away.  \n    Run away.\n\n    Where is Middleman?\n    Where is Middleman?\n    Here I am!\n    Here I am!\n\n    How are you today, sir?\n    Very well, I thank you.\n    Run away.  \n    Run away.\n\n    Where is Ringman?\n    Where is Ringman?\n    Here I am!\n    Here I am!\n\n    How are you today, sir?\n    Very well, I thank you.\n    Run away.  \n    Run away.\n\n    Where is Pinkie?\n    Where is Pinkie?\n    Here I am!\n    Here I am!\n\n    How are you today, sir?\n    Very well, I thank you.\n    Run away.  \n    Run away.\n\nThese words actually make their first appearance in 1991 on the DVD \"Barney in Concert\" which was a concert performed in March of that year. To be fair, the writers/producers of the Barney show do appear to have based the song (or at least to have gotten the idea for the song) on an older English folk song titled \"Dance Thumbkin Dance\". This song was [first printed](http://www.fresnostate.edu/folklore/ballads/BGMG576.html) in 1831 in Mrs Child's Girls Own Book, and they lyrics to that song are:\n\n    Dance Thumbkin, dance [keep the thumb in motion]\n    Dance ye merrymen every one [All the fingers in motion]\n    For Thumbkin, he can dance alone [keep the thumb in motion] \n    Thumbkin, he can dance alone [keep the thumb in motion]\n    Dance Foreman dance [First finger moving]\n    Dance ye merrymen every one [All fingers moving]\n    But Foreman , he can dance alone [First finger moving]\n    Foreman , he can dance alone [First finger moving]\n\nSame words and actions done with the other fingers, but the 2nd finger is called *Longman*, 3rd finger *Ringman*, and the pinkie *Littleman*. Littleman can not dance alone.\n\nSo no, neither \"Head, shoulders, knees and toes\", nor \"Where is Thumbkins?\" were songs taught to leprous children to help them check their bodies for damaged or missing pieces.

        "text": "Listening to Dan Carlin's Blueprint for Armageddon, I noticed he repeated an apocryphal anecdote, that the assassination of Franz Ferdinand hinged on a sandwich. Weeks ago, I posted this error to /r/dancarlin and emailed info@dancarlin.com. On the whole, I was told it didn't matter.\n\nI was incredulous. Didn't Carlin's introductory thesis depend on this provably false anecdote? I re-listened. And indeed, it did. Not only that, but upon a close listen with a skeptics ear, I realized the introduction is riddled with factual errors. \n\nHere are 7 factual mistakes from the first 20 minutes of Blueprint for Armageddon I. The timecode references the episode you can download from [Carlin's website](http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-50-blueprint-for-armageddon-i/).\n\n**20 Assassins**\n\n&gt; @ 9:59 “On June 28th 1914 Gavrilo Princip and about 20 other guys – this is a true conspiracy – show up in the City of Sarajevo.”\n\n&gt; @ 12:34 “These 20 or so assassins line themselves up along this parade route.”\n\nAccording to Wikipedia and every historian I've read, in Sarajevo, June 28, 1914,there were [six assassins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria) and one ringleader, not 20 or so. \n\n**Everybody Breaks Up**\n\n&gt; @ 13:49 “All the other assassins along the parade route have had their chance spoiled and everybody breaks up and goes their separate ways; the crowd dissipates.”\n\nThis is wrong twice over. Three of the six assassins, Vaso Cubrilovi, Trifko Grabez, and Gavrilo Princip, remained on the Appel Quay. Additionally, the crowd did not dissipate. As the archduke left city hall, “the crowds broke into loud cheers,” and, according to Princip, “there were too many people for comfort on the Quay” (Remak, Joachim. Sarajevo: The Story of a Political Murder. New York: Criterion, 1959. P. 135-136)\n\n**Local Magistrate’s Residence**\n\n&gt; @ 14:04 “The archduke goes to the, you know, local magistrate’s residence to, you know, lodge a complaint!”\n\nThe archduke went to Sarajevo’s city hall, not a residence. A luncheon at Governor Potiorek’s official residence was scheduled, but as Ferdinand was murdered, he couldn’t make it. Also, though Carlin infers Ferdinand went to lodge a complaint, he in fact proceeded with the planned itinerary; both the mayor and the archduke gave their scheduled speeches.\n\n**Extra Security &amp; Franz Harrach**\n\n&gt; @ 14:44 “The local authorities are worried as you might imagine so they give him some extra security including one guy … Franz Harrach.”\n\nTwo parts of this statement are factually incorrect. One, the local authorities denied extra security. Ferdinand’s chamberlain, Baron Rumerskirch, proposed troops line the city streets. Governor Potiorek denied the request as the soldiers didn’t have proper uniforms. Rumerskirch then suggested police clear the streets. Potiorek denied that as well. Two, Count Harrach wasn’t “extra security” — Count Harrach’s was in the car before and after the first assassination attempt (King, Greg, and Sue Woolmans. The Assassination of the Archduke: Sarajevo 1914 and the Romance That Changed the World. [P. 204 - 205](https://books.google.com/books?id=GaxpFpsI9kUC&amp;lpg=PT253&amp;ots=3C-NTIdZbl&amp;dq=Rumerskirch%20troops&amp;pg=PT254#v=onepage). ).\n\n**Unpublished Route**\n\n&gt; @ 14:59 “And they speed off for the hospital. Now, no one knows where the archduke is going, now none of the people would be assassins or anything this isn’t a published route nobody knows the archduke is heading in this direction.”\n\nIn fact, Ferdinand never went off the published route; Princip murdered Ferdinand before he made a turn onto the new route. Meanwhile, Princip remained where he was supposed to be stationed, at the Latin Bridge. [Here](http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-footprints-of-gavrilo-princip-in-sarajevo-marking-the-news-photo/76312228), you can see the footprints from where he fired, the intersection where Ferdinand was murdered, and the Latin Bridge adjacent.\n\n**The Sandwich**\n\n&gt; @ 15:01 “Meanwhile Princip has gone to get a sandwich.”\n\n&gt; @ 15:49 “Out of the restaurant where he had gone to get that I guess you could say consolation sandwich to make him feel a bit better about how his bad day had been…”\n\nCarlin even begins with an invented analogy.\n&gt; @ 9:04 “Assuming Lee Harvey Oswald did kill President Kennedy, what if someone showed up right when he had the rifle … screwed up the whole assassination attempt … Oswald storms out of the Texas Book Depository angry that his well laid plans have been destroyed and he goes across town to his favorite restaurant and he goes to gets himself a bite to eat when he’s coming out of the restaurant … right in front of him within five or six feet stopped below him is John F Kennedy’s car.”\n\nCarlin loves the serendipity, that history turned on a sandwich. However, there is no evidence Princip ever went anywhere to eat anything. The sandwich anecdote was first published 1998, in a work of fiction ([Smithsonian.com](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gavrilo-princips-sandwich-79480741/)).\n\n**Immortalized Now**\n\n&gt; @ 19:27 “As a way to sort of prove that the old adage that one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter is true, the spot where Princip was standing when he fired those fatal shots are immortalized now in the city of Sarajevo with a plaque and the actual footsteps in metal on the ground where the spot was.”\n\nThe footprints are not immortalized now. They were destroyed in the Siege of Sarajevo about 20 years ago. They were not recreated because in Bosnia [Princip’s legacy is controversial](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/11/us-bosnia-wwi-princip-idUSBREA2A08U20140311). Also, the footprints were [made of concrete](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gavrilo_Princip_steps_and_plaque.jpg), not metal.\n\n**Additional Errors** \n\nThere are sloppy quotes, dubious assertions and more factual errors throughout Blueprint for Armageddon. \n\nI sent Carlin an email listing errors, and I was told \"Dan's record for accuracy is quite good\" and \"Corrections to the audio after release aren't possible.\" I replied that corrections are possible, and haven't heard anything back for a couple weeks. \n\nFor lack of a better alternative, I'll post additional errors here and on my [personal web site](https://spnzr.com/tag/dan-carlin/).

[BuzzFeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/natemcdermott/all-about-the-benjamins#.poBVGxNdq) has found multiple examples of Ben Carson telling a story about how the constitutional convention was on the verge of collapse whe, divinely inspired, Benjamin Franklin tells everyone to get on their knees and pray. They do, and waddaya know, praying fixed everything and they made the best dang document the world has ever seen. In one of the videos, Carson says as follows:\n\n&gt;Read about the continental congress; when the small states and the large states had very different views about how this union should be put together, and the whole thing was about to split apart and Benjamin Franklin, the elder statesman, stood up in front of the assembly and said ‘Gentlemen! Stop! Let’s get down on our knees, and let’s seek wisdom from God,.’ and they all stopped and they prayed and when they got up they got it together and they put together a constitution which is the best one ever seen in the history of the world\n\nNow, in Carson's defense, something kind of like that almost happened. Maybe.\n\nThis [link](http://candst.tripod.com/franklin.htm) is pretty thorough and gives examples from James Madison and others noting that Franklin did indeed call for a prayer. Madison recorded Franklin as saying this:\n\n&gt;I therefore beg leave to move-that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that one or more of the Clergy of this City be requested to officiate in that Service\n\nRichard B. Bernstein, a lecturer in political science at City College in New York who has written several books on the Founding Fathers, said this is where Carson deviates from history:\n\n&gt;This is the truth of the story: Franklin said, ‘yeah we all gotta pray, they said we gotta get a clergyman from outside, but if they got clergyman outside everyone would know. So everyone was uncomfortable with the idea and it never came to pass.\n\nMost damning though, is this fact check from Franklin himself, who wrote in his own diary of the proposal:\n\n&gt;The Convention except three or four Persons, thought Prayers unnecessary\n\nNeedless to say, the constitution wound up being written without the prayer.\n",

        "text": "Morning! I recently watched the 'film' Gettysburg, and want to share with you some interesting points it gets terribly and completely wrong. The film was released in 1993, and is over four hours long! It was originally going to be released for television, but was instead pushed to cinemas and then VCRs. It is based on the novel Killer Angels, which I haven't read. \n\n**Part 0: Opinions on the film in general**\n\nIts not that bad of a film if you can look past it hating history. And by that, I mean it gets all the motivations wrong for everybody, but the events that unfold are accurate enough. It takes place during the 3 days at Gettysburg, and splits screen time between Confederates and the Union. It follows John Buford as he claims the high ground for the Union day 1, then Joshua Chamberlain at Little Round Top, and finally Pickett's Charge with Longstreet. The battle scenes give a sense of the scale of the war, and how long they were. There isn't any Patriot \"lol look at them in lines\" sort of thing, and while my exact knowledge of Civil War battle strategy isn't amazing, it looks good enough. It helps that the film was shot at *the* Gettysburg for most of it too. It doesn't slog around too much, and you could watch it in 2 afternoons and be entertained.\n\nWell, now let me tell you why this movie is kinda smeared in shit.\n\n**Part 1: Union Motivations**\n\nOkay, this is the most pendact/weakest part of my critique, but hang with me. In this four hour epic, much time is split between Confederates and Union, along with Battle and Rest. Every night, there are plenty of scenes with soldiers talking about random stuff/why they are here. What I am getting at is, the director of the movie had a lot of chances to not make this mistake. \n\nThis mistake being how it presents Union's Motivations for the war. The only character who speaks of their motivations for fighting on the union side is Colonel Chamberlain. He has this opportunity when he is trying to convince some Maine Mutineers/Deserters to continue to fight once more. He stands in front of this group of soldiers and states:\n\n&gt; But we are here for something new, this has not happened much, in the history of the world. We are an army out to set other men free. America should be free ground, all of it, not divided by a line between slave states and free - all the way from here to the Pacific Ocean. No man has to bow. No man born to royalty. Here we judge you by what you do, not by who your father was. Here you can be something. Here is the place to build a home. But it's not the land, there's always more land. It's the idea that we all have value - you and me. What we are fighting for, in the end, we're fighting for each other.\n\nLater, Chamberlain was questioned by a South POW on why he was fighting:\n\n&gt; To free the slaves, of course. And preserve the Union.\n\nChamberlain clearly has his priorities in order. After doing some bit of research on my end, I can't find anything of the real Col. Chamberlain being an Abolitionist. I see many quotes of him wanting the reunification however, as example:\n\n&gt; \"I fear, this war, so costly of blood and treasure, will not cease until men of the North are willing to leave good positions, and sacrifice the dearest personal interests, to rescue our country from desolation, and defend the national existence against treachery.\"\n\nNow the movie is entirely able to paint someone as an abolitionist for whatever its purpose, but because Chamberlain is the only Union soldier who is offering his views for fighting, and uses his views to convince other soldiers to fight, it presents an improper image. Truth is, **White Union Soldiers were fighting for Union first, and maybe emancipation second, maybe**. The vast majority of Union Soldiers saw the Emancipation Proclamation as tool to help destroy the south, and thought nothing else of it. Some soldiers hated the Proclamation, some loved it, but the vast majority just had a basic opinion of it, and then continued fighting for the Union. In its four hours, Gettysburg presents all Union soldiers as soldiers fighting to free black men, while in real life union soldiers were fighting for reunification (or because they were drafted). \n\nInstead of showing this wide range of motivations, the film Gettysburg shows how the Union soldiers were all abolitionists.\n\n**Part 2: Confederate Motivations**\n\nOkay, this is juicier. Remember that confederate POW from earlier? Well Chamberlain asked him why was he fighting and he gave us this great bit:\n\n&gt; Confederate prisoner: I don't know about other folk, but I ain't fighting for no darkies one way or the other. I'm fightin' for my rights. All of us here, that's what we're fighting for.\n\n&gt; Lieutenant Thomas D. Chamberlain: Your what?\n\n&gt; Confederate prisoner: For our rights. The right to live my life like I see fit. Why can't you just live the way you want to live, and let us live the way we do? Live and let live, I hear some folks say. Be lot less fuss and bother if more folks took it to heart.\n\nAnd other one:\n\n&gt; James L. Kemper: No, no, no, no. Now-now, we-we established this country in the first place with very strong state governments just for that very reason. I mean, uh... let me put it to you this way: my home is in Virginia. The government of my home *is* home. Virginia would not allow itself to be ruled by... by some, uh, king over there in London. And it's not about to let itself be ruled by some president in Washington! Virginia, by God, sir, is gonna be run by *Virginians*!\n\nand a third\n\n&gt; Major General George E. Pickett: Colonel, think on it, now. Now you suppose that we all join a club, a gentlemen's club. And then, well, after a time, several of the members began to, uh... began to *intrude* themselves into our private lives, our home lives. Began tellin' us what we could do, what we couldn't do. Well, then, wouldn't any one of us have the right to resign? I mean, just...\n[he snaps his fingers]\n\n&gt; Major General George E. Pickett: ... resign. Well, that's what we did. That's what *I* did, and now these people are tellin' us that we don't have that right to resign.\n\nThis is the only view on secession presented in this four hour movie. The \"Oh my god, they don't let us live the way we want to live\" Slavery is literally mentioned twice by confederates, and both times are dismissing it. Not to mention the whole analogy is bonkers. The north had been bending over backwards for the south, with the Fugitive Slave Act and allowing the government to spend millions on recapturing one escaped slave. The people of America voiced their opinion on who should lead it, and the south, who still had great control in congress and the Judicial Branch, didn't like it. Also, nothing was said that came close to quotes such as this by Judge Harris who went to state conventions to convince them to secceed. \n\n&gt; \"Our fathers made this a government for the white man, rejecting the negro, as an ignorant, inferior, barbarian race, incapable of self-government, and not, therefore, entitled to be associated with the white man upon terms of civil, political, or social equality.\" \n\nI understand that confederate soldiers wouldn't be talking about slaves all the damn time, but when you're fighting a war to preserve it, then it should be mentioned as a reason to hate the damn yanks at least fucking once! Without further ado, I give you the greatest quote this film has to offer:\n\n&gt; **Lieutenant General James Longstreet: We should have freed the slaves, THEN fired on Fort Sumter.**\n\nWhile Longstreet wasn't a direct practicer of slavery, THIS QUOTE IS BATSHIT INSANE. It is important to understand ALL white people in the south benefited from slavery. The poorest white man could still boss around a black man any time he wanted. It gave a sense of importance to one's self identity to be above the majority of the population in your state without even trying. SO IGNORING THAT THE SOUTH WAS FIGHTING TO KEEP SLAVERY FROM THEIR PERCEIVED THREAT OF A REPUBLICAN TAKING OFFICE, NO FUCKING SOUTHERN MAN WOULD RESPECT LONGSTREET IF HE SAID THIS. THIS IS JUST DISTANCING THE CONFEDERACY FROM SLAVERY.\n\nSERIOUSLY WTF.\n\n**Part 3: Evolution**\n\nNow I am going to take some of your precious time to talk about evolution. Wow, this is out of left field isn't it? Yup. A bit off topic? Yup. Unnecessary when you talking about the civil war? Yup. Wasting time and space in an already long ass report? Exactly. What I am getting at here, is that I am still fucking pissed at the director/writers for putting a 3 minute scene in a 4 hour movie that does jack all.\n\n [enjoy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFc3DDTPXXo). \n\nI hate this scene\n\n**Part 4: Vickswho?**\n\nThe final thing I have to add is the importance of Gettysburg. In our modern teaching, we continue to say that Gettysburg was the turning point of the war. The film reflects this as pretty much every guy with a mustache says something like this:\n\n&gt; ~Oh god I think we should win this battle or we will lose the war~ \n\nYou could making a drinking game for every time somebody assumes this battle in the middle of fucking nowhere is the turning point. It's classic revisionism and is there to create drama. Not a lot of people know this, but the biggest victory of July was *arguable* Vicksburg. Vicksburg was the last hold out on the Mississippi River, and had stubbornly refused to fall under siege for months. By taking this hold out, the Western theatre was allowed to push east and destroy the Southern homefront.  Now I am not saying that Vicksburg was the turning point, as Prof. Gallagher might come and kill me in my sleep. You know what, I'll just link to this pretty interesting interview with [him](http://chqdaily.com/2013/07/10/gallagher-gettysburg-vicksburg-are-flashy-but-clearly-not-civil-wars-turning-points/).\n\n**Part 5: Conclusion**\n\nCool battle scenes powered by Lost Causism and fucking random ass evolution scenes.

        "text": "The many-headed Hydra is back, this time in the form of [a video homage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEYh5WACqEk) to *Guns, Germs, and Steel* courtesy of CGPGrey and Audible. At the end of the video CGPGrey calls *GG&amp;S* “the history book to rule all history books”. He cites Diamond’s work extensively and, with the aid of fun graphics, tries to explain the apparent one-way transfer of infectious disease after contact. The ideas presented in the video are not new, they were outlined in *GG&amp;S* almost twenty years ago, and Diamond borrowed extensively from Alfred Crosby’s 1986 *Ecological Imperialism* for his central thesis. Check out an [earlier post for more links to previous discussions](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3uj3mo/inaccuracies_of_grey_90_mortality_from_a_passive/). \n\nIf *GG&amp;S* is the history book to rule them all then, like Tolkien’s One Ring, *GG&amp;S* is an attractive but fundamentally corruptive influence. Here I’ll briefly explain several of the issues while focusing on one key assumption of the video: the New World was a disease-free paradise. \n\n**A Virgin Population and a Disease Free Paradise**\n\nI’m going to quote from [this recent post](https://np.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/comments/3syg36/native_genocide_the_war_continues/cx1h8zz) to explain several aspects of the disease transfer issues. The domestic origins/”virgin soil” hypothesis, with the corresponding catastrophic population decline in the Americas, relies on several assumptions. Here I will briefly discuss the notion of a disease free paradise, the application of a *post hoc* fallacy, and the tendency to divorce the impact of disease from other aspects of colonialism.\n\n*Post hoc ergo propter hoc*\n\nThe discussion of Native American population trends after contact is plagued by a prevalent *post hoc ergo propter hoc* fallacy. Earlier historians assumed archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence of population dispersal in the protohistoric period was caused by introduced pathogens. The common perspective held if a site was abandoned after Europeans arrived, it must have been abandoned due to disease. Similarly, historians read de Soto’s retelling of the Plague of Cofitachequi and assumed the population perished from introduced infections. Other historians read colonial accounts of Native American dispersal due to disease, and value those written sources more highly than ethnohistorical accounts placing the blame on warfare and territorial displacement. For example, consider a 1782 address by Cherokee Chiefs to the commissioners of the United States…\n\n&gt; Look back and recollect what a numerous and warlike people we were, when our assistance [was] asked against the French on the Ohio- we took pity on you then, and assisted you. We have been continually since, decreasing, and are now become weak. What are the causes? War, and succeeding invasions of our country.\n\nIn the past 20 years, however, the field is stepping back from the assumption of infectious disease spread without concrete evidence of epidemics. We are looking at the protohistoric period in the context of greater processes occurring in the decades and centuries leading up to contact. What we see is the continuation of population stasis, or dispersal, or aggregation that typified the centuries leading up to contact. This pattern, not the completely novel system we might expect with catastrophic disease loss, describes the centuries after contact. In North America the long view shows a vibrant population continuing to change and adapt as they had before, not one reeling from catastrophic waves of disease advancing ahead of early *entradas*.\n\n*A Disease Free Paradise*\n\nThe death by disease alone narrative relies on an outdated perception of the Americas as a disease-free paradise. We know populations in the Americas were subject to a wide variety of intestinal parasites, Chagas, pinta, bejel, tick-borne pathogens like Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, syphilis, tuberculosis, and all manner of zoonotic pathogens. [Two of the most devastating epidemics to hit the Valley of Mexico after contact were the result of cocoliztli, a hemorrhagic virus believed to be native to the New World](http://www.medigraphic.com/pdfs/revbio/bio-2002/bio024h.pdf). According to Francisco Hernandez, the Proto-Medico of New Spain and former personal physician of King Phillip II, the 1576 epidemic caused headaches, high fever, black tongues, dark urine, severe abdominal and thoracic pain, and profuse bleeding from the nose, eyes, and mouth. These symptoms are not consistent with any of the European or African diseases introduced to Mexico in the 16th century. Cocoliztli spread widely and quickly, with death occurring in 3-4 days from onset of initial symptoms. In addition to the devastating 1545 and 1576 epidemics, ten lesser cocoliztli epidemics flared up in the century after contact, striking in 1559, 1566, 1587, 1592, 1601, 1604, 1606, 1613, 1624, and 1642.\n\nCocoliztli alone defied Grey’s position of a disease free New World, and the journey of syphilis likewise supports a more nuanced view of disease exchange. Though the history of syphilis is often disputed, current research suggests a New World origin for the pathogen that burned its way through Europe in the wake of contact ([Harper et al., 2011](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21613/full); [Tampa et al., 2014](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3956094/)). We are constantly making new discoveries about Native American health in the New World. Just this year at a national anthropological conference researchers presented new skeletal evidence of the antiquity of syphilis in Western Mexico. Bioarchaeologists routinely find evidence of infection on New World skeletal remains before contact. For example, at the Larsen site 26% of foragers and 84% of sedentary agriculturalists show skeletal evidence of bacterial infection. At the Toqua site 77% of infants had periosteal reactions indicating bacterial infections ([Kelton, 2007](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2463511.Epidemics_and_Enslavement?from_search=true&amp;search_version=service). While Grey and Diamond advocate the Old World exceptionalism of circulating childhood diseases, the rate of bacterial infections among the youngest members of this cemetery sample suggests New World infants were not free from childhood afflictions.   \n\nPlaying host to any number of parasites, viruses, bacteria, fungi, and ectoparasites is the natural state of all animals, including humans. We make tasty hosts. The bioarchaeological, genetic, and historical evidence shows copious evidence of disease afflicting inhabitants of the New World. While some pathogens didn’t make the journey from Asia, &gt;15,000 years is sufficient time for novel New World diseases to jump to a new primate host. The balance of evidence suggests humans in the New World, like humans everywhere since the origin of our species, encountered infectious agents, and gained immunity or died in the processes or lived with their chronic infections. The evidence also suggests the existence of at least two home-grown plagues, contrary to the claims of the video, and one America-pox that followed *conquistadores* home.\n\nAs an aside, the myth of a virgin populace also holds that Amerindians lacked both the adaptive immunity and immunological genetic variation needed to ward off novel pathogens. One commonly cited reason for Native American susceptibility to disease after contact is the lack of genetic diversity in immunologically important loci, specifically [HLA alleles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen). In the past it was hypothesized this decreased variability could decrease immune response, or allow for a specific pathogen to spread through the homogeneous population with more disastrous results. This remains a theoretical hypothesis, strongly influenced by the past dominance of the narrative of death by disease alone, and never proven. Like [the elevated mortality seen in modern refugee populations](http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~dludden/RefugeePublicHealth.pdf), we have far more evidence for the toxic effect colonialism on host health than we do for an inherit weakness in Native American immune defense. Native Americans were not immunologically naïve Bubble Boys, they responded like any human population to smallpox, or measles, or influenza. What did influence the impact of disease, though, was the larger health context and the influence of colonial endeavors.\n\nThe focus on disease alone divorces infectious organisms from the greater context of colonialism. We must remember not only on the pathogens, but the changes in host biology and the greater ecological setting eventually allowed for those pathogens to spread into the interior of the continent. Warfare and slaving raids added to excess mortality, while simultaneously displacing populations from their stable food supply, and forcing refugees into crowded settlements where disease could spread among weakened hosts. Later reservations restricted access to foraged foods and exacerbated resource scarcity where disease could follow quickly on the heels of famine. Workers in missions, *encomiendas*, and other forms of forced labor depended on a poor diet, while simultaneously meeting the demands of harsh production quotas that taxed host health before diseases even arrived. \n\nHuman are demographically capable of rebounding after population crashes provided other sources of excess mortality are limited. The greater cocktail of colonial insults, not just the pathogens themselves, decreased population size and prevented rapid recovery after contact. A myopic focus on disease alone ignores the complex factors influencing Native American demography. For added insight into how the combination of warfare, slaving raids, territorial displacement, and resource scarcity all worked together to decrease host immunity as well as spread pathogens check out this case study [on the US Southeast during the protohistoric](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2h32c8/did_the_columbian_exchange_put_native_american/ckpewu8).\n\n**Why didn’t Europeans get sick?**\n\nThe question was asked in the video, and the viewer is left to assume Europeans did not fall ill in the New World, or at least that there was no America-pox to spread to the Old. Like the popular perception of history, the video fails to acknowledge that Europeans died in droves in the New World, and in many cases those deaths might have been from diseases native to the Americas.\n\nWhen we read the accounts of early Spanish *entradas* in North America, the authors make specific mention of crew members becoming ill weeks after their arrival. Nutritional and physiological stress from poorly planned colonization attempts decreased their immune defense, leaving them vulnerable to all manner of illnesses. Ayllón's 1526 attempt to establish a settlement on the Santee River in South Carolina ended in disaster. Of the original 600 colonists, all but 150 died from exposure, malnutrition, and disease. Later, the 1528 Narváez entrada likewise suffered a series of unfortunate events in their attempts to find riches in Florida. 400 men landed in Tampa Bay, yet only four survived the trip to Florida. After a month of raiding Apalachee towns, members of the entrada began to sicken and Cabeza de Vaca says\n\n&gt; there were not horses enough to carry the sick, who went on increasing in numbers day by day... the people were unable to move forward, the greater part being ill.\n\nThe sickness began only after Narvàez reached the population center at Aute, and struck those who stayed in the village, while sparing the party exploring the coast (Kelton, 2007). \n\nSimilarly, chroniclers of de Soto’s expedition make no mention of sickness among their number during their voyage to the mainland, nor in the first few months wintering near the Apalachicola River. In May of 1540, a full year after making landfall in Florida, the first illnesses are mentioned among members of the *entrada*. In the Appalachian highlands near the native town of Xualla many Spaniards became “sick and lame”. Further illnesses struck near Guaxule where Spaniards were sick with fever and wandered from the trail. By autumn of 1540, 102 members of the *entrada* perished from disease and warfare. Deaths from disease seemed to abate for two years until the *entrada* reached the shores of the Mississippi River. There, de Soto, a man who survived the invasion of Peru and more than two years of pillaging through the U.S. Southeast, was “badly racked by fever”. He died seven days later (Kelton, 2007).\n\nDid members of the Ayllón, Narváez, and de Soto *entradas* perish from New World pathogens, or did they bring their own microbes with them, and perish as a result? We don't know for sure. The deaths began outside the incubation period for many common acute infections, giving us reason to suspect they did not bring those illnesses with them from the Caribbean, but rather encountered them in North America. \n\nSimilar European mortality events are noted in Jamestown, where of the &gt; 3,500 who arrived from 1617-1622, only 1,240 were alive in 1622. The chief cause of death was endemic illness, and the term \"seasoning\" was commonly used to describe the disease transition new immigrants needed to endure before their survival in the New World was assured. In the past, the perception of the disease-free New World led to the assumption that seasoning illnesses were solely Old World imports. Given the growing evidence of disease in the Americas, we must consider the possibility that some seasoning pathogens spread from their neighbors in *Tsenacommacah* (“densely inhabited land”). As we dive into the primary sources we find abundant evidence of European mortality due to disease, but it will always be a little difficult to determine, with 100% certainty, that those illnesses afflicting Europeans were from Old World pathogens alone.\n\n**Wrapping Up**\n\nThere is much more to cover, but I fear work may prevent me from writing further posts. I re-emphasize there are shelves of books, and reams of articles, about the wonderful complexity of Native American, European, and African interactions after contact. *Guns, Germs, and Steel* is not the history book to rule all history books. It may be a place to start, but if it is your one source please consider further reading.\n\n**Suggested Reading**\n\nCameron, Kelton, and Swedlund, eds. *Beyond Germs: Native Depopulation in North America*\n\nCalloway *One Vast Winter Count: The Native American West before Lewis and Clark*\n\nGallay *The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South, 1670-1717*\n\nKelton *Epidemics and Enslavement: Biological Catastrophe in the Native Southeast, 1492-1715*\n\nRestall *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest*",

        "author": "Dirish",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3ujaez/siege_warfare_bad_history_in_cinema_kingdom_of/",
        "text": "( [for part 1 - check here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3u5qp6/siege_warfare_bad_history_in_cinema_kingdom_of/) ). We're picking up this review after an all night bombardment with trebuchets and catapults which never happened, and continue in what in the film is day 2.  \n\n# The Army Begins to Move Forward\n\nWe see the whole army slowly make its way towards the wall and I can see around 6 siege towers being pushed towards the wall. The army pauses and pulls out Guy de Lusignan in his underwear sitting backwards on a donkey, wearing a tall dunce hat of sorts. In reality Guy was treated rather well and was at this time in Damascus as a prisoner in comfortable quarters. He would be released in 1188 after Sibylla's multiple requests to Saladin and later bought Cyprus from the Templars, where he died in 1194. So as much as the film tries to portrait Saladin as a merciful opponent in other scenes (which he was), for reasons unknown, it abandons that portrayal here for no logical reason.\n\nAfter that little interlude, the bombardment continues (which didn't happen - see part 1) and the siege towers make their way towards the walls. I'll stop here for a short interlude to point out one good thing: the walls barely show any damage from the overnight bombardment. That's pretty accurate; even with heavy siege engines it could take a long time to destroy a section of wall. Far, far longer than portrayed in pretty much any film because no one wants to sit around and watch a week long bombardment chip away at a wall. They could take a little bit longer than a single shot every once in a while though... \n\nI'm also using this to cover a few quick-fire pieces of bad history:\n\n1.  Six siege towers is insane. Like all the other siege equipment in this film, the number of these is exaggerated as well. You can easily imagine how unstable, slow, and prone to breakdowns these were just by looking at them, so like the trebuchets these were mostly build on site. Moving them around too much would have either toppled them over somewhere, lead to regular stops to fix broken axles and wheels, and any down- or uphill section on the road would have presented a whole rake of additional problems. Building six of these would have taken a massive amount of wood, hides, and other materials and it's very unlikely to impossible that they would have been ready after arriving just the evening before. As you could see in part one, Saladin had been crazy busy taking crusader possessions all along the coast. He wouldn't have had time to wait for a siege train to catch up with him each time. To put this in perspective: In 1099 the crusaders managed to build two by taking apart two Genoese ships and transporting the wood overland from Jaffa to Jerusalem. \n2. There is no mention of siege towers being used at all in this siege in any of the records.\n3. In the approach there's a hinged counterweight trebuchet (see part one for the demo videos) visible [on wheels](http://i.imgur.com/71WkWvX.png). That's not a good idea. If you have an unhinged counterweight, the movement that the wheels allow will absorb the energy of the release and reduce the strain on the frame, while also increasing the range. On a hinged counterweight it's counter-productive and will induce wild swinging motions of the arm and frame which will reduce the life of the machine considerably. \n4. The catapults and trebuchets are moving forward with the army. Why? They'd obviously proven the night before that they were within range of the walls, so why expose them to more danger by moving them forward while firing? It ruins your accuracy, it also moves you away from your ammo (not quite sure how they sorted that one out, the film shows a pile of boulders with each trebuchet, but nothing that would allow them to move them with the engine), and it brings you in range of the defenders. Once a siege engine was set up, it wouldn't be moved unless it was necessary to hit a different section of the defences.\n5. The siege towers shown are [open at the bottom](http://i.imgur.com/12fLtPB.png). I'm not sure who thought that was a good idea, but that's basically a big sign saying \"start fire here for maximum effect please\". The hides above it are supposed to be soaked in vinegar to stop fire from taking hold, so leaving any gaps there is a very bad idea. What some towers had was a hinged door here that would open up near the wall to allow a ram to do its work while the defenders were distracted, but nothing like this.\n6. Jerusalem's siege weaponry arsenal was non-existent. The city most certainly didn't have trebuchets as show in [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/en7Cm7c.png).\n7. One other piece of bad history is how the city is shown to have two walls. That's not true either as you can see on the city maps I posted in part one. There are a few areas that have additional defences like the citadel and alongside the temple mount, but the city never had two walls surrounding it at any time in its history as far as I know. In Roman times the city was split into three sections, and the Roman army had to take each of those in turn, but each section only had single walls. \n\n# Closer to the walls\n\nWe return to your regular scheduled program as Saladin's army reaches the 300 range when the little mangonels in the city have their moment of glory. If Jerusalem had any siege artillery, this is probably the biggest they would have had. There's one piece of continuity error here, which isn't so much bad history: [one of the siege towers shows itself covered in arrows](http://i.imgur.com/SCldbAl.png), but Balian hasn't yet given the command to the archers to fire, and they're not yet in range of the archers.\n\nAt range 150 we finally see the defenders that most likely formed the only missile defence force: the archers and crossbowmen. It's good to see that these archers are sensible and remain behind the walls. I don't see any casualties from enemy fire here, so kudos for showing how much of an advantage a wall did really give you as a defender. In the records of the siege the casualties in the city were reportedly very low in the first four days of the siege. Far lower than the film shows, while the attacking force suffered heavy casualties in their attempts to take the wall. \n\nWorth nothing is that the film leaves out the most effective defensive measure Balian had at his disposal: heavy cavalry sorties. In reality he used them frequently in the first four days with massive success. It might seem suicidal given the size differences of the armies, but the knight-based heavy cavalry was the main advantage the Crusaders had. Time and time again we see battles being decided by these guys and winning the day against sometimes overwhelming odds. With the army being so close to the walls, they could be used with devastating effect: strike fast and then retreat back with ease. Saladin's move to the northern wall was mainly to avoid these sorties from ruining the siege engines that he used in the later part of the siege. There were less gates there and the distance to his camp was further, which gave the attacking army more time to prepare. In that second stage of the siege, the sorties do indeed become less effective and the last one even fails altogether. \n\nThis is often a part overlooked in sieges, the defenders would rarely just sit behind their walls. Raids to break blockades, or destroy supplies or siege equipment were quite common. Talking about knights, one little side note I'd like to add about our socialist and egalitarian Balian, while he did knight a bunch of people, they were all sons of nobles. Basically they all received an early promotion to knighthood. He didn't go around promoting Mr. Mucky the Commoner, although a few fighters might have received a battlefield promotion if they were very good. I'd have promoted the shit out of Almaric for example, just like Balian did in the film.\n\n# Touchdown\n\nOnce the siege towers touch the walls, there's a nice touch of how you'd deal with the damned things in reality: [burn them](http://i.imgur.com/oX1EzCF.jpg). Clay pots with flammables were tossed into the towers, setting fire to the attackers and the exposed inner parts that weren't covered in (mostly) fire-proof hides. If the sorties would have been shown, those towers would have been the main goals of them. Take out any slow moving, or immobile siege equipment is basically target number one for any sortie. In that regard AoE II is pretty accurate -&gt; melee cavalry makes short work of siege engines. Imagine those fire pots being thrown at the exposed back of the tower and you can see why. I do need to add this obligatory \"[Balian is so cool, he walks away from fire](http://i.imgur.com/zm7fjiu.png)\" shot.\n\n[The ram](http://i.imgur.com/vsmHmsx.png) looks pretty good. Perhaps a bit too narrow for something that needs to batter down the gates of a main city, but it's covered in hides and functional. There's a weird thing going on with [the portcullis which suddenly disappears and reappears between two shots](http://i.imgur.com/TIVosfv.png), but that's more continuity again than bad history. It looks like they made the thing, but never lowered it. The ram does however perform amazingly against the gate, like so often in films. Within three strikes we can already see sections of the inner door splintering and the braces are starting to show cracks. Like in the Robin Hood film, the door is a single layer of wood with some cross-bracing. Grrr, bad director hates doors. Luckily Balian and Co are on hand to take care of the magic ram in a historical accurate way: burn the damned thing. Nothing says \"stop knocking at the door\" like a bath of flammable liquids. They even seem to have murder holes this time, and use them to coat the thing in a nice thick layer of pitch (I think) to prepare it, and then burn it with the flame pots. Perfect!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**To be continued**\n\nI see that I'm going to need at least a part 3 to close this off. Man, there's so much more wrong with this siege than I originally thought when I watched it. Apart of course from hardly anything matching up with the historical \"how it really happened\" narrative, I hadn't realised how many more liberties were taken with... well... everything really. Hopefully I'll post another one on Sunday - it really depends on how shitty the weather will be this weekend.\n\n**Bonus bad history:** (it's like a Marvel movie, don't leave until the end of the credits!)\n\nThe discussion in part one uncovered a few more pieces of bad history that I'll copy below. \n\n** *The location of the crucifixion is incorrect - or the local mess with Balian and send him on a wild goose chase:* ** \n\nBalian going outside the city to climb a hill to visit the place where Jesus was thought to have been crucified would be bad history. Or locals playing pranks on tourists.\nThe generally accepted location for the place of the crucifixion is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre , a site completely within the city walls then as well as now and currently in the Christian Quarter of the Old City. The first incarnation of the church was build in 325 by Constantine the Great after his mother Helena identified the spot as Golgotha, discovered the True Cross, and Jesus' grave.\nSo Balian would only have had a relatively short walk through the two main streets to visit the Church. Unless of course the native misunderstood him and send him on his merry way to the Mount of Olives to the main Jewish graveyard that was there.\nBTW once Balian climbs to the top of the hill the film shows the city in the background (CG I assume) and the views from there are still too flat and dry. There are big ridges around pretty much all sides of the city. I'm having trouble figuring out what gate he took first into the city because there's quite a few things different about the architecture, so I can't really figure out where it is supposed to be. For example the city view from the hill doesn't show the Dome of the Rock, even though it's visible in earlier shots. The walls look fairly unrecognisable as well, so they're no help either in identifying the spot he's supposed to be, but the Mount of Olives is covered in churches, so it's the most likely place.\n\n** *How movable are trebuchets?* **\n\n[EquinoxActual pointed out this](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3u5qp6/siege_warfare_bad_history_in_cinema_kingdom_of/cxce1al):\n\n&gt; Now I'm saying this as a re-enactor rather than a historian, but a trebuchet is not exactly portable; as far as I'm aware, it would have to be either built or at least assembled on the spot, which would generally prevent you from opening a siege with bombardment. \n\nThe linked discussion goes into more detail about how trebuchets were not really movable and were mostly constructed on the spot.

He cites Diamond’s work extensively and, with the aid of fun graphics, tries to explain the apparent one-way transfer of infectious disease after contact. \n\nThe ideas presented in the video are not new, they were outlined in *GG&amp;S* almost twenty years ago, and Diamond borrowed extensively from Alfred Crosby’s 1986 *Ecological Imperialism* for his central thesis.

Also, this October a group of archaeologists, biological anthropologists, historians, and ethnohistorians published what will be the key text in the infectious disease debate for the immediate future. If you don’t believe me, a nerd who likes to discuss history on reddit, I hope you will check out the book. To quote the introduction to [*Beyond Germs: Native Depopulation in North America*](https://books.google.com/books/about/Beyond_Germs.html?id=yUw-rgEACAAJ&amp;hl=en)\n\n&gt; We may never know the full extent of Native depopulation… but what is certain is that a generation of scholars has significantly overemphasized disease as the cause of depopulation, downplaying the active role of Europeans in inciting wars, destroying livelihoods, and erasing identities. This scholarly misreading has given support to a variety of popular writers who have misled and are currently misleading the public.\n\nIf *GG&amp;S* is the history book to rule them all then, like Tolkien’s One Ring, *GG&amp;S* is an attractive but fundamentally corruptive influence. Here I’ll briefly explain several of the issues while focusing on one key assumption of the video: universal, catastrophic, irrecoverable demographic decline due to infectious disease transfer from the Old World to the New.\n\n**&gt;90% Mortality Due to Disease**\n\nI addressed aspects of the &gt; 90% mortality due to disease in [this post, Death by Disease Alone](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2u4d53/myths_of_conquest_part_seven_death_by_disease/), which I quote briefly. The 90-95% figure that dominates the popular discourse has its foundation in the study of mortality in conquest-period Mexico. Several terrible epidemics struck the population of greater Mexico (estimated at ~22 million at contact) in quick succession. Roughly 8 million died in the 1520 smallpox epidemic, followed closely by the 1545 and 1576 cocoliztli epidemics where ~12-15 million and ~2 million perished, respectively ([Acuna-Soto et al., 2002](https://books.google.com/books?id=GutvPQAACAAJ&amp;dq=a+history+of+greater+mexico&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9-Pj8tK_JAhXHbiYKHRRuAoIQ6AEIJTAB)). After these epidemics and other demographic insults, the population in Mexico hit its nadir (lowest point) by 1600 before slowly beginning to recover.\nThough the data from Mexico represents a great work of historic demography, the mortality figures from one specific place and time have been uncritically applied across the New World.\n\nTwo key factors are commonly omitted when transferring the 90-95% mortality seen in Mexico to the greater Americas: (1) the 90-95% figure represents all excess mortality after contact (including the impact of warfare, famine, slavery, etc. with disease totals), and (2) disease mortality in Mexico was highest in densely populated urban centers where epidemics spread by rapidly among a population directly exposed to large numbers of Spanish colonists. Very few locations in the Americas mimic these ecological conditions, making the application of demographic patterns witnessed in one specific location inappropriate for generalization to the entire New World. In a far different location, lowland Amazonia, most groups showed an ~80% mortality rate from all sources of excess mortality (not just disease) in the years immediately following contact, with ~75% of indigenous societies becoming extinct ([Hamilton et al., 2014](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep04541?message-global=remove&amp;WT.ec_id=SREP-631-20140408)). However, examining bioarchaeological, historical, and ethnohistorical accounts show a variety of demographic responses to contact, including relative stasis and an absence of early catastrophic disease spread.\n\nBioarchaeological evidence, like Hutchinson’s detailed analysis of Tatham Mounds, a burial site along the route taken by de Soto through Florida, show no evidence of mass graves indicative of early epidemics. Even at sites along the route of a major *entrada*, where at least one individual displays evidence of skeletal trauma from steel weapons, the burial practices reflect the gradual and orderly placement of individuals, just as before, and not mass graves associated with catastrophic disease mortality. There is likewise no evidence of disease introduction into New Mexico until a century after Coronado’s *entrada*. \n\n&gt; The silence of records from the sixteenth-century Spanish exploring expeditions to New Mexico on the subject of disease and the apparent absence of large-scale reduction in the number of settlements during that time combine to reinforce the idea that the Pueblo population did not suffer epidemics of European diseases until the 1636-41 period. (Barrett 2002, quoted in Jones 2015)\n\nThere is no evidence of early catastrophic decline among the Huron-Petun between 1475 and 1633, and despite centuries of continued contact in the U.S. Southeast the first smallpox epidemic finally occurred at the close of the seventeenth century. Hamalainen suggests the Comanches did not face significant disease mortality until after 1840, and mission records in California indicate measles and smallpox arrived quite late, 1806 and 1833, nearly fifty years after the start of the missions.\n\nCould early catastrophic epidemics have taken place during this early period? Absolutely. But to argue for universal cataclysmic epidemic disease mortality spreading ahead of European explorers is to argue from an absence of evidence. In fact, as scholars dive deeper into the history of the protohistoric, the hypothesis becomes untenable. \n\n**”A Passive Biological Weaponry”**\n\nThe quote above, taken from the video, encapsulates the key issue with overemphasizing the importance of infectious disease when discussing the repercussions of contact: placing blame on disease alone (1) divorces disease mortality from the larger host and ecological setting, (2) contextualizes the narrative of contact in terms of eventual Native American defeat, and (3) obscures the centuries of structural violence in the form of warfare, massacres, enslavement, forced labor, territorial restriction and displacement, and resource deprivation poured out over generations.\n\nIn the Myths of Conquest series I quoted Wilcox’s [*The Pueblo Revolt and the Mythology of Conquest: An Indigenous Archaeology of Contact*](https://books.google.com/books?id=wX0QAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=wilcox+archaeology+of+the+Pueblo+revolt&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s), and here I will do so again\n\n&gt; One consequence of dominance of “disease and acculturation models” of the postcontact period has been a lack of scholarly attention paid to the subjects of conflict, violence, and resistance between colonists and Native peoples through extended periods of time.\n\nEuropean expansion into the New World was not easy, fast, or benign. A century after initial contact more than two million peopled lived east of the Mississippi River. Less than five hundred were European. By 1820 the descendants of European colonists finally gained hegemony east of the Mississippi River. In those two hundred plus years between initial contact and 1820 a pattern of structural violence defined the relationships between European colonists and Native American nations. \n\nStructural violence behaviors are “structural because they are defined within the context of existing political, economic, and social structures, and they are a record of violence because the outcomes cause death and debilitation” ([Farmer et al., 2006](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449)). In the Americas this pattern of behavior includes forced population displacement, engaging in the widespread collection and exportation of Native American slaves, inciting wars to fuel the Indian slave trade, intentional resource destruction to decrease Native American resistance, massacres and display violence against both combatants and non-combatants, a variety of forced labor practices ranging from modification of mit’a tribute systems to mission and *encomiendas* work quotas, and centuries of identity erasure that served to deny Native American heritage and, on paper, fuel the perception of a terminally declining Indian presence in the New World. \n\nThis structural violence could not extinguish the vitality of Native American communities who resisted and accommodated, waged war and forged peace, negotiated and re-negotiated and re-negotiated their positions with more than half a dozen European nations and their colonial offspring over the course of 500 years. Powerful confederacies, like the Creek and Cherokee, rose from the destruction wrought by the slave trade and used their influence to sway the history of the continent. In 1791 the short-lived Northwestern Confederacy nearly annihilated the United States Army on the banks of the Maumee River. Other nations, like the Osage, displaced from their homeland remade themselves in the interior of the continent where they dominated the horse and firearm trade, claiming vast swathes of the Plains as their own. Some, like the Kussoe, refused to engage in English slaving raids and were ruthlessly attacked, surviving members fleeing inland to join new confederacies. Still others, like the Seminole, never formally surrendered and continue to defy claims to a completed conquest.\n\n**The Terminal Narrative**\n\nThe Terminal Narrative permeates nearly every popular, and even many scholarly, discussions of Native American history. Per the narrative, Columbus’s arrival on San Salvador functions as an event horizon, the beginning of the end after which Native American history could only flow on one inevitable and completely destructive course. Those seeking a blameless, passive cause for this decline place the focus on introduced infectious organisms. Disease becomes a “morally neutral biohistorical force” (Jones, 2015) or as Grey states, a “passive biological weaponry”. Introduced infectious diseases did increase mortality, and made demographic recovery challenging. However, in the Myths of Conquest series I argued against the terminal narrative, urging instead a focus on the active agents and the thousands of “what ifs” hidden under the creeping determinism that assumes Native American decline and near extinction.\n\nEuropeans did not need a “passive biological weapon”, they were quite satisfied to actively wield their own literal weapons as they attempted to enforce their will on the inhabitants of a New World. Native Americans weren’t so desolate that they simply gave up and allowed conquest to occur. Vibrant communities controlled their own destiny, rolled back the Spanish frontier in North American through violent revolts, conducted feats of diplomacy to pit colonial powers against each other, and in acts both large and small actively negotiated their way into a global trade network. \n\nThere is no easy narrative of Native American history after contact. It was a hard fought struggle for both sides, one that we are, in many ways, still fighting five centuries later. A myopic fascination disease obscures five centuries of our shared history on these continents. There are shelves of books, and reams of articles, with evidence against the myth of death by disease alone. *Guns, Germs, and Steel* is not the history book to rule all history books. It may be a place to start, but if it is your one precious source please consider further reading.\n\nFurther posts on the inaccuracies of Grey to come.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3u6vrb/badhistory_reagan_irancontra_and_the_1980s/",
        "text": "This is my first post here, so please let me know if I've run afoul of any sub-reddit rules!\n\nThe post in question:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/3u3dfi/blast_from_the_past_i_just_became_aware_of/cxbl4oy?context=3\n\nThe post begins with this statement as to why Reagan wasn't impeached for the Iran-Contra Scandal\n\n&gt; The American Left circa 1987-1988 was so demoralized, neutered, and powerless that even though there WAS a massive outcry and outrage against Reagan, North, et al. for the Iran-Contra scandal among people in the US who were paying attention, Americans were in no mood to see justice done about it.\n\nFar from the American Left from being in shambles in 1987-1988, the Democratic Party was going through quite a resurgence that had begun in 1986 with the congressional mid-term elections. Six Reagan Republicans who came in to the Senate in 1980s were kicked out of office, and the Democrats held a majority of 55-45. Moreover, in late 1986 the Democrats chose Jim Wright as Speaker of the House, and Wright effectively led the passage of several major bills, like a modified clean water act, that were opposed by Reagan. Recalling his time as Speaker, Wright stated that, \"We [Democrats] were getting everything we wanted here in the House.\" While the late 1980s certainly wasn't a liberal heyday, stating that the American Left was \"neutered\" and \"powerless\" is incredibly inaccurate.\n\nNext sentence of the post:\n\n&gt; Americans were in no mood to see justice done about it. We'd been successfully indoctrinated into the ideas that a) the Contras were \"freedom fighters,\" that b) Reagan was everyone's kindly, wise ex-cowboy grandfather and thus could do no wrong, and c) it simply wasn't \"cool\" to be politically aware back then.\n\nRegarding point a), I can say from my own research that the issue of the Contras and the American public perception of them as freedom fighters played a relatively minor role in the Iran-Contra scandal. Looking at the media responses to the scandal (which I did for my Master's thesis), what's shocking is the relative lack of discussion about US funding to the Contras; the American press was much more concerned about the fact that the Reagan administration was giving weapons to Iran, a state-sponsor of terrorism. As the conservative *National Review* stated, \"Reagan might as well have sen[t] arms to Libya, Syria, and the PLO, on the grounds that we have discovered a wonderful formula for eliminating terrorism.\" The *Washington Post* was likewise highly critical of Reagan, stating that the president had \"went 'Carter'\" by negotiating with terrorists.\n\nPoint b) is essentially correct, with the exception of the \"wise\" point, which I'll get to later. This--the public perception of Reagan as a genuinely kind and innocent man--is *a* significant, but by no means *the* significant reason for why Congress didn't move to impeach the president.\n\nI don't have much to rebut point c) as the statement is pretty superficial. If we were to try to quantify how \"cool\" political awareness was, we might glean some information from [voter turnout](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/turnout.php), which would show that the 1984 presidential election had about the same turnout (53%) as most other presidential elections that occurred during the period from 1972-2012. (The election of 1988 is only somewhat of an outlier, with 50% turnout. It's important to note, though, that George H.W. Bush ran his election campaign with the point of distancing himself from the Reagan administration and many of its policies. In the Reagan administration's final year, its [approval ratings](http://www.gallup.com/poll/11887/ronald-reagan-from-peoples-perspective-gallup-poll-review.aspx) were at 48%, the lowest since 1984.) As a brief and final point on this issue of political awareness in the 1980s, in regards to the Iran-Contra Scandal, roughly 70% of Americans tuned in to watch the Oliver North hearings. So, if Americans weren't aware of politics in general, they were certainly keenly aware and interested in the Iran-Contra Scandal.\n\n&gt; The 80s were a time of serious reactionary thought and action against the progress made in the 60s and 70s, actions that were supposed to be making government accountable.\n\nYes, historians generally argue that the 1980s was a conservative decade, but it's important to note that this dominance of conservatism lasted a little more than a couple of years, from 1984 to late 1986-early 1987. In fact, by the time of the Iran-Contra Scandal, Reagan and the conservatives were facing a large degree of criticism for the lack of government intervention in several social and economic crises. As the historian Doug Rossinow has stated, by late 1986 \"a manifold crisis enveloped the 'Reagan Revolution...[This was] not just a crisis of conservative governance but a crisis of legitimacy for conservatism as a philosophy and movement.\" The United States' Savings-and-Loans industry collapsed due to rampant corruption and the lack of government oversight, which cost American taxpayers about $130 billion dollars and likely contributed to the economic downturn of 1990-1991. Reagan also took flak from the public for his tragically slow response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In other words, by the late 1980s many Americans were clamoring for greater government intervention and accountability, albeit not to the same degree as the eras of the New Deal or Great Society.\n\n&gt; It also didn't help that Oliver North was photogenic and played into this hackneyed cliche image people had of the All-American crop-haired do-gooder \"Boy Scout\" military man; there was still a lot of romance surrounding people who gave off that kind of aura back then - probably having something to do with the lasting aura of WWII and the idea that the US's \"failure\" to \"win\" Vietnam needed to be avenged.\n\nThis is generally correct. The U.S. did go through a very brief period of \"Olliemania\" when North became a prominent yet divisive pop culture icon. But Americans' support for North shouldn't be over-stated; by August of 1987, 2/3 of Americans thought that North's actions were more wrong than right.\n\n&gt; As far as Reagan himself was concerned, he'd already by this point been exhibiting signs of Alzheimer's disease. His handlers later told of Reagan not knowing crucial things about what he was doing that day, what his schedule would be, where he'd been certain days - his memory and lucidity was disappearing. So it's no surprise that Reagan himself might not have even known what North, et al. were doing when they were trading arms for hostages and using the CIA to funnel crack cocaine into the US. It could have been Reagan really did NOT know what was going on - he barely knew what HE was doing from day to day. However it's much more likely that he had knowledge and let it happen because he knew that any malfeasance can be excused if the justification resonates with enough people, which happened here.\n\nIt seems the OP doesn't know where he stands on this issue of Reagan's knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair. He first states that Reagan didn't know what he was doing because of Alzheimer's, then says Reagan probably knew what he was doing. To answer this question, I'll first link to [this AMA](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3sm68o/ama_ronald_reagan_and_the_irancontra_affair/) by Malcolm Byrne, who has written what is thus far the most comprehensive and analytically thorough account of Iran-Contra. Byrne concludes that Reagan \"was the driving force...behind the affair.\" Byrne's conclusions are backed up by several respected historians including Doug Rossinow, Sean Wilentz, and H.W. Brands. And as to Reagan's fight against Alzheimer's, Nancy Reagan claims that it wasn't until late 1989 that the effects of the disease became noticeable. Historians and biographers of Reagan have supported that conclusion, or even pushed the date of Reagan's mental decline to the mid-1990s. In general, historians agree that Reagan's confusing responses to the Tower investigation in the late 1980s were the result of a mixture of deception and the president's lifelong tendency to have memory lapses.\n\nSources:\n\nH.W.

        "text": "Today I'll be covering the final part of the film Kingdom of Heaven in which Saladin takes Jerusalem from the crusaders after a spirited defence by Balian de Ibelin (Orlando Bloom). I did some searching for a decent clip of the siege, but for some reason people think the native soundtrack wasn't good enough and dump some music of their own over it. So apologies for that, The best I could find was [a Vimeo clip](https://vimeo.com/39560768#t=1m37s) with some music over it - you might want to turn down the volume (and don't worry, I have a better clip for the part with the siege towers).\n\nFirstly I want to address a few things that aren't really covered in the siege bit, but irk me so much I'm going to cover them anyway: \n\n1. The setting in the film of Jerusalem. They show the city a couple of times surrounded by flat grounds with a few low hills in the distance, set in the middle of barren, desert-like grounds. That's pretty much categorically wrong. [The city is on hilly terrain](http://i.imgur.com/v7ThhXX.jpg), around 700m above sea level (and remember, it's close to the Dead Sea which is at -300m, so the geography is fairly dramatic in places), has natural springs in, and around the city, and is surrounded by forested hills. Prepare for a lot of climbing when you visit it. The desolate place from the film is too much of a Middle East = Desert Everywhere stereotype. \n\n2. Balian de Ibelin. There's so much wrong with this character in the film that it would take a whole post of its own to cover him, but suffice to say the most relevant part here is that: he a respected, influential noble, he *was* at the Battle of Hattin and in command of the rear guard, and he managed to break out with around 3000 infantry. He was also one of the more experienced and respected commanders in general, and after Hattin one of the few.\n\n3. Raynald of Châtillon was possibly an even bigger arsehole than the film portraits him to be (I just wanted to say that because I can't stand the guy and also in case people think he's exaggerated in the film for dramatic purposes - don't take this point too serious please). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# **The Siege Begins**\n\n**I Love the Smell of Fireballs at Night**\n\nThe clip starts at night as Saladin (I'm going to be using the Latinised version of his name because it's significantly faster to type than Salah-ad-Din each time) arrives at Jerusalem and opens up with a lightshow by flinging flaming rocks at the city from hundreds of trebuchets. And we interrupt the film here for a couple of siege warfare bad history bits - I cover the historical bad bits below this section. \n\nThis is a terrible scene from a history point of view. Granted it's dramatic and very cinematic, but historically it's completely wrong, and as a siege strategy it makes little sense either. Saladin's initial attack was not at night (night attacks are pretty rare in general because they're so hard to coordinate) and he didn't deploy any trebuchets or other missile siege engines for the first four days of the siege. He didn't want to damage the city and didn't expect much resistance from the defenders. And finally he didn't even attack right away, as elsewhere after Hattin, he negotiated with the defenders first. And only when that went nowhere useful did he start the siege. \n\nAnd here I get a bit more technical:\n\n* You wouldn't start a bombardment at night. Just before the siege starts we see the clever defenders mapping out ranges with stones so they know when to fire their siege engines for maximum effect. The attackers would do the same. The trebuchets shown in the film are pretty accurate siege machines, so once you've ranged them in, you can concentrate your fire on one section of wall. BTW for a nice demo of how a trebuchet would be fired, [there's this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR26RMI9T8c) and a very heavy one at [Warwick Castle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApwIGvUjZoE).\n* They shoot insanely far. I've counted the time it takes for the first projectile to hit the city and it's almost nine seconds. you can also see some around the 2 minute mark come in at a really shallow trajectory, which would require some really impossibly powerful trebuchets. The maximum/ideal range release angle for a treb is 45 degrees and at maximum range, the impact angle would be fairly steep and not that effective against walls. Those low flying balls would be more likely to be fired from a cannon than a trebuchet. The average/optimal range would be around the 200-250m mark. Out of range of the archers, and perfectly lined up to smack stones into the wall while transferring as much force as possible.\n* So many fireballs! The amount of siege engines used by Saladin is just insane. He didn't even deploy his siege engines at first, and even though he had a massive army at his disposal he wouldn't have that many trebuchets. I don't have a source with numbers, but from looking at other sieges at the time, or slightly later, you're more likely to look at single digits. Richard the Lionhart uses three at Acre for example.\n* Fire! Boom! Roll! The ammo either explodes or rolls. You can fire flaming ammo from trebuchets btw, I have no problems with that, but the flaming balls of fire would either be hollow, pitch filled balls designed to shatter on impact and coat a large area in fire (not exactly explode as shown at 2:13 for example), or solid balls, covered in pitch to knock through roofs and the like to set fire to the soft targets. If one of those were to hit a wall, it wouldn't do much more damage than a normal stone would. Certainly not turn al flamey and stuff.\n* Fire is more of a last resort attack. It's hardly ever used right at the start of a siege (I can't think of any, but it's hard to get 100% accurate on this one without knowing all possible sieges in the world). It tends to burn down things you want to keep in one piece, especially if the city is of such historical significance as Jerusalem. If you've ever been to the old city of Jerusalem, you notice that it's streets are very narrow, and the place is tightly packed with houses. A fire breaking out there would be very risky. [In 1187 the city was smaller than the current old city](http://i.imgur.com/OI4t8N3.jpg) (and the Roman/Byzantine city), but inside it would be very similar to what [you'd see today](http://i.imgur.com/m4oLyf5.png) (souvenir shops optional).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n(man, this is going to be even longer than the Robin Hood one - this will be another two parter. I'm closing off the siege part of the film here and continue next week, but I will cover the whole historical part of it below since it makes sense to do so)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**And here's what really happened**\n\nSaladin took his time going to Jerusalem after Hattin and that was entirely logical on his part. Firstly, he was presented with a unique opportunity to take a lot of cities and castles that were stripped of manpower courtesy of Hattin. What normally would have been a siege that could take his whole campaign season for the year, could now be rounded up in days. In light of the other places to conquer, Jerusalem was not that important except symbolically. It was inland, fairly isolated, and didn’t have much strategical value. On the other hand, the port cities like Acre, Ascelon, Jaffa, Sidon, and Tyre were very important. Crusaders would receive reinforcements and supplies through them, and without those, anything inland wouldn’t stand much of a chance. So he went for Acre, which was the key economic centre of the Kingdom. After taking it, he split up his army sending one part south and the other north, conquering nearly every city or castle on the coast.\n\nSecondly once Jerusalem was conquered, he knew that most of his army would consider the “job done” and go home. So before that, he’d use them as long as possible on other tasks, and finish off the season at Jerusalem. And use them he did: in the two and a half months between Hattin and Jerusalem he conquered a staggering 52 towns and castles, mostly by offering very generous terms to the defenders. When he showed up at the gates of Jerusalem, of the ports of the Kingdom only Tyre was still in crusader hands and then only because Conrad of Montferrat arrived just in time with reinforcements.\n\nSaladin wanted to take the city intact to minimise the risk of damage to the holy sites, and initially offered similar general terms of surrender to the defenders. The defenders refused, so the siege started. In light of what had happened elsewhere, he didn’t expect Jerusalem to put up much of a fight. But what he didn’t realise that the defenders were extremely determined to hold on to their holy city, despite their hopeless situation. At first he planned to storm the city by attacking the area around [David’s Gate and the Citadel, and Tancred’s Tower]( http://i.imgur.com/AqvyiZ4.jpg). **No ranged siege weapons were deployed in the first four days**, just ladders and siege towers. The defenders managed to drive the attackers back with minimal losses to themselves and inflicted a large number of casualties on Saladin’s troops. Not shown in the film, but the defenders made a number of extremely successful sorties, one nearly reaching Saladin’s encampment (you’d expect these to be in the film really since they’re pretty dramatic).\n\nAfter realising that his current plan wasn’t working, Saladin moved his armies to the north-eastern sections of the city, which is roughly the same place the crusaders attacked when they took the city in 1099. At this point the ranged siege weaponry was deployed, together with sappers who started to undermine the walls. After three days the sappers managed to collapse a section of the wall, but the attackers couldn’t break through into the city. However, the defenders were in fairly dire straits at this point, so Balian picked up negotiations again accepting the initial terms. Saladin refused, pointing out that his flag had already been raised on the walls, but for dramatic effect at that point his army was driven away from the wall and the flag was taken down (honestly this sounds a bit too convenient). What probably convinced Saladin to accept terms, is Balian’s threat to destroy the whole city if he wouldn’t. Negotiations went on, and eventually the city was surrendered, ransoms were paid for as many citizens as possible, but 15,000 poor sods were unable to pay and were carried away into slavery.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNext time I'll cover the rest of the attack - I promise it will be a bit more than the first 30 seconds. :)\n\n\n**Sources:**\n\nNot too many of the classics cover the Siege of Jerusalem in great detail. It's almost as if they're in a hurry to close off that chapter and start on the Third Crusade chapter. \n\nRunciman's three parter \"The History of the Crusades\" only mention sketchy details about the siege, fairly similar to the [Wikipedia entry on the siege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(1187\\)). My main source is \"Downfall of the Crusader Kingdom: The Battle of Hattin and the Loss of Jerusalem\" by Bartlett, and I also used a [podcast by the Real Crusade History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8kh1qcQl_Y). To some extend Lane-Poole's book [\"Saladin and the Fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem\"](https://archive.org/details/saladinandfallk01lanegoog) is very interesting, and a ripping read, but do keep in mind that it's a fairly biased and old source.\n\n**[Edit] Gold once more. Again you have my thanks, most generous sponsor. It's not necessary, but certainly appreciated!**",

        "text": "Back in 2009 Donald Trump [bought](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/13/AR2009021303352.html) the Lowes Island Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia. Six years and [$25 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/digger/wp/2015/06/23/trump-tees-up-25-million-in-upgrades-at-loudoun-golf-club/) later the renovations were complete. \n\nWhen he was done with it I guess he thought he would spice up the place by tying it into local history (and admirable move), only instead of actually using local history he just decided to make shit up.\n\nHe installed a plaque which reads:\n\n&gt;Many great American soldiers, both of the North and South, died at this spot,” the inscription reads. “The casualties were so great that the water would turn red and thus became known as ‘The River of Blood.’ \n\nUnfortunately for him, no such battle was ever fought in Sterling, VA. The [Battle of Ball's Bluff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ball%27s_Bluff) was fought in Loudoun Co, VA, but that's the closest battle to the golf course that's ever been fought. Definitely no battle that became known as \"The River of Blood\".\n\nWhen asked about it Trump's responses are stereo-typical anti-intellectualism.\n\n&gt;“That was a prime site for river crossings,” Mr. Trump said. “So, if people are crossing the river, and you happen to be in a civil war, I would say that people were shot — a lot of them.”\n\nReally? A river crossing counts as a battle? At least he got that much right.\n\n**Edit**: Right that there's a river crossing near the golf course. Not that people were shot at that river crossing. \n\n&gt;“How would they know that?” Mr. Trump asked, when told that local historians had called his plaque a fiction. “Were they there?”\n\nThe Civil War wasn't exactly before the dawn of writing. \n\n\n&gt;“Write your story the way you want to write it,” Mr. Trump said finally, when pressed unsuccessfully for anything that could corroborate his claim. “You don’t have to talk to anybody. It doesn’t make any difference. But many people were shot. It makes sense.\n\nThis attitude is scary and too common. It's also an interesting one from a historiographical perspective. It's the clash between history and memory and what counts as history vs memory. They're not always the same, and the history of one group might not be the same history as another group, and the history of one group might be seen as an attack on the cultural memory of another. It's one reason why we have such outrage anytime under-represented groups try to reclaim their history. \n\n[Here's](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/03/the-problem-with-history-classes/387823/) a fantastic piece from The Atlantic on history and memory and how they intertwine and sometimes oppose each other. \n",

        "text": "On /r/crusaderkings there is a video describing why the spread of disease in the Colombian Exchange was unidirectional: as you can imagine, it's all about how the Americans got a shitty start with no cattle.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEYh5WACqEk\n\nThread:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/3txwpz/the_reason_why_the_aztecs_didnt_give_the/\n\nAnd here is a copypasta of my write-up. Half badscience half badhistory. \n\n\"This is basically a pure GGaS argument. From the historical side, as pointed out already, Mesoamerica, the Mississippi region, the Andes, and even the Amazon Rainforest had extremely dense populations, often with more complex urban planning than the Old World. The Eurocentric view that plow based agriculture relying on beasts of burden is necessary for civilization just doesn't stand up to the facts which are that complex horticulture and aquaculture have been shown to be equally sustainable, and New World maize agriculture is even more productive than the Old World style of agriculture. Bread wheat was a biological accident, an autopolyploidy resulting in a huge kernel, Maize was selectively bred over thousands of year to be extremely productive.\n\nFurther, livestock was ubiquitous in the New World too, particularly dogs and llamas, with monkeys often living in close proximity to humans. Horses existed in the New World too, they were just hunted to extirpation early on. He makes a big point about how \"buffalo\" (bison) are too big and unpredictable to be domesticated. That seems logical if you compare bison to a modern cow, which are fat and docile, but cows are the product of human domestication. Before cows there were aurochs, and I would wager an aurochs bull would be no more docile than bison.\n\nHe goes on to talk about Llamas, saying that they are somehow harder to manage than cows. He doesn't really explain his line of thinking, but Llamas are incredibly smart and will learn the trails they travel along, as well as the rest stops along the trails. Given time, the alpha male will effectively herd its own pack, leading the way along trails, finding shelter and ensuring the pack stays safe. Eventually they'll decide they know the route and schedule better than the herder, and start to ignore him/her. Llamas seem like kind of a joke animal, but they really are fascinating.\n\nWith regards to domesticated bees, he makes a quip about how you can't have a civilization founded on honey bees alone, which is really perplexing to anyone who understands the critical role pollinators, and bees in particular, have in modern food production.\n\nAlso, one domestication candidate he seems to ignore is Reindeer, which were domesticated in the Old World, but not the New World, and I don't think anyone knows why. I would further argue that its a mistake to look at domestication as a calculated endeavor; it's feasibility depends entirely on the society in question and it always occurs over many generations.\n\nGoing into the epidemiological, its entirely wrong to say that pathogens don't know they're in humans. Most viruses/pathogenic bacteria are extremely specific in host recognition. And they do it in the same way our immune system does it for the most part, by feeling MHC receptors which identify almost all cells. You can't get a liver transplant from a cow because it is extremely easy for your body to recognize that it isn't human, and most pathogens are equally picky when choosing a host.\nInfections that are extremely virulent are not always unstable, in that there are numerous ways in which they can avoid killing off all their hosts at once. Some can hide away in human carriers (think Typhoid Mary) or stay indefinitely in select other species that can carry the disease and spread it without becoming ill, or even desiccate themselves to become essentially immortal outside of a host. \n\nFurther, extreme virulence very often facilitates the spread of disease, a good example of this is how diarrhea causing illnesses are general spread via fecal-oral transmission.\n\nSo then why didn't the Native Americans send any diseases back to Europe? (Some people say they did, citing Syphilis. Personally I hold the belief that Syphilis was considered a form of leprosy, and there is a surprising amount of evidence to support that). The main reason why there weren't many diseases in the Americas is fairly simple, and that is that the original settlers of the New World came from a really tight population bottleneck. Not many human pathogens came to the New World because not many people came to the New World across the Bering Strait. Once in the New World the pathogens they might come in contact with would not have any machinery necessary to recognize anything close to human, because there were never any hominids or even apes in the New World prior to that.\"\n\nEdit: I should add that I have no formal education on Precolombian history, I just studied ecology in the Amazon Rainforest.",

        "text": "The fall of reasonable Rome and the ascendance of the despotic Church.  Yep, it's time to go *there* again.\n\nSo I came across this article on Facebook today:\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.ca/debra-macleod/pagan-culture_b_7058758.html?ir=Religion&amp;ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000051\n\n'Should the Catholic Church Acknowledge the Destruction of Classical Pagan Culture?' is the title.  I could tell right off the bat that this was going to be on Agora levels on inaccuracy - and lo and behold, I was right.\n\nI'll begin by saying that, in all fairness, the author does acknowledge that the pagan Roman world was not all the 'peace and tolerance' that it's typically made out to be and that we're usually bombarded with, stating:\n\n&gt; To be sure, Christians suffered under the early Empire ... It was all too strange and disruptive for the Romans who never hesitated to take harsh action against agitators or troublemakers of any kind (including pagan ones). \n\nUnfortunately, that's just about the only good history that we're getting here, because the author then continues with this:\n\n&gt; To solidify Christianity as the sole religion of the Empire, early Christian leaders legalized brutal policies that persecuted pagans. This gave Christians the legal green light to commit atrocious acts of vandalism that destroyed centuries of Classical art, history and culture. \n\nWhat I don't get here is the apparent cognitive dissonance.  Why does the author in one breath lionise the pagan Romans as paradigms of virtue despite noting their occasional excesses of brutality and intolerance, and in another condemn the Christian Romans for showing levels of religious intolerance that were no worse than those shown by their predecessors?\n\nShe links us to a Wikipedia article describing the anti-pagan decrees passed by various Christian Emperors (most notably Theodosius).  However, the anti-pagan decrees, even at their worst, did not aim to 'solidify Christianity as the sole religion of the Empire'.  Jews and pagans were still permitted to perform their own rites, the difference being that the pagans had their rites removed from *state* religion, and replaced with Christian ones.  Despite what the wig-wearing fops of the Enlightenment would have you think, pre-modern peoples (including the Romans) had no separation of Church and State per se; both pagan Roman Emperors and Christian Roman Emperors had their own religious rites put into public state religion.  And there is good evidence that individual Christians suffered far worse under the pagan state religion of Rome than individual pagans did under the Christian state religion.  We need only look to St. John Chrysostom, for instance, stating close to the time of these events taking place: \"No Christian emperor could ever issue decrees  against you [i.e pagans] such as the devil-worshippers [i.e pagan emperors such as Valerian or Diocletian] issued against us.\"  Likewise, co-existence between individual pagans and individual Christians did happen as well.  Recall, for instance, that St. Augustine (who lived at this time) came from a mixed family of a Pagan father and a Christian mother.\n\n&gt; Christian vandals smashed the heads and limbs off statues of beloved gods and goddesses that had been venerated for generations. They knocked the noses off the faces, and carved crosses into the foreheads, of deities, heroes and emperors. \n\nGranted, this did occasionally happen, especially during times of mob violence.  But even this isn't much of a point.  Prior to Christianity, 'pagans' had been doing the same thing to one another for many years.  The ancient world wasn't all sunshine and daisies, you know.  \n\nAlso, the fact that quite a lot of Classical art and architecture has survived to this very day is testament to the fact that there wasn't any kind of systematic attempt to wipe out all pagan culture everywhere.  \n\n&gt; They burned ancient texts, obliterating centuries of knowledge, literature and heritage.  These acts of vandalism robbed our Western civilization of a beautiful and important part of our own art history and culture. We'll never know what monuments or statuary were smashed to dust, or what masterpieces of literature or learning were turned to smoke. \n\nThere are no citations given.  I'm taking it that she's referring to the Library of Alexandria here.  And we all know what's wrong with that particular historical tidbit ...\n\n&gt; To usurp the importance of the Vestals, the Catholic church eventually created its own version of priestesses -- nuns. Like the Vestals who were married to Rome, the nuns would be married to their god. Like the Vestals were celibate, the nuns would be celibate. Yet where the Vestals had power and privilege, the nuns would live in poverty and subservience. \n\nDear me, are you honestly implying that nuns were never powerful or wealthy?  Also, you need only ask Emperor Julian why the Christians won in the end.  Here's a hint: it has something to do with acts of charity being extolled as virtuous, which sort of goes hand-in-hand with all that 'poverty and subservience' stuff that you just decried.\n\n&gt; They created an arsenal of saints to replace the rich diversity of pagan gods and goddesses. \n\nIt's uncontroversial that some were syncretised, but the very concept of saints is a purely Christian one going right back to biblical books - especially Revelation.  You aren't going to tell me that St. Cyprian and St. Ambrose were christianised pagan deities, are you?\n\n&gt; Symbolism and ritual from pagan traditions were also claimed to have Christian origins. The flame of Vesta became the flame in Mary's immaculate heart. The wafers the Vestals made for offerings became the wafers of the Eucharist. The pagan temples that were still standing had crosses placed atop them. The list goes on.\n\nAgain, you're going to need sources here.  The Eucharist has absolutely f*** all to do with paganism and has everything to do with Passover observance and the symbolism of the Last Supper.  It's the central Christian rite, and existed since at least the time of St. Paul.  \n\n&gt; Forced conversions to Christianity were common, as was the seizure of property or assets belonging to pagans. And in an unprecedented move of religious tyranny, it became illegal - upon pain of torture or death to honor Vesta or other gods and goddesses even within the sacred privacy of one's own home.\n\nThe only link she gives here is to the Wikipedia article on 'forced conversion'.  Which states the following: 'In 392 Emperor Theodosius I decreed that Christianity was the only legal religion of the Roman Empire, and forbidding pagan practices by law ... Much of the Roman world, however, remained pagan for centuries.'\n\nI'll leave that there; there are no examples of forced conversion of pagans, or of specifically private pagan practice being prohibited on pain of death.  (And, sweet Jesus, look at that alliteration!)\n\n&gt; It isn't pleasant to hear -- especially for those who hold their religion dear -- but forced conversions and cultural destruction, done on a massive scale, played a significant role in the way Christianity established itself as the dominant religion. This approach set the tone for the fear and oppression of the \"Dark Ages\" when anything that wasn't Christian -- including science, medicine and free thought -- was deemed heretical and violently suppressed. \n\nAnd here we are!  'Science' and 'medicine' were never suppressed as heretical during the Middle Ages, and as far as 'free thought' goes, I'm not to sure that pagan emperors Nero and Caligula would have been too big on that either.  I'm honestly surprised that she didn't link to the Chart here.\n\n&gt; With the advancement of humanism and secular law, Christianity has lost most of its ability to impose its beliefs on others.\n\nDoesn't understand what 'humanism' means.  The advancement of humanism in the Renaissance is down to Christianity in the first place!  (See Erasmus, for example).\n\n&gt; We'll never know how our society might have developed, especially in terms of scientific and social advancement, had one androcentric religion not held exclusive control of so many and for so long. The ancient world was brutal, but it had its forward thinkers and rays of light.\n\nHere we get all of the typical Whig history and the 'imagine where we'd be without Christianity' Eurocentric rhetoric.  And the problems with that are all too clear: what of Japan, which never allowed Christianity to become the dominant faith?  Why were they not planting colonies on Mars during the 12th century?  And what of the greats of the Medieval Christian world?  Any mention of Albertus Magnus, or of Thomas Aquinas, or of William of Occam, or Peter Abelard, or Hildegaard von Bingen, or Robert Grosseteste?\n\n\nI'll readily admit that she's fairly balanced and doesn't go all out and try to present Classical civilisation as an idealistic paradise.  This article certainly isn't the absolute worst that I've seen.  But I will state that I'm somewhat baffled as to how a 'Classicist' (as she calls herself) manages to fall into such historical blunders.  \n\nErrare humanum est, sed in errare perseverare diabolicum.\n",

        "text": "OK, so I came across [this](http://www.jpost.com/Blogs/Why-World-Opinion-Matters/Are-Arabs-the-indigenous-people-of-Palestine-402785) recently. Now, I know the potential minefield that is the historiography of Israel-Palestine, but this is so bad as to be beyond this. Among other things, the author is trying to rehabilitate Joan Peters’ *From Time Immemorial*. As a run-through for anyone who doesn’t know, *FTI* was a book published in 1984 which purported to show that the Palestinian Arabs were not longstanding inhabitants of the region, but mostly recent arrivals from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Initially praised when first released in the US, closer studies of the book, most notably from Norman Finkelstein and Yehoshua Porath, led to most later reviews, such as in the UK after its release there in 1985, being scathing, and it became increasingly discredited. While a few still push the idea that there was significant Arab immigration to Palestine in the period, no-one seriously claims that it was anywhere near the scale Peters claimed.\n\nBut apparently no-one told Daniel Grynglas this, so let’s take a look.\n\n&gt; In history, art and literature there is no trace at all of any Muslim people referred to by anybody as “Palestinians.”\n\nI’m pretty sure most people will have heard this one before. Basically, because the Palestinians developed the (originally European) concepts of nations and nationalism later than most of the world, they should have less rights for some reason. Also, this is nothing unique to Palestinians. Most of the previously-colonised world is known by names either given by Empires or names adopted by the colonised in reaction to that. Even some European national denonyms, such as “Belgian”, are relatively new creations.\n\n&gt; Records show that it was 19th and 20th century Jewish settlement and the resulting employment opportunities that drew successive waves of Arab immigrants to Palestine. “The Arab population shows a remarkable increase ….. partly due to the import of Jewish capital into Palestine and other factors associated with the growth of the [Jewish] National Home..” (The Peel Commission Report - 1937)\n\nThat same Peel Commission Report also elsewhere says “unlike the Jewish, the [Arab] rise has been due in only a slight degree to immigration.”\n\n&gt; Before the Six Day War in 1967, when Jordan controlled the West Bank and Egypt ruled in Gaza, there was never any suggestion on the part of the \"Palestinians\" that they wanted independence in their ancestral homeland.\n\nI guess Fatah was never founded in 1959 then?\n\n&gt; In fact, before the State of Israel was born, the term \"Palestinians\" was used by the Jews to refer to themselves and their organizations. “The Palestine Post”, the Palestine Foundation Fund, Palestine Airways, and the Palestine Symphony Orchestra were all purely Jewish enterprises.\n\nGrynglas makes a claim and then cites evidence that doesn’t support it. Using the word “Palestine” in a title of your institutions does not at all suggest you call yourself a “Palestinian”, any more than British settlers in the Thirteen Colonies using “America” in titles suggests they called themselves “Americans” at the time.\n“Palestinian” *was* a term used to refer to the Yishuv in the Mandatory Era – but by the British, who applied the term to all the Mandatory Territory’s inhabitants.\n\nOh, and to give just one example of the Arabs of Palestine using the term, there was a newspaper called *Filastin* - ‘Palestine’ in Arabic – that dates back to 1911.\n\n&gt; We first hear of Arabs referred to as \"Palestinians\" when Egypt’s President Nasser, with help from the Russian KGB, established the \"Palestine Liberation Organization\" in 1964.\n\nWait, you literally just said there was no Palestinian national liberation movement before 1967, but now you’re talking about one in 1964?\n\nThen there’s some stuff from Grynglas trying to say Peters was actually a good historian, including the now obligatory Mark Twain quotes.\n\n&gt; Peter’s thorough analysis consists of 410 pages of text and 190 pages of documentary appendices. The general public could hardly be expected to wade through the 600-page tome full of data tables and quotes from hundreds of sources. Thus the book was unable to reverse the continuing fiction of the indigenous “Palestinian” people whose lands have been stolen by the Jews.\n\nActually, the problem with FTI, like most bad but credible-looking popular histories, was the exact opposite – reviewers and readers could not be expected to check every source and footnote, and subsequently simply believed what Peters said about the sources as true. It was precisely when some people *did* actually start going through them that the book began to lose its credibility.\n\n&gt; Peters calculated that in 1882, just the non-nomadic, settled Muslims in Palestine numbered 141,000.\n\nOK, here’s where we get into the real badhistory of this, which is largely just bad numbers and maths.\n\nAccording to the [Jewish Virtual Library]( http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/israel_palestine_pop.html), a source which can hardly be accused of being biased towards Palestinians, the non-Jewish population of Palestine in 1882 was 276,000. Justin McCarthy, one of the most prominent experts on Ottoman demographics, puts it even higher, at ~450,000. McCarthy’s higher estimate is backed up by Israeli demographer Sergio DellaPergola, who puts the Muslim population in 1890 as 432,000. But even if we take the lower JVL number, either Peters and Grynglas are claiming that Christians and Bedouins (who, for the record, are also Palestinians that have rights) made up nearly half Palestine’s Arab population in 1882, or this is a nonsense number.\n\n&gt; Peters calculated that in 1882, just the non-nomadic, settled Muslims in Palestine numbered 141,000. Among them, those that resided in Palestine before the 1831 Egyptian invasion numbered 75 percent, or 105,700.\n\nAgain, ridiculous given other estimates – DellaPergola gives the Muslim population in 1800 as already 246,000.\n\n&gt; The number of 105,700 thousand settled Muslims is in general agreement with other important data. Walter Lowdermilk gives the total number of 200,000 people residing in Palestine in 1850 (page 76 – Palestine Land of Promise 1944). \n\nMeanwhile, McCarthy gives a number more than double that for 1860, just 10 years later. Alexander Scholch, estimating 1850 itself, says 350,000.\n\n&gt; Arthur Ruppin estimates the total population in year 1882 as 300,000 Palestinian inhabitants, including nomadic and settled Muslims, Christians and Jews (The Jews in the Modern World, MacMillan - 1934 page 368).\n\nYep, I’m guessing that’s the JVL estimate I quoted earlier.\n\n&gt; If these 105,700 indigenous Muslims were to increase in numbers only through natural population growth, how many would they number today in 2015? This would represent the size of this population as if there were no Muslim immigration at all. \n&gt; We can calculate the estimated 2015 native population, based on natural rates of population growth. I assume that the post-1882 Muslim population in Palestine -- apart from immigration — grew at approximately the same rate as the populations of neighboring Syria, Egypt and Lebanon for which rates we have reliable data. That rate of growth was 1.1% per annum.\n\nNope, it wasn’t. Not even close. [Here’s](http://www.sis.gov.eg/newvr/egyptinfigures/Tables/1-%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%86/9.pdf) Egypt’s census data. The per annum percentage growth rate between each census is given in the first column. 11 out of 12 censuses give a population rate higher than 1.1% - and the one that isn’t is 1.09%. And they’re not just marginally above it either – 6 of the 12 give a growth rate of more than 2%.\n\n&gt; I used the compounded interest formula to do the math. Applying the 1.1% growth rate to the Muslim population resident in Palestine in 1882 yields a total number of 453,000 Muslim descendants in 2015 of these original 105,700 native people.\n\n&gt; According to the 2015 World Almanac, the current “Palestinian” population, including Israeli Arabs, and Arab residents of Gaza, Golan, Judea and Samaria totals 10,523,715 people. 453,000 descendants of indigenous Muslim residents constitute only 4.3% of the current “Palestinian” population. Therefore the other 95.7% of present-day “Palestinians” are clearly those Arabs and their descendants who migrated to Israel between 1831 and 2015.\n\nA much more obvious control case would be Israeli Arabs, as there hasn’t been any significant Arab immigration to Israel; the only major influxes have been due to the annexations of East Jerusalem and Golan. After the Nakba, roughly 156,000 Palestinian Arabs were left inside Israel. On a 1.1% growth rate, their predicted population in 2015 would be just over 320,000. The actual population of Israeli Arabs, excluding those in East Jerusalem or Golan? More than 1.3 million.\n\nAstonishingly, someone’s actually found a way to make Joan Peters’ work look even less credible than before. ",

Deposit derision that Ferguson is a good historian below. The article is [here]http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/comment/columns/NiallFerguson/article1633179.ece), get around the paywall [here](http://www.pprune.org/jet-blast/570586-breaking-paris-under-siege-11.html#post9181345).\n\nGiven that Ferguson has chosen to be uncharitable towards an entire race of people and a religion with 1.2 billion adherents, I see no reason not to return the favor. Niall Ferguson, for those happily unaware, is a Scottish historian who put out a handful of economic histories that are reasonably respected, although is primary work has been handily surpassed by David Gaider. Around 2010 he decided his lecture circuits weren't quite fun enough, so he wrote a book called *Civilization* in which he took a fresh look at the ascendance of western European powers in the early nineteenth century to a degree of global domination--if one defines fresh look\" as a reprinting of Victorian back patting under the guise of software company terminology. Telling westerners that they are awesome and should congratulate themselves for colonialism has proven a lucrative field, and so has continued telling this story with the authority of a professorship that Harvard grated him because it is Harvard. And yesterday he woke up, had his cup of coffee, and decided that, you know what, he'll be darned if he goes to bed without yelling at some Muslims.\n\nThe article begins, fittingly enough, with a fundamentally flawed premise. So to be clear, Europe is not Rome: Rome was an empire, created by hair raisingly brutal conquest, held together by an elite class that were given their authority by a central government run by a military dictator and bound together by a common language and literary practice. Furthermore, the \"threat\" facing Europe has no comparison to that of fifth century Rome, and I hope I am not violating Rule 2 to say that the desperate refugees drowning in the Mediterranean or suffocating in trucks in Austria are not organized armies crossing the Rhine as armies and being recruited by an empire centered on central Italy. One might as well compare the moon rockets to a bunny rabbit, pictures of which I will be happy to receive, by the way. The fundamental premise of the column is absurd and barely deserves being looked at, but I'll pick it apart *for you guys*.\n\n&gt;Here is how Edward Gibbon described the Goths’ sack of Rome in August 410AD: “. . . In the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed, and every restraint was removed . . . a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans; and . . . the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies . . . Whenever the Barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless. . .” \n\nWow, this sounds pretty bad, and kind of like Paris if the terrorist attack was actually the sacking of an ancient city by an army of Goths. But actually, let's see if this portrayal matches up to ancient descriptions! Here is what St. Augustine has to say in the opening of *City of God*:\n\n&gt;And they ought to attribute it to the spirit of these Christian times, that, contrary to the custom of war, these bloodthirsty barbarians spared them, and spared them for Christ's sake, whether this mercy was actually shown in promiscuous places, or in those places specially dedicated to Christ's name, and of which the very largest were selected as sanctuaries, that full scope might thus be given to the expansive compassion which desired that a large multitude might find shelter there.\n\nAugustine was writing with a purpose, to exonerate the Christian religion from those who would claim the recent disasters to befall the empire were caused by the abandoning of the traditional religion. That being said, the difference between the two accounts underscores the extent to which Gibbon is an author as much as a historian. His methodology was brilliant for the time but he loves a good descriptive passage. Using his descriptive passages for analysis is hilariously dishonest.\n\n&gt;For many years, more modern historians of “late antiquity” tended to agree with Gibbon about the gradual nature of the process. Indeed, some went further, arguing that “decline” was an anachronistic term, like the word “barbarian”. Far from declining and falling, they insisted, the Roman empire had imperceptibly merged with the Germanic tribes, producing a multicultural post-imperial idyll that deserved a more flattering label than “Dark Ages”. Recently, however, a new generation of historians has raised the possibility that the process of Roman decline was in fact sudden — and bloody — rather than smooth. \n\nHere Ferguson decides to create a hilariously dishonest strawman. Saying that the transformationists describe a \"multicultural post-imperial idyll\" is nothing more than a transparent attempt to get xenophobic right wingers to harrumph in agreement over their tea at the silly perfidity and soft heartedness of lefties. If anything, these historians such as Peter Brown and Christopher Wickham tend to stress the strong continuities with Rome--Wickham even titled his recent book on the Early Middle Ages *The Inheritance of Rome* because he argues the empire cast such a heavy pall over the politics of the period. It is true that a recent reconciliation of historical and archaeological evidence has increased the prominence of \"catastrophists\" (I count myself among them) but portraying the debate as stodgy, out of touch transformationists vs young, freethinking catastrophists. It is a complex debate and if anything those arguing for a definite \"fall\" of Rome have tended to have the upper hand, at least in the broader field of classics (within the specialty transformationists tended to be somewhat more prominent because they play well with Medievalists, but this has changed).\n\n&gt;For Bryan Ward-Perkins, what happened was “violent seizure . . . by barbarian invaders”. The end of the Roman west, he writes in The Fall of Rome (2005), “witnessed horrors and dislocation of a kind I sincerely hope never to have to live through; and it destroyed a complex civilisation, throwing the inhabitants of the West back to a standard of living typical of prehistoric times”. \n\nWard-Perkins is a solid historian, so I will point out that he is using \"the West\" in the context of the Roman Empire, that is the western half. Ferguson has conveniently edited the passage such that \"he West appears to be used in its modern sense. That aside, I will note that even though material culture declined significantly in complexity, recent research into health indicators seen in bones have argued that standard of living indicators [increased](http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/scheidel/011001.pdf). The \"benign influence of Rome\" may not have been so benign. Shocking that an empire controlled through military force and created through bloodshed may not have been Sesame Street.\n\nIn the rest of the article he continues to push his absurd viewpoint that Muslims and other brown folk are literally Odoacer, which I can't respond to without treading on Rule 2 more than I am. So I will leave by quoting a hilarious;y telling admission by Ferguson:\n\n&gt;I do not know enough about the fifth century\n\nAnd note that the horrible events of Friday should not be used by those like Ferguson to justify their racism. And so I bid adieu to the Doctor with [these wise words by Jon Stewart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2YK7pADmWU).\n\nThere is an enormous variety of books on the fall of Rome in the west. If you want a narrative, Adrian Goldsworthy's *How Rome Fell* is excellent, with a strong focus on political/military factors. Bryan ward-Perkins brought a new level of archaeological detail with his catastrophist position in *Fall of Rome* which has brought him to the forefront of the field. Peter Heather's *Empire and Barbarians* has become the go-to source on understanding the period from the perspective of those outside the frontier. Just as important, however, are continuities, and Peter Brown's *World of Late Antiquity* is still a wonderful and well written primer on them.\n\nNobody to my knowledge has compared the modern refugee situation to the Visigoths in an academic publication, perhaps because of how idiotic the notion is.",

        "text": "I've dedicated a considerable amount of time studying ancient African history in general and Kemet in particular. I've had debates and discussions on a wide range of topics with scholars who held different views on certain things, but **no topic seems to lower the level of discourse as quickly as Where the Kemetyu came from.**\n\nFrankly, I'm dumbfounded. Why has this topic become so hard to discuss even with people who seem otherwise reasonable? I am the first to agree that we still have a lot to learn about Kemetic civilization and anyone who's done a bit of studying on the topic can testify at how many times erroneous theories were held as fact just because the person making the claim had some sort of standing. \n\nHowever, we should all be able to agree that Kemet, which was an African civilization along the Nile river, was founded by Africans who of course were black. Even if we can debate and disagree on who invented what first, why is the very identity of ancient Egyptians perpetually put into question? They've left us writings, carvings and statues that confirm this fact, how the hell is this still a debate??\n\nThis is an honest question and I would hope that someone here would be able to enlighten me. I've searched the sub and only found partial answers, nothing clear nor concrete. \n\nIf you believe that Ancient Egyptians being black is bad history, could you please show me why? Who do you think founded this African civilization if it wasn't Africans (please don't say aliens) ? \n\n- **here's a documentary dealing with the black origins of Kemet and Nubia for reference**: [Ancient Africa's Golden times](https://youtu.be/xfRdmx8J_3g)\n\n- **here is the account of a Frenchman who went to Egypt and saw the truth**, Comte de Volney from his [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantin_Fran%C3%A7ois_de_Chasseb%C5%93uf,_comte_de_Volney):\n\n&gt; ''Just think, that this race of Black men, today our slave and the object of our scorn, is the very race to which we owe our arts, sciences, and even the use of speech! Just imagine, finally, that it is in the midst of people who call themselves the greatest friends of liberty and humanity that one has approved the most barbarous slavery, and questioned whether Black men have the same kind of intelligence as whites! \"In other words the ancient Egyptians were true Negroes of the same stock as all the autochthonous peoples of Africa and from the datum one sees how their race, after some centuries of mixing with the blood of Romans and Greeks, must have lost the full blackness of its original color but retained the impress of its original mould.''\n\n- And then there's the piece de resistance; the [Qustul Incense Burner](https://oi.uchicago.edu/museum-exhibits/nubia/qustul-incense-burner) which **comes from Ta Seti 3100 BCE, showing Nubians using Kemetic royal symbols in their art BEFORE the first Kemetic dynasty. This is the first recorded representation of the White crown of upper Egypt, it shows the crook and flail, the Falcon deity and much more.**\n\n- Out of the 32 Dynasties in Kemet, 25 of them were what we would today call Black.\n\n- [The Kemetic Table of Nations](http://manuampim.com/Images/Lepsius_4Groups.jpg) clearly shows that the Kemetyu saw themselves as black skinned Africans.\n\n- [Akhenaten Lookalikes](https://selfuni.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/akhenaten1.jpg) running around all over Sudan\n\n- [Beja People](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/fd/07/4a/fd074a9bc1fabfc5333359c67508313c.jpg) who still wear their hair like the 6th Dynasty did and look the same\n\n- [Queen Tiye](http://cobalt.rocky.edu/~mark.moak/tiye.jpg), mother of Akhenaten, had a glorious Afro and distinctively Negroid Features.\n\n- Great books that deal with this topic: \n\n[The Destruction of Black Civilization: Great Issues of a Race from 4500 B.C. to 2000 A.D.](https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Destruction_of_Black_Civilization.html?id=NWXwGAmIJ60C&amp;source=kp_cover&amp;hl=en) By Dr. Chancellor Williams. \n\n[Black Man of the Nile and His Family](https://books.google.ca/books?id=a7i-ngEACAAJ&amp;dq=the+black+man+of+the+nile&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAWoVChMIqrHhufaTyQIVwqYeCh3B0wFx) By the Legendary Dr. Yosef Ben Jochannan.\n\nThere is of course more material to be presented for discussion if needed, but mainly I want to hear from you guys, I wish to read what keeps you from accepting Kemet as an African civilization.\n\nIf the burden of proof is to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt then I think it might be hard to do given the date of this event. However, there is a preponderance of evidence which supports the claim that **Kemet was founded by what we would today call black people who came from Ta Seti, Nubia.** I have not seen anything presented that provides a stronger case for any other theory and no one has been able to dismiss the preponderance of evidence pointing to Black Africa.\n\nThe mental leaps and bounds required to believe Kemet was not founded by black people need more faith and imagination than I would expect from serious scholars on this issue.\n\n**edit: added links, spelling, corrections**\n",

        "text": "[An article about several lost civilizations.](https://michaelruark.wordpress.com/2015/08/17/10-civilizations-that-disappeared/) I haven't yet been to Australia, but the Aboriginal badhistory is by far the worst I've ever seen.\n\n&gt;Budj Bim, an archaeological site in southeast Australia, proves that this was not the case. For at least 6,700 years, the ancestors of the modern Gunditjmara people have lived here, along the edges of Lake Condah, in permanent dwellings made of wood, thatch, and volcanic rock. The Gunditjmara used irrigation, carving channels and damming streams to create a system of artificial wetlands at least a hundred square kilometers in area. In these wetlands, they raised eels and other fish, which they trapped in wooden baskets and used both for food and to trade with neighboring cultures. Today, Budj Bim is the only known pre-Colonial permanent settlement still in existence, thanks to the Gunditjmara’s dedication in preserving it. After nearly 200 years of combating European efforts to scatter them, at times through violent warfare, the Gunditjmara successfully won recognition for Budj Bim as a National Heritage site in 2004, and gained full legal title to their land in 2007. The discovery of ancient fish traps elsewhere in Australia, and early 19th century European accounts describing Aboriginal crop harvests and comparing the landscape to a well-tended “park,” indicate that Budj Bim may not always have been so unique. An agricultural lifestyle may have long been the norm rather than the exception.\n\nQuibble: The best evidence has this agrarian society lasting for [8,000](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/12/1047431096364.html) years, not 6,700.\n\nQuibble: While the fish traps have survived, the Gunditjmara have long since moved on to more modern houses.\n\n&gt;Some Aboriginal rock paintings reveal another historical first: large boats with high prows, suitable for deep ocean voyages. Images of such vessels, created between 15,000 and 22,000 years ago in northwest Australia, indicate that prehistoric Aborigines may have been advanced seafarers. According to mainstream theories, the first people to reach Australia came by land, traveling through Asia and island-hopping across the southeast Asian archipelagos during periods of low sea level. However, images of prehistoric boats have led several researchers to argue that the first Aborigines may actually have sailed directly from Africa instead. \n\nNope, nope, nope. There is little if any DNA evidence showing that Aborigines are any closer to Africans than other Asian/Pacific people. In fact, they are the *farthest* from Africans, along with Pacific Islanders.\n\n&gt;Additional evidence for this theory includes motifs common to Aboriginal and southern African art, and the presence of certain plants (such as baobob trees) on both continents. \n\nComparing art or architectural evidence [is not really good historiography.](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2v59vq/smashed_by_the_hammer_of_thor_some_viking/) By that standard, [Aborigines](http://iav.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Memmott-2.jpg) are related to [Galician Spaniards](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Palloza_en_O_Cebreiro_%28Lugo%29.JPG) and [Basotho](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Lesotho_Slide_Show_%28294%29.JPG) because their architecture uses similar motifs.\n\n&gt;Genetic data shows another cross-continental link: mixing with Indian populations 4-5,000 years ago.  If the DNA evidence is correct, it should be possible to find cultural evidence of interaction as well, such as Sanskrit loanwords in Aboriginal languages, or Australian motifs in Hindu mythology.\n\nThere is not evidence that the flow went both ways. Unless Indian Hindus had prophecies of Australia before even settling there or unless there was back-migration from India *to* Australia, there is no reason to find Australian motifs in Hinduism. \n\n&gt;If the African and Indian connections can be firmly substantiated, it would show that Australian Aborigines sailed the prehistoric oceans tens of thousands of years ago, and were perhaps even the first civilization on Earth.\n\nSo wait - you're calling these Africans and Indians Aborigines *before* they even set foot in Australia? Yay anachronisms!\n\nFurther down, in talking about Native Americans, there is more Aboriginal badhistory:\n\n&gt;Even more fascinating than their incredible cold tolerance is the Yaghans’ cultural legacy. Astonishingly, the Yaghans’ first ancestors may have been Australian Aborigines! According to Brazilian anthropologist Walter Neves, the earliest known human skulls in South America, from 12,000 to 6,000 years old, are similar to those of indigenous Australians. They do not resemble those of the Clovis people, who crossed into North America from Siberia via the Bering Land Bridge around 15,000 years ago, and are generally considered the ancestors of all indigenous New World peoples. \n\nNot anymore. [Pre-Clovis people have been accepted for years now.](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/science/25archeo.html?_r=0) \n\nAlso the DNA studies: Aboriginal DNA has been found in [Brazil](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dna-search-first-americans-links-amazon-indigenous-australians-180955976/?no-ist); there is nothing that I can find specifically singling out the Yaghan has having Aboriginal DNA more than any other indigenous South American. \n\n&gt;Circumstantial evidence that Australians may have reached South America first also includes bones painted with red ochre (like the Aboriginal Lake Mungo remains), and the rock shelters of Pedra Furada in Brazil, which contain stone artifacts dated as old as 60,000 years (roughly the same age as the first signs of human activity in Australia).\n\nAgain, finding a similar artistic motif in two very different cultures is not really evidence of much. Nor does the fact that two regions were inhabited at the same time mean that their populations are related. Also, [Pedra Furada is dated at the earliest at 40,000 BCE.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedra_Furada_sites)\n\n&gt;Among living South American Natives, the Yaghan and other peoples of Tierra del Fuego are the only ones to retain such Australoid features. \n\nNope. [Aboriginal features survive throughout Latin America.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australoid_race#Migration_to_the_Americas_hypothesis)\n\n&gt;DNA studies support Neves’ theory, showing a mixture of Siberian and Australian genetic markers among Fuegians. If Neves’ theory is correct, the implications are incredible: it means that more than 12,000 years ago, Australoid peoples either migrated through northern Asia and North America without leaving a trace, crossed the Pacific Ocean directly by boat, or island-hopped from Australia to Antarctica and then to South America. \n\nTheory #1 is not necessarily true; as I said earlier, hints of Aboriginal-looking peoples have been found as far north as Mexico. Theory #2 is [probably correct; there is evidence that it happened in the other direction.](http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/01/polynesians-reached-south-america-picked-up-sweet-potatoes-went-home/) Theory #3 is the stuff of Clive Cussler: *Antarctica??!!*\n\n&gt;The latter two theories may seem impossible. However, as we have previously shown, Australian Aborigines had ocean-going boats at least 15,000 years ago, and may even have sailed the Indian Ocean voyaging to and from Africa and India. \n\nThere is some evidence for the \"to\", particularly from India. Not much evidence of Aboriginal return migration. \n\n&gt;And if any premodern people can be imagined surviving an Antarctic migration, it would be the ancestors of the cold-resistant Yaghan. The idea that they descended from seafaring Australian explorers, while incredible, is consistent with the Yaghans’ own apparent feats of navigation. Arrowheads and a Yaghan boat have been discovered in the Falkland Islands 300 miles east of the Patagonian coast, while stone tools are reported from marine sediment samples from the South Shetland Islands. The South Shetland Islands lie some 500 miles south of Tierra del Fuego, but a mere 58 miles from the Antarctic mainland at their southernmost point! \n\nWhoa...\n\n&gt;It should be noted, however, that such artifacts may actually postdate European arrival, after which time Yaghan are known to have been hired or enslaved aboard their conquerors’ vessels.\n\nHeh. Nice work sneaking in the punchline.\n\n&gt;If these extraordinary theories are true, the Yaghan represent the farthest outpost of the ancient seafaring Australian culture discussed previously. Their ancestors would have been some of the most daring pioneers in human history: the first people ever to sail the Pacific Ocean, discover the New World, or possibly even set foot on the Antarctic coast, tens of thousands of years before any other human group would attempt the same. As for the living Yaghan, they are a unique and fascinating people no matter their origins, whom we may hope recover from their brutal decimation by Europeans and thrive again as a culture long into the future.\n\nSomewhere, an indigenous Brazilian with visible Aboriginal ancestry is crying.\n\nTL;DR: Antarctic Aborigines, yo. I still need to see some recognition for my Galicians-are-actually-displaced-Gunditjmara theory. ed: And yes, [Fidel Castro and Generalísimo Franco are paternally Galician and therefore Gunditjmara warriors.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Galician_people)",

        "text": "This turd bobbed passed on my Facebook feed this morning, posted by someone with a history of politically-loaded \"facts\".\n\nThe article in question is [A brief debunking of a list of top 20 Muslim inventions](http://faustasblog.com/2006/03/a-brief-debunking-of-a-list-of-top-20-muslim-inventions/) and the target of its ire is a 2009 newspaper article, [How Islamic Inventors Changed the World](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/how-islamic-inventors-changed-the-world-6106905.html).\n\nNow I don't give a Golden Age of Islam about the original list, but the 'debunking' raises my ire. I want to see a fellow BadHistorian gun down a whole squadron of errors before ducking behind the clouds, flashing me a grin and a cheery wave. What I got was worse than poor, what I got was block quotes from odious nightmare text [*The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (And the Crusades)*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0895260131/thebadhairblo-20/104-0604426-7120759?creative=327641&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;camp=14573&amp;adid=1J16Z4CJPD3V267XVVWN&amp;link_code=as1).\n\nMore than that, the author seems to be deliberately ignoring bits of the text they're \"debunking\" in order to construct a more fragile straw man which they can then pepper with buckshot from Robert Spencer's nonsense cannon.\n\n**Item #4, flying machines**\n\n&gt;&gt;A thousand years before the Wright brothers a Muslim poet, astronomer, musician and engineer named Abbas ibn Firnas made several attempts to construct a flying machine. \n\n&gt;As my friend used to say, trying isn’t the same thing as doing. Hundreds of people throughout the ages have died trying to fly while making “several attempts to construct a flying machine”, from Daedalus and Icarus down to some fool doing drugs in our times.\n\nThe bit of the Independent article that they chose not to quote says: \n\n&gt;In 875, aged 70, having perfected a machine of silk and eagles' feathers he tried again, jumping from a mountain. He flew to a significant height and stayed aloft for ten minutes but crashed on landing - concluding, correctly, that it was because he had not given his device a tail so it would stall on landing.\n\nOh... he DID successfully fly then? But that's more r/BadPendantry than r/BadHistory so far, the Independent article was on point here at least.\n\n**Item #10, medical science**\n\n&gt;&gt;In the 13th century, another Muslim medic named Ibn Nafis described the circulation of the blood, 300 years before William Harvey discovered it.\n\n&gt;In The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (And the Crusades) Robert Spencer explains (p. 93):\n\n&gt;&gt;Yet it was not a Muslim, but a Belgian physician and researcher, Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564), who paved the way for modern medical advances by publishing the first accurate description of human internal organs, *De Humanai Corporis Fabrica* (*On the Fabric of the Human Body*) in 1543. Why? Because Vesalius was able to dissect human bodies, while that practice was forbidden in Islam. What’s more, Vesalius’s book is filled with detailed anatomical drawings – but also forbidden in Islam are artistic representations of the human body.\n\n&gt;On page 91, Spencer states\n\n&gt;&gt;The first Arabic-language medical treatise was written by a Christian priest and translated into Arabic by a Jewish doctor in 683.\n\nThis is my favourite bit because it attempts to debunk something that happened in the 13th Century by mentioning something that happened in the 16th. This isn't a debunk, it transpires, just a petulant attempt to prove why good Western medicine trumps heathen desert medicine...\n\nFirstly, the Islamic prohibition on dissection and how that stymied The Chart:\n\nIt's true there were unlikely to have been any *human* dissections in the 13th Century Islamic world or earlier, but there's plenty of examples of animal dissection though and references to the study of corpses and the dissection of eyes. For example, [Yuhanna ibn Massuwayh dissected apes in the 9th Century](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H_O1HiEHdZsC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Yuhanna+ibn+Masawayh+dissection&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mLDMNdux5T&amp;sig=BgUGS-OrLbOamUJgIu8pyywgOIc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAmoVChMIvJig0ImNyQIVxbQaCh1zZwal#v=onepage&amp;q=Yuhanna%20ibn%20Masawayh%20dissection&amp;f=false) because of their similarity to men and Ibn Nafis most likely came to his extremely detailed conclusion about the circulatory system [based on animal dissections](http://www.ishim.net/ishimj/910/JISHIM%20NO.10%20PDF/01.pdf), so the argument isn't really working whichever way you tilt it. \n\nYes, he was unable to dissect humans to come to his incredible realisations about the circulatory system, but he definitely wasn't flying blind.\n\nSecondly, the Islamic prohibition on anatomical drawing and how that stymied The Chart:\n\nWell, there's the [spectacular example of *Mansur's Anatomy*](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/arabic/p19.html), composed by Persian physician Mansur ibn Ilyas in 1450, and regarded as the first colour atlas of the human body so we can assume that earlier depictions of anatomy may have existed. \n\nThis is possible because that widely cited prohibition against depicting the human form is actually [a prohibition human forms for purposes of worship, aka idolatry](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tA9Uuy2cSIcC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=human+forms+islamic+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAGoVChMIisrHhpmNyQIVCdkaCh0iMQY9#v=onepage&amp;q=human%20forms%20islamic%20art&amp;f=false), so while most art played it safe and stayed well away from depictions of people or animals - especially religious art - there are plenty of secular examples of human forms from the Islamic Golden Age and even a few depictions of the Prophet too.\n\nThen the Failed Debunker just gets mean-spirited and throws in a spot of cultural oneupmanship with asinine statements like \"The first Arabic-language medical treatise was written by a Christian priest and translated into Arabic by a Jewish doctor in 683,\" they should probably be aware that their medical trump card Vesalius first came to note with [his adaptation on the Arab-Persian *Liber ad Almansorem*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23752981) and used Arab words in his own medical writing.\n\n**Item #11, windmills** \n\n&gt;as noted in the article, another Persian invention.\n\nI quite like how this is dropped as if it were somehow definitive in itself, because the author has already established in an earlier (accurate) answer that Persian doesn't necessarily equal Islamic. Now insinuation can do all the work that research can't.\n\nMuch like the flying machines post the author leaves out a crucial part of the original article:\n\n&gt;The windmill was invented in 634 for a Persian caliph and was used to grind corn and draw up water for irrigation\n\nA CALIPH, you say? Most versions of the story (the first substantial mention of a windmill), suggest that [the windmill was made for Umar bin al-Khat'tab by a carpenter](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qEVsAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT147&amp;dq=umar+windmill&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI8K6EupCNyQIVBzgaCh39ZgQe#v=onepage&amp;q=umar%20windmill&amp;f=false). The definitely-Islamic Caliph Umar, by the way, is remembered for expanding the definitely-Islamic Rashidun Caliphate *into* Persia and crushing the Sasanian Empire. \n\nCreated for a Islamic ruler in a Islamic empire? Obviously we'd rather not be making definitive statements about things like this, but it's not a stretch to call it an Islamic invention, even though the carpenter Abu Lulu is described as non-Muslim. \n\nHowever, that probably doesn't matter because the story is probably a complete fiction. To put it into context the earliest widely accepted use of windmills comes from 10th Century Persia and there was a trend in the 10-11th Centuries toward aggrandising Persian accomplishments at the expense of the Arabs so we have to take this retelling of an earlier exchange with a pinch of salt, because it looks a little bit like one of those [old *Goodness Gracious Me* sketches about how everything is actually Indian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfpqfwt_cLg).\n\nWindmills could easily be a lot older than the 7th Century and there're definitely [enough](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4Oi70BovgoQC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=Heron+of+Alexandria+windmill&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMIqvDm7ZKNyQIVxrUaCh0Z8Qdv#v=onepage&amp;q=Heron%20of%20Alexandria%20windmill&amp;f=false) [accounts](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ws0AIfNabpYC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=Hammurabi+windmill&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAmoVChMI2aTe_5KNyQIVCx8aCh0U6AgZ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hammurabi%20windmill&amp;f=false) to throw doubt on the Independent's claim and yet somehow our Failed Debunker alighted at \"Persia # Islam\" and just stayed there.\n\nEven when they're right, they're wrong.\n\nThat'll do me for now. I've got work to do, but I might come back and go through the rest of the article. \n\nThis is my first submission, so be merciless and I'll try to hold back my tears. Unless you want to see tears, in which case I'll turn them on and hope the bullying stops. Just like Year 7 Biology.",

The bit we are interested in is this:\n\n&gt; The main gospels (Mark, Matthew, Luke and John) are basically copies of the first, Mark.\n\nThis is... sort of right?  It's certainly not *entirely* wrong.\n\nFirstly, the big, glaring error, is that *John* is *not* based off of the same source as the other three Gospels. It may have been written by the same author as the *Epistles of John* (or at least a subset of them: it's not certain that all three of the *Epistles* were even written by the same person, AFAIK), but basically we know very little about *John*'s sources.\n\nThe remaining three gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are known as the *synoptic gospels*, and all have many similarities to one another.  Exactly how they are related is still debated, but the most common opinion is, I believe, that there are two sources (*Mark* itself, and *Q*, from the German *Quelle*, meaning source).  So Luke and Matthew are both based off of Mark, but they also contain material of their own.  Two more sources, *L* and *M* (for *Luke* and *Matthew* respectively) have been suggested to explain the differences between Matthew and Luke. This is known as the *Four-Source Hypothesis*.  The *Two-Source Hypothesis* posits only *Q* and *Mark* as sources, with the *L* and *M* material either being invented by their respective authors or coming from different parts of *Q*.\n\nAdditionally, virtually every other conceivable explanation for the pattern of overlaps between Matthew, Mark, and Luke has been proposed at some point or other.  These range from \"the gospels were all composed independently\" to \"Luke was the primary source for Matthew which was the primary source for Mark (with each gospel drawing differing bits from an anthology, *A*, explaining the disagreements)\".\n\nThe comment concludes:\n\n&gt; There was an original gospel at one point but the bible does not look anything like it.\n\nAs I have (hopefully) demonstrated, this is false.  There were at least two original gospels at one point, Mark (or Luke, or Matthew, or proto-Mark/Luke/Matthew, but probably Mark) and John, plus *n* other sources which influenced the synoptic gospel tradition, where *n* is an integer.  To what extent the gospels as they are now resemble those that were originally written is not something I know enough about to comment on, but I suspect that the quote above overstates the case there, too.",

My wife and I have been watching the series with our 7 year old, and Sunday night we watched Back to the Future III. (As a side note, this was easily his most favorite of the three. I think it was a combination of it being a Western, with cowboys, Indians, gun fights, and also the fact that it had the simplest plot of the three.) \n\nAbout half way through the film there's a scene where Clara and Doc are looking at the stars through her newly repaired telescope. \n\n**Clara**: \"Emmett, do you think we’ll ever be able to travel to the moon the way we travel across the country on trains?\"\n\n**Doc**: \"Definitely, although not for another 84 years, and not on trains. We’ll have space vehicles, capsules sent aloft on rockets, devices that create giant explosions, explosions so powerful that they….\"\n\n**Clara**: \"...that they break the pull of the Earth’s gravity and send the projectile through outer space. Emmett! I read that book too. You’re quoting Jules Verne, *From the Earth to the Moon*.\"\n\n*From Earth to the Moon* is about a group of American inventors who try to build a space gun to fire a projectile into space to reach the moon. There's really nothing in it about space vehicles, capsules, rockets, etc. \n\nThe conversation continues:\n\n**Doc**: \"You've read Jules Verne?\"\n\n**Clara Clayton**: \"I *adore* Jules Verne.\"\n\n**Doc**: \"So do I. *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea*, my absolute favorite. The first time I read that when I was a little boy I wanted to meet Captain Nemo and...\"\n\n**Clara Clayton**: [laughs] \"Don't tease, Emmett. You couldn't have read that when you were a little boy, it was only first published ten years ago.\"\n\nWe know that this is September, 1885. *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* was actually first published in serialized form from 1869 to 1870. It was published in an illustrated version 1871 and the first English translation was completed in 1873. \n\nSo whether she meant that it was first published in book form \"ten years ago\", or in English \"ten years ago\", she would be incorrect either way. \n\n(And don't get me started on the totally inappropriate clothing, or the fact that there were no Indian Wars in Arizona in 1885, or the fact that the \"Indians\" in the opening scene were actually using stirrups!)",

Got Wrong\".\n\nAs per usual, Cracked gets its history wrong.  I'm going to focus on their interpretation of *Alice in Wonderland* here, but the problems with their interpretation of Machiavelli are covered in Tiako's post.  I don't know enough about any of the other books to comment (though I will note that Elisabeth Nietzsche cannot possibly have married a Nazi in 1885, seeing as the NSDAP wasn't founded until 1920), so I'm going to concentrate on the history of *Alice in Wonderland*.\n\nTo give Cracked credit where it is due, *Alice* is *not* about LSD -- as should be obvious, considering that LSD wasn't synthesised until 1938, long after *Alice* was first published. Nor is it about any other hallucinogen. \n\nHowever, pretty much everything else in this section is bunk.\n\n&gt; Dodgson was old school when it came to math, because right up until his time, math professors still taught from a 2,000-year-old textbook. \n\nIt is true that mathematics in Victorian England still used Euclid's *Elements* to teach Euclidean geometry (as W.W. Rouse Ball wrote, \"the fact that for two thousand years [the Elements] was the usual text-book on the subject raises a strong presumption that it is not unsuitable for that purpose.\"), it's misleading to suggest that all mathematics taught in England when *Alice* was written was 2,000 years out of date.  Non-Euclidean geometry, for instance, was by this point widely accepted amongst mathematicians.  Indeed, the term \"non-Euclidean geometry\" was coined by Carl Gauss, who died ~more than 100 years~ before *Alice* was published.  Other more modern (relative to Euclid, at least) areas in mathematics well established by Carroll's time include calculus (developed by Newton and Leibniz), logarithms (John Napier), Cartesian coordinates (Rene Descartes), decimal notation, graph theory (Euler), and probability (Pascal).  Carroll's mathematics may have been \"old school\", but it certainly wasn't all 2,000 years old, as Cracked seems to imply.\n\n&gt; What incensed Dodgson was that math no longer had any real-world grounding. He knew that you could add two apples to three apples to get five apples, but once you start thinking about the square root of -1 apples, you're living on the moon. The Rev. Dodgson thought the new mathematics was completely absurd, like something you'd dream up if you were on drugs.\n\nImaginary numbers were hardly \"new mathematics\" by Carroll's time.  Euler introduced the now-familiar \"i\" notation, and even earlier than that Descartes coined the name \"imaginary number\" in *1637*, almost two centuries before Carroll was even born.\n\n(More into the bad mathematics side of things, Euclidean geometry is not really something with \"real world grounding\", as space is non-Euclidean (though to be fair, Carroll didn't know this as it was only proved by Einstein after his death...))\n\n&gt; So he decided to write a book about a world that followed the laws of abstract mathematics, purely to point out the batshit lunacy of it.\n\nThe origins of *Alice* are well known, and nothing to do with what is described here. The story in fact began \"All in the golden afternoon\" in 1862, when Carroll, Robinson Duckworth, and the three Liddell sisters, went on a rowing expedition on the Thames. Carroll's diary records (in an addendum seven months later) that this was the first occasion that he told the story of *Alice*.  Alice Liddell and Robinson Duckworth both confirmed this version of events in their writings. The story was first written down on the request of Alice Liddell.  *Alice* does contain mathematical and logical allusions and jokes, but it certainly did not originate as a satire on modern mathematics.\n\n(Here I digress to quote an excellent piece of badhistorical research, quite up to our own standards, quoted by Martin Gardner in his *Annotated Alice*:\n\n&gt; It is with sadness I add that when a check was made in 1950 with the London meteorological office (as reported in Helmut Gernsheim's *Lewis Carroll: Photographer*) records indicated that the weather near Oxford on July 4, 1862, was \"cool and rather wet.\" There is little likelihood that this is wrong. Nor is it possible that Carroll incorrectly dated his entry about the trip to Godstow, for his diary has an entry for every day of the week in question. The most probable explanation of these depressing facts is that Carroll, and later both Duckworth and Alice, confused the memorable day with sunnier occasions on which similar boating trips were made and similar stories told.\n\n)\n\nThe idea that *Alice* is a satire of modern mathematics appears to be put forward by Melanie Bayley (whose article is linked by Cracked) and not a single other person.  One could equally well find articles to support all sorts of absurd interpretations of *Alice*. That doesn't make it true.\n\nEdit: I was a century out on Gauss' dates, somehow.",

        "text": "In a thread that was locked for race-baiting, about two people who were beat up over a Confederate flag decal, one expects some stinkers - and I know the Lost Cause is far, far overdone here - but it's no-moratorium November, and I found [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/3rnyu6/2_men_jumped_over_confederate_flag_on_pickup/cwpxwej?context=10) extraordinarily stinky - both for the claim itself (which is new to me) and the amount of bad history it crams into two lines.\n\nFirst, one has to assume that 'repatriating slaves' refers here to sending slaves back to slavery in the South, rather than to Liberia or other places in Africa (as the term is generally used in this context), because the idea that the North was repatriating slaves (in the latter sense) to any noticeable extent, or that *not* sending slaves to Africa would have stopped slavery, is ludicrous.  (Somewhat ironically, many Southern whites *were* supporters of 'repatriation', seeing it as [a solution to the 'problem' of free blacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Liberia#Growing_numbers_of_free_blacks).)  I'm not certain how annoyed to be by the implication that the South was the homeland of escaped slaves, but that's really the shit cherry on top of the whole banana split of douchery that is this comment.\n\nSo we can rephrase this claim:  \"the North could have stopped slavery if they wanted by not sending slaves back to the South.  They just didn't like black people enough for that.  They would rather have had a war than live next to runaway slaves.\"\n\nWhat.  \n\nNo, seriously, what.\n\nDoes this commenter just not know about the [Fugitive Slave Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850)?  And how Northern states tried, repeatedly, to [subvert or nullify them via personal liberty laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_liberty_laws), so that they wouldn't *have* to send runaway slaves back to their masters?  Does he realize that Southern demands for Northerners to return slaves so infuriated the North that it [encouraged Northerners to fight for bans on slavery in new territories](http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3276) and materially contributed to the rise of the anti-slavery Republican Party and the election of Abraham Lincoln?  Does he also realize, more to the point, that Northerners *not* wanting to 'repatriate' slaves was one of the grievances listed by [South Carolina in its declaration of secession](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_scarsec.asp), and, in general, one of the fundamental *causes* of secession and thus the Civil War?  Do I ask too many rhetorical questions with obvious answers?\n\nSo we can rephrase this claim again:  \"the North could have stopped slavery, if they wanted, by doing what many Northern states really, really wanted to do, what the South used Federal law to prevent them from doing, and what, ultimately, the South seceded to prevent the North from doing.\"\n\nBut let's consider a hypothetical where, despite all the problems involved, the North, as a whole, decided to 'not repatriate slaves', flip the bird to the Fugitive Slave Acts, declared that all black people entering a free state were free, and encouraged slaves and free blacks to come north... and this would have ended slavery and avoided war?  In real history, the South was *infuriated* that Northern states were asserting states' rights and defying Federal authority by passing personal liberty laws - doing more of this is going to lead to peace?  Being more assertive on the subject of freedom for slaves is going to convince the South to stay in the Union and quietly accept the eminently predictable and rapidly approaching minority status of slave states in the Federal government?  I don't think even Harry Turtledove would buy that one.\n\nSo we can rephrase this claim yet again:  \"the North could have stopped slavery, if they wanted, by doing more of the things that caused the South to secede and attack Fort Sumter.\"\n\nYeah.  Definitely.",

Lets begin, shall we?\n\nThis post will be about [this video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhPxxbIrJUE), made by some teenagers for their AP History project on the Columbian Exchange.\n\nWithin an astounding seven seconds the video commits several crimes against history including, but not limited to:\n\n1. Ignoring the other two ships brought by Columbus during the first expedition (The Pinta and Nina)\n\n2. A much more northern route than what was [actually taken] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus#/media/File:Viajes_de_colon_en.svg)\n\n3. A ship that in no way resembles what was actually sailed (Model shown [here] (http://densmodelships.com/files/Model_Ship_Store/Santa_Maria_0.jpg))\n\n&gt; **0:19** I don’t know what you’re saying, man. This is the Caribbean. My name is Jack Swallow. *puts of pirate hat*\n\nWhile I can appreciate a Pirates of the Caribbean reference, the fact of the matter is that there were no pirates in the area at the time as it was unknown to any Europeans at the time (the exception being Columbus and his crew) and that there is no evidence of natives of the Caribbean engaging in piracy, leaving the region sadly devoid of rum and/or sea shanties. Many are also quick to point out that there was a distinct lack of small, plastic hats available during this period, which leads some historians to name that this infamous period “The Great Age of Hatlessness.”\n\n&gt; **0:25** My name is Christopher Columbus. I’m a Spanish explorer…\n\nOkay, we all know that Columbus was from Genoa, not Spain. But maybe I’ll give the kid some slack, maybe he meant to say he was an explorer *for* Spain\n\n&gt;... and I work for the Portuguese\n\nNevermind.\n\n&gt;**1:00** Hey man, you look like you’re working really hard. Wanna go on a cruise? I’m going for a w-world caribbean cruises.\n\nAh, yes. This tactic is commonly known as the “Hey kids, any of you want some ice cream?” method of enslavement. Its use and effectiveness was essentially non-existent but was, to quote one captain, “Hell of a lot more more fun than just buyin’ the suckers.”\n\n&gt; **1:43** I hope I’m not a slave. I better be the 10% that survives.\n\nAbout [85%] (https://www.boundless.com/u-s-history/textbooks/boundless-u-s-history-textbook/slavery-freedom-and-the-struggle-for-empire-1750-1763-5/slavery-in-the-colonies-55/the-middle-passage-338-6365/) of all slaves survived the Middle Passage. If only 10% of your slaves survived all your journeys, not only would you be a really shitty person, you would also be a really awful businessman. Slaves are expensive, yo.\n\n&gt; **3:27**-**4:24**\n\nThe obvious badhistory in this section is the use of an assault rifle (M-16?) roughly 400-450 years before it was actually invented. I will however give them bonus points for the giant Cheech-and-Chong-esque cigarette simply on the basis that it amuses me.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I was a bit lazy yesterday with the last bits of the siege because I couldn't be arsed to get the DVD from the living room and just used the small YouTube clip to do the whole review. But some of the questions were interesting enough for me to get it this time and I'm going to correct one scene while closing out on this film at the same time. BTW I'd recommend the film to others wanting to take a stab at other bits of bad history. There's a huge one around how the Magna Carta came about. There are ill-disguised WWII landing craft used by the French. The armour used by the knights is a bit off. Some of the weapons are way too modern. And what really happened between King John and King Philip II of France. And most of all of course the question will Mark Strong ever play a nice guy again in the future, or is his role in Kingsmen a once off?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Day Two : Ramming Speed!**\n\nThis part I couldn't find on Youtube, so I guess I have to be a bit more descriptive. We start day two with preparations to take the castle. The ram is wheeled up to the gates which are still smouldering a bit from yesterday's Level 8 Fireball. The portcullis is mostly gone, only the sides remain. The ram touches the gate once, king Richard rides up to the gates, catching arrows on his shield for no reason except to scare the crap out of his horse and bodyguard I guess. And then we cut to what probably is the most ridiculous scene in the whole film. Right as their castle is about to be overrun, a cook walks up the stairs with soup and everyone takes a break. \"Bien sûr, those dastardly English won't attack while we're mange le soupe?\" seems to be the thinking here. Le cook has a look to see how things are going now that he has distracted all the French defenders, and promptly has to dodge three arrows, nearly killing him. At that point the bar on the gate breaks and the doors open. The cook is incensed at such bad table manners, grabs a crossbow, and promptly shoots king Richard in the neck, fatally wounding him.\n\nWhile all the stuff was going on I counted the ram strokes and estimate that the door broke open after about ten of them. Now I give it some leeway for being damaged by the fire, but that's still a pretty piss-poor performance for a castle gate. Attackers have been know to give up on some gates simply because the ram couldn't make any headway against it. And this is probably going to be a recurring theme in future reviews because the castle gates in films are always notoriously flimsy. While the ram is shown hitting it in a few shots, you can see the whole gate flex like it's some cheap garden gate that's being hit. At hit number 10 the bar, which isn't particularly impressive, just snaps and the doors fling wide open. It also very briefly shows the gate itself which is a single layer of wooden planks. \n\nIn reality people knew perfectly well that fixing the gate in place as much as possible, so it wouldn't flex, was of key importance. So gates followed a number of key construction methods: \n\n* Layers. A gate was never just one layer of wood; like plywood, it gained a lot of its strength from having at least two layers of wood. The layers were of course put perpendicular to each other. A good example is [this picture of the old city gate of Valencia](http://i.imgur.com/AidsMlI.jpg) (warning, it's fairly big).\n* The way the wood was joined together. [This close-up of the same gate](http://i.imgur.com/c03eCrt.jpg) (sorry, just as big) shows how the two layers are kept as tightly packed together as possible with hundreds of rivets. The rivets would be driven through and closed while hot, so as the iron cools down, it shrinks and tightens, forcing the layers even closer together. There are also all sorts of iron reinforcement bars encircling the door at various spots, reinforcing the hinge points and the areas most likely to get hit with a ram. This door doesn't have them, but sometimes the door has iron strips under the rivets which form bands of additional reinforcement. In extreme cases this could be a [layer of metal covering the whole door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_fortification#/media/File:Horezu_oak_Reinforced_door.JPG).\n* The door fits tightly against the outside arch, so if it's closed, it can't really flex much outwards. If you look at the first picture you can see that the arch outside the door is smaller than the door itself. Firstly this of course protects the hinges, but it also stops outwards flexing when the door is barred. BTW it's also showing the portcullis guide slots on the sides of the wall in front of the gate.\n* Bars. There's usually at least one wooden bar running the whole length of both doors. Sometimes more than one, but never as many as in Hogwarts. The bar is held tight against the door with metal loops, and both ends sit in holes in the walls next to the gate. And unlike most bars shown in films, they're very thick, very sturdy square beams, and usually a whole tree trunk of an older tree is used because this is much stronger than an equal sized plank (something to do with the growth rings, can't remember the specifics). \n* Vertical bars (these weren't always used). These slide down vertically into a hole in the ground or ceiling and are fixed to the door near the centre. They're designed to stop flexing in the middle of the door, but are generally not as big as you'd expect them to be, but are usually made of solid metal.\n\nIn addition to this you can add temporary bracing behind the door, do fun stuff with the ram itself (they should be right under the murder holes), hot stuff is a classic, but you could also do things like catching the head with a rope and pulling it up, or dropping something soft between the ram and the door just before it hits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere is one more siege like scene later in the film where the sneaky bad guys attack a town called Barnsdale, but that's hardly a siege. They use two horses to kick down the gate. Yes, really - a big town gate -&gt; two horses. The gate is so flimsy, it makes you wonder why they bother closing it at all. This is so nonsensical I'm not going to cover it.\n\nIf you've read this far, thanks for hanging in there. Another thank you to the anonymous gold donater from yesterday. I was flattered and pleased as punch.\n\nNext week I'll hopefully cover Kingdom of Heaven. I've just rewatched the siege part, and it's a nice long part with lots of stuff to cover. Trebuchets, Siegetowers, and Ballistas, oh my!\n\n\n",

        "text": "I'm a bit of a castle fanatic so whenever one of them shows up in a film, especially in a siege setting, I sit up and start paying attention. In case of the sieges usually in anticipation of how badly it's going to be misrepresented. Maybe I make this into a series, but for now today's choice is Ridley Scott's \"Robin Hood\" (which wasn't really that bad of a film, despite all the bad history in it. Sort of Sommersby meets Magna Carta meets Saving Private Ryan).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Siege of Château de Châlus-Chabrol** \n\n[The opening scene starts with a siege somewhere in the mid-west of France](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n75PgMSxAOw). We find out that king Richard is plundering castles left, right, and centre to make up for the massive ransom his brother had to round up after he managed to get himself captured in Austria after coming back from the crusades (3rd in his case). In reality he was trying to undo the damage John did to the French possessions while he was locked up. And in this case deal with the rebellious viscount of Limoges.  \n\n**Frenchies on the wall:**\n\nNot a bad start, only two seconds in and the first piece of bad history is already there (technically it's probably right at the start with the suspiciously flat looking English bows, but that's not the subject I'm covering). We see three merry Frenchmen poking their crossbows over the battlements, with one of them having both of the crossbow's arms sticking out in front of the wall. He gets immediately punished by our plucky English archer for doing dumb things. Shooting a crossbow like that is pretty silly since you're ignoring all the nice bits the castle builder put there to keep you alive. Unless we're using a thin-walled 19th century romantic fake castle here, it's also extremely awkward and dangerous since the embrasures slope down and that wall is still pretty thick. So even if you don't get shot for your stupidity, you might just slide down and fall. [The best firing position would be to keep the weapon entirely inside the wall](http://i.imgur.com/wjgDru1.jpg). That also goes for any bowmen you might see on castle walls. So survival tip 1: For safety reasons keep your weapon within the wall at all times and always reload while hiding behind a merlon. \n\nBTW if you're not familiar with the terminology: battlements = the wall protecting the people on the wall, which are always crenelated = the gap toothed bits along the wall, with merlons being the tall bits, and crenels or embrasures being the spaces in between the merlons. If it doesn't have the crenelations, the protective wall is called a parapet. The complete wall section between the two towers is called a curtain wall.\n\nThe three all suffer from the common film depiction of battlements not covering half as much of a defender as it would in real life, with the guy on the right most certainly using a booster step to expose himself a bit more. Now the battlement's height differs between castles, but often tends to be around waist to midriff height with the merlons generally being about as tall as a fairly tall man. If you see much lower ones, you're probably looking at an 19th century imitation castle. \n\nIn this case the castle used in this scene doesn't exist and [was built for the film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood_(2010_film\\)#/media/File:Bourne_Wood_Movie_Castle.jpg) (pretty much on the same spot as Scott filmed the opening battle for Gladiator!), which explains a few more bad history bits in just the first shot: \n\n* the bar running over the merlons is not good for anything. Normally this would have shutters hanging from it that close off a good bit of the embrasure as shown in the picture above. These were pretty effective against stopping attaching archers shooting you, because of the arch the arrow had to be shot at to hit you on top of those walls. These were not always used, but the bar wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the shutters, so I don't know what they did with them. Build a wooden rabbit? Safety tip 2: battlement shutters are there to safe your live, don't take them away for any reason.\n* the tower behind them has corbels (the bits which allows the top bit to be wider than the bottom). The main defensive reason for this is to cover one of the main problems with castle walls in general: it's really hard to shoot someone once they've reached the base of the wall. If you were to run up to the base of the wall of the three French archers, they basically have no way to hit you except by tossing rocks over the wall in the hope they'll hit something. The arrow slits in the tower next to the wall are alleviating this gap in the defence by usually having at least a few set up to cover the base of the adjoining wall with enfilading fire. But of course if would be better if you could look straight down from the wall itself. And that's where corbelling comes in because by jutting the top part out from the wall, you can create holes looking straight down, while not compromising the defence the wall offers. Those are called machicolations and [you can see some here from the Antwerp castle called \"Het Steen\"](http://i.imgur.com/R6DbHCc.jpg). Problem is, our French tower doesn't have those holes, so the corbelling is purely decorative which is pretty unusual for corbels of that size and the time the siege is happening (1199). BTW despite it's silly name \"the Stone (castle)\", [that castle is impressive and worth a visit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Het_Steen). Safety tip 3: don't forget to build the machicolations in your towers.\n* As an aside, if those were meant to look like they were machicolations, it would have been a bit early for French castles in 1199 to already have them, there were an innovation brought back from the Crusades and we don't really start to see them appear in France until the 1220s or so. Richard himself incorporated them in [Château Gaillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_Gaillard) in 1196, but that was a brand new castle. Using [hoardings](http://i.imgur.com/VdrPwYC.jpg) would have been more appropriate. BTW that picture is from Carcassonne, France. Also very much worth visiting, just not in the main tourist season. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Pot o' Oil**\n\nFour seconds in (mother of gods, this film is going to take a small book to cover...) we see the classical pot of boiling oil being prepared for the attackers. Except they're not really classic at all. Oil was rare and very expensive and wouldn't have been used in sieges very often. It was used in 1428 against the English at Orleans but that will be a different film I think. It's just as effective to boil some water or heat up sand, or alternatively heat up pitch, animal fat (although you want to keep that since it's calorie dense food), or use quicklime (an early form of chemical warfare).\n\n**A Siege Horse?**\n\nRichard, who looks a fair bit older than 42, is galloping around on a horse to... I don't know. Shout at people? The use of cavalry is pretty limited in a siege and it would have been a bit silly to ride around, offering your horse up to the crossbow gods. In reality Richard was walking at this point in the siege (which didn't happen like this at all, but more about that later).\n\nAt [0:12](https://youtu.be/n75PgMSxAOw?t=12) we get a perfect shot that shows how incredibly hard it would have been to hit anyone on the wall. Even the arrow that manages to clear the merlons, would have flown harmlessly over the heads of the defenders because of the angle it was shot at. Unless your opponent conveniently sticks their head out as these guys are wont to do.\n\n**[continued below]**\n",

        "text": "Whenever the question of what form of bad history is the most annoying comes up, the most common answer is invariably something like Holocaust denial or colonialism apologia or the Lost Cause, which is all well and good but has the deep flaw that it is actually consequential. For me, the truly worst bad history is none of these, but rather the misrepresentation of Machiavelli's political thought.\n\nThe misunderstanding of Machiavelli is about as old as Machiavelli himself. In Elizabethan theater, for example, one of the stock characters was the \"Machiavel\" who was basically a scheming villain: In Christopher Marlowe's *Jew of Malta* the Machiavel says \"I count religion but a childish toy/ And hold there is no sin but ignorance\" which is a pretty surface understanding of Machiavelli's views (Like most humanists, he would probably be best described as a heterodox Christian, although I don't know if he ever actually discussed his views. The Church naturally banned his books but he was not for heresy). This was partially because his thought was blamed for the actions of Caterina de Medici during the Wars of Religion, even though they were about as far from his prescriptions as possible. The idea that he was a satirist, which is the main focus here, as far as I can tell arose during the Enlightenment, and was championed by Rousseau and Diderot, among others.\n\nOddly enough during his lifetime these misinterpretations were not very common, at least among his correspondents. His friend and contemporary Guicciardini, who would probably be as famous as Machiavelli if there was no Machiavelli, may have disagreed with him but never misinterpreted him (his correspondence on the Discourses is worth looking at). The political elite viewed him with respect and caution, which is probably fair. I suspect in the environment of fifteenth and sixteenth century Florence his ideas simply weren't that radical. Anyway.\n\nThe topic post was \"What are Machiavellian tactics\" which, sure as anything, led to [this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3rzino/people_talk_about_machiavellian_tactics_what_is/cwsssbs). And others:\n\n&gt;Threadly reminder that he wrote the Prince as satire.\n\n|\n\n&gt;It's interesting because my understanding is almost all other writings by Machiavelli are concerned with altruism, or something to that effect. He is essentially known for a piece of satire that everyone took seriously.\n\n|\n\n&gt;There's an argument to be made that he was a fairly sophisticated 16th century Stephen Colbert (pre-CBS edition), and we've spent 500 years accidentally reading his satirical masterwork as a serious piece.\n\n\nWas *The Prince* satire? Short answer: no. Long answer: NOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Longer answer:\n\n&gt;When evening comes, I return home and enter my study; on the threshold I take off my workday clothes, covered with mud and dirt, and put on the garments of court and palace. Fitted out appropriately, I step inside the venerable courts of the ancients, where, solicitously received by them, I nourish myself on that food that alone is mine and for which I was born; where I am unashamed to converse with them and to question them about the motives for their actions, and they, out of their human kindness, answer me. And for four hours at a time I feel no boredom, I forget all my troubles, I do not dread poverty, and I am not terrified by death. I absorb myself into them completely. And because Dante says that no one understands anything unless he retains what he has understood, **I have jotted down what I have profited from in their conversation and composed a short study, De principatibus, in which I delve as deeply as I can into the ideas concerning this topic, discussing the definition of a princedom, the categories of princedoms, how they are acquired, how they are retained, and why they are lost.**And if ever any whimsy of mine has given you pleasure, this one should not displease you. It ought to be welcomed by a prince, and especially by a new prince; therefore I am dedicating it to His Magnificence Giuliano. Filippo da Casavecchia has seen it. He will be able to give you some account of both the work itself and the discussions I have had with him about it, although I am continually fattening and currying it.\n\nMachiavelli, as it turned out, was quite the letter writer, and this is from his letter to Francesco Vettori, a Florentine diplomat who is mostly famous for being the subject of this letter. This is how Machiavelli himself describes *The Prince*, not as a satire or anything like it, but as the accumulation of his knowledge and the result of deep and careful study. It would require quite a bit of evidence to argue against what the man himself said, and this evidence usually comes in this form:\n\n&gt;He was describing the real world actions of the Medeci. The man himself was a staunch and lifelong republican, and wanted to do away with the fuedal aristocrats.\n\nLeaving aside the bit about feudal aristocrats (which is partially true but irrelevant, most Italian aristocrats probably preferred republicanism), what about the famous dissonance between *The Prince*, which describes how to be an effective tyrant (sort of), and *The Discourses*, which is about what makes republics succesful or unsuccessful? Once again, this is a difficulty that is pretty easy to solve by actually reading Machiavelli, specifically *Discourses* I.IX:\n\n&gt;And it may appear perhaps to some that I have gone too far into Roman history, not having yet made any mention of the organizers of this Republic, or of (having regard for) her institutions, her religion, and her military establishment. And therefore, not wanting to keep in suspense the minds of those who want to understand these matters, I say, that many perhaps should judge it a bad example that the founder of a civil society, as Romulus was, should first have killed his brother, then have consented to the death of Titus Tatius, a Sabine, who had been chosen by him to share the Kingdom; because of which it might be judged that the citizens could, from ambition and the desire to rule, with the authority of their Prince, attack those who should be opposed to their authority. Which opinion would be correct, if the object he had in mind in causing that homicide should be considered. **But this must be assumed, as a general rule, that it never or rarely occurs that some Republic or Kingdom is well organized from the beginning, or its institutions entirely reformed a new, unless it is arranged by one (individual only): rather it is necessary that the only one who carries it out should be he who on whose mind such an organization depends. A prudent Organizer of a Republic, therefore, who has in mind to want to promote, not himself, but the common good, and not his own succession but his (common) country, ought to endeavor to have the authority alone: and a wise planner will never reprimand anyone for any extraordinary activity that he should employ either in the establishment of a Kingdom or in constituting a Republic.** It is well then, when the deed accuses him, the result should excuse him; and when it is good, as that of Romulus, he will always be excused; for he ought to be reprehended who is violent in order to destroy, and not he who does so for beneficial reasons. He ought, however, to be so prudent and wise that the authority which he has assumed, he will not leave to his heirs (or) any other: for men being more prone to evil than to good, his successor could employ for reasons of ambition that which should be employed for virtuous reasons by him. In addition to this, even if one is adept at organizing, the thing organized will not endure long if its (administration) remains only on the shoulders of one individual, but it is good when it remains in the care of many, and thus there will be many to sustain it. As the organization of anything cannot be made by many because of the diverse opinions that exist among them, yet having once understood this, they will not agree to forego it. And that Romulus merited to be excused for the death of his brother and that of his companion, and that what he had done he did for the common good and not for his own ambition, is shown by his immediate institution of a Senate with which he should consult, and according to the opinions of which he would make his decision. And whoever considers well the authority which Romulus reserved for himself, will see that he did not reserve anything else other than the command of the army when war was decided upon, and of convening the Senate. This was seen at that time when Rome became free after the driving out of the Tarquins, where there was no other innovation made on the ancient institutions except that in place of an hereditary King there should be two Consuls (elected) each year. Which gives testimony that all the institutions at the origin of that City were more in conformity with a free and civil society than with an absolute and tyrannical one.\n\nI could now post examples that show Machiavelli believed that new institutions, a fresh start, and a refoundation of Italy was neccesary, but that would require me to post pretty much every word he wrote, because that was basically his whole deal. His belief, repeated again and again, is that Italy was corrupt and that good laws and good institutions were neccesary to instill the \"virtue\" neccesary to save it. And in order to have these laws and institutions you needed a founder, someone who could, perhaps, be described as a *prince*. (Quick note, the title \"De principatibus\", which is an alternative to Il Principe, literally translates to \"concerning principalities\").\n\nIt never fails to amaze me how often this argument gets repeated with reference to nothing but his biography and a general sense that he was \"republican\". Speaking if biography:\n\n&gt;The Prince was essentially a commissioned piece. He wrote it for a Medici in order to ingratiate himself with them after falling out of favour, whereas he himself had a more populist streak.\n\nPartially true. The Prince was dedicated to one of the Medici, I think Lorenzo (not the Magnificent) in hopes of getting noticed for a job, but it wasn't commissioned, unlike the *Florentine Histories*. Further reading can be found in the little introductory bit of any translation.\n\nAlso just a quick note: Machiavelli will often be described as a minor and insignificant politician before he was kicked out, leading him to turn to writing. But in reality, he was secretary to the Second Chancery during the republic, essentially the right hand man of Piero Soderini, the Gonfaloniere for life, which was essentially the leader. He was appointed ambassador to several Germans states, France, and the Romagna under Cesere Borgia and was a moderately succesful military reformer and leader. He was also an acclaimed playwright and a widely respected intellectual in Florence. He was a pretty important figure in his own lifetime as well as a massively important thinker. They don't bury just anybody in Santa Croce.\n\nThere are roughly a billion books on him, but seriously, if you want to understand *The Prince* just read the thing.",

When you use the word *always* you're speaking in absolutes, and when history is considered that is well, *never* a good idea. History is messy and ugly and at times confusing as to *who the victors even are.* And I find it pretty ironic that someone who is investigating narratives with a suspicious eye would ascribe to such a notion.\n\n&gt;It's almost as though we must believe, as humans, that the good guys always win. So whoever wins, is always the good guys. The bigger the conflict, the bigger the winning heroes and the more demonized the losers are. Statistically, it seems unlikely that the good guys (as though both sides couldn't be evil) win ever single time.\n\nAgain, no. While it's true that there will definitely be pre-packaged perceptions of a country's involvement in certain wars delivered unto their populace as propaganda or even as part of their educational curriculum, it's absurd to say that they will all be positive. I have a strong feeling this comment is written by an American, not just because of the references but also because of the myopic view of American History. This type of worldview really does seem to be shared by the most nominally educated citizens of the Evil Empire, and while that myopia can be considered at least in part a product of the US education system, and by extension the product of the US's alleged proclivity toward blind patriotism, you can't proclaim every nation on Earth to be a propaganda state- especially America.\n\nShit, take the Second Iraq War for example. We won a decisive victory against Saddam's forces in a matter of days. Now was there a wholesale demonization of Saddam Hussein and the Ba'ath Party? Yes. But to say that the war's history was white washed by America propaganda is absolutely absurd. [If anything, the US \"victory\" was about as pyrrhic as could be according to nearly everyone involved.](http://militaryhistorynow.com/2013/03/20/with-triumphs-like-these-who-needs-defeats-a-brief-history-of-pyrrhic-victories/)\n\n&gt;After WWII, we are then told that tens of thousands of people got together and rounded up other people so they could exterminate them from existence. As a person, it's seems very unlikely that so many people could be convinced to blindly commit such an atrocity, yet it's actually a criminal act to even question that it happened in certain places in the world.\n\nI'm not sure what he's referring to here, and there's no source given.\n\n&gt;In reality, the US was locking up Japanese in internment camps no different than Germany was locking up it's enemies. The only difference is that the US was winning the war and had the ability to continue to care for the people in it's camps.\n\nLook, far be it from me to say that the Japanese Americans had it easy in the internment camps, they did not. But this statement is absurd.\n\nThe examples of why this is an asinine statement are plentiful, but I'll just list a few:\n\n- The Japanese had legal recourse. [They successfully fought the legality of the camps and won their release in December of 1944](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/323/214/). The German Enemies of the State weren't afforded such rights.\n\n- The conditions were, in large part, much more humane. The camps had things like sports teams, medical care, and even allowed student leave to some prisoners. Now obviously the Internment is still an atrocity, but the European camps were sites to some of the worst wholesale horrors in human history. The two are not the same.\n\n- The death toll. The Nazi camps were predominantly death camps, the Internment camps were not. There's a lot of nuance there, yes, but in the end the European camps were far deadlier in both scale and percentage. \n\nMore info: \n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/childofcamp/history/timeline.html\n\n\n\n\n&gt;The Germans on the other hand, were losing the war and instead of continuing to care for it's camps, it let them go to shit so they could use the resources to feed and clothes their young fighting men. Would the US have acted differently if we had lost to the Japanese. Would the Japanese found, upon our defeat, camps full of dead and starving Japanese? Did a lot of people die and suffer in prisoner camps in Germany in WWII, most definitely. Did the Germans do it maliciously or simply because they lacked the resources to maintain them? The Germans were sending their own children to the front lines to die before the end, not because they wanted to, they knew those boys would suffer relentlessly if they won or lost, so they let them go out fighting. Many of the ones that lived suffered greatly after the war. Was the holocaust merely a stretching of the truth to help many soldiers justify the people they killed during the war. A propaganda campaign to stem off PTSD as now soldiers could calm themselves by letting them know they did the right thing, they stopped the \"monsters\". In short, your question is black and white, why do some believe and some don't. \n\nThere's a lot to chew on here, and I'm not gonna pick it all apart. He's doing a \"just asking questions\" thing and I'm not sure where it's going.\n\nSuffice to say that the Nazis were very aware of what they were doing, and went to great lengths to cover their tracks. They simply didn't just \"run out of time and resources\" or some shit. They engaged in some serious collective efforts to [hide and destroy bodies, raze extermination facilities like Treblinka and Sobibor, and eradicate records.](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007273)\n\nTo suggest that they were magnanimously \"caring for the camps\" and were simply victims of circumstance is pretty fucking offensive, but then again this is a person who's floating the idea that the Holocaust is a \"stretching of the truth.\"\n\nHe seems to be rooting his examination in very half baked notions of history, which sadly isn't all that uncommon on this site, especially when it comes to WW2.\n\n\n&gt;Nothing is rarely black and white.\n\nI don't know what that means.\n\n&gt;The moon landing is easy to fix. An independent group simply needs to get together and build an unmanned rocket to go to the moon, orbit it, and take satellite photos of the surface. \n\nAlready did it*:\n\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/news/apollo-sites.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lunar_probes#2010.E2.80.93present\n\n(SEE EDIT)\n\n&gt;Unlike 40 years ago, the average person can buy a high powered telescope to watch this device leave the Earths atmosphere.\n\n[Ummmm....](https://www.google.com/search?q=high+powered+antique+telescopes+for+sale&amp;oq=high+powered+antique+telescopes+for+sale&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.9943j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=high+powered+1950%27s+antique+telescopes+for+sale)\n\n&gt;Average people can send beams to bounce off reflective lights on the moon, reflective lights on this moon orbiting satellite could also be detected by an average person. Radio waves, laser lights, and all sorts of other items could be attached to this satellite that would allow people back on earth to confirm it's existence and cross examine any video/photo evidence it beams back. Let's not argue whether it happened or not, let's use the last 40 years of advancements in technology to simply repeat what we did before cell phones or the Internet existed.\n\nAgain, already did it. And as far as that \"beam bouncing\" stuff is concerned... I mean... well I guess I kinda know what he's talking about? Green lasers maybe?\n\nI'm not even touching the bullet points at the top of the comment. A couple of users debated the \"WW1 Axis vs Allies\" thing but that's really just one of an alarming amount of questionable things going on here.\n\nI feel a little dickish dissecting this stuff because it isn't your typical Denier revisionist history prattle that we usually see on this site. This person seems somewhat altruistic in what he's trying to do here.\n\nStill, there's a lot wrong with it, and I have a feeling that I've only scratched the surface.\n\nInterested to hear your thoughts!\n\n**EDIT:** While it's true that NASA technically isn't an independent group, the veracity of their work is almost impossible to deny. But somehow I get the feeling that if SpaceX or some other independent outfit verified the Apollo sites it still wouldn't be good enough...\n",

        "text": "I believe this avoids being \"Political,\" even if the Monday Night Wars do postdate the Cold one. \n\nSo, this post is going to be about pro wrestling. You have been warned. \n\nThere's a certain narrative tied to the rise and fall of the World Championship Wrestling corporation, one most commonly found in the WWE Network series \"Monday Night Wars,\" or the depressing yet amusing book \"The Death of WCW,\" by Bryan Alvarez and R.D. Reynolds.\n\nThe essential shape of the story is true. The company that would become WCW was in trouble in the '80s, Jim Crockett Promotions, was bought out by Ted Turner. Turner didn't personally make every decision for the company like WWF (now WWE) owner Vince MacMahon did, entrusting it to the people who seemed to know wrestling to run for him. The company grew to success in the mid-late '90s, but was eventually beaten in the ratings, and the company collapsed shortly after the turn of the century. \n\nThe devil, as they say, is in the details, which the specific narrative tends to get wrong. I could pick plenty of nits on it, and maybe I will later, but for now I want to focus on one specific one, and that is the story of the International Object.\n\nNow, if you are casually interested in wrestling, and especially if you're an avid reader of Wrestlecrap (like myself,) you're aware of the story. It's usually used as an illustration of how out-of-touch the management of WCW was in the early '90s. The story goes that Bill Watts, who managed WCW for Turner in the early '90s, was an eccentric loon who made decisions almost at random. One of these was banning moves from the top rope, another was removing ring mats, and the most famous one was that, in an effort to avoid offending, Watts mandated that announcers must refer to Foreign Objects as \"International Objects.\" To quote the Wrestlecrap Book of Lists talking about the poorly named Final Solution... \n\n&gt; By 1995, WCW high-ranking officials were trying to put on a more family-friendly, politically-correct wrestling product. Gone were any scenes of blood, and televised chair shots were all but a thing of the past. Even the long standing phrase for weapons, 'Foreign Object,' was replaced with 'International Object.'\n\nNow, I'm not going to argue that no-one in WCW ever used the phrase International Object. Nor am I going to hold up Watts (or Ole Anderson, or whoever gets the blame in the version you hear) as some saint. Watts particularly has many traits I disagree with. Instead, I'd like to look at WHY the term \"International Object\" was used. The answer is quite simple, and honestly, quite amusing. It was a mistake. \n\nTed Turner, one might recall, owned more than just a wrestling company. He owned a group of TV networks, including \"CNN.\" Turner sent out a message to his cable news groups that rather than \"Foreign,\" the word \"International\" would have to be used. This was, of course, not referring to a \"Foreign Object,\" but instead things like \"Foreign Affairs,\" vs \"International Affairs.\" \"Foreign Leaders\" vs \"International Leaders.\" The idea being to avoid what we might call 'Othering,' by raising the specter of some outside group. \n\nThe memo, however, didn't just go to his news people. It went to everyone. WCW at the time was in dire straights as far as money was concerned, and quite frankly, no-one wanted to argue with the missive from above. When Turner did eventually get asked about the matter, he was apparently amused, and did explain that's not what he'd meant. But, at this point, the INternational Object was a part of WCW. \n\nThis is, I think, a good example of how something can be \"True,\" (WCW in the early-mid '90s replaced 'Foreign Objects with International Objects') but end up still being twisted. WCW officials weren't trying to replace Foreign Objects with International ones to make WCW more politically correct and safe. They were following confusingly written and misunderstood orders from the higher-ups, to try to avoid any chance that they'd cut off and end up broke.\n\nHonestly, I could do a whole run of things on what Monday Night Wars gets wrong.

How has everyone Forgotten about that? We were literally 5 min from nuking Cairo. (USS Liberty incident)\n\nSo much of this post is pure speculation that it's almost puzzling. \n\n* The CIA and Israel worked together to try and start WW3\n\nFirstly, why would CIA and Israel want to start WWIII? Especially during the Six-Days-War. I could possibly see Israel trying to get the US to retaliate against its Middle-Eastern aggressors, but why would they want to be involved specifically in *WWIII?*\n\n* [They pretended] it was Egypt and the Russians.\n\nIf this was Israel's (and purportedly the CIA's) intention, why would Israel inform the US of the mistaken identity and the mistaken attack 2 hours after it took place. Not to mention making no attempt to disguise themselves as Russian or Egyptian and using Israeli equipment.\n\n* [The USA was] literally 5 min from nuking Cairo.\n\nThere's no proof of this anywhere. Some F-4s were supposedly scrambled from an aircraft carrier to assist, but the information seems very vague, and F-4's ~~don't carry nuclear weapons.~~ (I will retract this since F-4s *can* carry nuclear weapons, though I don't think this is really an applicable situation for the US to be launching nuclear weapons on F-4s when better options would be available) Not to mention, the US most likely would not attempt to retaliate with nuclear weapons due to an attack on a ship from an unconfirmed source.\n\n----\n\nIt's hard to believe some people can be so convinced by these far-fetched conspiracy theories. There are other conspiracy theories over the USS Liberty Incident that are far more believable and almost plausible, why would anyone choose to believe Israel was working with hidden levels of the US government to start World War III. \n\nIt's puzzling why anyone wishing to start WWIII, would do it by attacking a US Technical Research Ship and expect a nuclear response. Not to mention *why* any nation at the time would *want* to start WWIII...\n",

        "text": "[ah dear](http://realhistoryww.com/world_history/ancient/Misc/Crests/Crests_2.htm)\n\nSo we've got a pretty short, sweet and stupid presentation today, so I won't spend too long on it.\n\n**Case the first: Aodh Dubh Ó Néill/Hugh Duff O'Neill**\n\nThe short biography of Hugh Dubh O'Neill given here is more or less correct. Though I suppose he technically would've been called MacArt, as Art was his father's name, I've never heard him referred to as such. It's very possible it might've been a nickname for him among his men or something. He was never called 'buidhe' as far as I know. I think the writer has conflated 'Dubh' and 'Buidhe', the latter being an epithet that could've possibly meant 'sallow' once upon a time but more likely and more often meant 'blonde'. 'Dubh' might look like it means swarthy to someone looking at a literal translation ('black') but Irish epithets generally have to do with hair colour so this is probably not the case.\n\nEven if that were true I'm not sure how it makes the portrait of Owen Roe O'Neill 'bogus', because he was a different man entirely. It rightly says that Owen Roe O'Neill was Hugh Dubh's uncle, but Owen Roe's epithet was 'ruadh', suggesting he had red hair, which seems unlikely for someone who supposedly looked African.\n\n&gt;What's right\n\nMost of the biographical detail\n\n&gt;What's wrong\n\n* Hugh Dubh O'Neill was never called 'buidhe'\n* 'Buidhe' does not mean 'swarthy' \n* 'Dubh' does not mean 'swarthy' \n* In any case, 'swarthy' does not mean 'African'\n\n**Case the second: Tomás Dubh de Buitléir/Thomas 'The Black' Butler**\n\nJohn Lodge and George Willis do seem to agree with the epithet 'Dubh' in Butler's case was earned because of having a swarthy complexion. They're both English historians so I'm not sure if that's just them misunderstanding Irish customs or if that's genuinely the case. [His portrait](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Steven_van_der_Meulen_Thomas_Butler_Earl_of_Ormonde_NGI.jpg) shows that he has black hair and a red beard, which is very typical among Irish men, so I'm banking on the former. He was called 'black husband' by Queen Elizabeth I, who was a close friend of his. She referred to Archbishop John Whitgift as the same, who also had black hair, so again I have a feeling that Butler was called 'Dubh' because of his black hair and it was misinterpreted by English historians. \n\nAll that in mind, it's entirely possible that he might have had a 'swarthy' complexion, a lot of native Irish people do (Colin Farrell, for instance). That doesn't make him black. It makes him swarthy.\n\n&gt;What's right\n\n* Biographical detail, yadda yadda\n\n&gt;What's wrong\n\n* 'Dubh' might not mean swarthy in this case\n* 'Swarthy' doesn't mean 'black'\n* The portrait they've called 'bogus' is of James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde, 13th Earl of Ormond, 7th Earl of Ossory, 2nd Baron Butler. The man they're talking about is Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormonde, 3rd Earl of Ossory, Viscount Thurles.\n\n**Sources**\n\n* Dr Rory Loughnane, 'Celtic Shakespeare'\n\n* Susan Doran, 'Elizabeth I and Her Circle'\n\n* J.G.

        "text": "Yesterday someone posted on Buzzfeed [this video of Ben Carson](http://www.buzzfeed.com/natemcdermott/ben-carson-egyptian-pyramids-built-for-grain-storage-not-by#.fsv2YZnE6m) from a speech he gave in 1998 at Andrews University where he talks about his personal theory about the true purpose of ancient pyramids. Both Carson and Andrews University are affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In an [interview with CBS](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ben-carsons-unusual-theory-about-pyramids/), Carson stated, \"It's still my belief, yes [...] the pyramids were made in a way that they had hermetically sealed compartments....You would need that if you were trying to preserve grain for a long period of time.\" \n\nThis is verbatim from his 1998 speech:\n\n&gt;My own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids in order to store grain. And all the archeologists think that they were made for the pharaohs’ graves. But, you know, it would have to be something awfully big if you stop and think about it. And I don’t think it’d just disappear over the course of time to store that much grain. And when you look at the way that the pyramids are made, with many chambers that are hermetically sealed, they would have to be that way for a reasons.\n\nAccording to CBS, the basis for Carson's belief is a reference from Genesis to the seven years of plenty, when \"Joseph stored up grain in great abundance like the sand of the sea, until he stopped measuring it, for it was beyond measure.\" In the Bible, Joseph fed Egypt and the rest of the world during the seven years of drought that followed.\n\n-\n\nSome people mistakenly thought Carson believed aliens built the pyramids, but he's not *crazy*! According to Carson, it's *scientists* who claim pyramids were built by aliens,\n\n&gt;And, you know, various of scientists have said, ‘Well, you know there were alien beings that came down and they have special knowledge and that’s how—’ you know, it doesn’t require an alien being when God is with you.\n\n-\n\nCarson ends by telling these college students not to worry about using logic or facts to explain their beliefs to others. All of their opinions are true based on the fact that they also believe in god as defined by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. \n\n&gt;People may not be able to explain what it is that you're accomplishing, but they don't have to be able to explain it when god is there. All you have to do is be able to accept his presence and his total understanding of everything and link yourself with that. And what a difference that makes. It makes you calm...\n\n-\n\nCarson asserts his theory about pyramids and then compares it to one alternate theory by straw scientists who claimed pyramids were built by aliens. Well, gee, if those are the only 2 options, it makes a whole lot more sense to believe Joseph built the pyramids with the help of god to sell grain rather than than aliens building pyramids to build tombs for pharaohs who didn't believe in the Bible. Scientists are so stupid.\n\n-\n\nWell Carson, I'm not an archeologist either and *my* personal theory is that the pyramids were built by extinct human-like giants (see [James and the Beanstalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_and_the_Beanstalk)) for Egyptian queens and princesses (\"King\" Tut was [clearly a girl](http://i.imgur.com/l77fRqn.jpg)). It's fun to make up history!\n\n-\n\n---\n\n-\n\nTheories accepted by mainstream archeologists and historians\n-\nI've been trying to find the most up-to-date theories by actual scientists and this is what I came up with, but I'll edit this if anyone wants to point out something more recent. \n\n-\n\n[According to the Wikipedia page on Egyptian pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_pyramids#Pyramid_symbolism)\n\n&gt;It is generally agreed that pyramids were burial monuments\n\n-\n\n[A 2011 article from the BBC on theories of pyramid construction](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/pyramid_builders_01.shtml).\n\n&gt;All archaeologists have their own methods of calculating the number of workers employed at Giza, but most agree that the Great Pyramid was built by approximately 4,000 primary labourers (quarry workers, hauliers and masons). They would have been supported by 16-20,000 secondary workers (ramp builders, tool-makers, mortar mixers and those providing back-up services such as supplying food, clothing and fuel). This gives a total of 20-25,000, labouring for 20 years or more.\n\n-\n\n^(Edit: Deleted a loaded term)\n\n-\n\n---\n\n-\nUPDATE\n-\n\nBuzzFeed posted an update to the original article after talking to John C. Darnell, a Professor of Egyptology at Yale. According to Darnell, \"The primary content of the pyramids are stones, they would be elaborate massive structures with little internal space to be used as storage of anything.\" Darnell went on to say that the story of Joseph is set in the time of Egypt’s Middle Kingdom, five centuries after the pyramids of Giza were built.\n\n-\n\nHe concluded by saying, “Pyramids. Not Granaries. We know this with 100% certainty.”",

        "author": "Dirish",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3rionh/following_up_on_that_most_important_of_bad/",
        "text": "As you might remember, Quouar posted [a most glorious post on bad history in one of the Buffy tVS episodes set in 19th Century Dublin](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3awuk5/to_everyones_surprise_buffy_the_vampire_slayer_is/). As a Dub myself [I took some issue with her sources](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3awuk5/to_everyones_surprise_buffy_the_vampire_slayer_is/csgzxc2), mainly because they only covered the south of Ireland. And since that's a bit of a different area when it come to the weather in comparison to the rest of the country, and especially the micro-climate of the capital, I didn't feel that the arguments that Whedon was wrong were entirely compelling. But back then the issue could not be settled by either of us because of the lack of availability of sources (the internet failed us miserably). Either they were behind a paywall, or just not available at all. I swore however to discover the truth at some point. Now four months later, I finally was able to visit the [National Library of Ireland](http://www.nli.ie/)'s archives when they're open (I did try emailing them before but they basically told me to do my own research, which I suspected they would say :) ).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe first thing I noticed is that there is only one newspaper source available for the winter of 1838 - [the \"Freeman's Journal\"](http://www.nli.ie/en/NewspapersDetails.aspx?IndexNo=1264), which also happens to be one of the longer running newspapers of the 19th century. The graveyard of Irish newspapers is filled with very short-lived publications, especially for the first half of the century (something something, Irish church causing the dark ages of journalism). For example the venerable Irish Times had a short-lived false start in 1823, only to close down in 1825. But it started up again in 1859 and is still published today. Most of the other long-living publications only started around the end of the century, which time saw a general increase in newspapers available to the public as well. The librarian on call speculated that the rising interest in the Irish National Cause amongst a larger part of the population caused a surge of interest in up-to-date information on what was going on locally. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the course of talking to the librarian, I mentioned in a roundabout way what I was trying to look for. I wasn't going to admit in public that this was about Buffy tVS, so I made up some stuff about a historical novel about that storm in 1839. Librarians can be extremely sarcastic and condescending, and I wasn't going to find out how bad this one was, certainly not after already building a friendly rapport when talking about the history of newspapers. Sue me :P. At which point I was hit with two pieces of bad news.  \n\n* First one is that there is no newspaper published on December 25th ( I kind of expected that). Holidays and all that stuff. But I figured that I'll just read the issue from the 24th and the bigger issue published on the 26th which usually is bigger to catch up on all the news missed from the day before. \n\n* the second was a bit more problematic: there was no weather report in newspapers from that time. Since we're at the dawn of modern meteorology in the 1830s, there wasn't really an established practise to publish weather predictions in newspapers. In fact, even though he was highly respected in the Royal Navy for his work, the press initially made fun of Francis Beaufort's efforts to build an accurate and scientific forecasting model. The Times (the UK one) was the first newspaper to publish daily weather forecast reports, and they only started this in 1861.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCurses...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[A minor setback](https://youtu.be/G6MEDUtcfBM?t=2456)... but I didn't drive all the way to town through rain and bad traffic to give up this easily (okay, okay, I didn't just go to town for this, also bought some books, a shirt, and a pair of trousers, met up with a friend for some coffee, etc. Details, details). There is still hope that one of the articles mentions the weather. To the microfilm department! Wait, what's that, my good librarian friend, they're self-service? Oh yeah, sure I know how to use one of those readers... (twenty frigging years ago, aaaah!). Great idea, let people who haven't loaded a film in a compact camera for at least a decade fiddle around with valuable archive material and expensive machinery. What could possibly go wrong? \n\nAs it turned out, surprisingly little. Finding the right roll was a piece of cake, I only bollocksed up putting it in correctly about three times, but that wasn't destructive enough to do any damage. Just make everything really, really fuzzy. Finally after looking like a grandfather trying to change the blinky-zeros on the DVD player, I managed to get it to work properly and started reading. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA few observations in general about that newspaper are that: Firstly it sure as hell packs in as much text as possible on a page. Large headers are rare, margins are small, every page is the same five or six columns of text going from top to bottom, ads are the only thing that stand out a bit, and thank the gods for a magnifier function on the computer software used. Secondly it's short; the average publication is three pages long. Which is odd since you have four sides of paper to work with. Thirdly there's a big chunk dedicated to foreign dispatches covering a number of countries in each edition (France, the German Empire/Prussia, India are nearly always mentioned), mostly from a British Imperial viewpoint of course. I found for example an announcement by Lord Auckland that he was launching a war on Afghanistan (the ill-fated First Afghan War) which was interesting since I recently read Dalrymple's \"Return of a King\" which covers this war in detail. Also letters from the public are as stupid and self-important sounding as they are nowadays.\n\nAfter reading through two dozen articles from both editions, I finally found something local that happened outdoors: two fires! One broke out on the 24th and the other happened on, dun-dun-dun, on Christmas day! And there it was, in the description of both fires the weather was casually mentioned in between the descriptions of what happened. The first article mentioned that the strong winds had fanned the flames of the fire on the 24th so much that the warehouse on fire was a total loss. The second one, that happened on Christmas day, mentioned a large crowd gathering to watch the fun despite the strong, biting cold winds and freezing weather. No mention of rain or snow.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**In conclusion:** Quouar was correct in assuming that the Dickensian White Christmas weather in the Buffy tVS episode \"Amends\" (S03E10) was wrong. In fact it was even more incorrect than originally stated: not only was it not a white Christmas in Dublin in 1838, it also hadn't rained in at least two days. But more importantly it was very windy, something that's clearly not shown in the offending episode [where smoke gently rises to the sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLnfap2VC0A).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI trust you will find this reply satisfactory, and remain yours faithfully,\n\nLieutenant Archibald Dirish, B.B.&amp; C.I. Rly, C.B., C.S.I., N.S.A.\n\n[Edit] Thanks for the gold, stranger. I feel honoured. ",

Just to give a few examples of cultures that have peacefully coexisted:\n\n-The Swiss and their neighbors right through WWII\n\n-Swedish-speakers and Finnish-speakers in Finland \n\n-Amish and Anglo-Americans in Pennsylvania since the 19th century\n\nAnd every great empire has adopted foreign influences.\n\n-The Romans adopted the architecture of Greece and the cults of Isis and Mithras from the Middle East, in time making them parts of recognizably \"Roman\" culture\n\n-The Arab caliphates adopted elements of European classical architecture (arches and domes in particular), a modified form of the Syriac script, and aspects of Jewish and Christian theology into Islam\n\n-The Chinese empires thrived off of trade with the Mideast, South and Southeast Asia, and in time even Europe. Buddhism itself is originally a North Indian religion.\n\nBasically the only example of a \"great civilization\" that has come close to validating Varg Vikernes' theory of history is Japan during the *sakoku* period, and even then limited trade and cultural diffusion from the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangaku), Korea, and China was allowed.\n\n&gt;The whole world is flooded in American consumer products....Fortunately we have a culture that is our own, and that is our Pagan culture.\n\nPagan culture? Umm, the 776 +/- years between the introduction of Christianity (around 1000 AD) and the founding of the USA apparently don't real, even though they account for three times as much of Norway's history as the Viking Golden Age (~750-1000). Norwegians went straight from drinking mead and praising Odin to wearing Levi's and praising America, apparently. The stave churches, the Hansa, St. Olaf, the Kalmar Union, and the abolition of Catholicism in [1537](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation_in_Denmark%E2%80%93Norway_and_Holstein) apparently are not a part of Norwegian culture.

I refer him and Langdon to [Yulong's post](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2nlf2e/badarthistory_most_renaissance_artists_were_like/), which details better than I ever could, why Leonard was not like supergay.\n\n&gt; Page 130 \"[Still \"educating\" inmates, after saying that Mona Lisa doesn't look male of female, but androgynous, Langdon tells them about the Egyptians:] [The goddess of fertility of the Egyptians] was Isis.

[He writes it on a blackboard, and the inmates get it: AMON L'ISA is an anagram of MONA LISA, so the Mona Lisa must be a celebration of the union of male and female.]\"\n\nI certainly hope that Brown gets beaten by a Zombie Francesco del Giocondo, whose wife was painted as Mona Lisa, for calling his wife kind of a guy. \n\nIsis was not a fertility goddess. At least not in the \"union of male and female\" kind of way. She was a goddess for mothers, birth, rebirth and magic. Practically only things after the \"union\".\n\nBrace yourselves, mon frères, now comes one of the bad-history-sproutingest pages I know:\n\n&gt; Page 134 \"[They find the secret message, and Langdon interpretates it as a hint that the secret society of the dead Curator had some real issues with the Catholic Church:] \"Sophie,\" Langdon said, \"the Priory's tradition of perpetuating goddess-worship is based on a belief that powerful men in the early Christian Church 'conned' the world by propagating lies that devalued the feminine and tipped the scales in favour of the masculine.\"\nSophie remained silent, staring at the words.\n\"The Priory believes that Constantine and his male successors successfully converted the world from matriarchal paganism to patriarchal Christianity by waging a campaign of propaganda that demonized the sacred feminine, obliterating the goddess from modern religion forever.\"\n\nOk, when we look at part one of my posts, we realize that the Prieuré de Sion never existed. The version imaginated by Plantard was anti-Semitic, reactionary and monarchistic, they wouldn't have supported any goddess worship. \n\nThere are a lot of things one could call the pagan believes of the Romans before and during Constantine. Matriarchal is not one of them, even if one could somehow take all of the very different pagan believes and press them into one Pantheon, it would imply that women had significant influence in religious or/and political things, which they hadn't. Not in Rome, not in Magna Germania, nor anywhere else in the antique world.\n\n&gt; Page 134 \"[Still Langdon on Catholics destroying the Matriarchy]: The Catholic Inquisition published the book that arguably could be called the most blood-soaked publication in human history. Malleus Maleficarum - or The Witches' Hammer - indoctrinated the world to \"the dangers of freethinking women\" and instructed the clergy how to locate, torture and destroy them.\n\nThe Malleus Maleficarum was published by a single Dominican monk, a Heinrich Kramer (he may or not have help from two other persons). He wrote it after he was thrown out of Innsbruck by the local bishop. The bishop also had let all the \"witches\" freed, that Kramer caught. The book was condemned by a panel of the theologic faculty of Cologne, later the Spanish Inquisition cautioned their members to believe things they read in it. \n\nAlso. Really? Mein Kampf wants its Genocide Olympic Medal back.\n\nAskhistorians has a [good post](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2jlvnn/ama_medieval_witchcraft_heresy_and_inquisition/clczxk5) about the freethinking women part. Spoiler: It's nonsense.\n\n&gt; Page 134 \"During the three hundred years of the witch hunts, the Church burned an astounding five million women.\"\n\nMost historians place the number firmly under 100 000. \n\n&gt; Page 150 \"[Sophie remembers happier days with her Grandfather, the Curator. He has a vacation home] in Normandy, north of Paris. [Later, she drives through \"Creully, north of Paris\"]\"\n\nThis pisses me off more than it should, I guess, and it's not even badhistory. Creully is indeed north of Paris. About 40 Kms. And it's 150 km west of Paris.\nNormandy is west of Paris. That's just /r/badgeography\n\nAnd here begins the other atrocious page we have to admit ourselfs today. Maybe our bodies are cleaned through the mortification of the mind.\n\n&gt; Page 171 \"[Langdon finally has the opportunity to get all the pieces together: He tells that the Curator was a member of the Prieuré de Sion and that it:] was founded in Jerusalem in 1099 by a French king named Godefroi de Bouillon, immediately after he conquered the city.\"\n\nWe still remember that the Prieuré is a hoax. Godefroi de Bouillion was the Duke of Lower Lorraine before 1099. After July 1099 - when the crusaders conquered Jerusalem, he was the \"advocatus sancti selpulchri\", the Defender of the Holy Grave, as he refused to be crowned in a city where Christ had worn the Crown of Thorns. He wasn't a King.\nAlso, this makes it sound like Godefroy was the main force driving and leading the first crusade. He wasn't. The crusade was more or less lead by a committee of nobles, including Raimond of Toulouse, Bohemund of Tarent, Robert of Flandres and Robert of Normandy (called Curthose), which have some right to be called as important or more important than Godefroy.\n\n&gt; Page 171 \"[Still Langdon about Prieuré de Sion]: \"King Godefroi was allegedly the possessor of a powerful secret - a secret that had been in his family since the time of Christ.\"\n\nThe secret, of course, SPOILER, has to do with the Holy Grail. Godefroy of Boullion's (greater) family was linked with the holy grail since at least Chrétien de Troyes \"Perceval\", but explicit mentioning the name of Godefroy together with the grail is Wolfram von Eschenbach in his \"Parzival\". To take medieval poetry as a source is brave, at least.\n\n&gt; Page 171 \"[Still Langdon: Godefroy needs to preserve his secret, so he founds the Prieuré de Sion. He heard of documents which are stored beneath the Temple of Herod and the Temple of Solomon which could attest to his secret, so] [i]n order to retrieve the documents from the ruins, the Priory created a military arm - a group of nine knights called the Order of the Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon.\" Langdon paused. \"More commonly known as the Knights Templar.\" \n\n*ominous music* The Templars were founded around 1119 or 1120 by Hugues de Payens, about 19 years after Godefroy's dead, that's a remarkably long game Godefroy's playing here.\n\n&gt; Page 171 \"[Still during Langdon's secret history of the Templars, Sophie objectes]: Sophie already looked troubled. \"You're saying the Knights Templar were founded by the Priory of Sion to retrieve a collection of secret documents? I thought the Templars were created to protect the Holy Land.\"\n\nThe Templars were totally founded to protect the Holy Land. Payens and his companions vowed to protect Pilgrims on their pilgrimage. Later, with greater prominence, the Order was de facto one of the most important parts of the defenses of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, with Templars fighting in every major battle fought by the Kingdom.\n\n&gt; Page 172 \"[Langdon's Templars even find the thing they were looking for:] \"They certainly did,\" Langdon said, explaining how it had taken nine years, but the Knights had finally found what they had been searching for. They took the treasure from the temple and traveled to Europe, where their influence seemed to solidify overnight.\n\n&gt; Nobody was certain whether the Knights blackmailed the Vatican or whether the Church simply tried to buy the Knights' silence, but Pope Innocent II immediately issued an unprecedented papal bull that afforded the Knights limitless power and declared them \"a law unto themselves\" - an autonomous army independent of all interference from kings and prelates, both religious and political.\n\nThe chronology is a bit off here, nine years of digging after being founded would be 1129. In 1129, the Council of Troyes, influenced by Bernard of Clairvaux, the founder of the Cistercian Order, who was a fan of the Templars and outlined their rules, endorsed the Templars as a proper Christian order. The papal bull which is refered to, *Omne Datum Optimum* was granted in 1139. The privileges covered in this bull were in no way unprecedented, as the Hospitaliers got nearly the same deal in 1113.\n\n&gt; Page 173 \"[Langdon continues about the Templars, now talking about their downfall, in 1307, Pope Clement works together with Phillipe IV of France to destroy the Templars. The Pope sends a letter to all \"his soldiers [...] in Europe\":] Clement's letter claimed that God had visited him in a vision and warned him that the Knights Templar were heretics guilty of devil worship, homosexuality, defiling the cross, sodomy and other blasphemous behaviour. Pope Clement had been asked by God to cleanse the earth by rounding up all the Knights and torturing them until the confessed their crimes against God. Clement's Machiavellian operation came off with clockwork precision. On that day, countless Knights were captured, tortured mercilessly and finally burned at the stake as heretics. Echoes of the tragedy still resonated in modern culture; to this day, Friday the thirteenth was considered unlucky.\n\nBrown overstates the willingness of the Pope to help King Phillipe. The Pope protested against the actions taken against the Templars, as they were under jurisdiction of the Church, and not the King of France. Phillipe had to threat Clement, who was residing in Avignon, with an army. Clements pre-predecessor, Boniface VIII, had died quasi-imprisoned by Phillipe, so this was no idle threat. After this, Clement was more compliant. Still, after Clement dissolved the Templars in 1312 (!) and gave the Hospitaliers their assets, and after Phillipe had the Grand Master among other Templars burned on the stake, few Templars were executed outside of Phillipe's domain. The remaining soon joined other orders.\nAlso, as [smileyman](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2md719/wherein_dan_brown_just_makes_up_shit_because_he/) writes, there is no evidence of the Friday the 13th myth before the 19th century, so it is unlikely to have started in the 14th century.\n\n",
