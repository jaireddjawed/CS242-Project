As they are waiting in the office, the agent looks over his paperwork and says:\n\n“The reason for your audit is that you live such a lavish lifestyle, yet not much income to justify it. Can you tell me what you do for a living?”\n\nThe gambler says, “I’m a professional gambler.”\n\n“A gambler?” asks the agent.\n\n“Yes, I make money from bets. Let me demonstrate. I bet you $1,000 that I can bite my eye.”\n\n“You have a bet!” the agent has a smug smile on his face. But it vanishes when the gambler takes out his glass eye and bites it. The agent did not see that coming, but he did agree to $1,000 in front of the gambler’s attorney.\n\n“Fine, that wasn’t fair,” says the gambler. “I’ll give you a chance to win your money back by betting another $1,000 that I can bite my other eye.”\n\nThe agent looks through the guy’s paperwork and sees he’s not legally blind, so he takes the bet. To his horror, the gambler takes out his dentures and bites his other eye. Now he’s on the hook for $2,000. \n\n“You know what,” says the gambler, “Double or nothing; I’ll stand on the edge of your desk,  close my eyes, piss into the garbage can on the other side of the room without spilling a drop. What do you say?”\n\nPerplexed but desperate, the agent agrees. The gambler stands on the desk, unzips his pants, closes his eyes, then pisses all over the agent’s desk.\n\n“YES!!!” exclaims the agent, glad he won’t owe the gambler anything. \n\n“Ah, shit.” sighs the attorney.\n\n“What’s the matter?” asks the agent.\n\n“Well... He bet me $20,000 that he’d come into your office today, piss all over your desk, and you’d be happy about it.”",

She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door, which she closed behind him, and took him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced.  \nWhen he had enough, they went downstairs and she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice.  \nWhen he was truly satisfied, she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup’s bottom edge.  \n“All this was just too wonderful for words,” he said, “But what’s the dollar for?”  \n“Well,” she said, “Last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you. I asked him what to give you.  \nHe said, “Screw him. Give him a dollar.” The breakfast was my idea.”",

He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper’s cemetery in the back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost.  \nI finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.  \nI felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play.  \nThe workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.  \nAnd as I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.  \nAs I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.”  \nApparently, I’m still lost…",
