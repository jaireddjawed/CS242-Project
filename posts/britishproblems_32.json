Has this happened to anyone else? Are you absolutely shitting me British Gas what kind of company makes that kind of mistake and doesn't even offer to reduce my payment or offer any kind of customer service because of their mistake that has inconvenience me. I have always paid my DD and if any money is owed at end of year immediately pay that too. We have electric flooring and BG shite DD system doesn't understand our electric is massively lower in summer and that we hardly use gas ever even though ive rung multiple times!.  Their constantly reducing my DD without asking or notifying me and I have to constantly increase it again  a few years ago this got me in to a pickle as I ended up owing loads as I didn't know they reduced my DD by half. God help whoever answers the phone when I ring. The manager is gonna wish they hadn't been born. I will be demanding a full write off of the amount they failed to take and will be writing to my ombudsman too. Any helpful consumer laws that will help my case gratefully received",

        "text": "This situation has been going on all of my adult life but one recent example that has really irked me and my partner, and frankly tipped me over the edge.\n\nInvited my dad and his new wife over for Christmas Day - we paid for everything, slaved away in the kitchen for many, many hours and served them all day, including endless free-flowing wine. Despite them turning up late, we were happy to do so and had a nice evening.\n\nFast forward to the new year and we suffered a catastrophic house flood which is likely going to cost us thousands, even if the insurance covered the bulk of it. We’ve also got our first child on the way in three months time. \n\nMy father and his partner invited us out for a meal this week, which was another pleasant evening - they heard all about our stressful events and the big financial commitments coming up in the form of the baby. When the bill came, we presumed they’d want to return the favour of Christmas and surely, being my father, would want to help in any small way they could (they’re very distant and hands-off in general - which is also irksome - but this surely represents a nice token gesture). \n\nInstead they just ignored it, stared at the floor and waited for me to sort it out. Eventually I did go up to pay, but I did look visibly annoyed towards my father who eventually got up and offered to pay half. They’ve done this in the past too, and they’ve subsequently paid nothing at all. \n\nMy father and his partner are both retired - we do earn much more than they ever did but they’re not poor - they have final salary pensions and no mortgage (unlike us!) and are purely being tight. And it’s not really about money, it’s basic manners. I’m frankly both embarrassed myself and for them.\n\nThis all occurs in the backdrop of my partner’s parents being exceedingly generous in all situations - financially or otherwise - which only add’s to my partner’s animosity towards my dad. \n\nSorry for the long rant. What would you do? Tell me I’m being reasonable?! TIA!",
