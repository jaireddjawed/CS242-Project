        "text": "Previous session here: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2mvuia/savage_worlds_tour_of_darkness_session_3_down_the/\n***\nWe left off with Cormac and the party held at gunpoint by some strange soldiers. After taking a Thanksgiving break last week, we return to the action!\n\nAndrew D. as PV2. Nelson Vaughn, the medic/radioman  \nNate L. as PV1. Huey O’Reilly, the machine gunner  \nJoe U. as PV2. John Winchester, the marksman  \nAdam T. as PFC. Joseph Butters, the grenadier  \nAlex Q. as PV1. Alec King, rifleman/’apprentice’ medic  \n\nWe also have a complement of NPC Extras, one for each player:  \nSgt. Frank “The Tank” LeBlanc, squad leader  \nPV2. Jeremy “Pothead” Pruett, the assistant gunner  \nPV1. Edward Christopher, another rifleman  \nPV1. Hudson “Hud” Dodd, another rifleman  \nPV1. Isaiah “Geek” Ryder, another rifleman  \n\nThe party holds their weapons at the ready, facing the new threat. These soldiers are definitely American, but carry no insignias and brandish AK-47s, RPKs, and RPGs. The supposed leader of this strange five-man team offers to help with the wounded Winchester, and Butters drags him over. One of the strange soldiers takes off his gloves and applies his hands to the wounds. Before everyone’s eyes, the area glows and the wound seals. Everyone is a bit amazed, and Butters loses a little sanity thanks to his disbelief in the supernatural.\n\nThe leader states that the squad are merely pawns in Cormac’s game, and he doesn’t want to come to hostilities. He just wants the briefcase of paperwork Cormac has at his side, and they’ll leave. Cormac orders them to retrieve the briefcase, and not let the spooks take it. The squad is at a bit of an impasse, as the very same spooks had just saved Winchester, but the party follows through with Cormac’s orders. Huey opens fire with his M60, and it literally splinters the right leg of the one that healed Winchester. Ed hits another, and the rest of the group pours their fire into them. Thinking the party would side with them, the spooks are caught off guard and all incapacitated. The only one untouched throws down his arms and surrenders, and Vaughn knocks him out. Winchester unsheathes his knife and stabs the one-legged man lying near him, ironically the one that saved his life. King goes to attend to their wounds, saving two but losing another under his care. Cormac commands them to restrain the prisoners, as they’ll bring them in for questioning. Leaving them to get captured and tortured by the NVA would be too cruel a fate. They tie-up the captured but alive ones and bring them into the office. Vaughn tries to interrogate them, but they won’t budge. Winchester uses a bit of deduction and coerces a little bit of information out of them. They admit to being a special team that works not for the US military, but the government directly. Winchester guesses that they might be spies or something.\n\nThe group goes to Cormac and questions him about everything. Against his better judgement, he agrees to let the squad in as long as they were willing to suffer the consequences. Butters and Pothead left to patrol the area as Cormac filled them in. He explained that he was a member of a group called the Sons of Solomon. They are an ancient society that hunts down magic throughout the world and helped study it. They fought during WWII on the side of the Allies, countering the blood magic of the Axis. But at the end of that conflict, there was a schism. The Sons of Solomon determined that magic was too dangerous, and they needed to keep it from human hands. A splinter group, Janus, wanted to use the power of magic to help protect and enforce the will of the United States. This created a mini-Cold War hidden deep inside American bureaucracy. The Sons of Solomon were sent to Vietnam under the guise of Project Phoenix, to study a surge in supernatural occurrences, most likely due to the NVA capturing old Japanese research facilities. Janus arrived under the guise of CIA Black CATs (Covert Action Team) to capture the occult power. Both sides were at war with themselves, and the North Vietnamese.\n\nAfter explaining himself, Cormac extended the invitation to join Project Phoenix, because the squad now knew far too much. If they didn’t accept, they’d most likely be forced through a strict drug regimen to help weed out the ‘bad memories’ and then be re-assigned to unassuming positions throughout the US Army to spread them far away from each-other. The group weighed their options, and Huey had private thoughts about siding with Janus, as he was astounded by the magical healing act they pulled on Winchester. In the end the group decided to join, but they couldn’t be properly initiated just yet. The NVA were coming in force, part of the much larger Operation RICH. Cormac was using the operation as his cover, as US forces would soon be swarming the area and the camp would be destroyed, allowing he and the specialists to slip away under cover of the assault. But now it was too late, and the group bunkered down with what ammo they had left, finding a small amount from American units that passed through. It took only an hour before the gunfire and explosions to begin. Helicopters buzzed overhead as APCs and American troops swarmed the area.\n\nThe squad made first contact with four hulking NVA that came tearing out of the jungle. They were at least eight feet tall, rippling with muscles and carrying PK machine guns. A grenade from Butters lands smack into the chest of one, leaving it a smoking wreck of flesh and muscle. Ed has a LAW shouldered, and the rocket shoots forth, carving a hole through another as the twitching corpse stumbled and fell. King opened fire with his M16 and managed to shake one. The other still standing opened fire with its machine gun, firing to suppress. King got hit by a lucky round and went down, but upon further examination realized the wound wasn’t as bad as he thought. Huey avenged him by riddling the last one alive with bursts from his M60.\n\nThe group organized again as the next wave approached. Overhead jets were screaming past and dropping their payloads into the hundreds of NVA soldiers that were pouring through the thick jungle. Another group of five hulking figures appeared, flanked by two normal NVA. A spot-on grenade from Butters cleared out the normal NVA soldiers, and Winchester shot one of the heavies in the chest, though it only shakes it. The other heavies suppress along the line with their machine guns, and Ed gets hit by a burst, falling next to King and pleading for help. Huey returns fire with the M60, and incapacitates another two with heavy fire. Butters hits another grenade burst near them and shakes one of them as its bathed in shrapnel, but the heavies’ suppression claims another as Pothead gets hit by a stray burst. Angered at the mortal wounding of his friend, Huey stands up from behind his cover and kills the heavies with his M60. King rushes to help Ed, barely saving the man. Vaughn attends to Pothead, and keeps him hanging on. The smoke clears and the battle is won as Butters fires a ‘borrowed’ RPG and creates a smoking crater where the incapacitated bodies of the heavies were. After another hour or so of post-battle clean-up, a chopper comes for Cormac and the specialists, and the squad goes with him. Paperwork for their ‘reassignment’ will be finalized ASAP, and it’s off to the Philippines for special training. Before embarking on their month long supernatural boot camp, Butters, King, Winchester, Hudson, and Vaughn receive promotions. Nobody is awarded a medal this time, though they found out Vaughn was given a Bronze Star for his actions last month.\n\nIn the aftermath of Operation RICH, almost 200 US soldiers were killed or wounded, to an estimated 400 NVA killed or wounded.",

        "text": "I'd run some successful Vampire games [n the past](http://np.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2nffmg/vtm_a_comedy_of_errors/), so we got a group together to run some vampires through the past. Plus, Dark Ages so more chances for folks to be all vampiric and not get the mortals in the same amount of tizzy. \n\nApparently, the success (or maybe the occasional hilarious failure) of the last game got around. This time I had a base of ***nine*** steady players. Furthermore, this time we had a number of 'floating' players - players who might show up, might not show up, might only play for two or three sessions, and so on. The number of floating players varied each week from 0 to 5. It kind of really sucked as a GM because planning is moot at that point. On the other hand it was somewhat flattering that I'd have fourteen people schedule to show up all at once. \n\nAs an aside - for this game we had the run of a two story, big, fancy house. There was very little furniture in it. Short version of the story is that the house belonged to one of those floating player's parents who had purchased it, never lived in it, but kept the address for tax purposes while they actually lived and worked somewhere else. The floating player had the keys (to check up on the place periodically) and arranged for one of the regular players to have a copy of the key as well. Sometimes said player and the floater were living in the house but during that time they were sleeping in sleeping bags. Otherwise, big empty house, little furniture (kitchen set, dining room set, a single battered recliner) along with an attached garage and a pool outside. We had full run of the place for games that would last for hours into the long dark nights. \n\n***\n\nWhen I started up this game, I had a general premise - a small city on the Adriatic caught between competing forces - Rome to the West, Constantinople to the East - as it navigates the forces of the Crusades as well as the struggle between the various vampiric Clans.     \nAt that point, I was thinking a group of three to five people. While we were trying to figure out a time and a place to meet, there was this convergence of players and suddenly we had a huge empty house and I had a whole lot of players. \n\nThe first night we all met up, I started going over folks character submissions. Aside from checking the Flaws of the PCs (as you know from last time, I sometimes get doozies), I'd only really said that I wasn't particularly interested in Bloodlines - PCs could be part of a bloodline or later found one, but I wanted them to identify with a Clan first and foremost. *Lineage*, I stressed to them, would be important. If we had multiple PCs from a single Clan, that was fine. Great, even. \n\n***\n\nWhat I wound up with:\n\n* ***Livinia*** - a Tzimisce of Roman birth who had slumbered in Torpor under the city for some time. The human child of a famous Roman general, she'd been embraced as a young unwed woman and subsequently married off in different generations. Understood a lot about power and politics. One of the oldest in terms of Generation and years. \n\n* ***Alyce*** - A Tzimisce from the area (what's now Albania). She was interested in local politics and political power. One of 'the Twins.' Noble autocrat.\n\n* ***Obryn*** - A Tzimisce from the area (what's now Albania). Interested in physical might as well as mystical knowledge. Think mad scientist mixed with warlord. Second of 'the Twins'. Tyranical monster. \n\n* ***Verik*** - A Gangrel mercenary. Based loosely on being a sort of Viking who got loose in the Crusades (think Varangian Guard, but it fell far short of that). Originally had a horrid combination of flaws including 'Mute' and an irrational hatred of Christians that got axed almost immediately. Player switched those around, came back with a Feeding Restriction: Christians and some personal enemies instead. \n\n* ***Jeton*** - a local boy who didn't understand the Embrace. Though he was a Brujah, he basically had been abandoned by his Sire. He thought that he was actually dead (his parents had actually buried his corpse) and was a ghost. Didn't quite understand Kindred politics, but wanted to protect the city. Hated his parents who had cast him out while he was alive because of his male lover (which is also sort of why he got Embraced). \n\n* ***Mirlinda*** - a Toreador and something of a local noble. She had Blush of Health and maintained her own Masquerade. Was a patron of the arts and encouraged a lot of local trade. \n\n* ***Daniel*** - Brujah. Common footsoldier from the Crusade. Originally from England, Embraced during the Crusades, never made it home. \n\n* ***Jacob*** - a Jewish Ventrue who had a lot of Contacts and a sizable Herd, drew Resources from the local port. \n\n* ***Saban*** - Started off as a Caitiff on the first night, then missed the next several games. When he came back Dark Ages: Werewolf had just came out, so we retconned him into a local woodsman who was a werewolf. \n\n* ***Paul*** - a Greek Toreador sculptor/craftsman. Played by the guy whose parents owned the House, he was only there on occasion because of things like work and a girlfriend. \n\nSo, on the first night I had this huge group. A HUGE group. Especially for a small medieval city. So, I took the list of NPCs I had and pretty much threw it away. I kept like 3 Vampire NPCs, turned a bunch of the rest into mortals, and went back to the group.\n\n*New plan, folks. Look around you. You* ARE *the Kindred population of this city. There are three NPC Vampires - one slumbers beneath a local Orthodox church (not the local Catholic one), one is a local fisherman, and the last is a mystery - an ancient vampire of unknown lineage slumbering in a cave beneath the city.*       \n*Now... figure out how you're running this city and who's in charge. You've got 15 minutes while I drink a soda.*\n\nThe way things shook out, the three Tzimisce were the rulers of the city. They were of different lineages but their sires were related under the blood. Each of the other PCs took control of something else in the city from watching over commerce to controlling various nobles, and so on and so forth. \n\n***\n\nThus would begin the second epic storytelling Chronicle in my hometown. This game would meet weekly for almost a year. \n\n\n",

        "text": "*I will continue this in the comments as it is running longer than I expected.*\n\nWhen I was young, I thought Odin must have cursed me.  \n\nFor sure, my childhood was probably far better than those of the thralls or common men that labored under my father’s rule.  He was a king you see.  Well, many might have called him a petty king, but not to his face.  Or where word might get back to him.  Sven Skald was feared the world over.  He had sailed the rivers and waterways of Europe, the frigid waters of the Baltic and the warm waves of the Mediterranean.  My father had raided and pillaged famous cities the world over, sacking Rome, Constantinople, Paris, and Alexandria.\n\nWe grew up in wealth.  My brothers grew up with the finest tutors of the land; teaching them strategy and diplomacy.  Most of their education was received at the hands of my father himself.  My sisters became masters of manipulation and learned the secrets of the gods.  They were the children of the mightiest Viking lord the world had known – why shouldn’t they have?  \n\nI . . . did not grow up this way.  The gods saw fit to give me a club foot.  This defect made me less than worthy in the eyes of my father.  For part of my youth I thought he sought to kill me, but it must have been my imagination.  He did discard my mother from his coterie of concubines after my birth.  And why should my father not have found me so wanting?  He had nine sons and five daughters besides me, each more fit than I.  \n\nThe mayor of the capital took pity on me, and offered to tutor me, and my father accepted.  I learned the magic of numbers and administration.  I mastered this craft and learned at his hand until I turned sixteen and officially came of age.  Though I had learned much of management, and I was physically impaired, I was still a Norseman – adventure called.  \n\nI presented my case to my father and asked his leave to join the Varangian Guard in far off Constantinople.  He laughed.  The court laughed with him and I could feel my face and ears burn with embarrassment.  But he waved his hand toward me with mocking magnanimity, “Of course my son! Go forth and make me proud!”  A mocking blessing was still a blessing.  I took it and set sail to join my new brothers.  \n\nThe next several years passed in a blur.  Due to my administrative skills, I found myself Steward of the Guard, though I learned to cope with my bad foot and become more proficient at leading men into battle.  I earned some measure of fame for myself and few of my brothers in the Guard seemed to care at all that I was cursed with my deformity.  \n\nSeemingly all too soon, my term in the Guard was over.  I sailed home.  My brothers and sisters were no longer part of my father’s court.  They held their own, now.  My father’s progeny held lands all over the Mediterranean and through the Isles far to the west.  My sisters were all married, their husbands all lords as well, the children owing allegiance to the House of Skald.  I alone of my father’s children was landless. \n\nMy entrance to the court caused something of a stir.  I forgot that I still wore the lacquered brigandine of the Varangian Guard that had seemed so unfamiliar to me a few years ago, and my father’s guards did not recognize me.  They leveled their spears at me and my training took over.  I snatched their spears away, using my weight to lever them into one another.  Cries of surprise and anger sounded throughout my father’s hall but soon, I was recognized and the guards – mortified at being bested by a cripple – were quick to bow before the son of the king.  \n\nMy father looked me up and down upon my arrival.  I returned his study.  He had changed in the years I had been gone.  His hair had begun to go gray, his beard longer.  The concubines around his throne were the same – in that I recognized none of them and most were younger than me.  “So,” he said at last, loading the single syllable with surprise, contempt, anger, disappointment and . . . something I couldn’t identify. “Your time in the guard did not kill you it seems.” He turned and spat. “How is it that you lived when your brother Sven, infinitely more worthy of you, died?”  I could not think of a proper response to that question so I merely stood, looking at him.  “Faugh.  What is it you want boy?”\n\nI took a deep breath, “My brothers and sisters have all been given lands to rule.  I ask for nothing more than what you have granted them.”\n\nThe old man stared at me in shock, his mouth gaping open.  At first I thought he may have had some kind of fit, but at last he gasped out a laugh.  “Lands! A title!”  Again, the court around him joined in his laughter, but this time my face did not burn from embarrassment.  I simple weathered the storm of their derision and looked my father in the eye.  Eventually his laughter died down and he smiled nastily.  “Very well.  I will think on it.”\n\nA few days passed.  I was beginning to gather allies and supplies to launch my own campaign for lands to rule as my own when I received a summons from my father.  Arrival in his great hall was greeted by a sneering smile, a look of malicious glee on his face.  “Ah! My most worthy son!”  Sarcasm dripped from his voice as he waived me forward.  “I have thought on your request and I have made a discovery!  The Queen of Loatharingia is unmarried and young! She has agreed to accept your hand in marriage.  You are to be a King my boy!” \n",

Saved some important people, made some phat dosh, have everyone not the bard actually get titles and land and shit. (I could have but said no because lolbard was determined to emerge from this campaign untitled).\n\n*Have intrigue happen: LadyBaron McWhoGivesAShit found evidence that we were actually trying to kill the king, and resurrect Kefka or something.\n\n*Evidence fake but based on real rumors.\n\n*Be forced into castle arrest while investigations happen and investigators arrive at party lands (in about three weeks, we lived in the fantasy-boonies). \n\n*Have royal guards posted outside doors every night. Spend favor to have mine be female cause lolbard.\n\n*Assnuggets running around destroying real evidence about Stalin-worshipping.\n\n*Bro-cerer dispelling shit cause summoning demons and devils is a big nono, and summoning angels makes the church wag fingers at you.\n\n*Buttmunchkin tries to take out people in town who know too much. Asked to not leave cause house arrest.  Doesn’t want to cause problems because actually lawful. Asks Shitface to do it for her.\n\n*Shitface actually has a stealth roll worth a damn. Easily escapes guards and castle and SILENCES THE PRETENDERS with ease.\n\t&gt;Forgets to hide evidence.\n\n*Be me, try to seduce guards (and fail hard) cause I legit have no idea whats going on. I legit believe that none of the rumors are true and that there will be no problems.\n\n*Next day: Murders come to light. Oops.\n\n*Shit goes down. Messages go out. Investigators are teleported in NAO!\n\n*Investigators discover half-destroyed Nazi-priest paraphernalia and methods that THE PRETENDERS were killed in the same way.\n\n*Have party totally confined to rooms. Be totally ok with this since it makes lady-guards a captive audience.\n\n*Shitface gets brilliant idea to blame everything on me to get revenge for earlier mentioned thing and since I’d be the easiest target. Plan is to move hidden-but-undestroyed evidence into my room and ‘remove’ me since lolbard and that I don’t have a clue whats going on.\n\n*Shitface easily escapes room guard and room. Make it to mine. No guards posted. Sneaks into room. Crit fails perception check. Crit fails stealth check. Doesn’t realize either (DM secret rolls for these. Just adds players bonuses then tells them ‘you don’t think theres anything there’ or ‘you think your pretty stealthy’ AD&amp;D style). Plants evidence and leaves. Thinks ‘perfect crime’.\n\n*Be me. Finally crit succeed seduction roll (Had to roll a 20 sometime with how often I got a chance to roll.). Sexytimes with both LadyGuards. \n\n*Happytimes had until suddenly door is thrown open and party member walks in with an armload of evil religious shit and papers. Walks over to desk and opens a drawer and shoves everything in it before turning around a leaving not bothering to close the door. \n\n*One LadyGuard rushes over to desk to investigate, the other grabs discarded sword and chases after Shitface nude. I admire the view for a few rounds until I remember Shitface will murderize her if he thinks he can get away with it. \n\n*Shitface turns and sees nude LadyGuard chasing after him. Then nude me chasing after her. Rolls to shoot her. No Bow. Figured it would be a quick  in and out (heh.) Draws dagger. \n\n*Guards level 4 fighters tops. Shitface is a level 12 assassin. He hits but does minimum damage (2 HP). LadyGuard rolls. Miss. This happens three times before I get there. I see a dude in a cloak I don’t recognize trying to kill my ladyguardfriendconquest and do what bards do best. I starting inspiring. \n\n*Be focused on this shit. Enemies at minuses to hit, friends at like +3 or 4 to hit and damage or some shit.\n\n*LadyGuard hits next attack and max damage. Shitface misses. LadyGuard crits and confirms. Shitface tries to run forgets AoO. LadyGuard hits and crits again. Other Guards starting to arrive, cause it’s a fight with yelling and singing at O Dark Thirty in the morning.\n\n*Shitface tries to escape out window but needs a tumble to get there. Fails by a few points and gets AoO’d cause all guards are buffed by me and goes down. I heal LadyGuard. LadyGuard grabs me and drags me back to room for more sexy times cause adrenaline or some shit. I let her cause hell, she just took down an assassin who was trying to frame me and my friends.\n\n*Next day. Investigation called off cause perpetrator found and caught but escaped shortly after. We notice Shitface isn’t at Breakfast. No one knows where he is. Investigators get suspicious. I cover for him, lying though my ass about a rugged bartender he likes “in that way” in the city and how they love each other and all that jazz. Roll wicked high bluff check. Investigators happy cause they have some dirt to bring back, the description of a assassin that’d been plaguing the country and that the respected nobility of WayTheFuckOutOfTheWay-Shire weren’t puppy-killing Kefka worshipers.\n\n*Shitface shows up a few weeks later once everything has died down wondering why the shit he’s getting so many letters from male suitors and why my grin is so smug.\n\nEpilogue For Those Who Care:\n*Shitface actually toned it down and became a reasonable character after realizing I totally covered for him. Eventually killed the king by total ass-backward accident. Someone else ended up stealing his assassin identity since he had to rapidly disassociate it from himself. Which ended up as a  funny plot of its own.\n\n*Bro-Cerer ended up summoning himself to the Astral Sea and came back a pirate. \n\n*Assnuggets actually ended up summoning up whatever the fuck it was he was trying to summon only to realize that it wasn’t NEARLY as powerful as the gods of law/commerce/empire running around and converted into a priest of travel and shit. Got in trouble with said god for exploiting demons for profit.\n\n*Buttmunchkin though fumbled rolls and accidents ended up totally in love with my character of which I had no idea about. Ended up challenging BattleLadyGuard to a duel since she believed we were a thing. We weren’t, it was a one night thing… until suddenly a noble lady wanted me too, then she was on me like white on rice. Duel happened, shenanigans followed then…\n\n*LadyGuard got turned into a fully fleshed out rival for Buttmunchkin who was just as min-maxed as her and thus one of the only challenges she could find.\n\n*I ended up a noble anyway since Buttmunchkin is scary and way the fuck stronger than I was and wanted marriage. Ended up married twice cause shenanigans between LadyGuard and Buttmunchkin actually turned into a plot point.\n\nEDIT: Greentext style doesn't carry over so well to reddit. Also Spelling.",

        "text": "I didn't think my life could get any worse, Today was my first day serving in the Deathwatch. The Deathwatch is a special unit in the Ordo Xenos that combines the greatest warriors from various space marine chapter and make them work together to hunt down xenos's, do suicide missions and serve the holy emperor. Today was easily the worst day of my entire life, and this beats the time when I was testing out a new plasma gun prototype and it blew up in my face melting half of head. If it wasn't for my techmarine buddy Namaan who replaced my destroyed head  with machine bits I would be dead. He even replaced my brain with a computer! The half of my brain that was destroyed had all my memories in it so he had to program in everything he knew about me including my personality. He wanted me to keep a journal so in case the computer breaks and he has to do the whole thing over again he has a first hand account of events I have experienced,  \n\nAnyway so I spend most of my time developing technology deep within my chapters monastery. I guess my skills where good enough for me to qualify to join the deathwatch, I couldn't refuse either because that would\"dishonor the chapter\". I dont like killing things, I like to sit in the dark alone fixing and creating stuff! I barley interact with anyone but Namaan and hundreds of servitors. I get lonley sometimes and give the servitors personality's, which always got me in trouble from the Master of the Forage. \"No A.I's, there too dangerous\" Pfft bombs are dangerous not lines of 0's and 1's formed to say \"good morning sir, how may I serve you?\"  \n\nSo there I was in a thunder hawk filled my \"noble battle brothers\". First of all there was these two chaps from the \"celestial Nightmare\" chapter. These two come from some death world with no oxygen or vegetation on it. So obviously the imperium established a colony there, so the entire populace lives in sealed domes and the planet is dependent on trade with other systems.One of them \"Lorenzo\" was a psyker, fuck psykers. I've never seen one before today but i'm always reading reports how \"psyker summons warp storm, millions dead\". There bad news and I don't like him. Then theirs his buddy: a sniper, I forget his name..... I'll refer to him as \"bob\". Then there was our squad leader \"Dan\". This guy was from the \"storm giants\" chapter, meaning he was MASSIVE.He was also the squads heavy weapon's guy.\n\nWere sitting in silence, This was the first time we met each other, expect for the two\"celestial nightmare\" chaps. These two were always together apparently, since space marine basic training 101. \"Lorenzo\" cleared his throat and said \"well I for am one am glad to meet my fellow battle brothers, I'm Lorenzo and this is \"Bob\". I am happy to meet all of you and cant wait to serve with you\" he looked at me and said \"ahhhh a techmarine, who might who be?\" I gave him the middle finger. \"wow your polite\" he said. Fuck people, I don't need them, I have robots to keep me company. He turned over to Dan and said \"so your the fire team leader and our heavy weapons guy, pleasure to meet you\". Dan slowly turned his head over and said \"pleasure to meet you too Lorenzo and Bob\". I fucking hate people I wish I  could replace all of them with servitors and go back to my repair bay and fix machines.                      ",

        "text": "Recently I've been playing some games of \"Ork Trader\". A game of Rogue Trader where we play as Orks. In our ramshackle ship held together purely by the Anzion Effect (The Ork power that if they believe something works it does) we quest to gather a mighty WAAAAAAAGH! to take to Holy Terra.\n\nCharacters:\n\n**Dok Zagbar:** An outlaw Mad Dok, hyped up on 'urty juice, with a deep and morbid fascination with \"modifikashuns\". Demands exorbitant prices for his surgery, and the results are rarely worth it.\n\n**Kaptin Gazbag:** Prefers to be called \"Da King O' Dakka\". Smaller than the other characters, but is the only one who knows how to fly the ship, and his guns are real flash.\n\n**Big Mek Zapstrak:**  Responsible for keeping the ship running, at least to Orky standards. Assists Zagbar with more technologically focused surgery. Drives their Trukk, \"Da Shooty Hurty Drivamajigger\". \n\n**Snagagrub da Grim:** The ship's \"Cheef Libruain\". An Ork with an unhealthy obsession with the Imperium of Man and incredibly powerful psychic powers. When on the ship, due to the large number of Orks, he cannot contain his energy. Any time he opens his mouth, he spits out a large gout of green flame.\n\n**Waagor:** The ship's Runtherd. A feral snakebite that doesn't really understand technology. Hates Zagbar because he constantly abducts his pets for experiments. Ship's record holder for eating competitions.\n\n**Maggrim:** The ship's mightiest Ork. Armed with two power klaws, two flamers, and kustom mega armour, he is himself a walking army. Also dumb as rocks.\n\n___\n\n**WEIRDBOY ENERGY**\n\nOur story begins on a regular warp travel day. Zagbar is ~~committing crimes against nature~~ conducting surgery. Da Kaptin is wandering around making himself feel important. Zapstrak is attempting to fit Eldar technology to his Trukk. Snagagrub is aimlessly wandering the halls. Waagor is attempting to crossbreed a hair squig with a facebiter squig (which he succeeds at). Maggrim is shooting the wall in the cargo hall, as always.\n\nSnagagrub finds the Kaptin, and attempts to greet him with a friendly \"Boss!\", and only succeeds in burning his favourite hair squig. In a rage, Gazbag whips out a kustom mega blasta and knocks Snagagrub out with a single shot. With the help of a couple of da krew, he drags Snagagrub to Zagbar's workshop, where Zagbar is attempting to replicate the legendary Grakgut's Cygrot.\n\n**Gazbag:** \"Fix dis git! He burned me hair!\"\n\n*Zagbar throws a vial of Mork only knows at Gazbag, then returns to his work.*\n\n**Zagbar:** \"You fix 'im! I'z got serjery ta do.\"\n\n*Gazbag strolls over to the operating table and shoots the \"patient\" with his Kustom Mega Blasta.*\n\n**Gazbag:** \"Git to work ya grot!\"\n\n*Grumbling, Zagbar hauls Snagagrub onto his operating table and (after ripping his teef out of course for payment), sews his mouth shut. For good measure, he also punches out the Kaptin's teef for \"da life insurance on da dead boy.\"*\n\n*Zagbar leaves an unconscious Snagagrub outside his room, as he resumes his quest to replicate Cygrot. Hours later, da krew is having an important meeting about which planet to attack next, when suddenly Snagagrub starts making strange noises and glowing.*\n\n**Maggrim:** \"Hurr hurr... weirdboy pretty...\"\n\n**Waagor:** \"Wot? Ah. Snagagrub! Stop muckin' about! We'z working!\"\n\n*Gazbag lightly taps Snagagrub's arm, causing it to explode in a bright flash of green energy (almost killing both of them), as bright green light rushes out of the new hole in Snagagrub's body. The krew (except for the two that are now unconscious) erupt into loud laughter.*\n\n**Zagbar:** \"Roight... better get dees gits to mah shop. MAGGRIM! HELP NOW!\"\n\n*Maggrim lifts the two unconscious Orks over his shoulder and carries them to Zagbar's surgery. Zagbar promptly knocks Maggrim out with a \"Zappa Kannon\" and steals his teef for payment. He reopens Snagagrub's mouth and replaces his arm with a shoddily assembled mechanical replacement. Zagbar fixes the Kaptin's wounds, and also replaces one of his feet with one from the patient he killed last time he was in the surgery.*\n\nThe moral of the story is DON'T MESS WITH SNAGAGRUB. The GM told us if we didn't touch him he would have exploded, possibly killing 3 of us. Good times.\n\n___\n\n**DA ORKIEST SHURIKEN**\n\nIn this story, Maggrim is taking a break from his busy schedule of shooting inanimate objects to sit in Zagbar's surgery and annoy him. Zagbar is busy working on a boy who requested to have all of his limbs replaced with Power Klaws, an idea that Zagbar thought was hilarious. Shortly after Zagbar finished his surgery, a loud order echoes throughout the hull over the loudspeaker.\n\n**Kaptin:** \"GET YA CHOPPAS YOU GITS! WE GOTS DA RED DEMONS IN DA HOLD! GET TO IT! WAAAAAAAGH!\"\n\n*Zagbar scoops up his weapons and gestures to Maggrim, who slowly drags himself to his feet.*\n\n**Zagbar:** \"Bring da patient!\"\n\n*The three of them arrive at roughly the same time as the rest of da krew, and finds their boys already fighting a horde of Bloodletter daemons. In the middle of the horde is a towering Bloodthirster, the most powerful daemons of Khorne. Da Kaptin lets out a battlecry.*\n\n**Kaptin:** \"LET'S GET 'IM BOYS! WAAAAAAGH!\"\n\n**Maggrim:** \"But I'z got da patient...\"\n\n*Da Kaptin turns to slap Maggrim for his idiocy.*\n\n**Kaptin:** \"STOP MUCKIN' ABOUT AND GET TO FIGHTING!\"\n\n*Miraculously, Maggrim gets his turn first, and throws the patient shuriken style at the daemon. The entire table cracks up laughing, and the GM doesn't even bother rolling. The patient's power klaws bore straight through the daemon, killing it instantly. But also the patient. Zagbar cheers, knowing in his heart that the experiment was a success, and spends the next week building more \"shurkurns.\"*\n\n___\n\n'Eadbiter Squigs\n\nRemember earlier when I said that Waagor was attempting to breed hair squigs and facebiter squigs? Well he succeeded. A cunning and brutal lot they were. They'd lie about in ship hallways, waiting for an unaware Ork to put the fluffy thing on it's head, then quickly bites the Ork's head, killing him. There's no real story here, but da krew had to spend about 3 weeks hunting all of them down. The GM tells us there's still one running around, but we don't really care, we think it's funny.\n\n\n",

The Sabbat Pack inside his head (well, part of a pack) had used its bonds of Vinculum to survive even past death (though surviving is a loose term here) and was occasionally stealing Josh's body in order to wreak havoc in town.      \nJosh knew nothing of this. The voices in his head were largely quiet while he was awake, but he was having periods when he was blacking out and losing time. He attributed this to his fast diminishing Humanity and increasing number of Derangements. \n\nMadelyn was trying to keep tabs on him; for a while she managed it. She even used his black-outs to track him to other Sabbat cells. She'd then call in Scott and Scott would have the cell wiped-out.      \nThat worked maybe twice. Then Josh led Madelyn (well, usually a Retainer of Madelyn's) to part of Josh's Herd and then later on an Elysium Salon. Time to switch tactics. \n\nThe Coterie, as a whole unit, got wind of some major Sabbat movement in a particular area of the Underground near one of their own communal Havens (*strangely, the PCs on their own had started using very Sabbat-like practices to protect themselves, including Communal Havens and a convoluted net of Blood Ties to one another*). So, they decided to throw everything they could at it in an attempt to dissuade the Sabbat from hanging out near their territory. \n\nIt was something of a blood bath. The Sabbat in question were actually two or three packs geared towards assault and infiltration. They had essentially taken a portion of the nearby Underground, shunted it from two tracks to one, and on the \"unused\" track set up shop an \"empty\" series of subway cars - they had everything from captive humans (used for food), chained war-ghouls (mortals shaped and twisted to know only combat), and of course gear, supplies, and maps.      \n\nThe PCs tried to help, they really did. Well, mostly. There was some salivating over the Sabbat's maps of known and suspected Kindred Havens in the city (some of the PCs like Wilhelm and Josh were very interested in these for their own plans, Scott was interested in a horrified sort of way - security was his shtick and this was a big friggin breach). Madelyn and Des and Will were trying to get the mortals out when suddenly someone noticed that one of the mortals was in a lot of pain.    \n\nWell, of course she was. She'd had a sizable amount of explosives sealed inside of her. They all panic. Try to get away. Big boom. And then the Sabbat come roaring in, the war ghouls get free, and there's mass chaos. \n\nMiraculously, everyone gets away - though they do get split up and pretty much everyone was injured to some degree. \n\nHowever, they soon realize the problem. There are Sabbat around who know the Havens of most of the Kindred in the city. They ***had*** a secure base they were planning things from, but now that's been exposed and blown wide open. The Sabbat's next step would likely be to attack because the Coterie hadn't really done a ton of damage to the Packs that they had been tracking and a lot of the war-ghouls had been led away. \n\nSo, Madelyn and Scott went to the Prince to try to explain things. In order to get the word out quickly, the Prince sent out a mass Summons (high level Presence, woo!) to get all of the Camarilla Kindred to assemble in one central location. They had to get the word out for everyone to leave their Havens and to organize a coordinated assault and defense. \n\nBig location. Set piece. Lots of Kindred plus their ghouled Retainers. Everyone is nervous, twitchy, on-edge. \n\nSome Perception rolls are made. \n\nDes realizes that aside from herself and Wilhelm, none of the Tremere are in attendance. None of them. She gets a little panicky, worried in part for the Clan that's housed and sponsored her, and part because without them, she's not sure how long she'll last in the city. There have already been a couple of instances of Sabbat Lasombra specifically targeting her in earlier games.    \nShe tells Scott and Wilhelm. Wilhelm is unconcerned, but Scott is nervous. The Tower of London is a big and well-known spot. If the Sabbat know that the Tremere are there, he reasons, they may try to destroy the whole place, striking a blow not only at the Tremere, but against the heart of mortal London as well. \n\nQuickly, Des and Scott try to get a group together to head over to the Tower and see what they can find out - none of the Tremere are answering phones or the Summons. Madelyn, Josh, and Wilhelm don't want to go. Will is willing, mainly because of his ties to Scott and Des. The Prince is initially against the plan, but finally relents. \n\nHowever, as Des, Scott, and Will are about to leave (there's an underground garage with elevators that come up to the floor where the assembly is gathered), they spot several vans pulling up to the elevator doors (via internal security cameras). Over the camera feed, they see the van doors open and a squad of war-ghouls pouring out - led by what appear to be the Tremere from the Tower! \n\nRemember this bit from Part Four?     \n&gt; She wasn't able to get too close to him, but she did learn that he was the oldest Vampire in London, older than the Prince and in fact older than the Battle of Hastings. This was a big thing that went totally unremarked.\n\nYeah. There were other clues, but basically the ancient Tremere chantry-head was actually not a Tremere, but was actually a Sabbat agent from the very early days of the first Anarch revolt (that would become the Sabbat). He'd been feeding information to the Sabbat through contacts for a while, and secretly shipping away (or killing off) honest/actual Tremere who came to the city - usually with an overwhelming amount of Dominate and Obfuscate ladled on top. He kept the city's Kindred at enough distance that none of them realized he wasn't actually a Tremere (he's old, he's creepy, he's occulty, and he does blood magic, what else could he be?).\n\nHe wasn't actually leading the assault, however. He was actually too much of a scheming coward for that. \n\nThe Sabbat rolled into the assembly hall with out much in the way of warning. As you can imagine, this didn't go well for anyone. \n\nBig things that happened:\n\n* Josh finally realizes what the voices in his head have been doing as Guy pops up again to not only gloat, but to attempt to lash Josh into joining the fray on the Sabbat side of things. Guy opens up a flood of 'memories' of the times Josh had blacked out. Filled with a catalog of new horrors, Josh's Humanity finally wins out. He finds Madelyn in the chaos and begs her to stake him until they can find someone to cure him of his demons. \n\n* Bill the Caitiff makes a reappearance in the Sabbat Horde as a Beast-ridden centerpiece to a huge war-ghoul. He'd had several partial ghouls flesh-crafted to his body, making him into this multi-armed, multi-legged, multi-mouthed *thing*. \n\n* Wilhelm sees the Tremere come storming in at the head of a bunch of war-ghouls. He doesn't do the sane thing, equating the war-ghouls to the ones of the Sabbat that he had just seen the game session before. No. Instead, he assumes that the Tremere are staging a coup during the midst of war time. *And so he starts flinging summoned flames and stakes and whatever else he can manage at the Camarilla around him.* He actually fights his way over to the traitorous 'Tremere' and tries to start commanding them, relying upon his Tremere Status to give him some sway. Things go... *badly*... for him. \n\n* A lot of blood, death, and destruction. \n\n***\n\nEssentially, this was the end of the Chronicle. \n\nSort of.\n\nWe did a big wrap-up to tie up a bunch of loose ends. \n\n* Madelyn wound up pressing a Blood Bond on Josh and over time they were able to restore some of his Humanity. He continually had to fight Guy in his mind, and became a sort of mad hermit wandering the moors of Britain. Madelyn stayed in the city as part of its new Primogen council, but would spend some time each month (during the dark of the moon) at a country estate where she would meet and work with Josh.\n\n* Scott remained the Sheriff of London, covered in scars. He developed an Auspex-Valeran combination that allowed him to track souls so that very few could evade his reach.\n\n* Des became part of the Primogen Council, speaking for the downtrodden and the outcast. She was still an occultist (sometimes helping Josh with his consumed souls), but she distrusted Blood magic. ",

        "text": "Players were:\n\nDave - DM/undead paladin of vecna/me\n\nJonathan - Sparkle Gemshaper the resident gnome illusionist\n\nKenneth - Garrosh Hellscream the half orc fighter/forceful wolf tamer.\n\nSascha - gor'bash the idiotic good gnoll who hated the current town.\n\nAndrew - a halfling bard who's name I've forgotten.\n\nThe party had just returned from hunting wolves unsuccessfully, Gor'bash was jealous of Garrosh's pet and wanted his own, and decided to investigate the haunted mansion in town that a group of mystery solving adventurers and their blink dog had disappeared in. The undead paladin (who no one knows is undead) was gone, he is a sort of npc/pc hybrid that shows up whenever, and the party had just met a successful halfling bard. Along with their new bardic helper, the group entered the mansion and immediately found a skeleton code named \"Fred\" sitting fully clothed in a chair in the servant's room. After consulting for a bit they decide to continue investigating and find a kitchen full of half eaten moldy food. After consistantly failing listen checks the party is jumped by a female halfling zombie code named \"Velma\". The zombie tore into one party member pretty bad so the players detoured to the temple for a quick heal before returning to the mansion and searching the kitchen. After the group found a dumb waiter and shoved the bard into it, my character showed up. Imagine if you will being a bard crawling out of a dumb waiter into a dusty room only to see a nazghul looking guy raise slowly off of a bed and say, \"hi friend, how's it going?\" After challenging me the bard sang a touching song called \"Alone in a Dark room with a Cloaked Stranger\" which got him 3gp and applause from my character. The rest of the party took the grand staircase up to the second floor, minus Garrosh who climbed up the dumb waiter shaft. After meeting up with the bard and myself, paladin of Vecna, everyone went into a bath chamber which had a skinned blink dog \"Scooby\" hanging from a rope over a bathtub full of blood and arcane runes scribed all over the walls. Sparkle the wondergnome immediately detected magic on the runes and got to work figuring out their purpose, while Gor'bash foolishly stuck his arm into the blood filled tub only to be grappled by something inside. At this point two things happened Sparkle figured out the runes were summoning an entity, and Gor'bash narrowly avoided being pulled into the tub. Sparkle decided to burn away some of the blood to see what was inside and revealed a humanoid shape which then began to rise out of the tub. Sparkle thinking quick began wiping runes from the wall and through a lucky percentile roll stopped the creature, \"shaggy\" from making it to combat readiness. After this Garrosh butchered \"Scooby\" to sell as steaks to the townsfolk and the rest of the party retired to the inn for the night. I've not run part 2 yet, and may not get to but I'd like to point out that Daphne wasn't found and the effects of meat from a sacrificed blink dog on the general population of the town hasn't been determined yet.\n\nEdit: sorry if it was hard to follow, I was racing forgetfulness to get it written and may have left some good bits out.",

        "text": "It had been 100 years since the Battle of Palermo, where Duke \"The Troll\", his real name unknown, engaged the soldiers of the moors numbering fourty thousand strong with his expeditionary force of two thousand, under the banner of the Lord, to regain the Duchy of Sicily from the infidels, and smashed their armies, killing half, until the Duke himself was gravely injured and the army retreated to save him.\n\nIt was the reign of King James^1, a direct male line descendant of the Duke. The dynasty had expanded greatly, reaching new heights after forming the Kingdom of Wales, conquering parts of Spain, Mauritania and Mali and claiming, through a crusade, the Kingdom of Hungary from the heretical magyars. Irish was spoken from the Atlantic to the Carpathians, and a long standing alliance with the King of the Irish and Scots facilitated security in the British Isles.\n\nHowever, the duke's dynasty had its darker side. Fueled by greed, they declared the Bishop of Leinster as the True Pope in order to levy more church taxes, sparking a hundred years of turmoil in Europe, as the two popes battled for control of the bishoprics across Europe. Outraged, major kingdoms, and even the Holy Roman Empire turned to heresy: lollardism, catharism and fraticellism was plaguing the Holy Church. One of these kingdoms was the Kingdom of Norway.\n\nAt the time the King of Wales was interested in expanding his influence in the Baltic Sea, having inherited two strategic counties in the de jure duchy of Lithuania. The Holy Roman Empire was too strong to be fought alone, and it controlled most of the southern coast of the Baltic that interested His Majesty. He turned instead his attention north, to the Kingdom of Norway which had absorbed the Kingdom of Svithiod^2.\n\nThe Kingdom was tired of wars - their endless wars with the moors had killed many peasants, and another war would've meant a revolt. Thus, the King came up with a not-so-cunning plan: he would marry his daughter matrilineally to the retarded son of the King of Norway, plot and murder the other sons until the heir would be his son-in-law and then murder the king, hope for a child and then the Kingdom of Norway would be safely secured in the hands of the dynasty.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the King of Norway was glad to finally find a wife for his son, who he couldn't get rid of and who meant a possible pretender revolt by roudy vassals who simply wanted an easy to control puppet on the throne. Once the marriage was done, the son moved near the royal capital of the King, in the town of Gwinneth^3.\n\nHe lived a few years of his life there while the King was plotting against his brothers. It took half a decade, but James achieved what he wanted: his son-in-law, who he didn't even know the name of, would be the heir to the throne of Norway.\n\nAfter a few failed assasination attempts towards the King of Norway, James decided to do the waiting game; after all, the norwegian king was eighty years old, and would soon reach the end of his life. Little did he know that in the midst of all the religious turmoil, a recently elected mayor decided that this would be the time to show his piousness and servitude to the pope (of your choosing). He arrested the norwegian heir and sentenced him to hanging. By the time the King realized what was happening, his decade plan to take Norway and Sweden was thwarted by a self-righteous pseudo-pious mayor.\n\nThe next day, the king gave two orders: the first was that the mayor would be arrested, brought to the capital, impaled and displayed in the main plaza for a month. The second was that an envoy was to be sent to the Kingdom of Norway to declare war, a war that would lead to the conquest of the duchies of Svithiod and Trondelag, key in the Kingdom of Norway, fulfilling James' goal. This achievement would not last the test of time, for revolts and a broken treasury would lead to Norway retaking these provinces, however not before they were reconverted to catholicism and the population replaced with irish.\n\n^1 I genuinely forgot his name actually, since this happened a long time ago and I'm not sure if I have the save file anymore, but let's roll with it\n\n^2 Sweden\n\n^3 I forgot this name too, but I could fire up CK2 to find out (not right now though, since this laptop can't handle CK2, but still)",

The Sabbat and the Camarilla were at each others throats. The Sabbat had pretty much claimed all of the Underground - it was frankly unsafe to travel the subway/trains around London if you were a vampire. Oh, it could be done, but you were never quite assured of actually reaching your destination. \n\nJosh the Malkavian was embracing his madness and delusions mainly because there were very few Malkavians in the city. Most of them were fairly powerful, but  not really political. As such, they were constantly leaving hidden messages everywhere about what was actually going on. Or so Josh told the others. \n\nJosh had recently committed Diablerie upon a Sabbat pack leader... and done so poorly. He managed to eke out the following from the horrid deed: a small amount of Sabbat lore and knowledge of tactics, a dot of Celerity, and a back-seat passenger in his brain.      \nYes. The guy he'd diablerized had rolled well and now was in Josh's head, whispering to him on occasion. Sometimes screaming at him. \n\nThe guy agreed to help Josh, however. Offered to help him kill off a whole lot of Sabbat. Guy would supply names and as long as Josh kept his eyes open, locations sometimes as well. \n\nJosh was iffy on this. He didn't want to give control up to Guy. So, he just asked for information off and on. Eventually, Josh managed to track down a Sabbat on his own (well, partly on his own). He recognized him from the raid the Coterie did against the Sabbat when Josh had diablerized Guy. The target seemed weak, so Josh waited until there was no one around, hit the victim with Dementation and then pounced on him.      \nAnd nearly died as a result. Though wounded, the target had just fed. It spent a lot of blood healing up and then fought back ferociously. Josh started using Celerity (that he got from the Diablerie) so that he could attack and dodge. Eventually, Josh was wounded and low on blood and still engaged in a tough fight... and then, he blacked out.      \nWhen he came to, he was crouched over the torpid body of his foe. Uncertain as to how he had beaten his foe, but not wanting to pass up a chance, promptly dove in and Diablerized his downed foe. \n\nAgain, he didn't seem to get much from it except for a lift in Generation. Josh had the bug. He didn't want to stop. Every time the party got wind of a possible group of Sabbat, Josh was one of the first in, constantly citing his ability to hide and spot the Sabbat and his (new) knowledge of Sabbat tactics.      \nHowever, there were some failures. As it became clear to the others what was going on, Wilhelm the Tremere noted the tell-tale signs of Diablerie in Josh's aura. So, did Wilhelm turn him in? Nope. Wilhelm started competing with him, occasionally threatening to reveal Josh's secret if Josh didn't give him a staked or Torpored foe. \n\nJosh was a bit livid. However, he didn't have a lot of choice. Guy in his head seemed to be getting stronger as Josh's Humanity waned. Josh (and somewhat Josh's Player as well) started to panic. He started out chasing down lore and information. Josh's Player wanted to switch Josh to a Path of Enlightenment instead of Humanity. However, it didn't seem that there was anyone in the city who was *actually* on a Path.      \nExcept of course, the Sabbat. \n\nJosh wanted to track down and capture a Sabbat and try to get the information out of them. But he couldn't figure out how to actually find a Sabbat and talk to them at this point because it was pretty much open warfare whenever the Camarilla or Sabbat ran into one another. Guy, in Josh's head, said he could help. *Wanted* to help, actually. Josh didn't exactly trust him.        \n*Actually, this bit role-played out rather nicely. Josh's Player and I went into another room, and there was a broken mirror, so I had Josh looking into a mirror at his broken reflection and I sat behind his Player and narrated Guy's voice. Really set the mood.* \n\nHowever, he agreed to it because Guy was very persuasive. Josh agrees, blacks out. He comes to later on, sitting on the stoop of Madelyn's large estate, half-covered in blood and Vitae. He felt stronger. Guy in his head was quiet. Josh thought that he'd done it... even though he couldn't remember anything. \n\nBy the time of the next game, however, Josh was in for a surprise. He still wasn't on a Path, but he'd gained another step in Generation and some additional points in Disciplines. However, Josh's Humanity was now very low. Mortals got uneasy around him and he couldn't really interact with a Mortal without being hideously creepy and predatory (unless he was using Disciplines, of course).       \nEssentially, his Humanity score was a dice-cap to his social skills with mortals. Vampires were another problem. Even to a lot of them, he seemed *off*. More so than normal.      \n\nJosh wasn't worried though. Suddenly he was really keen to see what all these new dots in Disciplines that he had would do.      \n\nMeanwhile, inside Josh's head, Guy had managed to arrange it so that Josh actually Diablerize several members of Guy's former Pack. Calling upon those mystical bonds of Vinculum, Guy used their Willpower to bolster his own. He was now able (almost) to take over Josh's body whenever Josh was under any sort of stress. \n\nAnd things in the city were becoming more and more stressful. ",

        "text": "[Another story from that ~~horrific~~ wonderful time that I DM'ed a game!](http://redd.it/2nl60x) For those of you who weren't here last time, good! You won't be quite as confused when I suddenly flip perspectives again. My players consist of ~~Virkri~~ Rose the Dullahan, an empty suit of armor with a level head and a sense of justice, and Pratena, the mute cycloptic murderchild. When we last left this particular duo, they were in Pratena's hometown, an orc village by the name of Townorc. Momorc and Dadorc had sent Pratena (surname Orc) off to have a life of adventure. So far, she's having plenty without ever straying too far from home- and she even made a friend! Who killed a man with a rosebush!\n\nAnyway, Pratena and Rose had just gotten home from a grand old day of adventure, and since Rose didn't need to sleep, Dadorc hired her on as a night watch. During her lovely guard duty, she saw many interesting things, like the distant treeline, some grass, dirt, a constellation that sorta looked like a butt, and this weird flickery light in the distance that seemed to get closer and closer. Because it was. That flickering light was a living creature which approached Rose and started snarling things.\n\nThe flame-consumed creature growling half-riddles at Rose was not the most pleasant person to talk to, but hey, Rose was just a suit of armor, who was she to judge? And then the flamey person started asking pointed questions about Rose's past, which was fuzzy at best. Eventually, it demanded to see the palm of Rose's gauntlet, for that was where dullahans had their \"duty\" inscribed upon them. Rose was somewhat surprised to find that she did, indeed, have words carved into her palm... words in a language she did not understand. The flaming creature was curious about how a \"free\" dullahan could possibly act on its own will without first destroying the hand bearing its \"duty\", but moved on to another matter- this growling, snarling fire-thing wanted to hire Rose as a mercenary.\n\nRose wasn't sure about the issue until she heard the full story- this flaming thing was a Dryad, one of the all-female race of graceful, nature-attuned guardians of the forest. The reason she was on fire? She had been liberated from her \"connection\" to the plant that had infested and dominated her mind. And this Dryad could sense another Dryad nearby, silently suffering as a mind-slave of some tree. This shit would not stand, and Misus McFlamy needed a bodyguard (meatshield) while her sister Dryad was properly freed. Of course, in addition to doing the right thing, there was also the prospect of loot and coin.\n\nRose waited until morning and woke Pratena, telling her of the night's events (especially the butt-constellation). The little Cyclops was positively giddy at the prospect of heading out to murder things for fun, lunch and profit so they set off pretty much right then and there, with McFlamy leading the way. They eventually came upon some sort of ruin set underground, accessible through a grassy ramp leading to some imposing double doors. When Rose asked McFlamy why the hell her sister Dryad was in this ruin, McFlamy shrugged and said something about there being a new one of these damn things every other week. Whatever, time for adventure!\n\nOur group strode in with caution, looking around at the weirdly well-maintained scenery and keeping an eye out for anything dangerous. They found a corpse lying in a puddle of blood with a couple of rats feasting on it, and decided that they probably shouldn't go near that weirdly-colored floor with those big dried bloodstains on it. Instead they decided to check out a little alcove with a couple of bookcases, and perused the selection. Pratena took one called \"The Joy of Eating\", and Rose recognized a book in that same weird, flowing script that she had on her palm. While Pratena's book contained a bunch of weird magical glyphs and a whole lot of mumbo jumbo, Rose's book apparently contained a small blizzard. How about we don't open that until again someone with magical sense can look at it?\n\nMcFlamy was some help, but even she didn't recognize the writing. She mostly stayed in the background, letting the two melee fighters navigate things and trigger all the traps. And there were traps- closer inspection of the chewed body revealed that it had been nearly bisected by some sort of blade pendulum thing that apparently finds work in every decrepit ruin ever. More interesting, though, was the fact that the discolored floor with the bloodstains actually had two seperate pressure plates. In the name of science, Pratena picked up the corpse (hereafter referred to as Buster) and hucked him onto the discolored floor to see what happened. What happened was loot. Lots of loot.\n\nAn entire chest of coins was dumped into, well, Rose's chest- they just popped open her breastplate and upended all of the weird coins straight into her. She didn't mind the weight, but all the loose metal made her sound like the world's largest and most murderous piggy bank.\n\nAfter that, they popped open a (blistering hot!) metal door onto a room filled with steam. This trap was simple- there were three hungry red slimes lurking beneath a metal grate, and whenever people entered the room, the slimes shot jets of steam at them. Luckily, Rose gave aboslutely zero shits about any attack that wasn't a critical hit, and marched on through to pop the door on the other side. She wasn't seriously injured by the whole affair, but the heat and humidity was making her rust just a little. Pratena just marched through because 1d6 fire damage doesn't mean shit when you're a race that has Fast Heal 1 as a free trait. Why did I let her play as a cyclops, again?\n\nOur squishy employer was less fortunate, catching a blast of nasty steam to the face. Despite her flamey appearance, she was still affected by heat damage- just less so than other creatures. McFlamy insisted that we continue on, and not worry about her until we found her sister Dryad. But first, weird puzzles! Spotting an oddly-colored wall, Pratena found a button that made part of it slide aside and reveal a weird, shiny hallway with a right angle turn at the end. Needless to say, everyone mistrusted the SHIT out of this... so Pratena hucked Buster the Corpse at it and watched what happened.\n\nWhat happened was Buster slid on the slick floor, whanged his head against the far wall, and slid right back. Pratena decided this was AWESOME, and immediately jumped on Buster's back like a skateboard. She eased to a stop against the far wall, and glanced around a corner to find... some sort of weird altar. She couldn't see into it because of her small height, but she did decide that this was some magic-y stuff that probably warranted caution. So she tore off Buster's arm and hucked it at the altar, trying to see if it would do anything.\n\nThis proved more difficult than she had anticipated. The first toss whacked against the far wall, missing the altar completely... so Pratena just tore off more of Buster's arm and kept hucking until something interesting happened. The second toss bounced off the altar, the third actually splatted into Pratena's hair, and the fourth failed so completely that it flew off and splatted into Rose's faceplate. Blinded, rose panicked and ran face-first into a wall, denting her helmet. After a brief, sheepish set of pantomimed apologies, Pratena finally managed to huck a bit of Buster into the bowl on top of the weird altar.\n\nNothing happened. So Pratena ventured out onto the (CRAZY slick) floor and worked her way up the altar to peek inside. What she found was a puddle of weird liquid and a strange orb. When she grabbed at the orb, it shot out of her hands like a bullet and the cloudy liquid in the bowl started to recede. Hm.\n\nAfter desecrating Buster the Corpse a bit more, she wrapped the supernaturally slick orb in the dead man's shirt and returned with the spoils. A bit of Science later, everyone concluded that this was an Orb of Grease, and that they should probably keep it away from McFlamy, because the grease easily caught fire.\n\nA bit more exploring, and the party found a button that moved yet another wall to access yet another secret area. Trouble was that this button was quite obviously a trap, because the wall would move in and crush whoever pressed it. The old bloodstains and bone fragments were a dead giveaway. So they stood back and hucked Buster at it. One crunchy splat later, the passage was open, and Buster had been reduced to a mangled set of legs. And that STILL wasn't the end of him...\n\nAt the end of this passage was some sort of grassy, woodsy cave that had somehow managed to support a tiny little forest without any obvious light source. According to McFlamy, this was their destination- the enslaved Dryad was here. All they had to do was lure it out of hiding and keep it busy while McFlamy identified and torched the plant that had dominated her sister Dryad. This was difficult, as the Dryad was crazy evasive in her natural environment and could only reliably be spotted when she started to harass the party with arrows. Oh, and there were tree-men, too. Did I not mention those? Because they were assholes. According to Pratena, they didn't even taste good. But the party hunkered down and torched, bit and stabbed the tree dudes until they stopped being collosal assholes and started being dead. That done, Rose covered McFlamy with her shield while she completed a particularly potent spell turned one of the bigger bushes into a column of fire.\n\nThe enslaved Dryad immediately caught fire herself and fell to the ground, convulsing. McFlamy gently helped her up with her typical snarling bedside manner, and thanked the party for their assistance. But the party wasn't done- there was still more loot to be had! They snatched up the staff that was sitting on the weird nature-y altar and then Pratena coated the entire place with tendrils of grease while the liberated Dryad teamed up with McFlamy to give the fiery finger to this particular slice of woodlands. Good times.\n\nThere was still a bit more in the dungeon, though- after finding a couple of suspicious dead-endy hallways, they split up momentarily to investigate. Pratena hucked the mangled legs of Buster onto a pressure plate but failed to account for the location of the connected dart trap, and became very briefly poisoned. Not that it mattered, she just healed so fast that the two forces cancelled eachother out. As for Rose, she had triggered a trap that deployed a mess of tiny floorspikes that acted like caltrops. Rose, being a suit of empty armor, did not have even a single care and proceeded to dance a merry jig on top of them to spite the designers of this dumbass ruin. At the end of both hallways was a suspicious wall that didn't look like the rest- on closer inspection, it was a painted piece of plywood that had just been made to look like a stone wall and then propped agasint the end of the two corridors.\n\nBeyond that was some NEFARIOUS UNDEAD- a couple of zombies guarding a coffin. Rose was a bit freaked out by this and started trembling, but zombies are terminally stupid, and they just stood there while McFlamy marched up to lend assistance in the form of a fireball. This turned the zombies (and Buster's poor, mutilated remains) into chunky salsa, but now there was a new problem- the minor lich that had just been very rudely awoken from his nice nap. The lich thrust a hand forward and did some soul-magicy shit to McFlamy while Rose watched the whole sequence of events, wobbling and jangling like a gimp in a wind turbine. McFlamy collapsed, groaning, while Pratena demonstrated once again that she was the powerhouse of the party, charging straight at the lich with the intention of biting its creepy little face off. She missed, but her murderhobo heroism got Rose back into gear and she whanged the lich's face with a shield charge. He countered, but Rose blocked it and Pratena ate him.\n\nThe party took the lich's creepy magic-y shit and called it a day. Rose was feeling some of the combat damage and McFlamy was still reeling from that soul-judo-whatsit, so they decided to make a camp in the little ramp leading up to the ruin doors. But there were odd sounds in the surrounding forest- and not just because Pratena had decided to go grab a midnight snack...\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Good people, bad intentions\", COLD HARD CASH AND HUNTING GONE WRONG!](http://redd.it/2oqfiq)",

Another PC, Bill the Caitiff, had confessed to a bunch of murders in front of the rest of the PCs who restrained and staked him. Bill's Player had a back-up character in mind. \n\nThe PCs, absent Bill, dragged his staked body away through the storm sewers until they could get away from the fire in the residential neighborhood. They stood over Bill's staked body and debated what had just happened. None of them wanted to go back to their own Havens because they believed, perhaps rightly so, that the Sabbat were watching them. They knew that they'd killed at least two of them, but there had been at least five who attacked the house. Madelyn summoned a Retainer with a car and they all got away... straight to the Tower of London. \n\nThey figured that the Tremere could keep them safe, and Des gave them an in, right?   \n\nWell, sort of. On their way there, they call the Prince and give him a quick run-down, re: the dead Sheriff and the Sabbat attack. The Prince agrees to meet them at the Tower. Once there, another Tremere comes out to talk - the head of the Chantry was somewhat reclusive. While Des had seen him, he avoided contact with pretty much *everyone*. \n\nMadelyn and Will present an elaborate story detailing how Bill the Caitiff was a Sabbat spy, how he'd betrayed them to the Sabbat, and how they'd captured him. They also detailed the Sheriff's death and Scott's ability to immediately step into his place. Scott... stayed out of the way and didn't draw attention to himself. I think he even snuck away under the pretext of making sure no one else was watching. \n\nThe Prince accepted Scott becoming the new Sheriff - he needed someone to keep the Nosferatu in line in any case. Instead of killing Bill the Caitiff, the Coterie handed him off to the Tremere, trusting them to keep him bound and confined and hopefully able to get some information out of him. \n\nThus, a new PC came in. Wilhelm the Tremere. \n\n***\n\nThis new PC was not quite as bad as Bill the Caitiff, but it was close. At least it was a Camarilla Clan. However, it had the flaw Permanent Wound. Wilhelm was confined to a wheel-chair with an oxygen tank on the back. (there were some jokes about Professor X) The oxygen tank (of course) was actually filled with blood and thus Wilhelm carried a few points with him. He had lots of points in Tremere clan status - not enough to be the Regent, but not far below him. He was ostensibly sent from Vienna in order to help secure the city against the Sabbat.      \nThe Tremere regent in the city hated him, almost from the start. Des, who was only allowed in they city because of the sufferance of the Tremere Regent was uneasy around him. With Wilhelm's high Auspex and Dominate, Scott was concerned about his recent Diablerie being discovered. Some of the Players voiced the sudden concern that Wilhelm would only attempt to set Bill the Caitiff free.      \nBut, Wilhelm was going to be better.\n\n*** \n\nHaving struck out in the open, the Sabbat stepped up their assault on the city. There were at least a pair of mass embraces and the formation of some small assault packs. \n\nDuring the next two or three game sessions, there were small attacks almost any time any of the PCs were alone or in the Underground (in pairs sometimes). There was another PC not mentioned in part one who died during these assaults; the Player didn't make a new PC because he had to leave the game for outside reasons. His character died atop one of the bridges over the Thames in a fiery blast, but he took out at least two Sabbat as well. \n\nDuring this time (about three games past the assault on the House), Scott revealed (first to Des, then to Will) his Diablerie. He wanted their help to develop the third eye and use it to its fullest. Since neither Des nor Will knew Valeran (of course), they instead taught him Auspex. Scott was getting really good at what the Sabbat had wanted him for - hiding and watching. \n\nAlso during this time, Des was trying to get closer to the Sabbat Regent - partly as a hedge against Wilhelm and Madelyn (who openly distrusted the Tremere as a good Ventrue should). She wasn't able to get too close to him, but she did learn that he was the oldest Vampire in London, older than the Prince and in fact older than the Battle of Hastings. This was a big thing that went totally unremarked.\n\nWill was finding the city more and more cut-off. This helped drive his prices up, but he was finding it harder and harder to get stuff in. Trying to secure avenues for his black-market goods were increasingly difficult (that's what led to the death of that unnamed character on the bridge I mentioned above). \n\nAnd then... there was Josh.\n\nJosh was barely hanging on. His Malkavian was essentially doing odd jobs for everyone else, essentially unseen and unremembered. Josh's Player had found out about Scott's Diablerie (but Josh didn't know of course). Since Scott hadn't had any adverse effects, Josh's Player was seriously looking to go down the same route. The problem was, he wasn't really a fighter. He had some Auspex, some Dementation, some Dominate, some Obfuscate. But he wasn't really *good* at anything in particular.      \n\nAnd then, he got lucky.   \n\nDuring an assault on a cell of Sabbat that Scott had uncovered, Josh stumbled upon one of the Sabbat while they were *both* trying to flee the battle. Both weakened, Josh attacked him, looking to get some Vitae back... and then, he did the horrid deed himself. \n\nIt didn't quite go as well for Josh as it had for Scott. Not quite so well by far. ",

        "text": "&gt; I've mentioned this story a few times, but never in as much detail. It's my favorite because it's about my first ever D&amp;D 3.5 character.\n\nWe had just moved from AD&amp;D 2e to 3.5, and to help us out our DM made some pre-generated characters for us. We had a party of five people total. OUr party consisted of:\n\n* **Augustus Evensworth**, human paladin of Heironeous and full fledged member of the Fun Police.\n* **Brother Willam \"Bellringer\" Berringer**, naive teenage human cleric. Called Bellringer because his bodyguard could never care to recall his actual name.\n* **Fendrick Ironfist**, dwarf rogue, who constantly straddled the line between hardened battle scout and craven thief. As far as we know the last of his kind. Also secretly a female.\n* **Eledrin Goldmyre**, elf wizard looking for any form of obscure magic to restore his homeland to its former glory.\n* **and Burton LaMonte**, my character, a human fighter, who was a duelist mercenary working as a bodyguard for Bellringer.\n\nWe met in a fairly large desert town as circumstances brought us together. After routing some common street thugs, Augustus asks us to join him at the tavern, as he wants to discuss something with us. He'll even pay for us. Fendrick and Eledrin won't turn down a free drink, and Bellringer is completely enamored with the Paladin, so I can't say no and leave my meal ticket alone.\n\nSo while we nurse our drinks, Augustus tells us about an artifact that was stolen from the town. A magic item that allows them to have a constant supply of fresh water, and without which the town will die and be abandoned within a fortnight. The council has offered a reward for the return of the artifact, and the Paladin asks us to undertake the mission with him. Fendrick accepts because reward, Eledrin is also game so that he can maybe study the artifact before returning it. I don't want to, and I try to remind my ward that we have our own agenda. But he's fanboying too hard over the Paladin now, so I have to relent. After all, Burton LaMonte never breaks a contract.\n\nSo we trek out into the gods-forsaken wastes in search of a bandit camp. We find the cave, and Fendrick gets dropped by an ogre's spear as s/he is checking for traps. After killing the ogre and resting up, we head in to get the artifact. The dungeon is unremarkable to say the least, and we finish off the bugbear bandit leader in due course. We find the artifact, an Eversoaking Sponge, along with quite a bit of pilfered treasure and goods. We split everything as evenly as possible based on who wants what, with the exception of one thing. A [Fiery Yellow Corundum](http://images.wikia.com/forgottenrealms/images/archive/5/54/20110918132333!ShouLung-topaz1.jpg) the size of a man's fist. Both Burton and Fendrick want it, and we get into a pretty loud yelling match over it. Eledrin and Bellringer both give up the right to it, so it's just down to me and the dwarf. Or so I think. So we decide to roll dice in-character for it.\n\nAugustus comes between us before we roll, demanding the we sell the gem and split the profits evenly between us. But no, Burton's honor is on the line and he wants the damned corundum. So the Paladin gets in on the dice rolling, hoping to win it and enact his fair judgement. Burton ends up winning the gem, feeling pretty good about himself. But on the way back to town, Augustus continues to hound him about doing the \"right and fair thing.\"\n\nBy the time we get back, Burton is pretty pissed at the Paladin's disregard for him winning the gem and the blatant bullying over the matter. So I tell the DM that I want to find the best smith that the town has to offer, and start sketching out a design. Now, I haven't mentioned it yet, but Burton wore an eyepatch. Not because he was missing an eye or anything practical, but because he thought it made him look damn sexy. So using his portion of the treasure, Burton commissions a polished steel eyepatch with the corundum cut and set into the front of it. Very fancy overall. He also buys some nicer aristocrats clothes, because he wants to live the high life. Barely enough gold to keep himself housed and fed for the next few weeks, but he looks like the dashing rogue he believes he is.\n\nAugustus is furious, and tells Burton so. Blah, blah, blah, something about fiscal responsibility and humbleness. But who cares, we're the big damn heroes of the town, so Burton starts up his second obsession besides looking good: wooing women. Bellringer gets wasted with Fendrick and passes out. Eledrin slinks off with the Sponge to run some tests on it before we return it properly. And Augustus, in a move that shocked us, started chatting up the daughter of a well-to-do businessman. I'm still feeling kind of spiteful, so Burton slides in and starts with the wooing. Yeah, he's up against a Paladin in a battle of pick-up lines, but with 16 CHA himself he isn't very handicapped.\n\nAugustus ended up going to bed with the businessman's daughter, so Burton settled for a couple of serving girls. But there was bad blood between the two men from that day forward.\n\nFast forward to several weeks later, with a new job to check out where some caravans have gone missing to. We find an orc raiding party that has set up camp in some old dwarven ruins, and we make our advance slowly. Fendrick goes down yet again to a poison trap that s/he didn't detect, but we get him back in fighting condition as we continue forward. Our fight takes us to a ravine with a rope bridge separates us from the rest o the orcs and their potential prisoners. We kill a few of the orcs but one gets to the other side and cuts the rope on the bridge before running further into the ruins.\n\nWith the bridge half broken, there's no way that we can all make it across, especially Augustus in his full plate. So Burton volunteers to tie a rope around himself, cross the broken bridge, and try to fix it on the other side. About halfway across, the bridge snaps under my weight, and the rest of the party braces to hold me up. However, only one character has the strength score to keep Burton from falling to his death: Augustus.\n\nBurton yells for them to pull him up, and he hears a long and well-planned speech from Augustus above. About how Burton doesn't respect his authority or how he revels in debauchery and selfish excess while Augustus tries to set an example for them all. How Burton exploits Bellringer for money for beer and loose women. All of which were technically true. I was expecting him to demand an apology. But no, he offers an even worse ultimatum. Augustus said that the weight of my pride was keeping him from being able to pull me up, and that I would have to drop my eyepatch down the ravine.\n\nNow was Burton's turn to monologue. But instead of a lengthy speech, I just told the Paladin where he could shove his longsword. Then he let go of the rope. The other characters quickly followed suit, lest they be pulled down with me. Burton LaMonte died that day, or so they thought, and the campaign was pretty much over because we'd unfortunately let our little character drama spill over somewhat into our personal lives, and the DM wanted us to work it out before we kept playing. But he was my first character in a modern D20 edition, and he's still my favorite.",

We play with a massive damage rule. If you take 50% or more of your health in one attack you are forced to make a fortitude save. The save is base DC 15, can be higher, but only in exceptional circumstances.*  \n*2. Players who arrive on time are given 1 reroll per session, Players who are late do not. Players who have a reroll who do not use it bank a bonus 50xp*  \n*3. Spells higher than 4th level aren't castable with a few exceptions, like restoration that requires a feat, a 6th level divine caster and 9 ranks in heal, and is only castable 1/day as an hour long ritual, similar for stone to flesh. Another option is any spell can be cast through incantations, rituals that take days to learn, hours to cast, require multiple skill checks and ritual ingrediants but can be cast by anyone. See the SRD for the Incantations variant. (I also use the sacrifice rules from the BoVD to allow evil characters to cast Wish and whatnot.)  \n  \n\n**Session 18**  \n  \nNow, the group's guide has managed to keep them out of the worst of the winds, navigated down to the third layer, Phlegethon through a few winding tunnels and Gates. As they step out into the layer he turn to them and takes out his earplugs and warns them of the wild magic pockets. Using magic items is dangerous and spells can have unintended side effects.  \n  \nThe party soldier on and they're attacked by a Grey Slaad with a Green Slaad bodyguard. The old man hides, ready to defend himself, but he's not getting killed for some random adventurers. Azrael wins the initiative, decides to cast a defensive spell as he moves away from the party, he throws up a Mirror Image and gets lucky, rolling a 4 on his D4, suddenly there are 9 Sorcerers. I ask Azrael to roll for Wild Magic, he suddenly remembers about Wild Magic and rolls. the result:  \n&gt;10ft Radius Burst of Steam centred on Target  \nIt doesn't list a damage, I decide 3d6 is fair (1d6 per 2 CL), and I roll, I roll a 14. I announce that a puff of smoke appears with the images, not enough to obscure vision, but it's noticeable...and it's hot, and Azrael takes 14 fire damage from the steam. Azrael looks at me concerned. **\"I only have 25 hp\"**.  \nNow Azrael has failed every save he's ever rolled... and I don't think I'm even exaggerating, he is magically gullible, constitutionally inept and about as nimble as a coma patient.  \nSo it turns out he's got a 45% chance of failure when it comes to his massive damage save. He rolls a 3, people facepalm, I remind him he has not used his session reroll. He beams with confidence, snatches up his d20 and gloriously tosses the die, the icosahedron majestically soars, tumbles, spins and displays the brilliant and unmistakable digit, the number 1.  \nAzrael laughs, sighs, and requests to play his familiar for the rest of the session. I agree and now Azrael is Whitefang, the Albino Blinkdog.  \nI describe to the group as they see their magnificent sorcerer conjure magic out of the very air of chaos about them, creating 8 images of himself, accompanied by smoke and... watch their friend and colleague boiled alive 9 times, albeit simultaneously.  \n  \nthe rest of the combat goes reasonably well... people still use magic, as a result:  \nFortinbras's scales are now Black in direct natural sunlight, as opposed to their normal silver/blue sheen.  \nFortinbras can now vomit sawdust 1/day permanently, in addition to his other breath weapons.  \nBaha Abdur fell into a deep depression and believed his soul was permanently destroyed... then he snapped out of it.  \nThe [Survival Pouch](https://valcia-pitt.obsidianportal.com/items/survival-pouch-one), that can also summon mules, was being carried by a mule, referred to as Barry. Twisted by a hit of wild magic Barry is now a Sentient Magic Item. Rather than despawning he is permanent, he is fused to his saddlebags which act as the Survival Pouch and a Bag of Holding. He is Barry the Survival Pouch of Holding Mule.  \nOh and someone, somewhere now really hates Norril for some reason.  \n  \n  \nSo the group loads the body of their beloved friend into Barry's survival pouch of holding (and no one knows he's now a magic item), and make way to the inn they were told about. Their guide parts ways and heads back to the circus upon arrival and receiving the rest of his fee.  \n  \nThe Inn is trashed and expensive, multiple shady characters stare at the party and the innkeeper wants 50 gold per beer that is served in a dirty, broken glass. The Party decide to leave and start exploring themselves, rather than stay here.  \n  \nThey explore and they discover the Ingress's cave using the directions they were given. They find a disgusting blob that lifts it's folds and dozens of creatures scurry out, making gestures towards their mouths. The party begin to hand over food. Kurask getting angry at the little creatures, but Norril thinking \"why not\", once they handed over every scrap of food on them the little creatures began forcing it into the huge blob's mouth.\n  \nSated, the blob (Ingress Mother) commands the minions to take the adventurer's where they want to go. The ingress never speak, so the party are bemused, looking at the Gremlins they tell them \"We seek the wand of orcus\" and without ceremony the Ingress dogpile them. covering them and pushing them into the ground, the player's feel like their bodies become liquid and they get the disconcerting feeling like they are flowing through rock, blind, dumb and deaf.  \n  \nA minute...or hour... or however long later the party are physical again and in a little pain, as they end up in a heap on a cavern floor. Norril unsheathes Merthuvial for some light, and they assume they're in the cavern where the Wand of Orcus is hidden... or they hope so at least. They begin to explore, mapping out the place roughly as they go.  \n  \nFortinbras is in the rear of the party. He feels a hand clasp over his mouth from behind and he is pulled away from the group. It doesn't last long however as he decides to breathe fire, burning the hand and alerting the group. The party see a Half-Ogre, dressed in vestments, clutching his hand in pain. \"Stooop, I seek the Wand of Orcus, it is dangerous!\" he yells.  \nFortinbras wants to hear him out, however Kurask detects evil and the Half-Ogre is. Kurask tells Fortinbras \"Kill him, he's evil\".  \nTo which the Half-Ogre Cleric of Orcus decides the appropriate response is \"DIE IN THE NAME OF ORCUS\" and death touches Fortinbras, who takes some Necrotic damage and then the party proceed to attack the Cleric.  \n  \nAs the Cleric is defeated he fades away, and a solid knowledge check reveals that was actually an astral projection of the Cleric, which is a high level incantation and not exactly magic that gets used a lot or without careful thought and planning.  \n  \nThe party finish mapping the area and discover the wand's antechamber, which seems to have a wall of force blocking their entry, they find multiple entrances to the wand's antechamber, but all blocked by walls of force. The party have a couple choices, work out how to disable the walls, or put together a highly risky incantation to cast disintegrate, a high level spell. the party think about it.  \n  \n  \n**Session 19**  \nThe party try smashing the wall of force with magic weapons to no avail, but they also try smashing it with some of the bones littered around the caverns and they seem to have an effect. The wall of force dissipates and the party step through, the [Wand of Orcus](http://i.imgur.com/pvxp88k.png) is in front of them on a pedestal, radiating evil.  \n  \nAfter a lot of talking and discussing the decide to pick up the obsidian heavy mace, Baha Abdur touches it, receives many painful mind images, takes a bunch of physic damage and stops touching it. Claiming he saw the rod kill things that touch it, the skull on top the rod is from a Paladin, he saw the evil it has done and is capable of.  \nFortinbras steps forth and lifts the wand, he gets the same images but saves against the damage. They smash the skull off the wand and put the wand in Barry's Survival pouches of Holding, with the corpse of Azrael...  \nThey're pretty sure holding the wand outside of this realm would kill them, and it is very powerful. (They don't know this but it's a +6 Heavy Mace, with other properties.)  \n  \nThey then smash the gem of random teleportation.  \n  \nThey appear in the middle of a cave, in the middle of an ongoing combat.  \nA Dwarf (Azreal's new character) is fighting a Half-Troll Hill Giant, with four more normal Hill Giants ready to sling boulders at him. The party decide that the Hill Giants have appeared to ambushed the Dwarf, and general clues like human bones on their leathers seem to indicate the Giants are evil-ish. The group is inbetween the dwarf and incoming boulders too... so they're now in the fight if they like it or not.  \n  \nA hard fight ensues and party members come close to death. Ragnam fights the half-troll and the party take the rest. Ragnam gets low, down to about 5hp, when loses his shield (Giant tosses it away following a successful disarm), Ragnam decides to overrun the Half Troll Giant, knocking him to the ground and keeps going, picking up his shield. Next round he ensures he stays down with an attack of opportunity and finishes off the giant with a hefty blow to the downed thing's head. They loot a magic ring from the half-troll hill giant and determine it to be a ring of regeneration with some knowledge arcana checks. [They don't realise it's cursed though...](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2nnyhd/my_cursed_item_have_you_got_any_favourites/)  \n  \nRagnam explains to the party the Hill Giants captured some humans and he's trying to save them, the party follow him into the cave and they discover the camp, a half-hill giant is cooking a pig over a spit roast and is carving some off for the humans. The party confront him and he introduces himself as Dundook explains he's the son of the half-troll hill giant but he hates that they push him around and hurt people, he just wants to run away and become a chef. Kurask doesn't detect any evil and the prisoners confirm he was nice to them, so they let him go. He packs up his things, shows the party where all the loot is kept and leaves, thanking the party for freeing him. The party make camp in the cave and prepare to take the villagers home in the morning. They also realise they're on the prime material and not too far from home...but it will be at least a week or two travel by horse...and they haven't got any horses.  \n  \n  \n[Next](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2pd4nz/saving_a_soul_from_hades_part_ten_dd_35e_e6/)",

        "author": "writermonk",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2nm9t5/vtm_a_comedy_of_errors_new_blood/",
        "text": "In [Part One](http://np.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2nffmg/vtm_a_comedy_of_errors/) we introduced our cast of characters.     \nIn [Part Two](http://np.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2nhi76/vtm_a_comedy_of_errors_mysterious_deaths/) we learned a bit more about what was going on in the plot. \n\n***\n\nSo, Bill the Caitiff had launched into a habit of killing off NPCs. For the next four or five game sessions, he'd target NPCs that he thought no one would miss. He'd try different \"tactics\" that all amounted to the same thing - get someone alone on different pretexts (\"I need your help\", \"I'm supposed to tell you something in secret\", \"We can defend one another.\") and then attack them. He wasn't offing an NPC every game session, but it was close. \n\nIn the meantime, the PCs were all pursuing individual goals while at the same time keeping an eye out for the Sabbat. Every so often, new rumors would surface and swirl about more and more disappearances and deaths in the city. Fear of the Sabbat was growing and intensifying. \n\nDuring this time Scott (the Samedi) was getting closer and closer to the Nosferatu Sheriff. He was working to become a sort of Kindred boogey-man, hiding in the shadows, tracking and observing, reporting back. He was also increasingly frustrated at not being able to catch the Sabbat. \n\nUntil about the fourth game - he garnered some intelligence that hinted that the Sabbat were using the Underground to not only move around the city undetected, but were also using abandoned stations and dead end tracks as temporary havens. Before he told the Sheriff, he warned his Coterie to not enter the Underground unless they went as a group.     \nBill the Caitiff thought that this was a threat pointed directly at himself since he had used the Underground as a place to attack and later dump bodies unseen. He was sure that the other PCs were on to his plot and he didn't think he was strong enough to take them all on. (He was right about that last part at least.)      \nIn the meantime, neither Bill nor Scott was aware that they themselves had both been observed in the Underground by the very Sabbat they were hunting. Unbeknownst to anyone, there were actually two Sabbat cells in the city - one that had been there for a great deal of time watching and taking notes and one that was newly arrived to stir up trouble. The pack of watchers had seen Bill killing off Kindred, knew of his disfavor in the city, and wanted to recruit him into the pack of trouble-makers. Scott had been seen as well and they wanted to subvert him and get him to join the watchers.  \n\nScott goes off to tell the Nosferatu Sheriff about Sabbat using the Underground while the other PCs decide they need to get some sort of communal haven so that they won't get picked off one by one like other Kindred in the city. \n\nThey ask Bill to find them a place. \n\nSo, Bill (with his rapidly dwindling Humanity score) keeps up his murder spree - he finds a house, kills the mortal inhabitants inside, dumps their bodies in a drainage culvert nearby, and then calls up the others to give them the address. The entire time he's doing this he's being watched, only this time he notices.     \nSort of.\n\nHe was being watched by animals - rats, cats, stray dogs, squirrels, even pigeons. Normal city animals, but not necessarily all ones you'd find in a residential area at night. Bill thinks its odd, but ignores it. \n\nThe PCs each arrive at the House via different means. We play out each one getting there so that they have a chance to notice the surveillance by animals. They notice all right. They even correctly piece together that it's likely the Sabbat who are watching them when they compare notes while in the House. Everyone but Scott has made it and they're starting to wonder if he's been captured. \n\nI switch back over to Scott. He's coming back to the House (the table/room breathes a sigh of relief) and I describe how he's coming through the storm sewers and he finds the exsanguinated bodies of several humans (the family from the House, Bill's handiwork). He calls Will (the Ravnos) on a cell phone and information is quickly passed back and forth. Then ... Scott's phone goes silent. \n\n***\n\nNow at this point, a big set piece battle begins. The Sabbat, in order to get at these two Kindred, decide to kill off the other members of the coterie and kidnap Bill and Scott so that they can do some brain-washing and conversion. \n\nAt the House, this starts when Bill sees someone sneaking up towards the House from outside. In the storm-drain, this starts when someone snatches Scott's phone and smashes it against a wall. \n\nThe battle at the House is about as violent as you'd expect a fight between two large groups of Kindred to be - there are about 10 Vampires battling one another, violently, with powers and such in full effect. The Sabbat quickly start separating the PC Coterie as much as they can, herding lone members into other rooms, out on the lawn, and so on, aided in this by strategically setting fire to parts of the house.      \nIn the sewer, Scott is grappling with another Sabbat who keeps talking while they're locked in a Greek wrestling style struggle. I had Scott's player in another room and I'd step in every round and go over what the Sabbat was saying to him. It was clearly trying to recruit him, doing its best to point out that Scott was nothing but a pawn and that even with all the deaths and disappearances in the city no one was going to help the 'little guy', that the Prince only cared about his own, etc. The Sabbat actually got the upper hand and pinned Scott to the wall, holding him there with prodigious strength. Then a third eye opened in the Sabbat's forehead and he started to speak into Scott's mind (Salubri antitribu with a lot of Auspex). Scott snarls a lot, tells the guy that no one looks out for the Nosferatu and that they'll all take care of themselves. The Sabbat retorts that he knows all about the Nosferatu because he'd been following and tracking Scott this whole time. Still holding Scott to the wall, the Sabbat kicks open a satchel and exposes the rapidly rotting head of the Nosferatu Sheriff (who'd been Scott's mentor for a bit as you recall). Scott flips his shit. \n\nIn the House, Madelyn realizes that this has all gone to hell. She starts shouting commands over the noise, trying to get the Coterie to abandon the House and meet up in the street outside. Josh is the first one to her and the two of them start trying to Dominate and Presence and manipulate the neighbors into helping put out the fire and ignore the obviously supernatural stuff going on (gotta preserve the Masquerade). Eventually, they all make it out to the street - many of them badly hurt. Bill is the last one out because all this time his opponent has been trying to convince him to join the Sabbat. Bill's answer has pretty much been 'fuck you, you're just a different kind of Prince'. Until, that is, when the two of them crash out of an upstairs window, roll off the roof, and land in the front yard. They stand up, and the Sabbat makes one last plea to join him and cast aside the weak-hearted Camarilla. He even points out Josh trying to save people in nearby houses. Bill snarls, spits at the guys feet, and says that he's strong enough himself to do what he wants, that he's a better killer than the Sabbat, and starts naming off all the kills he's made personally that the Sabbat are taking credit for.      \nYes. In front of his own Coterie.     \nThe Sabbat smiles and goes *poof* turning into a pile of shadow and vanishing. \n\nAt that point, Scott re-joins the group. (when I say this, even Scott's Player is surprised). He's apparently heard all of this and he quietly says, \"Des. Tentacles.\" Des does her Obtenebration stuff (yes, out in public) and binds Bill. Scott walks over and stakes him, then throws him over his shoulder. He turns around to the Coterie and says \"There's a new Sheriff in town. Get all of this cleaned up and meet me downstairs in 15 minutes.\" And then he walks over to an open storm drain and drops down. \n\nThe Players freak out. I pull Bill and Scott aside, send them to separate rooms, tell the others that their characters can hear and see the lights of fire engines and police coming closer. They scramble to Dominate mortals into forgetting, grab their stuff, and get out of sight as quick as they can. \n\nI got to Scott's Player and tell him how his Frenzy played out and how he beat the Sabbat agent. I then tell him that when he comes out of Frenzy, he was standing over the body of the Sabbat and it was nearly drained of Vitae. That he had a choice on how to kill him. Scott asked if Diablerie was an option. I stopped, I went over all the bad things that Diablerie entails (I had some house rules on the subject). He weighed his options and went for it. I told him we'd deal with all those rolls later, but to assume that the Sabbat agent is dead.      \nI bring the other Players (not Bill) in with Scott. Scott shows them the head of the (now former) Sheriff and says that he's going to use what pull he has to take his place. It will get them all closer to the Prince and he already knows most of the Sheriff's tricks and contacts from his time working with him. He asks them, however, what should be done with Bill. \n\nThere is a lot of debate. While the Players are bickering (some in-character some out-of-character) about it, I go to Bill and explain that his confession in front of the coterie may have sealed his doom. Bill's player doesn't care. 'I've got a great idea for my next character\" he says. *WTF?!* \n\nPlayers, man. They do it to you every time. ",

        "text": "So, for my D+D game EVER, I decided to be a Tiefling Cleric--Born of a demon, dedicated to spreading the word of my chosen god. However, that wasn't self-contradictory enough for me. So, I decided that Charybdis (Yes, I like that name) would be constantly at war with herself, struggling with her demonic nature and lineage, trying to do the right thing. I dedicated Charybdis to Ioun, the true-neutral god of learning and knowledge. I suppose I tried a little too hard to do stuff, and my dice hated me. I really pissed off the DM.\n\nAt one point, the group was looking around some ruins. No action, no hint of danger, just looking around for a secret door or something. I rolled badly on the Perception check, so, while everyone else was looking at the magical runes that were probably protecting a door, I was wandering around the other side of the ruins, looking at nothing in particular. This was the last straw for the DM.\n\nThe party managed to open the door, and was going down the stairs. At the top, the DM stopped the action and said \"Charybdis, roll.\" He didn't even tell me what to roll for, just \"roll.\" So I did. Apparently I didn't roll high enough.\n\n\"Charybdis is now possessed by a demon.\" No warning. No event. No trap triggered or demonic force to be fought. Just out of the blue, random demon possession. I tried to convince it to leave, but didn't roll high enough on the Diplomacy check.\n\nAt this point, the party's resident mage piped up with a suggestion: \"I get the rope out of the adventurer's kit, and hog-tie Charybdis.\" The DM allowed it. So, the party had to drag the bound-and-gagged Tiefling along with them. I struggled, to no avail. I thought I would have to just sit out for a while. But, no, the DM wasn't done screwing with me yet.\n\nPresumably, at this point Charybdis was getting extremely uncomfortable. So, she begged to be released. The DM made me roll a Diplomacy check for that. I rolled ... a natural 20. Which translates to \"Seduction.\"\n\nApparently, I seduced the also-female mage who had suggested tying me up in the first place. We apparently had extremely kinky lesbian sex, involving a waterskin. (The discussion of this part belongs on a different subreddit.) The rest of the party was watching the whole thing.\n\nThis happened several more times over the course of the campaign. Nothing ever caused the demon to come. I would just randomly be possessed by a demon. Also, as a Cleric, I had a higher-than-necessary Charisma bonus. So, even when I didn't manage to roll a natural 20, I managed to seduce the other person. Every. Single. Time.",

        "text": "[Another tale of that magical time that I got to GM a game!](http://redd.it/2niaif) For those of you who weren't here last time, my ~~victims~~ players consist of a gillman sorcerer who wants to be an astronaut (Fishnaut), and a greasy summoner who *really enjoys* the company of his female Eidolon (Sleazeball). Last time, they met, got all chummy, and made a daring escape from the world's shittiest swamp, and then wound up on some really boring grasslands. Not seeing any other landmarks, they set off into the nearby woods in search of civilization.\n\nOnce in the woods, they very quickly came across a wierd scuffle- drawn by a scream, they happened upon a clearing where a dude in shiny armor and a dude in urine-soaked armor were facing down some sort of abomination that looked like a human that had been bisected cleanly down the middle, with a hideously frightening maw and an uncanny sense of balance. The half-freak was advancing on the urine-soaked soldier, grinning evilly, and the shiny armor dude was furiously trying to grab his weapon off the ground. The party thought it best to lend a hand, and sent the Eidolon in to lend a helping claw. A whopping four damage later, the half-freak lazily twisted its head around backwards, looked into the Eidolon's dead, empty eyes, and screamed loud enough to blow out her eardrums and bladder. Paralyzed, the Eidolon was out of combat for the forseeable future. The half-freak maliciously advanced on the squishy casters crouching in the bush...\n\nThe shining-armor knight grabbed his mace and charged in, only to trip on an exposed root and make friends with a patch of briars. The half-freak screamed in the faces of both casters, looking sort of puzzled when neither of them had the usual wet-pants reaction. So the half-freak tried to bite Sleazeball instead. It missed, but only barely. Now terrified for completely non-supernatural reasons, the casters backed the hell up and pelted the thing with poorly-aimed crossbow bolts and piddly acid splashes. The half-freak was becoming annoyed... which is why it was very fortunate that the shining armor knight finally managed to locate his posterior using both of his gleaming gauntlets, and charged in to deal a whallop on the half-freak's head with his mace, dealing a whole d6 of damage. What the hell kind of knight weilds a LIGHT mace?\n\nThe half-freak, irate, returned its attention to the knight and dinked ineffectually at his armor with its freak-mouth and freak-claws. While this was going on, the party was still throwing acid splashes (and tiny, piddly meteors) at the half-freak by way of support. The battle was finally going south for the abomination, and it decided cowardice was the better part of staying alive, and fled the scene. Or tried, because at that point the Eidolon had gotten over her mortal fear and was rightfully pissed. They made sure to hack at the body long after it looked dead, just to be safe.\n\nThe gleaming knight helped up his besodden comrade, and profusely thanked the party for their assistance ending that \"unholy abomination\" (this was the part where the party notices the religious iconography all over the knight's armor, even the crotchplate). The gleaming knight then pleads with the party to come with him back to his hometown, for they are in need of assistance that only men such as they can provide. Eager to not have to dine on flavorless rations AGAIN, the party merrily agrees and hops into the knights' horse-drawn cart. On the way, the party tried to make conversation with the gleaming knight, only to find that he was weirdly downcast for some reason. Upon closer inspection, his weapons and armor were made of bronze, the shittiest metal in all existence. For all the world, it looked like someone had just beaten his armor agasint a rock until it was roughly the right shape, then spit-polished it and scratched some religious iconography onto it. When they asked about the knight's obvious faith, they were met with more sadness, and a brief tale of times past when the knight's god was the talk of the town and things were better.\n\nThe journey passed in relative peace, with the knight just sitting there looking sullen and Fishnaut sternly demanding that he get to drive the cart for a while (he eventually got to). Despite some iffy feelings about this whole business and glimpses of something metal flashing in the woods, they safely arrived at the knights' hometown... a collection of dirty, filthy hovels filled with dirty, filthy people who had this weird hunted look and a tendency to start coughing up weird blue mucus. It seemed impossible, but it was an even bigger cesspit than the bog. Except for that weird gallows in the middle of it all, which seemed oddly clean and well-maintained...\n\nAnd this was the part where the shiny knight started apologizing to our two casters while gauntleted hands grabbed everyone. See, their god was a god of light and order, and he had very specific rules about inhuman creatures and those twisted by magic... they were finally going to regain his divine favor with the public execution of these three abominations. Then everything would be better. Then everything would go back to how it used to be.\n\nThe party had other ideas. Sleazeball was the only one who succeeded at not being grabbed, and he immediately cast Enlarge Person on his Eidolon. She easily broke free of the shiny knight's grasp, and knocked him back a few paces, and tore open one soldier's chest. Fishnaut tried to break free from his captor, but all he got was a whang over the head with a bronze mace. The soldier pinned him while the townsfolk rushed in, eager to lend a hand. Meanwhile, the shiny knight was getting up, and he set his dinky mace and prepared to charge Sleazeball...\n\nWhich is when he was suddenly impaled and hurtled backwards by something the size of a harpoon, moving at roughly Mach 1. The force was so great that he was launched backwards, into another villager, and the harpoon embedded in the boards of the gallows. Amazingly, the shiny knight was still alive. The Eidolon decided to press her advantage and moved in on the pinned knight, swiping at him with claws that occasionally got through his extensive but shoddy armor. Meanwhile, the villagers were ganging up on Fishnaut and trying to kick him, but whenever they had to move any distance, they descended into a coughing fit, and those that actually managed to swing their foot were hilariously inaccurate. Eventually, though, one of them managed to catch Fishnaut in the face and send him into unconsciousness... for all of about 4 seconds. Fishnaut decided it would be wise not to press his luck, and acted as though he had been subdued. With that, the soldier holding him passed the responsibility onto a limp-wristed farmer, and then he and rest of the villagers ganged up on Sleazeball. Sleazeball watched as the impaled shiny knight scored a couple of nasty hits on his Eidolon, shattering her kneecap and banishing her back to her home dimension. This wasn't good.\n\nBut Sleazeball set his jaw, drew upon his magic, and faced the villagers. He shouted, \"Foolish peasants! You think me defeated? I have enough arcane talent to bring this place to the ground! Feel my power!\" Hands glowing, he thrust them forward, summoning up...\n\nA rat.\n\nWhile everyone was looking at that, he bolted out of the village as fast as his weasally little legs could take him.\n\nSo the villagers ganged up on that, instead. The shiny knight finally managed to pull the harpoon free of the gallows, but he was losing a lot of blood... still, he wasn't about to lie down and OH GOD THE DEMON-RAT JUST ATE THAT GUY'S FACE KILL IT KILL IT! And thus began the legend of Configu- Contifger- Cofintger- LARRY the killer rat. After he had brought down one hapless villager with a savage bite, the shiny knight charged in and kicked it off, but it wasn't done- after that, Larry tore the eye out of the surviving soldier, horrifying most of the remaining villagers- and the shiny knight. Fishnaut seized his opportunity and shoved the dumbass farmer out of the world's weakest pin, and made a mad dash for the unattended horse that had been drawing the cart.\n\nAs the villagers tried to attack the rat without looking at it too hard (guess how that went), the shiny knight began to have serious doubts about this whole business. He tried to rally his comrades with an inspirational speech, but he wasn't fooling anyone, least of all himself. And while everyone was looking at the bloodsoaked murdermachine, Sleazeball had actually doubled back and decided to spawn a few more... and then Fishnaut cast Enlarge Person on the horse he was riding, and proceeded to smack its butt. The horse decided that all of this excitement was too much for one day, good sir, and wished to bid you all adieu. Fishnaut tumbled off into the mud with a splortch and a concussion, and the renegade horse unintentionally dragged the cart's wheels over a few of the villagers, flattening them.\n\nAll that was left was the shiny knight, and he was losing a tremendous amount of blood from the harpoon that was, might I remind you, *still in his chest*. As the cackling Sleazeball summoned more and more rats, the shiny knight's attacks started tapering off, and he finally collapsed backwards with a weary, tired sigh.\n\nSleazeball's player: \"Is he dead?\"\n\nDM: \"No, just unconscious-\"\n\n\"Then my rats bite him!\"\n\n\"...Roll a d4.\"\n\n\"There. Is he dead now?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then my rats keep biting him!\"\n\n\"Oh, god...\"\n\nApparently Sleazeball was not the sort of person to let an opponent die with dignity. Maybe he was just getting back at the knight for banishing his sexy Eidolon...\n\nAnyway, after that, Sleazeball rushed to the assistance of Fishnaut (while claiming, \"My brilliant plan worked perfectly!\") and got him on his feet, with one whole whopping hit point to show for it. Then, the mystery harpooner made himself known... a figure cloaked in green and wielding an entire BALLISTA on his back. He drew back his hood to reveal that he was a cyclops, incapable of speech. When Sleazeball demanded information out of the green-clad cyclops, what he got in answer consisted mostly of shrugs and pointed looks. Eventually the cyclops drew in on Fishnaut, looked over his injuries with a heal check, and concluded that Fishnaut was just a fucking sissy. With  a dismissive exhalation, the cyclops brushed past, grabbed one of the dead villagers, and took a bite out of the dead man's face while he walked out of the village. Sleazeball yelled something along the lines of \"WHAT THE FUCK\", and the cyclops cheerfully flipped Sleazeball the bird over his shoulder, then decided he didn't like the taste of the diseased corpse and left it by the side of the road.\n\nUnsure of what to do, the party (or more specifically, Sleazeball, who wasn't muttering things about his brain feeling funny, swimming scenery or how beautiful the little stars were) decided that they had little choice but to follow the cyclops out of the village. Fishnaut groggily mentioned that he knew where they were going- a small town with little to recommend it was in this general direction. Not sure of the cyclopses intentions, they followed as quickly as they could, and even tried to outpace the cyclops (on the reasoning that it might be heading to eat everything in the town). They failed at that, though, because whenever they tried to run, Fishnaut started coughing and both of them started to vomit. They KNEW that fucking village was a cesspit...\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"The joys of proper hygiene\", HELP FOR THE NEEDY AND THE FINER POINTS OF PILLAGING!](http://redd.it/2nqpkq)",

        "text": "Our normal Wednesday night session was canceled due to traveling and one member getting snowed in with little to no internet. I gathered together those that I could, and we decided to give [Silent Legions](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1637945166/silent-legions-a-sandbox-horror-rpg), Kevin Crawford’s newest project. The Kickstarter is still live, and if you like sandbox eldritch horror action, check it out!\n\nI had two players who played two PCs each:  \nAndrew D. as Giovanni Craft (Gambler Socialite) &amp; Julie Easter (Spouse Scholar)  \n\nAdam T. as Bridgett Warren (Musician Tough) &amp; Dean Pickens (Bum Investigator)  \n\nThe heroes are all members of the Maystead First Baptist help group, struggling with getting over some sort of addiction. Julie is the wife of Pastor Chris Easter, and runs the group. She gathered the three others to help her with trying to solve a mystery. About a week ago, her husband was working in the church office when an intruder came in and tried to drag him away. He escaped and the assailant fled, but outside was a [strange mark of graffiti](http://i.imgur.com/GJEyVJE.jpg). A similar incident happened three days later to Ellie Ashcraft, a member of the self-help group as well. Ellie is homeless and hangs around the overpass. She was accosted by four ‘rat men’ as she described it, who tried to drag her into an unmarked white van after they tore through her meager belongings. The police really haven’t bothered with either case, saying that it’s the word of a slightly deranged homeless woman and that the graffiti was probably just some punk kids.\n\nJulie begs to differ, and enlists the help of these unlikely heroes to get to the bottom of it. Dean suggests talking with Ellie, as he is also homeless and knows the area. They pile into Julie’s ‘mom van’ and drive over there. Dean starts talking to the crowds as Julie passes out cookies. Dean and the others learn that Ellie had some sort of hidey-hole near the old fertilizer factory, which exploded in a spectacular incident about three weeks ago. FEMA shut down the area and won’t let anyone in. They think that if she had anything worth stealing, it would be there. The group drives towards the factory, but are stopped at a roadblock. They double-back to the camp the FEMA officials set up for displaced persons. It is February, so things are pretty chilly, and the morale is low. Julie starts a prayer circle and Bridgett strums a few keys on her guitar to help out. They learn from a local named Tom that people sneak past the roadblock to get personal belongings from their houses, since they’re worried about looters. Tom shows them a path through the woods that brings them to the shell of the factory.\n\nThey poke around, and Dean finds a spot where he thinks Ellie might hide some things. Inside an old hollowed out tree-stump, he finds a strange piece of sheet metal. Its surface is smooth and seem to work like a tablet, but the words that are written down are in some language wholly unknown to the heroes. Julie takes out her notebook and scribbles down some of the words as well. They pocket the tablet and quickly take the return trip, barely missing a patrol of two police officers. They reach the FEMA camp and enjoy some hot coffee and donuts, and agree to meet at the Maystead Town Library tomorrow to look into the tablet.\n\nAfter a night of sleep they all meet in the parking lot, and head inside. Lillian the librarian welcomes them and asks if they need any help. Julie shows her the funny words and the weird tablet and says they need to translate it somehow. The librarian doesn’t know what language it is, but points them towards the section on languages. The group sits down and starts flipping through as many books as they can. After many hours, the closest they can get is some sort of early but extremely broken Mongolian. It may also be written in strange cyphers or code. They leave and the librarian gives them a strange look. Dean, the most perceptive of the bunch, notices her texting someone.\n\nDean remembers a ‘friend’ of his, Wiggins the Fence that loves conspiracy junk. He thinks that Wiggins might be able to crack some of those codes. They pile into the mom van and drive to the Maystead fairgrounds area, empty and abandoned since it’s mid-February. Wiggins is set up in his booth, wheeling and dealing with the bums and other types that call the Maystead underground home. They approach him with the offer to code it. He says he’ll do it for a price. Giovanni, ever the gambler, plays a heart-pounding game of war with him, on the condition that if the heroes win he’ll do it for a reduced price. He succeeds amazingly, and Wiggins says he’ll take a look at it. He just needs a watch or something of equal value to make up for the time lost.\n\nThe group leaves and decides how they’re going to get the money. They come up with an idea that Julie doesn’t like too much, but they go through with it. She drives them to Maystead First Baptist and meets her husband in his office. While she does that, the others break the lock on the financial office and sneak inside, finding the envelope from last Sunday’s offerings. They take $75 and return to the mom van. Julie returns and doesn’t ask any questions. They drive back to Wiggins and give him the money. He has figured out the title of the book, A Thesis on the Terrible Wisdom of the Feast-Maker. He doesn’t know what sort of crazy stuff they’re up too, but he takes the money and gives back the tablet.\n\nThey drive away from the fairgrounds, and Julie’s husband calls. He says that there’s a riot at the Crawkill House, and that Ellie is there and he’s worried for her safety after what happened. The group decides to go as well, to question her. The rioters are banging against the gates and shouting at Alistair Crawkill. He’s fourth generation old money in this town, and owns all the companies. An interesting fact about him is that his left arm is a prosthesis, he lost in in Vietnam. There’s a lot of blame on him for the fertilizer disaster that put so many on the streets. He assures the crowd that he too is deeply affected, as he lost a lot of money and workers in the explosion. He’s about to give a speech (behind the safety of his barred fence) when the heroes arrive.\n\nThey find Ellie and question her about the tablet. She says she found it once while walking in the woods. She saw some group sitting around a campfire and “singing or something”, but the cops showed up and broke up the gathering. They left the tablet behind and she took it because it looked valuable. She said she brought to Wiggins who figured out the title for her. Group is mad they got swindled.\n\nSuddenly, someone in the crowd pulled out a gun and opened fire on Alistair. Three shots were fired, and one hit. Dean saw Alistair go down and clutch the fence as blood started to seep around his shoulder. He pointed his left arm towards the gunman, who immediately fell over as if dead. Crowds were rushing everywhere and the cops were dispersing everyone that they could. Ellie asked for the tablet back and they told her they’d give it back tomorrow. An ambulance arrived for Alistair, and the paramedics were putting the gunman in a bodybag. Dean also noticed Lillian in the crowd, texting someone right before fleeing to her car and driving away. Everyone takes a small bit of Madness from witnessing that sudden display of violence.\n\nDean takes the time to mention how he’s seen Lillian the librarian everywhere, and on her phone. They decide to investigate what they might be about. They drive to the library but she’s not around, and Julie talks Martha, the other librarian, into giving her a phone number. Julie calls it and talks with Lillian, who immediately hangs up. They check the number and find out it’s an apartment complex across town, so they decide to visit her. On the way Giovanni stops at a rundown apartment he owns for ‘reasons’ and comes out with a guitar case. He says they’ll need what’s inside if things go really bad.\n\nThey drive to the apartment, and Bridgett and Dean find a way in to let the others inside the lobby. They march up to room 310, and can hear Lillian on the phone with someone. Giovanni puts down his guitar case and picks the lock, pushing it open. Bridgett is the first one inside, her revolver drawn for intimidation purposes. Lillian and a man are sitting at the dining room table. Lillian is on the phone. Both have guns. Panicked at the sight of them, Bridgett fires, but hits the microwave. Lillian looks up, rather shocked, and fires as well, striking the wall. Thinking it’s just her, her friend holds his gun up and yells at her to stop.\n\nGiovanni barges through the door, pushing Bridgett aside as he roars and sprays the room with bullets from the assault rifle that emerges from the guitar case. He strikes the cabinets, ceiling, and floor, but hits Lillian’s friend as he dives in front of her to takes the shot. He is nicked on the side and falls to the floor. Julie is in the hallway, covering her ears and shouting at everyone to calm down. Dean rushes in, a blur behind Giovanni, and grabs Lillian’s friend, dragging him up and placing his knife at his throat. Everyone has their guns trained on Lillian, who gives up and puts the pistol down. She also stops her call, tossing the phone at the ground so it smashes.\n\nThe group question her about what is going on, but she doesn’t answer much. She just tells them that they’re in over their heads, and a lot of ‘big-ticket’ people now know they have the tablet, since they were kind enough to wave it in front of her nose at the library. The tablet seems to be important for some sort of reason. Giovanni throws it on the floor and empties the rest of his clip into it, utterly destroying it. Lillian is not too happy, and states that they’ll all be killed for what they did.\n\nPeople in the hallway are starting to mutter, they heard the gunfire, so the group hurriedly picks up all the evidence they can find and leaves. When most of the group has left, Dean cuts the man’s throat, and Bridgett shoots Lillian. Both start their slippery slope into utter madness. The group flees the scene in the mom van as soon as the cops show up. Dean suggests talking to Wiggins, since he seems to have a bit more information on him then they let on. They drive to the fairgrounds and find him. They threaten him and he tells them that it wasn’t his fault, that he’s got a guy breathing down his neck trying to keep people away from this tablet business. He says that it was Alistair Crawkill, in disguise, that approached him and roughed him up. To make up for it, he gives them $80 back. Julie drives them back to the church so they can put the money back.\n\nThe next step is to question Alistair Crawkill. But he’s currently recovering from a gunshot wound at the hospital. Using her ties with the church, Julie talks the receptionist into directing her towards the room. The two cops guarding Alistair are members of the congregation, and allow her to enter for five minutes. Everyone else has to wait outside, but Dean slips away to the basement.\n\nJulie questions Alistair about the tablet, but he deflects most of it. She tells him they destroyed it and they saw him kill the gunman somehow. He starts to call for the nurse and tells Julie that they’re all as good as dead now. Meanwhile, Dean is in the basement, and he finds a duffel bag filled with Alistair’s personal effects when he was transported. Among them is his prosthetic. Closer examination shows that there’s strange patterns carved into it, almost invisible except by a keen eye. Dean snaps it over his leg, and takes all the money from Alistair’s wallet.\n\nThe group leaves the hospital, unsure what the threats of both Lillian and Alistair might mean for their future…\n\nWe had so much fun that I decided to draw it out into a second part which I will post when we go and play it. The group decided to takes some Deliria to help offset the Madness accrued during the session. Julie sees the horrors of poverty and vows to always help the impoverished no matter what. Giovanni starts to play with some of the dice in his pocket, realizing that his ‘lucky die’ is the reason he has survived so far. Dean realizes that nobody can be trusted, but he sees a ray of sunshine in Julie, and believes he can trust her with anything. Bridgett develops an acute fear of spiders, because she was staring at a spider on Lillian’s wall when she pulled the trigger, and associates the event with the arachnid.",

Information services and Kneebreakers. Also patronizes Alchemist, because he was training to be one once.\n* Lord Desantur: Noble. His family controls land in Roren, but is descended from a Vargan general installed to the duchy after Vargo's conquest of Roren. His family are considered, by and large, Cassapin Loyalists, as was Desnatur until Part 2 of this Write-up.\n* Karn Blackfox: Mercenary, under the vague employ of the party. Has about a dozen men following her. Has a Ballista stashed in Rroen City, requisitioned following a (failed) assassination attempt on another of our allies.\n\nThey meet up again with Kizmet, Desantur, Blackfox and the rest soon after, but their victory is hollow, for it is backlit with the fires rising from Roren City. Their night is not done.\n\n*\"Any ideas as to the cause?\" Their newest ally, Lord Desantur, asks them. \"I've been... Rather underinformed as of late.\" Their horses are already thundering back towards Roren, with all but the Thoroughbreds at a thunderous gallop. Lady Anomand, still wrapped in naught but Ianya's cloak, pinned against Svetlana by one of her arms: It's, in retrospect, a good choice: The Thoroughbreds can keep up with the other horses with a canter, and the smoother gait seems like it'd be better for her compared to a gallop. She's not capable of being asked at the moment though: She lives and breaths, but practically nothing else, and in any case it's just blind luck.*\n\n*\"I have just the one,\" Ianya replies \"Cassapin's spent the past few days getting offerings to Loica all over the city. Loica, lest you forget, the Low God of Contract and Oath and Slavery. He wants to puppet the population, using Loica to enforce the Oath of the Legion by force.\"*\n\n*\"And you think...\" Desantur trails off, and she hears the rare sound of a Roren noble spitting in disgust. \"Forgive me for my intransigence. All of you.\"*\n\n*They galloped on, the fires ever closer.*\n\nUpon reaching the outskirts of the city, the party makes for the Camp of Bezeal, the aforementioned (in previous parts) Gnomish Businessman/Mob Boss, one of the Party's longest running and most useful allies.\n\nWell, most of the party. Lady Anomand is transferred to the horse of Renyard, and both he and Suryan set off with all due (and some undue) haste towards the temple of Ninnisar, with orders to save Lady Anomand, and damn the sleep of Ninnisar's clergy.\n\nThe main party reach Bezeal's camp, which appears to have been turned into a makeshift hospital, Bezeal harried by all the organising he's been doing to keep some semblance of control going on.\n\nThe Situation in the city: Chaos, at first. Those afflicted by Loica's touch (already branded 'Oathbreakers' by the populace, due *perhaps* in some part to Bezeal) are mindless beings, their actions slow and jerky like poorly oiled hinges. But nevertheless, they've been deadly, reaping a deadly toll on anyone they they could get their hands on. Making no distinction between the young and old, children and toddlers.\n\nBut every adult here has served in the legion, and militas were quick to form. Progress has been made. Some areas are cordoned off, the Oathbreakers unable to break out, the populace unable to pacify them. Other areas are running battles. Many, blessedly, and free and clear by now.\n\nThe most worrying news, however, comes from the Red Hall, the only functioning Military installation in the city (it's walls long since expanded past and holed to the point of uselessness.) Roughly a third of all the Oathbreakers have converged on it, with ladders and grappling hooks, trying to break in and seize it.\n\nAnd they are capable of this level of planning and coordination because one of Cassapin's hullks is leading them.\n\nNow, I would like to take a moment to congratulate the GM on a Villain well introduced. The party, at this point, had seen the Hulks a few times, heard stories about them. All we knew was that they were taller than other men, clad in plate head to foot, not an inch of skin seen beneath Steel Inches thick, armour so thick no man could wear it. I can't recall if we had seen them fight, but that didn't matter.\n\nWe were afraid of the Hulks. Hulks were bad news, and everyone knew it. Guess it was time, then, to face our fears.\n\nBefore we went, Kizmet finally restocked his *Very* nearly empty bag of tricks. Potions of Sleep, Alchemist's fire, a pair of Tanglefoot bags, Caltrops.\n\n*\"Ah, don't worry about the cost son,\" Bezeal exclaims, clapping Kizmet around the shoulder. \"I won't be charging you for them.\" Kizmet begins to walk off with a grin.*\n\n*\"Today.\"*\n\nThe party hurries on, Allies Lordly and Mercenary in tow. The Blackfox sends off four of her men to go get the Ballista *Sharp like* as the rest of us Gallop on towards Red Hall.\n\nRiding up one of Roren's main boulevards, we begin to get a picture of the situation at Red Hall. Oathbreaker ladders have reached the walls, and scaling has just begun, with a large number of the Oathbreakers milling around at the base of the ladders.\n\nSuddenly, one of the Town guard leans a bit too far over the wall, and he's sliced in half. The Two handed Battle-Axe that the Hulk did it with it returns to his outstretched hand.\n\n*\"Karen!\" Svetlana's voice rings out over the battle and death. \"How's your shooting?\"*\n\n*Karen turns her head to face her, to see her digging at something lashed across her back. \"Crap, thanks.\"*\n\n*Svetlana smiles as she frees whatever it is from her back. \"Good. Hold this!\"*\n\n*She accepts the outthrusted object, turning it over in the dark, running her hands over it: Rolled Fabric over a wooden pole. A Banner then. She shrugs. Morale was a funny thing. She shook out over the side of her horse, letting it unfurl before raising it, taking a look at the design as she does so: Roren's Royal symbol, a Tree of Gold and three Red Apples.*\n\n*She's... Actually feeling a bit braver. Odd that. Then she noticed that it glowed slightly.*\n\n*Ah, she thought. Enchanted.*\n\n*Fair enough.*\n\n[The Banner provides a +2 Bless to all within Line of Sight of it who are fighting under it/for it's cause.]\n\nTurn 0 (Pre Combat)\n\nSvetlana Smites the thing. It's evil, oh god is it eveil. Ianya opens fire, and Kizmet scrambles towards the walls, outpacing those on the ladders even. Desantur's and Blackfox's men open fire on the crowd, beating them back, not fancying their luck against the Hulk's armour.\n\nGeneral plan: Be Mongols. Shoot at it, Kite it. 30ft exclusion zone around it.\n\nTurn 1:\n\nThe Hulk is forty feet away from them, and it throws it's axe straight at Svetlana. She dives from it's path *just about*, the Axe blade slicing through her right bicep, doing a crippling 26 points of damage (PSA: Almost half her health) One of Desantur's men suffer's a similar fate, another does not as the Axe bisects him.\n\nSvetlana hurriedly lays hands upon herself and returns fire, joining in with Ianya. They're hitting, by Ninnisar they're hitting it, but the armour is so thick half their shots do no damage at all.\n\nAn Excellent Climb check gets Kizmet to the top of the wall.\n\nThe Hulk is 40 feet away.\n\nTurn 2:\n\nKizmet dips into his bag of tricks for a sleeping potion, delaying the Oathbreakers form scaling the walls by... Well, putting them to sleep and then watching them fall off ladders. It's not a pretty sight.\n\nIanaya and Svetlana Fire and Fire again, hitting and Missing. They've killed a regular man thrice over by now.\n\nThe Hulk, his Battleaxe returned to him, takes a five foot step, then holds up his empty left hand, and Ethereal chains form from it, whipping towards the injured from his Axe throw. Desantur's man doesn't survive the experience, as the chains pulling on his wound proves too much as he screams his last. With dread, the party watch the poor man's soul dragged towards the Hulk, as it nourishes and heals itself on a man who will not reach any afterlife.\n\nSvetlana is more lucky, merely being wrenched forward ten feet and taking some more damage. But she can still fire.\n\nThe Hulk is 25 feet away from Svetlana.\n\nTurn 3: Kizmet chucks an Alchemist's fire at the Hulk, scoring a direct hit and piddly damage, but hey, every little helps right?\n\nIanaya fires and fires again, and Svetlana finds she can't move away, only dragged five feet closer by the chains as the Hulk steps again.\n\nThe Hulk is 15 foot away from Svetlana.\n\nTurn 4:\n\nKizmet, damning the Oathbreakers clawing ever closer to the top of the walls, scores a direct hit with the Tanglefoot bag on the Hulk... Paralyzing it twice over, the hardening goo released from the bag hardening, sealing a bond between the Hulk's legs and the floor, and more importantly into the joints of it's truly massive armour, as it shudders for a temporary halt.\n\nBy Turn 6, before it can break free from it's imprisonment, it dies. Armour scorched by fire, Arrows piercing every joint and eye hole twice over, the thing finally slumps back, the goo finally cracking under the weight that little could ever hold.\n\nThere is one thing this Party is *very* good at: Lots of Damage, very, very fast. And that Hulk learnt it to it's peril.\n\nWith it's demise, the Local Oathbreakers return to the realm of the living, with utterly no memory of what they've done.\n\nPerhaps that is a blessing. Perhaps not, given that their neighbors aren't afforded the same courtesy.\n\nOnly the Locals, note. There's still work to do; Their night is not over.\n\nBut the Session was. Until next time!\n\nThen the Ballista shows up, their grand rescue plan *ruined.*\n\n",

        "text": "[A tale of the campaign DM'ed by me!](http://redd.it/2n81db) For those of you who weren't here last time, this campaign is taking place in a strange setting of my own design, with a slew of custom races and house rules. As for the events of the previous session, they don't matter much- today we'll be focusing on the second half of what will hopefully be the party. Introductions are in order!\n\nOur first player is actually the DM for the campaigns I've told you about previously. He was excited to be able to actually play a character of his own, and after bouncing a few ideas around, he settled on [the concept of a sleazy summoner who had a very attractive female eidolon](http://fav.me/d3k1jaw) (this picture was his inspiration). Mister Sleazeball had been pressured by his magic-daddy into attending a school for wizards, but Sleazeball hadn't had any luck at all in doing anything other than summoning, *ahem*, companions. He had failed out of the wizard school, been cut off from daddy, and had couch surfed/begged/bummed his way around his home nation for quite a while. After he had tried to sweet talk/intimidate/blackmail/bribe a local hob-knob into getting free membership to some gentleman's club, he had been \"gifted\" a carriage to whisk him away (to a location where the driver was sure that mister Sleazeball would never be seen again).\n\nOur second player was relatively simple in comparison- a gillman sorcerer who had gazed into the void beyond the border of the sky, and peered into the heart of the emptiness beyond. The emptiness had gazed back, and one thing led to another, and they had a nice dinner and decided it would be splendid to see eachother again sometime. It was undeniable- Mister Fishnaut was in love. But reaching the emptiness of space wasn't something you could do in a tribe of rather dim-witted gillmen, and he set off down his home river in search of something, anything, that would get him up into the sky and reunite him with his beloved empty void.\n\nWith that, both of our characters found themselves in the same location completely by chance- a rather horrible marshy bog. Sleazeball had been fooling around with his eidolon for quite a while, and hadn't noticed the fact that his carriage had stopped moving until just now. He exited and took stock of his surroundings, marvelling at the fact that his driver had not only transported him probably hundreds of miles, but also somehow managed to steer a horsedrawn carriage onto a small island surrounded by murky rivers. I mean, that's dedication right there. Meanwhile, Fishnaut had wandered into the same bog simply because it was downriver of his home, and was meandering around, looking at the odd oversized mushrooms. He'd heard tales of people getting \"high\" after eating mushrooms, so he decided it was a good idea to take a bite out of one. (Spoiler alert: It was not a good idea.)\n\nAbout five seconds later, Fishnaut was being clawed at by an angry mushroom man who had just lost part of his head to an idiot trying to eat him. Fishnaut was only level 1, so the 2 damage he took from the mushroom man's puny claws was nearly a third of his health. Fishnaut wisely decided he should be elsewhere. Sleazeball and his Eidolon, meanwhile, had heard the commotion and decided to lend a hand to the idiot. Sleazeball fired his crossbow (barely missing Fishnaut) and commanded his eidolon to lend a shapely, rather pointed hand. One charge attack (and acrobatics check to keep from being sucked into the muck of the swamp) later, and the mushroom thing was dead, releasing a cloud of spores into the Eidolon's face.\n\nThe party, such as it was, grouped up at the marooned carriage to introduce themselves (which consisted of two very one-sided conversations about how space was awesome and this bog was terrible, respectively). While they bickered, I started glancing at their character sheets and making a lot of rolls...\n\nFishnaut checked inside the carriage for anything of use (he found this weird paper container of tiny sticks that had red globs on one end) while Sleazeball, uh, attended to his Eidolon. After a minute, they started asking a few pointed questions, like how in the hell were they going to get out of here, was that mushroom always on that side of the river, and why are there glowing red eyes looking at me out of my shadow? Sleazeball started to freak out when his shadow then started to reach up and off the ground, extending a black hand toward him- his Eidolon intervened with a claw to the shadow-thing's face. The shadow thing seemed to dissapate, but the Eidolon suffered a horrible chill that paralzyed her for a round and damaged every ability score. Lesson learned- to not touch the evil shadowy thing.\n\nThere was still trouble, though. Now, the shadowy thing was in HER shadow, and the mushroom was still getting closer. Thinking quickly, Fishnaut used a cantrip, Dancing Lights, to brighten up the immediate area. With an odd screech, the shadowy thing vanished... but, as the Fishnaut belatedly realized, there was a hell of a lot more than just one mushroom. There were things lurking in the water, and a lot of sinister croaking, too...\n\nWhat followed was akin to the world's slowest, most ineffectual zombie horde- none of these creatures had a move speed of over 10 feet, but between their sheer number, the limited spells of the party, the party's general terribleness with crossbows, and the frequent return of the godawful shadow-thing, the situation was pretty tense. At one point, a mushroom man almost reached Fishnaut, but Sleazeball had his Eidolon under the effect of Enlarge Person, and commanded her to give that cart a good push. Squish, no more mushroom man. Then they realized that this was their ticket out of here- they had the Eidolon keep pushing, veering the cart into one of the horrible bog-rivers so they could use it as a bridge. That done, they decided that they would like to leave this godawful place, and hop-skipped-plorped onto the other size, each of them losing a boot to the squishy, sucking ground. By the gods, that bog was terrible.\n\nFinally, the party exited and made their way onto some more pleasant grasslands, where... nothing of any interest whatsoever happened. I mean, grasslands are okay, I guess, but you know what's awesome? Civilization. And not having to exist solely on these freaking tasteless ration-bars. Well, hey, at least they remembered to pack them. Going back was out of the question, as they'd have to pass throught that goddamn bog again and there was nothing interesting in the gillmen village anyway, except perhaps being mind-raped by aboleths. The party wanted to go someplace with blackjack, and hookers, and maybe a space program or a really tall tree. You can get into space by climbing a tree, right? That decided, they looked around the horizon at a fat load of absolutely nothin' and decided the only thing to do was to venture into the nearby woods and see if there was anything interesting that way.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Fungal outbreak\", MUCK-RAKING AND HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT OUR LORD AND SAVIOR?](http://redd.it/2nl60x)",

        "text": "*See the first [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2nffmg/vtm_a_comedy_of_errors/) for a list of the PCs and general set-up.*\n\n***\n\nSo, Bill the Caitiff decided that he had to have that Tremere cane. \"It's probably magical,\" he told us with a lot of certainty. (It wasn't.) \n\nWhile the others are getting ready to leave the Tower, assured of its safety, Bill sneaks away from the group and attacks the Tremere. The Tremere fights back, but Bill's character not only got lucky with his rolls, but was also just a better optimized for combat. This was essentially combat-styled Caitiff vs peon Tremere neonate. \n\nIn a moment, the other PCs were rushing over. However, the Tremere was dead-dead. They took the cane away from the Caitiff. Arguably, they were going to give it to Des to return to the Tremere, but later they decided that since no one else came out and the Tremere neonate didn't raise an alarm, they'd best keep the Caitiff's transgression secret lest they all get blamed. Later on Des and Scott argued over who would keep the cane, but Des wound up the winner of that one. \n\nMadelyn immediately penned a note to be delivered to the Prince (she actually wrote it out in calligraphy and handed it to me, the ST, in a sealed envelope) that explained what the Caitiff had done, that she was worried about the trouble he was going to cause, and asked permission to kill him herself as soon as possible 'for the good of the city.'      \nThe Prince said 'no'. There were reasons given, but largely I didn't want to deal with the hassle as the ST of starting out a bunch of PvP fights. \n\n***\n\nIn the aftermath, the Caitiff fled into the night to settle into his own haven. Bill's player comes to me privately and says he thinks the others are plotting against him. He wants revenge but feels he's too weak to do it on his own. He wants to track down one of the NPCs he met at the earlier event.\n\nFine, I say. I'm thinking that he wants to perhaps start his own coterie separate from the others, or maybe to bring in more help. Sort of like how the outsiders have their own little coterie within the larger one. I give him a list of nothing but names of some of the NPCs. He wanted someone who was more social than a fighter. Great, I thought. He's trying to build bridges and shore up where his character is weakest. I let him make some rolls to track down two NPCs who fit his description. \n\nHe finds one of them during a subsequent night, tracks him down while the individual is on the Underground. I figure that he's going to get him alone and talk to him, try and work out some sort of deal where the Caitiff works as a bodyguard (it was what he'd done as a mortal).      \nNope. \n\nNo. Instead, he gets the guy alone, then attacks him and kills him, taking his wallet, phone, keys, etc. Doesn't Diablerize the guy. No, just kills and robs him. Dumps the body back in the Underground. Heads off to go use the guy's Haven as his own and drain as much as he can from the guy's Resources. \n\nOy vey. The downside to this that Bill didn't know (yet) was that the particular NPC he'd just killed was not only an Ally of Maddie's but was also the Prince's own Childe. \n\nWord got out within a few nights. Bill's character never spoke of it, the other PCs didn't know about the death (but they spent at least part of one game night looking for the missing Childe hoping to score points with the Prince by finding him).      \nThe PCs assumed this was evidence of the Sabbat cell that the Prince had warned everyone to be on the lookout for. Bill played along with this and somehow saw his unpunished commission of a crime as permission that he could do it again and again with impunity and shift the blame to the Sabbat. And so he began to plan additional assaults.",

In return the scribes tell him whilst the archivist is away he was previously researching the Wand of Orcus and they believe they know where it is, roughly. They show Fortinbras research that Agathion, the fourth layer of The Windswept Depths of Pandemonium was a likely prison for such an artifact, though they explained it is not such an easily place to locate, or break into, or out of. Rumour has it the locals know of ways though.  \n  \nThe rest of the party were going about their business, Norril and Baha performed a quick pilgrimage to a temple of Pelor that Baha visited previously when he went to Baator and assisted their order. Norril needed restoration of charisma damage that wouldn't heal on it's own. Restoration being a high level spell it's not available in E6 and thus he needed to go to some specialists. Baha wanted information and didn't mind visiting a temple of Pelor for it. They encountered a Couatl with a riddle, a long riddle that it relayed to them telepathically and promised directions for an answer.    \n&gt;By something formed, I nothing am,  \nYet everything that you can name.  \nIn no place have I ever been,  \nYet everywhere I may be seen.  \nIn all things false yet always true,  \nI'm still the same, but never new.  \nLifeless, Life's perfect form I wear.  \nCan show a nose, and eye, a tongue, or ear,  \nYet neither smell, nor see, nor taste, nor hear.  \nAll shapes and features I can boast,  \nNo flesh, no bones, no blood- No ghost.  \nAll colors, without paint put on,  \nAnd change like the chameleon.  \nSwiftly I come and enter there,  \nWhere not a chink lets in the air.  \nLike thought I'm in a moment gone,  \nNor can I ever be alone.  \nAll things on earth I imitate,  \nFaster than nature can create.  \nSometimes Imperial Robes I wear,  \nAnd in beggar's rags appear.  \nNever said I mourn, or glad rejoice,  \nI move my lips but want a voice.  \nI was never born, nor can I die,  \nThen prithee tell me, what am I?  \n  \n  \n  \nBaha answers \"A shadow\", Norril believes it is \"A cloud.\"  \n  \nCouatl reveals it's motives were just to watch them think (detect thoughts), and any answer would have sufficed as long as they thought about it.  \nIt also reveals the correct answer was [Spoiler](http://image0-rubylane.s3.amazonaws.com/shops/julietjonesvintage/RLES2728.1L.jpg) and leads them to the temple. At the temple Norril negotiates healing and Baha discusses theology but no real clues are discovered.  \n  \nWhilst they are away Kurask manages to get his charisma damage healed by a Golden Dragonborn with a really rare breath weapon of \"lesser restoration flames\" which it can use once a week. He then proceeds to ignore this quest hook and wanders off aimlessly, I guess it came across a little more subtle than I expected it to.\n  \nThe party locate a portal to Pandemonium's first layer, Pandesmos, in Sigil and once Norril and Baha are back they tell them the plan. Go to Pandemonium and ask around about Agathion. It's not much of a plan, but y'know, needs must. The party have ascertained that the portal key for this portal is \"a genuine scream of terror\". Roku decides that he's going to burrow into the ground and dive out at some unsuspecting civilian. He does so, the civilian screams and runs away, the portal opens.  \n  \nThe party then steps through, appearing in the middle of a group of red and blue Slaad who attack. The party fight and win, but it was a little close, leaving a few of the party worn and weary, they manage to discover... Well, a Circus. [The Cynosure](https://mgreis.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/cynosure_il_circo_errante_di_pandemonium_by_tony_diterlizzi-2631_1997-10_wotc_tsr_add_2ed_planescape_adventure_-_dead_gods.jpg) whom Norril had heard of, considering he worships Olidammara and the Cynosure are all about revelry. The Cynosure consist of a floating fortress that acts as the main theatre, and numerous large wagons for side-shows. Then numerous small wagons for the essentials like supplies and what-not. Then some small chariots for defending themselves against interlopers. People come from all around to see the show. The Cynosure travel through the tunnels of Pandesmos and because gravity is relative, they travel in rather odd formations. (see the picture).  \n  \n**Session 17**  \nThe party are approached by a chariot and they manage to act with some manners and diplomacy, they're able to board a wagon and move from wagon to wagon until they board the fortress. I describe them stepping through the wagons, going from a house of mirrors to a ballroom dance, to an inflatable obstacle course.  \nThey reach the fortress, buy some expensive tickets for the large VIP booth and immediately split the party. (sigh). Some ask around about Agathion, Some ask around for an item that allows them to teleport out of...anywhere in case they get stuck.  \nThe second group find a merchant selling a... Cubegate? I think it's called. Basically normally these items are very expensive, however this one has limited charges left, one charge actually. It's owner is hiding out in the Cynosure and doesn't want to leave but he needs coin to stay. The Cubegate has 6 destinations (one for each side) but they all teleport to the lower planes, save the last which teleports to the prime material. They want to buy it, but unfortunately they cannot afford it thanks to the party Rogue embezzling some funds from a personal objective which is really not making him popular.  \n  \nA cheaper option becomes available, a gem merchant says he has some rare gems of teleportation, created by a wild mage who went mad in the windswept depths, created in the third layer where wild magic zones run rampant. They'll teleport you, but you won't know where to until you get there. It could be any plane, any where, any time.... or you could teleport 5ft to the right of where you were. The gems are quite cheap for the powerful magic contained in them due to the wild nature and the party buys two for basically all their gold.  \n  \nThe other half of the party manage to locate a Bariaur priestess who has been to Agathion and just wants to go home. She says she was on a holy quest that she failed and her friends all died, she tells the party the secret to navigating Agathion if they promise to take her back to Sigil. She tells the party of the Ingress, that live on Phlegethon and they do not speak, they just need to tell the Ingress what they seek and the Ingress will get them there.  \n  \nThe party hire a guide to get to Phlegethon, an old man who doesn't trust men so he overcharges the female-less group for the rest of their gold. Gives them earplugs to protect against the maddening wind and leads them out of the circus and into the darkness, his staff lighting the way.  \n  \n  \n[Next](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2nnykx/saving_a_soul_from_hades_part_nine_dd_35e_e6/)",

        "text": "I started up a Vampire: the Masquerade game for a large group of friends. It was to be a big epic sort of sandbox, set in London. I directed the players to think about Camarilla characters as this was to be a big politically driven game centered on the city itself. Characters had to be a part of the establishment in someway. While that didn't *necessarily* mean only Camarilla clans (as you'll see), it *did* mean that I wanted the PCs to be \"loyal\" Camarilla subjects. \n\nThe game started off with all of the PCs being summoned to Elysium to hear an announcement from the Prince (as one does). This was going to be the chance to have all of the PCs meet one another as well as introduce a number of NPCs all at once. \n\nI got the NPC introductions done somewhat fast - while there were some singular individuals, most everyone was already a part of a Coterie. This was a subtle hint to the PCs that they'd need to form their own coterie for the benefit of themselves and their continued survival. \n\nFinally it was time for the PCs to reveal themselves to one another. Most everyone in the group knew what at least another player or two was going to make, but generally only the broad strokes - Concept &amp; Clan. \n\n***\n\nThe Ventrue PC (Madelyn) was first. Almost standard stereotype of a Ventrue. Wealthy, bored, minor political aspirations. It was the Player's first RPG ever, but later on she took to it like a fish to water. \n\nThen there was the Malkavian (Josh). Josh's Malkavian suffered from hallucinations. He'd been embraced after a particularly raucous night of clubbing and to his mind, was still tripping on drugs and alcohol. Over the course of the story his eventual descent was sudden, disastrous, and devastating. \n\nThen there were the three odd-balls. They worked, however. They really did. \n\nThere was the Ravnos (Will) who essentially worked as a black-market smuggler for the Camarilla, bringing in all manner of contraband into London. He had lots of mortal Contacts. He played out sort of like a business-minded Toreador. \n\nThere was the Samedi (Scott) who everyone thought was a Nosferatu. He eventually went on to be pretty powerful in the city but never lost his Nosferatu-ties. \n\nAnd there was the Kyasid (Des). She basically existed under the sufferance of the Tremere in town as she was something of an occult scholar. The player hated Tremere and this was a concession on her part that she went along with grudgingly. \n\nAnd then... there was the Caitiff (Bill).     \n\nNow, up to this point, there had obviously been some concessions made. The Ravnos was somewhat out there, but he'd tailored things so that he was a part of the Camarilla power structure. Same with the Samedi - he worked hard to keep the Masquerade working as an enforcer for the Sheriff (who was a Nosferatu). The Kiasyd was a bit of a stretch, as she was as much a breach of the Masquerade as the Samedi, not to mention being from a traditionally Sabbat bloodline. But, she agreed to remain with the Tremere, applying her knowledge and research skills for the good of the city. \n\nBut... the Caitiff. \n\nNow, being a Caitiff wasn't a deal-breaker (obviously). Yeah, he'd have a bit of a harder time with Camarilla politics, but it's not insurmountable.      \nBut then we got to his Flaws: Permanent Fangs, Sire's Resentment, Enemy, and Unconvinced. Basically, not only was he a Caitiff but his creator had publicly denounced him (and was working against him), while he himself had publicly stated that he didn't think the Masquerade was necessary AND his fangs were always visible for anyone to see. \n\nI looked over this train-wreck of flaws. While they all tied together into a back-story, sure, they also spelled out that this PC was going to have a horrendous time fitting in with 'polite' society. I told the Player so. He acknowledged that he realized that things were set against him, but he wanted to give it ago. I explained his list of flaws to the other players and explained why this was a bad idea. Most of them agreed, but also said that the Player should give it ago. After all, we already had the three strange outsiders. \n\n*Note: There were two other Players who would come and go, but they're not important here.*\n\n***\n\nEveryone introduced, the Prince suggested that those not in Coteries seek to join one. The Three outsiders decided they were working together. The Malkavian latched on to the Ventrue for some protection (he saw strange things in her aura that he liked). The Prince convinced the Ventrue to take on the Caitiff in order to show the Caitiff what it meant to be a servant of the city and the court. The outsiders were brought into the group because the Ravnos wanted a piece of the Ventrue's money connections (and the Samedi got nudged by the Nosferatu sheriff to go along with this so that he could keep an eye on the Caitiff). \n\nSo, we had the whole group together as a Coterie. *Huzzah!*\n\nThe Prince then took one person from each Coterie aside (the Ventrue in this case) and explained to them all that there were rumors of a Sabbat cell somewhere in the city. Everyone should be on watch and when not attending to personal needs, should establish a small Domain within the city in order to ensure that the Sabbat cell didn't have anywhere to hide.      \nA ridiculous position, to be sure, but there you have it. \n\nThe Prince let each of the Coterie leaders go back to their own groups to spread the word while he left with his own coterie of retainers to take care of things. \n\nThe Kiasyd realizes that aside from her and one other, none of the Tremere were at the meeting. When she learns of Sabbat in the city, she panics a little (she was on the run from the Sabbat). So, the PCs first head to the Tower of London where the Tremere had their Chantry hidden. \n\nWhen they get to the Tower, they're standing across the street watching when they spy a lone figure walking across the grounds. He's got a cane but doesn't walk with a limp. The Kiasyd realizes that its another Tremere and that he's probably patrolling the grounds. Maybe the Tremere already know about the Sabbat cell?\n\nThe Caitiff however decides \"Hey, I really like the look of that cane. He doesn't have a limp, so obviously he doesn't need it. Maybe I should just go attack him and take it!\" \n\n***And thus began our downfall.***",

        "text": "I know what under normal circumstances, I would not have been able to pull this off. But in this case, I had three things that worked for me. The first is that I rolled very high on my charisma, a 20, making me very good at talking to people and convincing them of my worldview. The second is that my DM loves intrigue and conspiracy, and so he was the perfect audience for these shenanigans. The third is that the rest of my party, who I couldn't adventure with for  few weeks due to a change in my schedule, were utterly and impossibly *boring.* And the DM wanted something interesting to happen.\n\nIn the crater of an ancient fallen star there rose up two ancient and proud kingdoms, who have warred throughout the ages. Now, they lay at an uneasy stalemate. Their forces continue to patrol the river that separates the two kingdoms, taunting the other side, but the general consensus is that the peace will last. It was in this valley of two kingdoms and in the shadow of this unsteady peace that Scathus the Crimson, a young, brooding bard, began his adventures.\n\nScathus never liked his party, to be sure. They were all bland, melodramatic, and predictable. Sienna Fox was a sorceress searching for true love, Groth was a giant orc, who may have been a trained dog with an axe. Sam was a paladin searching for redemption from some past crime that was most likely dreadfully boring and required several hours of monologue to complete. The only one Scathus found tolerable was Sierra Greenglade, a spunky flirtatious ranger. They had many adventurers in the valley, and were viewed favorably in the eyes of both kings. When a threat arose in a foreign land that would destroy the valley in a flood of darkness, they were sent to stop it. All except Scathus, who had an injury in a sword duel that prevented much travel.\n\nScathus was not happy. And as he sat brooding on the banks of the White River, watching the king's men throw insults back and forth, he came up with a plan.\n\nDonning a disguise, he set off to demand an audience of the king of the first kingdom, Grentil. And once he obtained this audience, he told a brilliant lie. \"My liege, your enemies in Orethica conspire against you. I have heard their king mutter of war once again. I am hopelessly loyal to you, as you know, and want you to be prepared should he take action against you.\"\n\nThe king trusts me, ever since I saved the royal crown from being stolen by bandits. \"What should I do?\" he asks.\n\n\"Forge weapons and train more men.\" I recommended. More pleasantries. He asks me to marry his daughter (again) and I refuse. I hasten off.\n\nDisguised again, I travel across the river and ask for an audience with the king. This one trusts me less, but when I say his enemies seem to be preparing for war, I'm telling the truth. He sends scouts to test my claims, finds them true, and prepares for war himself.\n\nAfter that, it was a simple matter. travel back and forth in disguise, sowing fear and mistrust. I forged a letter showing the generals of either kingdom have been in contact with each other as lovers and got them both imprisoned for treason. I stole the ring of Grentil's princess and planted it on a visiting Orethican dignitary.  Urged that dignitary to be executed. Then used his execution to fuel the fire of war.\n\nWhile I did this, I kept strong ties with the military might of both kingdoms. The recent imprisonment of both generals by both kings had made a rift between those loyal to the king and those loyal to their captains. I did my best to widen it. I would talk to drunk soldiers until they started a quarrel with their comrades. Before long, the militaries were split into those who trusted the monarchy and those who did not.\n\nIt took a long while, but I finally maneuvered everything into place. the two armies were facing each other on an open field, and both kings were in a paranoid rage, trusting only me. I recommended to both kings to send in their most loyal men, and both agreed. So the loyalists were in the thick of the fighting, and suffered the most casualities. It was now, with both armies weakened, and chaffing under the rule of their mad kings, that I revealed my ace of spades. The generals.\n\nI had gone to each castle and used my considerable skills to release them. I lied to them, told them I had counseled against their imprisonment, and urged them to end this mad war. They had waited with me by the edge of the battlefield, until their loyal soldiers were in the majority. And we rode out together.\n\nAs we rode out and they called for the men to put up arms, the two armies stopped fighting. I quickly told them in a very rousing public speech of how I had tried my best to prevent this war, and that the two kings were adamant in their hatred. It was very well done, with plenty of righteous indignation. At the end of the speech, the two kings were taken into captivity and the generals sat down to discuss a treaty for the peace.\n\nI don't know what I expected then, but it took a moment to register that both generals expected me to speak for both kingdoms. So I seized the moment. There would be no treaty, just a single kingdom under a single king.\n\nWhen my party returned home two weeks later, they were greeted by King Scathus the Crimson. It was the most fun I've ever had.\n",

        "text": "So I have been DMing a game recently for a few friends, before we started i figured they would form the same generic party i've DMed for, elves humans dwarves and the like, but when we fist sat down i was greeted by an orcish barbarian Steeeve who wants to smash everything and is the PR guy, a blood-soaked minotaur cleric who wants to drink every form of alcohol in the realm, and a shardmind battle mind who has a hard on for arguements. \n\nFlash forward to last night, the party now armed each with a special artifact begin their journey to stop a breach in the material plane and stop the shadowfell. Right when they make land fall another rift opens out pour several legion devils, after dealing with the minions they turn to the pit fiend who followed the legion devils who after finishing his magical creation of a fortress teleports the party to a dungeon. After several skill checks they make it to a massive door that leads them out.\n\nAs they approach the door it asks why it should allow them to leave. after several minutes of them trying to diplomatically talk their way through and the shard-mind being paralyzed, they finally talk their way out. Now the paralyzed shard-mind decides to taunt the door. the door attacks him one more time and rolls a natural 20. The player then rolls a 1 on his saving throw, and instantly dies. Therefore making a small skill check and word puzzle the most deadly thing in my campaign. Saddened by the death of his companion the orc barbarian takes the shardmind's head and hollows it out to make a helmet and the whole time I'm thinking what the hell has happened to my campaign.",

He's got a few hundred special ones, look more like thugs to me. Got their own little camp, own pickets and fires and mess, and their command structure isn't being changed. I watched some poor sod trying to ask one of their sentries some questions. All he got was 'Fuck off. Fuck off. I 'aint your friend, Fuck off.' And they're guarding something there. Something special they dragged in, two of Sod's,\" he jaunts a thumb over towards Cassapin's tent again, \"Hulks leading it.\"*\n\nHis Hulks are terrifying: Armoured head to foot, no skin shown, armour measuring in inches. None has seen their faces, no one can vouch for them being human. He has four of them.\n\n*\"So, look, err, Kizmet,\" the Lad says, cracking the knuckles of his free hand against his thumb, \"you here on business?\"*\n\n*\"...Yeah.\"*\n\n*\"Right, I'll see if I can get our people out then. Good luck, eh?\" And then they go their separate ways, never to likely meet again.*\n\nThe party is able to regroup, mostly without Svetlana noticing it's happening, and Kizmet spreads his information, and soon enough they find themselves on the outskirts of the separated encampment, an island of stability in the ocean of chaos. It's surrounded by a five foot picket of stakes ties together in inverted Vees. Enough to stop a Cavalry charge from the outside, but you won't be needing battering rams or siege towers to surmount it: The 'gate' such as it is, is simply a small wagon that can be moved in and out of the way.\n\n*Suryan cocks her head to the side and squints slightly, a small smile tugging at her lips in the darkness. \"I've been spending too long around you lot. Far, far too long. We need an escape route, don't we? For five of us.\"*\n\n*\"That's the plan,\" intones Kizmet.*\n\n*\"Well, he's got a a half-dozen Kavomiri thoroughbreds for his hulks and him...\"*\n\n*\"Do we have the time to make a detour..?\" Svetlana whispers. We're on a time limit as it is.\"*\n\n*\"I can get them,\" Suryan speaks, with as much force as one can muster whilst still whispering. \"Don't look surprised. I serve Elbereth, the Lord of Shadow and Secret. He'd be horrified if I* couldn't. *\"*\n\n*A pause. \"You've been spending too much time around us, haven't you?\" Kizmet replies.*\n\n*A grin. \"Oh yes.\" And then she steps out, into the shadows.*\n\nThey wait as long as they dare, and then, when the moon dips behind a cloud, Ianya takes to the skies to reconnoiter and soon finds a single a tent of non-standard design, with some seriously creeped out 'special troops' standing guard outside it. She glides down to perch atop it, eyes kept closed for them to avoid them shining, listening in.\n\n*It was cold. By Gallorin, it was* cold. *And the brute he'd been posted with wasn't helping. Thick and rock and about as dumb, and he talked* far *too much.*\n\n*\"You any idea what's in there?\" There went the Brute again.*\n\n*\"Seen inside. No idea. Don't want to have one. Don't ask and by Gallorin* shut up!*\" Trust his luck to loose at the dice today, off all days. Sep still hadn't paid him back, and if he'd had he'd have never bet the fucking cemetery shift. So, really, it was Sep's fault.*\n\n*He heard the fluttering of wings, but thought nothing of it, too involved in coming up with form of vengeance to unleash on Sep.*\n\nWhen you come with talons, getting into a tent isn't a matter of 'where's the door' but 'where do you want one?', and Ianya soon has her way inside. With her keen ears and proximity, all she can hear from within is a soft, male murmur. Whatever it is, it's not good.\n\nShe finally tears a hole in the fabric, and cocks her head to look inside.\n\nThe GM calls for a perception check, and Ianya gets 19. The GM describes what she sees.\n\nShe sees Lady Anomand, dressed in the ragged remains of a noble's gown, sitting in the fetal position on a pile of furs. She sees a brazier, hot coals red and white in the dark. She sees a golden statue, four feet high, the carved visages of two women, back to back, arms morphing into each other, mouths screaming in pain, purple incense trailing from their mouths in vines twirling towards Lady Anomand, and every time she exhales the same incense appears in her breath.\n\nIanya blinks and thinks. She takes a deep breath, then *dives* into the tent, polymorphing back into her usual form straight into a roll, her hands already reaching towards her waist. As she makes her feet, her hands find their mark and she dumps a sack over the statue, the vines collapsing into a sea of mist among the floor.\n\n*Ianya turns to look her in the eyes, but the \"Lady Anomand\" dies between her lips, as she finds herself staring into eyes of solid purple.*\n\n*\"My master, Lady Anomand's body intones, in a voice that is unmistakably both her and not hers, \"Thought it would be ironic. If I killed you. Or you killed me.\" And then she screams, first in pain as muscles bulge and claws tear through her fingernails, the remains of her dress tearing torn to rags, and then in rage as she lunges for Ianya, but she's already gone, a single feather left behind in her haste.*\n\n*Outside, the Brute can barely squeak out a \"What wa-\" before he knows, as the abomination rends through one of the tent walls, screaming upwards at the sky until it collapses to its knees back in Lady Anomand, and is hurriedly shepherded back into the tent like a wayward child.*\n\n*Someone turns up with some thick twine and some more canvas and hurriedly begins patching, eyes fixated on her work, hands shaking. To be honest, his were as well. He had to get the damn thing back inside. He looked around and sighed, yanked the sack off, and stalked out again.*\n\n*Turns out the brute wasn't a* complete *idiot. Took one look at the sack and asked if they should send someone off to tell him. Asking if he was volunteering shut him up though.*\n\n*He glanced up at the sky. Four more hours, or thereabouts. He huddled further into his cloak. A long, long shift awaited him.*\n\nIanya flutters away to inform Kizmet and Svetlana what had just happened, but she saw that she hadn't needed to bother. A Paladin of Ninnisar cannot retreat from an Abomination, and so she stalks grimly forward, Kizmet guiding her path, and the two find themselves against the outside of the tent,facing a fresh patch as Ianya flutters up to Andarta to describe to the Wyrmling what the hell is going on. Kizmet cuts a fresh hole in the fresh canvas, and the GM calls for perception checks.\n\nThey both get above twenty. Ianya heard the murmurs. These two *understand* it.\n\n*You Love him. You Obey him. You are his Slave, his Chattel. You belong to him, to Cassapin. You Love him. You Obey him. You are his Slave, his Chattel. You Belong to him, to Cassapin. You Love him...*\n\nThe GM calls for Willpower checks, and they fail with flying colours, Svetlana, with all her Paladin bonuses, rolling a natural 1.\n\nTo Ianya above, she sees them creep to the tent, cut a hole in it, peer in, and halt, freeze still.\n\nIf a Raven could sigh, it would, but fortunately she's finished her explanation.\n\n*\"Andarta. That Statue I told you about?\" She squawks at the Wrymling. \"Get down, knock it over, get back up here. Don't listen, be silent. Go!\" It is fortunate that the bond between them runs deep, far deeper than mundanely possible.*\n\nAndarta does so with barely silenced glee, snapping one of the tent poles in the process, fortunately freeing Svetlana and Kizmet from it's thrall, but until it's properly undone they suffer a -1 to all Willpower checks.\n\n*\"Fucking hell!\" Screamed the Brute, \"What the hell was that?\"*\n\n*\"Don't know.\"* Don't care. *Four Hours, then off. Probably to a fucking full day's march. Fuck.*\n\n*The Brute cranked his head around. \"I think it's smashed one of the poles or something-\" he voice slurred around the last word. Probably taking a drink. Couldn't blame him.\n\n*\"Hey, I'm gonna to guard that cracked pole, okay?\" His voice sounded a little different. Lightweight.*\n\n*\"Sure. Go ahead.\" Drink yourself silly, see if I care. He reached into his own cloak. And now he's gone, he could get started with his own liquid warmth. Hey, maybe this shift wouldn't be* too *terrible after all.\"*\n\n*In the darkness, Kizmet hurriedly dragged the corpse around the corner, into the darkness, dragging his sword out from the poor bastard's eye socket. Well, it worked didn't it?*\n\nAnd that, /r/gametales, is where a good bluff check can get you in life.\n\nKizmet and Svetlana try again, this time cutting low, and wriggling under into the tent, to spy hot coal scattered across the floor, not yet setting the floor alight, the statue undented and unscorched, lying there on the floor. They hurriedly shimmy inside, to again be met with solid purple eyes.\n\nThe Abomination screams  into life again, and Svetlana feels Ninnisar's call: No retreat, no surrender. It must be undone or destroyed, and Deities broke no compromises. But from Inaya's description, she knows that it is not permanent: There is yet hope.\n\nIt is at this point that the party hear the whisper in there minds\n\n*Beyond the Pickets, in the eves, within the shadows.*\n\nHigh above, Ianya spots the the absence, shadows so thick they take their own form, a constrained cloud of black and silence.\n\nKizmet makes a play for the Statue, rolling it into his bag of holding, not daring to seal it, before stealthily bolting (a feat only possible that to his ludicrous stealth rolls and skills) outside the tent, evading the converging circle of terrified, confused onlookers, Ianya swooping down to guide him.\n\nReaching the shadows, he overturns the bag at Suryan's feet.\n\n*\"This thing. Do Priest Things. Stop it!\"* and then's he's off again, back towards the abomination.\n\nFor Svetlana, Ninnisar leaves no choice. And she raises her bow to do battle. Fortunately for the health of Lady Anomand, she's a tough target to hit, a tough target to wound, especially when your opponent is too busy dodging most of the time to strike back. But neither can dodge forever, and both take wounds.\n\nSvetlana must fight. She cannot fight. With her Eyes of Doom she *Dooms* it, with arrows she wounds it, until she wounds it enough that it Rages and knows nothing but Hate and Tear. Even then it goes strong, until she hits it with a brace of three arrows and it trails into black smoke before her eyes, Purple, staring eyes the last thing that remains before dissipating.\n\nSvetlana's perception check is only enough to tell her it's still here.\n\nIt is to this that Kizmet returns, Svetlana angling at shadows and their foe nowhere to be seen, but Kizmet does better, and sees the Purple Eyes forming up behind Svetlana as he points in alarm.\n\n*Oh Elbereth, the Shadow, the Night, the Secret, I beg of you to aid me, and strangle this evil until it this but an unheard whisper, hidden from all the world and all life. Take this evil unto your breast, so that it may become one of your secrets, never to be told...*\n\nSvetlana spins on the spot then dodges as the Abomination screams, lunges- And Lady Anomand collapses forwards, bare for all the world to see. Svetlana's *Eyes of Doom* tells her that she's alive: But she breaths and nothing else.\n\nBeyond the Pickets, in the eves, within the shadows, the Statue appears to all the world to be nothing but a solid silhouette , and even then it hurts to touch for Ianya and Suryan as they maneuvre it onto one of the Thoroughbreds: Suryan was even able to saddle and bridle them.\n\nSvetlana slings Lady Anomand  over her shoulders, as Kizmet holds up a hand to wait, and then he barrels out of the front of the tent, a Green Haired ball of Thunderstones, taunts, insults and dodges, as he begins to play the Pied Piper of the Legion Camp. he slips out some time later into a Page in the main camp.\n\nThose not turned aside by Kizmet soon find themselves dead, as Ianya covers the escape of Svetlana well enough that only a single arrow ever finds itself going Svetlana's way. It misses.\n\nThe they're on the Thoroughbreds, and, after pausing for a moment for Ianya to wrap her cloak of feathers around Lady Anomand, they set off at a Gallop.\n\nThey're on Thoroughbreds, in a camp that was already barely organised chaos *before* they showed up.\n\nThey're nothing that can stop them.\n\n---\n\nThey meet up again with Kizmet, Desantur, Blackfox and the rest soon after, but their victory is hollow, for it is backlit with the fires rising from Roren City. Their night is not done.",

        "text": "Hello there /r/gametales ! It's been a while since we had any Fateless tales hasn't it? Not my fault, I prmoise: One of the (other) players couldn't attend for a month so we took a break, and then *another* player couldn't attend the first session post-break. But we're back! (For now...) :-(\n\n[Last Session, in which Ianya gets shot by Crossbowmen](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ihm2w/pathfinder_the_fateless_campaign_why_pathfinder/)\n\n---\n\nThe Party right now\n\n* Ianya, a half-elf, Level 7 Ranger (Beastmaster), Feyblooded, can Polymorph into a Raven 3 times her day.\n* Her Animal Companion Andarta, a Bronze Dragon Wyrmling\n* Svetlana, a human, 4/3 Fighter (Archer) / Paladin of Ninnisar, claimant to the Throne of Roren, which we have spent most of the Campaign thus far resurrecting.\n* Her Cohort Renyard, a priest of Ninnisar, and very handy with a Battleaxe\n* Kizmet, a Gnome, Level 7 Rogue (Acrobat)\n* Kizmet, although he has Leadership, has No Cohort as of yet.\n* Suryrian, an elf, Level 7 Cleric of Elbereth, NPC, who's name I have been spelling wrong the entire time, and is very much under appreciated.\n\n---\n\n**Previous Session Recap: We re-created a Kingdom, because the main Villain, Prince Cassapin, wanted the chance to destroy us on the Battlefield. Ianya attempted to win a Loyalist of Cassapin's, Lord Disantaur to our cause by proving he was dishonorable, by stealing his things and presenting them to him the stolen things. Ianya failed, was captured and subsequently rescued by Kizmet through the use of many Caltrops and confused Ponies.\n\nWe begin our session with Kizmet and Ianya staggering back to our lodgings late at night, pausing only to poke Suryian long enough to heal us before collapsing into bed.\n\nMorning comes, and, of course, Cassapin is up to something. Small groups of his men are going out in the city on specific, unknown and therefore nefarious purposes. Some of them are simply going out to acquire wagons and carts and pack horses, that sort of thing. Vargan Logistics are excellent, which means he's doing that to spite us, but we allow him that one. We've spent several sessions spiting him after all. It's the other groups we're worried about, the ones going off the specific places, incanting some form of prayer or ritual, then returning to Red Hall.\n\nKizmet, therefore, follows the next group he can find. He tails them to the house of an old Vargan loyalist, who seems a little scared of what the four Legionaries who have turned up to his house are about to do, but he allows it to happen. Kizmet easily slips past the old Loyalist with his ludicrous stealth skill, and gets into a prime position to listen in, and here is what they chanted:\n\n*Oh Loica, praise her.* *Oh Loica, Praise him* *Oh Loica, Praise her.*\n\n*For I have sworn the Oath of the Legion, and I hold this Oath as truth.*\n\n*May you hold all it's other Swearers to this Truth, as True as I do*\n\n*The Oath of the Legion, Oh Loica, praise her.*\n\nThe Legionaries then open their palms and sketched a symbol on the ground in their blood. It's worth bearing in mind, at this point, that Vargo practices Universal Conscription: Men serve 3 years, women 2, but they've all served in the Legions of Vargo and have thus sworn it's Oath to the Emperor and his family... Including Prince Cassapin.\n\nKizmet lacks the knowledge (religion) to know what the hell a Loica is, but Svetlana and Suryian don't and when he asks them they tell.\n\nIn the beginning there was the Pantheon of Gods, and they were in Harmony over all creation. Over time, however they argued and bickered and fought, and what had been their harmony began to fracture as flaws appeared, flaws of indulgence and pride and hate, and over time these flaws manifested themselves as a new pantheon of Gods. They are not fallen, for they would have had to rise first. The Low Gods\n\nLoica is one such Low Goddess. Patron of Oath, contract, slavery, hypnotism, the Gullible, the bully and the jailer. Accursed enemy of the God of Fate, if there is a means by which one has their will or agency over their own fate taken from them, Loica is there patronize it. Given that we, the player characters, are 'Fateless', the very antithesis of Loica, in that we have *absolute* control over our fates, that the Gods themselves cannot name our time and places of passing, we do not like Loica very much.\n\nEspecially as Ianya believes that Cassapin is doing this in order to puppet the City's population to fight us.\n\nHurriedly, he rush off to various places to inform our our friends and allies among the first, second and third estates: The Clergy of Ninnisar, Cal Thurr, newly elected Hetman of Roren, and Bezeal, our close friend and honest businessman (also Gnomish Godfather with a sideline in charitable works.)\n\nA response is hurriedly formulated, obvious and not so obvious tails established on any new parties that come out, a low-key scouring of the city takes place, with the Clergy exorcising whatever symbols they find. The remarkably organised and well-spelled anti-Cassapin graffiti spread around the city is updated remarkably quickly to brand him 'Cassapin the Demon-Friend.' Kizmet denies all knowledge, even when not asked about it.\n\nCassapin responds by flooding the city with these parties. The ones followed back off tasks undone, but there are simply too many of them, and a few slip through the net.\n\nAt noon the next day, Cassapin's Legion leaves Roren (the city), yelled and jeered at all the way, pelted with rotten fruit and eggs by the commoners, the Nobles absent, by order. At the edge of the city, Cassapin turns and delivers a small speech, naming us all Oathbreakers and traitors, promising us our comeuppance.\n\nSvetlana hits him straight in the head with a tomato, and Vargo's legion leaves Roren, an Exultation to Ninnisar ringing in it's ears.\n\nAnd now, to business. The Red Hall, the former Royal Seat of Roren, has been stripped of everything military useful, but has been left otherwise unlooted. But there is a note daggered to the door to his office (the office subject to Ianya's raid last session.)\n\n*Only the Wolves of Roren may enter.*\n\nHe means us. Kizmet scales the outside of the tower and enters through the window, to find an office, unkempt but unlooted, with a trapped chest and a letter atop of it, the door runed to only open when one of us approaches, but otherwise untrapped.\n\nThe first letter is little more than a statement of intent: To conquer and burn the world. And kill us, but we knew about that bit.\n\nKizmet disarms the chest (by triggering the trap once, dodging it, then disarming it on the second try, 'just as planned.'\n\nInside there is another letter, and a small box, a box that Inaya knows all too well: For the want of it she was shot down two days ago.\n\nWith the second letter, Cassapin talks about Fate. he talks about he saw his sister killing him in a duel to the death, how he believes that Dural Suratal freed him from this (although I, personally, am not so sure that he is truly free, either from that Fate, or Fate in general.)\n\nHe ends the letter thus...\n\n*\"Since I have taken something I so dearly wanted, I have behind something which you so dearly wanted.\"*\n\nHe's talking about the box. Kizmet, having checked it for traps, opens it to reveal a single lock of Blonde hair.\n\nAvid readers of this series (should I have bothered to add in the detail) will know that the Duke of Roren (the City,) Wisteril Anomand, has a very beautiful wife, with whom Prince Cassapin has been *obsessed* with. Avoiding him was the entire reason she moved all this way out East to marry the Duke of Roren (the city) in the first place.\n\nLady Anomand is known for her beautiful, rare, blonde hair.\n\nWe start silently panicking, and we quickly make up excuses for leaving then scoot to the Anomand household... And we come across a slaughterhouse, all who we could find within dead. a Locked and barred door reveals no one cowering behind it, only the Treasury, left unmolested.\n\n*Ianya began to pace. \"Alright. We've got to get her back. No question. First, we determine if Wisteril knows. If he doesn't, great. Don't tell him. Then, we wave this thing in Desantur's [The Loyalist Duke mentioned at length in previous episodes] face and finally bring him on side. Then, we tell Thurr what the damn hells we're doing and get Lady Anomand back.\" In the eyes of the party, there is no other course of action to take, and there is no dissent or questioning, only nods.\"*\n\n*\"And put that back!\" She half jokes, half snaps at Kizmet.*\n\n*\"Put what back?\" Kizmet innocently asks, clanking a lot more than he used to.*\n\nWe bolted back upstairs, treasury untouched and relocked, *Kizmet.*\n\nWe go off to find out what's becoming of Wisteril. He's having the time of his life, as it turns out. Last session, we gave him Moonsilver, a substance that radically quickens and heightens enchantment. It is usually collected via time-intensive rituals, carried out at the height of the full moon, yielding a few precious drops. You can buy the eternal awe and wonder of a Sultan with a small Vial of it.\n\nWe gave him a small barrel.\n\nHe's been busy, albeit not entirely focused. He's taken up in one of the City's premier universities (which has been cleared out for him.) He  hasn't eaten or slept much, and he's somehow managed to get a sword stuck in the air. They had to move the table he was working from because he kept on knocking into it.\n\nWhilst we're there, we attempt to steer him towards slightly more practical schemes (he admits that he sometimes forgets *why* he's working,) ascertain that he believes that his previous 'Turn the Statues into soldiers' idea isn't practical with the time available, and that he believes that his wife is still at their estate. Good, good. We make our excuses and leave, although not before trying to convince him to move to Red Hall for *his own damn safety.*\n\nKizmet and Svetlana make their way to the the Estate where Desantur is staying. For Kizmet, it is the third time. It's Vargan banners still fly, gates barred and locked, an obvious watch kept, both from it and on it.\n\nKizmet and Svetlana are permitted, As always, Desantur keeps his word. He said, that if we could prove that Cassapin to be dishnourable, then he would join our cause. Well, we do, and he does more than that, essentially throwing himself upon the literal mercy of Kizmet, offering up even his life itself.\n\nAs tempting as it may have felt for Kizmet, Desantur is both useful and not that bad of a person, really. All they ask of him is to join the rebellion, with or without his family's patriarch, and to aid us tonight in our rescue attempt, by holding mounted troops just outside the camp to help aid the escape, to which he readily agrees.\n\nWhilst that's happening, Ianya is currently informing Cal Thurr what's going on. He doesn't even consider it that important until he learns that we gave Wisteril Moonsilver, and which point he hurriedly grabs a scholar to explain to him it's full effects. They are both struck dumb when they realise how *much* he has (Eg: Enough to buy a decent chunk of the *world* if we used carefully) and rapidly approve the raid, as long as Wisteril *doesn't know.* (He's *very* relieved when he finds out that we didn't tell him.)\n\nAnd so, in the dead of night our party sets out, to wit:\n\n* Lord Desantur and his retainers\n* Karen Blackfox and her Mercenary warband, whom the party picked out during one my long haitus. Svetlana's cohort Renyard is staying with them, because he's \"As Stealthy as a Brick.\"\n\nAltogether, two dozen Men, all mounted.\n\nAnd then the party, Andarta circling above.\n\nThe Mounted Component get as close as they dare, and the party continues on, Ianya slipping into Raven form, to sneak into the Legion Camp.\n\n* Suryian, serves Elbereth, the Lord of Shadow and Secret, the Whisper, the Ambush. She has no trouble\n\n* Kizmet is small, dexterous, and has Crazy good stealth skills, and good disguise rolls, and is able to disguise himself as a Page, and happily strolls through the camp.\n\n*Ianya is dexterous, has a good Stealth Skill, and, you know, a Black Feathered Raven *at night* and is fine, but has to cover for\n\n* Svetlana, who is not very stealthy.\n\nIanya gets a grand total of 33 on her stealth roll, modified to 28 for having to direct Svetlana as well, Suryian shadowing them all the way. They are able to pass through the Camp undetected, although Svetlana's Ears are a little worse off, given the... Limited communication abilities available to a Raven.\n\nKizmet, with his increased freedom of movement, is able to notice a little more of the various grumblings going on around the Camp. The Legion that left the city has met up with two other Legions, and are busily being integrated into a single command structure, a process which is... Not going perfectly. Barely organised chaos, really.\n\n*\"Put up the tent, take down the tent, put up the tent,\" The Legionaire grumbles, warming his hands around a weak fire, scuffing his boot on a rock, \"Take down the tent, put up the tent, move the tent five metres to the left, move it ten metres to the right, move it five metres to the left... This is your new Commanding Officer! No wait, this is! Actually, you've still got your old one... Except you haven't! Bloody fucking hell...\"*\n\nHe also spies a few gnomes scurrying about. Smelling Bezeal, he yoinks one around a quiet corner.\n\n*It wasn't too difficult gaining the Lad's trust. His name, a description of Bezeal, the fact he was a Gnome. Even so, the lad kept a hand over his hammer. Smart.*\n\n*\"How'd you even get* anyone *in here?\" Kizmet whispered, practically shaking the lad around the shoulders. \"He's a maniac, not stupid. Bezeal's been rock deep with Roren the whole time. Cassapin must know* something *by now!\"*\n\n*The lad gave a light chuckle, stifling it quickly. \"Bezeal's been selling the sod,\" the lad drags a thumb over his shoulder, directing it towards the Cassapin's tent, at the summit of a low hill, dark and brooding, the hill kept clear to the base, \"faulty info ever since he arrived. Been making a* fortune, *Bezeal has.\"*\n\n*Kizmet nodded. Sounded like Bezeal. \"Listen. Anywhere special in the camp? Special Guards, closed off, Hush-Hush and the like?\" The Lad nods.*\n\n*\"Yeah. He's got a few hundred special ones, look more like thugs to me. Got their own little camp, own pickets and fires and mess, and* their *command structure isn't being changed. I watched some poor sod trying to ask one of their sentries some questions. All he got was 'Fuck off. Fuck off. I 'aint your friend, Fuck off.' And they're guarding* something *there. Something special they dragged in, two of Sod's,\" he jaunts a thumb over towards Cassapin's tent again, \"Hulks leading it.\"*\n\nHis Hulks are terrifying: Armoured head to foot, no skin shown, armour measuring in inches. None has seen their faces, no one can vouch for them being human. He has four of them.\n\nChar. Limit.\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2n81db/pathfinder_mister_numbers_and_the_weirdass_world/",
        "text": "Welcome, friends. I am mister numbers, and tonight I have a tale for you. A tale of violence, the beginnings of journies, and unlikely friendships. Tonight, I am the DM\n\nI decided that while playing games with my friends was all well and good, there might be something to say about hosting a game of my own. I've been a fairly active writer for a while, and I had my own fantasy setting that was perfect for the task: the world of Vigas. At heart, it was a high fantasy much like any other, but there are quite a few odd quirks. We can start with the simple: there is no healing magic or dark magic, because good and evil are just concepts. Injuries take time to put right. There is no raising the dead.\n\nAnd there are also compelling creatures, each with a different attitude and disposition. I created race sheet after race sheet, because in this particular part of Vigas, the humans aren't dominant. Our adventuring party would be composed of outcasts and misfits, of inhuman races with extraordinary abilities.\n\nMy first player decided to roll up a Dullahan. Dullahans are ghosts bound to empty suits of armor, more than a little bit remniscient of Full Metal Alchemist. The ghosts inhabiting the armor do not remember their former lives, and have no attachments to anyone. This Dullahan is a ranger named Virkri, and I foolishly let her start the game in fullplate armor, weilding a shield and spear.\n\nHer first session, she was sent out by some whiny aristocrat to find her stray cat. While wandering aimlessly down a road, she checked the bushes and found a goblin lying in wait. Seizing the opportunity, she charged forward and smashed its head against a rock with her shield. His friends, also hiding in the bushes, took exception to this.\n\nWhat followed was a slaughter. Virkri had such incredbile armor that the blows bounced off her, and she didn't take a single point of damage. After a brief scuffle that resulted in one hobgoblin brained with his own crossbow and the other writing in pain and vomit as he clutched his bleeding groin, Virkri stumbed upon a discarded collar and concluded that the goblins had eaten the noblewoman's cat.\n\nWhen presented with the collar, the noblewoman made the very compelling argument that the collar was of the wrong size, and was for a dog named \"ruffles\". The noblewoman swore at Virkri and called her incompetent, and sent her away to fetch her cat properly.\n\nMaking use of her ranger talents this time, Virkri tracked some fluffy white fur into a nearby dilapidated hut. She quickly found the cat, but there was a problem- while she was distracted, a giant chameleon decided she looked like a good meal.\n\nThis went about as well for it as it had for the goblins. After shattering all of its teeth on Virkri's metal exterior, it decided to change tactics and grab her with its sticky tongue. This also went poorly, as Virkri simply held her spear out, grabbed the tongue, and gave a stubborn tug.\n\nThat done, she went back to chasing the cat (who was having none of this) and followed it into the bushes, where she and the cat were both surprised at the appearance of a cyclops who had been watching from the undergrowth.\n\nCyclopses are a unique race in my campaign- they have one eye, which takes up all of their face, and also functions as a mouth. Cyclopses are also notoriously strong, but it was a bit surprising to note that this particular specimen was armed with a mace with a head at least as large as he was, and a crossbow so big that it was quite obviously a repurposed ballista.\n\nThe cyclops grabbed the cat easily, and watched with amusement as Virkri fumbled over her words and clumsily asked for it back. The cyclops obliged, and tossed it directly onto her helmet.\n\nThe cat was alright with this. Virkri considered this a success and headed back to town, head held high (and warm). She recieved a small reward from the distressed noblewoman, and a halfhearted apology for her earlier behavior. With nothing else to do, Virkri left the town in search of more work, and more money.\n\nMeanwhile, in a small orc village, a family was saying goodbye to their daughter. The parents were both orcs, but the 12-year-old daughter was a Cyclops. Until now, this Cyclops (named Pratena) had acted as the guardian of the village, luring invaders into a false sense of security and then eating them. However, her Cycloptic appetite was now running the town out of food quicker than it could be grown, and they sent Pratena off to make her own way in the world. While this goodbye was happening, a band of centaurs was passing through the village, making a quick check with the local blacksmith before continuing on their way. Pratena decided this was as good a way to go as any and followed them out of the village.\n\nIn a large grassy field, two people found themselves with nowhere to go and nothing to do- a Virkri and Pratena. Virkri was simply looking for more work, but Pratena was looking for a meal. Both had made a potentially fatal error- they had wandered onto centaur territory alone. While the Dullahan and the Cyclops wandered toward eachother, the trio of centaurs from earlier saw them and charged in, weapons ready.\n\nThe first centaur took a passing swing at Virkri with a longsword, which bounced off her shield. The second capitalized on the distraction and scored a lucky hit on the Virkri's armor, and bisected it through the torso. Luckily, the seal keeping Virkri bound to her form was not harmed, and she was simply dismantled. The third centaur advanced on the small girl in the pretty little dress, readying a net...\n\nAt which point he was taken by complete surprise when Pratena lunged at him and devoured a good portion of his face. [See, Cyclops eyes split open down the middle, revealing a gaping maw filled with pointed teeth made to chew through bone.](http://i.imgur.com/Nqv7YmV.png) That particular centaur was toppled to the ground by the force of the lunge, and the agonizing pain.\n\nHis friends decided to rush in and help, with one prising the blood-soaked child from his ailing comrade and the other attempting to staunch the bleeding. Pratena struck at the centaur holding her, but he simply dodged the blow and gave her a stiff smack across the face. As his comrade would probably have told him, this was unwise. The now one-handed centuar dropped the monster child and backed away, furiously scrabbling in his pack for bandages. While he was busy, Pratena swallowed the torn-off hand and leapt, snapping through the centaur's skull with a vicious bite.\n\nMeanwhile, Virkri the Dullahan was painstakingly trying to piece her lower self back onto her upper self- a difficult task. She eventually managed to extract her crossbow from inside her bag, and fired it at the centaur that had bisected her (he was currently attending to the first centaur that had lost most of his face). Interrupted, the centaur took stock of the situation- one friend down, one dead, two enemies, one of which has a taste for faces...\n\n&gt;NOPE. NOPENOPENOPENOPENOPENOPE^NOPENOPENOPE^NOPENOPENOPE^NOPENOPENOPE\n\nPratena the cyclops dug into her fresh kill and began eating an absurd amount. Virkri the Dullahan, meanwhile, was shakily back on her feet and using some scrap metal to keep herself from falling apart again. Despite her formidable armor bonus, she had been nearly killed by the centaurs and would certainly have been destroyed by them if not for the timely interference of the bloodsoaked child. Shakily, she asked for the name of her rescuer.\n\nPratena took a brief pause from her kill to write her name in the dirt. Virkri meekly asked if she knew where to find a blacksmith, so that she could mend her armor. Pratena did, and gestured for her new partner to grab the other dead centuar- they were going to visit home, and Pratena might get hungry.\n\nOnce there, Pratena's mother and father were delighted (if a bit confused) to see her again so soon. However, the sight of her fresh kills lifted their spirits- they wouldn't have to slaughter another cow today. They directed the damaged Virkri to the smithy and allowed her use of their tools while Pratena visited the local butcher and asked if he could turn 1.5 centaur corpses into some tasty jerky.\n\nWhen they were finished, Pratena's father came bearing some news- some human travelers had been whining about bandit attacks nearby, and there might be a reward if they were killed. Pratena and Virkri perked right up at that, and set off to do what adventurers do best- wanton slaughter.\n\nThe ruined fort they came upon had two entrances, both covered by foliage. Virkri, being made of metal, was not adept at sneaking and thus could not be counted on to scout out the entrances. Pratena, though, was small enough to hide behind a rosebush and spy a bandit flipping a dagger inside a crumbling entryway. She immediately burst out, still covered in blood from her meal before, and made distressed motions to the puzzled bandit. He and his nearby friend came forward, goggling at the weeping child covered in blood and tiny scrapes (from the rosebush). When one bandit asked why she had come here, Pratena looked up, stopped weeping and made a single gesture in sign language.\n\n\"Meat.\"\n\nThat was about when the screaming started.\n\nVirkri charged from the bushes, smashing a bandit's head into a wall, while another bandit inside watched the gore-spattered child swallow a chunk of his dead friend's throat. As men in such situations are wont to do, he toppled backwards and pissed himself.\n\nVirkri charged forward again, readying her spear for an attack, when she suddenly slipped on a weird wet patch, fell on her metallic ass, and dropped her spear on the opposite side of the terrified bandit. Pratena used her freakishly strong arms to break another bandit's neck. There were more coming- another bandit rounded the corner of the entryway and raised a shield as Pratena made another flying leap at his throat. He blocked her attack, and then his two friends maneuvered around to trap and flank her. Unable to get up the momentum for a full pounce, Pratena backed towards the entryway of the ruined keep, her attackers keeping pace and making decent hits with their (rather inadequate) knives.\n\nVirkri, meanwhile, had finally hauled herself up and snatched her spear from the bandit who was ineffectually poking at her. One shield smash later, he was dead. But now she had a new problem- there were sounds of a scuffle outside and a bandit had just backed into view through the entryway. Virkri readied her shield and charged forward, knocking the man unconscious with a powerful blow that also sent him tumbling ass-over-teakettle into the rosebush, which killed him. Flanking lost, the remaining two bandits did not last much longer- Virkri smashed them, and Pratena ate them.\n\nJob done, the two searched the place for loot (electing not to strip the blood-soaked corpses down for their armor, they had some standards) and came up with a tidy sum of gold pieces, plus the heads of the bandits which they could likely turn in for a bounty. Then they marched home to the orc village to pawn their pilfered weapons and pick up Pratena's centaur jerkey.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Morally ambiguous food-service degree\", I DON'T HAVE A FREAKING CLUE!

It appears to becoming the tradition of one of my two RPG groups that we play sessions of Diplomacy between Campaigns, to give the next GM extra time to prepare a campaign. Well, our Serenity Campaign is over, so now's it diplomacy Sunday.\n\nIt's happening next Sunday (Eg: 8 days time) and, /r/gametales, I hope to post a relative full catalog of the entire game. Turn by Turn maps, my interpretations of each turn, it's going to be great.\n\nThere are no dice, cards or spinners in Diplomacy. The only random element are the players. We have, as a group, played Diplomacy together exactly *once*. One of the players has buggered off to Newcastle *Cough* **Richard-2** *Cough*, we've got a whole host of new folk, and some of the players simply didn't play the first time.\n\nHowever, us Veterans from the last game will play under the shadow of the last game, and so it's only fair, given that I've covering the next one, that you know the Biases. Codenames from Alien Franchise, will be carried over to Game 2, assigned without regard *much* regard to their actions in the first game. Players who controlled factions in the first game will have faction name appended in Brackets.\n\n**Ash (Germany):** Despite what what the name tells you, Ash held, as far as I could tell, held true to his deals and promises throughout the first game. Slow, Steady Expansion throughout the game, consistently Power Number 3 throughout the first game. --One to Watch\n\n**Burke (Austria):** Despite what the nam- Nah. During the first game, he expanded steadily in collusion with **Richard-2 (Italy)** and **Ripley (Turkey)**. Later on in game, fearing treachery from **Richard-2**, attempted to collude with **Ripley** to take apart **Richard-2**. **Ripley** feigned consent, informed **Richard-2**. **Ripley** and **Richard-2** pulled in **Ash**, who, between them, halved  his Territory in a single turn. **Burke** then begged for a truce, which was granted due to the need to fight **Parker**. --One to watch\n\n**Dallas (Russia):** Steered the direction of the first game through his absence in the 'Turn Zero' phase: The remaining six players split into two alliances organising how to carve up his holdings Russia. Deprived of allies and assaulted on all sides, **Dallas** put up a hell of a fight, and Russia lasted a lot longer than anyone expected it to. --One to Watch\n\n**Ferro:** From my perspective, new to the group, but actually an old member who took a hiatus. Did not take part in the first game. Expected Competence: High. --One to Watch\n\n**Hicks:** A new member to the group, relative newbie to the RPG Scene. Did not take part in the first game. Expected Competence: Middle to High.\n\n**Lambert:**  Partnered with **Parker** in control of the UK in the first game, **Lambert** was fairly obviously the junior partner. Has expressed intent to partner again in eight days, request will likely be granted assuming player numbers are high enough.\n \n**Parker (United Kingdom):** **Parker**, **Parker**, **Parker**. **Parker** broke his Turn-Zero deals on turn one, playing his betrayal off as confusion and miscommunication, expanded rapidly. At his height, he controlled 17 supply centers, one short of total victory, with an Empire stretching from London to St. Petersburg to Lisbon. His belligerence forced every single other player into alliance against him, but dislodging him was difficult due to his Naval superiority, but was being pushed back when the game ended. Will likely not be trusted again. I certainly won't. --One to Watch\n\n**Ripley (Turkey):** Colluded faithfully with **Burke** and **Richard-2**, with a clean division of the Balkans between her and **Burke** allowing for a steady expansion early game. Pushed into Russia, battled with **Parker** for Russian and Nordic Lands. Counter-Betrayed **Burke** along with **Richard-2** and **Ash.** Benefited greatly from the wars against **Parker.** On the last turn of the game, betrayed all of her allies to take 3 supply centers in one turn, bringing her to the Number 1 position by Supply Centers controlled, and thus named the Game's victor. --One to Watch\n\n**Full Disclosure: I assigned the Ripley Codename to myself.**\n\n**Vasquez**: New player, relative newbie to the RPG scene. Did not take part in the first RPG game. Expected Competence: Middle to High.\n\n---\n\n**Resources**\n\n[Diplomacy Map:](http://www.diplom.org/Online/maps/map_c.gif) Note the Sun-type Icons in some zones. These are 'Supply Centers:' Every second turn, Players can raise new Armies and Fleets (But only in their Home Supply Centers, eg: UK can only raise new armies/fleets in Edinburgh, Liverpool and London) if they control more Supply Centers than their combined total of Armies and Fleets. Conversely, if they have more armies and fleets than their Supply Centers can support, they must disband armies and fleets until the totals come into line.\n\n[Diplomacy Ruleset:](http://faculty.washington.edu/majeski/426/sim1.html) [WARNING: LONG] There's an old joke that says that deciding how to play diplomacy is a game of diplomacy in itself, and I've just proposed an alteration to the rules...

        "text": "So a few months back, I was playing in a game with my usually weekly group. The world was home brew pathfinder, a world being brought into an ice age through the influence of Gruumsh (Of course we don't learn this till later on). \n\nMy party consisted of a Barbarian, a cleric healer, an elf thief (with a bow), and me a druid\n\nAs we were traveling we got into a fight with these giant monkey things, anoying things that had a climb speed and swung around on vines and would throw \"dirt\" at us.\n\nUnfortunately since these things spent most of the time up in the trees it was hard for our barbarian to kill them, and our elf had the worst set of cursed dice ever (Actually it became the joke that all elves in this world setting were idiots, none that traveled with us had much success.) So it came to me and my small amount of ranged spells at my low level to get these things out of the trees. \n\nOne of my favorite spells to use was flaming sphere, which at first I didn't think would help out that much in this situation, Until I read the rules. Turns out as part of the movement it gets to make, my orb can jump or ascend. So I have it rolling around and jumping to kill things. Well on the last turn, the nearest enemy was 20 feet out, and 20 feet up. That's a total of 40 feet with the vertical jump, 10 feet out of range. But what's this? My ball of fire can **ascend** as well as jump. \n\nAs soon as I tell my GM what I am planing on doing, everyone looks at me and stares ( I may be used to this by now, I have kinda gotten a rap of being the guy to poke things with sticks). I calmly explain, that if my ball can ascend in a straight line, using Pythagorean theorem I know that with a triangle that has 20 feet on two sides, the hypotenuse is going to be 28 something, which is just under 30 the max move for my orb. \n\nThe game pauses for a few minutes, to make sure the gm cannot find any obvious rule that says I can't do this, not so much wanting to bust my creativity, but because it was so outrageous he hadn't thought of it. tells me to roll damage, and I finish of the damn monkey thing.",

        "text": "[When last we met,] (http://redd.it/2lxi69) Anderson was gradually thawing after being removed from his personalized meat locker, Flint and Chatya were tending to all the details of camp, and Darek was off being chaotic stupid in a snowstorm after the three had efficiently dealt with a small pack of sevelods.\n\nDetermined to gather another trophy for himself (even though he didn't kill it in the first place) Darek continues to stumble on through howling wind and blinding snow, miraculously avoiding pitfalls into the lake and somehow makes it to his quarry. Struggling to handle the stiff dead weight of the massive creature, it takes him nigh on half an hour to salvage a suitable hunk of fur before he begins to lose sensation in his fingers. Lady luck practically offering herself to him, he trudges back to shelter without a single complication or doubt in his path, and anxiously waits to see if his nose is going to fall off at some point in the night.\n\nAfter Darek's return, Flint and Chatya begin to discuss their options should Anderson fail to recover. Retreat is mentioned, but Flint is determined to succeed, as part of his agreement with the Queen included the requisition and staffing of a particular ship based on the specifications provided by a certain aging sea-farer, who's whole adult life has been focused on acquiring such a vessel. He suggests instead that they simply refer to Anderson's map and push on... And they realize that Anderson kept his *paper* map in his coat, *which Flint had stripped from him and flung aside after pulling him away from the ice's edge.* Resigned to the ungodly level of misery she's about to succumb to in order to keep herself and her bumbling idiots alive, Chatya envelopes herself in the largest, thickest fur she can find, and wriggles out from the burrow's snowed over entrance, weaving methodically through the ever deeper drifts until she finally uncovers Anderson's coat, frozen into one solid chunk of ice. She's forced to spend hours slowly melting out the lump and soaking up the runoff with whatever cloth they can spare, until she's able to extricate the map and dab away the moisture bit by bit until it's malleable again. Her painstaking efforts are rewarded with a mostly legible charcoal sketch that Flint is able to copy onto more durable skin.\n\nWatches are assigned, hours pass, meager meals are choked down, and come morning Anderson is back in the game! Though much more feeble and sluggish than when they started out, he pulls himself together and leads the way once more. Two uneventful days pass and the group encounters the first of what will be many inconceivably large chasms, sudden rifts in the landscape that drop hundreds of feet with nothing to impede the longest and last fall of your life. As they continue to proceed closer to their destination, a massive mountain nestled between several smaller ridges, more and more chasms appear on the horizon, smaller than the first but just as steep and deep. Anderson warns that should they hear or feel any disturbance on the surface to turn and race away, because their lives *will* depend on it.\n\nWith this advice in mind they press on, and are met with the awe inspiring spectacle of their destination: the Lap of God. The mountain peak before them is defined by a deeply etched draw rippling up to a most peculiar formation- twin buttresses, near identical, jutting from the slope to form a sudden, angular shift from vertical to horizontal before disappearing again in to the mountain. The peculiarity of these arcs is matched by the mountain peak itself, rather than tapering off to form a roughly triangular shape, it abandons the obtuse and irregular angles of the mountain proper and shoots ever upwards in a smooth spire that disappears out of sight. Combined, the image is that of a seated figure, impossibly large, embedded into the mountain itself, as if a man had piled up a large heap of sand, plopped down on it, and dug his toes in deep until they were refreshingly cool.\n\nSoon enough our crew made their way to the foot of this mountain, managing to avoid all but one mishap with the precarious nature of their terrain (the ground began to give way under Darek and Chatya's sled, they were able to outrun the worst of it and survived a cliffhanger moment, with the dogs and Darek heaving Chatya and the sled back from the brink). Entrusting the dogs to their own devices, the four took what essentials they could carry on their backs and made their way up the mountain.\n\nThree days pass, and the team has made it to the top of the draw and found, nestled firmly in what Flint has dubbed the Giant's Crotch, an artfully chiseled ice facade creating an imposing but breathtaking entrance into a cave equal parts stone and ice, gravel and snow mixed to provide questionable footing along the way. Invigorated by the signs of artificial influence and the promise of shelter from the winds, the party delves into the tunnel without question. Within, they find torches unnecessary, as the veins of ice throughout the rock act as fiberoptic cables, taking light from the mountain exterior and providing a conduit into the cavern depths. But while lighting is no issue, navigation is something else entirely. No matter which way they go every path, and there are several, seems to lead to nowhere, or more specifically the central hub of the cave which they soon began to call the Nexus. Over, under, looping around and back again, they'd find themselves at the Nexus. Spiraling down, crawling through gaps, up chiselled out ladders and through caverns, and back at the Nexus. The only path that didn't lead directly back to where they started was a straight ramp down directly to a pit of lava, bubbling calmly in the deepest part of the system, and even that had a small gap in the rock that led to another back passage that brought them back once more to that thrice-cursed Nexus.\n\nBeginning to despair that this cave was abandoned long ago, the troupe makes their way back up the ramp when Chatya notices something odd, a perfectly straight, even line across the ramp floor. On closer inspection the line is discovered to be a depression in the ramp floor, a foot wide and spanning the breadth of the hallway, but only perhaps 1/8\" deep, and situated squarely halfway between the top and bottom of the ramp. Darek, the spirit of caution, pokes the depression with the butt of his spear.\n\nThere is a deep rumble. A dull scraping sound echoes from somewhere far away. Chatya makes an offensive commentary on her companion's intelligence. And then they hear the unmistakable sloshing of a current overhead.\n\nPanicking, the party briefly argues about their course of action before opting for \"Down, we go down really really fast\". For Darek, \"really really fast\" is notably faster than the other three, and he knocks friends aside in a mad dash for safety. Chatya spares enough breath for one choice oath of pain before chasing after, whilst Flint and Anderson huff and puff in the rear trying to recall the vigor of younger years. As the party reaches 3/4's down the ramp, the avalanche of snow bursts from the hidden trapdoor at the top and rushes down to meet them, leaving them with only the side passage or fiery death. Darek reaches the mouth of the passage, braces himself against the far wall, and holds out his spear to help shepherd in the rest. Chatya dives in unaided, Anderson's momentum is forcibly redirected, but Flint's feet are knocked from under him by the tide of snow just feet from safety. As he lands on his back and is swept past the door Darek slaps the haft of his spear into Flint's hand and begins to haul him up towards the passage doorway. Chatya joins the struggle and they get him up high enough to grasp his arms to heave him in. Breathless, numb, and quickly getting pinned against the wall by a steady accumulation from the flow currently turning into an impressive fog cloud, the party wades deeper into the passage to put some distance between themselves and the trap.\n\nThey make their way back to the Nexus and collapse, exhausted, and vow to resume the search tomorrow. One thing they're confident of, no one traps a labyrinth if they don't plan on staying, and if there are hidden tunnels for an avalanche, why not hidden tunnels for dwarves?\n\nFinally, after another day of scouring for any little detail they may have missed and a hunch from Anderson that someone may have hidden another passage with an artificial ice wall designed to blend with the cavern, the group spots one particular icicle that is simply too perfect, a symmetrical cone situated against the eastern wall of a curving hall that seems to extend further east than the others. \n\nDarek, of course, pokes the icicle with his spear.\n\nIt breaks from the cavern ceiling, crashes to the floor, and shatters, and there is a long awkward pause as Darek scans every surface expectantly. Chatya rubs her temples and sighs \"It was an arrow, you mook. Break the ice *there*.\"\n\nHiding his shame with physical exertion, Darek attacks the wall with his trusty ice pick, not once stopping for rest until finally punching through a door three feet thick, exposing the smooth, straight, polished stone of the wall beyond. There's a faint orange glow coming from the left, and a brighter, wavering one on the right, but other than that the party sees nothing. They excitedly break open a sizable pathway through the ice door, until they're able to step inside two abreast. After days of struggle, near death experiences, and a constant state of shivering misery, Darek's patience is at an end, and he storms into the hallway and to the right, ready to get this mission over with already. Chatya and Flint remain just within the hall entrance, prepared to draw their weapons but fighting their instinct to do so in order to present a more civil first impression to an undoubtedly paranoid clan. Anderson remains on the other side of the door, updating the map he had been drafting through this ordeal and watching their backs in case of an ambush.\n\nDarek walks towards the nearby light source and steps into the doorway of what appears to be a supply store room. An assortment of tools hang from pegs on the walls between large lumpy garments knitted from a coarse, wiry material in a variety of browns and blacks interspersed with gray. At the far end of the room just beyond the circle of light provided by the torches in the wall sconces, he can make out the front end of a wooden stool, and the bottoms of two boots bobbing impatiently on it. Darek grabs one of the torches and calls out \"Is someone there?\", the boots go still, and a hushed, gruff voice replies \"Yes\". As he lifts the torch higher, Darek sees a squat, clean shaven individul with a vial in hand reach out and pull a metal lever, and with a sudden crash a new ice door drops down, crushing the remnants of the old and sealing the trio within.\n\nDarek leaps further into the room and wields his spear defensively as Chatya and Flint turn to the room to cover him. He tries to appease the dwarf, assuring him they mean no harm. The man on the stool seems unconvinced. \"Why did you come all this way, then?\"\nIn Dwarven, Darek responds. \"Because I have studied your great culture for many years. I came in the hopes to learn more of your people.\"\n\nSurprise flickers on the dwarf's face, but he quickly composes himself, and grinning, responds in turn. \"Tell me, then, human. In your studies did you learn anything about this?\" He holds the vial aloft and then rolls it across the floor unstoppered, allowing a strange blue fluid to pour onto the floor, vapors roiling from it to thicken the air above the small puddle. Darek, stumped, shakes his head. \"I do not know of this substance.\"\n\nThe dwarf grins. \"Oh good.\"\n\n...\n\nIf you got this far, congrats! I hope you enjoyed and will stay tuned for the finale, and sorry I took so long to write out this update.",

More specifically, [the Shambles](http://i.imgur.com/ORX539k.jpg), the northern district of the mainland city, where Mother Alvra runs her orphanage. A district with a smoke-stained history, the streets wind and twist, and buildings are an eclectic mix of run-down old styles and newer, cheap housing. We join our heroes six months after the previous session.\n\n**The Player Characters**\n\nSaldo: The dashing, somewhat dumb kid with a passion for wrestling and shooting. He has spent the past six months training with Sal, a Sannosimma gunsmith with a passion for the martial art Sanhar. When he isn't training with Sal, he is helping Mother Alvra with her errands or causing mischief with his orphan siblings. Pretty tough for a nine year old.\n\nGorvis: A caster and a trickster, he goes where he wants, when he wants. The past six months have seen him working (nominally) as a shop-keeper with Jormind Bedrek of Jormind's Discount Securities, a locksmith who is willing to teach Gorvis how to make tumblers dance. He makes folks reconsider the scheming capabilities of eleven year olds.\n\nIngevla: A far-flung apple from a stunted noble family tree, she's been spending her free time as a lady-in-waiting for a low-noble household in the city. When her mouth isn't getting her into trouble, it's getting her out of it. For being ten years old, she's smarter than you'd think.\n\n**Our Newcomers**\n\nFelix: He's one scruffy-looking nerfherder of a twelve year old, a fact he's perfectly willing to hold over Gorvis's head. Also perfectly willing to arm himself with his pretty face and foul mouth, he's a tough little sucker. Sold to Mother Alvra from the same batch as Chaya.\n\nChaya (kai-ah): The studious scholar of the group, Chaya's family taught her a smattering of Alchemical Philosophy before they died in a way she refuses to speak of. She's a tiny pacifist, though her brewing and Alchemical skills are far ahead of her peers, and you'd be shocked to learn she's only eleven.\n\nWe begin six months later, as Alvra introduces the two newcomers to the other orphans. Before she leaves on her daily errands she gives them the new rule talk: No magic in-doors, no fighting or thieving among yourselves, and to not go in her room. When she leaves, she also lets them know that, over the past few days, a gang of good-for-nothing street rats have been dropping crap down the chimney. She wants them to figure out who and stop them, but to cause no lasting injuries or deaths. Alvra specifically says this to Gorvis, Inge, and Saldo before leaving.\n\nWhile the other kids are talking, Gorvis goes outside and climbs onto the roof where the chimney is. He takes out some grease he's found out in the city and liberally coats the roof around the chimney. Inside the group plans and goes outside, where Gorvis suggests he hide in a barrel and let them know when he sees someone coming. It's mid-day, so the prospect of locking ~~Cartman~~ Gorvis away for a while appeals to them. They decide on some whistle codes and wait.\n\nWhile he sits in the barrel, the rest of them decide to show the newcomers the town. Inge and Saldo take Felix and Chaya to a nearby tavern where there is known to be a large number of street kids in attendance. After Felix underestimates Volbruggar ale's potency, they notice two kids in the corner. Felix and Inge approach while Saldo and Chaya try and gather rumors from overhearing the other patrons.\nAfter some well-done diplomacy, Felix and Inge get the kids to open up that there is a gathering that night at a run-down storefront. They give them directions and scoot. Meanwhile, Chaya and Saldo learn that other people have also had crap dropped down their chimneys at night.\n\nThe plot thickens.\n\nThey head back to the orphanage, where they find Gorvis has went back to his bed and rooted through their stuff. After some harsh words, Inge shares that she's never felt like anyone wanted her and that she just wants to belong. They inform Gorvis of their escapades and make a plan to stake out the place that night.\n\nThe storefront is a two-and-a-half level affair. After staking it out, they see a few kids enter and go inside. It seems to be a gathering of the district's streetgangs, and there's one kid who seems to be in charge. He hops up on a table and announces that it's time for that night's game of Shits and Giggles to begin. The goal is to dump as much crap, either literal or figurative, down as many chimneys as possible. Whoever wins gets a bag of coin they lifted off a merchant earlier that day. The last winners were the Broken Bottle gang, and Alvra's kids (unnamed as of this moment) have joined up to take it down from the inside.\n\nThey find a map of a few tanneries that leave their vats open at night and make their way towards one. With little effort they hop the fence and fill two sacks halfway with offal, while scaring off some kids who were targeting the same place. On their way back to the hideout, they almost get apprehended by some constables, but quick thinking with one of Chaya's Obscure potions gets them safely away.\nOn the way back, Felix can't help but lower his pants and drop a 10/10 turd down some poor person's chimney.\n\nWhen they arrive at the hideaway they see that Gorvis's trap has caused a kid to twist his ankle and return early. In order for their plan to go right, Inge buddies up to him, takes him to a nearby bar, and fills him with enough liquor to make a ten-year-old drunk. There aren't minimum drinking ages here, whatever.\nWith Chaya on watch at the front door and Saldo up high on a balcony, Felix and Gorvis set up their trap: they place three of Chaya's Obscure potions (functionally identical to smoke bombs) in the bottom of the sacks and hoist them to the top of the inside. Gorvis takes the rope and climbs outside onto the roof, and the rest leave and wait across the street in an alleyway.\n\nAfter all the street kids have returned, they drop the bag. The smoke inside the shattered potions carries the stinking odor of animal offal as Felix holds the door, causing the kids to be engulfed in the stench. They make their getaway and return to the orphanage (contemplating leaving Gorvis), where Inge ties an intestine around the chimneypipe as a warning.\n\nA few days later, Alvra is impressed that the kids have succeeded so well that they are being given a wide berth by the other street kids. She buys them all some maple candy as a reward.\n\n**The End**\n\nNext time: After a ten-year time skip, the orphans are called back to Dodushkun by vague, yet distressed letters from Mother Alvra. But for what purpose?\n\nDun dun duuuuun!",

On their way back to the hideout, they almost get apprehended by some constables, but quick thinking with one of Chaya's Obscure potions gets them safely away.\n\nOn the way back, Felix can't help but lower his pants and drop a 10/10 turd down some poor person's chimney.\n\nWhen they arrive at the hideaway they see that Gorvis's trap has caused a kid to twist his ankle and return early. In order for their plan to go right, Inge buddies up to him, takes him to a nearby bar, and fills him with enough liquor to make a ten-year-old drunk. There aren't minimum drinking ages here, whatever.\n\nWith Chaya on watch at the front door and Saldo up high on a balcony, Felix and Gorvis set up their trap: they place three of Chaya's Obscure potions (functionally identical to smoke bombs) in the bottom of the sacks and hoist them to the top of the inside. Gorvis takes the rope and climbs outside onto the roof, and the rest leave and wait across the street in an alleyway.\n\nAfter all the street kids have returned, they drop the bag. The smoke inside the shattered potions carries the stinking odor of animal offal as Felix holds the door, causing the kids to be engulfed in the stench. They make their getaway and return to the orphanage (contemplating leaving Gorvis), where Inge ties an intestine around the chimneypipe as a warning.\n\nA few days later, Alvra is impressed that the kids have succeeded so well that they are being given a wide berth by the other street kids. She buys them all some maple candy as a reward.\n\n**The End**\n\n**Next time:** After a ten-year time skip, the orphans are called back to Dodushkun by vague, yet distressed letters from Mother Alvra. But for what purpose?\n\nDun dun *duuuuun!*",

        "text": "This is the end of a long campaign. My mate played a one-armed Dwarven monk nicknamed \"The Dawn Arrow\". Yes, this all happened. Yes, it was glorious.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Undoing, The Master of the Void, the Scourge of Drexlor, Master of the Eld, once-Archwizard of the Veiled Tower of Gandahar, once-Elder Mage of the Regan Kingdom, once keyholder of the Shrouded Cloister, Okotarg Øk, and oft-called Okotarg-the-Deformed, the Dread Unmaking, was gripped in the throes of a howling roar of laughter, though his throne room rumbled and the walls of his citadel shook and the bellows of bloodthirsty fiends howled at his empire’s door. Tears streamed from his ancient eyes and he was doubled over, hands-on-knees, cackling and sniggering in a desperate struggle with the situation at hand. He was losing the fight and the stress of being trapped for so long had started to disintegrate his mental faculties and he could not help but laugh at the absurdity of the whole sorry mess.\n\n\nThe massive granite room shook again and a crack appeared in a nearby column, showering dust and small debris down onto the Void Master's head. He suddenly sobered, and pulled himself up to his full stature, and shook his fists at the air, bellowing, “Howl, you fiends! Howl and harrow the earth! You'll not have me!” He began to pace, a long purple-silver threaded carpet marked his steps, and the tower shook again, harder this time.\nThe ancient elf's face was creased in rage. He was so close! Out of spite he considered the seven unfinished sigils on the wall of the Temple, below. He was supposed to be leading the damn army, not trapped here, and accepted that finishing the seven keys and beginning the invasion without him there was preferable to nearly eight-hundred years of work spoiled, and all for a fool dwarf! Pah! One-armed, and one-bloody-minded as well!\n\n\nHe spat, the black spittle landing on the decorative carpeting, where it lay for a moment or two, before beginning to twitch. In a minute the black glob had quadrupled in size, and was taking on a definite shape.\nOkotarg rubbed his ancient hands and spoke aloud, invoking the ancient rules and protections of the necromancer's trade, and spun lines of mathematical invocations to bind and energize the proxy. The lyrical drone of divinatory magic followed next, and the package was sealed with The Void's personal sigil and the glob suddenly took the form on a tiny humanoid. It took a few small steps, leapt into flight and vanished from the visible spectrum.\nThe ancient arch-wizard cackled again. “Find the Key. Fly true!”\n\n\nOutside, the fury of the Key and his army were beginning to take their toll on the colossal alien black slabs that made up the dizzying wall of the Citadel of the Void, which were three spikes ringed around a thick finger of stone, mottled with a luminescent purple mineral. The heights were incalculable here in the Void. This was Okotarg's personal domain, a sub-harmonic of the Prime Drexlor, and its laws were mutable.\n\n\nBut the Army of the Key would not be assuaged. They did not fear the swirling purple and black vortex that dominated the “sky” here. They did not whisper in alarm at the endless grey plains of nothingness that seemed to comprise this entire plane. When the first swarms of rotting ghouls, some winged, came boiling out of the unearthly fortress, they did not run or cry aloud.\nThey were the Returned, 10000 spirits-of-warriors, bound by an ancient compact to serve the Key, a leader they called Moham-of-the-Rock. They would not be stopped. Not when the horrors of the ghouls' paralytic bites dropped hundreds in the first minutes of battle. They would not be driven away. Not when the ghouls were stinking meat and the air was thick with the silent terror of shadow-fiends, and not when the last of the Citadel's defenders; howling hordes of running zombies came like a sea of death.\nThey would not be broken.\n\nThe Key howled for victory and threw his dwindling army again at the endless walls of the Spires of Ur. There could be no victory without death. The Screaming Lands themselves would fall if it was commanded by the Dawn Arrow. Moham-the-Key, distracted as he was by the insanity of battle here in this unnatural place, could feel the dread power of the trapped Necromancer, leaching through his will, crumbling the edges, mixed with sharp stabbing pains to relent, submit, yield and find peace, and it was getting harder and harder to resist the constant barrage of psychic probing. He shifted his mental armor again, a desperate bid to keep out the onslaught from the Unmaking, and sent in his reserves, which were now only in the scant hundreds. They needed to clear the field, now, before the Unmaking decided to sally onto the field himself, and really make things interesting.\n\n\nMoham looked again for the Archer, some clue or sign that he was watching, was protecting them all, but he saw nothing, just the endless grey plains of the Void’s dominion, the millions of undead who once waited here for a word from the Unmaking’s lips were long gone, hidden in five massive armies around the Realms, just waiting for the command to begin. If they failed here and if the Key breaks, and The Dawn Arrow fails, then everything that mattered to the Key and this army of men and women from Drexlor’s storied past would be lost to the machinations of the Void and his plans to destroy the world. “If only we could get inside”, the Key thought, “then the Arrow would fly true and I could stand by his side once again, and feel the old ways return, and find peace.” He almost let a smile touch his face, and in that moment his defense slipped just enough.\nThe phantasmal killer that was once a glob of spit, and who had been waiting, patiently, fulfilled its purpose, slipped past Mohab's crumbling mental shields and the relentless painful strands of the Void’s will snaked inwards and the Key felt his mind crack and he knew that he was lost.\n\n\nAt that moment the relentless efforts of the Army of the Key overcame the stubborn, alien stone and the huge main gates of the Citadel of the Void broke into one-ton pieces and tumbled to the ground, to the roar of the ranks who now streamed into the unknown, songs of ancient kings on their lips and renewed vows of victory. Though they knew that the Key had fallen, and that their connection to this harmonic would quickly unravel, they vowed to honor the Key's last request – to remove the head of Okotarg-the-Deformed before they were returned to the Flux, from which they were called so many years ago. How many years? None could say. The Army of the Key were not flesh and blood and had no concern with time. But Master Okotarg knew. Nearly 3 years these fiends had besieged his home and kept him here.\n\n\nHe heard the defenses fall and knew that it was time. Okotarg called upon the primal force of the universe that resided inside himself. It was not his. The All-father, Zendaya, lost it when he was forced to create the last of the gods, when his being shattered and Zendaya faded from the universe. The Force of Unmaking, the power to destroy...everything.\nUsed it to create an army so large even the dwarven juggernaut of the Feclan Empire could not stand up to its power. Used it to subvert and poison every standing circle used by the Canathane, and used it to create this very dimension where he now faced annihilation.\n\n\nThe Force of Unmaking answered one will. Its own. Okotarg had called on it again and again to destroy the besieging army but it would not answer him.\nBut now he felt the dread power swell within him, like poison into water, and the sick, horrible, wonderful, terrible feeling filled his essence and gave him the power to finish the final strokes of the seven Command sigils that would awaken the Army of the Dead Hand. He roared in Arcan, and felt the power flood from him, etching dweomer through time and space. The Command sigils flared into existence, and he felt the stored power of eight-hundred years gush out of him as water from a pipe, and he wept and cried and laughed aloud and felt the last of the Army of the Key winking out of existence and for a moment he considered the possibility of victory.\n\n\nThen a tug at his inner mind. A reverberation in his core. He had felt it before.\nOkotarg made a sound like an animal lost in a dark wood. A chundering, chuffing sound, short and curt, full of bass and growl.\n\n\nOverhead, far above the silent grey plains and the colossal citadel, a spike of light appeared in the swirling vortex. It fractured, and grew, and fractured again and again, like a crack growing in ice. The brightening light started racing outwards at an ever quickening pace, and soon covered a quarter of the swirling skies.\nIt seemed to slow for a moment, and stop, momentarily.\nOkotarg-the-Unmaking raced for his balcony window and looked up at the impossible scene. He howled in denial and he cast spell after dread spell at the splintering sky.\n\n\nThe scene held its breath for a moment longer, and then the sky split and fractured, like panes of glass falling, and the gloom was replaced with a blinding, dominating light, and the unearthly harmonics of the universal chord flooded the now-crumbling Unrealm, shouting power so loudly that Okotarg clapped his hands to his wrinkled ears and cried aloud in pain.\n\n\nThis was the Force of Making. There could be no doubt. The other half of Zendaya Allfather's lost power, it had been found by Master Wei Chi and his adventuring group long in Drexlor's turbulent past and had passed it, secretly, to the only surviving student of a massacre three decades gone.\n\n\nThe Force of Making had only one purpose. To reunite with its lost half and return Zendaya Allfather from oblivion. The sky was dominated by the shining, spreading, creation of the Force of Making. A single warrior appeared in the core of the light, one-armed, barefoot. He was grinning.\n\n\nThe Dawn Arrow had arrived.",

        "text": "Previous session here: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2m71cx/savage_worlds_tour_of_darkness_session_2_ed_the/\n***\nLast week the squad encountered strange happenings while investigating an NVA camp, and their troubles aren’t over just yet! We lost two of the Extras last time: Swaggs to friendly fire and Zander to promotion, so two fresh faces have been added to the squad.\n\nAndrew D. as PV2. Nelson Vaughn, the medic/radioman  \nNate L. as Pvt. Huey O’Reilly, the machine gunner  \nJoe U. as PV2. John Winchester, the marksman  \nAdam T. as PV2. Joseph Butters, the grenadier  \nAlex Q. as Alec King, rifleman/’apprentice’ medic  \n\nWe also have a complement of NPC Extras, one for each player:  \nSgt. Frank “The Tank” LeBlanc, squad leader  \nPV1. Jeremy “Pothead” Pruett, the assistant gunner  \nPvt. Edward Christopher, another rifleman  \nPvt. Hudson “Hudd” Dodd, another rifleman  \nPvt. Isaiah “Geek” Ryder, another rifleman  \n\nIt has only been a few hours since the squad has returned from their strange mission at the NVA camp. They are trying to rest up after such a stressful experience, but Colonel Cormac returns and needs their help. He wants to return to the camp with a group of experts to comb over everything, to determine the origin of the blob monster they fought. This would be a top secret mission, and he wanted them since they had been with him last time. Less people to silence.\n\nThe squad stocked up on ammunition and re-filled the medkits, and mounted up into the Huey slick waiting for them. The team of specialists got into another slick, and a Huey gunship was preparing its rotors as well. It would provide any needed support during the mission.\n\nDuring the flight, Cormac admitted to seeing the other work the squad had done a month ago. He said that the briefcase contained an artifact they didn’t want falling into enemy hands. He also admitted to examining Huey’s photographs from the same mission.\n\nAfter an hour’s flight, the choppers touched down in the rice paddies near the village of Sai Trong, heading past on an overland route to the NVA camp. The villagers were upon them as soon as they got off the helicopters, begging for help. Apparently about one-third of the village was sick with some disease. Nelson and Alec set about seeing what they could do to help, and they gave what medicine they could to combat the jungle disease. After spending an hour doing that, Cormac urged them onwards. The VC would be moving in to investigate the camp soon, and he wanted to get there before they did.\n\nThey left the village and started on the three hour trek through the jungle. Along the way, the ground gave out beneath Geek, but a quick jump saved him from falling into the tiger pit trap. However, the VC surrounding the trap were not happy to see their trap fail. The squad dropped to position and fired into the thick brush. Butters fired a grenade and there was silence, and Winchester went to investigate. He found a few dead and one wounded, he used his pistol to ease him into the afterlife. The squad regrouped and started back on the trail.\n\nAfter another hour, Geek was talking with the squad. He talked about how back in the States he was an engineer for his father’s company. Alec butted in, saying that back home he did a stint as a ‘doctor’ for drug mules coming into New Mexico. The whole squad fell silent and Huey was visibly perturbed by this.\n\nThe conversation ends and the last hour is taken up by silence, and the squad reaches the abandoned camp. It still smells of ozone, and there are still marks where the blob’s acidic mass hit the tents and ground. Cormac and the specialists headed for the office to pull through any paperwork they could find. The squad broke into defensive positions. Winchester and Hudd climbed the guard tower to provide overwatch, Huey and Pothead decided to mull around the armory, Sarge and Nelson took up position at the mess tent, and Butters, Alec, Geek, and Ed stood around the old well. They searched for any more blob monsters, but there was none.\n\nAfter a half an hour, Alec noticed something moving in the trees, about eighty yards away. The group took cover behind the well, waiting for trouble, but it was coming slowly. Butters decided to take advantage of this, and launched a grenade. The gunfire started from both sides, though each had a hard time shooting one-another. From atop the guard tower Winchester plugged a few more, peering down his scope to confirm the kills. Sarge and Nelson heard the commotion, and started running towards them. In the armory, Huey and Pothead heard the gunfire and grabbed two RPGs to go and help.\n\nWhile Butters kept launching grenades and the others shooting blindly into the bush, Pothead appeared with both RPGs. He dropped one and fired into the trees, but nothing happened, it was a dud round. Winchester almost got hit by a keen-eyed VC sniper, but the cover of the tower’s walls saved him and Hudd.\n\nSarge and Nelson joined them at the well as the gunfire continued. Butters kept laying down fire with his grenade launcher, and Pothead lined up another RPG shot. However, he was shot across the chest, scratching him to no damage, but throwing off his aim. The rocket went flying upwards, and the support gunship starting screaming into Nelson’s ear about what was happening on the ground. Cormac appeared at the office door shouting for a situation report.\n\nThe group kept firing into the jungle for another round, until they realized that everything was indeed silent. They decided that they’d need to investigate, and Winchester and Butters wanted to confirm some kills. They left Nelson, Sarge, and Pothead behind, all the rest formed a line and walked into the brush.\n\nAs they reached into the thick foliage trouble began. While the squad is quick, the VC happened to have the jump this time. Five shapes appeared, and two guerrillas leapt up and charged the line with bayonets, and both Winchester and Alec were stabbed for brutal damage. With those two fallen on the ground, the others quickly jumped into action. Butters jumped at the man stabbing Winchester, grabbing him in a chokehold, and snapped his neck. The body fell limp to the ground, and two of the VC started to flee. Ed and Geek missed their shots, and Huey lunged at another with his machete but got it stuck in a tree. The man stabbing Alec tried to punch Butters, but realized his mistake as his fist effortlessly pushed against the ferocious man’s chest. Butters had loaded his launcher with buckshot before entering the fray, and unloaded it straight into the man’s chest. He fell down dead. One VC had fled, but Winchester shot the last man standing, though bleeding out from his wounds.\n\nThe group at the well had heard the commotion and rushed to help. Nelson started patching up Alec, then started to work on Winchester, who was still badly wounded afterwards. They helped him up and started towards the camp again.\n\nWhen they reached it, they found Cormac and the specialists on their knees, held at gunpoint by what appeared to be three Americans dressed in camouflage without identifying patches, and armed with AKs. I ended the session on that cliffhanger.",

        "text": "So today on Toontown Rewritten, I decided to do a Cashbot Dollar Mint because I have four tasks for it. So, I'm sitting outside the HQ and three other toons show up, a bear, a mouse and a pig. We load up and head inside, everything is going nice and dandy for the most part until around the 2nd or 3rd wave, the bear disconnects. The mouse says he can use his Geyser gag on the last round, we'll be fine without him. Me and the pig think that is a good idea and continue in the mint.\n\n\nAround on the last few battles, the mouse disconnects. Shit has officially hit the fan. There's still three fights to go and its just me and the pig, If we go sad we lose everything, there was a chance where me and the pig could just give up and close the tab but it wasn't over for us. We had to use all of our strength to pass through the next few battles.\n\n\nBattle 1, pig used one of his big magnets and I wedding caked the cogs. Keep in mind Wedding Cakes are not easy to come by, you have to earn them via maxing throw. We did take a few hits but when he lured we tooned ourselves up. He said \"Well, hopefully the next battle is the final one\".\n\n\nHe was wrong.\n\n\nBattle 2, he uses his wedding cake and tells me to wait. I do just that and after the battle we devise a plan. Because we are both out of wedding cakes (You can only carry one each) we will attempt to take out the Foreman first, then attempt to lure the others.\n\n\n\nBattle 3, we immediately take out the foreman and attempt to lure twice, it fails taking out half of our health. He demolishes one of the cogs and we attempt to double lure with two $10 bills on the last two cogs.\n\n\nThat was the most intense moment in my TTR career, it all boils down to will the lure hit or miss, it will judge if we live or die. We wait and...SUCCESS. We take out the cogs one by one and toon up eachother. \n\n\nAnd that is the tale of the most intense Dollar Mint in TTR history. We lost two great men, used some of the most expensive and most powerful gags in the game, had to pray to lord to save us with lure and we nearly died ourselves. At least I got all four of my tasks done.",

        "text": "In the middle of a plot-heavy section of an increasingly cloak-and-dagger campaign, the party essentially took a session to blow off some steam in the time honored tradition of head cracking adventurers. \n\nThe party: \n\n* Nix, elf cleric of Milani. Street performer and dancer, easily distracted. \n* Arradon, half-elf investigator. Infatuated with Nix, prone to arson.\n* Whiskey, elf arcane trickster. Gets his memory psionically wiped after every crime he commits.\n* Cedric, human telepath. Rich and belligerent, but can really turn on the charm. \n\nIt started with a single goblin. Having just relocated to one of the shadier areas of a metropolis, Arradon was alarmed to discover that many of the houses in the neighborhood showed signs of forced entry. Whiskey pointed out a goblin hauling a burlap sack down the street as evening approached, and Arradon was gripped by a burning desire to know just what was in the bag. \n\nWhile the rest of the party was inclined to ignore a common goblin maybe-thief, Arradon was fairly single-minded, and everyone else threw up their hands and went along to make sure he didn't get into too much trouble. Stealthily tailing the goblin as it hauled its cargo down the street, they followed it to the most run down house in the neighborhood, and watched it disappear inside. \n\nIntrigued by what a goblin might be doing in a house, the brave idiots did the only rational thing; they circled the structure, buffed themselves to high heaven, kicked in the doors and went in like a goddamn SWAT team. Goblins erupted out of the woodwork to defend their hovel from the intruders, and the fight was on. \n\nArradon drank an extract and vomited spiders all over the first goblin he saw, which panicked and started trying to rid itself of the swarm. Cedric started laying down suppressive fire in the form of *concussive blasts*, and the elves went in the other side of the house, Whiskey with his throwing knives at the ready and Nix still buffing herself. Nix was the only one who had a bad feeling about this, and when she smelled engine oil that bad feeling intensified. And then Whiskey caught sight of a five foot tall goblin with claws instead of hands, and a gigantic pile of scrap metal that seemed to be moving. \n\nSince Arradon and Cedric were making a bigger racket, more goblins were swarming to the back of the house, tripping over themselves in the rush to overwhelm the invaders. One of the tougher ones accidentally stabbed the goblin covered in spiders, and another started hacking at Arradon with his horsechopper. Cedric started burning power points like crazy trying to clear the room, but there were simply too many of the little bastards.\n\nBack in the front of the house, Whiskey and Nix ended up in a sudden predicament when the pile of scrap metal revealed itself to be the salvaged torso of a warjack, modified by a goblin mechanic into the goofiest version of Dr. Octopus' back rig ever. The rig consisted of two massive gorilla arms, so huge that the goblin in question was lifted off the floor and had to use the hands to walk. He proved adroit, however, when he managed to stand on one hand and deliver a mighty punch with other, sending Nix flying. Whiskey was too busy engaging the giant clawed demon-goblin to aid her, and the mechanic clanked his way slowly towards the fallen cleric. \n\nArradon and Cedric were making headway against the swarm, but an unlucky swing of Arradon's rapier caught Cedric in the side, and the goblins began to wise up (i.e. stand around a corner and throw heavy objects at the invaders). Hearing the hiss of steam and the clanking of metal, they began to fight their way toward the front of the house to aid their friends. Arradon reached the doorway first, but had to duck back around the corner to avoid getting caught in a sudden blast of flame.\n\nThe giant clawed demon-goblin, not finding a gap in Whiskey's defense with it's claws, stepped back and threw a *burning hands* spell into the room, catching Nix flat-footed and clipping Doctor Goblin-puss, but missing Whiskey entirely. Whiskey danced out of the line of fire, leaving Nix completely exposed...and her screams fell abruptly short as the fire claimed her life. \n\nEverything stopped for a moment. Whiskey, having just watched his friend burn to death, went berserk, and proceeded to hack the giant goblin to death with his daggers and kept stabbing long after his opponent had perished. Arradon reached the kitchen at this time, saw his crush lying dead on the floor, drew his pistol and shot Doctor Goblin-puss. \n\nSensing the tables turning, the goblin mechanic decided to get the hell out of Dodge, making straight for the nearest wall and using the strength of his mechanical arms to make a hole large enough to admit him. Whiskey was still stabbing the giant goblin's corpse (reverted to normal goblin size upon his death), so it was left to the investigator to pursue Doc. \n\nIt turned out that as large and powerful as the arm rig might be, it wasn't exactly speedy. Arradon caught up to the goblin out in the street, and fired another shot before reaching the fleeing mechanic...who pulled the mecha-gorilla equivalent of an E-brake turn, pivoting on one giant fist while casting a spell, and using the other arm to deliver a *shocking hands* that dropped Arradon. It was about this time that Cedric poked his head out of the giant hole in the wall, and the goblin decided that finishing off Arradon wasn't worth dying for. It managed to escape into the sewers, and Cedric got a potion down Arradon's throat before he bled out. \n\nNix was clearly not getting back up, and the country they were in had a ban on resurrection magic (slippery slope to outright necromancy), but luckily Whiskey had heard rumors of a wandering druid north of town that was said to have the power to revive the dead. So after salvaging a steamer trunk from the goblin den to carry their companion's charred corpse in, they chartered a ship north, spent some time searching for the druid, and eventually Whiskey managed to get her attention.\n\nBy singing nursery rhymes in Sylvan. Hey, it worked. In the heavily industrialized corner of the world they were in, the druid hadn't heard Sylvan spoken in years. It caught her interest, and she agreed to bring back Nix...for a price. \n\nThere was a nearby town, she told them, that had once been full of people, a small and peaceful fishing village that turned to cannibalism when the snows cut them off one winter. The survivors, come spring, had been discovered and 'purged' by the local theocracy, and since then something dark and unnatural had moved in to the abandoned town. The druid promised to revive Nix in exchange for the destruction of whatever force had descended on the town. \n\nThe party agreed instantly, and the druid took Nix's body down into the river, returning an hour later with...a half-orc. \n\nReincarnation is a fickle mistress.\n\nNix, for her part, was actually pretty excited about her newfound musculature, although the tusks she could have done without. After a brief existential crisis, the party set out to figure out what was going on in the abandoned town. The walk took two days.\n\nOn a whim, as they crossed out of the forest and into the overgrown streets of the old fishing village, Nix cast *Hide from Undead*. Rounding a corner, what should they encounter but...well, the undead. A pair of orcish zombies, definitely past the sell-by date. Completely incapable of perceiving the adventurers. Cedric, impressed by Nix's magic, stepped forward to wave a hand in front of one zombie's face...and triggered an alarm in the form of a head on a pike that began screaming.\n\nAn answering roar from deep in the forest was not what the party wanted to hear, so they dispatched the zombies, as well as two orcs that emerged from the ruined buildings of the old town, before taking up positions with clear line of sight, no one more than thirty feet from the freshly-orcified cleric. They got entrenched, readied their weapons, and waited for the horde to come. \n\nAnd come it did, but not in the form they expected. A spectral raven landed on one of the fallen orcs, placed something in its ruined face, and flapped off as the orc rose to its feet, another zombie. \n\nThis hadn't been part of the plan. \n\nAs the orcs began to boil out of the forest from an unexpected direction, the raven continued to flap around the battlefield, reanimating any orcs that fell, until Nix managed to smash it with her morningstar hard enough that it practically atomized on impact. That got another roar from somewhere in the horde, and the shaman whose familiar had just been turned into paste began to push toward the front. \n\nWhiskey dropped a *grease* spell on the area they had managed to bottleneck the orcs in, and Arradon used a firebreath extract to roast several of them while they were struggling to stand up. Cedric was trying and failing to get inside their heads, and eventually resorted to setting the zombies on fire with his mind. \n\nThen the shaman reached the grease, and the half-dozen fallen orcs returned to their feet and resumed their advance on the adventurers' position. \n\nNix stepped forward, nearly within arm's reach of the shambling wall of undead orcs that was closing in, and channeled the divine power of her god. A prayer and a flash of light, and the half-dozen recently  reanimated orcs very suddenly *de*-animated. \n\nWhich is when Whiskey stepped up behind the shaman, cast *shocking grasp*, and dropped the big orc like a sack of potatoes. \n\nSurrounded by more than a dozen corpses, most killed twice, and slick with orc gore, the party unanimously voted to put the town to the torch, and consider their obligation to the druid fulfilled. Next week we'll go back to complicated plots and scheming masterminds, but this was a good old-fashioned cathartic throwdown. \n\n**Body count:** \n\n* 8 goblin rogues\n* 3 goblin rogue/fighters\n* 1 goblin bloodrager\n* 12 orc fighters\n* 8 orc zombies\n* 1 orc shaman ",

        "text": "For part 1: http://reddit.com.marqueefy.com/r/gametales/comments/2kaf7j/i_am_bardock_bard_of_rock_4e/\n\n\nLast time we saw our wayward hero, he and his companions (a warforged barbarian and tiefling warlock) had just blown a tavern clear into oblivion, accidentally killing a few dozen innocents.\n\n(The full story here\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1f1y9g/4e_a_human_bard_tiefling_warlock_and_warforged/ )\n\nWell, upon leaving the sewers, an evil mage (the main villain) says he'll ensure the gang leaves the town if we lie and say we killed the leader.\nWe had no choice but to agree. (He out-leveled us by way too much) \n\nWell, needless to say out higher ups were going to be PISSED.  However, there were no witnesses, so our tiefling has the great idea to make a \"lie serum.\"  Meaning we could lie without our minds being read for deception. However, we had to roll well and the great Bardock had to master the craft of speech.\n\nOh, our higher ups?\nA grand elder council of mages.  The most cynical member was a master mind reader.\n\nThey initially hired us to find a bandit leader terrorizing the town. We lost them and managed to really screw up.\n\nNow that the backstory is established let's get to it.\n\n\nWe walked in to the waiting room, blitzed off Evil Lie Juice, and just for a boost of confidence Bardock slammed a few flagons of Orc Mead.\n\nTiefling: \"ok Bardock, you know what to do.\"\n\nBardock: \"*HIC* of course! You red cactus bitch!\"\n\nTiefling: \"are you drunk?!\"\n\nBardcok: \"OFF YOUR MOM! *hic*!!\"\n\nThen the servant entered to bring us in the chamber.\n\n8 of the wisest ages in the land vs. the \"Always Sunny\" cast of DnD.\n\nWizard Chairman: \"you have failed your task, you lost the mark and killed several innocent people\"\n\nBardock: \"INNOCENT?! They were as innocent as an owlbear at a fish market!\"\n\nChairman: \"who the hell is this loudmouth? (Keep in mind he did not hire us himself)\"\n\nBardock: \"I AM BARDOCK! *HIC* Bard of Cock!! And my implement itches for action!\n\nChairman: \"you have 10 seconds to explain before I kill you all\"\n\nBardock: \"We killed whores and thieves! Accidentally I add. Also, we DID kill the mark. The gang disbanded.\"\n \n\nSilence.\n\n\nPsychic: \"I sense no deception. Just alcohol and stupidity.\n\nChairman: \"then, I must deem you all free to go. With EXTREME prejudice.\"\n\nBardock: \"And they say eunuchs have no compassion!\" \n\nChairman: \"we aren't eunuchs...\"\n\nBardock: \"COULD'VE FOOLED ME!\"\n\nSo were being thrown out onto our faces and we go about our way.\n\n\nOk, now here is where it gets fun again. We go to a tavern and Bardock is drinking and slapping asses... Everyone's asses. It was an unrestricted ass-slap-fest.  Until he saw an orc.\n\nThis was the first orc we'd seen the whole game.  \n\nHardcore Bardcore mode engaged.\n\nBardock approaches the orc aggressively.  The orc rises. Standing well over Bardock's head.\n\nThey stare.\n\nThe bar is silent.\n\nThe tiefling is \"oh shit\"ing under his breath.\n\nThe orc bends down to Bardocks level.\n\nLook the DM right the fuck in the eye:\n\nHeadbutt.gif\n\n\"Roll\"\n\nA sweet 15.\n\nSLAM.\n\nThe Orc reals back and howls.\nHowling continues as the color drains from the poor terrified patrons.\nHowls change... Sounds like... Laughter.\n\nHA. HA. HA.\n\nBardock: \"Pay up Ogger!\" (Do the math)\n\nBardock and this fucking mammoth orc proceed to get wasted into the night and wreck the entire bar.\n\nThe next morning we're broke due to damage costs, when a wood elf approaches us.\n\nWood Elf: \"Greetings travelers, that was some extravagant happenings last night.\"\n\nTielfing: \"That was the result of keeping company with such a vagrant as this Bard.\"\n\nWood Elf: \"I can return that money with much extra.\"\n\nCue Bardock.  Waking up from a pile of tankards and furniture.\n\nBardock: \"Awe! LOOK AT THE LITTLE MAN!\" \n\nHe reaches for a hug when ZING.\nA knife whizzes past Bardock lobbing off a lock of hair.\n\nWood Elf: \"I am a rogue in need of help, but if you try that again the next will be your eye.\"\n\nBardock: \"oohhhhh\"\n\nUnfortunately guys, our DM moved to South Africa, so this campaign never continued,  but there was one encounter worth mentioning.\n\nThe first bandit battle we had on the road.\n\nWe were approaching a crossroad where a stranger stood in the center, blocking our path.\n\nBardock: \"TRAP!\"\n\nWarforged: \"Shhhhhh\"\n\nBardock: (screaming whisper) \"TRaaaaaaaaaaaP\"\n\nWarforged: \"Clearly. Ok huddle up.\"\n\nWe circle.\n\nTielfing: \"We need a plan\"\n\nWarforged: \"I can pretend to be non-sentient, and you can perform a perception check while Bardock....\"\n\nBardock would have no puny plan. Bardock wanted action, and it was action we was about to get.\n\nBardock: Move friend! Or I will move you myself!\"\n\nBandit: \"for three gold you can pass-\"\n\nBardock: \"For three gold I could bone your mother's tang!\" \n\nBandit: \"so you want to fight-\"\n\nBardock: \"bitch!\"\n\nDM: \"Ok roll initiative, christ alive.\"\n\nAs we battled the full bandit force jumped out of the trees. They had three hounds and five men in all.\nWe Bardock's brute lute blasted some massive spells which caused one man's intestines to rupture. The Warforged axe cleaved the dogs in two with enough force to push their severed spines into the dirt.  The Tiefling lit three men on fire and they burned miserably to death.\n\n\nThen there was one. The first man. He was very bloodied and burnt.\n\nBandit: \"by the god's, *cough* what are you?\"\n\nOhshit.jpg\n\n\"I AM BARDOCK THE BARD OF ROCK, AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE CLIFFORD THE BIG RED BITCH!\"\n(I honestly don't know why I blurted that line but we meta laughed for a while)\n\nThen SLAM. The Brute Lute bashed the man's skull to bits.\n\nDM: \"Christ Bardock, you have BAGS of gold. Was three gold worth that encounter?\"\n\nBardock: \"Are you worth an encounter?\"\n\nDM: ...Ok Bardock.",

        "text": "[A continuing tale of my pathfinder character, Garaad the ditzy ninja.](http://redd.it/2mbuce) For those of you who weren't here last time, Garaad and his friends (consisting of a cheerful dwarf fighter, a dwarf barbarian with daddy issues, and a magical wizard hobo from the future) murdered their way though a large tropical jungle island and all the delightful things it contained. They rescued some comrades in a spot of bother, almost got eaten by a giant snake, happened upon a sleeping dragon and killed it for no reason, and also murdered a tree. Why were we fighting a tree...?\n\nAnyway, our party returned to their employers (a large airship building a railway across the various islands floating in the sky) to let them know the situation. Basically, it's a jungle. You can't put a railway through the jungle unless you set it on fire first.\n\nSo they did.\n\nWell, fuck that jungle anyway. Fire is much prettier than jungles. After that, we returned to our quarters while the giant airship set a course for a new destination. On the way, we were presented with a new party member- A female aasimar paladin who had apparently been the sole survivor of a TPK beforehand. She was still reeling from that one, and frankly, the management didn't trust that she was competent enough to hack it, so she was assigned to a group where she'd have as little impact as possible. Our dwarves bitched and complained about the implications of that while Garaad marveled at the mysterious glowy woman with antlers.\n\nBefore long, we were airdinghied down to our next quarry- a smallish island that was home to a village of trolls. We were supposed to diplomacize/murder them into submission so that our bosses could lay down some tracks. The trolls were actually quite reasonable, and were all set to let us work, but there was one small problem. This troll village was less warlike than others because it had a guardian to watch over them- some sort of six-headed monstrosity that would wake up whenever loud things were happening outside its cave and promptly murder everything that wasn't a troll. So building the tracks while that guy is around was kind of a no-no. Or, that's what the fighter dwarf said- Garaad was trying to imagine what it would be like to have six heads.\n\nAnyway, the jist of it was that we could murder the giant monster troll so long as we provided some other means of protection to the village. We haggled for a while, and offered some of our giant airship's golems- it had a huge supply of small humanoid ones, and a few leviathans on board, to boot. The trolls figured that was about as good a deal as we could get, so we called that in to our superiors while requisitioning some heavy firepower- this troll bastard was, like, ten levels higher than us and one of those special flying [clockwork leviathans](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/clockwork/clockwork-leviathan) might be nice.\n\nProblem: Nobody in the group knows how to pilot a giant flying clockwork snake.\nSolution: Put the guys with the highest Knowledge: Engineering in it and hope for the best.\n\nGaraad and the hobo wizard were going to be used as bait- we were to go into the cave, piss off the supertroll, and lure it outside so that it could have a super smackdown with our giant mechanical crime against the laws of physics. It was a solid plan, because Garaad had taken a feat that would let him dimension door through shadows, and some supplemental ones that would allow him to do it as a move action. He kept the troll's attention, all right- in the shadowy cave, he was infuriatingly hard to hit, and he was burning ki points like crazy while launching an absurd number of attacks at the supertroll's heads, and half of them were either crits or sneak attacks. All of this was happening while the hobo wizard pelted the troll with magic missiles and fireballs. The troll had poor aim, large arms, and was not particularly intelligent- it was a bit like watching the schoolyard bully being harassed by a swam of bees while all the other kids chanted \"Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself!\"\n\nFinally, though, the troll emerged into the sunlight, missing a few superfluous brains and about twenty gallons of blood. Our crew in the clockwork leviathan sprang into action, employing their prodigious +3 knowledge of machines to send the massive snake flying towards the troll... and then up into the air... and then through a few nauseating sommersaults... and then straight into the ground at about mach 1.\n\nFortunately, the resulting explosion killed the troll, but not any of the passengers (something about seat belts?). We were cautious enough to set the corpse on fire before it decided not to stay dead, but now we had a really big problem on our hands- that goddamn leviathan cost, like, five year's pay. While the dwarves were squabbling about whose fault this was and the paladin was facepalming so hard that she was leaving a permanent handprint on her helmet, Garaad voiced a simple question. \"Can you put it back together?\"\n\nWhat followed was a surpisingly good repair job, all things considered- we picked up all the pieces, stuffed them somewhere inside the giant bastard, and then put all the outside-bits back into their proper places. It was a bit like performing taxidermy- it might have looked hale and hearty, but all of the important inside-bits looked like they'd run afoul of an angry kraken, a red dragon and a tarrasque. Well, maybe our superiors wouldn't notice, right?\n\nBefore we faced that particular issue, we headed back to the troll village to check up on those guys. I mean, we'd just killed what was practically their god, we wanted to make sure they didn't get screwed over by the higher-ups. What we found was a town filled with clockwork golems and burning troll corpses. While just about everyone tried to remove their jaws from the floor, Garaad did a little bit of scout work- he found that the golems had, indeed, been sent to murder the trolls, and what's more, they were explicitly sent from our employer's airship.\n\nGod dammit.\n\nWe briefly debated disabling the golems and saving what trolls we could, but this was fruitless- Garaad was tired, and couldn't sneak attack these things worth a damn, nor could he disable them. Plus, as far as we could see, all of the trolls were already dead. Maybe we'd spent a bit too much time patching our ridiculously expensive failure with the structural equivalent of band-aids. So instead, we trudged back to the airdinghy with sunken spirits (except Garaad, who didn't really get why everyone else was so bummed) and went back to the giant airship.\n\nWhat followed was just about the screamiest shouting match that Garaad had ever witnessed. Our superiors called us violently incompetent (only half true!) and bitched at us for the destruction of the leviathan- which, by the way, was coming out of our pay. Our barbarian dwarf argued that we had repaired it reasonably well and saved about half of the repair costs, but there were bigger issues on the party's mind, like how our commander had promised a guard detail to the trolls and instead gave them genocide. Our commander said that he had promised \"a clockwork army\", but hadn't said what it would be doing. Pretty much everyone thought this was bullshit.\n\nThe screaming match continued until the wizard intervened and tried to get the commander to calm down, resting a friendly hand on the angry officer's shoulder- a hand which, while not threatening, contained one [touch of idiocy](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/touch-of-idiocy). With that, our commander forgot how to speak, shouted \"DURR\" at us a few times, and then shat himself. While he was busy with that, the party unanimously decided it was time to leave.\n\nWe were a LONG way from our home continent, though. Getting out of this mess wasn't as simple as turning in your two week's notice, and given what we had seen them do to guys who were just in the way, we didn't want to find out what happened to ex-employees who had technically assaulted an officer. We decided to bustle as convincingly as possible to the captain's cabin, where there was a teleporation gate. The gate ate a lot of power and was hard to calibrate, so it was off-limits to most of the crew- thankfully, all you need in order to convince people you're where you're supposed to be is look pissed off and march straight forward. That was easy, most everyone was pretty angry already. Garaad had trouble with the walking straight forward part, though- he kept winding up in weird places, like parellel corridors, on the opposite side of walls, and at one point in the ventilation system. And he just couldn't keep an angry face...\n\nWe got to the captain's cabin easy enough, but no amount of angry bustle lets you in there- so instead, we knocked. A man answered, we explained we were there to use the teleporter, and the man told us that he was the captain and there was to be none of that. Our paladin pointed out that the real captain would probably not be an eighty-year-old human in a janitor's uniform. The old guy tried to play the pity card to get us to stick around and chat with him, but time was short, and we needed to be gone YESTERDAY, so the party barged through and straight into the teleporter room. Calibration was tricky, but our wizard *seemed* confident he'd got it pointing to the right place, so we said \"what the hell\" and jumped in.\n\nBut, yanno, you have to be careful saying things like that around a teleporter that slingshots you through different planes of existence...\n\nNEXT TIME ON \"Paved with good intentions\", WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER AND INAPPROPRIATE PALADIN CONDUCT!",

By this point Bodyguard Daddy was a level 8 barbarian who hit like a truck, and Princess Ivy was a Bard 4 / Ninja 4 with almost too many options in combat.  (I've seen older players get \"decision paralysis\" with less on their plates than she had, so she did quite well all things considered.)\n\nSo, into the castle we bravely stride and that's when she dropped the bombshell: the Lich we were about to face was, in fact, her dead grandfather come back to life.   Morbid, but cool.  I roll with it.\n\nThe Lich awaits us in the old throne room, surrounded by all our old favourites from the past -- skeleton archers, zombies, and ghosts.  And the fight is on!\n\nBodyguard Daddy gets his rage on and starts using his ground-pounding rage ability to topple the baddies to the ground, while Princess Ivy starts a bard song to help us fight better.  The Lich tags us both with a scorching ray, but we're made of hardy stuff.\n\nIn short order Bodyguard Daddy has taken out the minions, while Princess Ivy is trading blows with the Lich himself.  The Lich is not having much luck getting spells off with Princess Ivy harrying him so, and having Bodyguard Daddy land a few good blows brings the epic fight to its conclusion.\n\nPrincess Ivy is a little sad that her grandfather got turned evil, but happy to get her castle back.  We spent the rest of the session drawing the castle and redecorating the ruins.  \n\n**FIN**\n\nP.S.  After a long break, we started a new 5e campaign, which I will endeavour to chronicle here when I get the chance.",

        "text": "Out of everyone I've ever had the pleasure of playing with as DM, there's one friend who I have always tried to emulate with my DMing style. He's not as big on the number crunch of the game, and wants to make our experience as heroic and fantastic as possible. To that end, one thing he does is throw out any kind of standard magic item in the game world. In his mind, a magic item is mad by a wizard who is either bat shit insane or wants to see how far he can push a theory.\n\nSo we never got +1 weapons or anything like that. Instead, I once picked up a hatchet that, when thrown, would always bounce between three targets before returning to the wielder. Now, if it was just me and two other guys in the room, you can guess who the third target would be. But my favorite item to date was the Toy Boat.\n\nAt its most basic concept, the Toy Boat is similar to the Folding Boat. They're both relatively small and expand into a full sized watercraft at the application of a trigger. That's where their similarities end however. The Toy Boat is, as expected, a miniature rowboat carved out of wood, with intricate little details like oars and even a little removable mast lashed to the side. Really a well made replica more than a toy. And instead of a command word, the boat grows to its full 12' length when it gets wet. Drop it in water, it grows. It gets rained on, it grows. You fall in the river with it in your knapsack, you get the idea. And the only way for the boat to shrink back down to pocket size is for it to completely dry out.\n\nAt one point we were trying to defend a town from a giant that was snatching up and eating the citizens. We had barricaded everyone in a central building and were defending it with the town militia, but we were getting slaughtered. Interestingly, wooden weapons seemed to do the most damage to the thing, so many of us had dropped our swords and picked up clubs and broken fence posts to attack.\n\nAs the last militiaman got swallowed whole, we all knew that we were next. Our party's Wizard got a flash of insight and looked at me. *\"Toy Boat\"* were his only words. It took me a second but I understood what he meant. Fishing the thing out of its waterproof pouch, I told the DM that I wanted to hold my action until the giant picked me up and opened its mouth to eat me.\n\nThen I start taunting it. Talking is a free action after all. The Monk and the Ranger don't get what's going to happen, but the DM does, and he just grins. He describes the beast picking me up, cracking a couple of ribs in the process. And as he explains how it opens its mouth wide to bite me in half, I dramatically toss an almond from our trail mix bowl at him, and say that I throw the Toy Boat into the giant's mouth.\n\nThe almond missed, bouncing off of the DM's chin, but the Toy Boat did not. The Monk and Ranger's expressions changed as our DM explained that everyone who could see the giant saw gore as splintered wood, broken oars, and blood soaked sail cloth erupted from the giant's head and throat. The big lunk teetered around for a minute, and came crashing down dead.\n\nWe managed to save one or two of the dozen militiamen, but they were pretty scarred from being in the thing's stomach. I was on bed rest for quite a while, and had to pull in an alt character to keep playing while my main guy recovered. And unfortunately, we never found another Toy Boat. But, to this day, that thing is still my favorite magic item.",

        "text": "One of the most memorable things I've ever done as a DM to get a party to hate the big bad was forcing the PCs to kill one of their allies.\n\nThe setting wasn't that unique - the leader of a city was trying to sacrifice everyone in it in one big ritual in order to force open a gate to the Far Realm, because there weren't nearly enough tentacle monsters already there for his liking. The PCs had met another group of NPC adventurers who were working towards similar goals, and so they teamed up - the NPC fighter ended up in the group (because they really needed a second tank, the poor Swordmage was new and...terrible), while the cleric / wizard tended to the party's base and the rogue scouted around the city, trying to find them information.\n\nNow, it wasn't unusual for the rogue to disappear for sessions on end, and then show back up unexpectedly. He smiled all the time, was incredibly likeable, and not one person in the group had anything bad to say about him. So when he vanished for an extended period a little over halfway into the campaign, nobody really thought much of it.\n\nSkip to almost the very end of the campaign, where the party is investigating the big bad's former mansion. They unlock a door and emerge into a room that is the stereotypical evil wizard lair - potions bubbling and frothing on tables, murder implements hanging from the ceiling, evil magic circle drawn in blood on the floor. And, as expected, lying in the middle of the floor was the body of this poor gnome rogue that the party liked so much.\n\nNaturally, they rushed up to see if he was alive and if there was anything they could do to save him. At which point, the gnome rogue, who was magically invisible, moved up behind the wizard and shanked him almost from full health to unconsciousness. The players were shocked up until the point where the body they’d been inspecting exploded, dealing a bunch of damage to the party, at which point they realized that their friend had been wholly corrupted by the same force that had grabbed the leader of the city and turned him into the big bad.\n\nNow, I had shown the stats and powers of the gnome rogue to a friend who also DMed before I threw him at my party, just to see what his reaction was. The gnome had an ability that would allow him, every so often, to drop a clone when struck, go magically invisible, and have the clone take the attack, and then after a few seconds, the clone would explode, dealing damage to anyone nearby. The rogue also did ridiculous damage when he had advantage against his target, and knew the party well enough to know who he needed to focus his attacks on in order to cripple them the most. My friend looked at the sheet for about five minutes, and then looked up at me and asked me just how much I hated my players.\n\nThe fight lasted for an hour and a half in the real-world, and I had never seen the PCs take a fight so seriously and somberly. It was clear that they were upset at me and taking the fight seriously, but there was almost a depressing gloom hanging over the entire table. At the end of the fight, the NPC fighter, who was also best friends with the rogue, and had been for almost his entire life, rolled a crit. At which point, I told the party that the fighter walked up to his friend, who was battered, bruised, and had a look of pure malice in his eyes, raised his hammer, and crushed his friend’s skull. At which point he turned, walked out of the room, and collapsed against the wall in the hallway.\nI don’t think any of the PCs said a word for a good two minutes after that. It was just silence at the table, with everyone looking at me, waiting for me to say…something. Anything. I just sat there, staring down at my notes, shuffling papers around and fiddling with dice, before telling them that the session was over.\n\nI’m still not sure they’ve fully forgiven me for it. Truthfully, I’m not sure I’ve fully forgiven myself for it, either.",

        "text": "I'm running a campaign with friends where all their PCs were orphans in the same orphanage during their youth. Later on they reunite and we begin the campaign, but this week we were supposed to start and two players were busy, so I ended up running a prequel session, which was not anything I prepared.\n\n**The System:** Savage Worlds\n\n**The setting:** Dodushkun, the City of Isles. On the coast of Lake Dannr, and the seat of power in the kingdom in all but name only, it's a huge city marked by structures left behind by whatever race inhabited the planet originally. Technology is equivalent to late 1700s, with guns being wide-spread, magic regularly studied but rare, and the feudal system drying up.\n\n**The player characters:**\n\nSaldo: The dashing, somewhat dumb kid, he's the youngest of the group at nine years old. Enjoys wrestling, and not much else.\n\nGorvis: A caster, he'd been on the streets for a year or so before getting caught breaking a minor law and getting entangled in the system. Used to living on his own. He's the oldest, at eleven.\n\nIngevla: The cousin-of-a-cousin of an aristocratic family, her parents died and she was put into the system instead of being put up with. Pragmatic in the extreme, and always willing to use her Imperial Citizen status and natural charm to get her way. She's the middle orphan, at a new ten.\n\n**The Non-Player Characters:**\n\nMother Alvra: Young, pretty, and head of Mother Alvra's Home for Wayward Souls, she has recently purchased three orphans from the church for an unknown purpose. She seems well-liked by the people in the district, and is always treated with more respect than normally afforded people of her age.\n\nWe start with the orphans arriving at their new home. Mother Alvra gives them a [short tour](http://imgur.com/frivPJ9) of the orphanage before leaving them on their own with instructions to not burn down the (stone) building. After hearing her joke fall flat, she leaves on errands, saying she'll be back within the hour.\n\nLeft to their own devices, the orphans are a little unsure of what to do. After getting some short introductions out of the way, Gorvis asks Ingevla for a few of her hair-pins, which she surrenders because he's bigger than her. He immediately makes his way through the building and then wanders over to Mother Alvra's chamber door and tries picking the lock.\n\nIngevla shrugs, changes into her sleep clothes, and tries to take a nap.\n\nWhile Gorvis is trying to pick the lock, several other orphans enter the building, though some cursory glances reveal that they obviously don't live there. The newcomers show confusion at someone else being there, and say they didn't know someone was already trying at the joint that day. After managing to convince the newcomers that yes, it was indeed Gorvis's turn to steal from the orphanage that day, they leave the three PCs a marking to follow if they want to know what the business is.\n\nGorvis goes back to trying to break the lock. Saldo, apparently still unsure of his new lot in life, sans-parents, stands around and eventually gravitates, naturally, towards the older boy.\n\nGorvis picks Alvra's lock and steals five marcs from her desk drawer. Saldo, feeling the stirrings of what might grow into that ever-elusive conscience, tells him to put it back. Gorvis, unimpressed, tries to push past.\n\nSaldo isn't taking that shit. He successfully grapples the older boy in a headlock.\n\nHearing the commotion, Inge rises from her bed and goes to see what's up. Seeing the two older boys beating each other up, she begins to hit herself on the arm enough to bruise herself. After a few hits the absurdity of the situation sinks in, and Inge sinks to the ground, sobbing.\n\nMeanwhile, Gorvis has managed to get himself untangled from Saldo's grapple. In an attempt to get the boy out of the way, he lashes out with his magic in an icy burst along the ground, through the mistress's doorway.\n\nSaldo sees the motions and dodges to the side, leaving the sitting, sobbing, and bruised Ingevla directly in their path. The ice pierces her and she immediately starts bleeding onto the stone floor.\n\n\"Oh *fuck*,\" was stated, both in- and out-of-game, as Gorvis realizes that he almost killed Ingevla...just as Mother Alvra returns.\n\nAlvra drops her things and rushes over, pushing the two boys out of the way. She manages to get Ingevla fixed up, who immediately begins sobbing. Alvra calls her on her bullshit and gathers the kids at one of the tables, after shooting them a knowing look after noticing her door is unlocked. She tells them she'll get them targets for their...aggressions, and makes them clean up the ice and blood.\n\nThat's when we called it done for the night. Next week we'll be doing another kid-prequel with the other two PCs as new orphans, and it'll be about six months in-game after this...event.",

        "text": "Is to have him take something away from the players. Could be physical, or just their pride. I don't know how common that knowledge is, but I know spoony touched upon it once. Last night I got to see that principle in action for the first time. I must say, it was glorious. \n\nI had this villain I really wanted the player characters to hate. They were a group of adventurers in a magical fantasy setting traveling to a mysterious island, magically risen from the sea in search of treasure, and on the way to the bustling boomtown on the shores, they have to battle a kill a group of Kobold Pirates lead by a young, overzealous dragon already wounded form harpoons and cannon fire. The players bring him down, impressively enough, by using the hunter's hardcore bear tranquilizers and the deck ballista. They are greeted in town as heroes, but that lasts about two minutes but who should strut in but my villain.\n\nHe was the ornately dressed pompous head of a holy order of knights who worship a cruel god of war, and who were charged with upholding \"order\" in this town. He constantly barked lurid threats and self-aggrandizing boasting at whoever happened to be nearby, which I voiced by doing my best Cobra Commander impression. He came with about forty of his lackeys so they could not hope to fight him here, and he proceeds to seize the dragon carcass as \"contraband,\" and insult to injury, Picked up the lovable-scumbag sea captain who took them to the island by the throat and tossed him into the harbor. One of them even sidled right up to one of the group's two fighters and tore a dragon claw right out of her hand.\n\nNow, I wanted to get the players hyped up for killing this guy, but the reaction I got exceeded all expectations. They immediately began fuming with rage and hurling expletives, and, fortunately, they were all directed at the character and not me or my co-DM. We were on Roll-20, they immediately began drawing this guy in the whiteboard as a literal caricature of Adolf Hitler dressed in armor with a few vulgar features added in. They were shaking their fists at this guy all the way to the inn, even though most of the players were able to conceal all the dragon parts they had looted, with the exception of the fighter's claw. One of them stealthily tried to use some smoke magic as a petty gesture of revenge, and they beat up some random guy for it. I was touched that they were pretty quick to help the poor soul to a healing priest.\n\nTo reward them for being smart enough not to rush this guy's entire regiment out in the open like some players would, my partner and I decided to favor them with a chance encounter with a few members of this guy's order in a dark alley with no witnesses, and also just happened to have them start harassing the parties vehemently anti-authoritarian bard/swashbuckler and his vehemently anti-corruption partner, the female fighter who got her tooth stolen, in an homage to the \"pick up that can!\" sequence from Half Life 2. The Swashbucker responded by showing his rapier through a gap in the guy's faceplate. The group immediately named him \"scarface\" and the Swashbucker planned to leave him alive and mutilated as a warning. The rest of the party failed to oblige him, and killed him.\n\nThe whole sequence was glorious, the way they latched onto hating these Heels with such earnest white hot passion. When our mysterious old tavern questgiver came around to offer them a treasure map in exchange for murdering one of this outfit's officers, there was no hesitation. The swashbucker even started drawing up a campaign hit list, starting with these guys. I think this is going to be a great campaign, and it just goes to show that the best way to get player characters invested in a game is often to make things personal however you can. It helps that we have smart and creative players with good character concepts.\n\nI just wanted to share because it was such a powerful roleplaying experience, and it's that exact sort of moments that make me love DMing, and that make me feel like I've created a story that my players are truly connected to, and want to participate in. That's why I call it \"soft railroading,\" I haven't forced them onto the rails, i just made the rails worth riding. Also, there will be some free exploration segments later as well. I'll admit, it's not the most complex story (at least with regard to this faction of enemies, the complex part comes later), but the feelings were so real. I love it!",

        "text": "This is a Call of Cthulhu one shot I ran a few weeks back for Halloween. A lot of the spells and beasts I made up solely for this session.\n\nFirst some setup. I had told my players they would all be playing a character with Hollywood amnesia. To really play off this affect I generated 9 characters for 5 players and gave each player a description of the character physically, and the character's first name. Each character had a starting item the players could choose to hide from the party. The ones chosen:\n\nMarcus Bloc (M.) - a tall and strongly built African American man. Very well dressed. Started with a wedding ring.\n\nTwilly Lions (M.) - sheepish and small of frame. Well dressed. Started with a white queen from a chess board.\n\nCaroline Moore (F.) - Black hair with a black dress to match. Started with lock-picking tools.\n\nSarrin Black (F.) - Pale, blonde, with fair skin and a white dress. Started with a rune engraved knife.\n\nCharles Hindon (M.) - Tall, pale, and greasy. Wearing an old worn suit. Started with a needle and a bottle of chloroform.\n\nWhenever a player attempted a roll I would tell them a general idea of how good they were at a skill if they succeeded. In addition throughout the level there were several artifacts of each players old life, and upon finding one the player would have a flashback where I would hand them a note card telling them a little about their back story and 1-2 skills they have.\n\nSo on to the tale!\n\nIt was a dark room and with a cold cement floor that they first awoke in. Above them a single light hung from the ceiling revealing their faces to one another. On the floor was a radio playing \"Sunshine, Lollipops, and Rainbows\" slowly being dragged out the only door into a dark hallway. After a brief introduction the party decides to follow the music. They come to a T intersection. To the left two doors, one slightly ajar revealing a comforting orange glow and the music. The other shut tight with a bright white light coming from the crack beneath it. To the right a turn in the hall bathed in moonlight. Here Marcus argues going right, while Sarrin, Caroline, and Charles argue going left. Twilly holds his tongue.\n\nThe party agrees to split. Twilly and Marcus go right to find a small dining room before a balcony. Outside they see a small forest path leading away from the cliff top manor they find themselves in. Past the forest a small modern town resting in the night. The other three chose to investigate the shut door. With a little handiwork from Caroline's lock picks the manage to get the door to open, triggering a small bell and rope alarm. A few moments of silence and the decide it is safe to go in. The find a police flash light laying in the center, and in the back corner on a small shelf a mason jar filled with human teeth. It is here Charles has his first flashback. He sees himself before an unconscious patient, trying to pull a tooth.\n\nSoon the party reunites in the room with an orange glow, finding a small lounge with a fireplace, chess set, several book cases, a stuffed bear head mounted above the mantle, and two other doors leading out: and ivory one and an ebony one.\n\nThey each take their time with the room, investigating various portions. Marcus finds an American NFL football among the books, and recalls himself playing the sport in a stadium filled with people. Caroline finds a small needle laying in a corner. She recalls a hospital safe containing medicine with her attempting to break in. Finally Twilly looks in the bears mouth and sees a small gold medal, with a familiar symbol on it. He picks it up and recalls a special function held for disable children with much of the funding provided by him. It is a warm memory, but short lived as outside in the hallway the came from a noise emanates.\nThey check out the door and see a large bear with several patches of fur missing, its muzzle caked in dried blood, and its one eye glowing with a red hate. A monstrous roar later and the beast is charging. Quickly they shut and bar the door, hoping to buy time. Caroline rushes over to the ivory door, working hastily to unlock it. Marcus stands stays close to the beast, slowly breaking through the makeshift barricade, and tries to beat it back with a firepoker. As the bear is nearly in the room Caroline hears a \"click\" and the door swings open revealing a staircase down. Without hesitation they descend leaving the bear roaring at the top, but not following.\n\nThey find themselves in a modern kitchen now, with all the amenities that includes. Feeling safer they again take time to investigate before moving on. Charles checks on a pot of stew still cooking on a slow burner. He finds a human femur swirling with the meat, and recalls another memory. He is working with a patient, amputating the leg, and sowing up much more grievous wounds. When he comes to the femur is gone, revealing just a stew.\n\nSarrin finds a small duty notebook and begins reading. Its a journal, hers to be precise, and inside are hymns and charms. She recalls a chapel, singing, and prayers. In the center a man, sweating and shaking with a painful expression carved into his face. The singing stops and their is a bright light, and then a black mist pours from the man and seeps into the ground. Their is cheering. She remembers a spell she knew, exorcism.\nTwilly finds a photo of himself, only much younger, with his parents at his side. He sees a funeral. His parents being lowered six feet under, and a talk with an attorney about an inheritance.\n\nWhile the rest search Marcus heads for the swinging doors out of the kitchen after finding a Superbowl ring with his number on it. He sees a pale face staring through the window at them all and gives chase following the strange man through twisting hallways. The rest of the party follow, but stand no chance at keeping up with the NFL star.\n\nMarcus chases the strange man through one last door, his only drive now is for answers. He stumbles through and finds himself in darkness. Before him a woman, beaten and bloodied. She is begging for him to stop, but carries a wicked almost knowing smile while doing it. The party finds him standing alone in a small bar clutching his ears, pleading for someone to stop.\n\nWith the man long gone they decide to search this next room as well. The more they search the more the learn about themselves, and the more the truth about their present situation becomes clear. Sarrin was an exorcist for a small coven of \"white\" witches. She had a younger sister, Sarah. Caroline finds a small pistol, and recalls her robbery of the hospital once more, only this time she sees the nurse with a bullet through her head lying next to the safe. And Charles finds a police report about a hospitals head surgeon. She was found dead, and dismembered. He recalls being in her home one night alone.\n\nTwilly, still silent, finds another photo in back, this time of he and Sarrin as children. He remembers a dark and stormy night. They where hiding from his parents, both of whom were covered in blood, their eyes gone black as shadow. They whispered for the children, calling for them to come out. They had found him, and were laughing as they raised their knifes high. When suddenly their was a flash of light and his parents dropped dead before him. Behind them stood Sarrin, and old dusty tome in her hands.\n\nWith the manor taking its toll the party decides to rest their feet at the bar for a time, enjoying the well stocked liquor it provides. All feel calmed by its effects. All but Marcus who reels from its taste. He sees himself in the past once more alone and drinking. Then he is driving. There is a loud THUD and everything goes black. When he comes to their is a small girl on a stretcher being brought into an ambulance. Emergency lights surround him. He spits the drink out and falls from his chair. In a fit of panic Marcus flees the bar, running deeper into the manor. Everyone else, confused and worried, give chase. Caroline, in her haste leaves her pistol behind, and Charles picks it up. As they run through the twisting dark halls of this floor memories flood their senses.\n\nSarrin sees her sister, lying bruised, battered, and dying in a hospital bed. The staff is too small to help her. The lead surgeon has been dead for a week, and the hospital barely has enough money to keep the lights on. She dies, and the man who hit her walks. She is reading an old tome bound in human flesh kept with all the other ancient evils her coven has locked away over the years. She remember the spells bait human, bind soul, and Summon Yu'Sothi the Great Hunter. A demon that takes the form of a great predatory bear.\nCaroline recalls a stormy night as she buries the corpse. Hiding all evidence of the murder.\n\nTwilly sees himself sign a paper. He is cutting funding from the hospital. Apparently a doctor had been stealing medicine for weeks, and had recently stole off with all of it.\n\nCharles sees himself working the fryer at McDonald's. When he leaves he doesn't go home, but to another house. A surgeon. A perfect victim. Much better than the last one.\n\nAnd Marcus. Marcus sees divorce papers and accusations. He sees himself coming home to find his wife naked and bruised. In front of her is another man. They accuse him of hurting her. Then he sees himself at a cemetery in front a small grave. \"Sarah Black.\"\n\nAnd the party finds themselves at a new staircase leading down to a furnace room lined with coal stoves. At the far end a door shut tight. Sarrin takes the back of the party while everyone descends. At the bottom she takes the party in one last time. Speaking strange words long forgotten she casts her first spell, Summon Yu'Sothi. The party is shocked and begin to run. All but Charles, who gives into his fate with one reassuring thought: \"At least I get to take these people with me,\"\n\nCharles opens fire at the fleeing party, hitting one Twilly in the shoulder and Marcus in the back. Shortly after the great bear descends on him, shredding him within an inch of his life. Caroline reaches the door with impossible speed, and tries to pull it open, but the handle is too hot, and the door to heavy. Marcus, wounded but still pushing grabs Twilly and runs as fast as his legs will take him. At this point the white queen is glowing faintly in Twilly's hand.\n\nSarrin removes her dagger and casts Bind soul on Charles, sucking his soul into one of the runes on the dagger. The bear looks down the hall and charges with a fearsome roar. With the help of Marcus the three manange to get the door cracked enough so that one may slip through. Caroline forces her way out, shoving the wounded Twilly out of the way. With the bear almost upon them their is no time for either of the other two to slip through.\n\nThen Marcus sighs, and turns to the bear and charges punching the beast in its bloody jaw. Sarrin casts bind soul once more, this time on Twilly, and with a bright flash the spell is canceled. The white queen disappears from Twilly's hand. The bear smacks Marcus aside like a toy, and rips him in two. Twilly takes one last look at the hell that has been his home for the night and slips out the door closing it behind him.\n\nOutside it is a crisp fall morning. His car sits in the manor driveway and can see Caroline already driving away in her own. Slowly he descends the steps with a sense that he is safe now. That hell is in the manor, and it cannot come out. He drives away silent.",

        "text": "I'm actually posting using the correct account this time &gt;.&lt;\n\nAfter my initial escapades with Bruce, I didn't get to play for a year or so for any great length of time. I was working at Walmart at the time, and my girlfriend at the time (now wife) told me some people at work were thinking of starting a group. \n\nOnly one of the 6 people who were interested had DM experience, so we let him choose the version, and he chose 2nd edition, being more 'old school' than the rest of us. I started with a bard (separate tale entirely). He met his unfortunate end in Caligula's hot tub (again, separate tale) and I needed to roll up a new character. \n\nI had been perusing the Tome of Magic and saw the Wild Surge chart. It utterly amazed me, and I decided to play it. When thinking of what character to play, that relied entirely on random chance, I thought what better than to make a halfling wizard named Bruce.\n\nAnd now the game:\n------------------------\nAfter dispatching the crazed Roman emperor, the party found he had prisoners, of which was a small halfling wizard (properly leveled to match the level of the party mind you). The party now consisted of a Ninja (Menschi), a cleric named \"Runefaust\", a fighter (Sarahi), and a rogue (Niko).\n\nThis party, encountering this halfling wizard, didn't think \"Hey, potentially ally!\" No, they thought, \"Hey, this guy is so small, we can tie a rope to him and throw him through doors to set off traps / lure monsters!\" Yes, that's exactly what they did. The tied a rope around him and threw him in to rooms, if he set off a trap, the cleric would just heal him. Eventually he was thrown into a room that had a lot of enemies. \n\nOne might expect to run screaming out of the room at that point and yell for the rest of the party. Not Bruce. Bruce is fearless. Having once slain an elder red dragon single handedly and all that. But, bruce being not so bright, decides that casting a spell is a great idea (remember last incarnation? [The epic tale of Bruce the Halfling Part 1!](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2jj1ru/dd_35e_the_epic_tale_of_bruce_the_halfling_part_1/)\n\nWell, this incarnation of Bruce? Oh, the spells hit, and they were amazing. Bruce lets loose a fireball on the large cluster of enemies across the room (I think they were orcs). Very first roll: Wild surge. In addition to the fireball(which did a good amount of damage), I rolled a 70 on the wild surge chart. 1000 lbs. of non-living matter within 10' of the target vanishes. The armor and weapons the orcs were wearing vanished. The floor beneath them sunk in and we had a bunch of unarmed, burning, practically naked orcs trapped in a smoldering pit in the stone floor (this may have been more than 1000 lbs, but the DM didn't care cause he thought it was funny). Bruce turns to the rest of the party and says 'this room's clear!' The party walks into the room and sees the pit of orcs, looks back at bruce, internally say, 'oh shit' and untie him. They never threw him through a door again saying 'We do NOT want to get on this guy's bad side...\n\nSkipping forward a bit (this was a looong campaign, and i can only do highlights). We were fighting, you guessed it, a red dragon. By this point, Bruce realized his magic was pretty kickass and has not touched his crossbow. The ninja, as she was want to do, always performed some death defying feat before attacking. She decided for some reason that she wants to use her rope to try to wrestle the dragon. She gets it around his neck and manages to pull its head down and holds it steady, making it vulnerable to attack. Bruce didn't really care though, it didn't affect his spells, so he just hurled another magic ball of death. I don't exactly remember the spell, I know it wasn't his go-to fireball cause it was a fire dragon, but regardless, he crit. The dragon died... and fell on top of the ninja. My wife still has a grudge til this day cause she loved that character. The dragon had, in its horde, a magic lamp.. Uh oh, the party thought. This could be either good or bad, as this DM definitely likes twisting wishes. They decided that since I slayed the dragon, I should get the wish. The session ended then, so I had an entire week to think out how to word my wish. I would sit in the middle of my class at college writing up a practical essay trying to cover my own ass while getting what I wanted from the wish.\n\nBasically what it came down to, was I wished in this long convoluted way, was to have ALL the spells. Like, I could just flip open to any page in the tome of magic or players handbook and cast it. Unlimited.\n\nLo and behold, the DM let me do it. But with one twist: Every time I cast a spell, I wild surged.\n\nNeedless to say, from this point on things got messed up.\n\nDoor in the way? Passwall around it. Need to resupply at town? Dimension door there and back again. Lots of monsters in our way? Vortex (my favorite spell, that would wild surge every time it hit a monster, and had a big aoe that stuck around as long as I could concentrate). Either that, or meteor storm.\n\nI remember one time I used vortex on a group of mobs. It opened a pit, summoned plant growth, Bruce sprayed gems from his fingertips into the pit, music filled the air, and oh, all the monsters died.\n\nIf we needed to rest, Bruce would summon Mage's Magnificent mansion (think the tardis, its bigger on the inside) and inside would cast unseen servant to bring the party food and water.\n\nBruce has two fatal flaws that led to his eventual downfall. One, his god complex, and two, his love for food.\n\nOne day, Bruce happened across some mushrooms. Being particularly hungry at this point in time (he was always hungry), the mushrooms sounded really good and he ate some... They weren't the good kind of mushrooms. Suddenly Bruce was wild surging left and right at random (in the form of hiccups). He went into town to get some help and was ambushed by some bandits when he was almost there. Bruce ran past the bandits wild surging as he ran . He arrived in the town (a town he's been in multiple times) and started banging on the door of the magic shop (the owner of which could be considered his friend by this point).\n\nBruce hiccuped. It should be mentioned that in the session before, Bruce stumbled across a ring that gave him  ALL the the metamagic feats, automatically. All spell effects were doubled. Aoe size, range, duration. Well, the wild surge that  came out of this hiccup was plant growth.  The bandits became massively confused as the Town suddenly turned into a jungle. He hiccuped again and a giant boulder appeared over the magic shop and crushed it. The magic shop owner barely survived. The townsfolk had gathered in the streets wondering what the heck happenend to their town and were witness to Bruce crushing the magic shop, so they chased him out of town.\n\nThe mushrooms eventually wore off, and the party made their way to what was Bruce's final dungeon.\n\nAt some point I decided it would be a smart idea to cast a buff on myself. I honestly don't remember what buff, or what exactly we were doing at that point, but all I know is I rolled a 72. Target turns to stone. It being self cast, Bruce turned to stone. The party tried to do their best to revive him, but only exceeded in somehow melting the statue. They then carried around his liquidated corpse in a flask and took to calling it Bruce juice.\n\nSo ends the 2nd incarnation of Bruce.",

        "text": "[A continuing tale of my pathfinder character, Garaad the ditzy ninja.](http://redd.it/2m98z0) For those of you who weren't here last time, Garaad and his two dwarf pals (one was a fighter, and the other a barbarian) had just burned a town of religious assholes to the ground. They then returned to their employer's airship, which was in charge of laying down a sky-railway, to report that the area was now most definitely secure and ready for construction.\n\nOur superiors were quite pleased with us, and we were assigned to do something similar to the next stop on our fancy fantasy road trip- a massive jungle island. Apparently they had already sent down a group, but they hadn't heard from them and they were presumed murdered by all the lovely things hiding in the bushes. Oh, and we were getting a cleric!\n\nWe all made friends on the airdinghy ride down and resolved to track down the previous group as soon as possible. Our barbarian dwarf was still grouchy, our fighter dwarf was still cheery, and the cleric seemed kind of naive and quiet- his talking skull friend, though, was anything but. Several lewd remarks later, a panicked cleric had to physically restrain our fighter dwarf from smashing the lecherous little bastard into bone fragments. Garaad did not have an opinion, because he had somehow made his way onto the bottom of the vessel, clinging to a support beam and marveling at all the pretty clouds below us.\n\nWhen we arrived, we found that the jungle was indeed filled with lovely beasties. We had a spot of trouble with an enormous python that ate our fighter and nearly killed Garaad, but our raging barbarian sorted that out for us. After that, we found a small settlement of swampy giantish dudes who were cooking up some giblet gumbo- specifically, giblets of the other advance team. While the team quietly bickered about charging in, Garaad snuck up to the one remaining captive and [shadow walked](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/shadow-walk) him to safety. +3 perception ain't got nothin' on a fetchling in the shady woods with 20 ranks in stealth.\n\nThe former captive, a halfling wizard clad in only a barrel, was piling on gratitude to a bemused Garaad. Apparently the first scout group had been ambushed by the swamp giant bastards and were going to be used in some sort of hoodoo gumbo ritual to resurrect a dead god- one of the swamp giants was going to eat it and become some sort of divine aspect.\n\nWell, we didn't take kindly to this, so we started thinking of ways to sabotage it. We pooled our resources- we had a lot of stabby implements, a lot of magic that was about as subtle as a freight train, a [darklight lantern](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment---final/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Lantern) (which Garaad had somehow gotten his hands on) and some rations. Dwarven rations...\n\nAnd just like that, we had a plan. Garaad started burning the lantern, and everything got really dark. All of our melee fighters had darkvision, so they got into position while the giants gathered around the cauldron figuring that the ritual was coming to a head. Then Garaad dropped a loaf of [dwarf bread](http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Dwarf_Bread) into the cauldron...\n\nThe swamp giant who drank the brew was the lucky one- HE just started vomiting blood. The rest of the guys there started screaming things about suddenly missing limbs, flying axes and a snarling ball of unresolved daddy issues. It was a slaughter- the battle was over before it even began. I don't think the casters launched a single magic missile. Then we piled all of the corpses into a big fire while the halfling we had rescued danced a merry jig. That was a good day.\n\nExcept for the part where the cleric's skull buddy exploded and lodged a piece of shrapnel into the unfortunate healer's brain. But it was okay, because now we had a new caster- a wizard who smelled like a dumpster, claimed he came from the future, and wore this weird bread-burning machine on his head. It was really weird, it had this odd rope coming out of it that ended in metal prongs... and why would you want to burn bread in the first place? Anyway, after a little negotiation (consisting of \"You killed our cleric!\" \"You're crazy!\" and \"You smell like piss!\") he agreed to fill the gap left in our party. Oh- and if our commanders asked, he was the cleric and he had always looked like that. Garaad didn't bother asking why.\n\nBut there was more out there. Though we had established a good base camp, there was still a lot of unexplored jungle. We set off on a few expeditions- one ended with us going full lumberjack on an evil tree stump, another involved a rubbery bridge (a hippo) that our barbarian decided to murder for no goddamn reason- before we finally decided to address the issue of the seemingly active volcano in the middle of the jungle. What, did I not mention that? Because there was a rumbling, smoking mountain in the center of the freaking jungle. The group decided that they had better check it out- Lava isn't good for railways.\n\nSo we set off for it. And upon entering a suspiciously large cave mouth, we found a red dragon. It was just sitting there, napping, resting on a large pile of what might be treasure but was more likely the contents of an outhouse (going by the smell). Garaad knew that fucking with dragons was a thing that you just didn't do if you liked being alive, so he was carefully guiding the group away from the slumbering beast when our barbarian decided that he wanted to be an hero and charged the scaly bastard.\n\nGaraad was PISSED. But he also wasn't about to abandon a comrade for no reason (because a dragon would probably just hunt him down anyway) so he reluctantly joined in battle. Garaad burned all of his ki points hacking off the dragon's wings, the dwarf fighter went a bit ax-crazy, our new hobo-wizard rained down magic missiles, and our bundle of daddy issues breathed a gout of fire onto the (***RED***) dragon's face. We were all really surprised when that actually worked and the dragon keeled over before it could do anything other than scorch everyone with its fire aura and belt Garaad with a well-placed claw.\n\nAfter that, our barbarian had a very apologetic conversation with Garaad about the virtues of not getting the party killed, showing restraint and using strategy, and could you *pretty please* take that sword out of my foot now?\n\nGaraad was tired from the day's events and sorta checked out while the rest of the party combed through the \"loot\"- they said something about it actually being a GOLD dragon, and how it had been blasted by [this other gold dragon](http://redd.it/2lb2l7), and then exiled from dragon town on account of being utterly nut-shit insane. The party congratulated themselves for ending this heinous threat before it could find and destroy our big flying airship. That's cool, I guess- anyone got a healing spell? No? A potion, maybe? Was there one in the dragon's hoard? What do you mean it was hoarding rusted metal and mud pies? You mean we killed this thing over a pile of rubbish and dung!?\n\nAt least the dwarves managed to pry off some of the scales for a tidy sum, but this just sucked. It was all shadowy in there, nothing shiny or beautiful, so Garaad was bummed. The party decided to cheer him up by letting him take a midnight stroll through the jungle. Towards our airdinghy. Sword drawn. With orders to stab anything that looked menacing. Garaad could do that.\n\nWe got back to the ship in record time. It would have been even faster if the barbarian hadn't cried and bled the whole way on account of his mangled foot. And guess who got to hold the heavy stuff?\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Attention deficit\", TRUE GUARDIANS AND THE EVICTION NOTICE!](http://redd.it/2mlp2m)",

        "text": "So, I'm playing on Manager mode on semi-pro difficulty. As I'm not a traditional fifa player, this level of difficulty is really tough for me to play. I'm manager of Manchester Utd and we had a match against Everton in capital one cup (quarterfinal). It was a home match so I was pretty confident about winning it. I decided to play the match instead of watching it (this is what I usually do). \n\nSixth minute of the game. Carrick gives a long cross to Ashley Young on left flank. Young takes it forward and gives a cross right into the pentalty area, and boom Rooney heads it for goal.\n\nI became so confident that I thought I was going to win it right away. I became relaxed and this is where I did the mistake.\n\n14th minute of the game, one of the Everton player hits a long shot (must have been more than 22 yards) and it goes into the goal. I'm still relaxed thinking I would score once again and win it. \n\n43rd minute. Everton player rushing from the right flank. Me defenders trying to stop him, but they couldn't. He hits a cross and they scores another goal with the help of a header. I was destroyed. Now I realized that shit was getting serious.\n\n\nSecond half was full of struggle for me. Many shots on target and many misses. It came into the 90th minute. 3 minutes of added time. The commentator said \"Manchester united are expert of late goals, and this is what they need here: a late goal\". This is what inspired me. I worked hard for a final attack. Rooney got the ball, and worked it into the box. Goalkeeper rushed forward, I quickly realized this and hit a lob shot. It went flying above the head of keeper right into the goal. I was so happy. I finally was able to hit an equalizer.\n\nFast forward into extra time. Both of us tried hard to get a goal. After 4 to 5 shots on target from both sides, no goals were scored at the end of extra time. It came to the penalty shootout and this is where the drama intensified.\n\nBoth of us scored goals in first two shots. Then came my chance for third shot. I missed it. Everything seemed lost. Then came Evertonian player and he scored a goal. I felt things slipping. Then came my chance, missed it again. it was 2-3. They needed only one goal to take it away from me. \n\nThe player came and hit the shot right into the pole. My loss was delayed. I hit the goal in my chance. it was 3-3.\n\nAnother Everton player came, I anticipated his shot direction and yeah, I saved the goal. It was the best moment in my entire life. It was 3-3.\n\nThen came my chance, hell yeah I scored..!! I made it 4-3. Now the only thing I needed was a save by my goalkeeper.\n\nThere came the opponent. I literally had my fingers crossed. I took a deep breath and pressed the button to jump in the right. He hit the shot in right and the goalkeeper saved it. I won it..!! I couldn't believe it. So much drama..!! This was the best moment for me while playing fifa 14...!!",

        "text": "[A continuing tale of Garaad the ditzy ninja.](http://redd.it/2m1uqg) For those of you who weren't here last time, Garaad had just got his first dose of city life, which consisted of filling an entire room with hydra blood. Now, our dim hero has made his way onto an airship where he was hired on as security for a railway-building operation. As he's dazedly examining his new quarters, he meets his new comrades...\n\nOne is a dwarf fighter by the name of Wurthaal. She was nice. The other one was a dwarf barbarian named Bearsteel. He was kinda angry and had a [weird hat](http://i.imgur.com/4m5wEjN.jpg). She had a beard. He didn't. When you asked him about it, he would try to punch you.\n\nSoon enough, an official looking guy comes in and gives us our mission briefing. We're to go down to a floating island and make sure things are prepared for a construction crew to come in and build a railway. Generally, this means murdering things we don't like and comething about negotiating with indigenous people, but around here the officer trailed off and asked [why there was a grey dude standing sideways on the wall](http://i.imgur.com/5gebRR8.jpg).\n\nAnyway, we made our way down to the island on a little airdinghy and set down outside the largest settlement. We took a casual stroll through a lovely grassy field while marveling at the sights- the sea of clouds, the way the wind rustled the stalks, and how the light glinted off the horns of those murderous rabbit-unicorns- oh right, we were fighting some of those guys. And then the dwarves started bickering about how much cash you could get for a \"genuine unicorn horn\".\n\nWe arrived in the town to find a large gathering around some gallows. There were a few people wearing stylish rope collars, and the whole town was jeering at them for something about unholy and impure acts. One was an elf, one was a human, and one was a kid. The human said something about loving his family before they dropped him down and broke his neck.\n\nGaraad did not have an opinion on this. Compared to being devoured by hideous shadowplane monsters, a public execution was downright tame. Plus, hey, these weird material world guys probably have all sorts of funny customs. But the dwarves looked angry for some reason. The fighter-dwarf marched up to the ringleader to see what the heck was going on, the barbarian-dwarf ran off to an item shop to \"procure\" a few things (involving some intimidation that was so wildly successful that the shopkeeper shat himself) and Garaad just watched things from a nearby rooftop.\n\nOur fighter-dwarf had gotten into a discussion with the ringleader of the mob (a paladin) about the finer aspects of absolute theological purity, and why it was a load of bullshit. He started talking about the value of purity and seperation in all things, and she started talking about stuff like people with different talents cooperating, the mixed composition of clothes and rock formations... for some reason the paladin was getting really upset. Garaad thought he should join in the discussion and brought up a few more topics, like the blend of alloys in weapons-grade metal and wow, hey, that cloak is really pretty- it's like blue and red, mixed together.\n\nThis seemed to really annoy the paladin for some reason.\n\nMeanwhile, our barbarian dwarf had pilfered some weapons from the store, and had charged onto the gallows and cut through the ropes tied around the elf and the kid's necks. He then went full nut-shit and started raging, swinging weapons at anyone who looked at him funny and occasionally breathing a gout of fire... while he was standing on a wooden podium and surrounded by angry, armed villagers. The paladin we were talking to had apparently decided that our words made us a threat to his theology, and he started trying to smite our asses.\n\nFinally, a straightforward situation that Garaad understood- a bunch of people trying to kill him and his friends. With all the attention on the firebreathing idiot, Garaad was easily able to bisect a few distracted villagers and guardsmen. Meanwhile, the fighter-dwarf was having a smackdown with the paladin, who was no pushover- his armor was defelcting a large amount of the incoming attacks. Garaad tried to lend assistance with a timely sneak attack, but flat-footed enemies still have armor, and this guy had some to spare. Garaad took a few nasty blows, and retreated to go back to fighting the much squishier town guard.\n\nFinally, the barbarian-dwarf threw the fighter-dwarf a sweet axe, which she used to, *ahem*, segregate the paladin's head from his shoulders. Rather less fortunately, the entire town was now moderately on fire. They had to drag Garaad away from the pretty lights.\n\nAnd with that, we had \"secured\" the town- everyone intelligent had fled for their lives, and we'd saved the elf and the kid, so it was a win, right? And hey, ash is good for the environment. Nobody was going to argue if some guys put in a railway, either. And those religious guys were assholes.\n\nGaraad was a bit confused as to why the fighter-dwarf kept rattling off things like that. It was like she was trying to convince somebody of something, but no one was listening as far as he could tell. Maybe she was talking to him? Hard to say- ooh, a butterfly!\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"An heroes\", CUTTING A TRAIL AND DOING GOOD WORK!](http://redd.it/2mbuce)",

I currently have 6 players in my group, only 3 of which are actually my students.  The group is 5 men; Jason, Patty, LeeSin, Loki, Chang, and one woman, Karris.  Karris and LeeSin are gaming newbies.  I've gamed with Chang, Jason and Patty for a couple of years now.  We're using the White Wolf game system home-brewed for mortals vs. zombies ala *The Walking Dead*.\n\nThis is what happened last night:\n\nOnly one wounded man yet lives. A lone man who's only wish is to join his wife and son. He is now totally alone after his party was fooled by a family of three survivors.\n\nThe group approached a house and checked the windows.  Two zombies stood in the living room.  They hopped the privacy fence and found that the backyard wasn't overgrown as usual, it was a full garden.  Curious.\n\nMost of the party congregated on the back patio and debated what to do.  Jason was impatient and kicked open the back door to deal with the two \"walkers\" inside. The female \"zombie\" drew a gun and shot at him. Jason, shocked, dove for the floor.  His beloved silenced pistol, Junior, skidded away from him.\n\nChang was standing in the back yard, keeping watch when he heard a noise above his head.  A shotgun pointed out of an upstairs window.  Cocky Chang drew his bow, looked up and said, \"Don't make me put one in you.\" BLAM! The shotgun roared and he fell back into the corn, his chest a bloody red ruin.\n\nLeeSin ran in to save Jason. He paused in the doorway, shot and wounded the female. At the same time, the male \"zombie's\" hand-cannon erupted. BLAM! LeeSin fell dead in the doorway.\n\nJason dove out of the window in a cascade of shattered glass. He and Loki jumped the fence and hid next door. Karris and Patty ran the other way and joined them. \n\nJason couldn't leave Junior behind.  He demanded Karris' gun.  She pushed him away.  He snatched the pistol and ran to get Junior back. He  saw the barrel in the upstairs window and stopped to shoot. BLAM! The shotgun roared again and Jason, Heisman Trophy winning running back from Alabama, jailed for crack, released and rehabilitated 2 months before the end of the world, died in the street.\n\nLoki ran for the car. BLAM! The shotgun dropped him to the pavement. BLAM! After the second blast, Loki should have died. He. Should. Have. Died. Some power prevented his death, though he knows he is closer to his family.  He pretended to be dead, laid in the street, and waited for his chance.\n\nBack in the house next door, Patty, desperate for a weapon, pulled his pepper spray on Karris. She swung her bat in self-defense and glanced a blow off of his thick skull. The spray did its job and blinded her.  She screamed, clawed at her eyes and dropped the bat. Patty scooped it up and swung for the cheap seats. Her head split like a ripe melon.\n\nLoki rolled under the car. He climbed out, climbed in, and sped away.\nPatty heard the car leave. He had no choice but to run back. Halfway to safety, he killed two zombies on the road. Within sight of the Fort, nine zombies blocked his path.\n\nWhere once there were nine, now there are ten.\n\nOnly one wounded man lived. The only one that wanted to die.\n\nHe's cursed to live on.\n\nAlone.",

        "text": "I had been playing the tomb of horrors recently with a party including a wizard (myself), a barbarian, a rogue and a paladin. We came to a section of corridor that featured a 100ft pit in the center. At the bottom of the pit was a zombie of some description. Realizing that it held zero threat and climbing down the trap would take more effort than it is worth we closed up the trap and disabled it.\nWe continued on and found a secret door leading to a set of stairs and another set of double doors. We opted for the double doors in search of loot and other dungeon paraphernalia. We were greeted by another set of doors and kept going only to find yet another set of double doors.\nAs per usual we had the rogue search for traps. With none found we tried to open it. Before we knew it the party barring the wizard due to a 20 roll on fortitude and some terrible rolling on their path lay unconscious on the floor from a strange gas. Suddenly the door was beginning to open so before it could I used the hold portal spell to buy us some time. Rolling just the right amount I was able to pull the party clear of the gas. The creature on the other side no doubt going to break through soon. We needed a plan when it hit us... The trap we had disabled.\nWe moved down the corridor and positioned ourselves between the trap and where it would be coming from. The rogue rearmed the trap. We prepared ourselves as much as possible loading crossbows and looking at my spell list. Soon the creature made it through (thanks to some bad rolls on its part, much more time than it should have taken) and we saw a stone golem in the shape of an elephant on log rollers.\nHowever, it was too big to fit through the secret door before the trap. While also attacking it with any missile weapons we could, we also attacked the wall. It's continued battering of the wall as well as our own bombardment caused a large enough hole to form allowing it to advance. As expected, it fell into the trap and plunged 100ft on top of the zombie causing the death of both and a rather satisfying kill.\ntl:dr Used a trap in the dungeon to cause an elephant on rollers to fall 100ft onto a zombie killing both.\n\nEdit: Grammer and paragraphs",

        "text": "/* \nParty:\nKor, Male human gunslinger, quitet engineer who will wield both his guns and tongue with the same deadly presicion. Only one in the party who can actualy heal wounds. Others think him to be a bit unstable.\n\nElric Male elven rogue, Quiet, unless there's something to be said. He's able to hide nearly everywhere and is fine being alone.\n\nElyvia: Female elven sorcerer, beaty and charm rivalving that of the succubus. Claims that dragonic blood flows within her veins and chases butterflies and other \"cute\" critters.\n*/\n\nAfter the meeting was done the party, Kor, Elric and Elyvia, an elvish sorcerer gathered their gear and made the final preparations for the journey. Kor used some of his money to purchase some lumber as he had a feeling that the forest near the shore would be protected. Even if it wouldn’t be, good lumber has it’s uses in other ways as well. Elric and Elyvia weren’t thinking that it would become a problem, but what would those elves know? For all Kor knew they’d be hunting butterflies and hugging trees, all the while he needed to deal with the monstrous guardians those two pissed off. In the end however Elric and Elyvia helped Kor to transport all that lumber in their bags of holding.\n\nThe ship wasn’t your typical wood and sails ship. It was some sort of mechanical construct and seemed to be able to walk on the land as well. Gragd showed it’s armament to Kor, waiting his amazed reaction, was disappointed and mildly offended as Kor thought that they were on the “slimmer” side of the cannons he had used. Gragd was more understanding as Kor told what kind of behemoth cannon he had used previously. After one has fired 100 ft wide cannon to vaporise half of enemy encampment, all other cannons are on the “slimmer” side.\n\nAfter they were all aboard and were on the open sea, Gragd came to usher the party inside the ship. It seemed that staying outside wasn’t an option. Gragd wasn’t telling the party any reasons why, but everyone agreed to go inside anyway. It was good thing that they did so, as the door closed behind them the ship started to sink. Kor had heard about ships that can travel under the water, but it was his first time to be in one. He was also glad that there weren’t too many windows either, as he feared that his fear of water would make a mess in these confined halls.\n\nAfter a few minutes he saw water droplets forming to the ceiling and soon after there were water leaking inside from multiple small holes. It seemed that the ship would sink soon at this rate, but Kor wasn’t afraid of that. To be clear he wasn’t afraid at all, all that he could feel was this ungodly desire to be with the water, in the deep corner of the sea, blanketing his fear of water. he just stood there and let the water soak into his clothes, while other party was standing there confused. \n\nAs suddenly as leaks started, they stopped without any apparent reason. Just then Kor noticed Gragd’s smug smile, as the dwarf then explained his and the crew’s little welcoming prank. There weren’t any leaks, as they used some kind of apparatus that’s normally used to contain fire inside the ship. Kor left the matter alone, as pranks are just pranks, but couldn’t get that odd desire out of his head. He silently pondered which of the decisions would have had worse outcome, drinking the potion, or leaving it alone. At least now they still have crew alive and could travel to the island without blood covering the interior walls of the ship.\n\nThe voyage went on smoothly and most problematic thing was to find a mess hall and get something to eat. Elric was in worst shape in the matter as he neither could read nor use magic to understand dwarven to top it off he didn’t bring any food with him. As Kor later found out Elric had wandered quite a long time till he found himself at the mess hall. Even then Elrics problems continued as only way he could get some food was to input correct commands to certain machine, which used only dwarven. Some of the sailors told Kor that Elric got vegetable steak not only once, but twice and it’s only given when someone fumbles with the inputs. For some reason though, Elric managed to order his drink properly, but even then it was strongest dwarven ale known in the world.\n\nKor and Tanith found completely drunk Elric just after he decided to destroy his unholy steaks by headbutting them, covering half of the table with remains of vegetable steaks. Kor promptly ordered food and drinks for himself and Tanith, getting everything he wanted as he understood dwarven and had used same kind of machine previously. He then went to the same table as Elric already was, as there weren’t anyone else at the moment.\n\nSomehow this woke Elric and he offered his drink to Kor. It was nearly full, but Kor still downed it all, as these things should be drank. Feeling comfortably drunk Kor went through his bag and took a small barrel out. While he refilled Elric’s pint with a ale, he recalled how and when he got the barrel himself. Regretting that he couldn’t put barones’ body in his bag and her too swift passing, he offered pint back. “ This is good stuff so savor it well” Kor said just before Elric started to drink it.\n\nSlowly but surely Elric downed it all and his blissful expression was thanks enough for the ale. If nothing else, that ghoul of a bartender knew his ales. Kor continued to eat his meal quietly and only after finishing it he noticed that Elric had passed out. Tiny sparkle of mischief took Kor over as he pushed Elric enough that he fell on the ground, still soundly passed out. Kor however lost his interest on ridiculing Elric further and decided to call it a night. Together with Tanith they chose an empty room which Kor locked so that they could be undisturbed.\n\nAfter only couple of hours had passed Gragd knocked on the door. Reluctantly Kor Put his trousers on and opened the door to know what Gragd had to say. Behind him Tanith came along, covering herself with the bedsheets. Gragd told Kor that he has been summoned to the bridge, that they would try to get to surface as soon as possible. Kor told that he’d need ten minutes to get ready and closed the door before he’d heard Gragd’s reply.\n\nWithin that ten minutes Kor, with Tanith next to him arrived to the bridge. It became obvious why they were trying to reach the surface, as the whole deck was filled with fishmen that tried to club the submarine to death. Ship’s captain told that there was kraken slowing them down at the rear. Both groups would have to be dealt with before the ship could continue to the Island. Others from the party were already there, elrich still feeling the effects of his drinks and Elyvia explaining something or another of one spell of her’s. All that Kor was interested in the sorcerer’s rambling was to make sure that she wouldn’t cast it while he was within the effective area.\n\nAs soon as the ship broke to surface the party assaulted the deck readying himself for slaughter. The party faced the swarm of fishmen while the crew went to hack the Kraken off the ship. While rushing into fray of combat Kor yelled in aquan so that the fishermen would understand “ Off my ship you fools”. Suddenly Kor halted, as he sensed something odd. With a better look of the battlefield he noticed that not only did he succeed in shaking his enemy, even Elric in his drunken stupor was fallen under his influence. Waiting a bit so that fishmen could react somehow he took a look to the rear of the ship. Crew was already fully absorbed in their fight, there even was an elf paladin, orkish barbarian and Gragd with them hacking Kraken’s tentacles. As fishmen were still standing where they were, Kor thought that they needed to be pushed a bit more and shot twice into air and yelled again.\n\nThis time only Tanith and himself were unaffected. All the fishmen and Elric were lost all of their will and were just shaking in fear, while Elyvia was seemingly disturbed. While having nothing else to do, he began throwing fishmen overboard one, by one until they mustered enough courage to actually run away by their own. \n\nIt was soon confirmed that all of the fishmen were running away, Kor opened fire against the Kraken, saving hides of few sailors, the paladin and barbarian alike. In the corner of his vision he saw Elric slaying one fleeing fisman by slashing it’s back. While Kor knew that Elric had his way of rogue and thief alike, he belittled Elric, congratulating him as a masterful swordsman that has the courage to slash fleeing enemy’s back open. He also pointed that it was pure murder of innocent sentient being that hadn’t harmed anyone onboard. Kor’s words seemed to affect Elric in overall positive way, as he regained his senses. Kor however didn’t have luxury to ponder whether it was due to boiling rage or whatnot, as he heard loud noises, as if something was trying to climb aboard.\n\nWhen he looked what could be trying to get on the ship, he shouted to others shaking “ Brace yourselves, madness is coming!” After backing where the rest of the party was gathered, they all saw dragon coming aboard. It landed not too far from them and asked why they have brought this monster to his kingdom. Elyvia started to talk in fluent drakonic and translated Dragon’s speech to the rest of the party until it decided to change to the “language of the slaves”. It also told that if Kor would carry it’s name, Amdhaegar the Dragon of the void, it would let them pass it’s kingdom in peace.\n\nKor however disagreed to become slave to the Amdhaegar. The mere thought of lowering his head to someone else was revolting to him. Elric had already put his weapons down, unable to withstand the horrors and his drunkard self anymore, while Elyvia beratted Kor’s lack of respect toward the M’raght. It seemed that she had some dragonic blood running inside her veins or just one more of her madness. There wasn’t any meaning to think which one it was.\n\nAfter as many suicide missions as Kor had there was something he had gained from them, an uncanny battle sense. That alone allowed him to act when while Amdhaegar was still rising for attack. Aiming for Amdhaegar’s wing Kor attempted to shoot it down. He managed to land his shot precisely and making great bleeding wound. However by sheer luck Amdhaegar managed to keep both it’s wing and continue flying. Before anyone else could, or would react Amdhaegar took Tanith and flew under water.\n\nStunned by what had happened Kor just stood there for a moment. Then desperately asked Elyvia to cast a spell that would allow him to breathe underwater. Elyvia was reluctant and asked if Kor would harm a dragon again, claiming that all was his fault and that he was the first to strike. Kor lied straight faced that he wouldn’t do anything to the dragon. On the hindsight he most likely couldn’t form any kind of expression at that time, even if he’d wanted to. Just as he was jumping to the water he noticed that the ship has sailed forward the whole time, making any effort to look for Tanith fruitless. Defeated he just remained there, looking to the rear without actually seeing anything.\n\nAt some point the crew came all bloodied up. They were quite loud and merry group until Gragd and barbarian noticed Kor. They silenced others and ushered everyone inside, leaving Kor alone on the deck. Kor himself walked to the rear of the ship and watched to the horizont. Somehow he couldn’t avert his gaze from there, not until he’d see something, anything. After a while he saw a black spot on the sky, a figure of something or another. But he couldn’t tell what. He however had a hope burning inside of him.\n\nAt that time the Captain came to him and asked Kor to come inside, as they were going to submerge again. Kor asked if the captain had a spyglass with him, which the captain gave to Kor without asking why. However only thing that Kor gained by trying to look that black dot with the spyglass was that it indeed was carrying something. With this knowledge he returned the spyglass to the captain and went to the bridge, where he were watching the endless darkness of the sea without sleeping.\n\nGragd came at some point to talk with Kor, but soon left as Kor wasn’t responding much to his attempts to hold conversation. Elyvia came as well, still ranting about how dragons are awesome and should be revered to how everything was Kor’s fault. Somehow Kor didn’t impale her with his rifle at the spot, which managed to confuse him. It just seemed futile to do anything else than watch the sea. For the first time in his life Kor truly prayed to the gods.",

        "text": "Previous session here: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2lh8e8/tour_of_darkness_session_1_welcome_to_the_jungle/\n***\nAfter last month’s missions, the squad has been reeling with what happened out in the dark jungles during their rescue mission. They’ve had a lot of time to think during some routine patrols and base defenses, but their talents will be called upon soon. We also received a new player, and a new Extra ‘battle buddy’ for said player.\n\nAndrew D. as PV2. Nelson Vaughn, the medic/radioman  \nNate L. as Pvt. Huey O’Reilly, the machine gunner  \nJoe U. as PV2. John Winchester, the marksman  \nAdam T. as PV2. Joseph Butters, the grenadier  \nAlex Q. as Pvt. Alec King, rifleman/’apprentice’ medic  \n\nWe also have a complement of NPC Extras, one for each player:  \nSgt. Frank “The Tank” LeBlanc, squad leader  \nCpl. Colin “Swaggs” Skaggs, the rifleman  \nCpl. Zander Daigle, the pointman  \nPvt. Jeremy “Pothead” Pruett, the assistant gunner  \nPvt. Edward Christopher, another rifleman  \n\nThe squad has been operating around the base for the past few weeks, and the paperwork for Nelson’s commendation has finally be processed. After review, he was given a citation of bravery on his official files. They heard nothing more on the matter of the briefcase and Huey’s pictures. Winchester finagled his way around the quartermaster to get some additional ammo for the Hush Puppy he had taken off the wounded Special Forces soldier last mission.\n\nSarge gathered everyone together for a new mission. Intelligence had determined that the NVA were moving over the DMZ in larger numbers than ever, and were certainly planning something in the near-future. The whole platoon was heading out, mounted on PBRs from the Navy, to search and destroy along the river path. They were to sniff out and destroy any NVA or VC elements they could find. They are also introduced to Colonel Allen Cormac, a somewhat mysterious man from ‘on high’ that they would be in charge of escorting during the duration of this four day patrol.\n\nThe squad readied their equipment and jogged down to the river, where the four PBRs were waiting. The squad was stationed on the Merry Empress, under command of Petty Officer First Class Bostic. He instructed the squad to stay out of he and his crew’s way, and listen to his every word. The squad dropped their gear and got as comfortable as they could.\n\nThe first obstacle was what Bostic called ‘Cong Junction’, a section of waterway where they always came under heavy fire from both sides of the river. The squad ducked down as the four PBRs gunned their engines, intent on blasting through the section of river. As soon as they arrived rifle and machine gun fire started to pepper the water, and a rocket even sailed overhead. Some of the squad fires blindly over the sides of the boat, and Butters lobs a grenade to hopefully suppress the VC from firing any more. Peering through his scope, Winchester manages to nail one right in the head, watching his body tumble into the river. Sarge opens fire with one of his LAWs, but the rocket strikes a tree, showering the area with wooden shrapnel. As the PBRs pull out of the danger zone, both Nelson and Huey are hit by stray rounds coming from the barrage.\n\nIn the clear, Alec helps Nelson treat himself, then jumps to patch up Huey. Just after recovering from that intense display of firepower, they pull over a sampan. They are ordered to search it, and several jump over to investigate. The man claims he is just a farmer trying to get his rice downriver. Alec makes the farmer’s son cry, and they determine that he isn’t a threat. They leave the sampan and keep on up-river.\n\nLater in the day, Zander and Butters are on point, scoping out the river ahead for any danger. Butters notices something amiss, a squad shape that seems out of place in the jungle. It’s a bunker, and he shouts a warning as he drops to a knee. Acting in the moment, he grabs his LAW and fires it towards the foreboding shape. The explosion rocks the area, and Bostic stops the boat so they can investigate. Zander and Butters swim over and discover the remains of at least four NVA, and a DShK machine gun nest. Everyone congratulates Butters.\n\nNight falls, so the boats pull over for the rest of the night. Standard protocol is at least four hours of sleep while on patrol, so the group breaks into watches. Huey is up first, and he notices monkeys wandering around on the jungle floor. Tempted as he is, he does not open fire, and doesn’t tell anyone as he gives watch to Nelson. Going for a perimeter walk on his watch, Nelson comes across the body of a monkey, which looks like it was ravaged by some wild animal. He tells Zander, who is next on watch. For the whole hour Zander can see the monkeys watching them from the treetops, slowly uneasy. Butters is on watch last, and stare at the monkeys as well. However, his keen senses detect something is wrong, and sees four shapes moving towards the group. A VC scouting party. He slowly taps everyone awake, pointing out the threat as they get closer.\n\nWinchester opens fire, but misses barely and knocks off the hat of one of the trailing member. Swaggs, bayonet fixed, charges into the group but misjudges his lunge, passing by his attacker. In the low-light and confusion, Butters does not know his comrade is in the way, and opens fire with a buckshot round from his M79. It flays three of the VC, and also strikes Swaggs as well, who goes down. Zander caps the last fleeing VC member, and Winchester pulls Swaggs back to camp for immediate medical attention. The only ones that saw the incident were Winchester, Butters, and Zander.\n\nNelson pulls out all the stops, ripping off Swaggs shirt and applying sulfa powder to help stabilise him. One of his kidneys got hit, and it looks pretty bad. Sarge tells Nelson to call in a medevac, and he switches off with Alec to do so. Huey and Butters clear an LZ for the bird to land, and they pass Swaggs along. He’ll be sent back to the medical tent and probably home, if he survives.\n\nThe next morning the mood is rather somber. This is the second day of the mission, and they load back up onto the PBRs for another day of patrolling. As they drift along down the river, eyes peeled for any suspicious activity, they manage to catch six VC crossing a bridge, caught off guard. The group opens up on them. Huey strikes one with his M60, sending him flat to the ground in panic. Pothead hits another right in the head, and the body hits the water hard. Butters squints and hits the bridge right in the center, causing it to buckle and collapse, killing at least two more. Another falls in the water, and Sarge announces that they’ll take him prisoner. They fish him out of the water as Winchester kills the last man on the bridge. They tie up the prisoner to one of the PBRs support beams, and Colonel Cormac nods his approval.\n\nThe rest of the day goes by without much instance, and they park it again for the night. The squad wanders a few yards from the shore and comes across a strange temple. They head inside with flashlights, and find strange carvings featuring humans attacking and eating humans, and humans offering other humans to some snake-man hybrids. Winchester also finds a small niche with a pendant in it, which he takes. The rest of the night is uneventful.\n\nThey wake up the next morning to start the third day of patrolling. They start along the way and start the day off by stopping another sampan, an early-riser evidently. Zander and Butters board the boat and question the man while Winchester watches from the PBR with his pistol drawn. Both he and Butters see the farmer going for something in his shirt, and Winchester shoots him in the head. The body falls to the floor of the boat, and Butter and Zanders pull everything apart, uncovering twelve AK-47s hidden under the boards. Bostic handed them a WP grenade and they set the boat ablaze. Elated by this solid find, they continue on.\n\nCormac checks his map again and pulls the boat over. They’re close to where the suspected NVA staging area is, so we wants to check it out. The squad disembarks and heads through the jungle on foot. About an hour in they find it, but the whole area seems abandoned. Butters spots a corpse through his binoculars, but it appears to be have dissolved by acid or something similar. Cormac pulls out his pistol and heads down to investigate, leaving the other squad and Winchester on the ridge to provide overwatch.\n\nThe squad investigates, but finds no signs of life, though a North Vietnamese flag still flutters on the flagpole. He pulls Nelson aside and starts with the radio, and he medic overhears his conversation. He seems worried about the fact that he found nothing here, stating that ‘those bastards went and did it’. He hangs up and instructs Butters and Zander to search the well.\n\nThe duo looks down the stone structure, and sees the water, or what looks like it, surging towards them. Zander backs away in fear, gun drawn. Butters, ever the Doubting Thomas, thinks it’s a geyser. The amorphous blob pours free from the well, and Cormac orders everyone to fall back to the ridge. The chase begins.\n\nThe blob is slow, and the squad gets a good leg up on him. Butters hits it with a grenade, but it seems to swallow and envelop the eruption. Sarge takes a few shots at it with his M16 but it barely seems to notice.\n\nAs the group nears the ridge, Ed turns around and takes a knee, shouldering his LAW and firing into the liquid-like mass. With a stroke of luck, the rocket sails into the thing and detonates, showering the area with jelly chunks. Unfortunately, these jelly chunks are highly acidic, and everyone attempts to flee the scene. Sarge, Ed, and Cormac are incapacitated by the acid as it burns through their skin, as well as Huey and Alec. Nelson goes to work trying to treat his friends as Alec fights through the pain to clear the wounds of Cormac, spilling his canteen onto the man to wash off the burning jelly. After thirty minutes of panic-stricken first aid, everyone seems to be okay, though Cormac is horribly burned by the acid. He grabs Nelson and tells his to call in a dust-off to get them all out of there, he’s scrubbing the mission. After several minutes the medevac choppers arrive and exfil everyone away from the camp. The PBRs will return to base with their prisoner.\n\nEveryone gets to base and goes about their business. Butters goes to visit Swaggs in the medical tent, and checks in. Swaggs will live, but is going back to the States. He is still unaware that it was Butters that shot him.\n\nEveryone is broken up on who they want to commend for a medal or citation. Their first choice is Ed, but they realize they could never explain the circumstances to any sort of official board, so they choose Nelson again, for saving almost everyone’s lives this mission. The promotion board also passes, and Butters, Pothead, and Zander receive one. Zander is made a sergeant, and gets pulled from the squad to lead another one. There will be two fresh faced Extras next session.",

        "text": "I was playing through with a group of relatively new players as the DM. Being me, I wanted to try and show them that there was more to the game than Min-Maxing and getting the most optimized character. We had a Paladin, a Thief, a Wizard, and a Druid. Out of all of the player characters, the Paladin was my favorite. He really seemed to get the whole idea I was trying to give them about getting into character.\n\n\nWe were playing in my own campaign setting, and the group had been assigned to go see why an outpost in the north had not sent back any reports in the previous weeks. The Paladin was there to be the party leader and to police the Thief and Wizard, the Druid was a local guide, and the Thief and Wizard were convicts who were being given reprieve on their sentences for following through with the mission.\n\nNow the Paladin worshiped one of my homebrew deities, Cirta/Durona, the goddess of the sun &amp; moon. She was *technically* Lawful Good, but had a very black and white view of the world. Evil was to be stomped out no matter what. The Thief and the Wizard had an uncanny habit of utilizing less than reputable means to get tasks done, and the Paladin reprimanded them for it on a near constant basis.\n\nOver time though, he began to see past their flaws and genuinely come to know them as friends. I think the defining moment was when the Thief put himself between a troll and a child that they were trying to save. But I digress. This newfound camaraderie with these criminals did not escape the attention of his Goddess however.\n\nDuring camp one night, while the Paladin was taking first watch, I told him that he heard an old hymn that he remembered of his Goddess being sung out among the trees. Going to see who was singing, he was met by a woman with her head shaved , glazed eyes, and Cirta's Sun painted on her forehead. An Aspect of the Deity. She told him that he had grown soft of late, and that he would need to prove his loyalty to her. Unsure of what she meant, he asked what he must do. She told him that he would need to execute the criminals in his party, slit their throats while they slept and offer their carcasses as tribute to her divine justice.\n\nThe Paladin's player just looked at me dumbstruck for a second, then started erasing stuff off of his character sheet. Before I asked what he was doing, he spoke in-character.\n\n**\"These are good men that I'm working with. They have troubled pasts, and their methods are questionable, but I would not be able to finish my mission without them. You want me to judge them based on their past actions, but I won't.\"**\n\nAnd with that he explained how he took off his holy symbol, his cloak, and his helmet and placed them in the woman's hands. Now it was my turn to be dumbfounded. I explained the rage that he saw in the Aspect's face as she looked up at him. I told him about the crippling nausea that he felt as his bond to the goddess was broken. She spat a curse against him, promising to make him suffer along with the criminals he cherished so much.\n\nThe Aspect left, not having enough powers of the Deity to actually do anything to the Paladin. He kept up his watch for the rest of the night and told his partners what happened when they woke up the next day. Telling them that it changed nothing, he insisted that they keep going towards the outpost. They traveled for weeks, their holy man now powerless but still a pretty bad ass combatant. As those weeks went by, I explained to him things that none of the other characters noticed. The ground he slept on was softer, he could constantly smell fresh cut apples in the air, and he found that the menial labor he did from day to day (chopping firewood, fishing, etc.) was not as tiring.\n\nIt wasn't until they stopped in at an inn that what was causing these things came to fruition though. They were sleeping in an inn for the first time in weeks, an he had a room all to himself. A servant brought him a pail of warm water to bathe with, but did not leave after putting the pail down. Instead, he drew a marking like a parapet along his forehead. His eyes glazed over and the young man introduced himself as Stehp, demi-god son of Cirta and protector of civilization. He explained how he had been watching the Paladin ever since the mortal had had the nerve to stand up to his mother. Stehp believed that mortals were just as capable of good as they were evil, and that no one was without redemption.\n\nThe two of them chatted for about half the night, and when their conversation was done, Stehp offered the Paladin his hand. **\"My worshipers have no one to protect them. How would you like to be the first paladin to stand beside me in defense of those who have to bow under tyranny?\"**\n\nOf course the Paladin accepted, his powers restored as a newly minted Paladin of Freedom. Stehp kept his mother's wrath from ever touching his appointed knight, and after the campaign the Paladin set out to found cities where people could find refuge from tyrants and oppression. The first of these was created from the refugees that survived the assault on the outpost, and eventually became a veritable mecca of liberty. Meanwhile Paladins of Stehp began cropping up all over, becoming a fully formed order based out of the free city-states by the time our Paladin died.",

        "text": "Back when D&amp;D 5e was still in beta, some friends and I ran a game using a pre-gen dungeon crawl. After raiding a hobgoblin cave system and finding some loot, they made their way back to town. Now, in the pre-gen material I was using, a non-descript tapestry had been mentioned as loot. It was maybe worth 5gp and utterly average. My friend JoJo, a bard, decided otherwise. Using a bard cantrip that let him make sound appear from nowhere he decided to drive the party mad.\n\nZak (fighter), holding the tapestry: Did anyone hear that?\n\nParty: Hear what?\n\nZak: Something just said it was going to \"Rape me in the butthole!\".\n\nMe under JoJo's directions: You hear something say \"I'm going to stab you in the wee-wee.\"\n\n(At this point, my friends think I've gone crazy and OOC start demanding I stop the shenanigans. I refuse because I'm just arbitrating the game. And cuz it's hilarious.)\n\nJojo, that sneaky clown: Here, hand me the cloth. \n\n[Tapestry exchanged]\n\nMe under JoJo's own directions: You hear something whisper, \"I'm gonna shank you MOTHERFUCKER!!\"\n\nParty: OMG it's the cloth!\n\nDaniel, he's a wizard, Harry: Hand me that. [Harmless unmagical cloth acquired.]  Can I detect any magic?\n\nMe: No\n\nJerid, a robot paladin: Do I sense evil?\n\nMe, referring to JoJo: You sense a small amount of malevolent intent.\n\nDaniel: I Fireball the fuck out of it.\n\nMe: The cloth becomes slightly singed.\n\nDaniel: Did it work? Is it dead?\n\nMe, after getting a quick note from JoJo: You hear something say, \"I'm gonna revenge fuck you with a cactus!\".\n\nDaniel: CHILLED TOUCH!\n\nMe: It becomes slightly cold.\n\nParty: Maybe there's something in town we can use to kill it.\n\n(Fast forward through a trip to a magic shop where they borrowed a magic-destroying needle to kill the Evil Tapestry, only to get thrown out for pranking a poor old woman, and JoJo volunteering to hold on to the cloth and take it back to his room while the party went shopping)\n\nParty, coming back to their rooms: Honey, we're home.\n\nJoJo: blegh....\n\n[Scene: JoJo splayed out on the floor with several stab wounds in the stomach and a bloody knife inconspicuously placed on a tapestry.]\n\nParty: We need to leave.\n\n(To clarify, JoJo literally stabbed himself to near death and framed a piece of fabric.)\n\nTLDR: Bards can fuck up any game in the best ways.",

I was also thinking of replacing existing deities with weird ones like a spaghetti god, or a god of steak, or anything  made up. \n\nIs this a good idea?

        "text": "Gather round, children, and I will tell you of my second pathfinder character, Garaad the ditzy ninja. He was actually created as part of a seperate campaign hosted by an inexperienced DM, but we only had one session, and I felt that his talents were wasted. So when I heard talk of a new campaign close on the heels of our [previous one](http://redd.it/2kxcbs), I dusted off his character sheet and brought him back into the limelight. Well, I say limelight, but...\n\nGaraad was interesting to play. He was a [fetchling](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-fetchling), so he hailed from the shadowplanes- a place that is at once bleary, empty, depressing, dark, and home to lots of lovely beasties that would just LOVE to devour all of your internal organs. Or enslave you. It's not a nice place, is what I'm saying. So, after his family/traveling caravan was torn apart by some lovely demonic thing, Garaad discovered that there was a plane of existence that WASN'T generally awful, and he jumped at the chance to marvel at all the beautiful lights and colors in the wonderful land where murder didn't happen on an hourly basis.\n\nThat was the core of his personality. He genuinely thought that the material world was endlessly beautiful. He would always be distracted by beautiful sights and sounds, to the point of sensory overload. He also wasn't terribly good at morals- he only had a vague understanding of right and wrong, and would usually just emulate whoever seemed like they were in charge at the time.\n\nBut enough about that. When Garaad first arrived in a real town, he marveled at all the pretty colors, and how nothing had tried to kill him yet. Eventually he wandered into an inn on the shadier end of town so that he could get a bite to eat- he could smell food, and he vaguely understood the idea of trading currency for things. But of course, once he was there, some shit went down. An ogre bust through the door, marched up to a distracted barwench, and asked dimly if the drunkard he had just picked up qualified as a meal. One dismissive remark later, and there was a lot more screaming happening.\n\nThankfully, help was on the scene in the form of a catfolk rogue who figured that she might score the drunk guy's wallet if she played her cards right. Garaad was also *reasonably* sure that this was something bad, because of all the panicking and screaming and blood flying everywhere, and decided to stab the ogre with his [~~elven~~ fetchling curve blade](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment---final/weapons#exotic-two-handed). A brief scuffle with a lot of flanking and sneak attacks followed, and we had saved the drunkard. And his wallet. And the wallets of his friends. I guess a weird grey dude with a sword who acts a bit like a stoner is a good distraction.\n\nThe rogue decided to stick with Garaad for a while, figuring him for an easy dupe that wouldn't notice if he got less than half of the reward money. She was probably correct. Almost immediately afterwards, we were flagged down by a merchant who had watched the scuffle and decided that he could use our assistance. He said something about pest control and what may very well be a handsome reward, and before we knew it we were dumped into the cargo hold of a small airship.\n\nGaraad went around examining all the cannons and barrels of gunpowder while the rogue set off to find some 'cargo' to 'secure'. She didn't get far before she ran into a young hydra.\n\nNot one to question these things, both of us immediately assessed the situation- namely, the hydra is over THERE, stuck in a doorway, and we are over HERE, armed with ranged weapons. We danced around the edge of its range, pelting it with piddly little shurikens and crossbow bolts, but even young hydras regenerate pretty fast, and every so often it worked its way a little bit further through the door. So the rogue grabbed one of the barrels of gunpowder and hucked it at the bad monster, who caught it in its mouth. Then the rogue shot a flaming crossbow bolt at it.\n\nIn the wake of the explosion, Garaad edged around the side of the room and tried to sneak up on the beastie- not an easy task when you're fighting something at least three levels higher than you with three heads in a well-lit, enclosed space. After the gunpowder exploded and took off one of the heads, Garaad used his chance to dart in and slice one of the ugly thing's heads off.\n\nFor those of you who have fought hydras before, you know why this is a bad idea. Garaad did not know, and tried to press his 'advantage' by vaulting onto the back of the sucker and trying to hack off the last head with his not-a-katana. But the damage just wasn't enough, and stump #2 decided that regeneration is better sooner rather than later.\n\nGaraad was backed into a corner. The thing had three heads again, and while it was hurting, he was about to be hurting a lot more. So Garaad called upon his [ninja bullshit powers](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/alternate-classes/ninja#TOC-Ki-Pool-Su-) and [burned every single Ki point he had to slice the mean snake-thing to tiny bits](http://fav.me/d6z087o). It was an overwhelming success.\n\nAfterwards, Garaad got woozy from blood loss and overexertion and kinda checked out for a bit while he marveled at how beatifully green hydra blood was. The rogue was still doing things, though, and seemed kind of in a hurry because of some sort of flickering yellow light that had been around ever since the keg had gone off. And there was something about going into the cargo hold, and holding a lot of heavy stuff, and leaving very quietly because \"there might be other hydras around\". Garaad was good at being quiet, and if he kept in the shadows, it was hard to keep track of him.\n\nAfter that some people started yelling at him, and he put down the big heavy box and dazedly asked what was happening. The rogue tried to run away, but some armored guys caught her and made her put down a lot of bags filled with shiny coins. Then they took her away, which was a bit distressing. But the armored guys were a bit nicer to Garaad, and let him sleep in a little room with a bed and a window. There were bars all over the place, but when it got dark, Garaad was very good at slipping past things, so he went on a walk under the night sky. Maybe he'd go back to the nice little room later, but the stars were just so pretty.\n\nGaraad wandered his way back to the airship docks, where they were loading up a really big ship. There were lots of fighter-looking guys getting on, and there was a lot of food and weapons getting loaded up too. Garaad asked if he could admire the ship, and maybe catch a ride somewhere.\n\nAnd that's how Garaad ended up stumbling into a new occupation as a crewman on the SS Sexy Condor, a ship that was setting off from the floating continent of Nuvo to run a railway onto some of the nearby islands. Garaad was signed up to be a scout and vanguard, securing locations before a laboring crew set down the tracks. They even gave him a nice room with a bunch of beds in it (which was MUCH nicer than the little room with the bars in it) and let him wash the dried blood off his outfit. And he had a few bunkmates, too...\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Things that bother you never bother me\", A NEW FAMILY AND BIG INDUSTRY VS A BUNCH OF RABBITS!](http://redd.it/2m98z0)",

        "text": "As the DM of a homebrew campaign gratuitously tweaking v3.5, I've hit my party with a variety of environmental challenges as they've ventured into the arctic region of Kholorros known as the Eastern Pearl. The party consists of aging pirate and self-titled 'Captain' Nathaniel Flint; Chatya, recently sworn in privateer on a quest to kill her traitorous swashbuckling brother; Darek (pronounced \"Dah-wreck\", but openly mocked by the party as \"Derrick\") a monk who has inexplicably turned to drink and unquestioningly following and aiding Flint through his travels; and Anderson, an NPC last in a long line of men of the same name and favorite explorer/cartographer of the queen, and the PC's guide. The group has set off into this unforgiving realm in a desperate attempt to find an unlikely pocket of dwarves at the behest of the Queen of Elysar, the last elf on the planet. Thought by most to have been wiped out a few centuries ago, the Queen has it in her head that a few survived and went into hiding in the remote mountain ranges of the Pearl. She intends to bring them back out into the world, repent for the actions of her people so long ago, and ask them to save her castle, the Golden Harbor (which was originally built and held by dwarves) from its imminent collapse into the Rhinewall ocean.\n\nFlash Forward!\n\nDespite years of expertise and study of the region and it's few native creatures, Anderson falls victim to the pole's apex predator, the Sevelod, after three days of monotonous dogsled travel across the frozen flatlands. The creature can be envisioned as a walrus or Skyrim's Horker, except that it is covered in fur that behaves much like a polar bears, its front limbs are flippers that each extend out in a four foot taper, and it boasts powerful hind legs. Sevelods are ambush creatures that hide either underwater or burrow into snowbanks, bursting from their cover to envelop their prey in a tight flipper burrito before biting off the victim's head.\n\nWith a surprising display of reflexes and no small bit of luck, Anderson is able to avoid capture, but is nevertheless knocked from his sled and smashed by the assailant's body weight, right through the surface of the frozen lake they had been on the past day and a half. The adventurers stare at the frigid water in shock, wanting to help but unwilling to risk freezing to death themselves. After several agonizing seconds, Anderson manages to stun the sevelod with a kick to the head before bursting to the surface bawling for help.\n\nDarek rushes to the edge of the ice, extending his spear and trying to haul Anderson onto the surface, but the weakened ice can't handle the strain. A large chunk snaps and tips, and Darek is forced to abandon the spear and Anderson and dive for stable ground before he too is submerged. In the background, Flint has extricated himself from the toppled sled Anderson had been driving, righted it, and led the dogs away from the danger to preserve their supplies.\n\nMeanwhile, Darek has inched forward to the water's edge once more, this time sliding on his belly to better distribute his weight. He draws out his staff and offers it to their shivering guide, and manages to get him out of the water before the sevelod can gather its wits and haul him under again. Chatya has retrieved her musket and loaded a shot, and sits on her and Darek's sled waiting for the monster to resurface as Flint hauls a pale and blue lipped Anderson from the hole, stripping off his sodden clothing as he goes. As Darek begins trying to coax his spear close enough to grab with his staff, the sevelod bursts forth from the water in search of its prey, and is promptly dropped by a headshot from Chatya.\n\nThe immediate danger nullified and Anderson now naked and exposed in the middle of a snowstorm, Flint gets a bright idea and barks at Darek to bring the sevelod's corpse over to the sleds, and to get out his sharpest knife. As Flint begins stuffing a now limp and droopy-eyed Anderson into the sled bundle of fur and wool, Darek slowly but surely hauls over the body and begins to slice into its belly as Chatya reloads and stands ready to cover them from further attack.\n\nSure enough, a few moments later the brave cartographer has been thoroughly Tauntaun'd. \n\nAs Flint is positioning the sevelod's innards around Anderson's face to avoid suffocation, the group hears distant noise, a strange mixture of bark, howl, and guttural growl. They decide the source is two more, drawn by the smell of blood, and prepare an ambush of their own. Leaving Anderson in the corpse as bait, Chatya guides both sleds away from the puddle melting the snow around it, keeping the snow drift between herself and the distant calls. Flint and Anderson head for the burrow the original sevelod had waited for them in, assuming that what was good enough for it should be good enough for them. Flint draws his blunderbuss and prepares a bundle of stolen forks, spoons, and red river stones as means of a welcome, as Darek breaks off a layer of ice from his spear and holds fast at Flint's side, trying to ignore the scent of feces emanating from the fresh pile at the back of the burrow.\n\nLong minutes pass, and Chatya finally spots movement in the distance. Two sevelods, heads and chests raised high as possible, are shunting themselves across the ice with explosive kicks of their hind legs. As they slide forward, a large pile of snow amasses in front of them, and they heave themselves over the obstruction with a graceless belly flop before repeating the process all over. She takes her time, focuses on the creature on the right, and takes a shot, managing to score on its left shoulder.\n\nWhen the shot rings out, Darek, anxious to join the fight, bursts from the burrow and looks about for a foe in reach. Realizing how far they have yet to go, he produces a large silver tea tray from his pack, a souvenir from a previous encounter in the castle he had refused to discard, and begins making his best attempt to reflect sunlight into the creature's eyes. Highly ineffective, the minor shine he is able to produce does little more than annoy the sevelods. Nevertheless, between the throbbing in its shoulder and the pesky glimmer off the tray the right one opts to faceplant and carry on that way, grinding forward in a pitiful but determined display. Chatya puts the animal out of its misery with another meticulously aimed shot.\n\nUnperterbed by the loss of its comrade, the final beast presses on, but as Chatya reloads, it flops onto a thinner portion of ice and disappears in a puff of powder and a few choice drops of water. Chatya breaks from the sights of her rifle, glances at the nearby hole, already beginning to freeze over once more, back to where her prey had last been, and shouts for Darek to take the reigns to the second sled.\n\nThe pair splits, Chatya heading farther northward, Darek south towards Flint, in an attempt to prevent a total loss of their food stuffs and tent wraps. Darek finds himself to be the unlucky one, as the sevelod's head bursts from the ice and snaps at his lead dog's legs, sending it into a panicked sprint directly toward the original ice break. He heaves on the reigns and manages to turn the team right, drifting the sled over the brink and grinding to a halt by its northwest edge. He abandons the sled and bolts straight at Flint, still waiting at the ready at the mouth of the burrow.\n\nAs he nears the threshold to the hideaway, the monster bursts from the ice where Darek's foot had been a split second ago, and he's forced to snatch his leg away from eager jaws as he dives low into the burrow. The creature rises and rises until it's full length is exposed, and Flint pulls the trigger. A cone of ruined silver and shattered red stone rockets forth inches over Darek's back and legs and peppers the airborne sevelod. Forks and fragments of rock embed themselves in the blubber of its underside, but the neck and face become a pulpy ruin, and the body slumps limply to the ice.\n\nThe trio regroups, and wedges the sleds together against the burrow hole, closing it off from the elements in a funnel by draping skins over the makeshift tunnel and blocking off the entrance with Anderson's grim sleeping bag. After extricating him from the corpse and rewrapping him in cleaner furs, Flint begins work on a small campfire, Chatya ushers the dogs into the shelter to further warm Anderson's poor bones, and Darek disappears into the storm in search of a corpse to skin...\n\nStay tuned for Part 2! Hope you enjoyed!",

        "text": "[After delivering an exploding keg to the Dirty Thong Inn](http://redd.it/2lr5em), I jumped up onto the stage to use some of my meager healing abilities to save the life of an injured dancer, only to be dragged off the stage by the owner.\n\nAs the owner recovered and tried to pull me off the stage, the rest of the patrons and performers alike took that as their cue to exit the inn as quickly as possible, most likely to find somewhere safer to spend the night.  I turned to face the furious little man and was able to calm him down after convincing him that I had no clue what was actually in the keg, which was true otherwise I would have never brought it inside.  Looking around the main room I see that it has emptied out with the exception of myself, my shady companion from the Dolphin, a rough looking mercenary and a man who insists on wearing a deep hooded robe, totally obscuring his face.  I turn my attention to the owner once more, just in time to see him struggle to lift his hefty frame up to sit on the edge of the stage just behind the bar.  He begins wailing about how he is ruined and how will he recover from this attack, when my roguish friend snaps him out of it with a proposal of revenge.  With that offer the innkeeper snaps out of self pity and enters a state that can only be described as a vengeful fury.  He begins demanding to know who was responsible for the attack and he began offering a reward to whomever could \"Make that bitch pay.\"  I let slip that it was the owner of the Lucky Dolphin, Erix the Half-Elf.  My rogue companion gives me what I have to assume is a dirty look from under his hood before launching into his proposal that the two of us will deal with that miserable bitch for only the low low price of 100 gold, and a stripper.  Taken aback by the outrageous sum of money he asked for, the innkeeper said he would be willing to pay 50 gold up front and provide the stripper, with the final 50 gold being paid out upon completion of the job.  Reluctantly we accept the job and wait while our new employer fetches an appropriate girl to accompany us.  While he is out of the room, I introduce myself to my companion as Kain, and he says that his name is Turel, but I think that that may just be a fake name given how quickly he agrees to do less than reputable things.  I quickly ask Turel to explain his plan, which was basically to fake the death of the stripper in the Dolphin, have everyone run screaming out of the tavern at which point I was supposed to come in and impersonate a town guardsman and recover the \"Corpse\".  I immediately express my disgust with the plan, as well as some very well founded doubts as to the odds of this actually working given that we were both known to the owner of the Dolphin.  At this point, the mercenary at the other end of the bar offered to kill the dumb bitch for a quite larger sum of money, however we had no intention of just killing her, that would be too risky and also too short lived.  We were much more of a mind to embarrass and run the business into the ground.  The mercenary reluctantly agreed and offered to help us with the job for a cut of the reward, and followed Turel, Turel's new stripper friend (provided by the generous owner of the Dirty Thong), and myself out of the bar.  However we had picked up another tail, following us in the shadows.  \n\nI let Turel and the mercenary get ahead of me, as I walked slower and slower.  Eventually the shadow crept close enough to me, so I reached out and grabbed it by the throat, demanding to know what it was doing following me.  It choked out a reply that was so unintelligible I realized I was cutting off the thing's windpipe, and thus its ability to speak coherently.  I throw the thing back from me, and that is when I recognize the shadow as the sinister looking patron of the Dirty Thong that didn't run out screaming with the rest of the crowd.  At this point, the shady little man offers to execute the owner of the Dolphin for us, because stealthy kills were his specialty apparently.  I, for the second time that night, explain that we want to embarrass her, not kill her.  After it became clear that I would not be able to shake the man, I begin my walk to catch up with Turel, however Turel and his group have gone completely out of sight.  I hurry to catch up with them, but I have wasted quite a few minutes already in dealing with this new arrival.  As we approach the doors of the Lucky Dolphin, it appears that Turel has already thought of something because everyone is rushing out of the Dolphin and into the streets in a panic.  I am about to enter when two things become apparent.  First, I smell smoke.  Second, I actually catch what one of the patrons is screaming as he exits the building; FIRE OH GODS ITS A FIRE! \nI scan the crowd for Turel and the mercenary, but all I see is his stripper.  As I turn to run into the burning inn, I see Turel come out one of the side doors, with a few very expensive wine bottles in hand.  Flagging him down, he comes over to where I am standing with the stripper and the sneaky fellow.  He attempts to get the girl to stand with him and watch the inn burn down, but she is extremely reluctant, saying something about how we should be helping put out the fires or rescuing the people left inside.  With a few well placed words, namely \"This is the bitch that had the exploding keg delivered\" and the stripper was soon knocking back some of the recently freed wine with Turel and cheering as the Dolphin burned merrily to the ground.  I heard a bard on the other side of the crowd playing a stringed instrument of some sort, and missing my days as a youth playing the drums at camp, I go to introduce myself to this bard.  As she comes into view, I notice that she is a very attractive and busty little halfling.  In between songs I ask her if she happens to have any drums and if she would mind if I joined her performance on the drums.  She agreed but made it clear that she would not be splitting any profit with me.  So the two of us sat there and played, watching as the Dolphin burned for a few songs.  As I get up, I ask the halfling if she would like to join us as we walk back to the Dirty Thong.  She agrees and packs up her instruments before following us.  \n\nAs we approach the Dirty Thong, I notice that the mercenary from earlier was nowhere to be found.  Figuring that he had split while the Dolphin was burning.  We push open the doors to find that the main room of the Thong is still pretty empty, only two figures were inside: The innkeeper and our missing companion, the mercenary.  Upon seeing us, the innkeeper flashes us a nervous smile and thanks us for our services in dealing with Erix.  Our looks of confusion must have been evident because at this point he explained that our companion, the mercenary had come back shortly after leaving, claiming that he had trashed the wine and other supplies in the cellar, shortly before starting a small fire to scare away the patrons.  Again, the looks on our faces must have betrayed us, because the innkeeper was asking us what was wrong.  When we told him how the fire had spiraled out of control he immediately paled and started to stammer out that we had been paid and that we should leave as soon as possible, and thanks but no thanks don't come back.  With a final drink we were ushered from the inn, thus making it not one but two inns that we could no longer frequent in this town, and only on our first night.\n\nFiguring that the third time is the charm, our rag tag group of apparent blackmailers, thieves and arsonists heads to the only remaining inn standing, so to speak.  It is shorty after making a deal with the innkeeper of the Gambler's Coin that the Halfling Bard, (who I learn is called Angelica) and I set up her violin and drums, playing to reduce the cost of our rooms for the night.  After playing for a few hours and attracting in some more patrons, Angelica and I settle up with the innkeeper and turn in for the night, leaving Turel with the mercenary (who I had since learned was called Alistair) and the other hooded companion (who I am told is known as Gerald) watching a high stakes poker game in the common room of the inn.  We briefly make plans to meet the next morning and then I bid them a good night.  \n\nWhen I wake the next morning I hear quite a bit of gossip about the rivalry between the inns, the most notable being the fire at the Dolphin, some mentions of the explosion at the Thong, but by far the most concerning to me is news that shortly after I had turned in, someone had robbed the Coin blind, with a whole room full of people no less.  \n\nComing soon:  Part 3:  The Aftermath and Other Random Bullshit Around Town",

        "text": "Dusk approaches.  I finish my prayers to Kord at the small shrine near the edge of town before heading in further to find lodging for the night.  This bustling town seems to have quite the night life, dominated by the three inns that seem to be in perpetual competition with each other.  The first, and seemingly most reputable establishment is known as The Lucky Dolphin.  It's closest competitor would be the Gambler's Coin, right across the street, a somewhat rough and tumble tavern well known for hosting games of chance and fortune.  The third and final inn was know by the charming name of \"The Dirty Thong\".  As one might guess, a weary adventurer could find the solace of a beautiful entertainer within its walls.. For a price that is.  Figuring that The Lucky Dolphin would be my safest choice (and cleanest as well) I head down the street, taking in the slowly fading sunlight, quickly replaced by the dull glow of the street lamps that dotted both sides of the path.  I push my way through the doors of the Dolphin and almost immediately I catch sight of a miserable looking Half-Elf woman in deep conversation with a hooded figure near the bar.  I sit down not too far from them, ordering a simple meal of potato soup as I take in the muted sounds of the fine establishment around me.  I can hear the Half-Elf and the Hooded Man fairly well from where I sit, and for the most part it is just the banal gossip that is spread like a plague around town, mostly focusing upon the continuing feud between the three inns and their \"competition\" to drive their competitors out of business and secure a firm hold over the constant stream of adventurers flowing through town on their way to one of the surrounding big cities.  \n\nAs I sat listening to the odd couple talk, they quickly changed topic and it became apparent that the woman was none other than the owner of the Dolphin, and on top of that, she was offering to pay the strange man to deliver a \"lost\" keg of beer to one of her competitors, the Dirty Thong to be specific.  After a bit of haggling the stranger agreed to deliver the package, but something within me pulled at me, making me believe that there was something more going on with that package.  While the man went to retrieve the keg, I questioned the Half-Elf, asking her why she would be so willing to help her competitor.  With a knowing wink she told me that it was just a simple misunderstanding and that she had simply gotten the wrong shipment a few days ago and that she had just noticed earlier that day that it was in her store room.  I quickly asked her what made the brew so special and as she fumbled her words to explain what it was (She said it was an exotic southern dwarf brew known as the Skidmark) I sensed that she was lying and took that opportunity to pressure her into admitting that she was up to no good.  She attempted to bribe me with gold, and in a moment of weakness, I accepted.  However almost instantly my conscience (or maybe my own greed) forced me out the door after the strange man, to ensure that he knew exactly what he was being drawn into.  \n\nA quick conversation revealed that he knew that it was not likely to actually contain the fine ale that it was supposed to be carrying, but he was very open to making a profit by turning on the \"miserable Half-Elf\" woman.  We walked together to the Dirty Thong, intent on wringing a reward from the owner by informing him that the keg that we had with us was intended for him, but also that it was from one of his competitors in an attempt to sabotage his business.  \n\nAs an aside, to explain the atmosphere of both the Dolphin and the Thong and how vastly different they were in both decoration and theme.  Where the Dolphin served exclusively high class and vintage wine, the Thong served all manner of ales, stouts and even a not so modest amount of other liquors.  Where the Dolphin prided itself on a high class atmosphere and refined decorative tastes, the Thong had a stage the wrapped around the outer wall of the inn where scantily clad women of mostly human or half-elf descent danced for tips.\n\nThat said, as the owner of the Thong, a squat fat man, leaned over to examine the keg, it detonated, flinging shards of wood and debris all over the bar.  The majority of the blast was contained by the fact that it was behind the bar, and that the owner and I were standing over it at the time, yet one stray shard did manage to impale one of the dancers, striking her soft exposed flesh and piercing her lungs.  I quickly recovered and rushed to her aid, removing the shard and stabilizing her wounds long enough for her to be moved to see a true healer.  \n\nAs the owner recovered, he quickly dragged me off of the stage and began demanding to know what the hell was going on...",

        "text": "So I'm playing in a new campaign, I'm playing a brain damaged fighter named Glory (based on the character Glory from JourneyQuest because my party hasn't watched it yet). He was cast out of the paladin training because torm would not grant him his power. He is now living according to the tenants he learned. Like always kill evil creatures. And that orcs are frequently evil. He put that together as \"Always kill creatures that are usually evil like orcs. So he was jailed for killing an innocent shop keeper orc which is where the campaign begins. \n\nWith him, in a cell with an orc npc. First thing he does? Kill the sleeping orc barbarian For Honor. So he kills a lvl 5 barbarian orc as a lvl 2 fighter. He had surprise round as orc was sleeping and another as he got up.\n\nLater on he becomes the party guinea pig as they realize he has no self preservation instincts. Like when they got the keys and were breaking out he thought it must be yard time.Then they were talking about killing the guards and to convince him to join in they said it was a game, and it is rec time. To win the game do what the dwarf does. they then sneak up and bum rush the guards and kill them. During the fight the dwarf smashed a chair over one guard which Glory thought was cheating until the dwarf told him it's allowed and tossed him a chair leg. Glory decided it should be an honorable fight and keeps punching (had leg in hand but kept using the fist). Afterwards the dwarf tells him the guards' armor is their team uniforms and they should put it on. \n\nFast forward awhile\n\nWe come across a wall with glyphs on it. none of us can read it and of course glory only speaks common. He is illiterate so he begins making noises trying to read until he believes it is a vegan restaraunt menu. He then wanders off looking for a place he can get a real meal when no one is looking at him. After they solve it and track him down they have to convince him the vegan restaurant is making an exception for him and becoming a steak house after seeing the error of their ways and he gets the first steak.\n\nWhen he gets in the room there is a massive golden chest. Glory assumes steak is inside the chest, but cannot open the lid. He immediately decides to pick up and smash the chest. The DM began describing how it was massive, like 10'x5'x3' of gold and jewels. While he is describing I roll a nat 20 and lift and smash. inside was a person so Glory pushed the guy out and looked for the steak and was sorely upset when there was no steak in the chest. \n\nThat's roughly where it ended.\n\nIf you want to follow http://www.twitch.tv/2good4hisowngood you can follow the adventures of Glory and friends.",

        "text": "So today our party had one of the strangest attempts at diplomatic negotiations I've ever heard of and I thought this subreddit might enjoy it.  Currently our party is running through Rise of the Runelords, and we are working through Book 4 (minor spoilers ahead for those who care).  Our party members are a dwarven monk, an elven wizard, a catfolk ninja, and finally the star of our story, a dwarven cleric named Harsk.  We are currently infiltrating (or more accurately attacking violently and then teleporting away) a fortress controlled by several different kinds of giants.  Having encountered one of the giant's elders, she asks us to help her kill the warlord that is forming them into an army, and requests that we do not kill any more of her people if we can help it. \n\nAfter a brief encounter with a few ogre lackeys and a crazed kobold we come across the armory of the fortress, where we know a few slaves the giants have taken are being held.  As rescuing two of these individuals (who happen to be nobility) is part of our current job we need to deal with this particular room and ensure the nobles are safe.  Inside the forge are two giants working on weaponry and the handful of slaves kept in cages along the walls.  As we abandoned subtlety before we even entered the fortress (our first fight in the fortress courtyard we started by causing a stampede of mammoths) we walk straight into the room and the two workers turn to meet us immediately.\n\nHowever Harsk informs them that we don't want to fight them.  The two stop, and ask first how we even knew how to get to this room in the first place.  At which point Harsk immediately reveals our informant.  The two workers are shocked by this news, but since we have said we didn't want to fight they simply look at each other then ask if they can go.  Realizing his mistake in revealing the informant Harsk asks if they intend to hurt the elder in any way (sense motive).  They do not.  Harsk asks them if they are going to tell the warlord about this (sense motive again), they don't answer.  Then Harsk asks if they want to help us kill the warlord, which stuns them into mild shock.  Harsk responds to this by taking his warhammer and hitting the first giant in the groin.  At this point combat logically starts, and the ninja (my own character) kills the second giant with sneak attacks (I swear I didn't think he would die instantly).  Our monk then flurries against the remaining giant suffering from bruised genitalia, pummeling him not quite into the ground.\n\nThe giant, now barely conscious and having seen his friend collapse dead, calls out Harsk for lying about not wanting to fight.  Harsk then mid combat asks the surviving giant why he is working for the warlord, then runs over to the fallen giant and revives it with Breath of Life.  Now both giants, incredibly confused and more than slightly terrified at this unconventional questioning method attempt to force their way out of the room, and are promptly knocked out, as the elder did ask us not to kill more of her people.\n\nSo in order of diplomacy we:\n1) Say we don't wish to fight\n2) Reveal our secret informant who will likely be killed like the other elders have been for disobedience\n3) Try to see if the workers will act on this information to harm her\n4) Request these two underlings help to KILL their boss\n5) Before they can really answer attack them\n6) After killing one, ask the survivor why he is working for the warlord, then revive the dead one, then knock them both unconscious\n\nOur DM wasn't exactly pleased with our diplomatic efforts.\n\nEDIT: Words",

        "text": "[A continuing tale of my first pathfinder character, Takrov the drunken russian midget.](http://redd.it/2lk8ec) For those of you who weren't here last time, Tarkov and his lovely comrades (consisting of a naive female monk, a pissy dragon sorceress, an incredibly unlucky cavalier, a trigger-happy hobgoblin gunner, and a sexually frustrated kitsune ninja) had just declared war on the BBEG demigod Fester and charged headlong into his lair. Or, Tarkov had. His comrades were standing around, trying to act all brooding and serious in the wake of a screaming russian midget who had just *charged headlong into a den of evil while spewing a stream of insults*. Eventually they decided they should probably follow him in before he got himself killed.\n\nAs we all crossed the pitch-black border, some freaky dimensional shit happened and we found ourselves at the entrance to a massive labyrinth. Tarkov, having arrived first, was pounding his puny gnome fist against a large arrow labeled \"FREE BOOZE\" and swearing up a storm, cursing Fester and his bullshit. The party tried to get Tarkov to calm down, but he just wouldn't. Fester might have been the reason for multiple dead family and friends of all the rest of the party, but he had done something much worse to Tarkov- *he had dared to steal his booze*. There are very few forces that can restrain a surly russian who's slowly becoming sober.\n\nFortunately, the labyrinth was filled with monsters, so there was an easy outlet for some murderhobo rage. We fought souped-up versions of old miniboss monsters, mostly from too early in the campaign for Tarkov to recognize. We even fought an enemy cavalier, who was some sort of dark counterpart to our own or something. He had a thing for rideby attacks, so Tarkov waited until he was turning around and summoned [a horde of screeching monkeys](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mad-monkeys) on top of his horse. We all laughed and threw things at him as he tried furiously to hack away all of the screeching simians... but in the end, he was [brought under and torn apart by the unending flood](http://sta.sh/02005g2npopu). Good times.\n\nFurther along, we encountered a liquored-up hillbilly wielding a keg as a flail (a boss from our time in the weird-ass prison arena). Tarkov immediately took every opportunity to disarm the idiot and liberate the keg of precious booze. As soon as he had a spare round, Tarkov drank it. All of it. In a round. Despite the fact that it was both shitty booze and *twice Tarkov's size*. After a rushed Heimlich maneuver and a quick whale impersonation, Tarkov was back in business.\n\nAnd the first order of business was *FUCK THIS MAZE*. Can your flimsy doom-walls withstand a pointblank greater shout? DIDN'T THINK SO.\n\nThis irked Festeros. Apparently he had built the entire thing just for us, and watching us just demolish it instead of trying to find our way to the end was a bit frustrating, so he sent another horde of miniboss monsters at us. But out in the open with the new and improved Tarkov 2.0 'singing' for the party, they didn't even touch us. The damage a gunner can do with two guns, a full attack and a +6 bonus from a bardic performance is truly absurd.\n\nThat taken care of, we walked into a glowy circle arena and challenged Festeros to a throwdown. Well, he still wasn't done screwing with us, and threw some REAL boss-monsters our way- a greatest hits version of the campaign to this point. There were no speeches, we just got straight to the murdering.\n\nSadly, there were four of them and only two real melee fighters on our team. Tarkov ended up having a brief battle with a monster called Monolith, who had killed the pissy sorceress's mother and now proceeded to tear off Tarkov's face. Like, surgically. Tarkov was packing a lot of Cure Critical Wounds spells, though, so he was fine. Less so when he suddenly found himself [Plane Shifted](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plane-shift) to the elemental plane of fire. But Tarkov knew [Shadow Evocation](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/shadow-evocation), so he just popped into a [Resilient Sphere](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/resilient-sphere) while he burned through his low-level healing magic. Really, he was safer there than the rest of the party, but they understandably wanted their awesome drunken screaming damage bonus back, so they got the sorceress to reverse the spell after a few rounds.\n\nWhen we finally finished with those chuckleheads, the lights dimmed and Tarkov made a [series of ranged touch attacks](http://fav.me/d7g3gac), bringing everyone back to pretty good condition. Then, we were finally confronted by Fester himself. And his buddies, Fester, Fester, and Fester. Each incarnation looked a bit different- one was the [demonic rapeclown we all knew and loved](http://i.imgur.com/K8g8ulp.png), one was a paladin, one was an antipaladin, and one was this weird hovering glowy dude. The battle began, and everyone chose a target and charged forward. The gunner, ninja and sorceress went after the antipaladin, the cavalier went after the paladin, the monk went after the glowy dude, Tarkov started reciting his list of insults at the jester (who immediately fled onto a loop of spiked chain hanging from the ceiling and began harassing us with throwing daggers).\n\nThe antipaladin front was surprisingly straightforward, as our sorceress had pumped a lot of power into her fire breath attacks and the gunner was dodging every attack that came his way. Our cavalier was matching the paladin blow for blow, and was looking pretty good right up until the paladin fucker used some twisted healing magic to make the cavalier's leg explode (he died, but got better). With that, everyone put aside their fights for a round to turn that dickwad paladin into an unpleasant stain on the ground. Asshole.\n\nOur monk was also having difficulties. Her opponent, the floating glowy dude, was also a monk and was actually starting to kick her ass. [A timely interference from Tarkov](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/thundering-drums) bought her the time she needed to regain the upper hand while the floating glowy dude \"fell prone\" without touching the floor. It was a bit like watching a gyroscope, only with more vomit. This didn't last, though, and the glowy dude used some sort of super ki power bullshit to get himself some breathing room. So Tarkov summoned a swarm of monkeys on his ass.\n\nBut the monkeys had had enough of Tarkov's bullshit- every time he summoned them they were used as cannon fodder and died in droves while people threw things at them. Well, not this time! They charged TARKOV, stole his bag of holding, and screeched their way into the sunset as the surly russian cursed and shook his fist at them. And then the monkeys accidentally shattered one of the bottles of alchemist's fire in the bag.\n\nThere were about twenty in there, total.\n\nThe monk was scorched, the glowy dude was scorched, and Tarkov was scorched, and our gunner barely dodged a giant spear on a ballistic trajectory (Tarkov had been saving that for a special occasion), but everyone was more or less alright... up until the monk used the surprise of the situation to go fist of the north star on the glowy dude, who made his best Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robot impersonation. We then stomped the antipaladin out of existence while the jester laughed and sarcastically applauded us. We weren't done yet.\n\nFester gave a short speech that Tarkov wasn't really paying attention to and morphed into a horrible 100-foot-tall monster with a body composed of rotting corpses and a glowing sun-skull for a face. We cast our most powerful buffs, summoned a slew of creatures to assist us, and the melee fighters charged the bastard's face with the help of a flight spell while everyone else took cover behind some inexplicable pillars.\n\nFester's first move annihilated most of the health of everyone in the open, killing our summons and sending the monk into the negatives. He never got to make a second. Between the cavalier's dumbass charge, the monk's enraged flurry of blows, the gunner's bard-powered rapid shot, the sorceress's ultimate magic attack, and Tarkov's own homebrewed ultra-scream, we turned that bastard's brain into an unpleasant spatter. With a lurch, the abomination disintegrated and the battle was won.\n\nExcept, there was still a glowing voldemort-style fetus thing lying on the ground at our feet, cursing us and swearing vengeance.\n\nTarkov strode up and fatefully unzipped his pants, taking careful aim...\n\nAnd then the fetus thing's arms sprouted into grabby tentacles and started strangling the entire party at once. The gunner struggled free, and fired a special gun into the fetus thing's brain- it was a [black hole bullet](http://youtu.be/bTTg7jBfHlw) that he had personally collaborated with Sean Connery to build, and he was too close to have a chance of escaping its effect. We almost were, too, but the monk barely managed to stop it from expanding using some interdimensional Ki bullshit and a couple of superfluous fingers.\n\nA disappointed Tarkov re-zipped his pants and solemnly picked up the gunner's hat.\n\nFarewell, comrade.\n\nAnd like that, it was over. Fester's little demiplane collapsed on itself and spat us back into the normal world, more or less intact. The zombie clown armies had gone brain-dead, and we were promptly picked up by Cap'n Connery and stuck in the trauma ward while a bunch of nurses fussed over us (they had to restrain Tarkov after he broke into the medicine cabinet and tried to drink some pure alcohol). We told Sean what had happened, and he thanked us for our assistance in saving the world.\n\nWe rolled up endings for each of the characters. Tarkov returned to his village with an artifact that would probably solve its heating problem forever- a goblin fire drum that produced heat and started small fires when struck. The pissy dragon sorceress went back to the dragon village to become the sovereign queen. Our monk returned to her mentor (who was alive, minus a hand) and started her own dojo. Our ninja went back to his home, but got screwed over by a bad stealth roll and accidentally revealed his hometown's location to a group of murderzealots who killed everyone. Despondent, he crashed on the monk's couch for an indeterminate number of years.\n\nAnd the cavalier. Oh god, the cavalier... He failed a charisma roll and *almost* never found a wife. But he eventually did, in about his mid-50s, and was happy for many years as a wealthy baron... until a magical superzombie plague struck the continent, his wife got infected and he tried to rush her to a healer... only for her to turn in his hands and tear his throat out. That fucking guy could never catch a break...\n\nTarkov's future is more uncertain. While he did return to his village for a time, gnomes are infamously easy to bore, and he once again set off to roam the world in a drunken stupor. He ended up running into his old pal Sean Connery, and they chummed it up over some booze that could probably kill a level 1 commoner with smell alone. He got a job as one of Sir Connery's top field agents, and continued his murderhobo adventures driven by greed and boredom. But it looks like he'll be showing up again in our current campaign...\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Who writes this crap\", GARAAD THE DITZY NINJA!](http://redd.it/2m1uqg)\n\n[FOR MORE TARKOV, TRY LOOKING IN THE BAR!

        "text": "[A continuing tale of my first pathfinder character, Tarkov the drunken russian midget.](http://redd.it/2lb2l7) For those of you who weren't here last time, Tarkov and his merry band of murderhobos (consisting of a naive female monk, a pissy dragon sorceress, an incredibly unlucky cavalier, and a trigger-happy hobgoblin gunner) had just humiliated an incredibly powerful dracolich by punching it in the soul with a giant windup robot. Congratulations were in order from the floating dragon island we had just saved, and our pissy sorceress was lauded as a hero for saving everyone and was subsequently named heir to the dragon throne and given the keys to the city and earned the approval of her dead mother who had been resurrected specifically for this event and also she got married to her totally hot dragon boyfriend CAN WE GO NOW OR WHAT.\n\nWith all that taken care of, our fearless leader Sean Connery dragged us all back onto the airship and we set off for home. Unfortunately, all was not well, and our recurring villain Fester was appearing to the non-Tarkov people and mocking them with all the friends and relatives that had died while gloating about his upcoming return. Also, Tarkov *still* hadn't made good on his promise to take the monk out to dinner. That just wouldn't do.\n\nWell, right in the middle of the world's booziest [Heroes' Feast](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heroes-feast), our airship was suddenly impacted by another airship. We were being attacked by a small band of drow air-pirates with the aim of seizing the vessel and murdering everyone aboard, because apparently drows don't try very hard to go against stereotypes. Unfortunately for them, they were trying to take over a vessel that was inhabited by a level 20 monk and the world's screamiest bard. The idiots didn't stand a chance.\n\nTheir captain might have, though- she was a giant spider-lady with some sweet weaponry and her own personal battleground. But then, she was up agasint a monk with [Quivering Palm](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk#TOC-Quivering-Palm-Su-), so it was basically less of a battle and more of a very painful, roundabout method of suicide.\n\nWe even showed mercy, too. After the palm landed, our monk took great pains to [explain the situation](http://i.imgur.com/kwifQyh.jpg), but she wasn't having it and lashed out with her Keen Acid Scimitars, scoring a critical hit on the monk's throat. And with that, we were all out of mercy (but not healing spells, the monk recovered just fine).\n\nThat done, we headed back into the ship and explained to our other comrades that no, you do not get to mute the shipwide alert so that you can get more sleep, and no, we weren't sharing the huge stockpile of gold we had pilfered. Then we got some much-needed rest.\n\nFor our monk, this consisted of some face-time with Fester culminating in being molested by the severed hand of her former mentor. For Tarkov, this consisted of Fester fruitlessly trying to get Tarkov to let slip about his hometown and uncertain past (which Tarkov never, ever did for any reason). For the first time, Fester was actually at a loss- he may have been an evil demigod, but he wasn't omniscient, and fucking NOBODY knew exactly where the hell Tarkov had hailed from, so he couldn't go down and rapemurder all of Tarkov's loved ones or taunt him with the horrific events of his past (*if there were any*, because who could tell?).\n\nSo instead, he took away *every last bit of Tarkov's vodka*.\n\nAfter three shipwide searches confirmed that there wasn't a drop left, Tarkov went nuclear. This creepy clown fuck was going to **DIE**.\n\nBut the trouble was, we had no freaking clue where to look for a murderous evil demigod. It wasn't like you could just knock on his door. We asked Cap'n Sean Connery for help, and he ~~bitched at everyone for not helping with all of the freaking repairs that needed to be done, this shit is expensive and it's coming out of your paychecks~~ told us the secret truth about Fester. Turns out that Festeros had been around for a long time, was probably immortal, and Sean himself had tried to lay the smackdown on him once or twice. Now, Sean was Captain Saint Badass in our campaign, and was practically immortal in his own right, but Festeros hadn't been killed in their confrontation, just banished. That wasn't enough for us. We wanted this fucker DEAD.\n\nWe all made preparations for our final battle. The pissy dragon sorceress called in a favor from her gold dragon grandpappy to get her hands on a spell of immense magical power, the monk trained fastidiously in the art of punching things in the face so hard they explode, the cavalier made some adjustments to his weapons and armor, the gunner sealed himself in a room with Cap'n Connery to discuss some specialized gun ammunition, and Tarkov made a list of colorful insults to call Festeros and brooded about how he was actually SOBER for once in his life.\n\nWhen we finally arrived home at the floating continent of Nuvo, we could already see that shit was going down. Festeros had declared war on living creatures, it seemed, and was swarming everything with an unending army of zombie clowns that kept chanting our names. We found out where they were coming from, flew in, and started wrecking as much shit as possible. We had survived an encounter with a freaking goblin army, but this was something else. There were so many clown mooks that the DM had to treat them as swarms. So we stabbed and fireballed and screamed and blasted and punched our way through wave after wave of the little shits, each one stronger than the last, until we finally reached the rape-pit that Festeros was hiding in.\n\nOur group stood at the edge of the pitch-black cave mouth, solemnly pondering the seriousness of the situation... except for Tarkov, who immediately charged in with tiny electric axe a mighty scream of \"FUCK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!\"\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Send in the clowns\", OLD FRIENDS AND OVERDUE GOODBYES!](http://redd.it/2lminy)",

        "text": "Continued from [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2lc8cr/dungeon_world_the_beginning_story_ive_wanted_to/)\n\n(Going to take a moment to explain Dungeon World dice rolling just in case. For everything expect for damage you roll 2d6+ the relevant ability modifier. 10+ is a full success, you do what you set out to do no problem. 7-9 is a partial success, you do most of what you intended but there’s a catch that comes up. 6- is a failure. Bad things happen. Certain class abilities involve rolling a 12+, where you do really cool and awesome things thought for this game we have a house rule. 2 6’s is a crit success where you do the full effect of what you wanted and the GM throws a cool bonus on the side or fun flavour to your action that makes you look cooler.)\n\nAfter a little trouble getting through the gates of Dungeon World (because we let the goddamn friendship monster try to talk his way in. First lesson, he is not allowed to speak for the party,) we strode into the city with high hopes for future endeavors. Right off the bat we got front row seats to a man being beaten and tossed off a 60-80 foot drop.\n\nNot exactly a great introduction to the place but probably the most accurate.\n\nWe learned really quickly the bosses of this floor where the 1st Tier Saints. I can’t remember what the GM actually wanted to call them but one offhand Saints Row joke cemented their identity for the party. We had spent most of the day trying to get into the place so rather than jumping into the pits with no care for the consequences we decided to find a place to rest.\n\nWhich is where we ran into our first problem. Everybody was dirt poor with one exception. See in this system most classes start out with what they have on their back, some armour, a weapon, some food, that’s it. As a Thief, I had some pretty weak weapons, leather armour, some general adventuring gear, AND 10 WHOLE GOLD COINS.\n\nSo while Fenfaril, Half-Dan, and the friendship monster found a nice, less crowded alleyway to bunker down in, Faye used her whole fortune to get one week at a 1st Tier inn. Siegfried had it easier than the other three using his stunning good looks and bardic abilities to convince the innkeeper I stayed with to hire him. A roof over your head and all you have to do is what you love for an hour or so at night? Pretty sweet deal.\n\nStaying at this fine establishment also taught us a bit about how the 1st Tier Saints operated. They pretty much owned every business on this level and if you wanted to buy a house, start a business you needed to be part of their circle, or else you’d get a similar treatment to the first guy we watched get tossed to 2nd Tier. You could pick them out pretty easily since their main colour was neon yellow and they always wore copious amounts of bling. Finally, every one of them had a bandana marking them as a true member of the gang. If you were a part of the gang or a noted friend living in 1st tier was easy. Faye and later Kaisus meshed best with this group since once you got how they talked and acted approaching them was perfectly natural. You just need to open the conversation with anything like, “Sup bro, kill and commies yet?” and you were golden.\n\nBack to the story, we agreed when we split up last night to meet up in the morning by the mines. Our first “adventure” is when we learned the second great lesson for this party. Siegfried is not allowed to read maps. We followed a tunnel he pointed out which, unbeknownst to us had recently caved in. This was marked on a map Siegfried found with a large red X. Think he said something like “There’s probably treasure! And look how few people are going into it!”\n\nWe made our way through the dark mine shaft until we hit a lovely dead end with no traces of even one gold coin to take. Distraught at our initial luck we resolved to hit up a better tunnel and strike it rich. Well, the only thing that ended up striking us an arrow from the shadows. I took the first hit of the game and since I prefer my characters dexterous over able to take a hit I was down 1/3 of my health off the bat. \n\nTurns you we were the suckers of the day for a group of thugs looking to loot what they could from us. Unfortunately for them if there’s one word I’d use to describe the party even when 3/5th of it changed is vengeful. We do not forgive, we do not show mercy, and if you slight us we will make convoluted plans that take 2 hours or longer then scream fuck it and rush you down. We skipped the two hours part this time and just settled with the rush, kill, loot style.\n\nStill, we got a fair share of damage on our side. If we were rational people we would have called it a day and left to heal up. Instead we charged deeper in, this time in the right direction. After a few minutes of walking down we came to the main area where all the mines connected to and diverged from. \n\nIt was a massive hall, as big as 2 or 3 football fields placed beside each other. There was the main center platform where stalls selling anything you could have needed in the mines, to the back where we came in ran two large stone staircases leading to a bottom area surrounding this platform where people seemed to be resting up and preparing for the ordeals ahead. Finally, running along the walls and even some parts of the floor were doors with little number plates above them. There must have been hundreds or thousands of them (kinda wished I checked to see exactly how many there were but oh well) and each led to a different mine, ruin, or cave system. Hence the World part of the Dungeon World, this place was a massive, sprawling underground pit of death waiting for fools to leap into its arms.\nNaturally we picked a random door and went for it.\n\nAfter walking for a while through a damp, dark cave we reached an underground lake that revealed a fatal flaw in our characters and our party composition. As I mention above, I’m a fan of dexterity. I like to run, dodge, and backflip with the best of them, also because the DM for the Pathfinder campaign I was in (my first campaign) threw acrobatics checks, reflex saves, and general DODGE moments at us pretty often. So I like being able to get out of the way as easily and quickly as possible.\n\nNow, for the rest of the party, our Spellslinger relied on dex to shoot magic like a revolver and reasoned he wouldn’t need that much constitution since he’d be away from fights. Our Wizard had the same mentality. And friendship guy I don’t even know but it wasn’t great.\n\nBasically to hold your breath underwater you need to roll 2d6+CON after a while to not die. That meant Faye and Fenfaril would be taking -1, while Half-Dan and friendship monster would have to roll with no bonus. The only person who felt confident in his swimming abilities was Siegfried, who was fully willing to leap in alone.\nHere’s where the fatal flaw of our characters comes in. Nestled at the bottom of the lake was a glimmering gold weapon that Fenfaril could clearly tell was magic. A combination of greed, desire for a tale to tell, and curiosity of the arcane prompted us to investigate further.\n\nSo here we were, five of us discussing potential ways to get to this weapon without having to get our feet wet. Siegfried gets impatient with our plotting and declares:\n\n“Enough talk! It’s time for action!”\n\nIt wasn’t as simple for him as that, before leaping into action he first had to remove his armour. Then his clothes. All of them. His rational being something along the lines of swimming is hard in amour, and I don’t want to get my clothes wet.\n\nFair enough I guess. We all had a laugh at it while he dived in and worked his way to the weapon. We stopped laughing when we saw the grin slowly growing across our GM’s face. As Siegfried made his way through a particularly dense patch of seaweed it suddenly started wrapping around him, and a failed defy danger roll left him grappled the bottom of a lake.\n\nSo here we were, four of us discussing potential ways to save our comrade from drowning and becoming fertilizer for a particularly grabby patch of seaweed. Faye’s best idea was to stroke Half-Dan’s ego until he manned up and went for the rescue. It wasn’t the worst idea I’ve had, until he got grappled as well. The friendship monster dove down to try to do something at the least, leaving Faye and Fenfaril alone with the awkward thought of trying to dredge up 3 soggy bodies.\n\nUnlike the other two, that thing actually succeeded on his rolls and managed to get Half-Dan out, before they both moved down to save a drowning Siegfried. Together they saved him from a watery grave, but that wasn’t good enough. No, we weren’t leaving empty handed. In a feat of heroic strength and physical might Siegfried pushed past the weeds, grasped the sword, and swum the hell out of there.\n\nTwo of us could have died, but we got the treasure we sought after. Only under closer inspection, the Wizard realized it was just a wooden sword that was enchanted to look gold. Two people nearly died, to pull up a glorified piece of driftwood.\n\nLike I just said, we were not leaving empty handed. We had to go deeper.\n\n[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2liqoe/dungeon_world_our_first_adventure_goes_as_well_as/clv5fwc) in the comments",
