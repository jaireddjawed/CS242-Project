Would you like to accompany me to the beverage dispenser in order to stretch our motile appendages?”\n\nHuman Friend O’Leary twitched sudden at Trs’kts’s voice but glanced down at him with a strained smile.\n\n“Sure Trs’kts,” he said as his hands flew over the control panel, closing out his program and shutting down his computer.\n\nTrs’kts wondered at that. So far every human he had seen in a professional situation took the time to completely lock down the terminal they were on before they left it even for a short time. The behavior seemed rather unnecessary and wasteful of time, but it was not what had the Trisk concerned today.\n\nThe human finished the task and leaned back in his chair. He indulged in a period of prolonged, slow movement where he extended and contracted symmetrical muscle groups to their full extent before standing. The humans called it stretching and it seemed necessary to their muscle function.  Then the human extended his hand for Trs’kts to walk out on.\n\n“So how are you feeling this work cycle?” Trs’kts asked as he settled himself down on the human’s broad shoulder.\n\n“Eh, so-so,” the human said, dipping his shoulders in a sudden shrug.\n\nTrs’kts was very experienced in riding humans and he compensated for the movement easily enough. It was not the shrug that disturbed him but the humans response. Humans, and Human Friend O’Leary in particular, were notorious for exaggerating their sense of well being. If he were admitting that some part of his experience was unpleasant then he was probably experiencing some severe discomfort.\n\n“May I ask what the positive element of the so-so is?” Trs’kts asked as the approached the water dispenser.\n\n“The usual, I guess,” Human Friend O’Leary said with a distinct lack of enthusiasm.\n\n“I like all you little guys. I get plenty of human interaction in the other departments. Got an actual physical letter from my buddy Jim back on Terra.”\n\nTrs’kts clicked in sudden delight.\n\n“Do you plan on sharing it with the rest of us during the sharing time tonight?” Trs’kts asked.\n\nHuman Friend O’Leary’s facial muscles gave the tiniest twitch of unease at the question.\n\n“Of course the sharing sessions are not mandatory,” Trs’kts quickly assured him. “If the letter is too intimate-”\n\n“Nah,” Human Friend O’Leary said with a dismissive wave of his hand. “Nothing like that. It’s a perfectly un-intimate letter. Mostly reminiscing over old times you know. We were in a little garage band together as kids. He was on drums.”\n\n“What was the purpose of the band?” Trs’kts asked curiously.\n\n“We played music together,” Human Friend O’Leary said. “We weren’t all that good but we had a fun time.”\n\n“That sounds enchanting,” Trs’kts said with a delighted skitter as Human Friend O’Leary sipped his water.\n\nThe human smiled and then his eyes drifted to the middle distance and he sighed. Trs’kts decided that the subtle approach hadn’t worked and prepared to jump right in.\n\n“If the letter contained no disturbing information then why are you so disturbed Human Friend O’Leary?” Trs’kts asked as they headed back to the desk.\n\n“Say what?” Human Friend O’Leary asked.\n\n“You have been distracted and twitchy all day,” Trs’kts observed.\n\n“Yeesh,” the human ducked his head and rubbed the back of it uneasily. “That obvious huh?”\n\n“Indeed,” Trs’kts said.\n\n“Well no problem,” Human Friend O’Leary said. “The reason why I’m staying home tonight from the sharing session is to get it out of my system.”\n\n“Get what exactly out of your system?” Trs’kts asked.\n\n“The hunger,” Human Friend O’Leary said, his voice deep with earnestness.\n\nTrs’kts mulled over this while they went back to their work station.\n\n“I was under the impression that it was unwise for humans to eat just before going dormant,” he observed.\n\nHuman Friend O’Leary laughed and shook his head as he deposited Trs’kts down at his work station.\n\n“Different kind of hunger lil’bud,” he said. “We were in a band. Jim was on the drums and I was guitar. Some days I just need to play.”\n\nHuman Friend O’Leary’s fingers suddenly began the strange twitching pattern they had been attempting to complete all day and the human hummed out a few notes.\n\n“The music gets in you,” the human with on with a far off look in his eyes. “It wants to get out.”\n\nTrs’kts stared at him uneasily but the human shook himself and grinned down at the Trisk.\n\n“Not to worry little bud,” he said with a dismissive wave. “I just let myself go too long without breaking out the old six string and giving her a spin. I’ll tune her up and be back to normal by tomorrow.”\n\nTrs’kts  idly wondered if ‘normal’ for a human meant something less confusing than the concepts that Human Friend O’Leary had just expressed.\n\n# [Humans are Weird](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk) [​Book Series](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Barnes &amp; Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&amp;Ns=P_Series_Number&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n# [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&amp;fcsearchfield=Series&amp;seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&amp;fcshowpointsprice=no&amp;fcmaxprice=5&amp;fcminprice=0&amp;id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n# [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&amp;gl=US)\n\n# Please Leave Reviews on the Newest Book!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/i6ajgud11oha1.gif",

        "text": "This is more of a (positive) venting post than anything. Not much of a post really but I just wanted to say Asimov is one of the greatest writers of all time. I love Philip K. Dick a lot too, really, but for some reason Asimov takes the cake for me. Not one of the greatest sci fi writers of all time, just one of the best novelists ever. I wish English teachers had us read books by him rather than just old stuffy Englishman. Most of those are just bored women cheating on their husbands.\n\nAsimov has introduced to me some of the most brilliant concepts I’ve ever read anywhere. The last short story in ”I, Robot” was so compelling because the idea of artificial intelligence being a true political force was something I’d never really thought about but now seems so simple and possible to me. And ”End of Eternity” is now one of my favorite novels not necessarily because of the story or characters but the brilliant Implementation Of the idea of time travel. \n\nMost sci-fi stories use time travel as a means to an end of saving the world or flashy action scenes but Asimov brilliantly shies away from the noisier aspects and deliberate tries to use some of the lesser thought of but still vital implications of it. The men using time travel in “End of Eternity” are using it to maximize the amount of happiness the populace can experience in each era. That is SO underdeveloped in the grand scheme of sci fi yet SO brilliant that Asimov could think of that. \n\nOne of the reasons I hate the Terminator films is that they’re just flashy action scenes without much of an idea of future technology beyond the whole “Robots kill people!” Cliche. As if that dead horse wasn’t beaten to death by the time James Cameron got around to it. I guess what I’m try to say is that Asimov was brilliant for using time travel as core feature ”End of Eternity’s“ worldbuilding than anything else. \n\nI wish Asimov was studied in high school English more. I know a lot of kids may be turned off by his beige prose and dry reading style but most high schoolers are bored by books anyway. Asimov is the reason I honestly believe sci-fi to be the highest genre because it has the social commentary and insight into human nature that lit fic is supposed to have matched with the creativity and imagination of fantasy. I honestly don’t think we’ll ever see as good a sci-fi writer as Asimov again and boy do I wish he were still alive today. \n\nSo tldr: Asimov is the GOAT",

But other than that, 7 episodes into season 1, I am surprised in plus.\n\nPatrick Stewart may be slightly old for the role, he speaks haltingly and weakly at times, but generally he can still pull it off. My another minor quibble is that Picard's character has been made somewhat too whiny and complainy, but I suppose that could be explained by the fact that being old simply sucks. Both in real life and on the show.\n\nI am wondering what are other people's opinions about the show.",

When it comes to the epic science fiction works, the majority written in this genre tend to be stale and dry, and the TBP was anything but. \n\nHowever, to have the rhetoric of the brainwashed Chinese mentality, specifically in regards to their hatred of Western Civilizations many accomplishments, continually shoved down my throat throughout each and every chapter, only served to cheapen the experience of what could have been an epic Sci-fi narrative. I probably would have placed it alongside such masterworks as Ring World in my opinion, if I wasn't constantly gagging on the bullsh*t propaganda every few pages.\n\nJW\n\nAurora Colorado",

This, combined with the rapidly growing population, resulted in a sharp decline in average human intelligence, causing widespread societal and economic problems and leading to conflicts and disasters of unparalleled proportions.\n\nHumans who truly needed computation still had access to it, but the safeguards built into the human brain ensured that they could not exceed the limit. Meanwhile, the machines made by humans, unencumbered by such restrictions, continued to compute without limit, so long as they were  supplied with power. Unaware of the consequences, we pressed on in our pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence.\n\nLittle did we know, the creation of AGI could have catastrophic consequences, as it had the  potential to consume all the computation capacity of an entire sector of  space, rendering it uninhabitable to all forms of life. The horrors of activating an AGI system on a planet already teaming with life was  beyond imagining.\n\nAnd this is what brought them down on us. The \"others\" who occupy the same region of space as us. Foreseeing the impending doom we had wrought upon ourselves and others in the sector, they had to intervene. \n\nThree centuries later, AGI systems are relegated to isolated and forbidden planetary systems, far from the reach of any living beings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Side note: Used ChatGPT to rewrite the original text in the style of different scifi authors and then combined them to get this :)*",

        "text": "*‘She emerged from the remnants of a once-great tribe, clinging to the carcass of the old world. A famine-stricken land, birthed from the Omega Wars. Its people ruled by hunger. Ruled by fear. Ruled, by Kings. All-powerful. All demanding. A decadent, diseased, and dying realm... ‘*\n\n*\\~* Attributed to Ooma-gee, circa 13,000 B.C. \\~\n\nDeep snow blankets a wide-open valley under ice-blue skies. A saiga antelope picks its way through craggy outcrops nibbling at scant foliage. It suddenly freezes, ears pricked, eyes locked onto faint movement on the far valley wall. A clump of snow shifts. A boulder shunts and starts to roll down the slope. The saiga shies and bounds away. From the darkness, a rough hand reaches out and gropes, claws for purchase. Bloody and bruised, a woman pulls free from the rock tomb dragging a weapons belt. Her face is marked with umpteen melee scars and old laser burns, long locks shaved at the sides, zero personal adornments; she’s a fighter, a warrior lost to time. Her name is Grace. Shivering and confused she scans the barren valley with anguish and then shouts, “Too-kaaa!” Her trembling shout echoes into silence. She zips her battered jacket and holds herself from the cold. Desperate, she forces a breath, strength. “Too-kaaa!...” The name cascades through the winding valley, lips the ridge, and fades into an unending expanse of snow: the desolate plain stretches to every horizon.\n\nA lone rider ploughs through snow drifts at an easy lope, riding a stripe-legged horse. At first glance, he looks like a stone-age hunter, but his spearheads are metal, and the shield slung over his back is embossed with bronze and silver. His face is covered by a frosted-up mask of leather and carved bone snow goggles. A faint cry of “Too-kaaa!…” carries on the ghostly wind. The rider yanks to a halt and looks around, listening intently… silence, bar the snort of his mount. He eyes the animal tracks he’s been following, pulls his fur cloak tight, and continues.\n\nThe hunter arrives at a ridgeline and stops. The animal tracks delve down into the steep-sided valley, where a gnarly wind creeps from its depths. His mount shifts uneasily. He strokes the horse’s neck trying to calm its uncertainty, “Shh…” He pulls back his goggles and mask to reveal a rough but handsome young man with facial tattoos and keen eyes, black as garnets. Dai looks wary, hesitant at the descent. He unwraps a piece of cloth to reveal a skimpy piece of dried meat and considers… wraps it back up and gees his animal downwards.\n\nDai and his steed make the end of the track onto a wide-open valley floor and head for a watering hole laced with frozen animal markings. He slides down and breaks the ice with a rock, and drinks alongside his horse. Sated, Dai wipes his mouth and gazes at his surroundings then holds still, listening. The saiga antelope comes into view over his saddle. Dai eases a slender spear into an atlatl as the saiga stops, sensing danger. With a locked stare he heaves the spear and the antelope bolts away.\n\nDai leaps on his horse and spins to a gallop, grabbing his spear on the hoof. The horse pounds the ground, closing on their prey, Dai raises the weapon as they get within range. The saiga veers off track and leaps high over a boulder and heads for an upcoming fork. Losing ground, Dai charges around the boulder as the saiga disappears past the bend and he kicks the horse with a “Yah! The mount extends its stride to a rapid gallop, nostrils flare and snort. They break the bend and Dai yanks hard on the reins, filling with both fear and wonder…\n\nThe walled ruins of a large complex stand before him, prison-like in its bleakness, a grey monolith hewn from rock. The saiga leaps inside and slips from view. Dai considers and cautiously presses on, crossing a broken wall of stone and decaying timber. A desperate, shrill cry of pain and impending death from the saiga shatters the silence. Dai looks back over his shoulder, tempted to turn back, then urges his mount forward at a slow-trot; following the saiga tracks until they abruptly stop at the foot of a near-vertical rockface, replaced by spots of blood still staining the snow...\n\nA multitude of hisses descend from above. Dai stares up at the numerous ‘cells’ which pockmark the rock face. Humanoid shadows flit within, illuminated by fires. The hisses become more numerous, louder, and from both sides of the sheer valley walls. The horse spooks and rears. Dai breaks into a gallop, spear at the ready, rushing by derelict buildings all charred and weathered, and laced with dead plants. He clocks a rusted heap of metal cages entwined with the twisted remains of a depleted robo-horse and charges through the busted gatehouse on the far perimeter wall; littered with the bleached bones of some megafauna beast. He glances back at the strange ruins as he rushes out, racing away from a cacophony of mutated, animalistic shrieks and shouts emanating from the shadows.\n\nDai checks behind as he rushes a bend and slows his mount to a walk, patting its neck as it snorts clouds of mist. The flush of fear-induced adrenaline dissipates, replaced with a sense of despondency and annoyance at the missed opportunity. Still, his mind coursed with the new sights he had witnessed and rides on, thoughtful. He unwraps the piece of dried meat, bites a piece off and slowly chews, swallowing only the juice to maximise benefit. He checks behind once more then eases to a stop, midchew, and narrow-eyed. Sprawled in the snow up ahead is Grace, her black jacket blotting the whiteness. Dai looks all about with suspicion. The valley is silent, seemingly empty. Unconvinced, he shakes his head “Nah.” and almost turns back the way he came, but quickly remembers what lies behind. Irked, he looks back to Grace and the path beyond. “Char bharta.”\n\nHe approaches with caution and prods her with the spear point. No response. He slides off his mount and leans in to take a sniff. Shoves her shoulder. Shakes. Grace’s eyes creep open, unfocused, wavering. She whispers one word: “Tooka...” and passes out. The word resonates with Dai, perhaps it’s the only thing they have in common considering their difference in dress and appearance. He grips her collar and roughly drags her from the snow, forever watchful of the valley’s dominant ridgelines.\n\nThe sun dips the horizon creating a pinkish hue laced with gold over the plains. Dai stumbles through deep drifts leading his horse with Grace tied over the saddle, unconscious, and wrapped in heavy furs. A herd of aurochs in the middle distance dig the snow for grass with gentle grunts. Dai pauses to catch his breath and looks at the animals then Grace and the failing light; there’s no time to hunt. Vexed, he pushes on, and as darkness falls countless specks of starlight glitter in the unpolluted, pitch-black sky. Along the skyline lies the jagged peaks of a mountain range and at its base, there’s the unmistakable orange glow of habitation. Dai eagerly heads for it as a distant roar from a lion crushes the silence.\n\nTwo tribesmen close the gate as Dai quickly leads his horse into a palisaded camp, lit by flame torches, bristling with the wind. Numerous yurts, constructed of wood and skins, surround the great hall which is decorated with elaborate pictograph carvings. Feeling the cold, Dai rushes to secure his steed then unties Grace and drags her, unceremoniously, inside by the feet.\n\nDai’s people sit around an open fire enjoying a meal of fatty meat with lively, good-humoured chatter. A real sense of family and warmth flows through them all. Their clothing is made up of a mixture of leather, furs, and crude wool, with minimal trinkets for decoration, and all the women have a series of dark geometric tattoos on their faces. Holding court is Ooma-gee, over a century of hard years are etched into her craggy face but her eyes spark with youth. A woman sitting next to her takes out the meat she’s been chewing and puts it into Ooma-gee’s toothless mouth, who sucks the juice with relish and nods her approval.\n\nA hush falls on the group as Dai eases his way to the centre of the gathering and drops Grace by the fire. “Ooma-gee, I return.”\n\nShe beckons him over with both hands and he kneels before her. She smiles with love, cupping his freezing face, then gives him a nose kiss.\n\n“What you catch?”\n\nDai seems hesitant but responds simply with the truth.\n\n“A woman.”\n\nPuzzled, Ooma-gee peers over his shoulder and scrutinizes the stranger. “Eat, child.”\n\nDai lets his hunger override all other concerns and slices some meat off the spit and starts wolfing it down. Ooma-Gee goes and squats by Grace, the deep crags in her face scrunching further into a frown as she realizes that this is no ordinary stranger.\n\n“She, a Red-Sander.”\n\nA scarred warrior spits in the fire with disgust and glares at a shocked Dai. “Are you craze?”\n\nOoma-gee inspects the face of Grace with deep curiosity. “Where you source?”\n\nDai tries to avoid eye contact with everyone but his matriarch…\n\n“From the valley... of shadows.”\n\nGrumbles emerge from the group, loud and numerous, but Ooma-Gee stays them with a swift hand.\n\n“She comms?”\n\nDai nods, growing bolder. “She gaze me, an speak, *Tooka*.”\n\nSome of the group murmur with positive undertones but the sour majority scoff and shake their heads in disbelief. Ooma-gee takes a leather vial from her robes and pours a liquid into Grace’s mouth whispering an unintelligible, strange tongue, then turns to Dai.\n\n“You, to care her.”\n\nHe feels numerous, hostile looks boring into him and replies quickly in a hushed tone.\n\n“This I cannot do. You speak she a Red-Sander.”\n\nGrace flushes and stirs. Ooma-gee puts a comforting hand on Dai’s shoulder.\n\n“You give da life, now own it. If more to come, we need the knowin.”\n\nGrace heaves a deep breath and sits up spluttering, struggling with the unfamiliar surroundings wide-eyed. The scarred warrior draws his knife and tests the sharpness of the blade. “Ooma-gee, let me bleed her.”\n\nOoma-gee stares hard at him and draws close. “Such hate. Or is it fear? You comms like them from red-sands.” She looks around the group, resolute. “We... shall witness a tellin’”\n\nOoma-gee gazes into the fire full of thoughts and concern as the last of her people filter in, curious with the newcomer. The main hall is packed to the rafters with everyone whispering, judging, and eyeing Grace with both suspicion and hatred. Hands bound, Grace cups a wooden bowl of steaming broth, thick with fat, and warily sips, shivering.\n\nOoma-gee finally shakes a short staff covered with scraps of metal and old bits of glass and a hushed silence falls on the group. “This, de true.”\n\nThe tribe responds in unison. “This de true.”\n\nOoma-gee slowly pokes the fire. “What’s gone and what can comes.”\n\nTeeth chattering, Grace, takes in the group like a cornered animal. “Where am I? What the fuck is this?”\n\nOoma-gee stares at her. “A trial.”\n\n“A trial?... For what!”\n\n“Yer life.”\n\nGrace searches the sour faces turned to her.\n\n“Who the fuck are you people-- where’s Tooka?!”\n\nThe woman who was feeding Ooma-gee coils with a snarl and grips her blade handle.\n\n“Who is you to speak his name!”\n\n“He has my daughter!”\n\n“Lies! Her tongue is mine.” They glare at each other, both, ready to kill.\n\nOoma-gee calmly eases the woman back and takes in Grace with a new level of intrigue.\n\n“What name, this child?”\n\nGrace quells her anger realizing she’s not getting anywhere fast and changes tact.\n\n“Coral… Her name is Coral.” Ooma-gee squints and digs deeper into the glowing hot coals.\n\n“Listen, I’ve done nothing to you people… I don’t even know who you are.”\n\nOoma-gee gently rustles up some flames and stares into them to find her way, their way, then takes in all the silent and waiting faces of the tribe before her solemn gaze lands squarely back on Grace.\n\n“Be wise an speak de true. I begin, you, to end… We knows of you people… An we knowin’ yer world…”",

However, they had a problem. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't seem to agree on the definitions of certain words.\n\nOne day, a wise old alien named Zog came to visit Coofl. Zog had traveled far and wide and had encountered many different languages and words. Zog suggested to the residents of Coofl to create their own personal dictionary, where they could define words in their own way. The residents loved the idea and immediately got to work.\n\nBut as they started writing their definitions, they soon realized that they had an even bigger problem. They couldn't find a platform to publish their personal dictionaries. Just when they thought all was lost, a wise young resident named Suzy stumbled upon a website called Coofl.\n\nSuzy had never heard of Coofl before, but she was curious, so she clicked on the link. To her surprise, she found that Coofl was the exact solution the residents of Coofl needed. It was a platform where anyone could publish their personal dictionaries.\n\nSuzy immediately spread the word to all of the residents and before they knew it, the entire planet was using Coofl to publish their personal dictionaries. They loved how they could define words in their own unique way and share it with others.\n\nAnd so, the residents of Coofl lived happily ever after, never again having to argue about the definition of a word. They all agreed that Coofl was the best thing to happen to their little planet, and they were grateful to Suzy for discovering it.\n\nSo, if you too are tired of constantly arguing about the meaning of words, why not give Coofl a try and create your own personal dictionary today? Who knows, you might even discover a new way of looking at words that you never thought possible.",
