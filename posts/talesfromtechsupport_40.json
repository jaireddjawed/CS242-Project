        "text": "December was a very slow month. Either people were busy planning Christmas parties, were getting super drunk at Christmas parties, or recovering from getting super drunk at Christmas parties... or, for a change of pace, it was Christmas and no one was working.\n\nAll of this conspired to give us few cases to work with, and those were pretty standard.\n\n&gt;Me: ...I see that your credit card expired, and the auto-renewal failed. Let's get the card details fixed, and the license reactivated...\n\n&gt;Me: ...no, it won't sync like that... you have to rename it to remove the special char--- yes, that character. It's reserved for--- it's a programming thing.\n\nJanuary kicked everything back into normal mode. With \"normal\" comes the weird stuff.\n\nAlso with January came a change in the process: Due to excessive cherry-picking by techs (and team leads picking tickets out of the general queue to be routed to their teams), $BSS' overlords decreed that a new automated process be put in place, where a tech sets themselves \"Available\" in the queue and tickets get assigned to them.\n\n...or, rather, they are given a \"choice\" of accepting an anonymous ticket or rejecting it. We do **not** reject them, per our team leads.\n\n    TICKET: My passwords stopped working on my apps two days ago happened twice since November I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS\n\n(...and this kind of title is why people cherry-pick...)\n\nI looked into the admin's history. Two tickets in two months, and mine makes three. Also, the tickets were peppered with... colorful... abbreviations, like they didn't want to actually say \"motherpuppy,\" but definitely meant it (\"I can't get the GD thing to work!\" was a common phrase). It was like reading text-speak, and she had a \"valley-girl\" name, so I immediately thought of her as Valley Admin ($VA).\n\n&gt;Me: Good afternoon, this is *molotok* from $BSS, I'm calling about...\n\n&gt;$VA: ohthankyouthankyou**THANKYOU** forcallngmebacksoquick,like,OMGit'sbeenanightmare,like,workingwith---\n\n&gt;Me (*waiting for the flood of speech to subside*): May I set up a remote session to view this---\n\n&gt;$VA:Sure,I'malreadyatthepage,andlike,waitingforthecode!\n\n&gt;Me: Okay...\n\nI got the session set up, and saw what was happening:\n\nWhen $VA opened $email_client, it prompted her for her password, which isn't unusual, per se. It then threw up a certificate error, which... yes, was odd.\n\nThe certificate was **not** from $BSS, where her email was comng from. **That** was odd.\n\n(At this point, I'll slow down $VA's speech so you can understand it. Keep in mind that she spoke at about 1000 words/second the whole time, like the squirrel from *Hoodwinked*.)\n\n&gt;$VA: And, like,when I open Word...\n\nShe did so, and there was a license error. I knew that was wrong, because she was paid up.\n\n&gt;$VA: I can only use it it, like, when I sign in using the super-long @domain.$BSS_domain.com, and it's, like, **super** annoying.\n\n&gt;Me: Let's go back to the certificate error.\n\nShe did so. It was a valid certificate, for autodiscover.randomdomain.com... and randomdomain had nothing to do with the client.\n\nImmediately, I knew it was a bad DNS record somewhere. We are still having $config_panel issues, so I checked. Sure enough...\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, go to yourdomain.com/config_panel. Your autodiscover is getting routed there, so let's get that resolved, and everything else **should** fall into place.\n\n&gt;$VA: how do I sign in her? Like, my DNS should be through $Cereal, and I don't, like, see anything about them here.\n\nAnd so, we went to $Cereal and signed in.\n\nIt took us to her domain manager, where she promptly clicked on the web-page builder and put us in a click-hole for five minutes.\n\n&gt;$VA: ...and it's not in here... and it's, like, not in here... and it's like, not here...\n\nI let her get clicked out. It's only a few minutes, and I don't have any super-pressing cases... plus, her general enthusiasm for the process is kind of contagious.\n\nShe knows that she doesn't know what the issue is, is okay with looking in odd places for the issue, and damnit, I liked *Valley Girl* because Nicholas Cage is always entertaining to watch. I'm having fun with this.\n\n&gt;Me: It wouldn't be in the web-page building, so let's go back to the domain bit...\n\nI spotted it immediately.\n\n&gt;Me: Right there. A link to $config_panel.\n\nWe clicked in, and went to the Email section.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, let me check up on something really quick to see... huh.\n\nIn a stunning twist, the correct \"Autodiscover\" setting was already selected.\n\n&gt;Me: Well.\n\n&gt;$VA: So, like, what's next?\n\n&gt;Me: It's not $config_panel... it was working until two days ago, and now it's not... autodiscover is looking for $BSS and finding randomdomain... let's see something in the DNS tracing...\n\nI bring up a tool on my PC, check the DNS that's visible, and...\n\nTwist 2: **There is no autodiscover record**.\n\nWhat. The. Heck?!?\n\n...and I'm thinking out loud, and realize it.\n\n&gt;Me: I apologize, I'm talking my way through this...\n\n&gt;$VA: It's, like, okay, I have a lot of tech friends that, like, do the same thing.\n\n&gt;Me: Let's back this up, and check the DNS editor...\n\nWe found the relevant section, and I talked her through the process of adding the proper CNAME record. I checked it proofread it, and made sure it was the proper record.\n\nHowever...\n\n    ERROR: Cannot have a CNAME record with the same name as an A record.\n\n...um... what!?!\n\nSure enough... halfway down the page... there's a record with the name we need, set as an A record rather than a CNAME record.\n\nWhy does this matter? I'm not the best at explaining DNS, so as I understand it, an A record points to an IP, while a CNAME points to a resource at that IP.\n\n...so basically, $email_client found the right building, but only found the apartment when it wasn't looking for it. Sort of.\n\nI directed her to edit the record to be a CNAME record. Then I let her know that it could be a few minutes until we could...\n\n&gt;$VA: I'm going to try it, like, **now**.\n\n&gt;Me: It may not work right away.\n\nAfter 3 minutes, and three tries...\n\n&gt;$VA: OMG it works! Thankyouthankyouthankyou!!!\n\n(Yes, she actually said \"OMG\" out loud!)\n\nSo we went back to the other apps she was trying to sign into...\n\n&gt;$VA: They're working now! It's amazing! Like, I can't believe no one else found that! You're amazing!\n\n...and now, I have the distinction of having the only feedback that starts with \"OMG!\"\n\nI'm now left with a mystery: how was it working at all when it wasn't set up properly in the first place?\n\nTL;DR: DNS only works when nothing is looking for it; it changes as it is observed.",

        "text": "*Hi all, LTL;FTP etc.*\n\n*I'm here with a (hopefully) quick story from an academic chemistry department. The short character list is as follows:*\n\n**$PD:** Our resident post-doctoral researcher\n\n**$Acad:** One of the scary academic researchers\n\n**$CS:** Crusty Santa - our basically retired technician\n\n**$Me:** Yours truly, a final year PhD student\n\n***\n\nTo give a little bit of context to this story, it's important to note a couple of pieces of information:\n\n1. Chemistry departments will nearly always contain Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometers. These acquire very useful data on which a large percentage of the researchers in the department will rely.\n2. These vital machines break all the goddamn time.\n3. Academics are universally allergic to computers.\n\nI, based on an ability to look at a UNIX machine without gibbering in panic, am recognised as the resident IT wizard in our part of the department. While I don't hold any official role as such, the unfortunate uselessness of our department's official IT support means that I'm often approached with problems when they arise. Over the last few years, I've also picked up some bits and pieces of technical support knowledge to do with the various machines in the department. Due to a perhaps masochistic willingness to say yes when asked to help with something - combined with my colleagues' phobias of anything computer based - I'm often the first person approached when something breaks.\n\nI do, however, have one rule. Never the NMR machines. They're such horrible, sadistic monsters that even the printers plugged into them look upon them with a mixture of fear and admiration. They break at a moment's notice, simply because they feel like it. They also cost hundreds of thousands of pounds.\n\nSo, when $PD approached my fumehood and said something about not being able to launch the program we use to look at the NMR data, I felt a distinct urge to start a lab fire as an excuse to get out of the building.\n\nA quick glance at her computer showed a very definite error:\n\n\"Waiting for FLEXlm license\n\nFLEXlm FEATURE TOPSPIN3 Server node is down or not responding\"\n\nAh. A server problem. After a quick troubleshooting session (replicating the issue on a number of other machines, testing the internet connection, seeing if the university webpage loaded successfully etc), I decided that this was somewhat above my pay grade and reluctantly submitted a ticket to the IT team. However, I did think that I should go down to the NMR room and notify $CS about the issue. This man appears as if Santa had both an alcohol and a nicotine addiction, and is somewhat fearsome if roused (and the NMR machines are his chief responsibility). If the NMR server was down, it's likely no data was being collected. Also, any slight error would definitely cause the machine to crash.\n\nOutside the room, I heard the raised voices of $Acad and $CS having a somewhat... lively debate about the quality of the machines in question. It appeared that $Acad had run into the same problem as us, and had come straight down to $CS to rant about it. My appearance was greeted by a dismissive glance from $Acad and a grunt from $CS - but at least appeared to calm $Acad down. As he continued to complain in less brusque tones to $CS, I noticed a computer next to one of the machines that was normally turned on was now turned off. A quick check of my email to the IT team confirmed that the machine name was the name of the license server. I surreptitiously turned the machine on, and waited for $Acad to leave before telling $CS.  \n",

        "text": "I work for a company that provides data feeds from our clients, through to marketplaces and digital marketing channels like eBay and Google Shopping. As we manage hundreds of clients who have tens of thousands of products each, we require all images to be sent to us as a URL, which then gets loaded on the marketplace end.\n\nOne of our new clients (the national IT manager) realised on the last day of the deadline (at 6pm on a Friday) that they actually didn't have any URLS, just the actual .JPG files, leading to this conversation:\n\nClient: we actually don't have any image URLs, can I just email you all of the images and you put them in? (Note: there were about 1500 products with 2-3 images per product, at around 2mb each image)\n\nMe: unfortunately we can't process the actual images, we need you to host them on your server and send us the URL\n\nClient: yeah but just this one time can we load them via email?\n\nMe: oh no maybe I wasn't clear - this isn't a situation of \"won't\" - it's physically impossible to email that many images then load them. Both us and eBay need the URLs\n\nClient: okay but what about just this one time? Can you do it for me please?\n\nMe: (starting to feel very confused) I'm sorry, I literally can't. There is no physical way for me to do that, we can ONLY take URLs. If we could take images I would do it for you\n\nClient: okay how much is it gonna cost me if I just email it to you now to load in?\n\nMe: nothing, as I said there is no physical way I can do this even if I wanted to. You NEED to provide me the hosted URL\n\nClient: okay what if you just pretended there was a URL and told your boss it had one but uploaded it anyway?\n\n(This continued for another minute or two until I eventually made him understand it had to run via a hosted URL. He agreed to send me an excel of all the URLs and I breathed a sigh of relief thinking this was over. Instead, I received a file with all the images linking directly to the image location on his PC hard drive. So I called him back again)\n\nMe: hey, these images still aren't hosted, this is just a destination on your hard drive. \n\nClient: yeah it's hosted on my computer\n\nMe: that won't work, this isn't a web address it's just a copy of your internal hard drive destination\n\nClient: what's wrong with that?\n\nMe: we have no way to access your hard drive, it needs to be on a server\n\nClient: what if I don't turn my computer off overnight?\n\nMe: (starting to get frustrated) no. It has to be hosted on a server with a destination URL. Take the images, load them onto your company server, send me the folder destination and I'll manually copy each link for you\n\nClient: we don't have a server \n\nMe: what's your website hosted on then? (Note they sell goods exclusively online)\n\nClient: the internet\n\nMe: ... \n\nMe: okay, just to get the project off the ground, send me three photos and I'll host them on my own personal website, send you the URLs, you can copy the most appropriate one into the feed for each item then we can sort out hosting next week (it is now 8pm on a Friday). Just update the excel sheet with the URLs in the \"image\" column and we will be good to go. \n\nClient: okay, thanks so much!\n\nI went ahead and hosted the images, sent the three URLs it on to him, waited half an hour then finally received an email\n\nFrom: Client\n\nSubject: Completed feed\n\nText: Okay this should be everything - it's getting late so I'm heading out, I wish you'd just asked for this to begin with so we didn't have to stay late. Thanks though, talk to you next week!\n\nAttachments: Three tiny versions of the .jpgs of the images I already hosted. \n\nThis man is the *national* IT manager of one of the largest companies in their industry. \n",

        "text": "I work in a hospital, and we often come across many strange things during our work. And usually I take these 'incidents' in stride. But this one is bugging me for some reason.\n\nOne of our departments recently purchased a bunch of new ECG machines. These 'new' machines had the great benefit of having a wifi dongle attached to them so they can be connected to our corporate Wifi network. (They could've purchased these dongles for the 'old' machines, as they are the same, but alas) The 'old' machines were connected via ethernet cables, and that was a hassle because you know: cables.\n\nSo the dept spent a fairly large sum of money on these and they were happy. When they arrived after 6 months (Don't ask: Hospital politics) I had to hold the hands of the engineers installing them because they haven't worked with a WPA2 Enterprise network before (WTF?) and the dongles were just new enough to support it.\n\nEverything was running a-ok for a few weeks when suddenly the dept. IT contact called us in a near panic. The shiny new machines stopped working this morning. We checked everything, it had an IP, it wasn't blocked, it pinged, still had the same hostname and on the right VLAN and the receiving server could see these machines. And rebooting the machines didn't work. I told the IT contact to contact the manufacturer (we don't normally contact the manufacturers, that's the job of the Dept. IT Contact). She did and they logged in remotely to do the same checks we did. After that they told her everything was working a-ok on their end and the problem was on our end.\n\nAt that point the IT contact was in a panic, she called her manager, my manager, my managers manager and the CEO about this Huge Fucking Problem that was Impacting Patient Care. And Patient Care is big in a hospital, you don't use that in a sentence unless the problem is *directly impacting patient care*. Being a ECG machine with a local printer it most definitely wasn't directly impacting patient care, as it could just print the results of the ECG on paper in stead of directly pushing it to the server.\n\nMy manager told her that and she went into meltdown-mode. Crying and bitching about the 'IT people that don't understand how much impact this has on the dept.' Meanwhile I had a few co-workers working on the problem, and she was well aware of that, but we didn't find *any* problem with the machines. They should have been working 100% that morning. My manager practically forced the IT contact to make another call, and again she did.\n\nShe got through to one of the engineers that installed the machines a few weeks ago and she relayed the problem to him with me adding some technical details to the story. The click my story made in his head was almost audible, and even I could sense something popped into his head. But before I could ask he told me he would call right back.\n\n5 minutes later the ECG machines started pumping data again.\n\n*rrrring*\n\nManufacturer: Me here, I had an idea, can you confirm it works?\n\nIT Contact: Yes, it just started working!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!\n\nManuf: yeah, it was an easy fix\n\nMe: What happened?\n\nManuf: We.. Well, yeah.\n\nMe: ??\n\nManuf: We were testing some settings on the ECG machines yesterday and forgot to turn $Function back on\n\nMe: ???\n\nMe: You mean you were testing on *LIVE* and *customer owned* equipment?\n\nManuf: ^^^yes\n\nMe: ...\n\n*click*\n\nI wrote an complete AAR (After Action Report) in the support ticket we logged for this incident, and I made sure it was 100000% clear that this was a issue that originated from testing by the manufacturer. I also forwarded that ticket to our CSO, who's having a field day with that one.\n\nEven now I feel anger and amazement. How the fuck could someone making medical equipment run fucking live tests, no matter how insignificant, on medical equipment that they are well aware of /is in production. And the IT Contact all thought it was perfectly normal.. because they fixed it.\n\nBut not after some serious pressuring from our side...\n\nLet's just say I'm glad these people don't make our endoscopy equipment..\n",

On mobile, so if I've made any formatting errors let me know!\n\n I've been in technical support for just over 6 months, and this story happened a few months ago. I have a few stories already but this is a personal favourite. \n\nThis was a phone conversation between $me, and $customer. $customer is the head of his company and a bit infamous in ours. A lovely guy, but can be a bit demanding and is very mental. \n\nBackstory, sometimes we have to log into $thirdparty software with their account, and they have recently changed the way we do this. It's a nightmare and we need new usernames and passwords for all of our users accounts. Some people, like $customer, prefer to do this over the phone. The following conversation happened during one of these phone calls. Both of us are native English speakers in the same country, but different regions. \n\n------\n\n$me: hey $customer, I'm just calling to get the new password for $thirdparty. You should have got the email with the username. \n\n$customer: hey no problem, I have it here. The password is word1234\n\n$me: okay cool I'll try that while I have you on the phone. To confirm its word1234 ?\n\n$customer: yes, with splat at the end. \n\nI tried word1234splat, didn't work\n\n$me: hey $customer, that didn't work sorry. Was it word1234splat ?\n\n$customer: yes, with like an exclamation mark at the end \n\nTried this, didn't work \n\n$me: sorry about this. Just to triple check, it's word 1234 splat exclamation mark\n\n$customer: no not with the exclamation mark, just with splat \n\nStill not working \n\n$me: I'm really sorry again, it must be my accent.

(watches every shitty decision I made which drove me to this point flash before my eyes) ... \n\n$me: An exclamation mark?\n\n$customer, cheery as anything: yeah that's the one! We call it the splat symbol!\n\nI enter word1234! and I'm in. I let him know I'll look into his issue and give him an update when I can. \n\n-------\n\nWho's \"we\" $customer, who's \"we\"???",

She’s probably late 60’s, our head of sales, would probably believe that a computer mouse is called a mouse because in the 80’s they originally used dead mice connected to a computer. For context, one time she told me her computer was broken and it wouldn’t turn on, she had been trying everything she could think of for 15 minutes… The monitor was turned off.\n\nItalics are my thoughts, or sometimes actions. \n\n**Wednesday, 2:00PM, just returned from Lunch** \n\n$E: “$J, I need help downloading a really large spreadsheet”\n\nMe: *uh… You download it. It’s not like carrying things in from the car and if it’s two heavy you need extra hands... just download it* “Ok, lets see what I can do to help.”\n\nI walk over. She’s got 30 sheets of paper scattered all over her desk, and a ruler and scotch tape and a pen... she printed out a large spreadsheet and was taping it together...\n\n$J: “$E, don’t you want to just work off the spreadsheet on the computer?”\n\n$E: “oh no, this kind of stuff has to be done by hand.” riiiiiight…\n\nShe’s working on a quote, and she wants to go line by line, and cross out the ones she’s done, so she knows which one to work on next. She’s then filling in the data into an empty printed spreadsheet, by hand, with a pencil, so she can type it up by hand later. There’s still a dent in the floor from where my jaw hit it. \n\nAnyway, I help her print something that wouldn’t print out right for her, and that was all she needed; no downloading of a large file, she meant printing a large file, and by large she meant physically large when printed. Not like a 2GB excel sheet…\n\n*2 hours later*\n\n$E: “$J, there was a bunch of data in this file they sent to me, but I must have deleted it.”\n\n$J: “do you still have the email?”\n\n$E: “yes”\n\n$J: “ok let’s just redownload the original file”\n\nI go to the email, download it. I see File_name (7).xlsx appear in the downloads folder… She’s downloaded it 6 other times already… I open the file\n\n$E: “see, all the data is gone. this area right here” pointing with her finger touching the monitor… “this used to be filled with lots of item sizes.”\n\n$JD: “did you type the sizes in, Or were they there when the customer sent it to you?”\n\n$E: “they sent it. It’s all this data here...” *hands me one of her 30 pages of excel printouts…*\n\n$J: I look at one cell, press control F, type in the data, find it in another tab…\n\n$E: “oh you got it back!”\n\n$J: “no it was in tab ‘5.4 Bags’ instead of ‘5.5 Poly’”\n\n$E: “oh, well the customer asked me to quote tab 5.5.”\n\n$J: “well the spreadsheet you printed was from 5.4”\n\n$E: “but it was in 5.5 when they sent it the first time”\n\n$J: *looking for a drill bit so I can put it through my temple...* “no, this is the exact file they sent you”\n\n$E: “then why was it different earlier?”\n\n$J: “You know what $E, thats a great question…” and I just walk away. \n\n**Monday, Morning, 10:00 AM**\n\n$E: “$J, I entered a lot of information into the spreadsheet on friday, and I was 80% of the way done, and I saved it to come back and finish it today, but now all the data is gone.”\n\n$J: *OK, what do you want to bet she saved it Friday, but now she’s opening one of the other 7 versions of the file she had downloaded last week…* “Ok $E, lets take a look.” \n\nWe walk over, I ask her on the way there: “Where did you save the file on Friday?”\n\n$E: “In excel.” \n\n$J: “No I mean which directory, which file? Was it on your computer or did you save it to one of the file servers?”\n\n$E: “No I didn’t click “save as” and put it in a folder, I just clicked save and saved it in excel. It’s not in a file…”\n\n$J: *Flashes a Smile.* “OK well let’s see what I can do…”\n\nI sit down, I go to her downloads folder, I see the most recent download is File_Name (15).xlsx \n\n**Wut…**\n\nI scroll through the downloads folder and find one that showed a modified date of Friday at 3:30. Click it, open it, all the info is there. \n\n$J: “Ok, $E, Here it is. Can I ask you exactly what you did when you go to work this morning and wanted to work on this file?”\n\n$E: “Well, I turned on my computer, I opened outlook, I clicked the email that had the attachment, and I opened the attachment again to work on it.”\n\n$J: “$E, we talked about this last week, when you save a file, it doesn’t save it to that email, that is the original copy of the file they sent you, and it’s just going to download another version of the original. When you save it, its going to save it in your downloads folder.”\n\n$E: “Well theres 15 versions of it in there, how am I supposed to know which is the right one?”\n\nI need bourbon. Lots and lots of bourbon. ",

        "text": "Last week I started Tech School (USAF stuff). I made a few friends in my class and one of them was having his family drive up and drop off some of his gear, including a slightly aged MSI laptop. \n\nLast night my friend (Fr) texts me saying \"My laptop won't work.\" \nAnd so the tale begins... (Mr - Me)\n\nFr: \"My laptop won't work.\"\nMr: \"What do you mean?\"\nFr: \"When I boot it up, it goes straight to BIOS.\"\nMr: \"Odd, can you stop by so I can take a look at it?\"\n\nFr comes over and I take a look at the laptop. Its in decent condition, other than a small piece of the chassis cracked off in one of the corners.\nI plug the laptop in and boot it up, it goes straight to BIOS. Fr tells me that Windows is installed on an SSD, which doesn't show up in BIOS. Fr gives me a Windows recovery USB, which he said didn't help when he tried it. I try the USB, and nothing happens. I reload the USB with Windows installer and try again, this time booting into the Windows setup. All of the recovery options don't work however. At this point its late at night, and we have curfew in 45min - an hour, so we agree to meet up and deal with it in the morning.\n\nEarlier this morning...\nFr drops by again with the laptop, this time he brings screwdrivers at my request. We spend an hour not able to boot into the USB, again. At this point I want to open up the laptop and look at the drives installed in it. Fr keeps telling me there's nothing wrong with the drives, he checked them himself before he came by last night. I open it anyways.\nAfter opening the laptop, I remove the drives (an m.2 SSD and a SATA HDD) and boot from the USB, which goes straight to Windows setup. I try booting with the HDD in next, also going straight to Windows setup. Next I put in the SSD, and the laptop boots straight to Windows, skipping the USB. \nFr: \"What\"\nMr: \"What\"\nThen I realized that the m.2 was installed upside down when I opened up the laptop... We sealed up the laptop and it booted to Windows again, no problem. Fr has no idea how the SSD could have been flipped upside down, he had added the SATA drive a few months before BMT, but he was able to boot after that. We have no idea how the SSD got flipped, but its fixed now...\n\nTLDR; Friend's laptop wouldn't boot. Turned out to be the m.2 SSD installed upside down. Friend has no idea how the drive got flipped.",

        "text": "(Warning: mildyly offtopic, but maybe /u/ditch_lily will enjoy it.)\n\nSo my wife took her sewing machine to teach a friend how to sew. As I learned later, her friend had a under-$20 machine she had bought from Aldi or something, which was total junk. She then *later* found that the friend had a late 80s name-brand (Singer) machine from her grandmother which needs to be oiled and cleaned, but probably will keep working through any apocalypses that may occur.  But that's not the fun part.\n\nMy wife's machine is not great (unknown brand), but is an older machine and works well for her when she wants to sew. She gets it maintained (which was in part after me talking about this person I've heard of online who fixes old sewing machines and how a little preventative maintenance and cleaning can really make a lot of difference).\n\nAnyway, she brings the machine back from her friend's after a fun day teaching her friend and friend's teen daughter some basic sewing (I spent the day watching cheesy movies and painting minis, if you really want to know. It was awesome). She did the right thing, and brought the machine inside when she got home and didn't run it for 10+ hours so there shouldn't have been any temperature problems.\n\nIt's broken. I'm working on something and see the end-cap of the big knob on the end pop off. I want to stay out of it because I can take over projects instead of teaching, but I got nervous when I saw what looked like an attempt to use mind powers to make a part hover in place while shoving the cap back on. \n\nWhen it reached the proper level of dire I asked permission to get involved after the proper amount of hovering around and fetching screwdrivers. My wife did most of the work, because I don't want to break her machine. More than it was...\n\nProblem: Needle won't move when machine is given gas via the peddle. Works when you turn the big knob (hereafter \"BFK\"). I figure there's got to be some sort of 'clutch' like mechanism that connects the motor to the 'drivetrain' for it.  We also couldn't remove the BFK cover-plate, which as I said was kind of forced on...\n\nMy wife takes the covers off and we look at it. I can fix computers sometimes, but this is a lot more... automotive... than what I usually handle. Not really my thing. Still, i have to at least try, right? \n\nProblem 1 is getting that cap off. I fiddle with it, and figure out that by blocking the 'driveshaft' momentarily I can get a grip and pop it off. Maybe this will help.\n\nNext step: Do basic tech stuff. Assess, figure out how it's supposed to work. Remember that part my wife tried to hover in place? it's a smallish silver ring. Got a couple projections on the outside, and a couple on the inside. The inside ones are flanged.\n\nI reverse that part, seat it in place, and put the cap back on. Everything works! It sounds a 'little funny' but the covers are off (which can change noise a lot) and since it's not my toy I'm not going full speed on the pedal. Also not going full speed because the covers are off, it's running 'empty' (is that bad? I have no idea. It is for some machinery.) and I have no idea what I'm doing.\n\nPut it back together, test it: Everything seems fine so far. Maybe move up getting maintenance done. Basic tech strategy works nearly every time!\n\n(Edit: i think I got the username reference right. Or not.)\n",

I want to be able to go on YouTube on my school laptop but I can’t’\nWe have a select range of IP’s allowed on certain websites, and for some reason $Sasha had the wrong IP so she couldn’t access certain websites.\nSo I check DHCP reservations on the server, and see there’s a couple free IP’s, ping the IP just to check and it comes back that it’s cool to use.\nSo I set it up and it’s all working fine.\nLater in the day $Sasha comes back.\n$Sasha - ‘$Me! The photocopier is doing some weird stuff. Keeps getting stuck and can’t connect to the server’\n(FYI our photocopier sucks, always breaks)\nSo I go over and indeed it keeps failing to connect to the server which is causing people not to be able to print etc \nIt had been happening all day but no one had said anything to me.\nI log into the print server to check if anything weird is going on there.\nTurns out the IP that I had given to $Sasha was the same IP for the printer so the printer was down like all day ): \nWas a quick fix but I felt like an absolute idiot.",

My responsibility is to assign the unit a number and the correct call configuration, based on where the user is in the country and what information they've supplied about the unit.\n\nI complete the job and let the user who requested the ticket know it has  been completed and that they can check the unit to see if it's operational. As a courtesy to users I will provide basic advice to get the device running, standard plug in this, turn it off and on type stuff.\n\nAfter guiding the user we come to the conclusion something is wrong. I check the unit has been successfully provisioned and let the user know that everything from my end is okay. I double check the model is in fact model a. The user says no it's actually model B.\n\nAlas, we have found the problem. I let the user know they submitted for a model a unit to be provisioned, which is incorrect and that they now need to submit a new ticket for their actual device to be configured. The user asks why the current ticket can't be updated and I advise that for the integrity of the data it needs to reflect what has actually been installed at the location.\n\nThe following exchange proceeds:\n\nMe 'you will need to submit a new ticket, I've now closed this ticket off'\n\nUser 'why? This unit is not working. How can you close a ticket when it is not working?'\n\nMe 'my job is to provision the unit as per your request. Unfortunately device set up is not part of my scope, and as you have input incorrect information, I need you to submit a new ticket so I can assist further'\n\nUser 'but you haven't fulfilled my request, the unit does not work'\n\nMe 'I have completed what you requested. You requested for a model A to be assigned a number in x region. That has now been completed. Please relog the ticket with the correct information'\n\nThe user continues to argue why this is bad service, but reluctantly agrees to log a new ticket.\n\nA few hours later I check my queue and see the new ticket. Low and behold the user has submitted the exact same information as the first ticket, Please configure a model A, but added a note that satsii has advised to log a new ticket.\n\nOnly in IT you deal with this level of stupidity and have users treat you like the idiot. Luckily for this user they are an internal department, otherwise they would be getting charged $250 for the inconvenience they caused.",

But something reminded me of it, so here I am.\n\nIt was a fairly miserable day; rain was lashing my home town, and from the weather reports, it was even worse further up the country. In retaliation, I shut the door to my office and put the real world - and it's unpleasant weather - at least two closed doors away.\n\nAlmost immediately, the desk phone rang. I dropped into my chair as I picked it up, logging in to my computer and opening my standard software packages even as I mindlessly regurgitated the company greeting.\n\n&gt; ME: Joe's Stockyard and Fine China, you broke it you bought it!\n\n&gt; Field Tech (FT): Hey G, how are you?\n\nI'd spent plenty of time on the phone with FT, and as luck would have it, he was located right about where the worst of the storm was.\n\n&gt; ME: Good man, good. How about you? Keeping indoors until the storm blows over?\n\n&gt; FT: I'm trying, man, I'm trying. Can you look up monitoring unit #12345?\n\n&gt; ME: Sure thing. Huh... Looks like it's currently offline; last message was at about 5 this morning.\n\n&gt; FT: Yeah, that's about what I figured, too.\n\n&gt; ME: Looks like the power went out at about 1 A.M. as well - think it might be storm related?\n\n&gt; FT: Yeah, I'd say so. But aren't the units meant to come with an internal battery to keep them online for at least 24 hours in the event of a power failure?\n\n&gt; ME: Yes. Yes, they are.\n\n&gt; FT: So what's going on? Is the unit faulty?\n\n&gt; ME: It's possible, but I doubt it - I'm pretty certain that something else is going on here. If the battery was faulty, it would have died in far less than four hours.\n\n&gt; FT: Well, the customer is jumping up and down about it. It's a pretty rural facility, but they think it's important, and they ARE the end customer, so...\n\n&gt; ME: Yeah, I hear that. Look, I don't think it's the unit, but the only way to be sure is to roll out and check. Just... you know. Be careful out there, and all that.\n\n&gt; FT: Oh, for sure. It's meant to clear up this afternoon, I'll head out once the storm starts to lift and give you a call once I'm on site.\n\nWith a plan in place, I leaned back in my office chair. Something about the timing was bothering me... I just couldn't put my finger on it.\n\nLacking better ideas, I pulled the physical copy of the paperwork from the unit's file. Tucked away, in the back of the file, was a single page, bearing little more than a couple of paragraphs and a signature. As I read the page, realization slowly dawned on me...  \n...but it was just a theory. A good one, to be sure; but I needed further evidence.\n\nI decided to wait until FT was on site to see if any new evidence that he might uncover would support or refute my hypothesis.\n\n---\n\nI didn't have to wait long.\n\n&gt; FT: Heya G!\n\n&gt; ME: Hey man - are you out there already?\n\n&gt; FT: Yeah, I got sick of sitting around watching the rain fall.\n\n&gt; ME: Huh - I didn't recognize the number you're dialing in on; looks like it's a landline?\n\n&gt; FT: Yeah, I lost coverage on my cell coming up the road. I would have been here earlier, but the road was blocked.\n\n&gt; ME: Oh?\n\n&gt; FT: Yeah, a tree fell across the road; took down some power lines - it's probably what caused the power outage. They're working on the power now; they've only just finished moving the tree out of the way.\n\n&gt; ME: So, wait - you're telling me that the only access road to this area was blocked, until just a few minutes ago?\n\n&gt; FT: Yeah.\n\n&gt; ME: And the power is still out? Has been for a good, what, twelve, fourteen hours?\n\n&gt; FT: Uh, yeah?\n\n&gt; ME: Just look back down the road. Can you see a cell tower?\n\n&gt; FT: N- Oh yeah, actually, there it is!\n\n&gt; ME: On this side of where the tree was?\n\n&gt; FT: Yeah. You going somewhere with this?\n\n&gt; ME: Yeah. One more question - open up the door to the unit, and tell me: are the lights still on?\n\n&gt; FT: They are, actually! How'd you know? And if the unit is all good, why is it showing as offline?\n\nI glanced at the single sheet of paper on my desk.\n\n&gt; ME: When the customer signed the connection contract, they also signed a contract variation - essentially, that they did not intend to make a phone line available for the unit to use as a back up communications path.\n\n&gt; FT: Wouldn't that mean that the unit can only communicate via the mobile network?\n\n&gt; ME: Exactly - the site is essentially at the whim of the cellular provider, which was spelled out to them in the variation that they signed. Fortunately, there's a tower just down the road, so they normally have excellent coverage, so it's not an issue.\n\n&gt; FT: ...except in this case?\n\n&gt; ME: Except in this case, where the power went down AND the access road was blocked, AND it was probably a Health and Safety violation just to drive out there in that storm. The unit lost power, true, and the battery kicked in and did exactly what it's meant to do. But the same thing happened at the cell tower, just down the road. The tower's batteries kicked in, and they keep it up for about four hours, which gives enough time for one of the cellular provider's technicians to get out there and run up a generator, or replace the batteries with freshly charged ones, or whatever their process is.\n\n&gt; ME: But with the access road blocked... Their tech couldn't get power to the tower. After four hours, it shut down, and everything went offline.\n\n&gt; FT: So... who pays for the call out - who do I send my bill to?\n\n&gt; ME: Well, the customer insisted that this was a priority and needed immediate attention. The customer is also the one that insisted on the variation to the standard contract, and knew that this might happen. And I've got their signature to prove it.\n\n&gt; FT: Sounds like a pretty solid case for billing the customer.\n\n&gt; ME: That's what I'm thinking.\n\n&gt; FT: But... the monitoring unit is still offline.\n\n&gt; ME: And there's nothing we can do about that, unless you can hook it into a phone line.\n\n&gt; FT: Man, I wouldn't even know where to start.\n\n&gt; ME: Then all we can do is wait for the cellular network to come back online.\n\n---\n\nAbout two hours later, the monitoring unit disappeared from the real-time list of offline units. I double-checked, and sure enough, it had come back online as soon as the network was back up - it had required no direct human intervention at all.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the customer paid the bill without significant protest.",

        "text": "**[Timeline](https://redd.it/6v3az8) of my other stories separated by company.**\n\n***\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLife, overtime, and the holidays kept me from having any time to actually sit down and write and post some more of the stories I’ve been wanting to share for a while. It’s also been a while since I wrote about $Senseless too, and I promised many more stories about him. Well, you’re in luck. This one is about him. As you all know, $Senseless isn’t the sharpest tool in the shed.\n\nThis happened on Saturday. I was just relaxing at home getting over a cold, and watching movies on my Plex while my daughter plays next to me when my phone starts ringing. Of course, it’s $Senseless. It’s close to noon, so I know something has to be up as he usually only calls when something broke… Or when he gets his car stuck and forgets his insurance’s roadside assistance number.\n\n&gt; **$Me**: What did you break this time?  \n&gt; **$Senseless**: I didn’t break anything!  \n&gt; **$Me**: Uh huh.  \n&gt; **$Senseless**: I swear, I didn’t… but, uh, I need to you come over and look at something. My computer is being stupid.  \n&gt; **$Me**: Oh, for fsck sake, really? What did you do now?  \n&gt; **$Senseless**: Nothing! I swear! But my computer is missing everything!  \n&gt; **$Me**: Uh huh, sure you didn’t do anything. Give me an hour. You’re paying for my gas and lunch.\n\nI already know he broke something, so I grab my tech bag and refill my travel mug with coffee and head to his place. Once I arrive, I start prodding to figure out what the hell he did. Of course, $Senseless allegedly has no idea what happened.\n\nI have him log in and I notice there is nothing on his desktop, start menu, and OneDrive isn’t set up anymore. So I start digging around to see what’s up.\n\n&gt; **$Senseless**: Yeah, dude, I was just poking around in the settings--  \n&gt; **$Me**: What? Why? I told you never to do that without me.  \n&gt; **$Senseless**: I didn’t do anything! I was just trying to adjust mouse speed when all of a sudden Windows is reinstalling!  \n&gt; **$Me**: *slams face into his desk* Are you serious?! You deliberately had to have done that. And obviously you didn’t choose the “Keep your files” option either. I’ll fix this, but you’re buying me pizza instead of fast food.\n\nThat’s right. He somehow navigated through the Windows settings and reinstalled Windows through the Recovery panel and did *not* choose to keep his files. The good news for him is that I created a full backup to an external when I visited the week prior, so I installed the backup software I use and recovered all of his stuff except OneDrive. For that, I just had him log in so it could do its thing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: $Senseless is still a moron. I get pizza out of the deal. Why am I still friends with this guy?\n",

        "text": "I've told this story before elsewhere. tl;dr at the bottom.\n\n**Background**\n\nWe have a newly-built three-host VMware vCenter cluster backed with a combination of a VNXe3150 and (very sadly) a Windows 2008 R2 server as an iSCSI mountpoint for the much less critical storage; backup are via Veeam as B2D2T (UGH!). After much wailing and gnashing of teeth the design - including monitoring and both VM and storage failover - has been configured and tested. We're shaking out the design, but it's working as advertised. My design, my build, and it works!\n\n**Situation**\n\nI get an email from my (non-PHB type) boss reporting that the monitoring system is going insane and vCenter itself isn't stating online. What the hell, it's a Saturday afternoon, it's cold outside, and I'm bored and tired.\n\nLog into the VPN, take a look around for a few hours, determine the issue's cause is kind of simple - the log retention is over-running the MSDE database size (max 10GB) because I neglected to take this into account. But to fix it requires vCenter to be online, and that's not happening because... you see the catch-22 it's in.\n\n**Solutions**\n\nAlthough vCenter is down and the alerting system is going nuts (all the Opsview monitoring points to vCenter services, which is down and red-lighting the place) there's no real danger of production data loss. If there's a host failure we can manually fail over the VM guests and clean it up later.\n\n Copy and paste the URL to the email for fixing it via root login and CLI and tell Boss either he can do it or I can, but if it's me I'd rather wait until I'm on-site to look at it.\n\nHe emails back he's going to shut down the monitoring system and wait for me to get back, knowing full well I'm unavailable for at least two months... \n\n*Two months??!* I can hear you say. Well, yes. I got the \"can you look at this\" email less than twenty-four hours after I got home from having open heart surgery.\n\n\n**tl;dr**: Get an outage email from my boss because system is down and even at half-dead I'm still smarter than he is.\n\n**EDIT for clarification** This incident took place in 2013; I'm completely fine these days.",

The school in question also pays from it's own budget for a lower level tech for a few hours each day.  This other tech takes care of most of the minor problems that occur and I get the more problematic ones.\n\n\nAnyway, the other tech has left for the day and this happened.\n\nCharacters in this story\n\n$madman - me the crazy tech\n\n$til - teacher who is a IT liason and helps with basic IT stuff.  Sometimes this person 'thinks' they know about IT and mess everything up.  Luckily, this one actually knows when to stop and ask a real IT person.\n\n$sub - a substitute teacher filling in for the usual teacher.\n\n$til - hey $madman, can you have a look at this, I'm not sure what the issue is but $sub can't get anything showing on the TV (note, this school had a load of large TV's installed in some rooms with a control panel over the summer - it's better and cheaper than the projectors they had before).\n\n$madman - sure, lead on, I was just updating site documentation and I need a break.\n\nWe walk over and $til explains that $sub can't get anything to show, either from the computer or the elmo (document camera).  I'm wondering what cable mess has been created as the elmo can go directly into an input but can also be inline with the computer.  This room had an older iMac which the TV's don't also pick up unless you remove the miniport adapter from the back of the adapter and plug it back in.  $til knows these tricks so I'm wondering what on earth occurred as $til knows this trick and most of the other 'usual' problems.\n\nOn entering the room the entire class looks at us and I instantly spot the problem....  $sub explains the issue and I listen while looking for a tape dispenser.\n\n$madman - \"give me a minute\",  I get a short length of tape and walk to the TV.  I then tape a wire back onto the front of the tv, lean over to the control box and switch the TV on - everything bursts into life and $til, $sub and the class are amazed.\n\n$madman - (to $til and $sub) - the IR transmitter that is linked to the control panel had fallen off (the glue the contractors used was not strong).  I attached it back with the tape and you should be fine now.\n\n$sub and $til are amazed it was so simple and I get a small round of applause from a class of 3rd graders.\n\nAfter myself and $til leave the room and I give a longer explanation to $til so she knows what to look for in the future.  In any case, it further improved my reputation a good tech at that site which is always nice as they try to include me when nice food appear or school staff get a treat.\n\nAnyway, a simple problem, a simple fix and a happy set of people - that was a good day.",

I show up, no intention of charging him anything since this was just a \"you need this adapter\" consultation.  Yup, needed a vga to hdmi adapter.\n\nSo I explain how to hook it up. \n\n\"OK, since it has a new power cable I am going to disconnect and remove the old power cord. But we will keep your old video cord, plug it into the adapter and then into your monitor.\"\n\n He stared at me like I had misplaced my hat with a live lobster.  \"But if we use two power cords...wait I don't understand\"\n\n I have already forgotten most of the conversation,  but it seems that to him the concept of using one cord for video and one for power was witchcraft.

        "text": "Hi TFTS,  I don't think I've posted this one before, and I'm having a slow night.\n\n---\n\nIn this tale I'm working in a server support role, one step removed from the front line.  We don't deal with the end users at all, and L1 don't have server access.  We take a look at our side once L1 has done everything they can do on their side.  L2 don't even have phone numbers.\n\n---\n\nA user has been in contact because he isn't receiving emails, but he can send.  L1 send him a test to verify his story before sending us the ticket. They include a screenshot to \"show\" the missing email.  Cheers guys, super helpful.  Some of our L1 techs can be very basic.\n\n\nNow, usually this kind of thing has a simple cause and is an easy fix, but by the time I get my hands on the ticket it's passed through two other L2 techs and gone back to L1 multiple times.  Every time the user has told the L1 he still isn't getting anything.  Nobody can find anything wrong.  I read through the notes and my colleagues have checked everything I was thinking of checking.  With no new knowledge to offer, I resort to re-checking their work.  No rules on the mailbox, no faults on the account, he's using the webmail client, mail tracking shows the test emails working as intended, delivery receipts show a success, and I can see the count of inbox items increasing on the server.  The last tech was clearly out of ideas too, as he was suggesting a full mailbox recreation.   I read again, have I missed anything?  Apparently it used to work fine but suddenly stopped.  \n\n\nThe only thing I can do now is log in as the user and look for myself, but we don't talk to the users, and we can't reset or use a user account without explicit approval and an agreed time, which can take a day or two to arrange because L1 are the single point of contact and we aren't even on the same site.  This poor guy hasn't had emails for days or weeks.  I couldn't bring myself to bounce it around yet again to get this approval.  And even if it did work for me, why doesn't it work for him?\n\n\nI'm stumped.  I think again about all the possible basic issues that can occur with a bad user.  I was trained in a healthcare environment so I've seen a lot. We're dependent on L1 weeding those out, but this particular L1 tech didn't seem very thorough... \n\n\nAs a last resort I open up the screenshot for scrutiny.  It's a full screen that looks like it's been saved in Paint and copied into a Word doc.  I zoom in but the compression is so bad I can't make out any text.  I squint at the shapes of blurry words and compare it to my own webmail.\n\n\nCould it be?\n\n\nNo...\n\n\n&gt;Worknotes:  \n&gt;L1, the emails in the screenshot appear to be sorted by the \"Subject\" column.  Please talk the user through changing this to \"Sort by Date\" and see if the missing emails become visible.\n\n\nI make a note of the ticket number and check it the next day.\n\n\n&gt;Worknotes: \n&gt;Contacted user. Issue resolved.\n\n\nI flag the ticket for a quality review.  My coffee smiles at me.\n\n---\n\nTLDR:  I'm sorry Mr Johnson, we can't find any reason for your hands to be the colour you say they are, they look fine whenever we take a look.  By the way, is that cranberry sauce on your glasses?\n",

        "text": "I'm currently on a new contract at a major aviation company. (And no I don't think I've run into u/zeewolfeh, he'd be flight line and I stay the hell away from that mess in my nice cubical above the factory floor. And that assumes we're even at the same place which I doubt.) I don't actually work for said company, I'm contracted to the supplier of their Hell brand PCs. The supplier of those PCs also holds the support contract for most, but not all of the PCs this company runs. Most issues are simple break/fix or restore type problems. Most of the PCs here are supported by a different support team with around 30 or so left for my team. My team (being the team I belong to as I don't manage it) is only supposed to support front end machines for the big manufacturing equipment, like the CNC machines.\n\nThat all changed the day ~~the fire nation attacked~~ someone “browed” one of our computers and dragged it off to what is called the wire shop. (It’s where they make wiring harnesses) We didn’t find out why until yesterday. The PC is being used to manage/control a piece of industrial hardware. Not long after they “obtained” this PC it started to BSoD so they called our manager and demanded that someone be sent over, that someone ended up being me. Because the wire shop is a ten minute drive, with no shuttle or anything to take me over there I drove over and planned on staying until my shift was over then going home. \n\nAll goes well and after a little wandering around I find the desk where this PC was located. I had tried to call the person who reported the problem and had scheduled the meeting but she had apparently forgot and left around noon that day so it was a little more difficult to find her desk than it should have been. But I locate the PC and start to hook it up when two techs from an entirely different support team walk up and take the PC and leave with it. Thinking this is now someone else’s problem and relax for a little while before leaving a little early.\n\nBecause this is TFTS you know this is not how the story ends. This other team proceeded to replace every last bit of hardware (because they can bill more that way) inside the case, like power supply to power button. Then return it to the user (who it turns out is the IT support staff for the industrial machine) who reloads the proprietary software and hooks it back up to the wire machine. It runs for some amount of time and BSoD. So she emails me wanting me to come out and fix it. Not a problem I’ll go over and get the dump and event logs and see if I can figure out why this one machine is having problems because this can’t possibly be a hardware issue. She ends up emailing me the logs, saving me a drive over, and I start to look at them but don’t make much progress before the end of the day.\n\nThe next morning her boss happens to stop by wanting to know why this is taking so long. I explain that we just got the newest logs late yesterday and that we haven’t finished reviewing them yet but that we can’t find anything that would indicate a hardware failure. That combined with the fact that the hardware was all replaced makes us believe that this is a software issue and is likely out of scope for our team. The manager then says that sort of makes sense because the PC the machine manufacture brought out was older and it worked fine but wants us to continue looking to see if we can pinpoint an exact cause if possible.\n\nOne of my co-workers then asks a very important question, “Are there any other computers hooked up to these machines that aren’t having this issue?” It turns out every single one of the PCs that are being used with these machines are having the exact same problem. I look at the manager and tell him that this has to be a software issue, and that it is a problem with the vender’s control software not working with our image. He says that they will have the vender out in a few days and asks if we can send someone out to meet with them when they get there. \n\nToday we are informed that the vender will be on site around 9am so myself and my team lead drive over to talk with the vender. Once inside we locate the PC and the vender that is working on the wire machine and introduce ourselves where we find out that the tech the vender sent out is only there to setup new hardware. He knows nothing about software or blue screens. The software guy will be here on Tuesday, next week. We have just wasted at least half a day. So we leave, get lunch and go back to our nice cubicles where I find and email wanting an update on what my team is doing to fix this problem because it can’t possibly be the vender’s software.\n\nI’m so glad I started applying to other companies last week.",

        "text": "**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**$Selben** - Previous Tier 1 tech support now an IT contractor - a bit more into his career.\n\n**$Soda** - Entrepreneur and IT Consultant, and in a way $Selben’s boss. Extremely knowledgeable IT guru. Previously worked with $Selben at $SmallerCompany until they decided to move on.\n\n**$Sup2** -  All around great supervisor, worked his way up from the support line, understands how the helpdesk works. Worked with $Soda in the past.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt was the holiday season, and the one of the supervisors of $BiggerCompany had approved time off for just about everyone, including himself. This left $Sup2 in a sticky situation. He was an old acquaintance of $Soda, and quickly hired him and $Selben on for some super short term temp work. The contract was about two weeks - not ideal, but it paid the bills! \n\nThere was only one other tech in the office other than $Sup2, so $Soda and $Selben were covering the phones and doing everything else that came up to the best of their abilities.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n$Selben was in his cubicle. The previous occupant of the desk was apparently a big snacker, as the keys in his keyboard frequently crunched. Several attempts to smack the keyboard against a trashcan had little effect to remove the chips and other crumbs. $Selben's phone began to ring.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Thank you for calling, this is $Selben. How can I help you?\n\n&gt; $User: I can’t login to $CompanySystem!\n\n&gt; $Selben: Oh I see. What error are you getting?\n\n&gt; $User: No Inter…Net… connection!\n\n&gt; $Selben: Can you check to see if you have internet?\n\n&gt; $User: I don’t, I’ll try the WiFi…\n\nA few moments later…\n\n&gt; $User: It’s working now. Thanks!\n\n&gt; $Selben: No problem?\n\nMost of the calls were pretty simple. A few reports had to be moved from an excel document into a special format from the system, and $Selben was also tasked with those. $Soda was happy to inform $Sup2 of ALL the different things $Selben was good at, but it felt more embarrassing than anything else for $Selben. $Soda worked the phones as well, pulling up his charm whenever someone was upset and generally just being $Soda. \n\nNear the end of the week it seemed more and more employees had gone on vacation and the call queues finally died down, dropping to maybe one or two calls a day which was a nice change.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne early morning $Selben entered the office, hoping to get a head start on his day. $Soda popped out of the IT area and locked eyes with him. Something was wrong! \n\n&gt; $Soda: Come with me, we’ve got a level 5 ticket!\n\n&gt; $Selben: Level 5?! I thought it only went to 4?\n\nHe spun around and followed $Soda.\n\n&gt; $Soda: $Sup2 said to take you with me, we tried rebooting a critical piece of equipment but no power, nothing!\n\n&gt; $Selben: Did you try a different outlet?\n\n&gt; $Soda: Yep, still nothing. It's dead. $Sup2 wants us to go get a replacement immediately! I'll need your help to get it in the van.\n\nThey rushed out to one of the company vehicles. ~~$Selben slid across the hood and dove through the passenger side window.~~ They got into the vehicle and started driving.\n\n$Soda continued explaining all the different steps they took to try to fix it the critical piece of equipment, but it was completely dead. At a red light $Soda pulled out his rapidly dinging phone. He had a flurry of texts from $Sup2 updating him of the situation.\n\n&gt; $Soda: A quarter dozen tickets have already come in. We've gotta hurry!\n\nThey pulled into the parking lot of the vendor and headed in. $Sup2 had already organized picking it up over the phone, so they only had to sign some papers before loading it up. They rushed back to the office and carried it inside. One of the front desk admins held the door open for them.\n\n&gt; $DeskAdmin: Hurry!\n\nThey quickly went and pulled out the old piece of equipment and installed the replacement. Several users stood around and watched. They heard the slight hum of the machine starting up. A sigh of relief came across the room. One user walked up and gasped.   \n\n&gt; $User: It's not compatible!\n\nThey held up a critical component. $Soda ran off and returned with a pair of scissors, and cut down the component to the new, smaller required size. The room stood in awe as he worked. He slowly installed it in the device, and pressed the button to activate it. The burble and sizzle began. Everyone let out a cheer. $Sup2 held up his mug.\n\n&gt; $Sup2: Good work, guys!\n\nThings had been very slow, and unfortunately the office coffee maker had died, leaving the skeleton crew in the office caffeine-less. $Sup2 jokingly created a “Level 5\" ticket, and sent $Selben and $Soda to get a replacement. It was a pretty big piece of equipment, as it was one of those industrial grade types. After plugging it back in, they discovered a different sized filter was needed, so $Soda cut down one of the old ones to get the coffee maker working.\n\nEdits: Did some quick edits I missed ;)",

Let me double check on a few things about this application, and I'll remote in.\n\nWhile pulling up the article in our KB about this application, I begin remoting in. I confirm that this app authenticates with AD, and check that they have the correct memberships.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, as Windows Remote is loading their desktop, I see the login page but note that something seems odd. After confirming that they have access, I turn my full attention to the user's desktop. Then begin to show me how they can't click into the user ID or password fields. I glance at the top of the page to double check they are on the correct page...\n\nWindows Photo Viewer\n\n&gt;$me: That's... Not the login page...\n\n&gt;$user: It isn't?\n\n&gt;$me (trying not to laugh, and being as polite a possible): No, it appears that you have a screenshot of the login page.\n\n&gt;$user: A what? What is that? \n\n&gt;$me (still trying not to laugh, while still trying to be polite): An image, or picture. That's not the actual page you log into. See how it says \"Windows Photo Viewer\"? This is just a picture of the login page. That's why you are unable to enter your user ID or password.\n\n&gt;$user: Oh, well how to I log in?\n\nCut to me, having already *opened an actual web browser* and entered the correct URL, and logged into the website thanks to the automated password management system.\n\n&gt;$me: You are already in! Your $passwordmanager was already set up with the credentials and you are good to go! Would you like me to create a short cut on your desktop?\n\n&gt;$user: If you wouldn't mind, that would he great.\n\nI then set up the short cut, and ask them where they got the image that they were trying to log in to. They explain that it was provided to them by their manager.\n\n&gt;$me: How were you getting to this image?\n\nWhile on the desktop, they move the cursor to an icon on the desktop...\n\n1.PNG\n\nI chuckle, and tell them that they are good to go. They thank me for my help, I give them the $genericclosingstatment and disconnect the call. \n\nHead, meet desk, as I bust up laughing and tell everyone within earshot, who then also bust up laughing.\n\nEdit: A word",

        "text": "Following [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7pqjft/the_tale_of_how_windows_update_broke_our_gpos/dsjb7vq/) I had to write this tale. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI used to work for a large, national company as Level 1 tech support, helping out corporate employees with their point of sale (POS) systems. We had around 6000 locations to support, with 40 agents during the day. This is a tale of how having your Level 3 support bidding on the support contract your company has with the customer can turn out less than ideal. The relationship between the helpdesk and Level 3 support was quite hostile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOur level 3 tech support released an updated software version along with new printing system with new messages on the screen when performing certain transactions to help users as to when to insert the document in the printer's manual feed. It seemed like a GREAT idea at the time.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n... But it wasn't. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe print driver they pushed out to ALL the locations was extremely buggy, causing a lot of issues when printing documents, with an error on the printer. When the printer errored out, users couldn't get out of the print message confirmation, which looped, and probably caused a huge backlog of customers at busier locations.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt resulted in an unheard of high call volume. I'm talking about 40 agents on the phone with one user, for over an hour, with 40 calls waiting in queue, all. Day. Long. Not just a 15 minute spike that clears in an hour. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOur level 3 tech support gave us procedures to uninstall and reinstall the print driver to resolve this problem, but the process was over an hour long at first. Due to busted SLA's with the client, we got bashed on for breaching it for months. Management went back to the client explaining them the process that we were given by THEIR 3rd level support (different company than the one i directly worked for, partly owned by the client).  Our management got reprimanded, they calmly explained to the client that this was because the helpdesk was given a very lengthy procedure to fix the snafu orignally created by Level 3 support. I imagine the client went back to our Level 3 support and asked them for a better fix. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA month later or so, we're given a new process to follow that now takes 45 minutes. Still not good enough. We get yelled at again, we explain it's, once again, Level 3's fault. If we even deviated slightly from that process, Level 3 sends us the tickets back with a fee for wasted time (I suppose it was for wasted time, since a process was put in place, but not followed).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThey sent us back a lot of tickets to rework on because some of our agents weren't that good at following instructions black on white. \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nA couple of months later the calls went back to a normal level. Level 3 made t he print messages more concise and, I believe, pushed out a new printers. If this had properly been tested beforehand, none of it would have happened, but instead, our company got slammed with fines for busted SLA's and incomplete tickets. \n\n*****\nTL;DR: Having a 3rd level support as a competitor is less than ideal without a testing environment.\n*****\nEDIT: Formatting and details.",

They should be able to set you up pretty soon. \n\n&gt; $User - So can you tell me why this is happening?\n\n&gt; $Me - W... well you plugged in a space heater on a mains line not rated to handle it. \n\n&gt; $User - The last time this happened I was told not to use THAT space heater anymore. So I went out and bought a newer model. \n\n...\n\n\n&gt; $user - Are you there?\n\n&gt; $Me - So you have had this happen before? You know that space heaters are relatively the same technology they were 20 years ago right? Electricity shoots through coils and generates heat. Buying a newer model will not change the fact that they require 400-800 watts of power. Plugging it into a mains line that has your network closet hooked up is a huge no no. \n\nFacilities got her branch working again quite quickly, thankfully, but not before giving her an earful. ",

First time poster, Long time lurker here.\n\nDuring the summer of 2016, I was working tech support for a city, basically supporting white collars with computer problems and maintaining the servers. We were a small IT team of 4. Our manager (who is VERY knowledgeable as he was a technician for a good amount of years before being promoted), the technician that was there before me, the intern, and yours truly.\n\nOur printers were being pushed out by GPO based on the AD OU. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne day, one user calls me saying all his printers disappeared. I walked up to their desk and confirmed they were gone. Ran gpupdate but still no printers. I confirmed the printer GPO was being applied correctly. I ran gpupdate /force and the printers came back on, but disappeared again shortly after. I had to add the printers manually. Problem fixed, I thought. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs i get back to my desk we start being bombarded with calls of everyone having the same problem. We figured this couldn't be local to the user's machine. Me and $manager are going frantically through our GPO's to try and figure out the problem. We even created new GPO's. The event logs were silent on our domain controller. \n\nWe thought we had the situation under control by the end of our shift. Boy, were we ever wrong!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nQueue the next morning, and the same problem occurs. We run frantically around the office, remoting to the other sites we have (Library, Arena, etc.) to fix the problem on whoever's reporting the problem. Certain users weren't affected, however. The other tech is looking through logs of our domain controller frantically trying to pinpoint the cause of the issue.\n\n\nLunch time comes by and I'm browsing a news source by myself at the office and I stumble on an article about a Windows update that b0rked printer deployment via GPO. Confirmed the computers had the Windows update were affected and informed the other technician, who was responsible for our WSUS server. Once the troublesome update was removed, all our printer woes went away.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL;DR Browsing the web during lunch hour can be productive!",

Not a generic windows printer test page, but a unique one printed from Notepad that gives his name, the time, and the network name of the printer.\n\nSo I send the test page, and ask the user if he got it. I ask him to verify that it's the exact same information as on the notepad text document on his computer. Please somebody tell me, why would a user lie about getting their test page?\n\nWell I'm troubleshooting another printer in another building, and I do the same thing. Another user goes and says they got a test page... but the timestamp isn't what I was looking for. And they read off the information from the liar's test page. His name, the name of printer, all of it. So when I was helping the first dude, and asked him if he got the test page, there was no way he actually got it. It was sent to a different building. My inventory notes were wrong, so I mapped him to the wrong printer.\n\nSo I think that I will be taking the documentation from this incident and having a little chat with the user's supervisor.

A week into starting at my current company, I found that a major vendor's support website was not tracking our assets. I couldn't believe it, so I took several laptops, pulled the SNs from the BIOS, and copy-pasted them into the support site. When that didn't work, I manually typed them, multiple times.\n\nI alerted Jon to this problem in an email and was told that was impossible. So I took screenshots and showed him myself. He still \"wasn't convinced it was happening.\"\n\nFast forward. Months ago, for a migration project, Jon has ordered several wireless mouse/keyboard combos from the same major vendor and they are godawful, with a failure rate right now of over 5%. To make things worse, you have to pair BOTH to the receiver it came with and you can't reprogram the receivers for new keyboards. In short, they're a bad product.\n\nShockingly, another user's mouse broke today. It was the scroll wheel, and it is the third one with a scroll wheel issue. First, Jon told me to repair it. I explained you can't fix 10 dollar wireless mice. You replace them. Jon's solution (since he hadn't, of course, ordered more when we ran out)? Use a receiver from one of the broken mice/keyboards for the mouse and totally different one for the keyboard. It works I guess.\n\nHere's the problem: they're all either broken mice or broken keyboards, so I have to sort through them to find the mice that are not, which is fine. But I tell Jon this. Jon's response? \"I'm not convinced they're actually broken.\"\n\nI contacted three recruiters this morning. I'm not convinced I want to work here anymore.",

We also provided support once they were sold that was part of the contract.  We rotated who was next to fly out, that person would take the support calls until one came that required onsite support.  Then we would escalate the service call through the contracts office, book our travel, and fly out that evening to be on site the next morning.  \n\nI got a call from an Air Force TSgt that his F16 Ordnance System trainer wasn't booting up.  We had a checklist to go through with the customer, checking that breakers weren't tripped (each one called out by me and verified by caller), the power sequencer cable was fully seated, supply breakers to the wall power, etc.  Went through all that and it still wasn't powering, so went through escalation and I got to swing by the house to pick up my suitcase and head for the airport.\n\nThere are several internal failures and external causes that could create this problem, I got to see most of them working that job for 5.5 years.  This wasn't one of them.  I met my contact, walked into the room, and immediately spotted the problem.  I casually walked over, flipped ***on*** the main power breaker for the power sequencer, and then hit the start button.  \n\nThe look of shock and embarrassment was priceless.  He immediately acknowledged that we had spoken about that very breaker and he just brain-farted.  I did the Very Good Customer Service Thing, and made up some cause that was easy to miss but crucial to operation.  And spent the next two days going over the rest of our equipment onsite to make sure it was all good.\n\nTLDR:  Customer checked something without really checking it during phone troubleshooting.",

        "text": "I was working on an SA team that managed the dev/test servers for a handful of Very Important Projects for a Fortune 500 megacorp, one of many SA teams there. USER had been working there for over a decade, and should have known how everything worked.\n\nOne Saturday morning, I got a page that said nothing but \"what is the status of my ticket?\" I called USER back and had roughly this conversation:\n\n&gt;me: Can you give me the ticket number, so I can look it up?\n\n&gt;user: I don't know my ticket number, you tell me my ticket number. Why is this taking so long? We're dead in the water until this is fixed, it's been 12 hours since I opened the ticket.\n\n&gt;me: 12 hours ago would have been 8pm on Friday, so nobody would have been in the office to see you opened a ticket. Who did you talk to about it?\n\n&gt;user: I didn't talk to anybody, I opened a ticket, the way I've always done. You should be monitoring that queue for issues at all times.\n\n&gt;me: OK, I'm looking at the queue, and I'm not seeing any tickets that came in since yesterday afternoon. The system would have sent you an email with the ticket number, do you have that email?\n\n&gt;user:Look, stop stalling and fix my problem.\n\n&gt;me:OK, I've done a search on the system for tickets opened by you, and it appears you opened a ticket in a completely different queue. So that's why I didn't see it; you didn't send it to us. I'll take a look and call you back when I know something.\n\n&gt;user:It shouldn't matter what queue I open a ticket in, you should be monitoring that 24/7 for issues.\n\n&gt;me:well we're not a 24/7 staffed team, we work regular business hours, we have an oncall for after-hours issues (as she damn well knew, since she paged me) and in any event we wouldn't monitor the other 500 queues, we'd only see things that come to us.\n\n&gt;user:well you need to fix that, it shouldn't matter what queue or when I open the ticket, you need to make sure that any time I open a ticket somebody starts working on it immediately.\n\n&gt;me:OK, I'll pass your suggestion to my manager.\n\n&gt;user:no, don't \"pass my suggestion\" to your manager, you need to take care of this right now.\n\n&gt;me:You want me, personally, to staff three shifts of people seven days a week to monitor 500 ticket queues just in case you open a ticket after hours in the wrong queue?\n\n&gt;user:yes, that is what I want.\n\n&gt;me:OK, I'll get right on that after I look into your issue.\n\n&gt;user:OK. How long will it take to fix my problem?\n\n&gt;me:Oh I already see the problem; you typed one letter in your script name wrong. It's scriptName.ksh not scriptName.sh.\n\n&gt;user:well either should work.\n\n&gt;me:OK. I'll pass that suggestion along to RedHat. I'll close your ticket once the other team passes it to us.\n",

However, I am a computer fanatic and my family knows this. And I'm sick and have nothing to do. So you can guess who my family went and found whenever they had a question\n\nI go outside of my quarantine area to visit with family once the meds kicked in and my Grandma walks by and mentions that she got a new smart phone...\n\n...oh no.\n\nyou see, we already gave her a smart phone. She tried to use it after I walked her through how and ended up \"losing\" it after getting frustrated with it. I have no idea why she got another after that experience.\n\nShe says that she turns on her phone, and it flashes the manufacturer and the carrier like usual, but it has a 3rd boot screen that she has to fight with before she can use the phone. I reluctantly tell her that I'll take a look at it.\n\nShe hands it to me and I go to my room to reboot it. It flashes the manufacturer, carrier, and then goes to the lock screen.\n\nYou might've put 2 and 2 together at this point, but I'm sick and probably a lil dehydrated at this point so I'm scratching my head trying to figure out what the hell she was talking about. So I turn off the phone and pull her aside. I hit that power button, hoping for answers. We get to the lock screen and she goes \"There! That's the one I was talking about.\"\n\nI fought that facedesk as hard as I could and explained what a lock screen was. I put a little message on it telling her to swipe to unlock and went to see what other hopefully more normal things she had in mind...\n\nEDIT: I have the best words\n\n",

She told me that she hadn't been on the work campus in sometime and this is just what she is use to.\n\nHad her connect to VPN, locked the screen, had her type in new password, and it unlocked the computer successfully. Disconnected VPN, had her logout of computer, and she was able to login back in using the new password. Had her connect to VPN and nothing was prompting for her password anymore, GPO's were being succesfully passed over VPN, network drives no longer needed passwords, everything is good.\n\n\n",

        "text": "I have a senior friend who likes to watch old movies on Netflix. \n\nSometimes, there are movies that he can't find because of Netflix's small catalog, so he always asks me to download old movies (legally) and load it on his tablet.\n\nI did that for a while and he was happy. One day, the tablet ran out of storage but he didn't want to delete some of the movies because they were too good and he likes to rewatch them. I explained  that the tablet has a limited storage, and that I could buy a secondary memory card and have him swap the cards. He refused and wanted to buy a second tablet because he had a hard time removing the SD card from the tray. So I did.\n\nEventually, the second tablet also ran out of space (as predicted by Einstein), so I offered to install a Western Digital NAS on his network that can store thousands of movies. The tablet could stream from it. \n\n---\n\n&gt;**Me**: Another option is to install a storage device in your house so your tablet will connect to it and play the movie from there, instead of playing the file from your tablet. You won't notice a difference. It'll be similar to how you've always watched movies, now without worrying about running out of space.\n\n&gt;**Him**: Hey, that's a good idea! How many movies can it hold?\n\n&gt;**Me**: About 4,000! Just as always, you'll call and let me know what movies you want, then I'll call you back few days later and let you know once the movies are uploaded. You won't have to physically bring your tablet to me.\n\n&gt;**Him**: Perfect! Buy me one and install it, please.\n\n--\n\n*I install the NAS, load the existing movies from his tablet to cloud, install an app that supports local network storage, create a shortcut so all he has to do is to tap on the icon and see the list of the movies.*\n\n--\n\n&gt;**Me**: It's all done. Look, here are all the movies. You do everything the same way, but now you use this icon instead of that.\n\n&gt;**Him**: Nice! Thank you! I'll call you when I need more movies!\n\n*He calls me, I load the movies, he watches them. It works fine.*\n\n*A week later*\n\n&gt;**Him**: You know, you said this cloud thing can have thousands of movies.\n\n&gt;**Me**: Yes, it has plenty of storage to hold all the movies you want.\n\n&gt;**Him**: Then where are they? I only see a few.\n\n&gt;**Me:**: *(I connect to the cloud over my phone to verify the movies are there)*. I see the movies. If you couldn't see them on your screen, I'll come over and troubleshoot the network. \n\n&gt;**Him**: No no,  I do see those on my tablet too. I mean, why are there so few movies?\n\n&gt;**Me**: ...th.. those are the ones you asked me to download, right?\n\n&gt;**Him**: Oooooh. Do you mean it's not like Netflix? YOU MEAN I HAVE TO TELL YOU EVERY TIME I NEED A MOVIE SO YOU'LL UPLOAD IT TO MY CLOUD? IT'LL TAKE FOREVER TO HAVE 4,000 MOVIES, MAN!\n\n&gt;**Me**: .......ehmm.. just like before, you tell me what movie you want and I'll load it to your cloud. It's simpler now because you don't have to bring your tablet all the way to my place. You still have to tell me what movies you want, just like before.\n\n&gt;**Him**: Ooooooh noooooo, man. You should be more careful while describing things. I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE NETFLIX! \n\n--\n\nI will never offer anything related to technology to an old person again. \n",

        "text": "So I used to work in the industry of home automation, also known as custom integration. I worked for one of the most high-end companies in the United States. We installed the type of systems where you arrived home, go to the touch screen mounted in your garage, and touch a button that says \"I'm home\". That turns the lights on, opens or closes the blinds, turns on music, heats up the hot tub, or anything else you can think of you want to happen in your house. We designed and installed the systems where you can control any of the electronics or  appliances in your house from your phone or a touchscreen on the wall. We were typically responsible not only for your television and music systems, but also your internet, WiFi, and often lights and HVAC as well. Because of this, we were critically important tech support for our customers, typically the first people they call when anything is wrong with the Internet or any of their electronic systems. Since we were a high-end luxury company, we actually had 24-hour on-call support. Today's tale, however, is not an after-hours support call. \n\nMy day started getting interesting when, immediately after our weekly safety meeting, my supervisor came up to me and asked \"Hey Treereme, what are you doing today? Where are you going?\"\n\nAs it turns out, I had a troubleshooting call scheduled for the afternoon, but my morning was yet to be booked. I told him I was free for the morning, and his eyes lit up.\n\n\"Perfect, do you want to go work on the private jet?\"\n\nI did a slight double take and asked \"the jet?\"\n\n\"Yeah we have a *$movieserversystem* installed on a private jet.  When we start getting too many notification emails from the *$movieserversystem* company that the system has not updated or checked in in a while, or if the system is popping up notifications on the actual TVs, we have to go out to the airport and update the server. It happens to be on the ground at our local airport for a few hours this morning, want to go check it out?\"\n\nA little side note about this *$movieserversystem*. It is very expensive, and absolutely awesome. It consists of a large rack mount server that is full of massive hard drives, which connects over the network to players and disc drives. Every time you put a movie in the disc drive, it rips it to hard drive and stores it on the system. Additionally, when we install the system for you we will take your whole DVD collection and use our robot with multiple DVD drives to rip every one of your disks on to the system. When you want to watch a movie, the players have an awesome interface where you can quickly and easily navigate through your whole collection and play any movie. It really is the most slick interface for this type of system I've ever used, whether commercial or homebrew like KODI. In order to make this navigation experience uniform and complete, the server connects to the internet and downloads things like movie covers and previews and IMDb info for every movie. It also checks in regularly with the manufacturer and reports its health, it was really normal for the manufacturer to email us and tell us we had issues on a client's unit before any other symptoms would arise. \n\nSince the system on the private jet did not normally have an internet connection, we had to go out to the airport and plug it into the network so it could update and check-in.\n\nMy boss told me to make sure I had a box of Cat6 on my van with at least a hundred meters of wire in it, and gave me the contact info for someone I was supposed to meet at the airport. \n\nI am a total aviation nerd, and I fly various radio control and unpowered flight systems myself. Getting to go behind the scenes at a private jet company was a pretty exciting prospect. \n\nI loaded up the van and headed over to our local general aviation airport ( general aviation is everything except commercial airliner flying - private planes, news helicopters, private jets etcetera). It happens to be one of the most busy general aviation airports in the US, and has all sorts of awesome aircraft going in and out all the time. As I pulled into the back side of the airport, I could see all manner of small aircraft and private jets, including a beautiful shiny Mustang fighter that was rolled out for maintenance.\n\nI checked in with the jet company, and was given a guest badge. The maintenance manager came out to meet me, he had done this before and knew what we needed which was great, because he had already pulled the jet out and had it close enough to the hanger office that I could run a cable.\n\nWalking through the maintenance bay was awesome for someone into flying, there were a number of jets stored there and one which had an engine removed for maintenance. All of the tool boxes were incredibly organized, and the floor was amazingly clean. Definitely a dream place to work for any typical  mechanic.\n\nWe walked through the hanger and out onto the apron in front, where a large white jet was parked. The maintenance manager told me it was a Gulfstream G450, originally sold for approximately 40 million dollars and then upgraded with a luxury interior including our electronic systems.\n\nThe maintenance manager towed an electrical boost cart over to the plane with a little electric golf-cart tug thing and hooked the cables up to the belly of the plane, then pulled down the stairs. We put on shoe protector booties and ascended into the jet. It was surprisingly luxurious, but smaller than I expected in places. At 6 feet tall, I had to duck to get through the main door but could stand up straight inside. The maintenance manager turned left into the cockpit and flipped a few switches to turn the plane on. When he turned around he saw me staring in wonder, trying to take in everything I could see. \n\n\"Would you like to sit in the cockpit?\"\n\nThat phrase must have let the excitement of my inner 10 year old boy inside show through on my face, as he didn't even wait for an answer and just climbed out of my way and waved me in. It was surprisingly tight to get into the pilot seat, it's not like those big commercial airliners where you see a walkway that goes up to each seat. You literally have to carefully climb your way in, as the space between the seats is filled with switches and levers. The pilot seat was honestly more cramped than most compact cars I have driven. \n\nAfter letting me sit there for a few minutes identifying buttons and switches and just marveling at the intricacy of the cockpit, the manager pointed out a couple of covered switches and said \"here, lift those covers up and push in those three buttons.\"\n\nWith glee I did so, flipping up the clear plastic cover and pushing in each switch which caused it to light up.\n\n\"Okay, that should have turned on the AV system and the TVs, let's go check your stuff out.\"\n\nI extricated myself from the pilot seat and followed him aft. Despite the interior not being as large as a commercial jet, it was incredibly luxurious. Immediately when you walked in the door from the stairs, there was a golden Aztec themed medallion 2 feet across mounted to the bulkhead. The bulkhead, as well as much of the trim and accoutrements of the cabin were all wrapped in a stunningly beautiful walnut burl with a glossy smooth clear coat. The carpet was fluffy and luxurious under my feet. Metal trim everywhere was gold plated. The seats were covered in buttery soft coffee-colored leather. There were a couple of different seating arrangements, a pair of swiveling captains chairs faced each other and there was also a pair of couches. Each seating area had its own TV that could pop out of the woodwork beside it. Both were independently fed with players from the *$movieserversystem*, so two different movies could be watched at once. There were headphone jacks and also independent audio zones of the speakers. There was also a larger TV on the bulkhead at the front of the cabin, that was hooked into a better sound system so everyone onboard could watch the same movie. I checked the functions of the system, and everything is working great but it is prompting that it needs to check in via the Internet and update.\n\nI was shown a hidden cabinet beside one of the captain's chairs, after pulling off the panel which was attached by velcro I was greeted with a miniature AV rack, only eight units high and about 14 inches deep. It took me a few minutes to extract the rack and access the backside of it, as the space is understandably very tight in this situation. Once I get it open, I go grab the end of the cable out of my box of Cat6 and pull it up to the rack and terminate it. Then I secure the wire to the rack  with a couple of zip ties and have the maintenance manager lead me off the plane and over to the nearest internet connection, trailing the Cat6 wire across the tarmac behind me. 280 feet later, we make it into a little office off the side of the hangar doors. Inside is a grungy computer, used for entering maintenance  information and such by the mechanics. I disconnect it  from the network then plug in my cat 6, after cutting and terminating the second end. Then I head back to the jet to start the update.\n\nThe internet in the maintenance office was not particularly fast, so I got to hang out for 20 minutes with the maintenance manager while the system updated. He told me that the flight attendant loved our system, as before we installed it they had to contact the jet owner and find out what movies they would want on board before flying. Then they would have to maintain a library of movies on mini DV tapes. The tape player and system controls were located in a tight closet in the back of the jet, and were a pain to use. Additionally, everyone on the plane had to watch the same film. Now with our system, they had access to hundreds of movies and the flight attendant never had to do anything. \n\nDuring the update, a breeze came up. A terrifying mechanical screech started to resonate throughout the cabin. Apparently, when turbine engines are turned off they can still spin  in the wind but they don't have the oil lubrication that they should. This leads to absolutely horrifying sounds in the cabin as the turbines slowly turn, making grinding nails-on-chalkboard type noises inside the jet.\n\nOnce the internet update finished, I buttoned the system back up and tested all the functions. We shut down the jet (the manager let me hit all the switches, which was awesome) and closed it back up. Apparently we were just in time, I was told the jet needed to leave to start preparing for a trip to  South America in about 20 minutes. I wrapped up my cable and took one last good look as I left the hanger.\n \n\nI know this isn't a typical tech support tale with lusers and SLA drama, I'm not trying to be Tuxedo Jack or anything. But I thought it might be interesting to hear about a/v tech support in a really unconventional setting. \n\nTL;DR - updated a *$movieserversystem* on a very expensive private jet, got to be a little boy sitting in the cockpit.

        "text": "This story is about a coworker. A terribly incompetent one. We were stuck with him for months before he was finally fired. During his tenure his work quality ranged from \"decent\" to \"destructive\" and this first story is meant to show you how incompetent he was.\n\nHe was working on site that day. A user had opened a ticket for a laptop that wasn't connecting to the network. The user was actually pretty competent with computers so we were able to do some troubleshooting with his help and ended up determining that the problem were the network parameters.\n\nYou see, that client REFUSED to have a DHCP server so every frickin' piece of equipment had to be manually given network parameters and each building had a different subnetwork. The client had 15+ plus buildings. This is a topic for another story :/\n\nLet's introduce the actors:\n\nAndy: experienced IT tech support veteran\n\nTed: incompetent and just plain impossible to work with junior tech\n\nSo Ted was dispatched to fix the laptop. He just needed to change the network parameters, what could possibly go wrong? \n\nRight...\n\nSo he got to the user's office and tried to log in with the local administrator account. None of the passwords worked, he tried them all and there was no documentation about this specific laptop parameters in our asset manager. Ok, not good, but it can be fixed. Ted had a lot of tools on live CDs and some of those could be used to change the password (something my other techs did when necessary).\n\nTed called us and Andy answered the phone: they started discussing the issue and I could see Andy was getting agitated. I signaled to him to put the call on speaker. \n\nTed was refusing to use a specific tool to change the local admin password claiming he didn't know how to use it. Andy told him to look for the instructions online on a different computer. He also offered to guide him step by step and Ted refused.\n\nAnd then...\n\n&gt;Ted: I think I have a better solution. I could create an administrator profile on another computer, copy the folder on the laptop in C:/Documents and Settings and then access the laptop with that account!\n\n&gt;*stunned silence*\n\n&gt;Andy: Sorry, can you repeat that?\n\n&gt;Ted: *repeats* but I guess that wouldn't work?\n\n&gt;Andy: of course not! *proceeds to explain why* \n\n&gt;Ted: Oh yeah, I thought so. Should I format the pc then?\n\n&gt;Andy: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO how about you use that live cd tool like I just told you?\n\n&gt;Ted: *whines about not knowing how to use itfor the next 10 minutes*\n\nWhile they were arguing, I saw that another tech was working in the same building. I called him and asked him if he could please fix the laptop when he was done with his ticket. He did and it took him 10 minutes to change the admin's password, change the network parameters and hand the laptop to a happy user.\n\nTed was written up.\n",

        "text": "Hello, TFTS, I am your host, Bowling Alley Guy. Grab your PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and follow me, for we have a doozy of a tale today.\n\n* * *\n\nModern bowling centers have a lot of systems in them, all supposedly working together in harmony to give bowlers the chance to have some fun. Sure, they're not on the level of hundreds of PCs networked to a dedicated server room, but between the office computers, networking gear, POS computers, scoring computers and related hardware, several dozen pinsetting machines, HVAC systems, lighting circuits, arcade cabinets, etc, it's a heck of a lot of equipment to care for. And at *Undisclosed Location*, one tiny system caused one major headache for us mechanics.\n\nSo, way back during the dark ages of the mid 1970s when *Undisclosed Location* was built, there really weren't any solutions for portable two way communications for businesses, i.e. radios. Back then, the best methods for communicating between the front desk and mechanics in the back were either a phone, or an intercom. And because pinsetting machines are super loud when in use, the intercom became the universal method for alerting the mechanics to an issue.\n\nFlash forward to when yours truly started working at *Undisclosed Location*, and the same was true, although we luckily had a more modern intercom system. I always had a fair level of respect for it, because it seemed to work without fail, and was so loud I needed earplugs to protect my hearing from it, let alone the machine noise it was shouting over.\n\nUntil one day when it began having some issues. It started as garbled or distorted sound, then a few days later began cutting out abruptly after the first few syllables spoken. It got so bad that some nights I had to wait by the phone for the front desk to page me, because the intercom was being so difficult to use.\n\nHaving never worked on the intercom before, and only barely been made aware of where it was located, I left a note for the head mechanic, $FM, and he had it fixed the next day. Of course, being a new mechanic who would one day be expected to fix such issues myself, I asked him to walk me through the repair.\n\nHe led me behind the front desk and began to explain how the system worked: there was the microphone mounted to the desk, a series of toggle switches to turn on the intercom speakers in the part of the building you wanted to speak to, and some home stereo looking sound equipment box I wasn't too familiar with, on the bottom shelf under the desk near the floor.\n\nHowever, something seemed out of place to me, namely the big white plastic cap things stuck to the front of the box. They looked suspiciously like the caps that cover the tops of aerosol spray cans, in fact, exactly like the ones from our cans of disinfectant spray that we used on our rental shoes.\n\nIt turns out that $FM realized the desk staff had been accidentally kicking the volume knobs on the intercom box, and had turned the amplifier up so much it was automatically cutting off to avoid blowing out the speakers. All he needed to do to \"fix\" the problem was cover the knobs so they wouldn't be able to move them accidentally again.\n\n**TL:DR:** Users kick things, then complain when they don't work.",

        "text": "Hi all! First time posting to TFTS! Will not be my last, thats for sure! Hope I get the formatting right. :) \n\nFirst off, some back story. I work for a company that does private air charter as well as aviation maintenance. \n\nI was initially hired as a Flight Operations guy, but now serve a dual role as SVRAdmin/IT Support Guy as well as Flight Ops. Company discovered I'm good with computers, now I'm the IT guy! \n\nOn to the story. I'll me $me, $K will be my Boss. He's the Flight Operations Manager, all round good guy and really supportive and $H will be our CFO, an old fossil who really should be enjoying his retirement.\n\nSo yesterday morning I get a call. (I'm technically on holiday, but because I'm the only IT person in the office, it doesnt really mean I'm on holiday) \n\n&gt;$K: $me, the office is panicking, the internet is broken and nobody can get any emails! \n\n&gt;$me: I'd come in and look, but I'm 300km away on holiday. Send me photos of the router and I'll do my best to see if we can sort it, otherwise cry to the Airport's IT Department, they'll help out in a jam\n\nSo I review the images, poor guy doesn't know what a router looks like so I got photos of everything with flashing lights... Switches, PABX, Firewall, the works! Lights on the router show the ADSL line is up, but no internet access. I'm about to call $K back when I get a call from him. This is where it gets good!\n\n&gt;$K: I'm sorry to bother you while you're on holiday but I have to ask you if this might be the problem... We were having our morning meeting when $H mentions he hasn't paid the telephone provider for the last 3 months. \n\n&gt;$me: Well... Umm... If we haven't paid them, they are going to in fact cut our service.\n\n&gt;$K: Oh, yes that does make sense. I'll get on that and have it paid. \n\nSo basically, our ADSL line hasn't been paid for since we had a new phone system installed as we now pay the provider directly for the service instead of the phone company. Finance Department didn't understand we get our internet from the same place and also didn't bother to ask me. So now the company is dead in the water for up to 72 hours until the line is reconnected. \n\nTLDR: CFO didn't pay phone company for line rental. Internet is now cut off for the rest of the week. ",

Problem is, besides either a standalone PC or buying it for everyone, the licenses are *expensive* and unfortunately for $CTO his budget simply won't allow for him to get 8 (at minimum) licenses for but he can get a one PC license (permanent license with no max users defined just 1 workstation).   \n*****   \nLet me explain that everyone I work with is painfully aware I won't pirate software and my departments keeps all other departments' software for them in case they (sigh, *we*) need it FOR them. We have an SOP and everything.      \n  ******\n$CTO receives from me the quotes for all of the options and in an email response I got today (vacationing due to holidays so just now getting back to it), he tells me:\n    \n\n&gt;$CTO: If possible, we would like a Virtual Machine, like that RSSC software (a virtual server for lab monitoring software. which is another old tale of mine and how I got VMWare to begin with) - if you can help us get one, because we can't buy 8 licenses right now and we could all remote to it as needed and use the software from the VM. We don't care if we can't all remote to it at the same time but we can always buy more licenses later.    \n    \n$Me: *Did I read that right?\" I say to myself. I have TONS of space/memory in my host and I am about to add more/another host so I am ecstatic. I emailed him back. \n   \n&gt;$Me: I have the requirements and I will have the VM ready by the end of the week (this week actually). I will need to have you or $RVD step through the install with me so I install it how you need it.    \n     \n&gt;$CTO: Thank you so much! $RDV responds she will be in my office tomorrow to help get the software set up.    \n     \n    \nMaybe I have just really gotten lucky with my users, I know a lot of y'all here on TFTS have some bad ones, but for the most part mine are pretty good. The VM is ready and I am going to be installing the software in the morning. I know I said the end of the week, but \"under promise, over deliver\" - right? I even added it to my Veeam backup.   \n    \nTL/DR: R&amp;D actually asked for a Virtual Machine instead of buying unnecessary hardware to share really expensive software.\n    \nEdit(s): clarity and words (sorry y'all, working on my writing)\n\n    \n\n",

Her coworkers could log into this computer just fine.\n\nMy first instinct was that there was an issue creating a new profile for a new user on this computer.\n\n&gt;User: No, I have worked at this store for over a year now.\n\nWeird. Must be an issue with her AD? Nope, no bad password attempts, no lockouts, no expiration. \n\nI spent a good few minutes scratching my head at her account.\n\n&gt;User: Oh, by the way, one of your techs was working on this computer earlier. So maybe we can just close this ticket and let them finish.\n\nEager as I was to finish this call, my instincts prodded me once again, directing me to check the store's ticket history. Sure enough, there was a recent service done on the computer--but it was already closed.\n\nI checked that ticket, scanning for answers. The original call had determined a full HDD, and the solution was the T2 tech clearing 30 GB of data. \n\nThen why was this computer still having these issues?\n\nMy instincts move my hands of their own accord to type: Win+E C:\\\\Users.\n\nAlas, her profile is nowhere to be seen and my instincts have proven true. L2 actually deleted her profile to free up some space.\n\nI kick that ticket back to L2 and stare blankly into the wall until the phone rings again.\n",

        "text": "Last night was fairly univentful, I watched a film and listened to my phone buzz with some work emails. It was late so I ignored them and promptly got on with an evening of doing very little and battling with insomnia.   \n\nAt about 3am I picked up my phone and saw the 2 emails which now make me yelp in fear.   \n\nUnexpected outage....  \nFuck it. I get in at 8 it will be fine. \nI get to sleep at 4 to get up for 6 and get in for 7:30. I do this so I am in peak support fitness for the day.\nThe office is dark on arrival. 7:30 am. \nWhen I have issues logging into the pc the words unexpected and outage didn't even register. \nLog in as admin. Check to reset my password back, and wonder why I didn't know it. \nNot a major deal I guess.   \nOutage. Fizzes in my hind brain as I open my email to send cat pics to my better half.   \nUnexpected email appears that I start reading.   \nBeyond the obvious spelling mistake it was not a real issue.   \nPassword. Reset. Users.   Random words for my brain to cope with until I started to click what had happened.   \nThe darkness envelops me as I realise that we have 2500 users who now have very limited ability and no clue what their passwords are.   \nThe phones were off. I looked for a place to hide.   \nApparently the exchange which had been turned off had decided to do its 7 day house cleaning the evening before. It had found 2500 orphaned accounts and decided to delete them.   \nOf course this literally wiped out the entire user container.  \nBackup was restored everything was grand apart from the aforementioned passwords.  \n\nPhones still not on. Brain. Connecting the dots and watching the day unfold.  \nA searing pain failed to strike me dead and I cursed and removed the divert.   \nSilence.   \nSilence.   \nI turned and saw one man walking to me, I could hear the words and knew what was coming.    \nThe phone rang.   \n  \nAnd rang. \n\n8 hours later and 500+ support calls for a team of 6 had rendered me a blithering idiot.  \nYes we have a self service password reset. No our users don't know what their mother's maiden name was.  Later this evening I confused my gf telling me she couldn't go out this weekend with her trying to split up with me. \nSo my brain just kicked me in the balls too.  \nMorale of the story. Dont work in IT. \n\n",

He says his computer has viruses and his laptop is absolutely filthy, covered in dust and grime.\n\n\n&gt;The keyboard doesn't work that well unless you press really hard;\n\n\nhe warns me. I'm not surprised; this thing looks like it probably has years of food and grime under the keys. I press REALLY hard to enter the wireless key and get connected to the internet so that I can run the newest version of adwcleaner from a flash drive.\n\n\nAdwcleaner has a little logo that looks like this: https://www.malwarebytes.com/images/adwcleaner/logo.png\n\n\nAdwcleaner keeps running and finding many elements and then small little cockroaches start coming out of the system. Their home must have started heating up, and they wanted out. Ironically, the little cockroaches looked exactly like the bugs from the adwcleaner logo, except brownish-blackish and dime-sized. \n\n\nI hope there's only one or two, and sit down at my desk for a quick game of solitaire while adwcleaner is running. Soon, one of the cockroaches crawls across my monitor... I've had enough. I've got to get him out of the shop so I make up a good excuse.\n\n\n&gt;There is a lot of adware on this system. When this many objects are removed, we run the risk of bricking the operating system. Honestly, with the age of the system, and the fact that the keyboard and DVD drive are broken, it's not worth the price of a fresh reinstallation of Windows;\n\nI tell him. He seems to accept this and is on his way. I vacuumed and sanitized EVERYTHING after that encounter... there were about 10 cockroaches that came out of his system total. \n\ntl;dr user with questionable hygeine brings in filthy laptop, run adwcleaner, adwcleaner-shaped cockroaches start coming out of system.",

        "text": "LTL, FTP. I've done my best to clarify confusing parts of this story and to follow all TFTS rules.\n\nA bit of background: I'm working towards a bachelor's degree in computer science, and hoping to go on to software development. Due to my skill with computers, I'm the tech support for my immediate family...and of course, everyone has my personal cell phone number. :) This particular story just happened a few minutes ago- I'm still on winter break.\n\nI'm spending a quiet night binging /u/Gambatte's EM stories, when suddenly...\n\n*voom voom voom voom voom voom voom*\n\n...my phone vibrates.\n\n&gt; **Dad**: The iPad charger you gave me isn't working. Any idea why it would stop charging?\n\n(Note: I had no memory of giving him this cable, and he didn't push that matter.)\n\nI go downstairs to see what the problem is. First, I apply rule 0 of tech support: is there even a problem? I plug in the iPad; no response. I check all the connections; still no response. Ok, so there is actually a problem.\n\n**iPad adapter + iPad cable + iPad = FAIL**\n\nThe challenge with troubleshooting here is that my dad's iPad was bought brand new...in early 2012. It's one of only two devices still in the house that uses the 30-pin connector, which was retired later in 2012. To see if the cable is bad, I need a known good 30-pin cable- but those aren't easy to find now. So after assuring Dad that I'm troubleshooting and he can go back to football, I go upstairs to get the only other 30-pin cable in the house - the one for my iPod nano 5G - and bring it and my iPod down to the iPad's charging station. First, I plug the suspect cable into the (known good) adapter from my dad's phone and my iPod. Nothing. Okay, so there seems to be a fault in the cable.\n\n**iPhone adapter + iPad cable + iPod = FAIL**\n\nTo confirm this, I swap the iPad's cable for my iPod's cable. As expected, my iPod lights up and charges without issue. Seems like the cable is the problem.\n\n**iPhone adapter + iPod cable + iPod = SUCCESS**\n\n&gt; **Me, thinking**: If it's just the cable that's bad, the iPad should be able to charge with my iPod's cable. That should work for Dad until a new cable is ordered.\n\nOf course, if it was that easy, I wouldn't be telling this story. I plug my iPod's cable into the iPad power adapter (at 5W, an iPhone adapter is too weak for any iPad to detect, so I can't use one in this test) and the iPad. This does not work.\n\n**iPad adapter + iPod cable + iPad = FAIL**\n\nSo the iPad's cable is bad, but that's not the only problem. At this point, I'm stumped. An iPad requires a 12W adapter, but I don't have another 12W adapter to troubleshoot with- let alone a known good one. All I can say is that either the adapter or the iPad's charging port is bad. Until I have a brainwave and do a quick Google search. Turns out that any iDevice can use a iPad adapter. Having never owned an iPad myself, I never knew that, and I was worried that the higher power might damage the smaller devices that use the 5W adapter. So now, I try the iPad adapter with my iPod and its cable. It works.\n\n**iPad adapter + iPod cable + iPod = SUCCESS**\n\nNow remember, I already tried charging the iPad by just swapping in my iPod's cable. That didn't work. But since the iPad's adapter did charge my iPod, I know that it must be working properly. That means that the malfunction, as far as I can tell, must be in the iPad. The wall outlet works, the power adapter works, the charging cable works, but the iPad is not getting power. It seems like the problem can't be in anything but the iPad's charging port.\n\n&gt; **Me**: *goes over to my dad* I've got bad news, and I've got worse news. The bad news is that your cable is bad. The worse news is that your iPad's charging port is also bad. *briefly explains how I came to my conclusion*\n\n&gt; **Dad**: Alright, thanks. I'll work on it. **(Translation: It's not an urgent matter to me, and I don't want to spend time on it now, so I'll figure out what to do later.)**\n\nTotal time elapsed: 15-20 minutes.\n\nTL;DR Dad's iPad won't charge. He's right that the cable has gone bad, but his iPad's also got a problem.\n\n**UPDATE**: Dad took the iPad into an Apple store for repair, literally got laughed at when they saw how old the iPad was, and ended up getting a newer iPad. (I don't know the exact model, but it has a Lightning port.) The employees were very helpful in getting all of his data transferred to the new iPad.",
