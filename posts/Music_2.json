The music video is a dope mashup of 80's that feels so right for the vibe!   \n\n\nAnd even fans of sophisticated 80's such as #ScrittiPoliti would probably quite like this as well as more contemporary electronica such as #fourtet and #caribou.

        "text": "Folks, especially the ones buying mostly Vinyl: I‘m a huge fan of Killing Joke, had exactly 17 albums &amp; compilations by them on CD. I sold them 2 years ago thinking: „You will collect them again as LP‘s“. Now I am still sitting here -for various reasons- without any physical KJ-Release, feeling like a stupid idiot. So… if music is your number 1 passion and you need money: Think what else you can sell to make a quick buck. You will miss the media you sold. And lesson 2 I learned: CD or Vinyl doesn’t make a huge difference at all. I was silly and a victim to the vinyl-hipster-virus by thinking so. How I‘d love to have those Remasters with Bonus Tracks back…\nCheers to this glorious Sub!",

        "text": "About 2-3 weeks ago, someone posted the video for Feuer frei by Rammstein. I'd heard of them several years ago but never listened to anything by them. I'm not sure why, I just never did. My favorite band since I was 13 in 1980 has always been Rush but I do like bands like Queensryche, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and metal in general so its not like I don't listen to rock or metal. Anyway, when I saw the video posted, I figured I'd give it a listen. It must have been perfect timing because I was really blown away by the music, the performance, and the stage presence of the musicians. I think I watched that video 8-10 times in a row just taking it all in and really enjoying the music. I listened to the rest of the album and really got into it. I work from home so now when I start my workday, the first thing I do is say \"Alexa, shuffle songs by Rammstein\" and I have them playing  in the background. \n\nSo, to whoever posted that video, thank you for helping me discover Rammstein!",

Once tickets went on sale it had to occur through a verified account and that account holder will need to be present at the show to gain entry. Transfers of tickets were not allowed, and if you were unable to go to the show, you would have to relist at the same price you paid on Ticketmaster.\n\nIf came to news today that Ticketmaster charged more than expected service fees, which caused him to have another meet with them, and is now refunding $5-$10 based on the tickets you've purchased.\n\nI think it's an eye opener to see that artists do in fact have control over Ticketmaster, and a lot of artists that are \"doing everything in their power\" clearly don't care.\n\nAt the end of the day, if artists really wanted to do something, they would, and Robert Smith and The Cure proved that tonight.\n\nWhat's your thoughts r/music ?

Intonation was great, feel was great! I was surprised because of how old the guitar was and how it hadn’t been played in years!\n\nSomething unexpected happened to our band during the show. While we were playing in the casino bar, the ballroom had been transformed into an auditorium where The Guess Who was performing for a sold-out audience. Little did we know that our wireless frequencies were getting crossed and that our guitar and bass sounds were coming through their amplifiers in the other room! After our first song, one of their technical crew members came running in through our backstage door to alert us of the mix-up. We quickly adjusted our equipment and continued with the show. Later that night, as The Guess Who's concert let out, a large number of new audience members came over to dance and sing along with our band, making for an incredible and unforgettable experience. \n\n\n[I accidentally played with The Guess Who at Riverside Casino](https://youtu.be/Jy2XE0fCz2w)",

        "text": "Two things this week have brought this subject to my mind.  First: yesterday, Jim Gordon died.  He was an amazing drummer and one of the most gifted musicians of his generation.  He played on countless hits and wrote the piano coda from \"Layla\".   His brilliant and intuitive drumming made him an \" in demand\" studio player for his career.   He was also an undiagnosed schizophrenic who ended up murdering his mother and spending the rest of his life in a mental hospital never regaining any semblance of sanity.   \n\n\nSecond: I commented on a picture of Elvis Presley from 1969 that was posted.  I replied how I thought it was the King at the height of his powers.  He was singing again and had stopped doing cheesy movies and still looked amazing.  But...many people had comments about him being a pedophile and a drug addict.  All of which is true.  He did court Prescilla when she was a teen and he was an adult. Also, he was a speed freak who was high most of the time when that picture was taken.  \n\n\nSo, that has me thinking about separating the art from the artist.  It's a complicated thing, I think.  On one hand, someone can be difficult to work with, be an asshole to others or be boorish and still maintain their reputation.  I think of Frank Zappa in this regard.   His music could be sexist, baudy and sleazy to a point and he could be a jerk to a lot of people he didn't like.  But, his standing as a  composer and musician is not in question.  He is still considered one of the most brilliant American composers of the 20th century.  John Lennon was an abusive alcoholic who was violent in his early years and even hit his girlfriends.  Even though it is brought up sometimes, his reputation has never really suffered.  Even though Chris Brown is a pariah (deservedly so in my opinion) to many who committed a heinous violent assault on Rhianna , he still gets work.  Still is famous with followers and fans.  Then there are things like the song \"Rock n Roll part II\".  It's still used as an anthem at sports events all over the world even though Gary Glitter was a pedophile.  These are just a couple of examples off the top of my head.   \n\n\nSo, how do we separate the art from the artist?  When  do we say this person should be scrubbed from our consciousness because of the things they did?  How do we make the distinction?  We are all human and we all do stupid things.  Musicians or other artists are not infallible.  Some of them are horrible people IRL.  Some of them have done awful things to others and we look the other way.  Some of them do things that are considered bad, but redeem themselves.   Jim Gordon was a violent drug abuser who committed murder, yet he was severely mentally impaired in an industry that was not equipped to either recognize or help him.  Do we stop listening to his massive body of work because of who he was?  Do we ignore it?  I don't know the answer.  I still love listening to Elvis, The Beatles, and \"Layla and Other assorted Love songs\" is my favorite album of all time.  Hell, Eric Clapton is an asshole and I still listen to his music despite knowing of his personal faults.  So, where do we draw the line?  What is acceptable or not?   I'd love to hear what others think because I do not think there is a simple or black/white answer to this problem.",
