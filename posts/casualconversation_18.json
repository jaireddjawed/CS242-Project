Nothing would settle her down. We took her outside, made sure she had water, gave her the chance to switch rooms. Nothing helped. She had always slept in bed with us so when she started her crying routine. We took her to the vet. She had dementia. Her symptoms are sundowning. Apparently dementia symptoms and confusion get worse at night. She got meds but the vet said she'll just get worse ac we'll just have to readjust the meds when that happens. \n\nWe have been pretty patient with her. She wakes us up every other night. Sometimes firm directions like telling her to lay down helps her with the confusion, some times it doesnt. She also started clawing at our faces when she wakes us up. She doesn't mean to hurt us. She has shown no aggression what so ever. I think she is just desperate for us to help her when she gets confused. I have scars on my arms from it. Normally i just push her, gently, off of me and wait for her to calm down. Sometimes she gets my neck.\n\nOver the last month i spent 3 weeks dog sitting 7 dogs for family. I haven't got much sleep in that time because i was watching 5 dogs and 2 dogs at a time. 2 nights ago my dog with dementia started having a bad night. She clawed at me and cried. Normally her worst episodes last for and hour and a half. She woke me up at 12 am then went back to sleep, I went to bed at 11pm. Then she woke me up at 4am. Except she isn't having a normal episode, it never ended. I work from home she kept trying to claw at me while i worked. So i locked her out of my office. She finally quit after 8 hours of non stop crying and clawing st me. \n\nThat night i took her for a walk so she could sleep through the night and i could sleep. She woke me up at 2am by clawing at my eyes. I was so enraged and sleep deprived that I almost punched her. Im not exaggerating i wanted to just throw her off the bed or smack her. Instead i picked her up and locked her out of my room. She proceeded to bang in the door and cry until i got up for work again. She has an appointment to adjust her meds next week. I love her so much but i genuinely wanted to hurt her and it scared me.",

Here are some suggestions:\n\nIncrease your water intake: Drinking more water can help flush toxins out of your body.\n\nEat whole, unprocessed foods: Focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods such as fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. Avoid processed and sugary foods.\n\nReduce or eliminate caffeine and alcohol: Both caffeine and alcohol can be hard on the liver, which plays a key role in detoxification.\n\nExercise regularly: Exercise helps to boost circulation, which can aid in the detoxification process.\n\nGet enough sleep: Sleep is important for your body to repair and regenerate, which can help with detoxification.\n\nTry a juice cleanse: A juice cleanse involves drinking only fruit and vegetable juices for a period of time, typically 1-3 days. This can help to flush out toxins from your body.\n\nTake Epsom salt baths: Epsom salt contains magnesium, which can help to relax muscles and reduce inflammation.\n\nUse a dry brush: Dry brushing is a technique where you use a dry brush to exfoliate your skin. This can help to stimulate your lymphatic system, which plays a key role in detoxification.\n\nRemember to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any detox program, especially if you have any underlying health conditions.",

        "text": "I just finished a movie called \"Ruby Sparks\". I wanted to share it with somebody. Then I realized I don't have anyone to share. It's not like I don't leave the house struggling severe depression. I do know people but there's just one or two person I can call friend. Most if the time I am okay with it. I'm an introvert. I like solidarity to some level. Being in crowd and dealing with people exhaust me. But I also like sharing things that I find funny, informative, usefull or silly. I don't talk to much but when I'm with my friend I don't shut up. It's like I'm always in power saving mode other then those short times I'm with someone I'm comfortable to be and to talk with. Someone that accepts me the way I am. Someone I can be myself near him. And I don't have many of them. And it sucks. Sometimes this thing we call life and loneliness and everything is too much. I've already lost my hope on so many things. I almost have no expectations therefore no disappointmens. It's ok generally but sometimes some things triggers some things and Voil√†! \n\nAnyways. The movie.\n\n I like rom-com movies generally. When I first saw this movie I don't know where.. actually I think I watched Zoe Kazan movie and I wanted to watch more of her work. I think it was The Big Sick which was also a cute movie. Anyways. The trailer was interesting, story pulled me in other than Zoe. I was expecting it to be cute but it turned out amazing. I loved it so much. Especially story was great. Scenes near the ending was shocking to me. I don't want to spoil anything if anyone care to watch after this post but you'll know which scenes I'm talking about. Zoe's acting was so great. The fact that she was the writer of the movie was a huge plus for me. \n\nAnyways. Thanks for reading :/ I hope it was not a waste of time for you.",

I'm not financially stable and have a lot of health problems, but I WILL go. I will get there.

I was staying at my grandma's house on a really cold and windy day and we had to go buy some meat. \n\nMy grandma didn't want us to go outside without something to keep our heads warm and protected from the wind, but we didn‚Äôt have any hats or hoodies at our disposal at that time. (My grandma has never been a fan of wearing hats or covering her head in general.)\n\nSo both of us ended up going to the supermarket with bulky woolen scarves wrapped around our heads. We went to get some meat at the supermarket's butcher section and the woman selling the meat saw us buying some pork and she said to my grandma:\n\n\"Are you sure you want to buy this, ma'am? It's pork.\" \n\nMy grandma casually replied saying she already knew it was pork and she wanted to buy it. \n\nThe woman sold us the pork and didn‚Äôt say anything but she kept looking at us in a surprised way. \n\nWe didn't realise what had happened until we came back home and took off our scarves and we both laughed and continue to laugh at it to this day! \n\nHas a similar experienced happened to you before? For what were you mistaken as? What was your reaction and the one of the people that mistook you for said thing? Please feel free to share your experience!",

I saw that she was getting the lady settled in first class. A few minutes later, another gentleman from first class was dragging his bag aft. As he passed me, in a low voice he called me an A\\*\\*H\\*\\*\\*. I looked surprised, and he said, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt let you be the only one‚Äù. Mid flight the first cabin flight attendant brought us both drinks and a snack. She thought what we did was great and she said the people we had given ours seats were really enjoying the experience and kindness, almost as much as she was.",

My heart sank to the floor because I couldn't figure it out what could be casuing it, so since I did everything right I thought the Mobo could be broken and there was no one to help me but I only had to update the BIOS and even though it was a pain in the ass to do it everything went well. \n\nSince that experience left me tired as fuck I decided to continue today. I booted it up, installed windows but I noticed that the PC only detected one of the two RAM sticks, so after trying all that I could to make them work it still detected only one, and the feeling I had was something that I could only describe with [this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/002/258/832/235.jpg) . After I started panicking because this meant either send the mobo or the Ram back to get a new one, It turns out that I wasn't fully pressing the sticks in the slots, because I knew that I had to apply force to install them but I was afraid of breaking them, but I can finally breath a sigh of relief knowing everything is ok\n\nBuilding PC for myself is something that I wanted to do but I hope that I don't have to do again in areally long time",

I don't have ~~much~~ any past spa experience, but I think I'm in a mode where it might be just what I need. I'd also be willing to check out something yoga-oriented, or even a silent retreat. I'd generally like something calm, somewhere beautiful.\n\nThis idea is in its infancy, but I'd like to move on it before my motivation wanes. \n\nCan anyone make a recommendation? Or share a story of your own restorative solo trip? Or recommend a book to bring with me on said trip? If you're a spa person, what services would you recommend to a newbie who's not sure if it is her thing?",

        "text": "So for some info, i'm a uni student and currently live in a dorm, for some time now i noticed one of my roommates would randomly start crying, most of the time is when we go to sleep witch isn't so bad cuz i can just ignore them and pretend it doesn't happend, but one time they kinda started tearing up beside me while i was on my computer and i had no idea what to do. I always hated crying and still do, i just can't understand how someone would not be ashamed to do that in front of others, don't get me wrong i get that people should not bottle up emotions and what not, but i can't help find it extremely unconfortable. My opinion aside, what would be a normal way of handeling that sort of situation so i don't become super awkward and do or say stupid stuff?",

A body has been found!\"\n\nAnd for the next five minutes all the kids started accusing each other of being the impostor saying things like:\n\n\"Lizzy vented!\"\n\n\"No, Lizzy was with me doing tasks!\"\n\n\"I saw John at electrical!\"\n\n\"No, you're lying!\"\n\nExcept everyone was making everything up because they weren't playing the actual video game! They were iust yelling at each other while sitting on the bus and I was laughing so hard! Heck, they even accused a child of being the impostor for no reason, and that child defended himself saying he was dead and that he had been killed by the kid that had accused him! And remember...all of this was imaginary, none of them was playing the actual video game!",

It just feels like people get infected in really stupid ways when some sort of armor coild have prevented that. But specifically chainmail seems useful. I feel like if something happened it would definitley be in style",

So I developed this bad habit of changing numbers in frequent intervals, mostly when I got new phones and it became a habit, I just didn't like the feeling that people who have disrespected me, made me feel expendable can just enter my future in any way and just hit me up one day like nothing happened.",
