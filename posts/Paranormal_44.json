The other day my daughter was laying in my bed, I had just gotten out of the shower and she stated to me \"I was just laying here reading and I heard...\"Psst Psst\"\" So of course I asked her if it could have possibly been the TV or maybe something my mother could have been doing in the kitchen, but she said no...So i was sitting there combing my hair and we BOTH hear...\"Psst Psst\". We have heard this multiple times on different days. Needless to say, I hate being there alone, both of my daughters have experienced paranormal activity there, from doorknobs turning and the door slowly opening and there being no one on the other side of that door, to feelings of being surrounded by and watched by unseen eyes to the point where you freeze and cannot move. Any thoughts?",

        "text": " I will begin this story with a quick note about the home I grew up in. The home was an old mill home that was moved from one location to where it stands now and a basement was dug during the construction by my family.\n\nThe home looks like your normal home unless you really look at it. There is a window above the garage that always seemed to give me an eerie feeling, like someone was watching me from there. Now, I’ve never seen anyone standing there however, you can’t rid yourself of that uneasy feeling. \n\nGrowing up, I had multiple paranormal occurrences. My father raised me and my sister in that home, so she and I had spent plenty of time alone. When I was a younger child, I never slept without a light, tv, or radio on. I needed noise, light, to distract me from feeling uneasy, watched. \n\nI do not know any other history of my home, except that it was moved. I feel whatever is in that house, is unhappy about that fact. The house almost feels…cursed in a way. I do not have the same nostalgic sense that people get from seeing or visiting their childhood home. Even today when I visit I feel uncomfortable. \n\nOne day, I was left alone in my preteen years. I was a fairly responsible kid and I was just playing on the computer while my father was out running some errands. I heard a voice coming through the speakers, which was impossible as the computer was not hooked to internet nor was I playing a game that had voices as I was playing solitaire on windows. Next, I heard heavy, loud footsteps coming from the hallway towards the room I was in. They sounded a lot like the cowboy boots that my dad always wore. “Hello? Dad?”. No answer. I wasn’t freaked out until I peeked out the room and saw no one. I ran outside and the truck was not there. I instantly picked up the house phone to call my dad and when hitting the green call button, the phone made a loud screeching sound. I dropped the phone where I stood without hanging up, and ran outside until my dad showed up about 30 minutes later. Of course I tried to tell him what happened and he replied “oh, you probably just picked up a semi drivers radio on the computer and you’re just hearing things.” I couldn’t believe he thought that I was making this up.\n\nOver the years I didn’t have many problems with the home until I was alone again in my bedroom, studying on my bed, my cat Spock, sitting with me on my book. After a an hour or so, he suddenly got up and fluffed up, fur standing on edge, staring towards my open closet. He hissed and spat at what seemed like nothing. The room got cold and I of course got up to see what he could be so frightened of. Nothing was there, nor did I hear anything. That was until I heard whispering outside of my bedroom door. I quickly swung it open and again, nothing was there. I wrote it off as the heater making noise and went to bed, or tried. I laid down, lamp still on, when all of the sudden my radio turned itself on. This was an old radio without a remote so there was no way it could turn on without hitting the button. I didn’t sleep that night. \n\nMy story picks back up when I was 18. I lived alone in the house as my father had picked up a job in another state. I had a friend over for the night and after our movie marathon we tried to go to bed. As we sat there in the quiet dark, he said “Do you hear that?” “Hear what?” I asked. “Those voices, there are people talking.” “What?” “Shhh!” He silenced me. As we sat in the darkness you could hear two people whispering to each other outside my bedroom. I got up to investigate, and there was no one there. “Screw this.” He said. I picked up my cell phone to call my dad and instead of the phone ringing I got a message saying that number wasn’t in service. “Impossible.” I said. We ran outside and I drove to a church parking lot. I dialed my dad again and it went through but he didn’t answer. I called my best friend to ask if we could sleep at her house for the night and she agreed. That friend spent many nights at my house as a child and she also felt the unease in my home and understood. \n\nMy last paranormal experience happened when I moved back into my parents home after a failed relationship many years later in 2017. I was taking a nap on the couch while my dad was out and I was woken up by someone whispering in my ear “Hey!!” I swung up off the couch and grabbed my cell phone. When I tried to call my dad it did the same exact screeching sound that the home phone did all those years ago. Again, I sat outside crying waiting on him to get home. He still didn’t believe what I had experienced and to this day still writes it off.",

It was just floating there but part of seemed to be reaching toward me until I woke up. Then it seemed to freeze in place but was still undulating. I screamed twice then turned over, said “nope” and went back to sleep. I’ve had lots of experiences with human spirits but I’ve never seen something’s visual form or felt something so evil. I’ve tried looking for what it might have been online but can’t find anything. Has anyone ever seen something similar or know what this could be? Thankfully I haven’t seen anything similar since.",

In a way it perplexes me, in one hand I don't think I'm special and think this is all just a very long list of strange coincidences but the amount of times I was right about events makes it hard for me to accept that, this is my first time coming online and speaking about this, \nA couple of instances that are the most unique just to put a reference on how this is operating, \nOne day I was driving with my family we were going down an old wooded area during the winter it was snowing enough to easily make you lose traction of your car if you weren't careful, that's when it happened I got that same feeling of strangeness, my gut was telling me something bad is going to happen and I was verbal about it to my family, and my oldest sibling who was driving slowed down to a more safe driving speed well as we drive down this wooded area we come across a fresh crash site, a car went into a tree the crash looked rough but the people were okay, and that's just one instance of my 'gut' telling me, \nWhat's been worrying me extremely as of late is this feeling, this prediction feeling I have in my gut, it keeps telling me that sometime this year, and next year I will die, I can't think of a future where I'm alive and my 'gut' feeling is telling me something bad will happen to me within this next year or so that'll end my life. \nI suppose this could have a logical answer, but with how many times this strange prediction ability I have was right, I'm now starting to think my life is on a timer\nI guess I'll find out in the coming year",

        "text": "This is the third time this has happened and I am baffled. I have string lights on the back of my living room TV which are plugged into the TV with a USB cord. There is a remote for the lights but I usually only use it to change to color as the lights come on when I turn on the TV and turn themselves off a few minutes after I turn the TV off. Most every night, I do turn the lights off using the remote right after I turn the TV off just to be sure that they are off. \n\nA couple of months ago, I woke up in the middle of the night and they were on. Not the TV, just the lights. I just thought it was strange and turned them off, went back to bed. The next morning I tried everything to turn them on without the TV being on but to no avail. At that point, I was very confused but just thought it was some glitch. \n\nA couple of weeks later, one of my aunts passed away. That night, same thing happened accept this time, it woke me up. I laid in bed, half asleep and kind of annoyed as I have a great deal of trouble sleeping through the night anyway so I just said, “Ok. Now turn them off.” And I’ll be damned if they didn’t turn off. Neither time did I actually feel afraid or off in any way, just perplexed and intrigued. \n\nIt happened again last night when I got up to go to the bathroom. Again, I sat here this morning trying to turn the lights on while the TV was off and I could not do it. What could be causing this? The fact that I don’t become afraid by it makes me think there is a logical explanation. I must note, I live alone and have no animals. Also, I look at the clock each time out of curiosity as well and this always happens between 3-4am. Any ideas on what could cause this?",

We got there and were brought to the first room with the whole group and the tour guide talked about how there was a spirit of a little girl in there that loved to touch people on the shoulders to mess with them and thought it was funny. So then I feel a tap on my shoulder and I turn around and it’s just my dad and we share a laugh and talk about how creepy that would be. \n \nLater after several more terrifying rooms and story’s we make it to the basement where the Joker lives who is the worst of all of the ghosts that apparently live there and even when it was still an asylum they wouldn’t let anyone go downstairs later In the afternoon and night. So of course I’m a little creeped out but I’m was like 9 so of course ghosts aren’t real. But then I feel a tap on my shoulder, this was definitely a tap and nothing fell and hit my shoulder and there was no breeze or anything, and my dad is 20 feet away standing in the back of the room talking to someone not paying attention. Behind me there was one dude who was not agile enough to run to me and back and no one else was close enough to me. Now I’m terrified and I went and told my dad about it but he’s busy talking to someone else so he’s busy.\n\nSo now from this and a few other experiences I now believe on some form of afterlife or something.",

        "text": "When I was very young, my Auntie had a stillborn baby boy. I was so young at the time that I don’t really remember it, but the emotional fallout for the whole family was huge, so huge that every year on his birthday, the whole family would meet up to celebrate him. We would always get together for a few days, staying over at my Grandma’s house, and then on his birthday, we would have a barbecue and let balloons up into the sky.\n\nThis experience happened on one of these trips. I was around 7, and my little brother was 3. It was the day of what would have been the baby’s 5th birthday, and my parents had left me and my brother to stay with my Grandma, and were coming to collect us at of the barbecue. It was the height of summer, around 3pm, and my brother and I were playing around the house until I got bored and went to talk to my Grandma. \n\nMy Grandma and I were chatting in the lounge, and after a while, it was time to set off for the barbecue. I started donning my coat and shoes, and my Grandma was calling up the stairs for my brother to come down. No response. She started getting anxious, and called again. Still no response. \n\nShe went upstairs to see where he was. She checked the bedroom where we were playing. Nothing. She checked the bathroom and other bedrooms. Nothing. At this point, panic really ensued. He hadn’t come downstairs into the lounge. Had he fallen from a second story window? Had he run out of the front door and into the street? Both me and my Grandma were frantically searching the silent house for any signs of my brother, checking the garden, the bathrooms, bedrooms, everywhere. He was just gone. \n\nMy Grandma was screaming his name, and went up into the bedroom for one last check. She threw open the wardrobe and my brother was there, curled up amongst the clothes and shoes at the bottom of the wardrobe, silent. \n\nMy Grandma let out a huge sigh of relief, pulled him from the wardrobe and into a tight hug. “I was shouting you,” she said shakily. “We didn’t know where you were. We were worried.”\n\nMy brother looked up at her with round eyes, and said quietly: “I was playing hide and seek.”\n\nMy Grandma frowned at him, and explained patiently: “We didn’t know we were playing hide and seek. You mustn’t hide without telling us that we’re playing. \n\nMy brother stared at her blankly for a moment, and then frowned. “I wasn’t playing with you,” he said indignantly. \n\nMy Grandma frowned. “What do you mean? Who were you playing with?”\n\n“I was playing with the little boy.”\n\nMy Grandma pressed a little. Who was this boy? Where was he now? How old was he, what did he look like? My brother described this child as a bit bigger than him but not as old as me. He said he had blond hair (like my auntie) and very pale skin. He wasn’t here now, and my brother wasn’t sure where he had gone. He’d just agreed to play the game of hide and seek, so maybe he was hiding, too. \n\nThe mad thing was, other than my brother, the stillborn baby was the only boy in the family. The age and description my brother gave was eerily similar to how the boy would have looked if he were still alive. And maybe even spookier than that - my brother didn’t really know who the baby was. Sure, he knew we were celebrating a baby’s birthday, but he was only young and he definitely didn’t understand in depth who the baby was or how old he would have been. My Grandma was baffled, creeped out, and had no explanation for it. \n\nShe brushed it off, and told my brother to come and get his coat and shoes on. She took his hand and headed towards the door. My brother hesitated, looked up at her, and said: “Grandma?”\n\nMy Grandma looked down at him. “Yes?”\n\nHe looked visibly worried. “Don’t leave me up here again. I don’t like that little boy.”\n\nEven more taken aback, my Grandma pressed him as to why not, but my brother wouldn’t say another word about him. Whatever questions she asked were met with silence.\n\nTo this day, my Grandma is convinced that my brother was playing hide and seek with a ghost. My brother doesn’t remember it at all, and barely even remembers the barbecues and balloon celebrations we used to do. I’m not sure what I believe, but thinking back to that day still gives me chills. I think something about how worried my brother looked, and how creepily accurate all of his responses were, are pretty hard to explain. There were no little boys living on my grandma’s street or in my family. There is no explanation for a young boy being in the house that day. I guess you could explain it away saying that kids have overactive imaginations, but my brother never had imaginary friends before or after that. All these years later, we’re still dumbfounded.",

I do believe that there are beings beyond our understanding, perhaps on a different plane of existence that we can barely comprehend. \n\nNonetheless, I'm not sure what to explain this as, but I'm not comfortable enough to sleep despite being tired. \n\nI woke up to my cat trying to go out my window. Thats no problem, I let her out and she leaves, and I have to use the bathroom. So I do, and when I come back, im just chilling in bed looking at my wall. My room used to be the dining room and has two massive windows in it that I cover with a shower curtain design. I just closed it because my cat went out and I dont like any light in my room at night, so I made sure there was none. \n\nWhen I was laying down i noticed a relatively big patch of neon green light in my room. At first it confused me because I thought it was one of the glow in the dark stars I have all over my room. Except its been dark for hours and the stars in my room arent even glowing anymore. The problem is that it was bigger than the biggest star shape i had, and it wasnt in the shape of a star. It sat on my wall on under the corner of a poster.\nThis wouldnt be a problem if not for the fact that it literally should not be possible. I turned my light on and it disappeared off the wall, and I walked over to touch the spot and even move the corner of the picture just to see. There was nothing there. \n\nI have a nightmare condition that gives me many bad dreams but ive never been the kind of person to hallucinate or just... See things like that. I hear things sometimes, I see things when I'm paranoid. But i wasnt paranoid at all when I saw this. \n\nMy vision is bad and I wear contacts but even then it shouldnt change the fact that what I saw was a random patch of glowing green light the same color as the stars. I spent so much time googling it and looking into it but there was no answer. It seems a few people have experienced random green light before, but not how im describing it. People see it as a dot on the wall that shouldnt be there. Or the light moves. \n\nFor me, the light didnt move. I didnt bother to stare for too long as i quickly became freaked tf out and had to turn on my light. I dont understand, i dont know why this happened, but I hate it a lot and want an explanation. Serious replies only please. I dont want to hear about a \"ghost\" that probably isn't there.",

Another example was me counting out exactly 26 cookies in the cookie jar. When I went to check again there was 23 (I live alone so it wasn't another person).  In another instance I got up thinking I need to take out the trash getting up to do it only to find it had already been taken out.  A game save reverting to a slightly earlier state.\n\nIn short they are all minor things that alone could be brushed off alone. However the frequency of them occurring has gotten so bad lately it's become impossible for me not to notice. \n\nAny thoughts?",

During the Japanese invasion, bodies were buried beneath our school floors. Already, chills are sent down my spines writing this. It was around 1pm after lunch break, I wanted to collect my books from my locker which is situated at the highest floor of our school. Before entering, you will see the statue of Mary glaring at you, scruntinizing your every move. It was already frightening to see her haunting face but the location itself was already isolating. When you reach, one side of the hallway is filled lockers and the other is a storeroom. In front of you is a science lab. \n\nAnyways, I went to the further end of the hallway to collect my books. As I was walking, I felt dread weighing over shoulders. I felt that something was amiss. I ignored my instincts which will later cost me eventually. I sat on the floor, taking my sweet time removing books from the locker, I heard footsteps made from a heel within the science lab. The sound was extremely loud as the floors were made of wood. I paused and really tried to focus on the sudden noises. It grew louder with each passing minute before coming to a halt.   I peered into the classrooms and the lab but nobody was there.\n\nThe sky grew gloomy. I stood there, waiting for someone to appear but after minutes of waiting, there was no sign of teachers. In fear, I paced towards the exit. After a few steps,  I heard voices of children laughing and running around right behind me. This was odd, since children should not even be here as it was a secondary school. The noise wasnt even from the outside since it was a Monday and there arent any physical activity on the first day of school. I sped up my walk. Suddenly, all the lockers, in unison were making loud and brash noices from the inside..THE INSIDE. I jumped 10 steps, almost broke an ankle and ran back to my classroom. I cried in front of everyone. Everyone thought I was hysterical.\n\nI never went back up again. I told my classmates to bring my books from upstair. In my final year, no joke, my locker was situated on the lower level as well but different building.",

This backroom that connects to where we were had the lights off and was pretty dark. I thought I saw something move, but brushed it off to a flickering light, and never mentioned it to my friend. They were cleaning and talking to me while this happened, and almost immediately after, stopped in their tracks and said they think they saw something back there. I admit I just saw something too and instantly get the chills.\n\nI could feel a presense and then they tell me they think it is haunted and that last night they had headphones in cleaning and a man screamed in their ear. I went to the dark room and pretended like someone was pulling me away. I go back to where we were and I felt like something was behind me and they said the ceiling fan was moving. I look up and it is spinning slow and comes to a stop. The other two never moved and all the windows/doors are shut, so there would be no draft. No AC on. \n\nI had chills the whole way home and did not want to look in my rear view mirror lol. I hope I didn't piss it off when I was joking around. Next time I am there I am having my phone recording the whole time. I got chills just typing about this. I'm trying to look up info on the building to see if anything happened there.",

        "text": "I suppose I should start from the beginning. It started earlier this year when my first dog died his name was Peewee and I had, had him since he was a puppy. Suddenly and seemingly without warning his health went bad overnight and he died. About 6 months later my other dog died under similar  circumstances. However after I finished burying her I saw a tall black outline of a man standing on my back porch. He was only there for a second and then disappeared. I looked up what the hatman was and then tried to place hamsa hands on all of my doorways and everywhere else in the house. From what I read online these are suppose to ward off evil. I thought perhaps I was just being paranoid and seeing things but was trying to air on the side of caution regardless. However several days ago while I was passing through the kitchen I looked outside and saw him standing there. It was again only for the briefest second and then he was gone. My third dog which I call Loly lives inside but spent much of her time outside during the day. Today around noon I noticed she was lethargic so I took her into the house and put her in the bed. \n\nI tried to get her into the vet but they didn't have room for an appointment until in the morning. However when I went to check on Loly a few hours ago she had passed away in her bed. The third perfectly healthy dog dropping dead within a year. Combined with two hat man sightings. Maybe it's my imagination but I think whatever this thing is it's bringing me bad karma. Or am I just imagining things?\n\nAnyone have an opinion?",

        "text": "Hey everyone. I posted on here about a year ago, under the same title as now. To sum that post up: for a few months I had the same dream every night of standing in a white circle of light, in and infinite, fog-like blackness with an entity. It was a black figure in the shape of a human. It had no facial features, or any features really. It was just blackness in the shape of a human. One night in particular I ended up \"releasing\" it and I started seeing it in real life, out of the corner of my eyes, on the street and stuff like that. If you'd like more background, please check out the original post, it's on my profile. Under that post, someone told me to update my situation weekly. I didn't do that, but I think I should have. Here's my situation now.\n\nI still see him, while I'm awake sometimes, but not as much as I used to. I also started referring to him as Azazel but I don't know why. I just started calling him that once and it felt right, so I kept doing it. I'm not back to the same dream, almost every night. I stand in the circle of light, with him moving around the edge of it, talking to me. I really remember what we talk about, and even when I do, I just don't understand it. I tried writing words I remember down, but I never managed to do it. Sometimes we are not in that blackness, but someplace else  like a city or a forest. I've never seen the places he takes me before. I'm honestly starting to warm up to him, but that is one of the reasons I felt like I have to write here again. He's starting to feel like a friend and I don't know if that's a good thing. I'm less frightened and more well rested when I wake up from these dreams then before tho, so that's at least good. But I'm honestly worried of where this whole thing is going. \n\nI'm once again sorry if my description of anything wasn't clear, if I can clear up anything, just ask. I really do need help as to what is happening to me.",

It's my time of solice and when I watch all the movies and TV that I don't watch when my kids are awake. Last night was just like any other, calm and quiet. Our house is very open, with the couch up against a half-wall where you can see right into the kitchen. Anyway, around 3 this morning, I'm sitting there, scrolling through my phone and watching a movie. Out of nowhere, it sounds like all hell breaks loose in the kitchen behind me. Like stuff being violently shoved around. I remember hearing myself yell \"WHAT the HELL?!\" and already being up on my feet without even thinking about it. As soon as I jumped up, it stopped. I fully expected to catch a glimpse of something there, and stuff all over the place. Nothing was out of place and nothing had fallen or toppled over. I hoped to see my cat being the culprit, but she was back in our room. It took me 10 minutes to start calming down and getting my heartbeat back under control. The adrenaline made everything feel fuzzy. I will note that my FIL passed away yesterday morning, but I wouldn't imagine him to be the type to drive fear into anyone. He wasn't like that at all. I don't know what did it or why.",

When we walked in we were greeted by an older lady, a little chubby, who seemed to be wearing an all white dress now that I look back. She was standing, or maybe sitting, behind a podium or desk, whichever it was. Me and my mother both remember seeing her and talking with her. She asked us if we knew where we were going, we said yes, and then headed up the stairs toward the dental office door. The next time we went in, there was no lady, and no desk or podium there. While we were making small talk with the front desk of the office, we mentioned the receptionist/front desk downstairs and had a question about them. They told us there's never been anyone in the lobby or any front desk receptionist. It was like she disappeared with no trace. Me and my mother are both convinced she was a ghost.",

I finished, put it all away like usual, watched TV for maybe 30 minutes before I got up to get a snack. When I came back, there was a remote in the middle of my living room floor.\n\nI was immediately taken aback because I had never seen a remote like that before, and I had *just* been literally laying down on the floor where it was, and it wasn’t there. Not to mention I had been watching TV in the room, too, so it’s not like it fell from somewhere or I would have seen it. I took a picture of it and sent it to my husband, wondering if it was a lost remote to something of his but he had never seen it before either. It could turn on and had this blinking green light, so I broken it open, removed the batteries (which had writing in another language on it), and wrote the whole thing off as really weird. \n\nThen today, same sort of thing. Came out in my living room, was watching TV, everything was normal. I got up to get a cup of coffee, came back, and there was a piece of a dark braided rope, again in the middle of my living room floor. It’s like a perfectly cut segment, and looks like it may have been a handle to something, but again, I have no idea where it came from, and neither my husband or I recognized it. \n\nAnd I don’t understand what’s happening.\n\nI’m not a huge believer in the paranormal, but I can’t seem to find a good explanation.

But this is my first experience that I’m aware of\n\nI remember waking up early one morning when I was about 10 or 12. Something drew my attention to my bedroom window, which faces south and my backyard, which rises in a slope. I live in farm country, so there’s a farm that borders the yard. As I’m standing there my grandfather (dad’s side) joins me. I don’t look at him, but I know it’s him.\n\nWe’re both looking at this circular mass, which is black with a small, white backdrop. We’re both just looking at this, not speaking. And I can tell my body is still in bed, tho I didn’t realize what was happening had a name. And I didn’t question it either. Nor did I question why my grandfather was in my room.\n\nI’m not sure when, but eventually I return to my body and my grandfather is no longer in my room. I don’t know how long that experience lasted.\n\nMy grandfather had died a decade before I was born. My parents weren’t married at the time either. I’ve heard mention of him once or twice by that point. I didn’t know much of him at the time either. It wasn’t until years later when I finally saw a picture of him. But I instantly recognized him in the picture and knew that’s who I saw those years prior.\n\nI’ll admit to having an imagination and an interest in the paranormal, but the format was never a problem and the latter I never researched or watched until my late teens at the earliest. The closest to a possible influence is my religious upbringing, which didn’t have a great focus on the dead.",

I’m house sitting for a friend of my husband’s family and the owner of the home is away on holiday. His wife died suddenly last year. I didn’t learn this until after my experiences. It was last Saturday when I was getting my daughter dressed, I side stepped to my left and pushed into an energy field of my hip. I didn’t think much of it at all. That night I heard, who I now believe to be the the late wife, walking into the bathroom. It was after midnight and everyone was in bed. Myself, child and souse. It was a bit funny as at first there was a loud step. A stop. Two more steps. Stop. And then the softest steps into the bathroom. I think it’s hilarious that even the dead can’t walk around here without making a racket. This is an old 3 story home. The living can’t walk about without being heard everywhere. If it’s not the legit spirit, could it of been one of those things where the energy is still going thru the motions and should just be cleaned out? I won’t do a thing here as it’s not my place. What I witnessed was so funny and human. Like when you tip toe downstairs for ice cream and you make enough racket to wake the neighbors. So what do you think? What did I experience? Was me stepping and feeling their energy like a ghostly handshake? Last night I didn’t hear a thing because we had the dryer on. When I went up to the third floor, I made a point to yell out, “Pardón !” In a happy welcoming way.  Btw, she died at the hospital. And thank goodness she knows English.",

I think people are easily suggestible or, in the case of my long-ago x-GF(23) girlfriend, just too nice a girl *NOT* to see ghosts. Without her, or their, permission, here's a couple of those about which comments are solicited.\n\n**Naval Tactics Approved by Great Grandma?**\n\nI got a call from an old Navy buddy, in 1985, in port for the day. She and I were casual buddies-only from my last Navy tour, and invited her over to my GFs place for a chat about how her career was going. She started recounting a success she had using simple tactics to defeat a number of warships that were supposed to use her ship, simulating Moskva, as a target. Coordination and communications and **not running into each other** was the goal that stormy night and she notionally zapped all those tin cans to the dismay of the Commodore. But, *she had won!* \n\nAs she spoke, she had stretched out and put her hands behind her head as she joyfully recounted the operation with obvious enthusiasm.\n\nAfter my buddy had departed, GF asked, \"Did you see it?\"\n\nMe: ???\n\nGF had seen a female figure materialize behind my buddy as she proudly recounted her story. The figure was dressed in late 19th/early 20th century garb, a full blue (?muslin) dress with a design, hands demurely folded in front, blonde hair pulled back but nothing distinct in the face. A blur. She was nodding.\n\nI conjectured it was a Great Grandma or so approving of what her child had accomplished. GF looked away and then back again and the figure was gone. I never heard from my buddy again so couldn't pass on this info about her ancestor.\n\n**The only threat is from the living**\n\nThere we were, enjoying a roaring fire in my field camp after I cooked dinner at the end of a hard day going up and down outcrops at +6,500' MSL in Nowhereville, Boonies, Great Basin. No booze/drugs though there is much less oxygen at that elevation, in terms of brain-altering states.  We had a lot of conversation pauses to soak in the quiet and enjoy the warmth. And nobody lived within 20 miles.\n\nShe suddenly said that she had seen someone on the other side of the fire, against the junipers, no more than a face and eyes. It startled her into looking away and was gone when she looked back. She was a bit rattled. I told her that the living were the ones to worry about, not the dead and she relaxed.\n\nI'm guessing he was a shaman who was curious about the GF who could see him and had a look at her.  'Friendly-like.  I, as usual, neither saw nor felt anything. Now I wonder about stuff she might have seen but not told me, during our years together, beyond her dad haunting his house with high frequency beeps, responding to emotional situations in his family, which I co-experienced.\n\nI'll add a couple of strange experiences of my own some time. I remain a skeptic. GF's \"Dad\", for example, turned out to be a leaky toilet. But, the correlation of 'his sound' with entering the house or arguments with her mom is explained then by coincidence and randomness.\n\nRight?",

However, that is not true for the life of my mother who passed away an year ago. She had a number of experiences which could not be deemed mundane.I shall not lay down all of them in this post but focus on some particular incidents.\nFrom the year 2015 my father (now deceased) started engaging in an imitation of Western ceremonial magic since our traditional religion did not help him make money which was of extreme importance then. All our finances had been depleted and our residence sold. We were drowned in debt. My father worked hard but wouldn't get paid and would get taken advantage of by all manners of con-employers. It started with a simple 'rain' spell obtained online and grew into proper invocations and evocations of spirits and their princes etcetera (without blood, gold, gemstones or anything extraordinary). His practice was based on an affordable version of Ceremonial magic from certain online (modern) sources that I shall not name. We saw no success as far as the manifestation of spirits or \"signs\" of their presence was concerned; for that was not even our aim or wish. However our economic conditions improved drastically.\nThe continuation of said practices resulted in night mares, body scars, sight of shadowy figures, mystical dreams and prophetic dreams in my mother. This was followed by the manifestation of a blue faced creature with a long crooked nose, large jewelled ears on random walls in the house - only my mother could see it. I myself never saw it though I certainly saw a curtain shut itself out of its own volition. \nAll of these stopped when we installed our traditional gods in our home and ended those practices. We changed our residence as well (we shifted to another city).\nIndeed as a distant observer and appreciator of Western traditional theurgy, I am curious if anyone else has ever experienced something similar. I am desirous of knowing the creature's name and historical background without engaging in anything remotely spiritual or occult myself - I'm aware that this is not the best place to ask. I know that my writing is not properly organized, and that my question is poorly framed and is probably meaningless. In fact, I would appreciate any opinion on this. \nThank you",

        "text": "Hi everyone. I’m new to paranormal and only started looking through this Reddit today. Why I’m here began with a search on google about something I experienced late last night, and my search almost instantly led me here. I’ve read about this same experience on this Reddit and I thought that I may share my experience as well, knowing that I’m not the only one to have heard what I heard.\n\nSo last night, beginning at around 10pm, I was playing God of War on my PS4 in the living room. I was only a couple hours from completing the story and I achieved that with great satisfaction(amazing story and gameplay). After finishing the game, I put on the next game that I’m wanting to finish and I left it on pause for a good while. I decided to look through my phone and clear some notifications before I got lost in scrolling through tik tok. I noticed that my ps4 went into rest mode and my TV was left on the no signal screen. I went back to looking at my phone again. \n\nAs I finished watching a video of a woman who shared a story about her experience with helping the homeless people in her community, I heard notes from a music box. I turned my head toward the sound, which was the tv and looked around the area of the tv for just a brief moment before looking back at my phone. The tune stopped after just 5 notes and I looked back again at the tv. For a moment I didn’t realize that not only was there nothing on tv, but also there wasn’t anything else around the tv that could possibly make such a sound. I got up to inspect around the tv but only found a lightning mcqueen toy car that belonged to my son and a stuffed Santa decoration on a table beside the tv stand. None of these toys had any wind up mechanic to them.\n\nI stood there for a moment and looked at the time, which showed 2:15am. I had the strangest feeling of disbelief. I couldn’t believe that I just heard notes from a music box that wasn’t there, and the notes played the tune of rock a bye baby. I walked toward the hall way to my bedroom before stopping and I looked around the living room and kitchen once last time. I thought okay, time for bed then I guess. I went to my room, laid down and fell asleep. \n\nWhen I awoke this morning I forgot about what happened last night for only a moment after waking until my wife said good morning to me, then it came back and I told my wife about it. We’re left scratching our heads about it.\n\nI’ve heard things in the house we live in before. I’ve heard sinister laughing before, footsteps when no one else was home and an infant crying from our basement. These sounds I hear only happen late at night. My wife feels that they are remnants of vibrations of the past from prior occupants. We’re not sure exactly who used to live here but the house was built in 1975. I kind of feel that this may be the case as my wife and children have also experienced occurrences of strange sounds of their own. They certainly don’t feel threatening, only curious.\n\nThank you for reading.",

        "text": "Maybe i planeshifted to get to my human physiology exam. \n\nMaking a long story a little short. I live a little bit far from my university usually I take the bus near my house at 6:05 AM and arrive at about 7:50/8:00 AM. The fastest day until now was the day after the \"Quarta Feira De cinzas\"(In a little bit of a direct translation, the wendsday of ashes) that is the following day of the last day of Carnival and here in Brazil usually  the streets are much more empty 'cause the great majority of people just can do something to just not go to work in Thursday and Friday after the Carnival. That fastest day I arrived at 7:29 at my university. \n\nNow with this background explained I can say what happened today. I got on the same bus as always and went on my way to university. The bus was a little bit crowded 'cause we are having some problems with the train system here and as my bus goes for the majority of the route alongside the train trails, many trying to avoid the bad train system got on it. The streets were not especially empty nor nothing like it, in fact I got on the same slow area of the route as ever(it would be a 5 minute part of the route, but with the amount of cars and transit, I usually take around 15/20 minutes there). Same as always I got on traffic and took 20 minutes there. And the rest of the way was going normal. \n\nBy my calculations I was gonna arrive at university at around 7:55 or something like that, and I'm usually pretty good at guessing time that it would take to go somewhere. It was not a real problem since I would be arriving in time for my exam anyway. \n\nWhen it was 7:00 I got to sit down and as I had almost one hour, I was gonna do some last minute revisions on the respiratory system, but I was washed away by a feeling of super sleepiness and drowsiness. I thought it would be better to sleep a little bit, as Yesterday I went to sleep a bit late, I thought i was not in my best mental state. I fell asleep, but woke up around just 19 minutes after with my classmate that takes the same bus as me saying I would miss the stop. First I looked at my clock and it was 7:19 and no way I made a 50/60 minutes ride in 19 minutes, but when I looked in the window. It was exactly that, I was almost at my stop. At first I felt strange, but set it aside since I was gonna have a pretty hard exam. Now I thinking about it... It was pretty strange, the drowziness, the long way in just 19 minutes on a normal day. Don't know, maybe the driver had the best route of his life, but I still find it strange \n\nTL:Dr:I made a 60 minutes ride, I'm just 20 minutes to my university",

At first I thought it was explainable by chance\n\nBut one thing I will remember my all life and will never think \"it was a chance\".\n\nI got high on methylonidat (amphetamines) and marihuana. After this combinations your thoughts are loudest and goes outside your head. I came to see my parrot. It's an african parrot (that's the full name) called Kukik. I love him very much. He can't live without me and is so happy every time he sees me.\n\nSo I'm polish and he talks polish. I will write exactly what happened.\n\nI rerely get that high. I came to see him with my girlfriend and he got so excited, because he hasn't seen her very long time. She used to live with me in my parents house and he called her name when he was angry or wanted something (just like I did)\n\nSo when we came both on high to see him, he started to talk. We were silent all this time, it's very important. We just came and said nothing. African parrot van learn up to 15 words, he's not very good talker, but understands everything. So he have us a show of everything he can and then I thought \"you're great\" in polish.\n\nYou know what happened? He stood still for a second and then start running and said the same thing fuzzily.\n\nSo what do you think?\n\nMy parrot repeated my thought. Because it's a parrot. (My girlfriend heared that too, but she didn't knows what it means. I told her and she belived, because she started to notice people can hear her thoughts earlier this year, she has schisophrenia, but I've learned it's a hallucunations sickness, but supernatural abilities sickness. She has it normally, and I only on high)\n\nPic is him and me.",

Both my great great grandmother and my great grandfather had passed inside the house and there was a rumor that my great great grandma was still wandering the house. \n\nWithin the first two weeks, things would happen beginning with this incident:\n\nMy son was two and struggling to sleep in his own room, it was twice the size of his old room and not as cozy. Around midnight he would get up and climb into bed with us to sleep but one night he didn’t want to sleep, he wanted to watch tv. I told him no it’s night time and he started to scoot back and off the bed when something made him freeze. He looked behind him and looked scared at something that I couldn’t see and dove under the pillows and stopped trying to leave the room. He was speech delayed so he didn’t talk much at this age yet and couldn’t explain what he saw. \n\nWe would hear footsteps coming down the hallway fully expecting it to be him and it was no one. \n\nEvery night between 9-10pm we would hear a slam from the kitchen area. Nothing was ever there. \n\nMy grandfather died after had had been there for three or four months. I was still nursing my daughter who was 6months when he passed. He loved coffee and I would get this strong scent of coffee during middle of the night feedings - in a room furthest from the kitchen and at 2 or 3am. \n\nI could’ve sworn I saw his ghost the night he died, floating past our back sliding door. \n\nWe left after a little over a year and a half. Never looked back- our son slept in our bed the entire time. Our daughter would talk to no one, sing songs, and wave at no one. \n\nIt was strange for sure.",

        "text": "This is my 4th story to tell on here. If you have followed the rest, you will understand when I say this takes place 2 months after the “Santa Muerte” incidents, and days after moving into the new house. So let us jump into it…\n\nAfter we finally got a new house rented, my BF went back to his nightly gym routine. From his first night gone, around 7 o’clock at night, I noticed these flying ants, for lack of better description, roughly a half inch long, all over the house. A ridiculous amount. Naturally, I got up to investigate where they were coming from.\n\nI noticed they were coming in from the window unit (AC) in the living room wall. I turned it off, killed all the ones I could, and realized at around 8pm, they were gone. What I didn’t realize until 9ish… is that the dead ones were gone too. Disappeared. Into thin air.\n\nThe next night, again, around 7, I hear a loud rattling noise coming from the living room. I jump up, worried one of the animals had messed with something, to see the metal chain on the ceiling fan swinging hard against the light dome, causing the rattling/clanging noise. As soon as I walk into the room, I see ants shooting out of the AC once more. Again, I kill as many as possible. Again, by around 8pm, they disappear. \n\nWe used to have BFs niece and nephew stay with us ALOT. At least every weekend. The ants/clanging chain lasted about a week, and suddenly stopped. Now, we took the AC apart and never found a nest or anything. So where they had come from who knows. \n\nAnyway, one afternoon a couple of days after the activity stopped, the nephew was laying on the sofa and asked who had been messing with one of the fan blades. When we look up, we see what look like 3 fingers had been dragged across it. Ignoring it, thinking it was there before we moved in and we just hadn’t noticed, I cleaned the blades the next day.\n\nThis fan was too high for even my 5’10” hight to reach without a step ladder. We lived there for around a year. The only other thing that happened, was a month or so later, as dust had accumulated once more on the fan, the 3 marks reappeared on one of those blades. The day after for the last time, the chain was made to swing hard enough to hit the light dome. \n\nI call this the tall entity, because whatever caused the marks had to have been at least 6’5” just to be able to reach up and touch those blades. Now, I know this isn’t the scariest of stories. It’s not even the scariest that has happened to me. But I want to document these out in the order they happen.\n\nSee you next week, when I post the next story.",

So recently I picked up a wooden shelving unit a few days ago off Facebook marketplace for free. I was a little surprised it was free because it’s solid wood and in pretty good shape. It’s a little antique ish looking too and it’s in my room and I use it for my books. \n\nAnyway, a couple nights after I got it, I turned off my living room TV to go to sleep at about 11:30pm (my place is small and you can easily hear what’s going on in the living room from the bedroom). I was laying down for about 20 minutes when I start hearing voices talking from the living room and immediately I think to myself “weird I could have sworn I turned off the TV”. So I get up and go out to turn the tv off, but it’s already off, yet the voices are 100% coming from the speakers on my TV (it’s not a separate speaker system). It’s just 2 women chatting, I don’t recognize the characters or what they’re talking about. So I’m looking for the remote because I’m obviously creeped out, and one of the women goes “I don’t get how they don’t understand  that they have monsters inside them”. So I find the remote, turn the TV on, and it goes to the normal Home Screen (just streaming apps) and the women are still talking and nothing is playing. So I turn the TV off and it all stops. Thinking back the weirdest part was that I had been laying in bed for about 30 mins and then randomly the voices started. The TV was 100% off. Not sure what to make of it all but I’m getting rid of the shelves and I guess just want to know if this is a regular thing with electronics and paranormal?",

They often bark at particular person in the house and look behind him or next to him, not directly at him.\n\nWe have also had missing objects in the house such as scarf or headphones that we remember bringing into the house but then they disappeared. We have looked everywhere and deep cleaned the house and they’re nowhere to be found. \n\nAny ideas of some more rational explanations here? Have any of you heard of any similar stories and know what could that be or are we going crazy?",

        "text": "So, back in 2002 I moved out and got my first apartment in Emmaus PA.\n\nIt was swell, I just always felt like someone was looking over my shoulder, and I always looked down the hallway when it was walking by.\n\nSometimes, at night, I would feel the corner of my bed bounce like someone kicked it or sat on it. Once, I even woke up at night and saw a blue orb next to my head. Of course, I punched at it, and literally fell out of bed. I just assumed it was a dream.\n\nEven once my buddy was over, we were walking down the hallway and he just passed out cold and crumpled onto his back.\n\nI was there for perhaps 8 years, and a new neighbor had moved in. He was a teacher at the high school next door. We were on his porch drinking, and the other next-door neighbor came over. Now I never knew this guy, but we all got to talking. He said one night he was sleeping on his couch and saw a woman in the hallway. He got scared and closed his eyes, and when he opened them, she was gone.\n\nThe teacher neighbor said that he heard in 1982 a teacher was killed in the apartments. Now, being a skeptic, I blew it off as a scary story while boozing.\n\nAfter I moved out, I decided to check it out, and sure enough, in the very apartment I was staying, a teacher was brutally murdered (stabbed like 24 times) in the bedroom. Anna solt was her name. The case is still open. They never found the killer.\n\nIt still gives me goosebumps to this day",

So we just thought that words she used were all just quite silly.\n\nShe did have the worst birth in the world whereby we were very close to losing both mother and child - my daughter survived with broken bones and there is no doubt the trauma she suffered.\n\nShe's a very quiet child and often talks to us about stuff that you wouldn't normally expect from someone her age. She now dreams really vivid things about people now in her teens\n\nI should mention my wife has gone through life with a spooky habit of \"knowing things\" but has tried to shut it down when she had kids as she \"didn't want to know anything\". She has awful dreams but rarely speaks of them.\n\nAnyway, it dawned us not long ago that my daughter was saying \"lay\" for milk which obviously, to us realising now, is the french word \"lait\" - for milk.\n\nI litterally have no clue how she might be aware of that as one of her first words. My wife and I took french classes at school - but that's where that ended. I've only just started to put everything together and realised it was something very peculiar. \n\nAny ideas from anyone would be amazing!",

She came to me and told \"why are you here this place isn't safe for you, you shouldn't be here\" but I continued to be with her so we were walking and talking, granny was in a hurry to send me out of that glowy world where she herself was glowing . Then on the way comes a church and my granny stops there and tells me that  \"now you go my child God bless you and don't come to this place, I'll be happily living here.\" Still I wasn't ready to leave that place so one shock kind of thing did hit me hard and I was out of that world breathing heavily in my bed and that was the time around 4.30am.

Do tell me, why do we need an evolutionary trait to tell that just because something looks human, doesn't mean it is, and if it were because of some other species of human like some believe, why would it invoke a disturbing feeling of something being wrong and that you need to leave as soon as possible.

(at least I thought) We went out here to ride, and we spent half the day riding. But like on the last half hour of daylight we stopped to look around and just chill out and admire nature. \n\nI was looking at the trees, and I saw this what looked like a woman with a dirty white dress and long blackish hair in the tree probably 50 yards or so from where we stopped. I pointed it out and he seen it too so we got the hell out of there. \n\nThen about a week ago I went out of state to my hunting cabin with my buddy and I had this weird, sudden urge to go into the woods at like 2 am. I did what any logical human would do, and went out there. Me and my buddy decided we would only go out to my stand and back just because we were bored and curious for answers. We go to my stand and I looked at it and had an odd feeling so I climbed it a some and noticed the ratchet strap holding it to the tree was snapped. I told him and then we started hearing weird screams so we got out. It sounded like someone said “help me, please don’t leave. Help me!” Another thing to add was that there were trees laying down like they were snapped, but there were no signs of any cut trees or nothing. \n\nWe got back to the cabin and I told him about the white dress girl and he said he seen it too. Pulled out Snapchat and looked at the map. Turns out where he seen it and where I seen it was in the same woods, just opposite ends. \n\nI’m sorry I made this long, I just thought I’d give every detail I could to maybe figure out what this girl was. \n\n(I live at the bottom end of West Virginia about an hour from Bland Virginia my hunting cabin) \n\nAny answers or ideas as to what we seen and hear would be much appreciated. \n\nLast thing to add: Later that night we seen a tiny green light spin a few times and then disappear",

        "text": "Alright, I finally had a weird encounter again in my apartment. \n\nWas just getting ready— disclosure my breaker does occasionally switch when using the fireplace in the living room— for work was making a coffee and then went back into the bedroom, I noticed the heater in my bedroom was now turned on, the tv was off. (I have tv on for back ground noise) whatever, I thought maybe I just didn’t notice the heater on when I woke up (it wasn’t, but I know my S/O turned it on before bed because they unplugged my salt lamp) and smart tvs usually have a timer, but my screen hadnt been on standby.\n\nSo kinda weirded out, I heard my cat meowing to go on the balcony, I let her out, then turned on the fireplace heater in the living room because it was colder this morning (I keep the door open so she can come and go as she pleases, she never leaves the balcony). I walked back towards the bedroom and finished my routine in the bathroom, to hear the breaker switch followed by what sounded like something running into my sliding door to the balcony. I even saw a shadow so I assume a bird flew into it. So I walked to the living room again, check the heater and it’s off. Checked the breaker box, flipped the switch, then brought my cat in because I didn’t feel like dealing with the back and forth. \n\nI went back into my bedroom was putting on my sunscreen and I felt the heater on still in the bedroom. Weird. If the breaker switched it shouldn’t be on still, but the light was on? Then as I was walking out of the bedroom my breaker box door was *closing* by itself, quite literally right in front of me. I would say it was because maybe a switch flipped and the door was loose? But when I checked the switches all were on? \n\nIdk obviously not super crazy or scary. But I always have a weird feeling I’m not alone when I should be and then weird stuff like that happens. Clearly, not a dangerous entity, but what if it’s someone watching over me? What if they’re turning the switches to either a) stop a fire (idk how long we have had these heaters, but they could probably be replaced by now) or b) trying to start a fire by messing with the breaker box.\n\nClearly, the switches flip when it’s overloaded, but the door closing by its self I mean I literally watched it??? The switch couldn’t have moved the door, let alone open it.",

(At least I think that’s what it was) I remember it very clearly. I used to live in a trailer with my parents and we had a long hallway that led into the dining room and at the end of the hallway was my parents room. My room was on the left with another room connected and the bathroom was right across. We had several old oil paintings in the hall that made it really creepy and I would almost never go down it by myself at night. My nightmares would always be the same, I would think I had woken up from a bad dream but I was actually still asleep. Then I would get out of bed crying and run down to my parents room to wake up my mom, but every time I stepped into the hallway I would feel an evil like presence but I could never see it. Being so scared I would take off down the hall but as soon as I got in the room I would be pinned down  or sometimes picked up by something I couldn’t see. It sounds stupid but it would tickle me and not let me go, and no matter how much I screamed or yelled neither of my parents would wake up. It would eventually end and I would wake up for real drenched in sweat and too afraid to move because I thought it would come back. I’ve never told my parents but I have mentioned the story to friends. I always thought it was a nightmare but several other things happened in the house to make me question if it wasn’t actually a ghost or demon. My brothers friend said he would never stay in the house because he would always here walking up and down the hallway. And once when my brother was taking a shower someone called his phone and it answered on its on. (It was a flip phone and was in the other room) In high school we took the trailer out and got a house built in its spot. I never had any creepy problems in the new house.",

Anyhow, a couple years ago I was taking a shower either at my best friends house or my house and I heard a sound, and it scared the hell out of me. I looked downwards and noticed a penny rolling towards the drain and sadly, fell into the drain. It’s probably still there to this day. Today, about 10 minutes ago, I was in the basement brushing my teeth and I was filling up my mouth with water from the fossil and I heard a sound and as I put my head up a little bit to split the water out I saw a penny chilling there dead center of the sink. Like, wtf? It generally creeped me out lmao. I threw the penny across the room and yelled “I don’t need your two cents!” And now I’m upstairs in my bedroom telling everyone what happened. I’ve heard that spirits can take certain items and move them but is it possible for them to allegedly drop a coin like that? Also, I’m in the process of moving out so the only thing on my sink counter is a bottle of toothpaste, a toothbrush, and a waterpik.",

Maybe yall can help me with this but it got me shook and now I sleep with a Bible next to me and it hasn't happened since. Thanks yall for listening \n\nTldr: possibly saw a lower demon of the devil and decided to run at it to protect my sisters",

When I was in the middle of drifting off, I saw a catish looking tail, it seemed like it was curved. Of course when I look at it, it disappears. Then I keep seeing a small tiny head poke out of the door frame, I originally thought that it was one of the cats, but when I looked at it, it was gone. \n\n   The other shadow figure was around maybe 6’0. It just stared at me until I looked at it, then it went away, this happened about twice. \n\n    I’m usually not experiencing this paranormal stuff, but I’ve been a little connected with the other side after I lived in my so called “haunted house”. I’ve been around spirits and demons, I just make sure they don’t touch me. I’m not very sure if what I’m experiencing is just me being tired and seeing things at the corner of my eye.

This story takes place at the other one. They are about 20 minutes away from each other, and this one is even more rural than the first. I’m talking about corn fields on three sides of the building. \n       When I work the morning shift, I have to be there before we open, and when no one else is there yet, and it’s usually PITCH black outside. Context for this next part: the corn has been chopped down at this point(like a few inches high), the building is not near the owner of the field. On this day I parked and looked outside. I thought I saw something/someone standing in the field about 20 yards into the field, but it was dark outside and hard to make out. I convinced myself I was being paranoid and that it must be a leftover piece of corn or machinery, although I could have sworn it was shifting its weight a little. I ran inside and locked the door behind me (would have done this anyway, I don’t want people coming in that don’t work there) and went about my day. \n          That day when I left, it was light outside, and I had pretty much forgotten about the thing I saw. But when I walked out of the building back to my car, I couldn’t help but notice that there wasn’t something there anymore. Meaning it was not corn or any stand still object. I don’t know what I saw, but I’m positive something was there in the morning. I told this story to my parents, and I was met with “it’s fine it was probably just a person”. Which to me, is STILL terrifying! The fact that at the very least, someone was staring at me from a corn field in the dark, while I’m by myself, in an area where literally, no one would hear me scream.",

(at least I thought) We went out here to ride, and we spent half the day riding. But like on the last half hour of daylight we stopped to look around and just chill out and admire nature. I was looking at the trees, and I saw this what looked like a woman with a dirty white dress and long blackish hair in the tree probably 50 yards or so from where we stopped. I pointed it out and he seen it too so we got the hell out of there. Then about a week ago I went out of state to my hunting cabin with my buddy and I had this weird, sudden urge to go into the woods at like 2 am. I did what any logical human would do, and went out there. Me and my buddy decided we would only go out to my stand and back just because we were bored and curious for answers. We go to my stand and I looked at it and had an odd feeling so I climbed it a some and noticed the ratchet strap holding it to the tree was snapped. I told him and then we started hearing weird screams so we got out. It sounded like someone said “help me, please don’t leave. Help me!” Another thing to add was that there were trees laying down like they were snapped, but there were no signs of any cut trees or nothing. We got back to the cabin and I told him about the white dress girl and he said he seen it too. Pulled out Snapchat and looked at the map. Turns out where he seen it and where I seen it was in the same woods, just opposite ends. I’m sorry I made this long, I just thought I’d give every detail I could to maybe figure out what this girl was. (I live at the bottom end of West Virginia about an hour from Bland Virginia my hunting cabin) Any answers or ideas as to what we seen and hear would be much appreciated.

        "text": "Sorry if this the wrong place to post this\n\nI'm new here so as a basic introduction, I'm generally a skeptic but I do try not to rule out any option entirely.\n\nWhen it comes to ghosts/haunted places there are a lot of things that just don't make sense to me, one of them being the places and occasions in which ghost activity happens.\n\nUsually haunted places tend to be asylums, sanatoriums, mansions where gruesome deaths/suicide happened, etc. - the first thing I always wonder is why aren't places like Sarajevo or Hiroshima ghost magnets. Or the Covid wards where enough people died to have convoys transporting the coffins out back in 2020.\n\nHowever out of all of these, my main question is: why not slaughterhouses? I've heard stories about ghost dogs and ghost cats. Yet never such a thing as a ghost cow. Research has shown that cows are even more intelligent than dogs and 300 million cows are slaughtered each year. Why would a house where a single dog/cat died become haunted, but not a slaughterhouse where thousands of cows get killed every year?\n\nThis is my view as a skeptic of course and I do welcome different opinions, but it seems to me as if it's mostly the result of suggestion where the \"creepiest\" places always turn out to be the most haunted, rather than those where most death and suffering happened (let's face it, a mansion has a lot less death and suffering per square meter than a Covid ward). Similar to how ghost apparitions tend to happen at night, which is naturally \"creepy\" for us.",
