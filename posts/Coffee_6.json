I live on the east coast, and sometime about 8-12 years ago every coffee shop near me switched over to a VERY bright, acidic bean...in fact a new roaster opened up and literally EVERY BEAN they offer could be described as bright. At some point someone told me this had been a west coast trend that eventually made it east, but I'm not sure.\n\nI personally don't like bright, citrusy beans (BRIGHT not Light, mind u, there's plenty of rich chocolately light roasts I enjoy), and I'm surprised this would be a preferred flavor for the general coffee drinking public (ie people who aren't low-key snobby about their coffee, like meeee).\n\nBesides the taste, I'm annoyed by this trend cuz every extremely fancy coffee shop owner neglects the non-dairy milk situation , which is that if you put any non dairy milk in a bright , really acidic coffee, it immediately curdles. And I cannot understand why nobody seems to care to solve this ???\nI think u could solve this by buying : non dairy creamer (expensive ), or just switching to a less acidic bean ¿???????\n\nI like to drink coffee black if I like the bean or make it at home, but if I'm getting a coffee out, and it's bright, I'd rather cut it with some kind of milk and unfortunately I'm a non dairy person ( I assume regular milk doesn't curdle ?)\n\n\nWhat is my question ??? God idk\n\nI guess WHY BRIGHT\nAnd also why does nobody care about the milk?????\nAnd also AM I the only one who feels this way about bright, citrusy beans ???",

This is a problem because my friends and boyfriend know me as 'the coffee person' and give me beans as gifts quite regularly -- only they get them from non-specialty roasters so these tend to be blends and roasted darker than I like. This isn't their fault, and I'm touched that they care about my hobbies, but I just don't know how to brew these beans in a way that makes a decent cup of coffee. Do I need to add milk, and if so how much? Is there other stuff that can cut the ashy aftertaste? Do I have to brew differently? I usually use Aeropress or French press and take it black but this just isn't working. Help me, r/coffee, I don't want to waste the many bags of beans currently sitting in my pantry!",

However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.\n\nThere are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:\n\n- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Official Noob-Tastic Question Fest weekly thread, posted every Friday, would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions.

Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!\n\n- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.\n\n- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet.

        "text": "Hi everyone! I bought a clear glass Fellow Atmos vacuum storage (that I keep in a dark, cool cupboard so no need to address that right now) a couple of months ago and have loved it. Recently, I bought a much darker roast than usual from a local roaster that was *very* oily; to the point that the whole beans left a visible oily residue on the inside of the glass. I didn't like the flavor as much, so I put those beans instead into a little ziplock bag and called it a day. In case it's relevant, the flavor notes were listed as: Earthy, tobacco, hops, and rye. They were very accurate in their description!\n\nI then cleaned out the carafe thoroughly with soap and warm water and no smell or residue remained. For the lid, however, I know that the cleaning is different and you have to be careful not to let much water come in contact with it. I did what I usually do, and gently wiped it down with a wrung-out paper towel with a small amount of soap, then a second time without soap. I noticed that there was still a lingering smell of those oily beans on the inside lid but didn't think much of it.\n\nSince then I put in another bag of whole beans (medium roast with a totally different flavor profile) in my Atmos and after about a week and most the coffee gone through, I can still taste some of those darn oily beans (not sure if it's relevant, but I grind my coffee fresh each day for french press in my humble Baratza Encore and have thoroughly cleaned my french presses more than once between these beans. \n\nOn a final note, I've ground coffee that wasn't stored in the Atmos during this same period and haven't had this same problem with the oily beans' flavor presenting in the cup so it *might* not be a grinder cleanliness issue. \n\nWhat are y'all's thoughts? Has anyone experienced this, and how did you fix it?",

This was the winning recipe and he [posted](https://friedhats.com/blogs/news/the-definitive-friedhats-brew-recipe) it online a couple of days ago, although it was on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck7zTq-jIYo) for a while already. The recipe:\n&gt; 20g of coffee to 300g water – a 1:15 ratio = a juicy mouthfeel\n&gt; 50g bloom at 62 degrees Celsius. Bloom for 30 seconds.\n&gt; Add 150g of water at 90 degrees Celsius.\n&gt; At 1:10s add the third and final pour of 100g grams.\nTotal brew time is about 2:30s. There is no stirring, swirling, rinsing the filter paper. He mentions the importance of using good water though. I figured out he uses the Japanese Hario V60 filter paper (40pcs box, VCF-02-40W). He uses an Origami dripper but V60 is fine obviously. For reference, he states that grind size should be around 22 clicks on the Comandante.\n\nI've just tried the recipe using my V60 and a washed Ethiopian coffee from the Yirgacheffe mountains. I'm not very good a describing my coffee, but I got a really tasty cup out of this recipe. Better than I usually get from my V60. Very fruity, flavourful, balanced and clean I would say. Workflow on this was a bit weird since it requires water of 2 different temperatures.",

I'm not very well versed in the coffee world, but are there any special kinds of coffee that can only be found in Japan that they'd be stoked to receive?",

Is this an acquired taste, or have I just not had a really properly made espresso? I have no desire to be espresso at home, just want to see what all the fuss is about, people make it seem like it's this rich decadent thing, but all I taste is something I'm not \"tough enough\" to take straight.",

        "text": "I recently tried a coffee roaster with attached cafe in the Dallas area. There are a few of these and they’re all varying levels of good to great. I usually buy bags of beans to make espresso and pour over at home. I prefer getting whole beans this way as opposed to a subscription because of the variety of trying new beans and roasts.  \n\nAnyways, I get to this new place and realize that the bean packages don’t have a roast date. I ask the barista about it and he confirms that the roasters only give an expiration date, not a roasting date. I asked if I will have more luck asking a roaster directly (they weren’t there when I went but presumably would be there on a weekday) but he said they probably wouldn’t. \n\nIsn’t that weird?  Some other reason they won’t tell me a roast date?  Is there some standard formula I can use to figure out roast date (I.e. 8 months from expiration date)?",

I have a Bambino and I’ve never see any espresso have that kind of consistency. Do I need a different/better espresso machine to achieve that or just grind finer?",
