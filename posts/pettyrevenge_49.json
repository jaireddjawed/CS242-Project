        "text": " This was a pretty recent event for me, but unfortunately I can't talk about how happy it made me at work. Maybe you guys will enjoy it?\n\nI took a skilled manufacturing job to put myself through college. Everyone is at least 10 years older than me, but I've been working in the field since I was in high school. I'm at least a little better than the average employee -- basically I can do any job that a non-management employee is allowed to do. Just about everyone likes me because I'm one of the few people who can work unsupervised and I'm ridiculously meticulous, but there's ONE lady who's constantly a jerk to me. Her name is Bobbette. She loves telling everyone how her name is French, and she thinks she's better than everyone because she brownnoses our boss and is the oldest person in the department (55). Apparently, she thinks if she shows off how well she can manage people, she's going to be picked as assistant manager (despite the fact the department already has one, and he's not going anywhere). Whelp, she \"shows off\" her management skills by bossing me around because I'm the youngest. \"Oh honey, let me show you a trick so you can do your job better.\" \"Are you sure that's the right tool for the job?\" \"Maybe you should let me do this, you young bucks are so inexperienced!\" \"You know, I can do this better than you and I never even went to college!\" It's a daily thing she's been doing to try and make me look bad, and because our manager likes the attention he's been getting he doesn't care.\n\nI've been at this job for two years now, and I FINALLY found a way to get back at her. After yet another monologue of unsolicited advice, I just looked at her with a blank face and said, \"thanks, Bob\". Her face looked like she just sucked a lemon; I've never seen a coworker get that angry before. It was one of those things were you could tell that \"Bob\" had been used as an insult a lot in her life, probably one of those schoolyard insults from childhood that cuts deep. Another coworker piped in \"who's Bob?\" and I said \"oh, you know, Bobbette! I call her Bob since we're such good friends\". Someone else started quoting lines from the movie \"What About Bob?\" and soon the whole department was in on it. Choruses of \"Bob. Bob. Bob? Bob! BOB!\" could be heard throughout the day; she had to play along and pretend she enjoyed the joke because she couldn't look bad in front of so many people. But the best part? It stuck! Now everyone calls her \"Bob\", and there's nothing better than seeing that subtle jaw clench every time someone says it.",

        "text": "TL;DR at the bottom. Mobile sorry blah blah blah okay we get it tell the fucking story. \n\nSo I am your average white Irish girl. And while I may look like English is the only language I speak, I’m pretty good at speaking Romanian and French, and can pick up a good bit of other Latin based languages. But anyways on with our story. \n\nI was stuck in London at 4 in the morning. I had come out to meet a friend and while we were out there, shit kind of went south surrounding getting home. So now I was stuck on this early hours bus with the straggling drunk people trying get home. I’d had a long, stressful day, and I was sober, exhausted and cranky.\n\nThen these three guys from Angola jumped on the bus. I knew they were Angolan because they kept fucking shouting it at the top of their lungs from their seats. They also kept shouting other obnoxious and stupid shit like, “I AM ISIS! THERE IS A BOMB ON THE BUS!!” among other things.  \n\nThis was not long after a terror attack had occurred in London, so this was doubly douchey and stupid. Everyone was clearly uncomfortable and irritated by these guys, so much so that the bus driver pulled over and gave them a stern warning. They got all offended and started bitching about the driver. I had been silently glaring at them this whole time, and the mouthiest one of them made eye contact with me and asked, “what’s his problem?” \n\n“You are,” I replied, visibly irritated, “you are upsetting other people on the bus and making a scene.” I was just being honest, no one else was saying anything. The mouthy one kept trying to get me to “explain myself,” but I wasn’t about to get sucked into an argument with someone on the bus so I just went back to being quiet. Then Mouthy Guy fucked up. \n\nHe started talking shit about me in Portuguese. Called me a puta (a whore) and a piece of shit to his friends. These words have almost identical counterparts in French, so I understood exactly what he said, my friends. At this point I was so tired my filter was gone, and I’d had enough of this asshole, so I turned to him and said, “how dare you talk about people you don’t know like that? How dare you talk about me like that to your friends?” \n\nMouthy Guy got cocky, smirking and saying, “I’m not talking about you! You so full of yourself, you think I’m talking about you?”  I just repeated back to him exactly what he said and you guys, the way his eyes widened and his smug little smile fell off his face was so awesome to see. “You understand?” He said in Portuguese, (almost identical in Romanian) \n\nAt this point my sleep deprived brain took over and I went on a tirade against him in rapid Romanian that went along the lines of: “ You are such an asshole, I don’t want hear another word from you, all you do is talk shit! Sit there and don’t say another word!” \n\nAnd then his two friends turned on him and started laughing at him, telling him to jump out the window. At this point Mouthy just slumped down in his seat, closed his eyes and kept silent for the rest of the journey. My friend ended up having a nice conversation with the other two, but Mouthy never said a word. The silence was absolute bliss. \n\nTL;DR Guy chats shit about me in Portuguese after being an asshole. Bad move motherfucker I speak your language.  \n",

        "text": "To set the scene I work at a baseball field, my job is selling ice cream. I like my job, I like my coworkers, but my boss is a cunt (we will call him Scott). It’s my second year there and he has gotten much much worse this year, he’s made multiple people have panic attacks, and a couple people have quit solely because of him. One of the worst things he did involved one of my coworkers telling him he couldn’t come in early because he had to go to his grandmothers wake, and he was scorned for being “lazy”. He has forgotten to clock me out, causing me to stay two hours longer than usual, and he belittles my main coworker for being slow. This is where the pettiness comes in...one night he informs me that we only have 3 bags of ice cream mix (we usually go through 5 a night when it’s a normal game, and this was supposed to be a busy game). This was entirely his fault seeing as he orders it. Now if you don’t leave the ice cream machine at least a 1/4 of the way full with mix it goes into “freezer lock”, meaning you have to take it apart and clean it, which usually takes three hours. After Scott tell us and leave I look at my co-worker and ask “you also heard pour more ice cream so we can leave early, right” he said “obviously let’s go”. We made every cup/cone/and bowl overflow with ice cream, which made people more happy and in turn got us more tips. We worked on Ice cream for a total of an hour and a half before running out of mix, and by the end of it we accumulated 35 dollars in tips. Feeling like we won I told my co worker “alright let’s clean up and get out of here” but he had a different idea. He says “I don’t want to carry all these ones around, let’s grab larger bills from the register and replace it with the ones”. So we end giving our boss 30 extra dollar bills to count, added to the already 220 single bills that we got from sales that night. He had to leave in the middle of his duties durning a hectic night, he was all sweaty/stressed he mentioned the crazy amount of ones we had in the register. He ends up asking us picking up trash which took twenty minutes, then we talked to fans, and watched the game until we clocked of in the 8th inning. We then got off, grabbed some food from the kitchen, and watched the rest of the game. So Scott if you are reading this, I know you can be a dick and get away with it, but don’t underestimate two bored teens with ice cream.\n\nTL;DR boss is a overbearing cuck, so we purposely use all the ice cream mix, and make him count 30 extra dollar bills causing him to panic.

        "text": "For the past couple days there have been spotty thunderstorms in my area. It will be sunny one minute, and thundering and pouring the next. \n\nYesterday I had gone to a Best Buy to buy a pair of headphones - when I went into the store it was cloudy but clear, when I checked out 15 minutes later it was pouring. Constant thunder and lightning. The parking lot was already flooding with the drainage towards the curb flowing faster than a river. \n\nWanting to attempt to wait it out, I waited under the front awning of the store where two middle-aged ladies - your stereotypical couple of Karen’s - were standing doing the same. \n\nAfter waiting 10 minutes, a young man comes and hops over the fast-flowing drainage to which the ladies clap their hands and congratulate the guy on making the jump. They begin making small talk with me:\n\nLady 1 : “This rain came out of nowhere didn’t it!?”\n\nMe: “Yeah it’s been spotty like this the past couple days. It was clear and sunny when I left my house and has been storming pretty badly on and off.”\n\nLady 1: “Well hopefully it lightens up soon, we’ve been waiting here for about 15 minutes.”\n\nMe (Checking my phones weather radar): My radar is saying it’s supposed to keep raining heavily and potentially get worse with flash floods over the next hour” \n\nLadies: “It’ll probably lighten up - hopefully we aren’t waiting for that to happen for too much longer.”\n\nMe: “I popped open my radar and it isn’t looking good. You might be better off just running to the car now and blasting the air to dry off quickly haha”\n\nLady 1 (irritating tone): “Well we didn’t really ask you”\n\nMe: “Well I guess I you don’t want to know when the hail is coming then”\n\nNow in reality the hail wasn’t coming for another 20 minutes or so, and it probably wouldn’t have even been that bad, but the look of shock on the ladies faces were priceless as they asked “wait! Hail!?” To which I replied “sorry, you didn’t want to know” and left. \n\nI sprinted to my car to avoid as much of the storm as possible. When I got to my car I saw the ladies walking out of the store and subsequently step into a large puddle on their way to their car. \n\nHopefully they beat out that hail. \n\n\n\n",

These are my favourite pastimes. \n\nAt this gym we have a guy by the name of “jihadi” John. He likes to argue with everyone. About anything. He figures out your point of view and then argues the complete opposite. Its so bad he will piss of the Vietnam vets and has scared people out of the gym. In real life he is as left leaning as you can get, and actually a nice guy, just likes to argue with people. I’m the only person that can get under his skin, because while I am left leaning, I also argue the opposite. It just so happens that i only argue the opposite of whatever John is championing that day.\n\nAbout a year ago, he started a campaign and arguments against the royal family, cue me coming in campaigning for “the firm”. For every fact he has about them, I have a counter argument (I have my major in history). It gets so bad he storms out. I then set the sound system up that the next time he walks in Rule Britannia starts to blare throughout the gym. I have also set up strategic pictures of different members of the royal family on his favourite machines, and occasionally play documentaries about them. \n\nThe recent royal wedding was lots of fun. The Vets enjoyed themselves. I haven’t seen John for a few weeks, and I have only recently switched back to regular music.\n\nTL;DR I played devils advocate with a devils advocate. Don’t piss off the guy who can change the music.",

        "text": "Apologies in advance for any poor formatting, I’m writing this on my phone. This happened a few years ago at work and I was reminded of it when I came to this sub.\n\nEveryone at work had a good relationship with each other even if we didn’t know or work with them directly. Twice a year, we would hire new people as some of the uni students left to start new jobs and still, everyone got along. For this reason, nobody had a lock on their locker - nothing had ever happened since the store had opened 4 years ago at the time.\n\nOn a particular year, we hired a new batch of people and suddenly things started to go missing from the female locker room. It started off with one of the international students. I sent her on her break and she left only to come back a few minutes later, claiming she wasn’t hungry. She looked  quite upset so I asked if everything was ok. \n\nSomeone had gone into her locker and stole her last $20 which was supposed to be for her food stretched for three days. I felt terrible that she felt ashamed to admit that and lie about not being hungry. I was also extremely furious. All the workers including myself earned the same amount (obviously unless you were a manager) and she was an international student who most definitely needed every cent. I became fixated on finding out who it was that was stealing.\n\nFor the next 4 weeks after that, money was stolen 4 more times and also some of my makeup and brushes from my makeup bag was stolen (If you’re wondering why there was theft four times after the first, it happened to casuals who only worked usually one day during the week. They also didn’t read the signs management put up about employee theft going on but in their defence, they just come, work, go home. They should not have to worry about theft in their own staff room).\n\nAll the theft that happened helped me narrow down who it was though - a new employee and female of course, worked on these days at these times. There was only one person and she was a muthafckn dodgey ass person to begin with anyhow. I went to the managers with what I found but they couldn’t do anything because it clearly wasn’t enough.\n\nI was still infuriated about the international student and what a horrible feeling it must have been for her to think that she was going to starve for three days so I went home with my makeup bag that I leave in my work locker to “change” up some of the product in there.\n\nI mixed cayenne pepper in my mascara, got my boyfriend to wipe his ass with my makeup brushes and then left the rest of the makeup. There bitch, you can take my makeup now.\n\nSurprise, surprise, she did take it or at least tried the newly improved mascara on because we crossed paths in the hallway that connected to the female locker room and her eyes were all watery and red, including the skin around her eyes. I just smirked at her as I passed. I didn’t see her reaction though because I went straight to my locker to confirm that my makeup bag most definitely had been touched.\n\nAfter that incident, she only worked for a few more days and left. I’m not sure why and if I had anything to do with it but there was no more theft after she left so I didn’t give a crap what the reason was.\n\nWasn’t the best idea doing some biological warfare on her in retrospect. At the time though, the way I saw it was that $20 equates to 1 hour of work and basically those people just worked for nothing and they really needed that money. Writing this out is giving me some Vietnam flashbacks to how angry I was but fuck you you thieving piece of shiet who’s name I’ve forgotten!",

One day, he was practicing at the court near his old college, and saw somebody peeking in the little window by the door. My dad went out to see who it was. It was a sophomore who was pretty timid and apologized for distracting my dad, (the guy could tell my dad was really good at racquetball) who laughed and asked if the guy wanted to play with him. The guy said he barely knew how to play and didn’t want to get in my dads way but my dad said he’d love to help him out. About 30 minutes later, after some friendly help from my dad, the guy was having fun and thanked my dad for the help. Enter douchecanoe. Douchecanoe was the cockiest, douchiest guy my dad had ever seen and he asked if he could play threes (in racquetball, three people can play in the same game) to which my dad said sure, the more the merrier.  Douchecanoe was going all out and beating my dad, (who wasn’t trying because he wanted to help out the sophomore), and the poor sophomore down. Douchecanoe says “If I knew i was playing with amateurs, I wouldn’t have asked to play at all HaHaHaAHaHa”. My dad walks over to sophomore and says, “Why don’t you sit this one out *winks*”. My dad walks up to Douchecanoe and says, let’s play one on one. Douchecanoe scoffs and says, “If you really want to lose, then sure thing hahahahaha”.  My dad proceeds to Beat. The. Living. Shit. Out of Douchecanoe. Douchecanoe gets completely aced. He didn’t score a single Douchecanoeing point. He stands there, mouth open, and my dad, who was 5”2 to douchecanoe’s 6”0, walks up to him. Pokes him in the chest and says, “If you want to play racquetball, I’ll play f*cking racquetball”. And Douchecanoe turns and leaves. The end. ",

He only looked at the first slide of the PowerPoint before saying everything looked good but demanded that I put their names on the front and I just pretended that I had forgotten. That night I put their names on the PowerPoint but put a line through them like ~~so~~.

The timing wasn't perfect and we knew that, but our first kid was at the upper limit for sibling closeness so we decided to go ahead. Now, DH's family is well known for gossip and shit talking everyone and anyone. It was no surprise to us to hear all the awful things they were saying but I could ignore it as it was all general shittiness. Direct attacks on the other hand I cannot tolerate.  \n\nAbout a month before my due date my younger BiL comes to me at a family gathering and strikes up a conversation. We had always gotten along and I would at this time have referred to us as both friends and family. He lets me know that MiL has been telling him and everyone else that she was not going to practically raise child like she had my other one and that I would just have to step up and deal with it. \n\nImmediately I felt as slow burning anger rise up in me. She had invited me to live with them after my first child was born because my DH had suddenly been assigned to another work location and would be in another state M-F for at least a year. So yes, she did help a lot the first few months but by no means did she raise the kid (except when she was way overstepping her bounds by administering medicine without asking). \n\nTime goes on and I start being distant as I can tell that my temper is getting worse. So finally, the big day is here, and I am in labor. After returning home with my wonderful newborn all the family stops by to bring food and check in as is the norm. \n\nEach person asks for a turn holding the babe and cuddles  and smiles are had all around. When it gets to MiLs turn I look her dead in the eye and say 'no'. Just that, no, and nothing else. For the next five weeks I would not let her near either of my children. \n\nWhen she could no longer take it she asked me why I was keeping her away and I told her what BiL had confided in me. She apologizes and says she really wasn't thinking about what she was saying. As far as I know she hasn't said anything similar in six years. \n\nTL;DR \nMiL talks shit about having to raise my first kid so I refuse to let her hold her second grandchild. \n\nAs a bonus petty revenge:  When I initially told her we were planning on moving about an hour and a half away she laughed and said we would never leave our hometown. So what else could I do but move four hours away to the other end of the state?",

I was the only female mechanic, which had its ups and downs, but one perk is that I essentially had my own bathroom unless there was a female driving student, which was rare. \n\nUpstairs from the shop were the offices and reception for the school. There was always a bit of friction between the shop and upstairs because the office people tended to think they were better than us, and the women in particular often acted quite snotty.  \n\nWell the office women realized my bathroom was usually empty, so they started coming down to poop in it. They had their own bathrooms, but they liked the privacy of mine. However, to get to said bathrooms required walking down a long cordoned off section of the shop past everybody working on the cars, so I started pointing them out to my coworkers. “Oh, look, Tina is going to have a poop!” Eventually everybody who worked in the shop knew the office women were coming down to take a shit, and there would be a substantial amount of giggles for every long walk down that corridor. One of them finally asked what was so funny when they ran into one of the mechanics at a bar. Didn’t see them down in my bathroom after that. ",

That being said I decided I wanted to sell it for a great deal just to get it out of my yard. I post an add online stating what the problems with it are and being straight up about everything. \n\n  A few hours later I get a call from a teenager sounding voice saying he was interested in buying my truck,  and then I hear in the background someone in Spanish ask some more questions about the truck so I realize this kid is translating for his dad. Now I speak fluent Spanish but I figured I would just keep that a secret for now. They plan to drive over and meet me to see if we can make a deal. \n\n  They show up and I talk to them in the strongest southern drawl I can without being obvious. The dad asks his son to ask me to pop the hood and show them any other problems. I do just that revealing every little thing wrong with the truck. Now this is where it gets good.\n\n  The dad says in Spanish to his son “See if you can get this dumbass down 500 dollars” (Well obviously when you sell something online you know to price it above what you want because they are gonna bring it down to your actual price.) \n\n  I tell them that I will accept that and then the dad says “I can tell this white guy is hurting for money bring it down 400 more and if he doesn’t it take it well just act like we are gonna leave” while looking at the tires trying to make it look like he’s talking about something on the truck. \n\n  I respond to them in Spanish “I think what we agreed on was a fair price and you trying to bring it down because you think I need money is just rude, come on inside and pay the price we agreed on and we can call it a day, if not our business is done here.” I said it very calm and not aggressive but the look on that dads face was great! He said “I..I didn’t know you spoke Spanish making me look like stupid. I think what we agreed on is a fair price. Us Colombians just like to talk a lot of shit” \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Most of the customers understood and were not too bothered.\n\nBut there is one customer who it clearly seems is bothered... This guy has been calling up over 300 times per day since Monday and saying absolutely nothing. It has increased the amount of calls we receive each day by about 20%. \n\nThe agents are targeted on % of calls they are able to convert into sales so it has caused quite an issue between them. No idea what the managers are doing but it's proving more difficult than they expected to be able to block the number.\n\nWhich leads to me being able to sit back and listen to shouts of \"Fuck sake not this guy again\" and watch managers running about trying to get through to the people in charge of the phone servers. \n\nKudos anonymous caller, you are providing me some much needed entertainment on this Friday afternoon.

He was a year ahead of me in school. One day late into my first semester he found my dorm room and told me he was transferring into my college. Cool, he and I will commute 45 minutes to college for my second semester freshman year. Save the dorm &amp; food fees.\n\nMy sophomore year we rented a 1 bedrm apt. We thrived. We formed the hottest band on campus. {He guitar / lead vocal, me bass / lead vocal} My junior year, I signed the lease alone, invited him back. I also had to go to work full time in a toxic chemical plant. Worked 12 am to 8 am, Sunday evening to Thursday evenings. I was going to college carrying a full load, feeding myself, maintaining a car, playing pledge master, fully loaded.\n\nDuring a late autumn Saturday night, Barry brought over his girl friend. She had been kicked out of her right wing religious school and was pissed having to transfer in. She wanted to fight with me about my faith, her lack of faith and how awful religious culture upset the faithful with silliness, arrogance, and pettiness.\n\nI was not having any discussion, I tried to retreat to my back bedroom (railroad apt) and she would not let go. I was dead tired and need rest since I had been burning the candle at both ends the last 5 days. Nope, Susan had to blame me for her lack of progress at the previous school. I was pissed, so pissed that the next day, I informed Barry his rent half would not be needed my second semester jr year. He was out. If he could not control his girl friend's mouth in my personal space, neither she nor he would be there.\n\ntl;dr: College roommate allows gf to heckle and mock me about my faith, when I really needed rest. Both gone from my life when the semester ended. 2 wonderful fraternity brothers moved in.\n\nN.B. A few years after college Barry started dating an ex girlfriend, one I wished gone, he took her away and I was relieved, they later married and had a happy, great life together.\n\nedit 1: My faith and religion are mine. Yours are yours. If you don't like mine, tough. Your whiny ass voice is not going to change my mind and I am not out to debate you, I needed rest, my college success depended on it.\n\nedit 2: Did not meet requirements of regular revenge therefore, i.e. here at petty revenge.\n\nedit 3: Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.\n\nedit 4: &gt;one I wished gone,         \n{our sell by dates for each were expired, she was a wonderful woman, just not for me,}",

They never got around to hiring anyone, so the owner was supposed to come in and do a couple shifts so that I could train him, but he kept blowing me off.

I wrote the denominations down, but did not set the cash drawer up for him.  I put frequently used items in out of the way places so he’d have to hunt them down.  I set out stacks of wax ice creams cups for the day, but first I put them in the oven just long enough to melt each stack together: grab one, get 10.  I glued the tops onto the empty water pitchers that were kept on the counters so that he would have get get water for each customer.  I turned all of the gift shop products upside down.  All of the framed art and promotions?  I rehung them upside down.  All of the ice cream flavors  velcroed to the menu board ?  Upside down.  \nSince the company used no artificial dyes, the chocolate chip and mint chocolate chip look just the same.

        "text": "Sorry maybe a long one but needed to vent! Ok, a bit of context. 3 years ago I started out as a freelance Web/graphic designer. To supplement my income while the business was in it's infancy I got some work as a delivery driver for a local pizza shop owned by an Iranian fella.\n\nAnyway as of last month I'd worked for him on and off for 3 years, I felt I knew him well, as far as to call him a friend.  A few months ago business was still ok but it had started to go downhill because a new takeaway has opened up next door and taken a lot of their business. He decided to spend around 5k and completely redecorate the shop because it looked a bit tired compared to next door.\n\nOne day he asked me to design him a new menu to fit in with the new shop design but at the time I was working on quite a large project for somebody else so didn't really have the time to do it. He insisted he'd pay me well and I could take my time with it. I quoted him £200 as a friend thinking that it would probably be around a weeks work in total  and also agreed to design him a new logo, shop front sign, and some banners. \n\nI also noticed that on his current menu, the Web address he had printed on there wasn't actually connected to any website. Upon further inspection I noticed nobody even owned the domain. So I bought it for £1. I added it to my server, made a quick landing page and added a button with a link to his app so people could visit the website and order online, thought it would be a nice surprise. So all in all not a bad deal for £200. That last part plays an important role later on however.\n\nNow I'm selling myself way short here, but figured I'd do it to help him out. I felt bad quoting loads when business wasn't so good. Anyway a few days go by and I go into the shop one day and he asks if the menu is finished, I told him it's nearly there and will be ready. All of a sudden he gets all arsey and starts saying he needs it ready for the world cup. I remind him of the other project I said I was working on and told him I'd do my best.\n\nFrom here on I receive none stop calls and texts harassing me for the menu, so rather than get angry I pull a couple of all nighters and get it finished for him. Long story short, a few days later he says he doesn't like it and said he'd got someone else to do it for cheaper, then basically refused to pay me anything for it. I kicked off. I'm not an aggressive person at all but I called him a cunt basically. He promptly sacked me.\n\nAnyway, one of the other drivers who I got on really well with informed me that he was using the new menu I designed. Apparently he paid £2500 to have 40,000 of them printed out.\n\nUnfortunately for him they all contained the Web address that I bought for £1. I made that url redirect to pornhub. I paid £30 for 1000 fliers that simply said:\n\nwww.nameoftakeaway.com\n\n 'Order online now and get 50% off your first order!'\n\nI had these delivered around the local area, especially targeting the regulars. He came round to my house and threatened to fuck me up, which I thankfully have on video thanks to my ring doorbell.\n\nIf I really wanted to be a true cuntlord 3000, I could show it to the police, get a restraining order against him and then go and work at the takeaway next door, meaning he can't step foot in his own business. Probably doesn't work like that irl but it's a funny thought! \n\nTL;DR - Boss asked me to design a menu, refused to pay me. Used it anyway. I bought his domain name that was printed on the menu. Redirected it to pornhub. ",

        "text": "This story was just told to me by my dad, so I'm not sure how much it true and how much is speculation. But still, it is a little funny in the end.\n\nSo, in my dad's neighborhood, there is this dude who does a pretty amazing amateur fireworks show on the 3rd of July (let's call him FG for fireworks guy). The family has been doing it for a few years now and the whole neighborhood will show up to watch them. Last year we all gathered in the neighborhood soccer fields (it's a big southern neighborhood) and the show was pretty freaking great for just consumer fireworks. We had cops and the fire department there just in case something went wrong. \n\nSo this year as FG prepared for the fireworks show, he went to the fire marshal and got everything he needed to have a better show than the last year (because the show improves every year). Over all things are looking good and these southern folks are ready to celebrate the Fourth of July with a literal bang... Except on the 3rd, that way everyone can go to the city fireworks on the 4th.\n\nOr so we thought.\n\nApparently some neighbor, that we are convinced hates all things American and freedom related, complained that this dude did not have a permit for a gathering of over 50 people. We can call him HOF for Hater of Freedom. HOF had gotten the police involved and they had to shut down this neighborhood's festival of freedom. And so, the show could not go on.\n\nBut, ladies and gents, we all know the show must go on. Americans take their yearly freedom spectacular very seriously. The Fourth of July is the time of year where we leave out our Twinkies and Beer for Captain America so that he may grace us fireworks to appease the Gods of Freedom. You get me? \n\nSo, on the 3rd of July, instead of setting up shop in the soccer fields like last year, FG and his family set up in his cul-de-sac and blocked it off with cars so there would be no gathering. Once the spectacular amateur show was finished, to be petty, the rest of the neighborhood decided to light up their own fireworks. So for hours on the 3rd of July, the sound of fireworks could be heard all over the neighborhood for a few hours.\n\nAnd to make it even more amusing, a second amateur fireworks show happened again on the 4th of July, followed by more neighborhood fireworks set off in every direction. For a few hours.\n\nMy dad is pretty convinced that an extra 5 grand was spent on fireworks by this neighborhood for a few hours of fireworks on the 3rd and 4th of July, just to piss of HOF because he messed with their Festival of Freedom.

        "text": "This happened last year, I used to work as an English teacher at a large chain school in Japan. \n\nThe work culture at this school was very bad, and the Japanese staff were very arrogant towards the native speakers.\n\nWe weren't supposed to have our own classrooms, we were just meant to take what was available at any given time. However, one particularly short tempered  Japanese (ethnically) English teacher, (let's call him K), liked to use one particular room, and got upset if anyone else used it. I usually tried to avoid that room, but on one particularly busy day I had no other choice. Although K didn't have any more lessons that day, I could tell he was a bit annoyed.\n\nAfter the lesson, I was approached by a counselor who told me that K wanted to speak to me. As I entered his room, he simply gestured at a book that had been left behind on the table. This shouldn't really be a problem, because we had plenty of books, he was obviously just trying to assert his superiority. I wasn't really sure if it was me that had left the book there, but I grabbed it anyway. On my way out he said \"Do you have anything to say to me?\" I simply replied \"No\", and he went ballistic. I had never had any trouble with K, so I was a bit taken aback. He screamed at me in a mixture of Japanese and English about how I was acting like a toddler and I was a stupid gaijin. Then he started insulting my nationality. I just let him vent until I had had enough,and then walked out into the lobby. He followed me and started yelling at me in front of my students (all adults). I was later informed that he filed a complaint against me for disrespecting him and making a mess. Keep in mind that he wasn't even my superior, we had the same job. The only difference was that he was Japanese, and older.\n\nNow for the revenge.\n\nI knew my friend (call him J) would be getting transferred to the school in a few months, and he was willing to help me, so I decided to wait until then to start messing with K. By that time, K had basically forgotten about the incident and all was going well.\n\nK's oral hygiene wasn't the best, so I decided to help him out with that. On J's first day at the new school I chucked a bunch of toothpicks into K's room. K was visibly agitated and confused, but eventually decided that a student must have accidentally dropped them there. The next day I coloured some dental floss with red whiteboard marker, and left it in his room with the \"how to floss\" wikihow on the classroom computer. At this point, K knew someone was messing with him, but couldn't figure out who. J then started teaching all the students about dental hygiene, and getting K's own students to make him fill out a survey on the topic for their \"assignment\". K was furious, but he didn't confront J because J is Japanese and the same age as him. Instead, he watched J like a hawk, hoping to catch him red handed, which made it easier for me to sneak into his room and put toothbrushes in his books, smear toothpaste on his keyboard, and put Listerine in his water bottle. To further alleviate any suspicion on me, I even snuck in on my day off (I live just around the corner). \n\nThis went on for weeks, the whole time J was diverting suspicion away from me and onto himself. Whenever anyone left for the day, J would call \"Don't forget to brush your teeth\", or \"have fun flossing\". Most people just thought J was strange, but K knew it was really directed towards him. I even got one of the students in on it. He walked up to K and said \"Hello K, my hobbies are brushing my teeth, and flossing, what are your hobbies?\" \n\nI was going to get one of my student's children's teeth so I could put it in K's shoe, but he left abruptly before I had the chance.  I tried to figure out where his new workplace was, so I could send more toothbrushes through the mail, but he cut all communication with the other teachers at the school.   \n\nMaybe we went to far, but it was funny at the time. If I ever see him again I'll tell him it was me, apologize, and offer him a breath mint.",

We fixed student computers and also the school computers and faculty-assigned computers. Working there for a few years, I got to know many of the faculty, some of which I had as professors. One of my professors, we'll call him Dr. C, was generally a nice guy but sometimes a bit harsh and stubborn (imo) when it comes to his classes and grading. Sometimes that's the best way to learn and all, but it's also a pain in the ass.\n\nMy last 6 months of school I was promoted to a staff member in IT, which meant I was now scheduled for 30hrs per week but typically worked about 40. I took over a extremely specific branch of support and my predacessors had left 6 months prior, leaving me to learn the job on my own. I also had 15 credits on top of this. Pretty nuts, but it was only 6 months.\n\nOne of my classes that semester was an advanced stats class with Mr. C. We used lots of Excel and SPSS. Mr. C was not the most tech savvy, but knowing I worked it IT, he would often look to me for help here and there if something was off, and they were always small so I didn't mind.\n\nOne week, IT rolled out a new online course system that put many of our facility in disarray. I ended up working quite long hours that week as a result. I stopped by Mr. C's office and asked for an extension on the assignment we had due that afternoon because I was slammed at work (second time I had asked for an extension in my entire school career as a B+/A- student). His response was, no sorry, I'm afraid I can't give you an extension. You still have a few hours before class though.\n\nFine, that is his right as a teacher, so I went and hacked out a mediocre assignment and turned it in on time. You better believe though that during that class when the computer started having issues and Mr. C asked, \"does anyone have an idea how to fix it? ....Anyone? ....Anyone?\" I just sat and watched. \n\nI still feel a bit bad about it because I try to 'be the bigger person' in those situations, but oh well!\n\ntl;dr - professor was unwilling to give me an assignment extension after a long week at my campus IT job, ignored his need for help fixing the podium computer during class.",

C was a decent worker, always pulled his weight and was always on time. Unfortunately C liked the sound of his own voice a little bit too much. He would do this thing where he loved to speak over the stores PA system and took any opportunity to do so. He would page maintenance for a tiny spill that would have taken two seconds to wipe up with a paper towel. \n\nNormally his stupid PA system habit wouldn’t be a problem, but he would always be a douchelord and page people over the PA and tell them to return to the meat department. He would do this even if they were on break or lunch and if you ignored him he would keep doing it. This also makes the employee being called look really bad because it sounds like they are slacking or taking to long on their breaks. Our manager even had to talk to all of us about how long of breaks we were taking. He would even page people that were still in the department making them look bad for no reason. If you weren’t in his immediately line of vision, he would reach for that fucking intercom instead of just looking around for a second to see if who he was looking for was in the cooler or something. \n\nSo what I did was is I got in the habit of kind of sneaking around the department a little bit. Especially if I knew he was looking for me. Finally he looked around for like ten seconds and then sure enough he started walking towards the PA. I waited until I he said my name over to the whole store and then I popped around the corner and yelled “IM RIGHT HERE.” As loud as I could. It came over the intercom and as well as the sound of him stuttering and trying to hang up the PA. He kinda hung his head as me and one other guy were just laughing at him. \n\nA few minutes later the store leader called all the managers for a quick meeting. About 15 minutes after that, our manager came back and told us that only managers and leads were allowed to use the PA system anymore. So all in all problem solved.",

        "text": "It's been 5 years since this happened and i'm still insanely bitter about it.\n\nDuring my final year in college (in the UK, so its like senior year in high school) I was completing a course in computing.\n\nI was the only girl in a class of guys, so my lessons consisted of trying to learn about computers...and listening to these talk about the most crass topics, even watching porn in class and generally just using the lesson as a time to mess around.\n\nIt was so bad even my teacher couldn't control them, I began to stop attending my lessons and work in the library instead, my teacher caught me once and he just accepted that I was better off working out of the classroom.\n\nIn the last three months of my course we where put into groups however. I was put with 4 of the smartest guys in the class. Things where going well, these guys actually wanted a good grade and we worked well together. We had a bunch of work to do, and this work would be allowed into our exam. \n\nEverything was going fine, all the sections assigned to each person where progressing nicely...but then I realised none of us had actually seen the section one of the group member was meant to do.\n\nI asked him every lesson for it, and he would give me a status update about where he was...and yet he always forgot to bring it into school. Alarm bells in my head.\n\n1 week before the exam I beg the guy to let me look over the work. He wouldn't show me. So I took matters into my own hands. I spent an entire weekend doing the work he was meant to do, but I didn't want him to benefit from my work at all.\n\nThere was a shared folder of our work that would be sent to our entire group, including that lazy sob. BUT we where also allowed to take in a few sheets of notes. My cunning plan: I printed out the work I did, and handed a copy to each member who had been pulling their weight. \n\n20 minutes before the exam the lazy guy comes over to me in a panic and makes some excuse up, \"my computer wiped out all my work, im so sorry I didn't submit that section, but mistakes happen, right?\". I just shrugged, walking away and said \" sure, mistakes happen\". \n\nWe start to line up for the exam and thats when I hear him talking to another guy, \"wait, whats that print out? no I didnt get one...\" And then I feel a tap on my shoulder, it's lazy dude, \"hey you did the section already? I didnt get a print out\".\n\nSuddenly the examiner walks out of the exam hall and tells everyone to start making their way into the hall. I smile at the guy and just say, \"oh sorry, mistakes happen, good luck.\"\n\nWe all passed the course with high grades. He ended up with a D, so it was still enough to graduate, but wasnt too great for his University prospects. \n\n TL;DR: Guy didn't do his section of group work, potentially causing the entire group to fail. So I did the work and gave it to everyone except the one who was too lazy to do the work. Everyone passed with a high grade except him.",

        "text": "This was a couple of years back, 2008/2009ish? I was in my teens and my brother was a preteen. He got a PS3 which he can only play during the weekend and I got my first laptop which I can only use during the weekend. \n\nOur parents were strict in the the sense we only can 'play' the night before weekend and during the weekend. That's it. So if we wanted more time on our respective devices and good internet speed (our internet provider was very shitty; it took half an hour just to download a 2MB file), we usually get up at 6 in the morning of the weekend because that's when the Internet speed is at it's peak and be able to use it till 10am. Then we can we use it from 3:30ishpm till 8pm. This is really important.\n\nNow, I usually read manga and surf the web while MSN chatting with my friends online when I get my laptop out. My brother plays his games on his PS3. We share a room so we talk about what we're up to. I ask him about what's happening in the game and he asks me what manga I'm reading. All family love and jazz, of course, until the Internet speed dips. Then he lags when playing and blames it on me. I get upset too because the sites start taking forever to load but I don't blame him. We fought and argued about this a lot.\n\nAnyway, when the PS3 requires updating, he needs to update it or he cannot play. Which really sucks. And because of how absolutely shit our internet is, it slows down to the point of being non-existent occasionally. When this happens during PS3 update download, it gets interrupted and he has to start the update download all over again. This makes him cranky and he thinks it happens because I am on the internet at the same time. Now, I don't claim to understand how this internet usage thingy works but really, it isn't my fault that the internet is so slow to the point that his PS3 mistakes the internet connection to be gone.\n\nAnyway, one day before the weekend, he asks Dad to ban me from using internet for the next day. That boy got a silver tongue and he smooth talks Dad into banning me from using it for the day. Dad asks me nicely to not use it for the day. I fuss a bit and reluctantly accept my fate. But I'm seething inside. Why am I banned from it for a day? My brother isn't banned the day after so it really isn't a fair deal. So not fair! I grind my teeth and I wait. I wait patiently. After all, patience is a virtue.\n\nThe next day, he's up at the crack dawn, trying to update the PS3 software. The first time it reached 2% before failing to download the update. The second time it's progressing smoothly so far. No hiccuping internet. The day goes on, I'm bored out of my mind on my internetless laptop, still waiting while my brother keeps checking the progress of the download. I, too, slyly keep checking how far it came along. 10%- not yet. 42%- not yet. 58%- not yet. 79%, still waiting, watching the bar slowly crawl towards the end. Each time, he would grin and sigh of relief that it was going well. Me? I just I bide my time and wait. If I'm going to get even, it has to be when it hurts the most.\n\nAt about 3ishpm, he went to shower. Before he went, he checked the progress  (at the time was 98%) and switched off the TV. \n\nI wait till I hear him start showering. Now is the time for action. I make my way towards the router. He takes about 5 minutes at the most to shower. I gotta be real quick with execution of my plan to take into account a variable that I cannot control. I switch off the router's power supply for about 15 seconds and then switch it back on. It shows the usual starting up light gives away that the power went off recently. It takes a while for that light to disappear and was the one variable I couldn't control. But it disappeared quickly enough and the router resumed functioning like it did before.\n\nSo I'm on my laptop, playing solitaire innocently when he comes out of the shower, singing with such joy I was feeling inside. But I play it cool like the good actress I am. Getting caught would mean getting grounded and staining my good child rep. As I anticipated, the first thing he does is check the progress of the download. After all, it if is one percent closer to being done, he would be ecstatic.\n\nLo, and behold, the download was sadly interrupted due to the internet connection being gone :( The poor guy had to start it all over again. This means that all his hopes of playing any PS3 that day was gone. There was no way our internet would be fast enough to complete downloading the update before 8pm. Thus, I had completed my goal of revenge. If I don't get to be on internet, then he don't get to play his games. After all, we siblings have to stick together, through thick and thin ;)",

        "text": "LTL, PTP, so sorry if formatting isn't great.\n\nI live quite a 15 minute drive from a huge shopping center - it's the biggest in my country. So you can imagine that when I need to get some clothes or standard goods you can't get from a supermarket, it's my first choice. I'm a regular and know where the best spots to park are, because even though there's a number of car parks (parking lots for Americans) around the shopping center, the car parks can fill up pretty quickly (given the number of stores here).\n\nAround a week ago, my girlfriend and I decided to stop past after work when there were end of financial year sales for a lot of shops. It's not easy to get a spot around this time given everyone else generally has the same idea, but I digress.\n\nAfter moving at a snail's pace from the freeway exit to the entrance of the shopping center, we finally get to the turn to enter one of the main car parks. However, our entrance is blocked by a car waiting to turn out. No worries, we're happy to wait a minute or so for the car to turn out so that we can enter the car park. Almost all shops in this center are open until 9:30pm most days of the week given its size and popularity. However, the car behind us obviously isn't as patient as we are. A 50 year old woman (who reeks of \"I want to speak to your manager\") and her teenage daughter in a shiny new Mercedes Benz are looking at us as if to ask, \"do you know how much a minute of my time is worth?\" Let's call this woman Karen.\n\nNow, I've got a pretty short fuse, and this becomes at least 50&amp;#37; worse when I'm driving. Luckily my girlfriend is the same, so we usually share a mutual level of road rage when one of us drives. However, we decide to let this slide. It's been a long day, and I'm sure Karen has had an even more stressful day getting brunch with her girlfriends and posting about the importance of body oils online. However, when we get another honk not 10 seconds later with the typical \"move your car\" hand motion, I decide that she needs a nice lesson in patience and respect.\n\nWhen the car moves, my girlfriend and I decide it's safest to drive extra carefully in case any pedestrians move in front of our car. Given the path to turn into other areas is one way for the first 30 metres (\\~100 feet), my girlfriend keeps her pinky toe on the accelerator while we make our way along the path. All the while, we're watching the great spectacle of a middle-aged woman who's realised she can't talk to our manager to get her way. Then lo and behold, the gods have been watching over us! A pedestrian makes his way to a car a little ahead of us. In my girlfriend's wit, she decides that she's going to patiently wait for this guy to unload, get in his car, and leave. But not before moving her car slighly towards the centre of the lane so that we can't be overtaken.\n\nAfter 30 seconds, Karen tries to maneuver herself to get around us, only to realise the gap between us and the parked cars is JUST too small. It probably takes around 3-4 minutes of waiting before the man takes off in his car and we reverse into his spot. We then get to watch this delightful woman flip us off as she drives past, while we return the favour accompanied what I can only imagine would be the most smug look in the southern hemisphere at that moment of time.\n\nI love when the universe aligns itself in ways like this.",

        "text": "LTL;FTP \n\nHi guys, this happened about a month ago and I thought it might fit here.\n\nIn each of my office floors there will be a scanner/printer in each quadrant, but only two are functional. I had to scan about twenty pages or so. So I went to the scanner nearest to me and saw 3 people in queue already to use  it. I was not in a hurry so I decided to wait, no issues. There was another functional machine available 1 minute away from it though.\n\nI waited until the people in front of me finished and began to scan my documents. As I was about done scanning my second page, another guy came to stand behind me to use the machine. Let's call him Impatient Jerk-Off (IJ). I  try to be nice to others.... well, most of the time. So I was about to ask him it will take long time for me to finish so if he was in a hurry he could use it before me (since I scanned just two pages, no big deal).\n\nSo I say \"I have a lot of pages to scan, so.....\" . Before I could finish IJ interrupts me and says \"I wanna use that right now\". Waving a bunch of pages right in front of my face (probably he needs to scan too). Congratulations IJ you just pushed the \"Wake up\" button to my Inner Jerk. So I smile and turn back to continue to scan my papers. I made sure I double checked the scan settings (dpi, color, page size) for each page. After 5 or so pages he called me and asks how much of scanning is left. I showed him my bunch and said \"This much\". (I regret not waving my papers to his face like he did). I could see him fuming and running out of patience. He was tapping his leg on the floor, muttering, clearly frustrated. I gotta tell you I never knew scanning could be so satisfying. He could have gone to the other machine but for some reason he chose to wait. Good for me.\n\nHalf way through I got one more idea to annoy him more. I took my phone and called my friend who is alos in the same office. But I addressed him as my Boss and I pretended I was asking about the scanning then I told \" Oh you need them as separate files not single ones? Ok, will do\". Then I hung up turned to IJ shrugged and cancelled my scan. Then I began to scan and send pages one by motherfucking one. At this point I could say for sure that even the bug up his ass got pissed. Hehe. I finish my scanning taking good 20 minutes or so to make  IJ wait. Then I turn to him and say \"It's all yours now\". He gave me a death glare with his red eyes (I might have made him cry or he was about to choke me to death). Me with a big grin on my face opened the door and went on my way.\n\nTL;DR - Impatient Jerk was too rude to hear my act of kindness so I returned him the favor.",

        "text": "Apologies in advance for format, writing in mobile.\n\n\nI am a manager at a national pasta serving restaurant chain ( fast casual dining) and I had a manager there who was one of the meanest people I ever met. Let's call her Kay.\n\nKay was only promoted to manager because she was the most qualified person and longest working employee (only 3 months at the time) for the shortlist of manager candidates. She consistently made snarky comments about customers and employees behind their back, made others do her manager duties, and always showed up late and left early. I always received the brunt of the force because I worked the most with her since she and I were always scheduled together due to me being in high school at the time. Eventually, she feared she was going to lose her job and decided to work at a place were we catered to on occasion. The work environment gradually got better and I myself was eventually promoted to manager.\n\nFast forward nearly a year after she quit/was fired and Kay started coming in regularly to get food. She becomes a regular and came  usually 2-3 times a week with her husband. At this point most of the crew had changed since she worked since most employees were high schoolers and had gone off to college. I happened to be working in the kitchen that night when Kay and her husband came in. Some of my fellow employees had been telling me they've had bad experiences with her; not as fellow employees but as customers. Kay still remembered the menu  and often customized dishes to the point were it wasn't even the same dish anymore. A typical night included her eating half of it, then sending it back because it wasn't to her liking while groaning how this place had gone downhill. One night Kay came in while I  was working and finally had a chance to get my petty revenge.\n\n You see, every once in a while someone will come in and ask for their dish to be spicy. No problem with that, we usually just mix siracha into the dish while cooking it. Kay decided to order Extra spicy. Big mistake (for her). I take over cooking from a kid who was working that night and personally make it. I added, spicy buffalo sauce, siracha, hot pepper flakes, a spice ingredient our restaurant sells, ground up crispy jalapenos, and to top it off,  an absurd amount of siracha sauce. Usually that dish is a whitish, yellowish color. After I was done with it; dark red and was almost soup-like. I also decided to take the dish out personally to her table. I give her the dish and say \"Made extra spicy, just for you Kay\" and then walked away. I had some employees go out and keep and eye on her throughout the night. Apparently she was sweating in a 68 F restaurant and had a bright red face the entire time she was there. After they left I went and bussed their tabled and discovered she only at half of her pasta. It's been 3 weeks since this happened and she hasn't been back since.\n\nTL;DR Former boss who was cruel to employees comes back a year later after quiting , mistreats newer employees as a customer and gets her ass handed to her by me and an extra Spicy Pad Thai dish.\n\nEdit: Grammar \n\n",

        "text": "I am a recovering alcoholic and stayed in a substance abuse facility about a year ago. The facility was co-ed, and had reasonably strict rules regarding room visits and contact between sexes. The room visit policy was that there could be mixed genders in rooms, but there had to be a minimum of 5 residents present and you must have permission from staff first. Fair enough.\n\nI was on my way to my room and happened to walk by a female friend on the way up the stairs. We stopped at the top of the stairs and chatted for a few minutes. I saw no issue with this, as far as I knew we were not violating any rules in doing so. One of our \"recovery coaches\" saw this and did not seem to agree with me. We'll call this man Kevin. Kevin is an arrogant guy and doesn't like to proven wrong or made a fool of. Neither do I. Kevin and I didn't get along so well. Kevin stormed into the stairway and began shouting at both of us for having an inappropriate room visit. When I calmly pointed out that we were not in either of our individual rooms, and were in fact in the public stairwell, this only seemed to enrage him further.\n\n\"You're not fucking stupid, idonteffwiththewar. You know damn well that these rules apply to other areas of the building and you're just being a punk now about it.\" Kevin proceeded to strip away a bunch of privileges from me and place the both of us on a \"gender ban\". \n\nAll the while, I continued stating my case that I was doing nothing wrong, and that if I somehow had, it was not with malicious intent. He accused me of clearly not being able to read the rules that are clearly posted on the wall.\n\nI decided to take him up on that and read the rules for myself.\n\nOne of the rules stated something along the lines of how room visit policies apply to other areas of the facility, including gym, swimming pool, etc. Etc. Rather vague and open to interpretation. Okay. I suppose that could include the stairway. That really complicates things but oh well. Guess I'll go and inform the other clients of this policy.\n\nBy the end of the day, I had 30 other clients approaching that staff member every time they needed to use the stairs. Since it was brought to my attention that the stairs were now held in the same regard as the swimming pool and the gym, this meant that no client could pass through there alone. They must either have 4 other clients with them, and they had to inform a staff member of their intention. \n\nNeeded to go get coffee? Gotta ask staff so they could assemble and approve a group of 5. Wanted to step outside for a smoke? Gotta ask staff so they could assemble and approve a group of 5. I was front and center of it all insisting that if Kevin allowed any individual client to use the stairs without 4 other clients present, then this is yet another example of an inappropriate room visit, and must be treated as such. He began to get flustered and backpedaled on his claim, but could not come up with any reason why this should be treated any differently than my situation. He eventually reluctantly said that there did not need to be 5 people in the stairwell.\n\n\"So to be clear, there are no stipulations in regards to passing through the stairwell? I just want to be clear because we have like 15 drug addicts here who want to smoke, or go to the recreation room, or, ya know, ETC, but we also wouldn't want to be breaking any rules.\"\n\nHe admitted there was no such rule, returned my privileges to me and lifted the gender ban off of me.\n\nThen I decided to be even pettier. Since it had now been brought to my attention that there was no official handbook rule regarding hanging out in the stairway, I began to assemble get-togethers in the stairs with up to 10 people at a time to bypass the room visit restrictions. Kevin did not like that but did not know how to shut it down. They eventually put in place a rule that movement within the confines of the stairs must remain consistent due to potential fire hazards and they must only be used as a means of getting from one place to another. That logic sat well with me so I didn't fight it.\n\nI don't know that I got a whole lot out of rehab. But I'll be goddamned if I didn't follow the rules. ",

        "text": "Been lurking on this sub for a while, figured I’d finally share the one revenge story I have.\n\nSo back when I was a freshman in college, I was living in an on campus dorm. Most of the people on my floor were pretty chill, but there was this one guy who would always scream at the top of his lungs when he was gaming. I’d get woken up a lot to this guy screaming down the hall, so he quickly became the bane of my existence. (We’ll call this guy “A”) \n\nAs the year progressed, a lot of the gamers in the hall began to game together in each other’s rooms. As luck would have it, they eventually chose to always game in the dorm directly across the hall from me. I was friends with a guy that lived in that room, who wasn’t really into gaming. As a result, he would come over to my room because five or six loud guys were cramming into his room and he couldn’t study or relax. All of the guys could get pretty loud, but “A” was consistently the one who’s voice would dominate all the others and continually get under your skin. You’d try to say something to him or the other’s but it fell on deaf ears.\n\nThe tipping point came when my friend and I discovered that “A”, who would play at my friend’s desk, was stealing his food. My friend’s desk was nowhere near the other roommate’s side of the room, and it should have been painfully obvious to anyone that the food that was tucked away at the back of the desk was not free for the taking.\n\nWe were now completely fed up with all of this, but we weren’t really sure how we could get back at him. That is, until one day when my friend and a couple other friends of ours were at a store, and we walked by some laxatives. We pooled what little money we all had, and bought the laxatives in both tablet and liquid forms. \n\nWe ended up crushing the tablets into powder, and then opened up a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos and mixed probably three or four tablets worth, figuring that most of the “laxative dust” would fall off the chips, and only about one tablet’s worth of laxative would actually end up being consumed. The liquid laxative was lemon flavored, so we bought some lemonade vitamin water, and topped it off with the laxative. We then placed the laced food at the very back of my friend’s desk, so that if “A” decided he was going to be a decent person and not steal someone else’s food he wouldn’t suffer.\n\nThe food was gone within five minutes of him coming over to game. My friends and I patiently waited outside in the hall by my door, and after a while “A” burst through the door and sprinted towards the bathroom while yelling to the others in the room to play without him. He spent the rest of the night in the bathroom, and it was the first time in a long time that we were able to enjoy a night of relative quiet.\n\nTl;dr: Guy in dorms is always making a ton of noise and stealing my friend’s food, we get back at him by lacing my friend’s food with laxatives.",

        "text": " This actually happened a few months ago. \n\nI was with my friends at a water park and we were waiting in line for a ride. We were at least 10 minutes in waiting for the ride when a girl sneakily slipped past my group. \n\nAt first I noticed but didn’t pay much attention to it, thinking she was originally there and I was just going crazy from waiting. Then I realized that there was a group behind us and the cutting girl was waving and making motions to them to join her.\n\nBeing the stubborn child I am, I cut off the cutting girl from the rest of her friends by putting my arms out on the railings that were on the sides of the line, and blocked the path. I made sure to put them down once in a while to remain discreet. My friend whispered to me, “It’s no big deal, it’s just one person.” But I was feeling petty, I didn't want to wait extra time for these girls to go in front of us.\n\nAs we made our way to the top, the girl became more and more worried as to how to rejoin her friends. But if she went back to them she would admit that she cut in front of us and I would have won. She started to motion to them with more urgency, but they refused to cut. Now, I admit, I probably should’ve did the mature thing and stop my revenge plan, but I was already in too deep, so I kept my arms up.\n\nThe cutting girl's calm but worried looks at her friends were so rewarding to watch.  \n\n\nIn the end it worked out for everyone. There was extra space as we got onto the ride, and the girl reunited with her friends and we got to enter the ride in front of them. \n\nAll in all, the ride sucked and was not worth the 30-35 minute wait and looking back, my actions were pretty petty.\n\nTL;DR: Girl cut in front of me and my friends. I cut her off from her friends that were behind us for the rest of the line. We claimed our rightful position in front of them at the end\n\nEdit: I changed some wordings",

        "text": " This story just came to a head today so I figured now is the perfect time to share.\n\nI got hired on as an engineer around the same time as two other guys I went to college with at a small family owned business. We're all decent friends and working together has lead to us hanging out more and going to bars after work a lot. Recently, a new IT girl was just hired on. We'll call her L. L is very pretentious and outspoken. Outspoken to the point of being extremely rude at the most inappropriate times.\n\nA little back story on me. I've played drums most of my life. But, being young and dumb, I never wore hearing protection. I didn't wear hearing protection at my first job as an engineering consultant at a machine shop, or on the factory floor at my second job. So consequentially, my hearing is pretty poor. specifically in my right ear. I have tinnitus pretty bad. I've been tested, my hearing isn't bad enough to be a disability, but it's pretty close. Regardless, at all of my jobs, I've made sure to let my coworkers know about my hearing and that if it ever seems like I'm being loud, please let me know. I try and keep myself in check but sometimes I forget, and my coworkers are pretty understanding and don't say much.\n\nSo our new IT girl gets hired and over the course of the first week, we all get to know her. I make sure to let her know of my hearing just so she is aware. Immediately I get the impression that she doesn't seem to believe me. Whatever. Go on with my day.\n\nOur office area is pretty spread out. So, most of the time, people get up and go and talk to others. Pretty normal practice at most places. We have cubicles, but they are huge so usually there is two or three of us stuck in one. My room mate and coworker, B, and I work in one. L, M, and T work in another. There's always talk happening and you can hear everyone. At least once a day, I need to go and talk with the other engineers about stuff going on in the factory and other typical engineering things. It wasn't till about a week later I had my first clash with L.\n\nI'm having a conversation with M and T about an issue with production when L decides to make herself heard. \"God you are so fucking loud\". Conversation comes to a screeching stop. I turn around, apologize, carry on. It wasn't so much that she told me I was loud, it was the hostility that didn't make any sense to me. It wasn't until a few days later I had another complaint shot my way. I'm with our lead engineer, Q, talking about a new design for a product. We're in a cubicle over about 10 feet away with a few walls between us and we both hear, \"I can hear you over here\". Q and I just stare at each other. He mouths \"What's her problem?\", I just shake my head. I had finally had enough when in the middle of talking to our CEO she felt the need to tell me I was being loud, from across the room, by basically shouting at me. Every time I make an effort to apologize, despite the fact that in some cases, I wasn't any louder than the person I was talking to. It's like she had it out for me or something\n\nSo we all go drinking one night. Once a week, M, T, Q, and I all go out for the night. Sort of a \"team building\" thing we like to do. L chose not to come. I'm obviously in a bad mood. Q asks what's up and I explain everything to them about L. None of them seem to understand why she had a problem. They acknowledged that while sometimes, my volume levels were a bit elevated, most of her complaints didn't make any sense and were pretty harsh. I find out over the course of the night that she's basically been bullying everyone into being silent, not just me for the past week or so. That pissed me off.\n\nHere's the revenge.\n\nFrom that point forward, any time I could make an excuse to be around her talking to someone, I was there. I threw all volume control out the window. Loud laughing, cutting up with the sales guy, talking with HR. Hell, I held a production meeting in the middle of the office the door to the floor open just to make as much noise as possible. This angered the silent L. Our CEO was an engineer in the army, and is very too the point. He also has hearing aides as a result of being older and the army. He has a, don't give a shit, don't take no shit. attitude. He's also never there. maybe 3 days at most out of the week does he show up. So for the next couple of weeks, whenever he is there, I'm getting stuff done. I do everything I can to be the stand up employee he wants. When he's gone though, I'm L's worst loud nightmare.\n\nL's finally had enough. She goes to our HRM and complains that I'm harassing her, which, I guess I probably was, but not directly in any way. HR calls her and I into a meeting with our CEO (small business so of course he's there). She complains im being loud, I tell her she's being disruptive by bullying everyone into a silent submission and being incredibly rude and offensive to me. My boss sympathizes with me and tells her he's never had a problem with me being loud. She just explodes. I ask to bring in my other coworkers to let them talk. Basically the next hour is us telling our CEO about what she's being doing the past month.\n\nNext week she doesn't come into work. I find out through the sales guy that our CEO basically told her take a huge pay cut, or leave for harassing one of his best employees.\n\nTL;DR: Apparently I'm being loud. DO YOU THINK I'M BEING LOUD?!?!?! CAUSE I DON'T THINK I'M BEING LOUD!!!!!",

        "text": "Some  background so you understand what lead up to these events.\n\nI was  attending a Christian University about 3 years ago now.  The University  had a very strict \"honor code\" which included no Sex, drugs, or alcohol  use whatsoever, no girls in your room, etc.  I was dating a girl who  lived the next town over, about 30 minutes away, for about 3 months at  this point.\n\nWell, one night, my  girlfriend shows up at my door, crying her eyes out, barely able to  breathe. So, not wanting all of my roommates to see her have a mental  breakdown in the living room, I brought her into my room (I didn't share  it with anyone) and let her calm down. She told me she was just at her  brothers soccer game, hosted at my school, and some guy at the game was  hitting on her, and not caring that she had a boyfriend, and wasn't  interested. He tried grabbing her as she left, and ended up following  her from the game. As I was only kitty corner from the soccer field, she  came to my place instead of her car, as she didn't want him to know  what car she drove.\n\nI saw the guy stop,  turn around and run, immediately after I answered the door. We called  campus security, but nothing was ever found even with our description of  the guy.\n\nShe ended up falling asleep on  the spare bed in my room and I let her sleep. I saw no point in making  her drive the 30 minutes home after being traumatized like she was, at  midnight.\n\nEnter my roommate.\n\nHe  saw she had left her shoes and jacket on the couch, and sat up until  3am, assuming I'd try to sneak her out without being seen. He eventually  demanded she leave, and I told him to \"Fuck off\" and leave her alone.\n\nThe  next morning I get a call from the school, my Ecclesiastical  endorsement, Religious Recommendation, had been revoked, due to Honor  code Violations. I asked them what I violated to deserve being kicked  out and they said My Bishop was told I was having sex with my  girlfriend, and I had 3 days to pack all of my stuff and get out as I  was no longer allowed to attend the school without it. No investigation,  no nothing. The School couldn't do anything about it, even tried to  convince my Bishop(Pastor) to reconsider and get my side of the story  before making his decision.\n\nNo Dice.\n\nSo,  in the 3 days I had left, I signed him up for every single porn site I  could think of. I used his school e-mail, and they monitor our e-mails  and have certain sites set to alert them if they get e-mails from  anything on the \"black list.\" I was hoping to get him in trouble with  the school, and our Bishop, and he did. Well, somehow his Fiancee got  word that he was a \"porn addict\" and she cut off the engagement a short  time later.\n\nI regret nothing.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, he wasn't kicked out. He just had to \"repent\" for his \"porn addiction\" which yeah, the hypocrisy is real.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nJust  gonna say, I still am religious, I have no issue with the church itself,  the culture is another matter. Please refrain from assuming i'm no longer religious. This also isn't the sub to shit on religion okay guys?  Please keep it civil. ",

        "text": "Toward the end of college I held a part time job with a mortgage broker, right before the real estate crash of 2007. Even though we worked in a large office, my employment was directly for one broker. Well one day, after processing enough subprime mortgage applications, the buyer stopped buying, so we were told to pack up by noon. Mr. Broker told me he's still going the wheel and deal, and that he wanted me to continue working for him out of his home...okay great. Nice home, nice neighborhood, terrible guy; he was amusing, but an ass hat. I remember him calling a printer company demanding they replace his 10 year old printers because they were not compatible with his brand new laptop and operating system. Anyway, this gig was winding down regardless. He paid by check and eventually one bounced. I call him up, and he gets angry saying he can't even remember what we worked on over the last couple weeks (and therefore I shouldn't get paid?) but he'll look into it. A week later, though no word from him, I take the bounced check to his bank and they give me cash. Sweet. \n\nBut no. He tried to burn me, and I know where he lives. He has a 7 series BMW in his garage and a Ford Ranger pick up in the driveway off to the side. It is dark, I'm with a buddy, we walk to his Ranger and realize its unlocked, put it in neutral and roll it directly in front of his garage door, let the air out of all four tires + spare tire, and leave. Take that angry man. \n\nThe kicker: a few years later I get an email from him as part of a marketing blast. Slinging mortgages? Nope. He's emailing his contact list offering to mow their lawns while they watch football (that's his pitch). Not terrible work, but doubt he's paying for a new 7 series with lawn mowing money. ",

As I'm setting the can on the ground and getting ready to put gas in it, two college-age boys walk past, not 5 feet away, smoking cigarettes. I pointed out that this is really dangerous at a gas pump, especially when someone is pumping into a can rather than into the tank, and would they please put out their smokes or move a good distance away. They laughed and told me to mind my fuckin' business. They stroll on and I see them getting into a van with the name of a local Methodist church on it, along with some other youths. I recognize the name of the church, and, sure enough, lo and behold, out of the convenience store comes strolling the Youth Pastor, who went to high school with me, and grew up attending the same Methodist church I did. I hollered, \"Hey, Reggie! How's it going?\" Youth Pastor Reggie comes over and says \"Hi\", and we shoot the breeze for a minute. Then I tell him about the two idiots who walked past smoking and told me to mind my own fucking business. Reggie gets a look on his face like a cloud turning into a thunderstorm. He strides off to the van, and a few minutes later, he comes back with the two idiots. They look like they've had the fear of God put in them. They shamefacedly apologize to me, looking at the ground the whole time. When they're through, Reggie says, \"You guys were smoking in the church van, right? Give me your cigarettes.\" They each hand over an opened pack of ciggies, which Reggie proceeds to field-strip into the garbage can right in front of them. \"No smoking on church outings. Ever. Get back in the van.\" They slouched off and got in the van. I shook Reggie's hand and thanked him. He said, \"No problem. I enjoyed that at least as much as you did. Those two are the biggest assholes in the group, and I loved having a reason to bless them out. Have a good one.\"",

I’m a very light sleeper and I struggle with sleep anyway, at this time I had no methods to help me sleep so I just had to close my eyes and hope for the best.\n\nThis particular night was just before Christmas (maybe Christmas Eve), and I was working retail at the time and had to be up at 6AM for an 8AM start. He knew this and he was going out, I very politely spoke to him and said ‘please do not drunk dial me, I have to be up really early and I’m exhausted, I need my rest’, he said it was no problem at all. So I put my phone on silent and left it next to my bed like normal, at 2AM I heard a buzzing of my phone ringing, I ignore it, phone keeps buzzing so I assume it’s some kind of emergency, he’s drunk, just got home and asks me ‘so how was your night?’ I was fuming, I start having a go at him and explaining that I have to be awake for work in 4 hours and he acts like it was nothing. So I hang up and leave him to it, then in the morning when I wake up the first thing I do is turn of my alarm and start calling him until he picks up. He eventually answered so I ask him how his morning is going, and filled him in on how he drunk dialled me to ask about my night.\n\nHe never drunk dialled me again, even when we split I would receive drunk texts, even emails, but not a single phone call.",

This might get a bit long so TLDR at the end.\n\nSo, I (male, 14) used to go to tutoring every Saturday (yes, horrible), luckily a lot of my friends (male) also went with me so it was not as bad as being alone and not knowing anybody.\n\nThere was this guy, Bob, who wasn't our friend and seemed pretty lonely. So we decided to bring him into our group, he seemed like a pretty nice guy. For the first few lessons it was all fine, we had good chats, got along etc. But, after about 1 month Bob stopped doing any homework and asked us for the answers to it 5 mins before class. We do that sometimes, but Bob was doing it consistently.\n\nAfter a while, Bob stopped respecting us and just expected us to do his homework, give him snacks and not tell the teacher. We had enough at that point and decided to be petty. We didn't want to tell the teacher because he told us his parents were abusive to him and would beat him at any wrong doing. So, we decided to do the most CLASSIC prank on him to teach him a lesson, Toothpaste in an Oreo.\n\nNext class, as usual, he demanded his homework and snacks, so I gave him some \"Oreos\" trying not to laugh the entire time. After about 15 mins into the class, he secretly got out an Oreo (Snacks weren't allowed in class) and took a bite, the reaction was PRICELESS. He seemed like he was going to spew, and the best part was that he couldn't tell the teacher or he would have gotten in trouble and he had to wait 30 mins for the \"Toilet Break\".\n\nBob never bothered or talked to us again.\n\nTLDR: A classmate was very demanding and rude, so I put Toothpaste in Oreos and gave it to him in class.",

        "text": "This was from high school, so a few years ago.\n\nIn my English class, our teacher assigned us a huge project on the Crucible on a Monday and made it due on the Friday of that week. It was worth a lot of points and it was at the beginning of the semester, so it would have a large affect on our grades. For the assignment, each group was given a scene or two and was expected to dissect the scene(s). We would need to annotate the scenes, make a poster board on the signifigance of the scenes, prepare a 10 minute presentation for the poster board, and memorize every line of the scene and act it out in front of the class. Our class had an uneven number of students, so there was one group of 4 while everyone else was in a group of 3.\n\n2 of my friends and I paired up, but our group unfortunately got assigned the 4th person. Our 4th person was this one dude in class who would not do anything during class and get in trouble all the time, so we were not looking forward to working on this. Since we were the biggest group, our teacher also assigned us the most scenes, so we had extra work to do in comparison to everyone else. \n\nWe made plans to meet for an hour or two every day after school, and we made sure that it worked with everyone's schedule. Everyone except this one dude would show up. We would try to get in contact with him so we could all work on the project after school, but he would never respond. We asked him about it in class when we saw him and he said he forgot, but he was working on his lines. Since he kept telling us that he was working on everything, we figured we would hold him to that. At the after school meetings, we only really focused on the parts of the scenes where he didn't have any dialogue, which was about 1/3 of our project. We figured that we could go over the rest of the scenes with him in class before the presentation bc the teacher said she'd give us 20 minutes to prepare and bc it would be hard to practice without him there, so it wasn't really worth our time.\n\nHe texted us back the day the project was due saying (once again) he forgot to meet up with us but he memorized all his lines so he was ready to go, and we were like okay. The three of us had done most of the project and were pretty solid on that, but we never had a chance to practice the 2/3 of our scenes so while we had a general idea of what was being said, we didn't have our lines memorized well and we were not prepared for that part. When we get to class, we go to meet up for our groups and he's not there. We tell the teacher our situation-she said on that Monday that everyone had to present on that Friday, so we would get a 0 on the assignment unless it was an emergency and we did not want to get points taken off of our project for him not doing any work. She tells us to present, ignore his parts in the scene, and not to worry about it. So we turn in our analysis, we do our presentation. When we do the scene, we do the parts without him perfectly but we just give the class a synopsis of the parts he was supposed to be in since none of us expected to memorize his lines. \n\nAt the end of our projects, our teacher hands back the grading rubric for each group and explains to us her grading system for these sorts of projects. Say, as an example, she gives an partner project that is out of 10 points. If a group of two gets 17/20, they have to decide how the points get divided (so the people who did more work can get the more points and make it fair). So if one person did most of the work on the project and the other person did almost nothing, the person who did most of the work could give themselves a 9/10, a 10/10, a 12/10, or even a 16/10 if they truly did most of the work. Everyone in the group was required 1 pity point, so that they would not get a 0, but other than that people could assign the grades how they wanted.\n\nWhen we got our rubrics back, the dude who slacked off had a 1 written next to his name (by the teacher) with a note that said \"pity point, don't change it!\" So we didn't change it. The teacher noticed how much work we all did so she gave us (around) 119/120. Divided between the 4 of us, we had: 1/30, 39/30, 39/30, 40/30 (one girl did a really in-depth analysis when she annotated the scenes so we gave her the extra point). Since it was a huge project at the beginning of the semester, having over 100&amp;#37; really helped my grade in that class.\n\nHe ended up texting us later that afternoon telling us that he didn't show bc he wasn't prepared, but no worries! We'll do the makeup assignment on Monday and he'll be ready then. The ironic thing was, after we told him that we already went bc we had to, he got mad that we didn't sacrifice our grades and wait for him. But that had little affect on any of us since he couldn't really do anything else to sabotage our grade.\n\ntl:dr; guy does 0&amp;#37; of the work for a project, doesn't show for a presentation, teacher gives us over 100&amp;#37; on it and gives him a pity point",

        "text": "TL;DR at the end\n\nI was reminded by a post in r/prorevenge about someone with noisy music neighbors about my experience living in a house in Arizona. I don’t think I’d qualify this as pro revenge but \nThis was 15 years ago I and four other people I worked with lived in the same house in chandler, a town on the south side of the Phoenix metro. On the other side of our back fence was Indian reservation (desert as far as the eye could see, typical Arizona fare saguaros and scrub bush, basically Satan’s butthole, but twice as hot) our nearest neighbor was about 50 yards away. Everyone in our house worked in a restaurant together and were all in our mid 20’s, this was the party house. So it’s not exactly like we were saints of neighbors. But we kept our music at a tolerable level I think. \n\nBeing as we were partiers the neighbors who played deafening death metal at all hours(mind you I said it was a good 50 yards away and we could still hear it outside plain as day, I think they had giant concert speakers, I always pictured Marty in back to the future. Giant ass speakers) the music never really bothered us unless it was super late at night or early in the morning. Just a minor annoyance. \n\nThere was a menagerie of comers and goers from this house at all hours and times. Always obvious tweekers(methheads) skinny, awful skin, summer teeth(summer here summer there) just really awful scabs of humanity. We all knew what was going on there, as long as the house didn’t stink or blow up we just ignored it. \nBut always the death metal. Random times, for at least an hour on a stint. Gwar, obituary, cannibal corpse, napalm death. Like I said, it didn’t generally bother us. We left them alone they left us alone. \n\nExcept once. \n\none night we’re having a big Lebowski fest at our house. Everyone dresses up like the dude or Walter, we drink copious amounts of caucasians(White Russians), quote movie lines and watch the movie together. We’d spent most of the cool fall day (a rarity in hell’s asshole...but it’s a dry heat, yeah) setting it up. Outdoor theater screen, speakers, bar, my friend had even set up a zip line and white sheets so some girls would give it a go like Maude in the movie(nude)hopefully(one lady eventually did, it was glorious). This was sadly pre camera phones. \n\nAbout an hour after the sun goes down, people are starting to arrive, myself dressed as a pinky toe, my girlfriend dressed as an eagles tape. The death metal starts up...fuck. It seems louder than usual simply because we were supposed to be the ones making the noise outside. \n\nSo my roommates dressed as the dude and Walter went on a mission, they thought they could kill the power at the neighbors and save the party. Fueled with liquid courage, off they go. Jump the fence, throw the main power switch. the music stops, everyone cheers... roommates get back without having been spotted. Mission successful. we have a great party including nude zip line painting(again, glorious!). We never gave the tweekers a second thought. \n\nThree days later a tweeker I swear I’ve never seen knocks on our door. He’s standing in the doorway picking off invisible ants and asks if we’ve seen anyone creeping around his house. I shoot a look to my girlfriend and we both do the “holy shit” look of sudden memory. No one ever turned their power back on. The tweeker explains the power is out but the power company swears there’s no outage. We tell him we’ve got no idea and he stumbles home. \n\nI wasn’t going over that fence and most of my roommates had gone for a long weekend in Mexico. So another three days later when everyone is home we get a plan together. My personal plan was, “they’ll eventually figure it out, don’t turn it back on” \nBut my roommates are feeling guilty. I guess I’m the asshole. \n\nfueled with liquid courage once again a different roommate this time, jumps the fence, very late at night. (like time matters to methheads) in order to insure they were asleep(this was our thought process). Must have been 3-4am. dressed in all black like a ninja. He throws the switch back on. \n\nDeath metal like nothing ever happened. Started right back up without skipping a beat. Lights blazing, metal screaming it must have scared the literal shit out of whoever was in there. Three people ran outside like there was a fire. My roommate is now trapped in their back yard he didn’t have to worry about noise obviously but there was suddenly a lot of light. He hops the fence into the desert beyond and two tweekers who spot him give chase. He got away but returned to our house covered in scrapes, cactus needles and bruises an hour later. \nWe’re all laughing our asses off. Problem solved. \n\nMy girlfriend went out of her way a few weeks later to speak with the guy who came to our door. Sort of do a check in and see if they know. \nShe asked him about the power, saying she noticed it was back on. \nHe told her that the police had turned it off as a punishment for the loud music(wha?!!) and if it happens again(the loud music) they(the police)would turn off the power for 30 days not just a week. (We’ve no idea where they came up with this info beyond drugs)\nI lived in that house two more years and I never heard death metal again. \n\nTL;DR: druggy neighbors almost ruined our party with super loud death metal. We shut off their power, and our party was saved. We finally got their power back on 6 days later. Tweekers were somehow convinced that is was a punishment from the police. They never did it again.

        "text": "On mobile, apologies. Throwaway account, obviously.\n\nWhen I was younger, I worked at an amusement park as a supervisor, one of the rides I supervised was an older wooden roller coaster.\n\nOne Saturday, late in the season, the grounds department was draining the irrigation system and had contacted me and asked me to turn off the valve if any of the coaster riders were getting wet. They were getting soaked as the lines were being blown out, so I turned it off.\n\nQueue a happenstance sighting of a person from high school. A person who was a judgmental Mormon prude who chastised me multiple times in high school for wearing clothing “too provocative” for high school.\n\nShe and her new boyfriend/husband headed straight for the roller coaster queue. I hatched a plan. I ran under the station and turned the water valve back on.\n\nI relieved one of my employees and told him to go on break. When my former schoolmate boarded the coaster train, they were seated near the back, perfect.\n\nAfter securing the passengers, my crew and I dispatched the train. Two minutes later, as it returned to the station, I stopped it manually in the reduction brake run. I then proceeded to manually advance the train until my former classmate and her male seat mate were both in the path of the draining sprinkler.\n\nThis ride had an unusual problem at the time, if anyone pushed ‘Emergency Stop’ twice, the ride required a maintenance supervisor keyed restart to clear the stop. Of course, guess which button I pushed twice then.\n\nI alerted maintenance to the issue. A few minute later, the rest of the ride crew returned from break. I texted the only maintenance technician on duty to take his time, letting him in on my scheme.\n\nFifteen minutes later, the stop was cleared and I’m standing at the exit ramp taking pictures. Pretty sure even then she didn’t realize I got petty revenge. I’d filled out quite a bit, most people from high school didn’t recognize me by then.\n\nNice wet t-shirt contest, prude!",

        "text": "tl;dr - if you really want to be in front of another car, remember that they are now behind you and there is very little you can do to change that.\n\nSo, I'm driving home, at the very tail-end of rush hour. I'm driving down a 4-lane road, separated by a high median in the middle, and high guard rails down the side. Usually, at this time of night, this particular road is clear - though it's notoriously bad during the height of rush hour. Tonight, it's backed up because they closed the left lane. Now, I'm not an aggressive driver, but I am an assertive one - I know how to merge in that you actually have to keep moving, and if you stop, you'll never actually be able to complete the merge. As traffic approaches the lane closure, it's a functioning and clean zipper merge. Everyone is being quite civilized. That is, until the Volvo next to me decides that being one extra car length ahead will make all the difference in the world in his commute time. I still try to complete the merge, and he is having none of it. He lays on his horn, flips me off, and comes within inches of taking paint off my car. I acquiesce, and he ends up in front of me... In a single lane of traffic. It's twilight, and the road is well maintained and protected. Inspiration strikes me. I'm I a small truck, and he is in a sedan; I flip on my high beams. Now, the plan was to flip them back off after a second or two, until he began gesticulating his best guess of my genital size and brake checking me (again, assertive, not aggressive; I always maintain the 3-second rule). Now, it's on. Literally. It's twilight, so I know I won't completely blind him, so I leave my high beams on. Mr. Volvo now gets to spend the next two miles driving down a single lane of traffic, moving at a snails pace, with no chance to turn off. He is not thrilled to say the least, but hey, play stupid games, win stupid prizes. When the lane closure finally ends, it's right at the off-ramp Mr. Volvo is taking. He flips me off as a goodbye, and a cheerily wave goodbye to him. I like to think he learned a lesson, but I suspect he didn't. ",
