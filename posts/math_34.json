        "text": "I'm just an undergrad, but I'm confused on how PhD theses work. For example, a professor of mine just submitted a publication of his from his third year of graduate. The only changes that were made was a page was added with the whole \"submitted to the department of mathematics in partial fulfillment\" and so on.\n\nHowever, this doesn't seem to be the case in general. I rarely see PhD candidates submitting a paper of theirs as their thesis. The paper he had submitted was one solving a major open problem in his field, so I figured this must be the reason it's an exception. I also watched an interview of Jim Simons and I get the impression that he did the same -- solve an open problem that people care about and then just call his paper his thesis.\n\nBut I get the impression that, in general, the results in a PhD theses aren't necessarily super significant, just novel. If that's the case, that results don't have to be significant, why isn't it more common for PhD candidates to just call their favorite (or only) paper their thesis? What's the expectation for a thesis?",

However, I've been asking myself these questions for a while:\n\n- Why are those above the only \"classes of functions\" considered \"elementary\"?\n- What if one expresses a non-elementary integral in terms of an infinite sum, instead of a finite one (since they can't be expressed in terms of finite sums)? \n- Is there a method to find that an integral is non-elementary?\n- Are non-elementary integrals studied by some particular theory?\n\nI'm sorry if this question is kind of naive, and I will cancel the post if it's not relevant.",

        "text": "sorry if this comes out a little rant-y, this is a question that's been bothering me for some time and I'm honestly a little scared to find out the answer.\n\ntldr; my degree is not going well, in any aspect, but I'm too stubborn to stop. what should I expect?\n\nI'll start by saying, I absolutely love mathematics. ever since I was young my math teachers noticed my curiosity and helped me advance ahead of the class. throughout middle school, I spent basically every day by going to school until noon, then coming back home and studying math on my own until the evening. during high school I kept studying independently, and started getting into more serious mathematics. especially proof based mathematics, which made me love it more than ever. I still spend a significant amount of my free time doing math. I enjoy reading books and lecture notes I find online, literally just to learn. no other goal besides enjoying the process. so I hope I get to keep doing that.\n\nmy point is, I'm extremely passionate towards math, and can't imagine my life without it. I know I'll keep studying it in whatever way I can, for a very long time, no matter what happens.\n\nbut I'm concerned... I started taking some classes in the university a few years ago. I'm enjoying it a lot, the problem is I'm not very good at it. my pace is very slow; people who started their degree at the same time as me are close to finishing already, while I'm \"stuck\" in relatively introductory \"1st year\" classes. and even that, with quite bad grades. the first time I took calculus 1 I got the lowest marks out of 200+ students. that was so devastating, and I had to take a break after that which slowed my pace even more. luckily I was able to recover and retake the class, and at last pass it (still not with a spectacular grade). most other courses I did so far, they didn't go as bad. but not great either...\n\ngrades aren't even the only problem. I don't really know anyone else there, so I'm sort of a lone wolf in this sense. other students are able to form their own social groups, or maybe they have friends there from before? so they can study together and help each other out, I think this is certainly a disadvantage on my end. I also don't have any form of networking with the professors or TAs whatsoever. I live far from the university (2-3 hours in each direction depending on the day) so I can't \"just hop over\" to office hours or things like that. usually I can barely even stay after lectures, because I need to hurry for trains.\n\ncompared to other students, I just feel like I straight out suck. I spend so much time studying and working hard for tenth the outcome. I have a lot of passion and will power to keep going, at least for now. I'm just worried it will run out eventually. I'm worried the academic setting would keep throwing at me pressure and disappointment until it's too much.\n\nI'm not sure about my plans for the future, or about higher degrees and whatever else the university has to offer. for now I think I'll keep taking courses, progressing slowly in my own pace. maybe some time in a few years I will get to do research, which I'd absolutely love, but I don't know if this will even be possible.\n\ndo I have any chance of succeeding as a mathematician? if the current trend continues, what will happen? do I need very high grades? what would happen to me if I can't keep up?",

Since the formatting is better on stack exchange, I'd advise glancing at the definitions/setup there, but I have a more \"discussion oriented\" version of this question for Reddit.\n\nWhy, in general, is it that linear approximations are so prominent in applied mathematics (I've seen them used for numerical analysis a great deal, for analyzing dynamical systems -- and especially stationary points, in statistics for sensitivity analysis, and on and on) but the very natural generalization to additive models is largely unheard of?\n\nObviously some applications require full linearity. For instance, numerical analysis needs to be computationally efficient and much of the benefit of linear approximation would be lost in this generalization. But there are others (like sensitivity analysis) where Additivity does seem like the \"right\" condition to me.",

        "text": "Im not a mathematician, but this idea came to me and Im wondering where one would rebut it. Computing nunbers this way is inherently unscalable in a computer science context, but technically possible with infinite time as its deterministic, I do believe. The idea in a nutshell, is imagining a computer tied to reality itself, and each time it counts, it multithreads itself to count itself in another dimension of time, creating expontentially more threads each iteration. Possible to do by all means, even with pen and paper, if you accept you just wont get super far before it becomes exhausting.\n\nTheres four rules:\n\n1) We start at 0.\n\n2) We increment by a unit, the initial unit value being 1. We then move to Step 3.\n\n3) Each time we increment by one, we spawn another \"thread\" (or independent set of instructions to operate recursively) and we will divide by 10 and begin counting again, same rule applies again as in Rule 2.\n\n4) Once all steps are completed, we do it again for the negative and imaginary numbers (This only increases computation 4x, and for the sake of the argument i will skip this)\n\nSo heres what the sequence would look like (excluding negative and imaginary, for convenience). I will also separate it into lines for easier visualization of whats going on.\n\n0, \n\n1, 0.1, \n\n2, 0.2, 1.1, 0.11,\n\n3, 0.3, 1.2, 0.12, 2.1, 0.21, 1.11, 0.111,\n\nAs you see each step seems to multiply the number of substeps by 2, quickly this blows up to something unreasonable to calculate.\n\nBut as far as I can see, it looks like I will eventually hit \"every number\", its just that it might not be physically possible to get very far.

Someone said I needed to go through Cal-3 with many other courses to understand this, though I have a decent conceptual understanding. \n\nYou have a Gaussian distribution with a random number outcome; once the outcome occurs, you plot it on the chart, move the Gaussian distribution to zero on the previous outcome, and wait for another random occurrence within the Gaussian distribution. If this is repeated enough times, you will get a zig-zag motion with occurrences taking place within the given volatility range (I think). Most occurrences take place without deviating too far from zero. However, occasionally you get some big volatility days back to back within the randomness, showcased by the bigger moves on the chart. Not exactly sure how this works, but you also have a \"drift rate\" meaning the randomness has the tendency to go up and to the right over time. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o95jlgm27kda1.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=45956c310a611b52aadae3a351f5a10f012e85d7",
