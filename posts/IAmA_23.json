        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9gclqa/i_am_a_college_paperwriter_from_boston_with_10/",
        "text": "I'm a writer-for-hire from Boston, and I work for busy degree candidates.\n\nI save people a lot of TIME in their degree programs for Nursing, Business Administration, and Education. To check out my brand, you can search for: Doctor-My-Document of Boston\n\n I’m doing an AMA because I want to connect with awesome redditor-freelancers interested in getting involved with paper-writing service or Online Class Help. I have a lot of useful ideas to share with anyone trying to make a living as a writer-for-hire. \n\n1. **Nursing Research and Online Class Help:** Almost half of my clients are nursing students who need help with nursing papers in APA style. I hire great writers to help with NURSING - LPN degree through doctoral degrees. We write research proposals for Quality Improvement, Action Research, Community Health Nursing Initiatives, Culturally Sensitive Educational Interventions, and a whole lot more. We always cite high-quality sources, like articles in professional medical and nursing journals. The writers who work with me to offer nursing paper help have subscriptions to databases full of the most recent articles in the publication that need to be cited in any postgraduate or professional paper. Nursing paper writing service is in higher demand than any other type of paper writing service I offer.\n2. **Masters of Education:** You can be the most inspired teacher in the world, and that still doesn’t make it any easier to get through grad school. The worst part is using APA style citations and reference lists, because there is literally a whole book of rules to follow. It seems absurd that every degree candidate has to follow a whole book full of rules about how to write with APA style. And then after that, degree candidates have to learn research methodology. It’s a HUGE amount of information, trying to compare all the various quantitative and qualitative methods, and figure out how they can contribute to their professional fields. If you’re a great writer and you don’t mind using APA style, I need your help with research and writing for my clients who are completing their degrees in Education. Many are at the undergraduate level, but most of them are completing postgraduate research.\n3. **Masters of Business Administration:** Entrepreneurship, Accounting, Human Resource Management, Strategic Planning, Technology – a lot of people are completing Business Administration degrees because it’s required by their jobs, and they need help from talented writers. It’s company policy, so they are trying to do online classes while they also work 60+ hours at their competitive jobs.\n\nThose are the areas where I do the most work: nursing research (i.e. for nursing students, LPN-DNP), Business Administration (MBA), and Masters of Education.  \n\n**How much to charge?**\n\nI ask clients to pay $119 per 1000 words for undergraduate level writing and $129 per 1,000 words for graduate level.  With double-spaced APA style, 1,000 words = about 3-4 pages.  \n\n* For a short paper, I'll ask clients to pay $69 for 550 words.  \n* A five-page paper costs $179.\n* If someone needs a 20+ page dissertation proposal, s/he can pay $129/week for six weeks. \n* Clients who need Online Class Help can pay a flat weekly rate.  \n\nPeople in any of the degree programs I mention above need papers written in APA style (6th edition) with citations/references to professional journal articles (APA citations/references). I help with article critiques, systematic reviews, research proposals, PICO(T) papers for nurses, lesson plans for teachers, SWOT analysis for business, and almost anything else you can think of.\n\n**It’s hard to win a rat race when you have to keep stopping to do homework.** College is great for kids who still live at home, but for busy professionals it’s just a lot of work. College paper writing service &amp; Online Class Help are really controversial, because so many people think it’s not ethical to get help writing a paper.\n\nFor those of us who want to write for a living, it’s worthwhile to at least consider the idea to work for someone who needs help writing a paper. Some people say degree candidates should all learn APA and research methodology without any help. Many people on reddit probably did exactly that. Your school might have a policy where you can only get help from your adviser. Secretly, you might have gotten some help from a spouse or friend, too. Well, getting that kind of help is the basis for a whole industry now. \n\n**It’s totally understandable when people say degree candidates should do all their work themselves.** But it’s just more complicated than that, with for-profit colleges, language barriers, exploitative recruiting, and… well, a degree is an expensive and complicated commodity. A common for a person to need help writing a paper.\n\nFor those of you who don’t approve of Academic Writing work, please take it easy on me. Language barriers, time constraints, and other factors really do create situations where you would say, “YES, I see why that person would hire a writer for help with a class.” The Online Class Help industry is not great, but it’s not the worst thing in the world either. We are not the ones who undermined American higher education. It has already been undermined by the profit motive before we got here.  \n\n[PROOF: Please scroll down slightly and find the image with me holding a paper with today’s date &amp; my username.](http://doctormydocument.com/) (Look for the kitten).\n\nOther stuff: \n\nMost of my clients are completing one of the following types of degrees:\n\nBachelor of Education (B.Ed.)\n\nMaster of Education (M.Ed.)\n\nBachelor's degree in Business Administration (BBA)\n\nMasters of Business Administration (MBA)\n\nMaster of Science in Nursing (MSN)\n\nBachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN)\n\nA lot of them go on to get their PhD degrees, so they hire me for help writing their dissertations. \n\nFor anyone interested in writing APA papers for Business, Education, &amp; Nursing classes: These papers require a ton of research to find out all the trending concepts, and write about them for your class. After ten years in these new industries -- “Online Class Help” and “Academic Writing” – I developed a specialization in those three areas I mentioned – people who in Nursing School, people completing their MBA degrees (Business Administration), &amp; or people completing their Masters of Education. From degree candidates studying who need nursing paper help, papers for their MBA/Business Administration, or a research proposal for their Masters of Education, there is a lot of demand for professional paper-writers.",

I'm 37yo and 3 years ago i quit my IT job in Australia and started travelling solo on my motorcycle.\nI haven't stop since.\nI spent a year roughly, going all around Australia and then i shipped my motorcycle to South America and started riding up from there. \nI recently reached Alaska and came back to Vancouver, so now i'm planning my route towards Europe and across Asia to reach Australia again, to complete my round the world trip.\nI post one picture a day. \nAll my pictures are taken with my cellphone but I carry a drone as well.\n\nI've also been sponsored by some brands that sell motorcycle gear and equipment.\nI do NOT get paid to travel and i've been sustaining myself just with my savings, accumulated with few years of work.\n\nBefore I left for this trip, I always wondered how people that did these kind of things (travelling for long periods of time) were actually able to do it. \nSo, here i am, hopefully answering some question and making myself useful in this sense for others that may have the same questions i had, before i started my journey.\n\nAmA!\n\nRiding with: KTM 1190 adventure  2014 model.\n\nSocial media\nIg: www.instagram.com/paolocattaneophoto \n\nFb: www.facebook.com/paolocattaneoofficial\n\nYt: www.youtube.com/paolocattaneo\n\n\nProof: https://www.reddit.com/user/paolo_0/comments/9g4cmq/proof/?utm_source=reddit-android\n\n\nEDIT: OMG! you guys are amazing! Thanks for all the nice questions. I'll try to answer to all of you. Some of them are redundant so if i don't answer is because there's already something similar out there.\n\nEDIT 2: I'm overwhelmed by all the interesting questions and nice words i ve received. Going to bed now. I ll come back tomorrow to answer some more! THANK YOU ALL!\n\nEDIT 3: I'm still trying to answer all of the questions. I ll take a break now but continue on tonight. THANKS A LOT FOR ALL YOUR ENQUIRIES! Over a 1000 ! Doing my best to reply to all of you. \n\nEDIT 4: OK!!!!  THAT'S IT FOR NOW! Thank you soooooo much for all the questions and the beautiful words of encouragement and support. It s truly remarkable to see how many people would want to travel and explore our fabulous planet.\nAlso thanks to all the haters that took time to stop and say hi and ask irrelevant or silly questions. You make the internet the most interesting place ever and you are confirming us, with your unnecessary behaviour, that we are doing the right thing.\n\nHopefully i ll meet some of you on the road and make sure you follow my instagram to see where I am at.\nDrop me a line if you see me passing through. Happy to share few stories and a chat.\n\nCheers!!",

Growing up with a mountain guide father, my talent and passion led me as a teenager to the top of climbing competitions and cutting-edge outdoor routes. In 2000, on a climbing expedition in Kyrgyzstan, my partners and I were captured and held hostage by armed rebels. Miraculously, after six days of captivity, our group managed to free ourselves. Upon returning to the United States and trying to piece together my life, I severed my index finger in a home remodeling accident. Managing to overcome the obstacles life was throwing at me, I came back stronger. My free climbing accomplishments in Yosemite National Park remain unmatched and made my one of the best rock climbers in the world, a perfect contender to be the first person to free climb The Dawn Wall.\n \nKevin: Like most kids, I grew up climbing ladders, trees and fences, until a visit to my local climbing gym changed my life forever. I steadily improved my climbing and started winning youth national championships. Once I discovered bouldering, I quickly made a name for myself as one of the sport’s best. At my home stomping grounds in the California’s Buttermilks, I made the first ascent of the terrifying Ambrosia, a 15-meter high boulder from which a fall near the top would be catastrophic. While searching to expand into other climbing disciplines, I learned about Tommy Caldwell’s initial forays on the Dawn Wall. Under the mentorship of Tommy, I proved a quick study as I transformed myself into a big wall climber capable of the completing the most continuously difficult route in the world.\n\nProof: \n\nhttps://twitter.com/tommycaldwell1/status/1039878083048865792\n \nhttps://twitter.com/kjorgeson/status/1039877895655772160'",
