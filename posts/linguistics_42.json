        "text": "Do you have a quick question about language or linguistics that doesn’t merit its own thread? Our weekly Q&amp;A thread is the perfect place to post them! A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.\n\n**What counts as a “quick question”?**\n\nAny question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: \n\n*Quick questions:*\n\n* Asking for an explanation of a technical term\n* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature\n* Asking how we would transcribe something\n* Asking how a feature works in a particular language\n\n*Not-so-quick questions:*\n\n* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim\n* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject\n\nIf you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first. You may also be interested in our [**reading list**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/readinglist).\n\n**Commenting rules**\n\nThe rules for commenting in this post are the same as for the rest of /r/linguistics. You don’t have to be a flaired user to answer questions, but we expect answers to reflect an expert level of knowledge. Please familiarize yourself with [**our commenting policy**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1u9xsr/reminder_of_the_rlinguistics_commenting_policy/) and [**our subreddit rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/rules).\n\n**What if I didn't get an answer to my question last week?**\n\nYour question probably wasn’t answered because no one who knew the answer saw it. This could be because you posted it soon before the new Q&amp;A thread went up, or it could be because it the answer requires specialist knowledge.  If this happens, feel free to repost your question in the new Q&amp;A thread, or to post it as a separate thread.",

I asked my prof about it earlier this year but didn't get too much info on it just because I asked after class. \n\nWhen I was watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccfGq4Mqbjo&amp;t=1248s) video (Simon Schaffer is from Southampton) I noticed that in his accent (and I've noticed it when listening to Cockney too),  \\[ə\\] sounds like it's pronounced closer to \\[ʌ\\].  As an example, words like \"butter\" \"under\" or \"ultimately\" sound as if they're pronounced with the same vowel sound rather than having a distinction between stressed \\[ʌ\\] and reduced \\[ə\\].  I'm not sure if this is down to not knowing enough, if there are some accents that substitute similar vowel sounds in for \\[ə\\], or if it just comes down to specific fine-grain differences in certain phonemes that end up getting lumped together in IPA?

        "text": "I often see claims that abjads are more suited for languages with consonantal roots, such as Arabic. I've never understood this though and can't remember seeing any actual evidence for this. To me it seems like having a consonantal root system leads to systematic ambiguity that is in general harder to resolve through context than without the roots. I recently got into a debate about this on r/conlangs, and this was basically my argument:\n\nTake two pairs of homographs in English: \"lead\" and \"read\". The first one can be an noun or a verb, while the second can be two verb forms of the same lexeme. Which one would cause the most confusion in writing? I can't think of any situation where \"lead\" could be misinterpreted, but plenty for \"read\".\n\nThe point is that two word-forms of the same lexeme are in general more easily confused when homographic than two word-forms of different lexemes. For both kinds things like agreement and syntax might resolve the ambiguity, but when the forms are of different lexemes there's also a large chance that one of them are inappropriate in the context, e.g. when on a boat you might hear \"I saw some fish\" but likely not \"I saw some wool\". In consonantal root systems the vowels carry more grammatical meaning, and consonants more lexical (slight simplification ofc). Therefore, the \"read\" kind of ambiguity is exactly the kind you get in abjads with consonantal roots.\n\n---------------\n\nSo has there been any research about this? How valid is my argument? I feel like there has to be something given how often I see this claim around. The Arabic writing system obviously works but I don't see why the roots would be one of the reasons why.",

If I am able to pronounce, say, a uvular stop and a uvular trill, is it inherently easier for me to pronounce a uvular fricative? If I know how to pronounce all dental sounds, is it easier to learn alveolar sounds, etc?\n\nThis question is inspired by my boyfriend, who is natively fluent in both Armenian (which has a moderately large sound system, specifically in reference to consonants) and English. Does he have an advantage, say, compared to me (native English, B1/B2 proficiency in Spanish) in pronouncing new sounds presented by an L3 since he intuitively knows how to pronounce more sounds in more areas of the mouth?\n\nHope this isn’t too rambly/unclear.

The dictionary has half a million (technical terms no one knows.)\n\n---------------------\n\nAdditionally: Is there work done on relative displacement of vocabulary? French seems to have a denser/richer vocabulary related to interpersonal relations/emotions (so many idioms!) (compared to English, German and Russian in my experience.) The emphasis of English vocabulary seems to relate to \"comparisons\" (as I've never encountered any work on this stuff I have no idea how to describe it) like slangy or grand/Miltonic expressions for how great/horrible something was (kicked ass! ... doom &lt;- somehow they seem in the same generic field to me but of course other languages have these too, it just seems to be not as much), Russian seems densest in these little daily-existence words (not like house work but... быт, бытие etc.) which code a lot of extra aspects English would need extra adjectives to clarify. Perhaps these are just due to densities of idiom in modern usage - English has many terms describing the sounds in nature, but I'm more familiar with the German rauschen, knistern, rascheln, brausen than whooshing.",

I deal with Hun-Roman relations so everything is Latin and Greek for me really. I can pretty easily explain that the Huns were not Turks despite speaking a dialect of the language family we call Turkic, but I've never been able to find the solid rebuttals for all their weird linguistic arguments (despite the fact I know they're bunk) barring the stuff that deals with Greek.\n\nBasically, I'd appreciate it if you all could help me out with being able to just shut down these people and their absurd Sumerian-were-Turks and everything-else-were-Turks theories and the like.\n\n(Just an aside, the steppe nomads are always in a really weird spot with this because in many respects the Pan-Turanists technically aren't wrong, but are far from being right either, because virtually every steppe society was a melting pot which likely included *some* proto-Turkic or other Altaic language family speakers.

Or who doesn't consider them to have been, in the early stages, one single dialectal cluster that later developed into two sister languages?\n\nI ask this because elsewhere I'm having a discussion with one who says Occitan is Gallo Romance but Catalan isn't. And gives as a source Jules Gilliéron, who died 92 years ago.\n\nI mean, we can discuss if Catalan and Occitan are both Gallo Romance or Ibero Romance, but I don't think there's room to discuss one being Ibero Romance and the other one Gallo Romance (if we are talking linguistics, not politics, of course).\n\nEdit:\n\nIn a Wikipedia article it is written:\n\n&gt; The inclusion of Catalan in Gallo-Romance is disputed by some linguists who prefer to group it with Iberian Romance, since although Old Catalan is close to Old Occitan, **it later adjusted its lexicon to some degree to align with Spanish.** In general however, modern Catalan, especially grammatically, remains closer to modern Occitan than to either Spanish or Portuguese, however.\n\nIsn't this as nonsense as saying English is Romance, due to \"later adjusting its lexicon to some degree to align with French\"?",

        "text": "This seems to be a common motif in the descriptions of Balto\\-Slavic languages and reconstructions. Nobody really speaks of underlying tone (well, Morris Halle might have, IIRC), but giving it another name (accentual power, etc.) doesn't really change anything. After all, it influences stress placement in the ways that you'd expect tone to do. For instance, old Lithuanian is assumed to have borne stress on the first H\\-syllable. Allegedly, modern Lithuanian bears it on the *last* H alike. A couple of rules may move it afterwards, but that's likely irrelevant. And, of course, these L's and H's are purely underlying.\n\nAlso, to make it clear, this is definitely not the Balto\\-Slavic acute/circumflex that I'm describing here, it's Paul Garde's *force accentuelle* and equivalent concepts. The acute/circumflex one still surfaces reliably in many dialects.\n\nI would be highly interested in any typological parallels. Thanks!",

A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.\n\n**What counts as a “quick question”?**\n\nAny question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: \n\n*Quick questions:*\n\n* Asking for an explanation of a technical term\n* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature\n* Asking how we would transcribe something\n* Asking how a feature works in a particular language\n\n*Not-so-quick questions:*\n\n* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim\n* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject\n\nIf you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first.

This could be because you posted it soon before the new Q&amp;A thread went up, or it could be because it the answer requires specialist knowledge.  If this happens, feel free to repost your question in the new Q&amp;A thread, or to post it as a separate thread.",
