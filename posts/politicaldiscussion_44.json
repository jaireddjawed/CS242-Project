        "text": "9/11 changed a lot of America’s views. Specifically how much money they were willing to spend on the military. While Bush took office, the military spending increased quite a bit. By the end of Bush’s time in office, military spending increased by 200%. Obama’s military spending only increased because of his action in the wars started by American when Bush was in office. This peaked around 2010 at well over 700 billion spent and close to that in 2011. But that year marked the ending of the Iraq war and the Afghanistan war really winded down throughout Obama’s time. Then Obama’s started to cut military spending. The Republicans didn’t like that and Trump is bringing it back to to war grade spending with his 680+ billion dollar 2019 projection. The US’s military spending has been extremely volatile so it’s hard to have a set opinion. What in your eyes is a good military spending budget? Is it more than a budget? (I am extremely unqualified to give any good advice but...) Personally, after these wars, I think we should re-evaluate where our money is spent. For example, 28 billion dollars could give all military personnel a 20k raise. Maybe we don’t need so many new jets. Etc. etc.   \n   \n  \n  \nEdit: on I feel that I need to explain my explanation a bit. I’m not saying that Obama’s was the reason the wars ended or bush was the reason they cost so much or whatever. It was simply a timeline. Didn’t think you guys would get so riled about it. Sorry. Edited my post a bit.",

Immigration reform seems to be co-opted by hardliners both in the Trump administration (see Stephen Miller), and the Trump base, which don't want DACA or any other changes beyond tougher border security and limiting even legal immigration.\n\nWill this hurt Republicans in the long run? Will the party be able to rebrand to appeal to minorities, especially Hispanics, as suggested by their 2012 post-mortem and shake off the Trump effect?",
