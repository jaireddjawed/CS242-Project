I started rucking a few weeks back and decided to start running. I ran a mile the other day and it about killed me, since I haven\u2019t ran since high school, and got bad shin splints. I read some advice to jog slowly starting out, so after waiting a few days for healing, I ran a 5k course, pace of 12 for the first mile and 14 something for the last two, and could have kept going if my knee wasn\u2019t hurting so bad. I don\u2019t think I had ever \u201cran\u201d that far in my life, it was interesting that jogging slowly made it happen. \nSince I can already jog a 5k, I was wondering if there is a plan to take your 5k time from old man slow to at least an average time for my age (30 minutes ish), and then down to a respectable time? It seems that all the plans start out way slower, I can walk on an incline with 30lbs on my back for an hour easily, just can\u2019t run fast without lots of pain. Thoughts?

I moved to exclusively cycling for the next couple years. Once the pandemic hit, my mental health exponentially worsened, which, without going into much detail, resulted in developing chronic pain alongside pelvic floor dysfunction. My self esteem took a hit, my health anxiety heightened, my fear of injuring myself further led to me ceasing exercise, and all this accumulated in hitting a low point in my life. It\u2019s worth noting I have ADHD (resulting in hypersensitivity and being easily overwhelmed), PTSD (resulting in body dysmorphia and overall low sense of worth), and OCD (manifesting as health anxiety). \n\nI had a breakthrough the other day realizing that my fear of injuring myself has created this vicious feedback loop worsening my mental and physical health. Prior to the pandemic I never associated exercise as a means of meditation and release\u2013it had always been the fulcrum of body dysmorphia stemming from PTSD. However, I believe the aforementioned details resulted in me getting little to no dopamine, endorphins, or any other feel good chemicals, and thus the development of my chronic pain and muscle tension. \n\nI want to change this. I want to get back into running. I want to regain control of my health. \n\nThe problem is, for years all I did was run, I never strength trained. My physical therapist believes my pelvic floor dysfunction and chronic pain are the result of a tight\/weak core and posterior chain, especially in my glutes. The reason for my neglecting strength training? Being easily overwhelmed by all the possibilities and exercises. \n\nUltimately, I came here to ask for advice, as well as this question:\n\nDoes anyone have any basic strength training regimens that can be done at home?\n\nI have access to dumbbells, a bench, and a kettlebell.\n\nWhenever I\u2019ve asked this in the past I\u2019m pointed towards various wikis and websites that list an overwhelming amount of detail, and I figure it is best to start small to work up consistency in my routine.    \n\nThank you for your help!","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678480859.0},{"title":"Apps for treadmill C25K?","author":"dickewand","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/C25K\/comments\/11nmb9a\/apps_for_treadmill_c25k\/","text":"Is doing C25K on a treadmill any different than outside?

Since I live in Seattle (cold and rainy for a lot of the year) and I often can only work out once kids are in bed, I've followed the program on our treadmill.  \n\nThe good news is that I was able to go from having never run before in my life for more than 2 min to being able to jog at 5.5 MPH for an hour and I'm aiming to run a 10K this summer (I'm not looking to be able to place high or have a fast pace, just be able to jog the whole 10K without stopping).  I \\*never\\* thought I would get this far.  \n\nThe bad news is that literally all of my jogging has been somewhat artificial, on a treadmill at a fixed speed, no incline, on a forgiving platform much less hard than concrete, at a nice temperature with no rain, and usually watching netflix.  That 10K I've set as a goal is going to be much different as it will be outside and have all the differences that come with it.  As I've lurked on this subreddit I've seen many people say that running on a treadmill is much different than running outside and that totally makes sense.\n\nSo my ask to the more experienced folks here is: How should I prepare for a 10K race if I've only run on a treadmill so far?  As the weather gets better, I can probably get outside for at least one run per week.  Any suggestions on the best thing to do?  Should I ease into things (distance-wise? speed-wise?) to avoid injuries?  I'm looking both for suggestions of things to do\/not do as well as things to watch out for or expect in transition.  To be honest, I got into this mostly just to be able to stay fit and so I'm fine keeping it on the treadmill in the long term, but I'd like to be able to run outside in events and when I travel, etc. and I don't want to be naive and assume I can just go out and do the same things I'd been able to do inside.

So I did, and every 2-3 days I did another C25k day. Taking it slow really helped, I didn't have to repeat a day, I didn't not complete a day either. I have juggled this around childcare (on school days I run mid morning after drop off, on holidays I run early doors before people are awake.

I've run in snow (discovered that you can run safely on a field where you won't slip!) I've purchased hi viz clothing and lights so I can run in dark evenings or mornings, and I've learnt to be more strict on managing my workload and ensuring my run days are adhered too (OK I work for myself which helps as I'm a kind boss and allow myself time during the 9-5 to run \ud83d\ude02) and I've even run with a head cold (turned out that made me feel much better than a lemsip would've!) \n\nI'm glad I pushed myself to run outside instead of buying a treadmill. We don't really have space, I didn't want to spend the money (more previously used excuses not to run) but I've been amazed at how much it helps mentally to get outside! I've learned to ignore my thoughts on what people might be thinking of me when they see me running, and in fact most people have been friendly and said hello as we passed! If someone passes me, it's fine, I'm no longer embarrassed at my speed, we all have different aims!\n\nI'm excited to continue with my running and I hope excuses never get in the way again. I'm amazed I've come from being exhausted at a 1 minute run, to having energy left after 30 minutes!

I started by doing a brisk 30 minute walk, 3 times a week for a month or so.

Feeling writey","author":"ceiimq","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/C25K\/comments\/10kbcmr\/w1d1_done_feeling_writey\/","text":"So I've never been able to run. Even when I was a kid and my parents would drag me hiking every Sunday, and I could walk for six hours straight without pain, I still couldn't run. I had allergic asthma back then, and the mandatory running test at school was my own personalized hell. Every time I failed it I'd hate sports a bit more.\n\nWhen I first found myself broke as a young adult, I started biking everywhere. The uphill climb to get home was hell at first, but I got better, and over the years I eventually started enjoying it. Sometimes I'd leave for work, change my mind, and just go for 100km instead. But even then I couldn't run. A dozen steps and my ankles would start burning like no pain I'd felt before. Unlike when I started biking it wasn't just a matter of puking in the shower afterwards. I just couldn't push through.\n\nAnd I don't know what it is about running specifically, but it's always been this is impossible dream, this wistful regret that never leaves the back of my mind.\n\nWhich brings us to now. I'm in my thirties and haven't been able to work for years, so I barely leave home. I couldn't bike even if I wanted to due to chronic pain. It's been years of feeling my body grow slower, heavier, less responsive until I finally reached this breaking point.\n\nBut I guess life experience isn't all bad. Even though my approach to cycling was always self-destructive and reckless, I've had that experience of looking at myself one day and realizing that something that used to feel impossible isn't even hard anymore. I can believe in it, I guess.\n\nI've also done a lot of progress with my self-esteem. I can read something like \"this program is designed to get anyone running, no matter their physical shape\" and actually believe that this applies to me - that I'm not uniquely broken.\n\nSo anyway, today was my first day. I had a medical appointment so I just used the opportunity to wear comfy clothes and go running right afterwards. It's not like I'd need proper gear for this much, and I wouldn't be able to afford that for the next few months anyway.\n\nThe first stretch was exactly as I remember. Fire in my ankles. Just pain pain pain pain pain. But 60 seconds can't be that long. And I wanted to believe it'd get better somehow. So I stuck with it, with tiny paces, barely a shuffle, and by the end of the minute I was still running. Better enjoy the next 90s before it starts again.\n\nWhen I started the second stretch I was a bit more clear-headed. I tried various step lengths and heights, partly to find the best one, partly just to make the hurt less repetitive. I realized I was just crashing on my feet without doing anything with them. Trying to actively move them felt weird, I didn't really have enough strength. But it helped. The pain was rising, but no faster than the first time. I could do this.\n\nRep three started out painful. I noticed myself shifting my weight forward to try and fall ahead. It's the same thing I do when walking gets hard and I know it's bad. I did my best to stay upright. Small steps, low steps, but without losing the momentum that I'd realized made things easier. It was definitely the hardest rep.\n\nDuring the walk before rep four, I crossed paths with another runner. I noticed his hands swinging prominently. I asked myself what I was doing with my own hands.\n\nAs I started running again, I tried paying attention to my arms. I'd always kind of rolled my shoulders back and forth while running, but it didn't feel like it contributed anything, so I tried other movements. I found something that felt right. Pumping my elbows and forearms parallel with my run, with as little torso twisting as possible, pulled me onward in a strange and encouraging way. It was hard to get right and once again I didn't feel like I had the right muscles, but as I kept trying stuff, rep four ended safety.\n\nThe second half was a breeze, comparatively. I wasn't sure at first, and was feeling a bit discouraged at the thought of redoing all I'd just done a second time. But I had things to pay attention to, movements I knew would make it easier if I could do them right, and I was also starting to trust the format more. \"Just do your thing\", I could tell myself. \"The rep will end soon enough\".\n\nBy the time of rep 6-7 I was able to get a visual idea of how far I'd be running with each one. I'd look ahead and it felt achievable.\n\n\"Start cooling down\", my app finally said. I went back to walking, and some random guy shouted \"Faster! What the hell was that\" and laughed. Fuck you, random guy. I did it and you can't discourage me anymore.\n\nMy experience with other physical activities tells me the second time is likely to be harder than the first. And I don't have an appointment this time so it's definitely going to take more determination to leave the house just to run. But I hope I'll be able to get into that groove again. It hurt, but it felt good, and I feel really proud.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674582579.0},{"title":"Training for a 10k at the end of April. My W3D1 is done.

This makes me nervous that it\u2019s too high, so I tend to end my run and begin walking again about 5-10 seconds too early, once I see my heart rate hit 175 bpm. I feel physically fine, I just worry that my heart rate is too high. \n\nAdmittedly, I\u2019m not in great shape but that\u2019s why I\u2019m starting the program. I\u2019m in my early 20s and 5\u20194\u201d, female. I use an Apple Watch to monitor my heart rate but I also use the built in heart rate sensor on the treadmill. They give me approximately the same reading as each other. \n\nThanks for any and all advice! Hope to make it through the program.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674496743.0},{"title":"Sore hip - should I take a break to low impact","author":"prissyelliot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/C25K\/comments\/10jq0ku\/sore_hip_should_i_take_a_break_to_low_impact\/","text":"Hello!

I've run on and off ever since, but never really enjoyed it. I would always run consistently for a few weeks but then just quit out of sheer misery. I never once felt much joy and satisfaction in the process. Two or three times a year I would go through the same process. I'd do it reluctantly, suffer, and then give up swearing to never run again. What the heck are all these people who devote their lives to running getting from this? I'd ask myself.  And yet, I'd always start back up again in a few months when the weather was nicer or my birthday was close.\n\nA few weeks ago it hit me, and I accepted that I was going about it all wrong: yes, I could run three miles if I forced myself. But I've not given my body a chance to adapt to three miles so of course it was going to feel terrible. I squashed my ego and decided to restart the whole program from day one and friends I think that's the answer I was looking for. It was slightly uncomfortable, but manageable and I actually found myself having fun because my legs weren't feeling dead after 10 minutes and I could go at a pace that was fast enough to be enjoyable for me.\n\nSo I guess I'm going to see this through and work my way up to 10k four or five times a week (which has always been my goal) and maybe I'll actually like it this time!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674446480.0},{"title":"I did it!
