It would also tell me more about the types of bacteria that are present in the starter. This is my first time writing a research paper and I am clueless as to how I would even arrange to make such tests. Does anyone have any advice as to how I could proceed? Any answers are much appreciated",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/116fg74/wolf_encounter_last_night/",
        "text": "Howdy, im wondering if somebody could give me a little more insight about the behaviour of a wolf i encountered last night with a friend.\n\nI live in the German alps where we have quite a few wolves living. Last night at around 3am me and my friend where sitting by the bonfire, and decided to go for a little night walk beacuse the night sky was amazing. \n\nAt one point we had to walk across about 1km of open field between two small \"villages\" or rather settlements of a few houses. \n\nAbout 200 meters to  left of us there is a small barn where a farmer lives. \nWhen we noticed someone on the second floor was following something on the field with his bright torch, so i swung my torch around to check out what he was looking at (already odd that he was doing so at 3am).\n\nVery quickly a what we think couldve only been a wolf came into the spotlight of both, the farmers and our flashlights. \nThe wolf at first started to walk in a straight line towards the treeline of the forest, when he stopped dead in his tracks and looked at us, his green/red white firey glowy eyes reflected back to us. \nAfter about 30 seconds of a staredown he started to walk, then gallop towards us. \n\nImmediately we started to walk slowly to the next village, as we didnt want to signal to him that we were prey that would run from him. As we started walking, his galloping turned into a faster gallop, covering about 50 meters in no time, which is when we started sprinting as he was now only about 100 meters from us. \nAll the while were running, im pointing my flashlight backwards at him to keep him insight. He stopped the pursuit once we entered the village (presumably because he knows that a populated area is way too dangerous for him to go).\nBut essentially got very close to us (about 80 meters).\n\nA few factors that made us certain it was a wolf:\n1.)  Walking in determined absolutely straight lines (as to preserve energy, as they dont know when they will have their next meal, unlike a dog that might wonder a little left or right, as he knows he will definitely get fed)\n\n2.)  The sheer size of this absolut unit (we were flabbergasted) \n\n3.) His movement and behaviour once we entered the village.\n\n4.) We had a good look at him during the staredown, while being illuminated from 2 different angles by the farmers torch and mine. \n\n5.) Once we got to the village we came across an absolutely terrified cat. (The housecats here in this area are badasses and no comparisson to city cats) \nI smoke a joint on my balcony every night and have seen many many cat hunts from start to finish, also have seen just about every behaviour a cat has to offer, but this was a first.\nIve never seen a cat this terrified.\n\n6.) The silence and fluidity of the wolfs movement. A dog maybe wouldve barked or reacted different. \n\nQuestion: A wolf of this size could hunt just about anything that lives in this area, why would he show this behaviour towards humans, when they are definitely smart enough to know how dangerous a human is.\nWas it maybe because he felt threatened being lit up by two torches from different angles? \n\nCheers",

Is this correct? \n\nFrom what I understand, which probably isn’t right so please correct me, adult neurogenesis occurs in certain areas of the brain like the hippocampus. There’s a stage of massive growing of neurons, which most don’t make it past a few days as they are pruned. When a neuron is formed, it weakly connected to a neighboring network of neurons. Over time, the connections are pruned if unimportant and strengthened if used a lot. This process doesn’t really replace old neurons but allows for new features to be learned at the cost of slowly forgetting old tasks/memories. \n\nHow did I do? What is wrong? Do you have a better way of thinking about this? Thanks in advance",

I think I understand that a male tigon and a male liger are different because they have the Y chromosome from their father and an x chromosome from their mother but my question is if a female lion or tigon is born aren't they the same animal since the animal would have the x chromosome from both a lion and a tiger or are they different.",

About two and a half weeks ago my dad brought home a hunk of unidentifiable meat and told my brother and i that its good and we should eat it but he does not even know what it is and neither do my brother and i. Its like. It looks like the thigh of an animal but it is completely unidentifiable im telling you. Ive spent hours on this mystery with my friend and we have basically no leads. All we know is that its a mammal and probably marinated. Im growing increasingly scared and concerned. My brother had some and he said it kind of tastes like pork. Im looking at multiple sources and human meat is said to taste like pork. Ive never seen anything like this meat in my entire life. Im scared, worried, concerned, bewildered. I dont even know where my dad got said meat but im quite literally afraid to ask. When my brother made some of the meat the house smelled horrible, albeit he did say that it didnt taste that bad. But he still doesnt want to eat it and god knows im not touching that stuff. My dad keeps insisting that we eat it and he got mad when my brother and i declined? Im scared, worried, distressed. Here are the pictures. If anyone knows what this is please, enlighten me. Please. I have no idea where else to turn besides biologists.\n\n[red meat??????](https://preview.redd.it/pds8xo0t00ja1.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=21d507ac33c3c51a760b0dbc7a401d0dbff29767)",

        "text": "For those of you who are unaware, an article was recently published in Trends in Ecology and Evolution to present the EEB language project The aim of the project is to encourage biologists, even those working in non-human domains, to move away from using terms like \"male\" and \"female\", (and replace them with terms like \"sperm-producer\" and \"egg-producer\") in the name of using \"more inclusive, less harmful\" language. I know this is nothing entirely new, but this is the first time I have seen such a formal call to action published in a big journal in the field.\n\nMy rational take on the whole thing is this is a dangerous path forward, if it gets to the point where you are at risk of losing a job and/or being denied funds for not using the proper \"language\". I'm not calling for the initiative to be outright barred, as I feel like some good could come from these types of discussions. For example, I always thought the term \"daughter cell\" was awkward and would have no issue switching to something like \"progeny cell\". But I also don't think one should be ostracized for making the argument that abolishing language such as male and female causes a greater net harm than good, and deciding to stick with using them in the teaching, research, etc, regardless of what the future culture brings.\n\nMy spicy and controversial take on the whole thing is many of those involved with the project couldn't give a rat's ass about making colleagues and students feel included. It's all fueled by careerism, when participation in such initiatives is now essentially required for tenure-track hiring and even getting research grants! Curious on some other diverse takes on the whole thing.",

So there's a working group over in Bristol that's doing amazing research and I'm considering to go there for a post-doc after my PhD (in 2 years). My girlfriend is a molecular biologist (MSc) and I'm afraid that for her the move would be a downgrade. Since she loves lab work, she decided on a lab technician route. However, at the biotech/pharma company that she's working for, she's earning about 32000€. She's doing all kinds of advanced biosynthesis there (just no office work, she despises that) and is highly efficient, so she's likely to get a hefty raise as well. Bonuses apply on top. Now when I look into UK salaries, what Google is spitting out sounds very miserable (plus rents seem outrageous, especially in Bristol). Is it actually as bad as it seems over there? \n\nI'm aware that wages are lower in general than here in Germany. For my prospective position, it would be 10% less. I'm fine-ish with that. But for my gf, if the internet is right, it seems like 30-40% less and that would be a no go.",

While many sites replicate the advice that some herbs and scents repel wasps, i´ve seen no real proof or experimentation linked.\n\nSo i´m asking whether you have come across some resources i might use in this endeavor? I´m mostly concerned about the european wasp.\n\nOf special interest is research on which chemicals repel and attract wasps. While it might be useful to know that peppermint repels wasps, it would be even more useful to know that the menthol included in peppermint is the driving repellant- For this would allow me to maximize the effects while also allowing me more freedom in creating a perfume which actually might smell decent.\n\nAlso, of course, any research on which scents attract wasps is also relevant. While i will simply abstain from wearing perfume during daylight hours in the wasp season it would be a shame if i´d create a wasp repelling scent for me, only to counteract it by including some chemicals with the opposite effect.",

Produce a key to show the nature of genes associated with the length of the flowers. Justify choice of letters and presentation.** \n\n**Q2: One of the several genes involved with the flower colours has two alleles, yellow and blue which in combination give a flower coloured green. Produce a key to show the nature of genes associated with the colour of the flowers. Justify choice of letters and presentation.** \n\n**Q3:A yellow flower that is long is crossed with a green flower that is long as well. What are the possible genotypes and why. Use answer of the key of previous question to answer this question.**\n\nI am confused because how would you show the key for Q3 as wouldn't the genotypes for colour of flowers be C\\^Y C\\^Y and C\\^Y C\\^B. How would you show the alleles for long and short alongside this?",

Does it make it take more energy to make the wall? Or is it more complex than just a change to the wall.\n\nAnd, while we are at it, is it the same for bacteriophage resistance?\n\nFinally, why are the 2 mostly exclusive, where to be more resistant to one, you must be less resistant to the other?\n\nThanks!",

I don't think I could later become a biologist for example and I don't want to be a field tech for years. I studied natural resource economics. Thoughts? Anyone become biologists without degrees?
