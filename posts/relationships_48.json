But I don’t know if I’m in love with her. With my previous partners, I experienced butterflies. I was over the moon, head over heels falling in love. But I’m not like this with her. \n\nI sometimes worry that just cause I love her doesn’t mean I should be in a relationship with her but I truly am happy being with her. I don’t know what to do or how to address this issue.\n\nTl;dr I love my gf but I don’t know if I’m in love with her",

        "text": "This is going to be a long read, to thank you for bearing with me, or for skipping to the tldr, I know it’s a lot. \n\nLittle bit of preface is mandatory. We’ve been together three years, at first things where great, then it started all to fade away. She was in the closet, deeply in the closet, and our relationship was a secret for anybody, even her kids. \n\nShe never tried, nor wanted to, come out. She comes from a very homophobic background, and a very homophobic family, she was dealing with internalize homophobia, and that’s how our relationship was, a secret. \n\nBut those weren’t the issue. I never wanted for her to tell the world about us, those weren’t our problems, I wanted to have the basics of what a relationship entails, and that was lacking.\n\nOur relationship deteriorated, I was trying to communicate, she was not having any of that, my needs weren’t heard let alone fulfilled, it was all how she wanted it when she wanted it. I had to walk on eggshells around what to say or how to say it, how to behave in public, how to not behave in private, I had to watch out for what outburst she might have this time, or what mood was she on this day. It was draining, it was soul crushing, and it became violent. At first she pushed me, then she grabbed and pulled me, at last she put her hands around my throat to shut me up during and argument. I let her, I’m not proud of that, but she wasn’t like this all the time. I started therapy, tried to encourage her to go as well, but she wouldn’t, so after time we separated.\n\nFor two months I had no idea what she was doing, and I don’t know if she had any about what I was doing, but for two months we didn’t speak or see each other. \n\nMistakenly, maybe, I reached out. I needed her, or maybe I needed to know that all those years spend together where I invested myself so deeply into somebody that probably didn’t deserve it weren’t in vain. I don’t know the real reason, but we reconnected. \n\nAs soon as I reached out she told me her beloved father passed away the previous month, and that hit me like a sledgehammer, I knew how close she was to him, and I was as mortified and deeply saddened for her. I immediately offered every support I could possibly offer. Time, money, shoulder to cry on, attentive ear, help with the funeral preparations, help with the kids, anything she needed. She was grieving, I could imagine she was, but she wasn’t showing it, probably because that how she is wired. \n\nShe left for the funeral, I would’ve loved to go with her, but because I didn’t know I don’t have the time to arrange leaving with her. She left for two weeks, and we didn’t talk much in those days, I understood, she was dealing with other things, and I was not a priority at that time, and probably could not offer the same support her family could. \n\nWhen she got back things did not change much. She didn’t seem to want support from me, if not financial, and she took it from family and close friends. That’s ok, I said to myself, everybody grief differently.\n\nThen out of nowhere we had another fight. It was petty, but it sounded so much like the fights we used to have in the past. I selfishly told her that I was disappointed she didn’t call me when she left to have dinner with her daughter in law who I would’ve loved to meet. I didn’t think much of it, it was merely me stating something, but she, as always, took it as a personal attack.\n\nShe started saying that I’m not to be every time with them, that I don’t know how to behave, that those people are not in my category, and that I was stating to show my true ugly colors. \n\nIt was an overreaction in my view, and it had nothing to do with her grief. Even before her father passed away she would indulge in these little pleasantries, at least this time she did not use outright insults. Even before she would disregard completely what was said and aim straight at the jugular, sometimes literally.\n\nI told her that the way she spoke to me was unacceptable, then I kept quite for a day or two thinking that maybe she would understand, apologize, try to talk it through. Of course she didn’t, she never did. \n\nSo I called again, thinking that we could lay an olive’s brunch and carry on. She said she was going to call me back because she was doing something, she never did.\n\nSo I took up the last bit of energy I had left and told her plain and straight that this was it, that is was not going to stand for this anymore because it was not healthy. She didn’t say anything, and silently accepted it saying she just lost her dad and couldn’t deal with my rubbish. I am filled with guilt, and kept thinking that I had to be patient, that I did not have to make it about me because she was grieving, and that this time, more than any other time , I should’ve put my needs aside and be the partner she needed. \n\nTLDR I broke up with my partner after three months of her father’s death because of how unhealthy she has made me feel, and now I’m not feeling so proud about it",

All the dates were always planned by me, and she never initiated anything, except some reactions to my instagram stories. After we hooked up, she asked me to be exclusive. \n\nI agreed, because I really liked her, even if I thought things were going REALLY fast. She is my first girlfriend. \n\nFast forward 1 month, I’m already in love lol. I know it can seem fast, but we spent a lot of time getting to know each other and I really feel, for the first time in my life, safe with her. It seems weird, but I had a home with parents that fought everyday. Being with her, brought me peace for the first time. Even if I loved her, I noticed some things were pretty weird. First, she had two relationships before me. And both ended for the same reason : “they did nothing wrong, but they stressed me and I had a mental block with them out of nowhere”. I don’t understand what does that mean. \n\nAlso, she never initiated anything. No intimacy, no conversation topics, no dates, no plans, nothing. When I asked her about it, she told me she just didn’t feel the need to see me more than once per week, and that she is shy. \n\nTwo weeks ago, we were having a conversation were I was a bit confused, so I asked her if she still felt the same about us. She told me that she did feel the same, but she was scared that I would stress her in a near future. Now, I was really hurt by that, but she told me she was saying that because she loved me and she didn’t want it to happen with me and that I was overreacting. I decided to just brush it off\n\nShe is also the really jealous type. She snoops through my phone, and sometimes gets really mad when I talk with some of my female friends. \n\nBut something was a bit too much. Yesterday night, after a jealousy tantrum from her, I took her to a party. She purposefully didn’t invite me, while I invited her in all my parties but I didn’t really care. At some point she doesn’t answer my texts anymore. Her friend texts me from my GF’s phone that she got wasted, and that she was unconscious. I start to worry, but her friend tells me that she’s “just enjoying her party”. \nNext day I got pretty mad because I got worried, and she expected me to have a perfect behavior while she got wasted at parties. \nShe tried to blame it on me and later on cried in my arms saying that she would have been worried too and that she was sorry. \n\nI know that this is a new relationship but it seems really difficult for a start. \nAre these behaviors normal in a relationship or should i be worried for the future ?\n\nTL;DR : Is my (18M) girlfriend (18F) a red flag ?",

Here's the issue: While we were talking about what expectations our immigrant parents have on each of us for our marriages in the future, I brought up how I don't really know if I want my own kids or not. \n\nTo this, he said that sometimes you may change your mindset in the future as you grow older looking at everybody else around you. He then used himself as an example and said that 2-3 years ago, he didn't even want to get married but now, thinking about how his friends are going to be married and busy with their lives soon, he feels like he has too as well. \n\nWhile I am completely on the fence about having kids, I definitely know that I want to get married to somebody someday (definitely someone that would not favor kids either if I decide to go that route). Talking to him is still new to me (we only met twice but we literally spent 4 whole days together the 2nd time we met) so I'm not sure if I should still continue talking to him or not. (It also doesn't help that I moved a couple months ago so we're also now living in different states. I guess maybe things just aren't meant to go anywhere either way and I'm looking too much into this.)

Even though she has a boyfriend, she seems strangely clingy with my boyfriend. When he was distant the first few weeks after meeting me (we were busy doing things together) she drunkenly messaged him saying she was sad they were doing less things together. I found this to be very strange. Another thing that concerned me is that when I met her, she seemed very standoffish even though I was doing my absolute best to be warm and nice to her.\n\nI suppose the bottom line is that I just feel sick and uncomfortable at the idea of a woman my partner has slept with being a constant in my life. The only reason I’m trying to overlook it is because everything is perfect otherwise. I can’t expect him to cut her out and never would expect that, but how do I get over this?\n\nTL;DR: I need advice on how to not think about my boyfriend having sex with his friend every time I hear her name or see her lmao",

They meet up a couple of times a month for dinner etc. I’m currently away for work. Last night they went for dinner and he text me at around midnight to say she had got drunk and was going to stay over. Because of time zones, I got this message during a big presentation (the reason for my work trip). I didn’t reply, and he sent a few messages asking if I was ok with it and I replied in the break to say it was fine. I mean in the moment I was fine with it. I totally trust him and I also didn’t feel I could say that she should drive home drunk (and she lives an hour away so a taxi would be very expensive). Anyway it’s now a day later and when we were chatting on the phone I said that actually I was feeling a bit uncomfortable about it all. I do totally trust him and I am fine with their friendship, but I feel staying over was a bit of a boundary. And that texting me whilst he knew I was doing a big presentation was a bit weird, as it could have really thrown me off. I expected us to have a grown up conversation, and to discuss boundaries and why it made me feel uncomfortable. Perhaps i was also seeking an apology or some validation that it’s ok that it made me feel weird. I wasn’t looking for reassurance or asking if anything happened (I know it wouldn’t). Instead he blew up and reacted really badly. He said I should trust him and that he was totally honest with me and now wishes he just hadn’t told me (wtf???). I’m flummoxed!! I mean…. Am I being out of order for changing my reaction? Should I have just left it and not said anything? I wish I hadn’t said anything because I really don’t care about the friendship, it’s just the staying over thing is a bit disrespectful right?!! \n\nTDLR ; my bf let his ex stay over and when I said it made me uncomfortable he didn’t react very well.",

        "text": "So I (25f) started seeing this guy (26m). We really hit it off and he's a great guy, its been a few weeks and we've had a few dates and last night he invited me over for dinner at his place. Immedietely upon getting there, in this nice suburb with his 4 cars parked in the driveway (he collects and works on vintage cars and trucks, those were just a few of his most recent projects and his daily driver), I felt so out of place. His home was huge and beautiful, he cooked an amazing meal for us and told me about his upcoming trip to a different country at the end of the month. He also explained how he was renovating this house (most of it had already clearly been done) and was getting ready to sell it for well over twice what he paid for it. He was really good at flipping houses, this being his 3rd one in 5 years, and was getting into flipping investment properties and had a whole 5 year plan to quit his day job once these investments took off. I admire the level of ambition he has and think he has a great future ahead of him but honestly, I couldn't imagine doing what he does.\n\nI, on the other hand, am living in a way lower caliber than him. I recently bought my home, but its really just an old, run down fixer-upper type single wide trailer. I live out in the countryside, pretty much next to a farm. I have a job that I really like and don't plan on leaving, but it pays below poverty wages. I make ends meet and, while I wish I had extra money to fix some of the major issues at my house, other than that I'm content with my life. I've never been a super ambitious or money-driven person, living comfortably and spending my days having good experiences with good people is enough for me. \n\nBut now, I just feel embarrassed, and I don't even want him to come over at all. I'm not sure if I'm more embarrassed about the actual state of my house, or just having to admit that I'm happy with the life I have, despite how low-quality it may appear. I'm just afraid he's going to judge me. I've expressed this to him, and he's said that it couldn't be worse than some of the houses he lived in as a child, and that he's not judgemental. I want to believe that that's true, but I still can't shake the feeling that I should maybe want more for myself in life, I just don't. I recognize that could be a turn off, but I can't change who I am or how I am. What do I do?  \n\nTl;dr: hitting it off with a guy who is much wealthier and ambitious than I am and I'm intimidated by it/nervous to let him see how I live",

        "text": "I've been dating my current boyfriend for 2,5 years. We have been living together for a year.\n\nI love him, I really do. The main issue in our relationship has been his mood swings, it's like a rollercoaster. He has depressive episodes, then suddenly he is superhappy. Our relationship follows his moodswings, when he feels great he tells me that I am the love of his life. When he is in a bad period, he doubts our relationships, is upset cause he doesn't get why I'm still with him, tells me to look for better.\n\nHe also makes comments about me, especially from January 2022 until July 2022 he was in an extremely depressive episode. He would tell me things such as: 'You are a boring person, you are just luggage to me, you can't even make your BF cum, When you go out with your friends you look handsome, but what do I have at home', he has told me that he wished I was less 'boring' and more like his toxic ex's, that he was numb and didn't know if he still loved me, that he wanted an open relationship and then he told me 'in fact no, I want to feel like I can be in an open relationship, he complained about me being 'too kind'.\n\nI stayed with him through all of this. He went to therapy, we argued less. This made him sad cause 'We only argue less cause you are too patient'.\n\nHis therapy payed off, he became himself again: kind, caring, loving. Still with up's and downs, but no longer rude and more appreciative.\n\nUntil 2 months ago, things were fine. He told me how much he enjoyed being with me, living with me and that he was so happy. Then he argued with a friend, and he started to spiral again.\n\nI'm in a local pub quiz team. One of the people there is another gay guy, John. I never payed attention to John. My BF, who is still extremely good friends with his ex's, got jealous about John, cause John is a handsome man.\n\nI only communicate with John through our Pub Quiz group on whatsapp. Yet my BF was jealous because John is 'everything he isn't': stable, kind, likes kids and the idea of marriage, lives in the area I used to live and adore, is more calm. Those are things he said, not me.\n\nI invited my BF to the Pub Quiz, but he always refused and made a scene. I told him that I could stop going to the Pub Quiz if it made him uncomfortable, but he didn't want me to do that either. After each Pub Quiz, he needs to be reassured so much about me loving him.\n\nIn a way, I started to be turned of by my BF, how suddenly he needs to be reassured while whenever I said something about him being way too close to his ex, I was crazy. How he said so many hurtful things and he just didn't care, how he broke my heart saying he wanted to be with other people, and how now, suddenly, HE is the one needing reassurance.\n\nAnd slowly but surely, I think I am falling in love with John. There is still no contact between us besides the whatsapp group. Even at the Pub Quiz, we don't do anything 'together'. It's just that I am happy whenever I see his name on my screen, whenever we are at the Quiz together.\n\nI won't act on it, I can't tell my BF, I just don't know what to do or what this means\n\nTl;dr: I am having feelings for someone else, could you give me advice on how to move forward?",

        "text": "This is going to be a long, heavy message, so I apologize in advance.\n\nLet’s put a little context: my partner (Male, 25YO) and I (Male, 23YO) have been in a relationship since March 2022. I suspected about him cheating on my multiple times since the first time we spoke about exclusive relationship (March, indeed). However, multiple times I was forced to believe that I was being a bad person because I would not let him be in peace with such a friend (let’s call him C). So, when we start dating, he is also seeing C, which I do not complain about, since we were not exclusive before March. However, when I notice I might be falling in love, I tell him I needed to distance myself because I thought that, if we continued to see each other while he was seeing C, I would start feeling a little bit sad. My partner’s answer was: I love you too, so I will stop seeing C. That does not happen, of course. They talk on a daily basis and I receive constant information about C. He is older than us, 40Y, which is something my boyfriend sometimes comment about, “he is a very mature person” kind of stuff. Okay…\n\nThings start getting worse. They see each other again and they kiss (that is what I am told). I do not complain, I just start crying a little bit. My boyfriend tells me he is going to stop seeing C for good. Okay, I say. But they keep talking, more and more often. He goes to his house to have lunch because C’s house is much nearer to my partner's job than mine is. Okay, I do not complain. But I start seeing something weird. My partner was going through his mobile phone by my side and I keep seeing this messages from many boys asking him to “f- them” and many other comments about how their sex was great. Cry again from me. He tells me it’s OK and not to worry; they are all ex’s, he has nothing with them right not. «Why would you talk to them, then? You changed your phone number, so you are the one who reached them». «Because I get along well with them». «Okay», I finally say, but he stops that thing, so that is a win I guess.\n\nC is along the way all the time. I keep receiving information from him. The night of my graduation from university, my boyfriend goes to his house, sleeps with him, of course have sex with him, but he denies by that time. I had been grieving for many things, and I was one scratching my skin without noticing, and he finds out but then suddenly forgets and, two weeks later, asks me when ‘that scars’ are going to disappear. I freak out. Multiple things have happened since then, this is July. Mostly, both my boyfriend and C have told me that they do not understand who I am capable of doing what I am doing (feeling bad?) because my boyfriend has barely any friends besides him and I am trying to ‘forbid’ their relationship. I start thinking that I am crazy, because I never did such a thing as prohibiting him of seeing C or anything, I just wanted not to be cheated. They made me believe that I was making all that up.\n\nBy the way, they insisted on me meeting with C, which I agreed, because maybe in that situation I could force myself to understand their friendship and not think that there was anything else besides friendship. C is egocentric, he bullies people, he calls people fat, ugly, and many other stuff I will not comment because I just want to puke remembering it.\n\nI have been constantly told that: that I am selfish because I do not respect a friendship that is not going to harm me. But I kind of continued with my scratching because I was thinking: «I am going insane, I am crazy and such a bad person». So I start talking with my friends, and all they could tell me is: «You are in a clearly manipulative, abusive relationship». I started going to therapy because of course “it was my fault and I was the one that needed to solve it”. Same thing: my therapist (which I had seen a couple of years ago due to OCD) saw me in huge distress and told me that when I finally “finished” therapy she saw a confidence in me that she did was not able to see now. Again: my relationship was abusive.\n\nNovember 2022. I have a phone call with C to try to solve everything, but since he is 40 YO and I am 23, he tells me that he does not want to solve anything with a childish guy who is so insecure about everything. In his own words: «I am 40YO, I do not need to have this conversation with you. Grow up. Look at me: I am handsome and attractive, I have huge muscles, a house of my own, and a big d----. It is not my fault that you have your own insecurities. Have that fixed up and then maybe we can talk this bullshit». I start crying again, which I hate because I have never felt that weak before, crying all over the place constantly. My boyfriend finds out but he decides anyway he is going to take care of C's pets while he is outside for a week. So my boyfriend goes to his house and spend that week there.\n\nDecember 2022, I finally found out that my boyfriend had been cheating on me (I actually did not know before, only presumed). From the first day we started dating and since then. Not only with C, but with more people. Unprotected sex. By that time, my assumptions made me stop having my immunosuppressive therapy (I have a chronic disease) because I was fearful I could contract and STD if he had been doing so. I start being ill, physically. We start going to couples therapy because he does not want to lose me, and by that time I do not want to lose him either. We have not explored many details, of how they made me feel how awful person I was sometimes, or that they made me truly believe that I was going crazy.\n\nThe way I found out: when he went to pick C's keys from his house, to take care of the cats, they slept together, and I had spend the night waiting for my boyfriend to get to his own house, I was waiting for him to go and have a conversation, since we had a fight that day and I did not want us to be mad while we were not going to see each other for that week. He never arrived to his house, he slept in C's.\n\nOur therapist is telling me that me not being able to advance from rage and sadness is going to lead me unconsciously to punish my partner. I told him I just want to revisit certain things that I considered were the most harmful because I want to heal, that we did not discuss that and that I only had one session where I truly could explore the rage and anger I was feeling (by merely crying and saying things like ‘why, why, why’), but he tells me he is afraid this process we are carrying is going to make my partner leave, because the process will be too difficult for him.\n\nHe is now a totally different person, the person I fell in love with, but I am having trouble trying to readapt everything. I have developed such a bad self-esteem.\n\nSo, this is: I am grieving because of all the things that happened, and my partner Is going to leave because of that. 9 months of lying, cheating and manipulating me (this is the first time I am able to say that he has manipulated me), vs 2 months of therapy since I found out the truth, and I am making the process difficult? This therapist told things like he saw himself reflected on my partner, that they are very much alike, and that if I already understood that he cheated on me because he was searching for a love he was afraid his family won’t give him. Is this normal? Because I am just freezing right now, I am in a position where I am starting to feel physically ill and I do not know what to do, because he told me I could not comment any more stuff about my relationship with my friends. I only talked to my friends because I needed to know if I was actually a bad person, but they got so scared about me that they have been constantly asking me if I was okay, and how he was treating me, but now I cannot comment anything more because my therapist said I am creating a barrier between my partner and me. Help me, please?\n\nTl;dr: cheated on me multiple times, manipulated the truth, going to therapy to fix it after he realized he did not want to lose me, therapist siding with him?",

He said he will be there if I want to talk to him about anything and we are being civil. He still has all our pictures up and hasn’t returned my stuff but I haven’t really asked for it.\n\nI keep having mixed emotions about it all, I text him apologising for everything a few days ago and he replied saying he would bring my stuff round. I then phoned him stupidly and on the phone he said I hadn’t bothered texting him prior and that he was hurt by that. I said I wanted to give him space but he said that it was poor for me not even sending a message yet he said now isn’t the right time for us to be together and he can’t be in a relationship…\n\nTL:DR split up 4 days ago, ex been active on social media but still got all our pictures and in a relationship on Facebook.

I was constantly berated about marriage, children and what she deserves as she deserves all of these things at a certain time after being together for a few years. \n\nI want to know is this normal? \n\nSo last time we broke up she was constantly ringing and texting me saying things like \n-you blind sided me \n-This is wrong we should be together \n-there's no reason for us to break up\n-I don't know what I'm going to do now my life is ruined\n-I've got nothing now you've taken everything from me\n-I can't have children now we are not together \n\nAfter all this I caved and we are now back togther. \n\nEven before all this she would say and do things like:\n-hold my hand and pretend you love me (says jokingly but if didn't she would be upset? \n-stops walking and won't move until I kiss her. If she wants a kiss and I don't oblige she gets upset. \n-always asking what are your intentions with me, what do you love about me and tell me something sweet or cute. \n\nI used to have excellent patience not alot of things would get to me but lately I have a very short fuse now. When she gets to me and I get annoyed and I slightly raise my voice she crys and that shuts me down. I'm not proud I raise my voice its something I'm working on and getting back into therapy again. \n\nSorry about the crude wall of text but any advice or opinions on this behaviour I would appreciate. I cannot talk to anyone else yet as I am afraid I will be annoying my friends over it again.",

I told him if he ever wants to marry me that's not something I'm ok with in a husband. (This is my boundary you don't have to understand it)\n\n\nEvery time I leave the house I think about that and it consumes me and I can't enjoy my time out..Today he was going to leave the house and it seemed as if he was worried that I was going to watch porn and he wanted a quickie. I searched\nporn on my browser to show him how it feels and he saw it yesterday. \n\n\nI said I'm good off a quickie and he got a lil attitude cause the porn think I think?? (He's never pushy with sex so that's why I assumed). I feel that exact way when I leave. \n\nHe says if I watch porn it doesn't\nbother him but that action showed different.\n\n\nAnyways it's on my mind most of the day it really bothers me to the point where I don't want to go out without him so he doesn't do it. I don't know what to do.. anyone have advice ?",

        "text": "Long story short, we’ve been together for about 5 years but had a falling out a few months ago, after which he moved out (his own decision, I didn’t kick him out or anything), although we didn’t break up. We kept meeting up for dinner dates regularly, talked things out and reached an understanding I think, and he moved back in about a month ago. And we haven’t had any sex yet. To be fair, he was sick for the first two weeks, but still.\n\nNow, we've always had a fairly healthy sex life, sex is extremely important to me, and it was one of the things we discussed over the months of “separation” so he's aware. And we’re still quite affectionate, including physically, and we sleep naked and all that. It’s getting to the point where it’s really difficult for me to touch him, see him naked or feel him pressed up against my back when we cuddle to sleep, because I can’t even appreciate the intimacy anymore, I just want to fuck the living daylights out of him and being horny (for him, masturbation doesn't help) all the time is stressing me out. I tried to (meekly) initiate, we made out a few times but it just doesn’t progress in the same way it used to. Although I used to be a bit bolder about it and would just grab his dick and go for it, and I just don’t feel confident enough to do that now after we were touch and go for some time. If he’d shown me any kind of sexual response, I’d take charge and run with it, but he just… hasn’t. Like, at all.\n\nI know the obvious answer here is to talk to him. But I base a lot of my self-worth on sex (this is something I’m working on in therapy), and saying “hey why don’t you want to fuck me?” feels incredibly demeaning. I can’t figure out a way to approach this subject verbally without making myself feel small and worthless, or making him feel like he owes me sex, which he definitely doesn’t. The only thing that feels natural is just to keep trying to initiate sex in subtle ways, but that’s clearly not working, so I don’t know what else to do. Any advice?\n\n**TL;DR:** boyfriend moved back in after fight, no sex is happening, girlfriend confused how to proceed.",

There was this white girl who lived three houses down and she was about 8 y/o I’d say.\n\nWe started to get to know each other and would play on the playground. Our parents never met each other but we’d just play outside every other day and she treated me sort of like a big brother.

She took me to her basement and lifted her top and stood there with her n*****s out. \n\nI was SHOCKED! I looked at them for 1 second and back to her face and told her \"what are you doing?\" And she just smiled and laughed saying I wanted to show you. I told her to put her top back on and to not do that to other people again and then we went out and played for a bit and I went home.\n\nWe sort of stopped talking after this as she wouldn’t come out as much and we just would be outside at different times if I remember correctly. The point of this story is I found myself asking out someone with the same age gap I had at that time with that girl but only as an adult and I’m feeling guilty. I don’t know why this memory came back to my mind as of late and wont leave. I havent even told my family this story.\n\nTDLR - 24m rejected by 19f in my class.

We obviously really liked each other, and surely enough the next night we kissed, nothing more. The following days were similar, skiing, talking, smoking, drinking, kissing and hugging (and nothing more) and overall just really *really* enjoying each other's company, saying we really like each other, sleeping in the same bed, etc.. After five days the holiday ends and we say goodbye, unsure but (me, at least) very hopeful it might go somewhere, and confident that she felt similarly.\n\nFast forward a week later, and I'm back home (in France), she is back with her boyfriend (elsewhere in Europe), and she told me she wants to \"try to fix her relationship\". From where I'm sitting, there is no way in hell this could ever possibly happen, since she fully cheated on him, with me, for three days straight. But this is what she has decided. I don't know how to proceed.. I certainly don't want to tell her to just break up with him already (or do I?), but I also don't want to end up waiting for something that will never happen, which is what I'm currently doing. I should probably just let it go, but I just can't seem to get over that incredible ski-holiday that I had with her. Should I just let it go, or try harder and go after her?\n\n**TL;DR:** I fell for and had a three day fling with a girl who has a boyfriend during a ski-holiday. Now she's back with him wants to try to fix their relationship, and I still like her. I don't know whether to let it go or try harder.",

        "text": " \n\nI am in an LDR with by boyfriend. Our relationship has issues already. I've been going through a lot in the last months, one being losing my work and income. My relationships has upsetting aspects too, mainly he is in the Officer School (Europe, not US) and I feel he doesn't prioritize our relationship, outside of his army time. I feel he'd spend his free time gamin or hanging out with a good friend (not anymore recently, because they fought). I told him that it seems to me he is losing interest and if that's the case, he should tell me.\n\nHe said he is not, that it's the opposite.   He does tell me he loves me every day. Before having that talk about him losing interest, I spoke or complained various times that I miss him, that I wish we spent more time together, I even cried once in a cam call because I missed him so much. When we had the talk about him losing interest, he also said that he was stressed out in his previous relationship and dedicated his ex less time, that he didn't take her needs into consideration, and he'd play games to keep his mind off some life stressors he was dealing with. She eventually broke up with him, because he said, because of his behavior, she started to doubt his feelings for her. They were LDR too and he was not making much effort to see her, he claimed also because of stress.  He said he doesn't want that to happen in his relationship, and he is glad I told him and he will put more effort. This was almost two weeks ago.\n\n I was somewhat skeptical, the discussion prolonged, he got annoyed and started to yell at me that we spent one and half hour in a call and hanged up on me. I texted him and said let's be on good terms, and he was very cold and rejecting, he said good night and refused to continue the conversation. He didn't contact me for two days after (stonewalling), which again made me think, that's not how you behave to someone you love.  He also had said he doesn't necessarily look forward to speaking because I complained about our lack of time together, but I wouldn't have, if that was an issue in the first place. I dropped any complaining since, but his effort fluctuates and doesn't seem more than before, overall. He seemed to be more talkative and have a bit more initiative, like a few texts in a day and some short calls, of 5 and 10 min the last days, but he was also stressed out because he had an exam. \n\nThe night before the exam, we had a talk, where he was asking me to be submissive and obedient from time to time, and say/agree to things he says and that he wanted to feel like I was his property. He is in the army and he is above some newbies (he was one 4 months ago), and basically wanted me to pretend like I was one of his subordinates and he can boss me. It's not the first time he talks about wanting submissiveness from me, where I have to just agree and go along with what he says.  \n\nI dislike that and it sounds to me like some speech from the 1800. And when I said I am his gf not subordinate, he told me that I am older than him and he should not have to teach me to be a good gf, and that a smart woman would play along like that and have a submissive attitude and get favors through that. I told him he should respect who I am as a person and appreciate me, because at the end of the day, I wouldn't be anymore the person he fell in love with. That that makes me feel diminished and that no guy has ever asked that of me. Looks like I had to let some things out of my system before getting to the point I wanted to ask. \n\nOn the 13th of Feb, he told me he knows that Valentine's Day is really important to me and that he wants to get me something and to think of what I wanted. He said the same thing for the following days. At that time I was going to job interviews, travelling between cities, I was really stressed out, and couldn't think of that, but it made me very happy he had this intention, hints from me.\n\nYesterday evening, he was at an internet cafe with his army buddies, gaming. We didn't get to spend and time that day talking, just good morning.  He insisted again on me acting submissive and playing along like I am one of his army inferiors, and I didn't want to, but he seemed more lighthearted about it. I told him I will let him play and we can chat later. He asked me about my day and work, but when I tried to tell, he was distracted by gaming with his buddies. They could most likely hear our conversation. I said let's talk later, he insisted I tell him, but I kept having to repeat myself. I brought up the topic that I had been stressed out and that I hadn't thought of something for him to get me for Valentine's Day, but I can do it now.\n\nHe said it's off the table that it's been some time, and I should have chosen then. I told him I had been stressed and I was not able to think about that. But he continued to repeat that and said what did I get him for Valentine's Day? I felt humiliated that his friends witnessed that. I am not sure how the customs is in other parts of the world, where I am Valentine's Day is mostly about the guy declaring his love and making a woman feel special, by taking her out to dinner, buying flowers, or gifts, etc. That's what I saw around me growing up, and also what I had in my previous relationships, where my boyfriends would get me flowers, cake etc.\n\nI said I'll let him have time with his buddies, and he said he will call me after. He texted me just before bed he was busy and that he loved me and he had to go to sleep. I said I also loved him. I feel very upset and deflated. He said he'd do something, he knew it made me happy and that it was one of the few actions he'd to to make me feel loved and he took that back. What added even more value to it is that he offered without any hints from me. And now I feel unloved. I'd say that my love language, one of the main is gifts. This morning he wished me Happy Women's Day and that was that, no text, no questions. I thanked him for it and didn't say anything else. I'm starting to feel discouraged and fed up.\n\nHe told me days ago he wished I could understand how much he loved me, but then he pulls things like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend said he'd get me something for Valentine's Day, because he knows how important that is to me (gift giving is a love language to me), but because I was stressed and had a lot going on (finding a job and income), I didn't focus on that. When I brought it up now, he says it's too late and it's off the table.  He told me days before he wished I understood how much he loved me, but then behaves like this. I felt happy and hyped up because he suggested it on his own, just to pull it back now.",

        "text": "TLDR - How do you manage support for your baby and spouse or partner when you work from home?\n\nWe have a 5 month old baby that is pretty fussy at times. My wife is on maternity leave and I work from home. I have an office available to me nearby but attendance isn't mandatory.\n\nGiven the unpredictability of our baby it's hard to make any sort of agreement about when I can help out with the baby during work hours. I help support before work (Before 9am), sometimes at lunch and then from 6pm until the baby finally sleeps and sometimes in the middle of the night. I'm basically all in outside of work hours.\n\nMy wife is supportive of the fact I need to work but there are instances where it's not quite clear what should happen. I've always said to my wife that if she is struggling I'll help out, regardless of whether I am working and/or in a meeting, however sometimes it feels like there is an expectation that I should know when to help out and I don't always get this right. Because we live in a small house I can always hear everything.\n\nI work in a job that requires quite a bit of focus, and I've already accepted that my current performance is maybe 50% less than pre-baby. Fortunately this hasn't explicitly been flagged up as a problem yet by management but I can kind of get a sense that I'm being excluded from important discussions and meetings because of it. \n\nThe trouble with attempting to set rigid boundaries is the unpredictability of the baby makes sticking to them difficult. For example if we agree it's okay for me to go to the office for the morning I may go and she has a terrible time with the baby. She copes but it's clear from the stress levels when I get back that it would have helped if I was around. Conversely I might go to the office for half a day, come back expecting to need to offer support only for the baby to be completely blissful. I could have had a full day's concentrated work that wouldn't have negatively impacted my wife.      \n\nThe temptation to point score and play the 'who has it worse' game is really strong. I accept that she probably wins on this front most of the time but sometimes I feel my position isn't being considered as important at all. So far as a couple we've mostly avoided it but we have had the occasional blow up. In those instances it has been 'I need some time to focus on work to continue to provide for this family' vs her being with the baby more than me and all the stresses that come with that.   \n\nI don't know how much of an arse this post will make me seem from just one point of view but I can assure you I am a very active parent and we are both doing well coping with a colicky baby. It's our first and probably only child given our age.",

She was hesitant at first when I asked her to go out but then after few tries she agreed to go on few dates. I found out that she's in a relationship with her girl bestfriend but long distance of 8 years. She said they weren't in good terms. I know I should've backed out but I felt like it was too late for me.  \n\nEventually, her girl bestfriend found out about us and she forgave us and that we should stop our relationship. She then chose her over me and that she felt sorry. But after few days, she contacted me saying she's inlove with me already and that they will just stay bestfriends and not as a lover. She felt really sorry for her because she cheated on her and decided not to give her time to move on. She said she cannot leave her alone as it was her fault and that she will help her to move on. I was against it but I couldn't do anything as she said if I cannot accept her not leaving her bestfriend, then our relationship won't work. I tried to befriend her bestfriend but she said she doesn't want to and that if ever we're gonna get married, she won't attend our wedding.\n\n2 years have been passed and it's been 1 year that we're now living together. I know they still communicate like they both update each other everyday. I know shes hiding me from her because she said she doesn't need to know about us, saying she was the one who got hurt the most. For instance, her bestfriend doesn't know I live with her or when we went on holidays.\n \nI know that friendship is very important and not easily to be thrown away. But it seems like I'm becoming a 2nd in priorities. \n\nIt feels like she's very comfortable about me being around as we live together and doesn't put as much as effort as me. She's always on the phone whenever she comes home from work and she said it's a way for her to relax. \n\nit feels like if we ever break up, they're just gonna be back together so Im feeling she's not that afraid to lose me.\n\nTLDR: girlfriend used to have a girl lover of 8 years and decided to be with me but they stayed as bestfriend, yet they still update each other and feels like I'm 2nd option.",

On top of this, he maintained regular contact with a girl who made it very obvious she wanted to get in his pants, which I said I was uncomfortable with but he eventually dropped her. Before being with my boyfriend, my supposed group of friends started bullying me behind my back and spreading rumours, which I believe started my trust issues; I didn't have a problem trusting my boyfriend when I got with him, however I unfortunately have difficulty trusting him after all this.\n\nThe main issue: about a year ago, he went out drinking with some mutual friends while I stayed in doing an essay. I didn't see it at the time, but a girl there posted pictures with him, tagging him with the caption \"feeling like a princess with (boyfriend's name) \\*heart emojis\\*\". In the picture it looked like she was sitting on his lap and they were about to kiss. Obviously this caused a major argument and I almost broke up with him because I thought something happened between them, but he kept insisting nothing happened, and she wasn't on his lap, it was just the weird camera angle. He isn't the type of person to lie, but since he has a history of hiding things from me for so long I find it so difficult to trust him. I want to believe him, but I don't and can't. She knows we were together, at some point in the night he facetimed me drunk and she took his phone to talk to me a bit, but my main issue is why would she then post all that if nothing truly happened between them?\n\nHe keeps insisting so strongly that nothing happened, I don't know what to believe.\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend mistrust, been together 2 years.",

He said he'd return to me by this weekend after therapy but told me today that he thinks we should get a divorce.\n\nHe said he loves and wants to be with me, but he doesn't want to think about other people when making decisions. He doesn't know who he is or what he wants from life. He wants to be himself as when he thinks about his future it's alone and by himself. He said he just doesn't want to waste my time anymore.\n\nI've expressed I'm hearing he wants space, but I'm not hearing a divorce so why is he trying to get one? I told him I can give him space, so why leave? I told him he was making a rash decision, to please see the therapist, and then come back to me. He said he's not a walking diagnostic and that his decision is his. But then in the same breath says he should've killed himself months ago. I truly believe he's just that far gone into his depression.....After breaking into spiels like \"I    should've killed myself a while ago,\" and \"Here we go again, me doing    things for other people\", he apologized and said he will go to therapy,    but he doesn't think he'll change his mind. He said any answer he gives after it, is final.\n\nBefore we left, we had angry sex 🤷🏾‍♀️ -- Probably shouldn't have...but I  missed him and he missed me...we've been both sleeping terribly w/o each other and because of his depression, he's been refusing to sleep w/me  for months. We did it understanding nothing had changed...\n\nIn any case, I have very little faith he'll have an epiphany this weekend with therapy, apologize, and change his mind about divorcing...so, I ask how do I prepare for divorce and pick up my life after?\n\nI stupidly have some faith and hope it'll click, but doubt it so want to prepare...  \n\n\nTL;DR -- Husband is extremely depressed to the point where it's really concerning and asked to separate. Expressed he doesn't want to leave me but feels I'm better off with someone else. Asked him to go to therapy and let me know if he's still adamant this weekend. Am I prolonging the inevitable and how do I prepare?",

We broke up because of my insecurities spiralling due to that whole situation. \n\nI just feel like if i wasn’t insecure everything would be fine and I regret breaking up with him. My insecurities have gotten the worst it’s ever been and my acne hasn’t been making it any better.

He said that our circumstances weren’t right, the timing with my life and his life were different and that for this moment of time that decision is right for the both of us. then he says that maybe in months time that circumstance and instances might change and that he can’t make promises but he will check up on us in 5-6 months. these words are making me so delusional in thinking I should wait for him and try my best on myself so I can get back with him when the time is “right”. \nHow do I seriously stop this obsessive and delusional thought pattern. I don’t have many friends and i wish i had an older female influence in my life so I can learn my self worth. \n\nI’m not ugly and i’ve been told time and time again that i’m very physically attractive and i do know that, but why, why can’t i see myself as the pretty girl everyone says they see me as. it hurts\n\nTheoretically speaking if I were able to overcome my crippling insecurities and he’s changed would we still have a chance together? \n\nTLDR \nbroke up with ldr bf bc of my insecurities that have gotten worse due to him emotionally cheating one me. He says he loves me and says that circumstances and timing isn’t right and that maybe in a few month it might be right and that he will check up on me in 5-6 months. False hope is giving me delusional thoughts\n\nIf anyone could talk to me please I would appreciate it. I’ve never felt this terrible and alone in my life.",

        "text": "I (30F) is in a relationship for about 5 months with my boyfriend (28M) and I want to know if there is a key to building strong trust on your partner.\n\nMy partner is a very friendly persons and makes and has quite a bit of female friends. In the span of our relationship he has developed friendship with two new females and they are now my friends as well. But since they are more comfortable/started their friendship first with my partner, they are more friendly with him and it bothers me sometimes. I have talked to my partner about it and he has assured me that there is nothing to worry about. For instance, today itself we were all sitting for some dinner and my partner went to get some drink for himself. One of the female friends asked us for him and went to him while saying I will see what's taking him so long. Also, when us three are there she engages in conversation which is common for both of them and I feel left out (they both worked and grew up in the same city)\n\nI am not denying I have some trust issues and that I am aware of my separation anxiety disorder so I am looking into ways to build more trust on my partner. \n\nTldr: How should I build more trust on my partner and not worry about his female friends.",

My boyfriend was very mad and went home and blocked R. And I was also furious at R she knows my boyfriend is dating me and she proceeded to say all this thing.  \n\nShe’s honestly a messed up person  because R is also my friend’s ex, and B became my friends with my friend as well. And R and B have been having sex. On top of that B has a boyfriend as well. B and R have been having sex for a couple of months idk if all these happened  while R was dating my friend. And after all this this R has the audacity to tell people that my boyfriend likes R and when she knows my boyfriend is dating me. \n\nI was very mad at R and my friends and even my boyfriend’s other  friends told me to confront R and ask her why she did that. I went to confront R and she keeps saying is that’s a joke and it happens between every friend group and everyone knows she was joking??? Is this even a joke to make??  And she said my boyfriend was also ok with it but then my boyfriend cursed her and left.  R also said if my boyfriend said he didn’t like it she’d stop but I doubt it lol.  I feel  really disrespected as well. Because R knows me and my boyfriend and are together but she went on to make a joke like this and say this to my boyfriend’s classmate. \n\nAnd also another thing to add I was thinking about this lately and I wondered what made her say this then i realised, my  boyfriend and B are very touchy and they “play fights”. Even infront of me they’d be very touchy and have their very own private jokes and maybe this what compelled R to make these jokes? B and my boyfriend also met up alone a couple of times.  B has a boyfriend as well. I told my my boyfriend I’m not comfortable with B touching him and playing fights with him but he keeps telling me it’s shit between friends. \n\nI feel hurt and disrespected. I want to end this relationship. I was willing to fight for this relationship but now I feel like it’s not worth it what should i do? Should I break up with my boyfriend? \n\nTDLR: my boyfriend’s friend told my boyfriend’s classmate that he likes his other friend. \n\nNote:And also so sorry for any grammatical errors my first language is Spanish not English.",

In school I had plenty of friends, dated throughout HS of course, and am relatively well known. After HS I went about 20 hours away on a sports scholarship for a year until injury brought me back. While there me and my girlfriend or 2 years split and I started losing contact with a lot of friends. Everyone loses most their HS friends after graduation which I get and is normal, but after coming back is when the issue started. Also, anyone that has lived in a small town knows it is clicky and at this point in my life everyone has their groups they hang out with so I’m an odd ball out. And the females at this age are either engaged with a kid with the person they’ve been with since high school or at clubs every night. \n\nHowever, since college, that has been my last intimate relationship with a female and I consider myself to have 2 friends that I hang out with, one of which I grew up with has been with his now fiancé for 6 years and the other never comes out the house. They never want to do anything or don’t have time and it seems like I’m always texting them to try and hang out and never get invited to anything they do. Hobby wise there’s 1 gym here and I go to it and see/talk to a lot of people I know but it’s no one I hang out with (again small town clicks). I also like to golf and fish and even just bought a brand new boat. I’ve tried hanging out with guys from the gym but again it’s always me wanting to hang out and I get burnt out being the one always trying to do something after so long. I also work about 240-250 hours a month so it isn’t like I hound them daily to hang out or anything like that. Building an intimate relationship has been a whole other issue, I don’t really drink so never got into the bars or anything like that, I’ve tried all the dating apps with but nothing ever works on there. The longest time I’ve spent with a female has been a month since my last relationship 4 goin on 5 years ago. I’m also not into this hook up culture so I’ve also only been intimate once since then. \n\nSorry if I made it long but any advice would be appreciated. I just don’t get it because I’m not socially awkward, I’m relatively attractive, I’m athletic and outgoing, I make good money, I own my house, own 2 paid off vehicles, own a boat, and am a loyal partner.\n\nTL;DR - Can’t find new friends or relationships",

She typically keeps herself to herself, and she is very trustworthy, though I do still let my past get the better of me sometimes and check her Instagram following count here and there.\n\nAnd mostly for no reason too. She'd literally followed one guy in the year I'd known her, and she even mentioned him casually a few times. I met him on her accord after a couple of months and it's clear they're only friends.\n\nToday I noticed she'd finally followed another new guy. Somebody from her home town. That's all I know about it. I feel bad for checking for months and months on end with literally no signs of another guy and still deciding to keep checking anyway. Now I've got what I asked for I guess. Her never following guys was a green flag and now she's actually followed somebody it makes me think it must be somebody she's actually into because it's so rare for her to follow a guy.\n\nSo what would you advise I do going forward? Nothing to worry about for starters? And then to deal with my insecurities from there? Or any other thoughts?\n\n**TL;DR: girlfriend followed a new guy on Instagram. The first one in ages, yet I still feel anxious about it. How do I deal with this insecurity?**",

        "text": "I’ve been in a relationship with this girl for 2 and a half months now. After a rocky start, we were finally starting to adjust to each other. We both are studying. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that she never initiated anything, and told me that she didn’t need to see me more than once a week. I always planned everything for us. But I just thought that would change with time. She is my first girlfriend. I love her so much. \nLast week, we both got into stressful situations. We were both starting our college years. \nI was really stressed about it, and for 2 days, I got really annoying with her. I was scared that she would leave me for her college experience. I started petty fights over text, only because she wouldn’t answer me for 2 hours, or because she said something that I misunderstood. That resulted in me saying to her that she didn’t put any effort in the relationship two times, and I told her to leave me if she wasn’t happy with me. I made her cry two times. After that, I realized that she wasn’t responsible for my stressful state, and I realized I was being a dick. I apologized a lot and told her I had messed up and that I would like her to tell me what she would like to change between us. She told me nothing and I gave her space, and we called after that. 2 days went by, and she met her roommate. She was being a bit distant, but I just assumed that she was tired because of all the preparation and the period she was going through. Then she canceled plans we had to be with her roommate. Usually I wouldn’t mind, but she had already cancelled something we had, and she told me she didn’t want to leave her alone, but I couldn’t understand why she couldn’t find time for me in the span of one full week. This triggered my fear, and I got a bit upset, and went to bed. The next day, I apologized but she told me she wanted to visit the city first with her instead of me. So I acted a bit distant and we met at night. I told her I didn’t understand why I was putting all the efforts in the relationship. She told me she didn’t understand why I needed to see her so much. I told her it’s been a week we hadn’t seen each other and that I loved her. She told me we argued too much and cried. I told her it was necessary and I tried to reassure her. Then she blew up. She told me I was toxic and controlling, that I wasn’t a priority, that she needed space, that she wanted to enjoy her life and didn’t want us to sacrifice things for each other. She told me she wanted to party and didn’t want me to interfere. She said she didn’t want to see me more than once per week ( we lived next to each other) and only the weekends, after her parties. She then compared our relationship with her best friend’s. She said that I was pressuring her just like her ex. I was really hurt by that and i started to cry because I was really trying to make her happy and she wasn’t. She then asked me if I had come study next to her to be with her. I told her yes, partly. She told me that she was stressed by it. And just told her I didn’t know what she expected from me. She said she wouldn’t have minded a long distance relationship, that my presence was pressuring her, and that she didn’t want for us to make compromises for each other. I felt really bad and just told her to breakup with me, to find someone better than me. and that we weren’t meant for each other. \nNext day I apologized and promised to give her everything she wanted from me. She said she needed time and didn’t  know if she could forgive me. I gave her space but tried to be myself and still give her my love even if she didn’t reciprocate. Yesterday night I called her, 3 days after our fight. It was our first fight face to face, other were dumb arguments over text. I tried to talk to her about our fight so we could fix it and move on and grow from it. She blew up and said i wasn’t able to give her space and that i was pressuring her. She then canceled plans we had so she could go party with her new friends. She told me we could see each other after three weeks. I told her that was unfair and she told me i was egoist. \nI really love her and know I messed up, but it’s really hurting me and i don’t know how to fix things. She’s my first gf and even though i know i’m far from being perfect , i’m trying my best to love her. Any ideas so she can forgive me ? My friends say she is really treating me like shit and i should move on but i don’t really know. \n\nTLDR : My girlfriend doesn’t want to see me anymore more after our first arguments",

        "text": "This is a throwaway account. Sorry for any spelling errors;English is not my first language. My boyfriend (18) and I(18 F) just started college and have been dating for less than a year. I have always been a people pleaser and often ignored the things that bothered me about him, but lately, it's getting hard to ignore them as the issues are getting severely worst. I feel like he doesn't even do the bare minimum in the relationship, such as l'm the one who pays on our dates and buys him gifts, and I'm the one to always contact him. However, he only calls me at night as he is too 'busy' during the day, takes too much time to reply to my texts, and barely makes time for me even though l'm aware of his full schedule. I'm the one who always has to change my schedule to see him, and I'm the one who plans all of our activities doesn't matter if they are outdoor dates or just staying indoors. I would just like to add that I am aware that not everyone's way of showing affection is gift-giving, and I'm also aware that he is financially well off to buy me presents. The only time he got me a gift was at Christmas, too, when I asked him to get me something. We are in a long-distance relationship, yet he still makes excuses not to hang out with me even though we only get to see each other twice or thrice a month.\nAs I said, we have been dating for less than a year now, and none of his friends or family know about the fact that I'm his girlfriend. He told me he will tell his family about our relationship if they asked about us and that he likes to keep things private. Still, a couple of months later, he changed the narrative to that they would like me if they knew we were dating, but he is the one who's not ready to tell them about us. Also, whenever we get into any sort of argument, he always plays the victim and sends me texts of him crying and asking me if I was going to break up with him. Every time he wants something, he makes it sound like it's a requirement for 'us' as if it's something we need instead of it being something related to his personal needs; for example- he always puts his sexual needs first instead of looking out for both of us, and he knows it's not doing anything for me. Yet, he still asks me to help him get off every day. I like to just hang out and talk about our day, but he gives me an ultimatum: I either help him jerk off, or he goes to sleep. He has no interest in simply talking to him.\nHe refers to me as if l'm breaking stereotypes in our relationship, but I think it's just because he likes that I care for him. I'm making this post because a few days ago, on one of our calls, he asked me if I wanted to marry him, and I was so confused. I asked him if he was joking, and he didn't give me a clear answer, so I laughed it off, but I'm still unsure if he was serious or just kidding. He's also not the type to joke about such things, so l'm trying to figure out what he intended by that question.\nIn the end, when I look at our relationship's contents, there are more cons than pros, especially for me, considering that he has no opinion on most things. I'm not the most talkative person and not that good at conveying my feelings, but I still try to get my message across during our banter, but he still doesn't get it. I have talked to my friends - both guys and girls - and they all told me to break up with him. So I'm just conflicted about this whole thing.\n\nTL;DR!- boyfriend manipulate me and  doesn’t even do the bare minimum in the relationship neither does he match my efforts to actually make it work. Should I talk things out with him or breakup with him like everyone is telling me to ?",
