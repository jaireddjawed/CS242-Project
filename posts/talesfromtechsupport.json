So I wanted to share! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a good friend who had a pop-up coffee shop for a while now, with several employees and all that; he is a great barista. He rented a space downtown which he wanted to be his most prominent Coffee spot, the next step up. He struggled quite a lot at first, and people rarely stayed even though it looks incredible and is comfy.\n\nI suggested he'd set up a media server. Maybe if you add more \"ambiance,\" it would help. His only objection was the price, so I offered to set him one up with a raspberry pie I had lying around. I took an hours-long \"coffee shop ambiance\" background noise and put that really quietly behind the music he figured they should play.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's been running for a few weeks, and he says it really makes a difference. People come and stay, some study, others hang out with friends, and so forth. Ordering several coffees and cakes and whatnot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's only babbling in the background no real conversations, but now he got the idea of playing around with the ambiance more than just \"people chatting and jazz music.\" We'll see how it goes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suggested making a Lord of the rings Lofi backdrop, but that's only because it's my favorite.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678634839.0},{"title":"I need bigger emails","author":"frank_Blitz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/11od8tk\/i_need_bigger_emails\/","text":"I work for a tech company with a contract for a big, scary government agency. We manage multiple systems at lvl 1 and triage escalations to other contractors for higher support for tens of thousands of users across the country. My calls can range from \"I forgot my password\" and \"Skype can't find my camera\" to troubleshooting backscatter x-ray rigs, \"The wifi on \\[XXXX Ship in the Pacific Ocean XXXX\\] can't connect to the VPN,\" and configuring air traffic control tower access.\n\nAt least once a week, I get calls from civil servants who forget where they work. This one was the latest.\n\nI had just finished raising at ticket to external troubleshooters about something serious, one where I had to call through to their management because it would affect industries in that part of the country for the next 72 hours. The moment I was halting my phone after to take lunch, I get a call from a mid-tier dumbass, let's call him DACS  \n\n\n>DACS: I need bigger email  \n>  \n>FB: Excuse me?  \n>  \n>DACS: I *need* bigger email because I need to send so many important reports and documents, and they're just so big they won't send  \n>  \n>FB: OK. How big are these emails?  \n>  \n>DACS: *I don't know* they're just clearly too big, and you know, it would be **nice** if I could send them all at once because...(3-minute story about whatever he was working on)\n\nDuring that time, I checked his account for locks and holds, any recent issues with the message exchange. It all came up clean.   \nSo, just for fun, I looked him up in the internal directory. \n\nHe came up flagged as one of the kids in a graduate program - I'd seen them before: they get hired at a higher salary entry level with some extra individual responsibility, then after 2 years, they automatically get promoted to management of a small team... without any greater responsibilities.  \n\n\n>FB: (After he finished the story) Alright, I can see that that's very important. But, how big was the *last* email you sent?  \n>  \n>DACS: \\*sigh followed by silent beat\\* 22MB and that's a small one  \n>  \n>FB: The agency-wide mail send limit is 26MB. No one can send any emails bigger than that.\n\nBut something smelt fishy, so I remoted into his machine.\n\nSure enough there was the email with a 22MB spreadsheet attached... and a 13MB PDF, and 15MB document. He also had a signature block which used chunky external fonts and a *full resolution banner*. A blank email was about 5MB for this guy.  \n\n\n>FB: \\*Waving the cursor around the attachments\\* You're not allowed to do this. You need to send each of these as separate emails  \n>  \n>DACS: I told you I need to send them all at once because they're really important, and they're already late because Lookout kept crashing when I'd send them one-by-one  \n>  \n>FB:...What?  \n>  \n>DACS: I need to send all of my files for each--  \n>  \n>FB: No. The part about Lookout crashing  \n>  \n>DACS: *Yeah* it's been happening for weeks, you should know about it. Every time I attach something to an email, it crashes when I send it\n\n  \nThis was exactly what had been happening during an **agency-wide incident** about a month before. Every branch was given instructions on how to resolve it, and every civil servant was expected to follow these instructions within 48 hours of it going out.\n\nSo, while still remoted in, I search for the email and there it was - it was unread.\n\n>FB: \\*With the email open\\* If you'd have followed this 4 weeks ago, you wouldn't be having this problem'  \n>  \n>DACS: I don't read *general* mail. I figured one of you would come fix it eventually.\n\n  \n\\*CYA Mode Engaged\\*   \nI made sure to include this exchange and the fact he refused to do the fix for weeks in my ticket under the non-public notes for managers and other techs\n\nThen I took him through the 15-minute process of doing the fix, where I was interrupted by the following exchange --twice!\n\n>DACS: So, when this is finished, I'll be able to send bigger emails, right?  \n>  \n>FB: We'll get to that. But, I'm sure you can agree, that to send **big emails** you need to be able to send emails at all, right?\n\n  \nWhen I sent him on his way, he still didn't understand the issue with the mail send size. Even after putting him on to the secure file transfer portal specifically for agents like him sending sensitive files to external actors, he kept asking me about what it had to do with giving him more email space.\n\nThat particular civil servant never finished the graduate program, and had an unexceptional career without promotion in the service, moving to another agency shortly after this call.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678517668.0},{"title":"My IE is kinda slow","author":"emmjaybeeyoukay","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/11ob0it\/my_ie_is_kinda_slow\/","text":"Way back before Y2K I was working for an MSP. One of our customers was complaining that their receptionist PC was slow and I got tapped to venture out past the M25 (London Orbital motorway) and deal with it.\n\nYou'll remember how a lot of web sites and dial-ups would have their own menu bar that could integrate into early versions of IE. Usually from ISPs with extra functions for their clients. Well other companies got into the habit of doing this. You could have them stacked.\n\nA full 50% of the IE display was full of these extra menus. Got rid of most of them and then dug deeper.\n\nPopups. Popups galore. Most of them just annoying, some of them insidious and resistive to removal except when using dark arts. \n\nThen we get down and find that the person likes Christmas Tree Lights resident that stays there. Remove that. \n\nThen we get down into the fun of their mailbox. This was Outlook Express. They have kept every single email. The mailbox is called reception and its got years of history .. all of it \"vital\" to the business (yet strangely not backed up).\n\nIn the end we built receptionist a new workstation, had to do a major bit of mailboxfix work archiving out old mail and then locking the entire environment down along with a backup.

Turns out one of the other regulars is making some fairly audibly frustrated noises at the jukebox.\n\nNaturally, because now I'm curious and wondering if whatever it is I can get some being visibly entertained by his pain out of it, I amble over to his side to see what's up.\n\nThe select a song from a previously chosen artist menu he's on is, to use the technical term, going fucking batshit.\n\nMore precisely, it's moving down through the available selections without any human interference whatsoever, and while hitting up does indeed make it go up, once, it then returns to its endless march downwards.\n\nThis is not, of course, entirely compatible with the desire to select a specific song.\n\nWorse still, it's evident that he put in money for multiple songs' worth of credits and has already selected several, so simply rebooting the bedamned contraption is going to have to be the last resort rather than the first.\n\n\"Mind if I have a go?\"\n\n\"Be my guest.\"\n\n(I think ... I may have gone in to troubleshooting mode enough to have just reached past him, but either way he figured I was his last, best hope of getting the rest of the songs he wanted -and- retaining the ones he'd already selected)\n\nSo, step zero, let's try a softer form of turning it off and on again.\n\nI fast tap the \"back to browse\" button or whatever it was called until it bounces us back out to the artist selection screen.\n\nThe selected item ... sits there.\n\nBonzer.\n\nBack into the song selection screen.\n\n[fx: down down down down down down down down]\n\nAh.\n\nOK, so, that didn't exactly work but it's a clue. I'm not exactly glaring at the screen at this point but I am staring at it with the sort of intensity that provides anybody with a clue with a strong hint that interrupting me at this moment is going to be at least one of futile and intensely annoying.\n\nMy friend does, indeed, have a clue. He remains silent.\n\nThings we know:\n\nOn the song select screen, the down operation is happening on repeat.\n\nThe GUI loop isn't completely FUBAR, or hitting up wouldn't've worked and most likely neither would've the go back button.\n\nThe artist selection screen is just fine, thank you very much, so it's not that down has got somehow locked in entirely globally.\n\nGlobally?\n\nOh dear.\n\nSee, the thing here is that this is a cheap-arse unit, and while the hardware is ... serviceable enough to sound fine through the pub's honestly not terrible speakers, at least ... it's fairly safe to assume that the software was treated as a cost centre.\n\nWhat if ... and at this point I'm imagining the output of a remedial java class here ... what if there's only actually one set of state for this screen, so going back into it for whatever reason re-uses that and probably nobody ever thought to reset it first?\n\nAnd if it was cheapest development bid time ... what if the underlying framework is more point and click than waft and tap?\n\nWhich means we're not thinking about code that detects \"tap\" for \"scroll down once\" and \"tap and hold\" for \"keep scrolling\" ... so much as code that follows the desktop concept of \"on mouse down\" and \"on mouse up\", and the button's code does something like:\n\n    function onMouseDown () { going_down = true }\n    function onMouseUp () { going_down = false }\n\nand then the loop that's running the screen overall checks that to see if it should keep going down?\n\nAnd it's a one-value-in-the-program sort of global because only one of a given screen can be shown at once?\n\nAnd somehow it got the 'down' event as my friend tapped the button, but missed the 'up' event as his finger lifted back of it?\n\nFits the available data, certainly ... and if that's true then all we really need is to ensure it gets -an- up event, and balance will be restored to the farce.\n\nI duly jab the -down- button vigorously while thinking DISGORGE YOUR SECRETS, RECALCITRANT MACHINE SPIRIT.\n\nThe menu stays put.\n\nI wait while my friend selects a song, then goes back up a level, selects another artist, and selects another song.\n\nThe menu stays put.\n\nMy diagnosis of the underlying problem may, of course, have been lacking, but it appears that the remediation step it rendered has, in fact, worked.\n\nClose enough.\n\nI grin at my mate, receive a thank you whose accompanying grin absolutely encompasses his entirely correct assumption that I enjoyed doing that anyway, and wander back to my pint and book while he returns to finishing picking tracks.\n\nThe track choices he made were, in fact, rather good.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678490572.0},{"title":"A quadruple broken contract is actually impressive","author":"P3chv0gel","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/11nhi76\/a_quadruple_broken_contract_is_actually_impressive\/","text":"So i'm working in govermental service and we have a service Agreement with another goverment agency (we are a state agency, and them a newly formed federal Agency, so we provide support for them until their IT gets up and running, which hasn't happened for 2 years now...) and everytime, someone from that federal agency calls, we are all annoyed, because they see themself as superior for some reason and nobody likes to get yelled at, so we usually draw matches to figur out,who must answer that call.

For weeks I\u2019ve been devouring TFTS stories like they\u2019re candy (some really addictive, but kinda gross candy). And now, I humbly offer up a story of my own to add to the collection.\n\n**Background**: I\u2019m not in tech support. I\u2019m simply mildly tech-literate, can troubleshoot well, and have a detrimental desire to help people. To keep it as vague as possible, I\u2019m a glorified sales assistant for a large company. I help enter and manage orders for sales people I\u2019m assigned to and often end up fielding tech-related questions since a lot of our sales folks struggle with the many systems we work out of. This wouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem, but anyone who\u2019s worked with salespeople closely knows they can be HUGE divas for literally anything that challenges them. With that in mind, on to the story!\n\n**Cast:**\n\n$Me \u2013 Me\n\n$SP \u2013 Sales Person\n\n$SM \u2013 $SP\u2019s Sales Manager\n\n$MM \u2013 My Manager\n\n$CW \u2013 Co-worker that handled $SP before me\n\n**Story:** I started working with $SP several months ago. $Me, $SP, $SM, and $MM met (virtually since we\u2019re remote) and everything seemed to go well. It was already communicated that I was $SP\u2019s new point of contact, and I was briefed by $CW so this was just a formal introduction. $SP was fine and didn\u2019t talk much, so I felt pretty good and assumed he would be fine to work with (HA).\n\nOnce I started actually working with him, I noticed $SP wasn\u2019t completing basic requirements for orders. One particular sticking point was that he wasn\u2019t tracking the orders he built on our CRM platform correctly (similar to SalesForce but worse). Whenever an order is built, an entry on the CRM platform *has* to be created and it *has* to include an order confirmation sent automatically via email to $SP. This process has been in place for at least a couple of years. $SP has been in his role for over 5 years.\n\nIt\u2019s our second or third meeting, and $MM and $SM were on the call as well. Everything seemed good, and he had new orders coming in. He asked how he should submit orders to me even though we\u2019d covered this in depth via email (and I found out later $CW walked him through the process ***multiple*** ***times***). I re-emphasized for him, in front of $SM and $MM, what he needed to do and even got backup from $MM. He seemed polite, said \u201cOk\u201d and that he\u2019d work on it. Meeting ended.\n\nI got up from my laptop, relieved that I was finally done for the day, until the anxiety-inducing ring of an incoming Team$ call set me back on edge. It was $SP. Less than 5 minutes after we just ended our meeting.

You just need to add that email to the order in the CRM platform.\n\n$SP - \\*stares silently\\* I don\u2019t know how to do that.\n\n$Me \u2013 Ok, well I can help with that. All you need to do is \\*explains how to print to pdf since we can\u2019t save .ost files\\*. Then upload the file to the CRM platform.\n\n(please understand that here is where I made my mistake. I was simply asking too much of him \/s and my manager said later he could just copy\/paste the email in the notes section.

This is all so confusing.\n\n$Me \u2013 Ok, I know it\u2019s a bit tricky so I can walk you through it.\n\n$SP \u2013 Ok.\n\n$Me \u2013 Alright, so first click on \u201cFile\u201d.\n\n$SP - \\*stares at me and doesn\u2019t move his mouse\\* What are you asking me to do?\n\n$Me - \\*repeats myself a bit slower, literally just asking him to click on \u201cFile\u201d in the top left hand corner\\*\n\n$SP - \\*keeps staring and, I sh\\*t you not literally does not move his mouse an inch\\* This is all so complicated I don\u2019t know what you want me to do.\n\n$Me \u2013 \\*exhausted and ready to be sniped if it means getting out of this\\* Look, maybe you should reach out to $SM. I\u2019m trying to help, but she can probably explain it better (and was technically the person responsible for teaching him how to set up an order in the first place).\n\n$SP \u2013 This is all so confusing and I didn\u2019t use to have to do this before! $CW handled all of it for me. **You\u2019re just trying to make my job harder!!**\n\n$Me \u2013 (oh you piece of\u2026.) Like I said, you should reach out to your manager.\n\n$SP \u2013 Yeah I think I should do that.\n\n($SP ends the call abruptly)\n\nI was in shock. I couldn\u2019t believe this man was either a) so unwilling to learn he couldn\u2019t follow simple instructions or b) hellbent on getting me to somehow do his job for him (willing to bet it was the latter). All I could do was log off for the day.\n\n**Epilogue:** I obviously connected with $MM the next day and relayed the exchange. She was shocked and upset he was so rude and said she\u2019d speak with $SM. $MM assured me it was not my responsibility to teach him nor do his work for him. Despite the reassurances, $SP ended up not having to submit his orders correctly for the sake of us just getting the money on the books. Sales people are the collective golden child of the company and tend to get what they want if they complain enough.\n\nAnyways, I needed to get this out as a form of catharsis because guess what? After months of no new orders, he sent one! Not holding my breath, I opened the CRM platform and then immediately closed it. He had not attached the confirmation :)\n\nAll I can think about is how much easier it would be to get Patrick to put his hand on the \\*#$@%#$ lid than deal with this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: fixed some typos and formatting","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678412108.0},{"title":"Basic Tech skills means you can always find a job","author":"dave999dave","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/11mdfvx\/basic_tech_skills_means_you_can_always_find_a_job\/","text":"After almost 15 years I spend part of my time back on the help desk.\n\nI just spent the last 45 minutes trying to walk someone through how to send a document via email.\n\nMost of it was spent saying things like\n\n* \"Where did you download the document?\" \n* \"That is the document itself, we need to know where you downloaded it.\"\n* \"Clicking on that will just re-open the document.\"\n* \"Since you revised it and saved it to the project folder, we need to know where that is.\"\n* \"Now that we know where the document is, we now need to open your email client.\"\n* \"By email client I mean outlook or maybe gmail, whichever one you use.\"\n* \"Sharing the document that way will make it a PDF.

Currently we are packing up some stuff in plastic bins. To make the move easier I've elected to label the bins and then keep a list as to what the label means. Bin \"1\" equals children's toys for example.\n\nSo for labels I was just using duct tape on the side and top of the bin, then marking that with a magic marker. After some thought I figured we couldn't possibly get past 1,000 bins, but we might get past 100 bins. So for the first bin I wrote 001 and then went on from there.

If it does, bin number 12 will be sorted before bin 2. With leading zeroes that problem goes away.\n\n**Wife**: Okay fine, your spreadsheet thingee will work better.

Snapping up a bunch of small POS system vendors who were in financial trouble.  Usually their product wasn't really bad, they had expanded too fast and their management hadn't been able to grow their business without getting into trouble.\n\nAnyway, I was in the support\/service division and suddenly we had a bunch of customers to service, along with a bunch of technicians in cities around the country.  Most of the techs were younger guys, used to working on these small storefront type systems.  But we had a bunch much larger customers being serviced by our more professional group of engineers.  \n\nWe had some overlap in cities and there were various headaches with our \"professional\" guys not wanting to deal with the mom-and-pop customers, and the \"new guy\" technicians who were generally keen, but not experienced or trained on the larger more complex systems.  \n\nAt one point one of our old big customers had a problem, which we were able to remotely diagnose down to a particular large peripheral (external disk drive).  The usual engineer was not available so we sent in The New Guy.  He had strict instructions to Not Do Anything unless he was on the phone with our support specialist, who would walk him through replacing the suspected bad part (a large PCB).\n\nNew Guy was very eager to proceed.  We had shipped in a spare part and he was ready to go.  Support guy walked him through disconnecting the cables from the drive so it could slide out on the rails that mounted it to a rack.  Then remove the cover, so many screws on each side, no problem.  Then New Guy removes the suspected bad PCB, installs the new one, and there's an issue.\n\nHe says the cover won't go back on.  The new PCB is too big, it over hangs the unit by a bit.  Support guy can't figure what New Guy is talking about.  Maybe its the wrong part?  New Guy can't find the part number stenciled on the PCB.  This is before cell phones with cameras, we can't see what New Guy sees.  \n\nNew Guy then offers a solution:\n\n\"Hey, the PCB is only a tiny bit too big, I could get my saber saw and just trim a bit off, and then I could get the cover on!\"\n\nSupport Guy, my boss, and me are all on a speaker phone when he comes up with this.  I laugh out loud, pretty good joke.  Support Guy and Boss join in.  We figure we shipped the wrong part, nothing for it but to send him another.\n\nNew Guy hears us laughing:\n\n\"What's so funny?\"\n\nMe\"  \"Yeah, just trim a piece off the PCB.  Sure that will work!\" (with lots of sarcasm).\n\nNew Guy: \"So do you want me to go get my saw or what?\"\n\nAt this point the three of us realize that New Guy **is not joking**.\n\nSupport Guy hastily tells him, NOT to cut anything!  He's got the wrong part.  Its similar to what is needed, but not identical.  Box the \"wrong\" PCB up and send it back, we'll overnight him the correct part.  \n\nWe get off the phone and we're all like WTF.  He really thought he could just cut the PCB down to make it fit, like it was piece of wood trim for his kitchen cabinets or something.  \n\nAfter this we were way more careful about what we asked the various New Guys to do, it wasn't their fault, they had no training or experience on this other equipment.

This happened some time ago.\n\nWe had temp agency people come in during a big hardware or OS upgrade. Novell to PassGo, Windows 2000 to Windows XP \u2013 Dell to HP back to Dell and then to Lenovo, etc.\n\n**Relevant note**: There was a time when many\/most of our remote users had admin rights so that they could more easily deal with printer drivers, USB drives and stuff like that. This, surprisingly lasted about 4 years, until they pulled the plug with the upgrade to Windows 7.\n\nWe had a lot of homegrown department-specific applications that interfaced with the mainframe in whatever way required for that department to access their portion of the business. Some of it required hands-on configuration.\n\nWe had an OS & Applications image for each of the main departments. Some of those builds were install & go. Others had the base applications installed, but they couldn\u2019t figure out a way to package some of the configurations, so they became hands-on deployments.\n\nTo be fair, there was some validity to the fact that users dreaded any of these big changes. Some percentage of people always had issues post-upgrade. The temps would build and deploy the computers during the evening and us full time would deal with any issues the next morning.\n\nProbably due to the fact that people hated these upgrades, management instituted a 5-star rating system for the deployments to try and figure out what was going on. The full-time techs were responsible for making sure that every deployed person responded to the rating sheet on the general portal. (The results from that were sent to a couple people tasked with collecting the data.)\n\nThings went well for me in general. I\u2019d been there for years and was rarely surprised or stumped by anything that came up in that corporate environment. What DID surprise me and my manager was the 1-star rating that came in from TimJim, complaining that important files were missing.\n\n1-star was obviously abysmal and cause for great concern. I think we\u2019d never seen anything less than 2 and that was super rare.\n\nMy manager and I were told to show up at the IT director\u2019s office at a certain time and we\u2019d call the remote user to see what happened\u2026\n\nWe were in the director\u2019s office on a Polycom.

I see that you\u2019re having problems with important files missing. Can you tell me what application or process is affected by that, or is it missing documents that you\u2019ve created?\n\n**Remote**: (With no hesitation or shame, or whatever): I let my son use the laptop when I\u2019m not working. He plays Battlefield 1942, which saves his progress. When I got this new laptop and reinstalled the game, none of those files were there so he had to start all over again.\n\nI looked at my manager, who I\u2019ve said before was THE best that you could ever want. He stood up, spread out his arms like Jesus addressing the masses, shook his head and motioned for me to follow him out.\n\nSome time later the remote guy\u2019s manager told my manager how sorry he was for all of the trouble and the rating.

This software run on just about every flavour of Unix out there. It consisted of multiple programs that communicated with each other through queues and semaphores. Also, being Unix it was perfectly possible to run multiple copies of the software at the same time. Every now and then the software would crash and you\u2019d have to manually kill all the queues.

The Best Software Ever!","author":"ascii4ever","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/11geblb\/whats_an_audit_trail_the_best_software_ever\/","text":"Another old guy story, apologies for length.\n\nLong, long ago, I was a junior manager in a tech support\/service organization for a mid sized computer company.  We were going through a rapid expansion and our service techs were getting busier and busier.  We had no automated call tracking or parts usage system and it was getting more and more difficult to keep track of everything.  So the various managers got together and decided to ask corporate for permission to purchase a software suite that one of them was familiar with.  None them really knew how programming such a system would work, they were mostly older guys who came out of the old \"hardware is hardware, software is software, and the two don't mix\", environment.\n\nThe vendor for the chosen product was a small company in the area I was based in so a demo was scheduled while all the managers were in town for a meeting.  The owner of the company showed with a portable PC (remember those \"luggable\" computers, looked kind of like a sewing machine in its case?).  So we all gathered around the tiny CRT display built into the PC and the guy demoed his product.\n\nThe vendor had started the product as a cheap system for appliance repair businesses, but it could be adapted easily for computers and peripherals.  It would do everything we needed it to do.  Each piece of customer equipment would be tagged with a unique \"asset number\" by our field techs, who would forward this info to their regional office.  Each office would hire a dispatcher\/receptionist person who would enter all the information.  Each customer could have multiple locations, with a default tech assigned, each location would have a list of all installed equipment, it was going to be great.  \n\nIt took months to get all the data collected and entered, plus our spare parts database had to be created.  We had a large variety of peripherals, each with a separate set of spare parts, plus multiple spare parts locations, so this took a long time as well.\n\nFinally we were ready to go live!  Each office had an IBM XT clone with a 4 way serial card since the OS we were using supported multiple users, so our parts clerks could have a terminal in their stockroom while the PC with the console was at the dispatcher's desk.  The PCs had their standard 5.25 inch floppy drives, which we were to backup each system daily.  (You can imagine how that worked out).\n\nAnd things fell apart from day one.  The \"systems\" were so slow it was not possible enter a service call in real time.  Went something like this:\n\nCustomer calls and says they have a problem to report.\n\nDispatcher switches to the correct menu for entering a call.\n\n(It could take 2-3 seconds to change from one menu to another and there were no short cuts, dispatcher had to exit to the top level, then drill down.)\n\nDispatcher would ask customer for asset number, customer would provide number, dispatcher would enter number.  The systems were so slow that the dispatcher would finish typing in the number before anything displayed on the screen.  If the dispatcher had hit \"enter\" to do the lookup, and there was typo, they system would grind for 10-15 seconds before returning an error.  So the dispatchers got in the habit of entering the numbers, waiting for 10 seconds for the display to refresh, then moving to the next screeen.  Entering the reported problem had the same screen delay issue.  Creating a single service call would take over 3 minutes since each look up or menu change had this 10-15 second delay.  \n\nUsually customers would not call in until they had 4 or 5 calls to open (unless it was an emergency) since they knew they'd be on the phone for a while.  Meanwhile, the dispatcher was getting other calls and having to tell other customers that they'd call them back.  Needless to say customers were ticked off since we had bragged about this system, and now they were on the phone for ages waiting, or being told to call back, or please provide a call back number.  The dispatchers were really frazzled since everyone was getting shirty with them over the amount of time things took.  Our techs were bugged also since they couldn't close a call over the phone since the dispatchers were backed up.\n\nThen entire deal was clearly unworkable.  Dispatchers had to take down service requests *on paper!*  Enter the information offline, call customers back with the call numbers, page the techs to dispatch the calls, sometimes having to have the tech wait on hold while dealt with a customer.  A while bunch of people were wasting a lot of time since we introduced our \"automated\" system.\n\nA bunch of discussion went on above my pay grade, but our corporate MIS team got roped into investigating things.  These guys had experience with the OS we were using since they supported the companies manufacturing system and it ran on the same OS.  They got a copy of the source code from the vendor, who probably had never sold his product to an outfit our size.  Our MIS guys said to pick someone from the service organization to interface with them and they'd fix it if they could.\n\nI got picked to be the \"project manager\" and flew out to the head office to meet with the MIS guys.\n\nFirst off, I got an earful about how the parts tracking system was completely unworkable.  It had no audit function at all.  Parts could be changed from one location to another without any kind of logged transaction.  There was also a \"feature\" than if a parts clerk was looking up an item, and found the quantity available was incorrect, he could use a hot key to drop into a database editor and just change the quantity on the fly.  So the MIS guys basically said they were going to have to re-write a ton of code to make this package comply with basic standards.\n\nThe field service folks were okay with this, no one really understood or cared about the inventory side of the issue, it was the speed issue that was killing us.  The MIS manager just hand waved this issue, it was a hardware problem.  They couldn't re-write the code to make it faster, we had to buy better, faster PCs.  He gave me the contact info for a consult\/integrator for the OS we were using in my home location and just said to call them.  \n\nIt turned out he was correct.  I met with the consultant, they put together a 386 based system with a fancy disk controller for us to test.  I spent a day with them installing a copy of our code and databases and did a side-by-side comparison.   The speed was greatly improved and we now had a solution.   We were up against a classic \"sunk cost\" issue.  We had invested a bunch of money in the code, plus hundreds of hours entering customer data, no one wanted to walk away from that.  So we begged the gods of corporate finance and they allowed us to purchase a total of 5 (I think) systems.  The MIS guys bought an additional system for themselves since had to write and proof all the stuff we were asking them to do.  \n\nThere were a bunch of other tweaks we had to implement to make the system usable but at least we had something that didn't drive people insane. \n\nI learned a very valuable lesson from the entire experience.   No one had actually sat down and written out actual specifications for what we needed.  It was \"we used this product in my last job, and it kind of worked, so let's buy that\".  \n\nAnd don't cheap out on the hardware!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677791830.0},{"title":"I'd be paranoid too if I was this bad at computers","author":"SkyrakerBeyond","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/11g5qvb\/id_be_paranoid_too_if_i_was_this_bad_at_computers\/","text":"This one happened a few years back. A client had ordered a series of upgrades to their office's CCTV system without informing us- their full course MSP, which was always a treat because we actually have in-house vendors to handle that kind of thing so we can ensure the work is up to standard, but this particular client never bothered to follow those directives and just hired randos to install whatever crap they had laying around.   \n\n\nAnyways, we get a call one summer evening about how the service has been installed and set up according to the specifications of the boss lady, who for the purpose of this story I will be calling Winifried. As this is the first time any of us are hearing about an install, I call winifried and she tells me that she wanted to file for an install with us, but couldn't remember her account password. In fact, she hadn't been able to remember her  password for months and had just not been sending in tickets. I get this resolved pretty quick, and move on to ensuring the remote DVR equipment has been installed correctly. Spoilers: It hasn't. the drives aren't formatted correctly, and while the cameras work they can't record anything. \n\nI call the vendor, and they agree to send a tech out to fix it, and I get back to running Winifried through the setup. This system uses an IP-access portal with an admin username and password. The default is admin admin, and part of our standing guidance was DO NOT USE admin admin. So Winifried lets me know she had it changed during the install.\n\nOnce she can access the portal and I show her how the cameras work, she asks me if I can make it impossible to access the remote portal via IP. I let her know that we could take the device off the network or close the portal, but then she wouldn't be able to access it. I would like to know why she wants this.  \n\n\nIt turns out Winifried is terrified her staff are spying on her. She believes they hacked the previous camera system and had ordered the cameras to follow her and report on her activities. That's why she had the previous working system replaced. But she fears the've already hacked the new system which has only been operational for less than a day and wants to know if there's any way she can have access to it while preventing them.   \n\n\nWhich, you know, is he entire purpose of having a password. I ask if she's shared the credentials with them- of course she hasn't. \n\nMe \"I guess you could change the password?\"\n\n\"No way, I'd never remember it. It's already too complex. They're not guessing the password anyways, they're hacking it, I told you.\"\n\nMe, referring to the notes she's shared with us. \"You have it listed here that the password is password.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nMe: \"You know, password is the most obvious password and I will have to advise that you change it. Have you tried a combination of numbers and letters?\"\n\n\"No, that's too complex. Can I just do numbers?\"\n\nMe: \"I suppose...\" \n\n\"Alright, I've got it.

As with most manufacturing companies, a lot of the dull work was automated and controlled by what are called PLCs. Think of them as small computers that control something, like a conveyor belt, or a valve.\n\nUnlike computers however, these things needed to be programmed to do whatever it is that they do. Part of this programming is creating a user interface with buttons and such that do the things you want it to do: press a button to open a valve, press another button to stop production, etc.\n\nThe story:\nAs a general IT guy, I had to work on everything imaginable. One day I get a call saying that a site's PLC will not open a valve to dispense grain to a train car. Normally not a problem, but the site is:\n1. Out in the middle of nowhere\n2. Nobody on site is technically inclined; the nearest IT person of a sort was an electrician that knew how to turn on computers about an hour away.\n3. This had been an issue for over a day and late fees on the train cars had been piling up, as they are having to manually open the valve and calculate the weight of the grain by hand.\n\nSo no bueno. They have already restarted everything and brought in the electrician (at a good bit of $$$) to help look at it. I decide to bring in our PLC guy, and this is where it gets interesting.\n\nWhen you press a button, what happens is that it sends a data bit over to the PLC. The PLC goes, hey, I got this data bit, what do I do now? And looks it up in the programming, then does whatever it is suppose to do. In this case, open a valve, monitor the amount dispensed, then close it.\n\nHOWEVER, whomst ever coded this app set it up in such a way that you needed to press the button AND also let go of the button without moving the mouse for everything to work correctly.\n\nGuess what didn't happen? Guess what took us hours to figure out?\n\nExactly that.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677772689.0},{"title":"Please Mop The Computer","author":"CatFish21sm","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/11gdrfr\/please_mop_the_computer\/","text":"Hey guys, new to this sub just found it today and I fell in love instntly. I have so many stories to share. But I'll start with this one that happened a few months ago one of the funniest things that have ever happened to me since I started working tech support.\n\nSo a little background, I work for a big hospital chain, not going to give the name but its one of the biggest in the US. I work as a level 1 call center rep, so no in person stuff. We have a ticket system where when someone cretes a tech ticket it comes to us, we see if it's an issue that we can resolve, if we can then we do what we are able to, if not then we send it to local to deal with. One of the rules in our organization is that tickets can only be closed by the person who created it. If tech support resovles the issue then it can mark it as resolved and the system will close it automatically. But we can only resolve or escalate. The only exception to the rule is when the person who created it specifically tells us to close it for whatever reason. This is true for ALL levels of support, or it was atleast...\n\nSo with that out of the way lets get to the fun part. I'm working having a normal day and I get a ticket. The customer doesn't call in they just place a ticket on line. It's a busy day and we're super backed up so the ticket was actually placed after mid night the night before. The ticket reads \"please mop the computer.  Ok so I get these from time to time. The janitors skip over a room and someone puts in a tech ticket for a \"general issue\" thinking that \"general issue\" is literally any issue.\n\nI assume that they meant the computer room. Not an issue for tech support. I need to call the originator who created the ticket and request permission to close the ticket. Well too bad, they work graveyard shift they arent in office. Welp nothing I can do, normal procedure demands I escalate to local who can try to get into contact with them in person. Local can't contact them so they escalate aswell. They leave a funny note on the ticket when they escalate something like \"Unable to confirm which computer needs moped. Unable to contact the orriginator. Escalating.\"\n\nAt this point somoene is suppose to review the ticket and assign it to one of the local guys who work that shift. But for some reason they break chain and escaate it aswell. Then they escalate it, and so on and so forth. I'm setting here with the ticket number watching the notes come in laughing my tail off as this ticket slowly turns into an office meme with every level of tech support escalating it with another inside joke or crummy IT pun.  And there are like 5 differnt people viewing it at any given time.\n\nThe ticket very quickly reaches national level tech support. The guys who are responsible for systems as a whole. Well guess what? They leave a joke \"Unable to mop compuerters. Unable to contact originator. Escalating.\" The ticket blows up with more people watching it than there are notes on it at this point, it's going viral through the office. Eventually it lands in the cue of he highest level tech support guy in the entire organization. This guy sees it and just adds a message \"Mop has been located. Unable to locate computer that needs mopping. Escalating.\"\n\nThe ticket ended up in the hands of the ONLY person that that guy can escalate to. The CEO fo the entire organization. They apparantly didn't find it as funny  as everyone else did. Unfortunately since they weren't even tech support, they didn't have the access needed to close a ticket. But if they didn't get it closed then it would send them constant reminders to their inbox to review it.\n\nI can't tell exactly what happened at this point as the notes weren't 100% clear. CEO needs to learn how to leave better notes. But from what I could read it looked like the head of IT got chewed out for sending it to them, then it got sent to the head manager at the orriginators hospital. Who also was not IT and also couldn't close it. And for some odd reason he didn't have access to transfer the ticket to IT either. It was stuck. So he had to call the originator while they were sleeping have them drive in office and close the ticket to stop sending him emails.\n\nThere is now a note in the ticket system that reads \"This system is for processing IT tickets only. Janitorial issues should be referred to your supervisor or chieff of staff.\" They also changed the policy about cosing out tickets. We still aren't allowed to but anyone at the T2 level (local) or higher can close a ticket if it is not applicable to our dept.

Well, turns out that he had not unplugged all USB devices yet. He had unplugged almost everything but the mouse, keyboard and an USB hub. It turned out that the USB hub had it's own power supply and was feeding power through the USB port to the computer, but only to the fans and nothing else. Once the USB hub was unplugged the machine started booting normally again.

No pallet truck available, you need to bring one.\nA few hours later we get the call that they will be there in ten minutes and we head down to the loading bay of our office building.\n\nThe \u201cspecialist movers\u201d duly arrive.\n\nIn a standard 3 ton truck with a side door and not even a ramp, let alone a tail lift, with only the driver and his mate on board.\n\nThey pull up the side door of the truck to reveal the delivery, which sits on a standard pallet, and is about 6\u20196\u201d (2m) high with a 3\u20193\u201d (1m) by 5\u2019 (1.5m) footprint and a weight of getting on for 600lbs (300Kg), and look at us expectantly.\n\nA somewhat animated discussion ensued, followed by a heated mobile phone conversation between my boss and the supposed shipping company. As a result of which we were told to wait for some specialist equipment to be sent to facilitate offloading and delivery.\n\nAbout and hour later the \u201cspecialist equipment\u201d arrived which turned out to be half a dozen hefty blokes loaded into the back of a pickup truck.\n\nBy this time we had made a cursory inspection of the shipment and it didn\u2019t look good. All of the \u201ctell tales\u201d attached to it had triggered, indicating that the thing had been bounced around and tipped beyond the shipping and handling specifications, and worse than that the packaging itself showed impact damage. So, knowing that whatever happened from this point onwards was pretty much academic, we settled back to watch the show as these lads tried to figure out how they were going to get this very heavy, very bulky and very fragile object down off the back of the truck and into the building.\n\nSo, they looked around the loading bay to see what was available and found the following: one 12\u2019 scaffolding pole, and one 10\u2019 length of 6\u201dx4\u201d wood. These they proceeded to prop against the truck door as a makeshift ramp.\n\nAt this point my two colleagues and I realised what they were about to attempt and wished that we had a camera to hand.\n\nThey manhandled the server across the truck bed and by dint of rocking it backwards managed to get it onto the top of their makeshift \u201cramp\u201d. They then proceeded to edge it out of the truck door and down the ramp. The 6x4 piece of wood proceeded to bend and creak alarmingly under the load, but by some miracle they managed to get the thing down to ground level without anybody being killed or even seriously injured.\n\nSo what next? As mentioned, they had omitted to bring the much needed pallet truck, and there was no way they were carrying this thing to the goods lift.\n\nOne of the guys went off and borrowed a couple of trolleys from somewhere.\n\nThese were the sort of things that the mail room might use to move small packages weighting s few tens of pounds around. Not the bast part of a half ton of computer, but in for a penny\u2026\n\nAgain by brute force and a lot of tipping they somehow managed to get the thing up and precariously balanced up on these two hopelessly inadequate conveyances, and proceeded to haul the thing in the direction of the goods lift.\n\nThis didn\u2019t go a smoothly as they hoped, as some of the trolley\u2019s wheel bearings gave up their struggle against the laws of physics about half way there, with the result that black streaks of melted plastic from the wheels were left across across the faux marble of the floor as a remembrance of their passage.\n\nOnce we got up to our floor the process was repeated in reverse, with more black plastic witness marks left to puzzle the cleaners.\n\nThen we had to decide what to do with the obviously damaged equipment. Because it was a first installation of a new range of equipment int he country we had a couple of commissioning engineers who had been flow in especially to install the thing, and they had nothing better to do, so they got on the phone to the factory to find out how best to proceed, once they had removed the shipping packaging and assessed the damage: Casing broken. Internal 19\u201d racks distorted. Various mounting bolts sheared. All in all and absolute wreck.\n\nThey vary carefully powered it up, testing for electrical safety at each stage.\n\nIt bloody well worked.\n\nStill had to be scrapped though.\n\nThe replacement was delivered without incident. Which was a pity, because this time I remembered to bring my camera.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677643921.0},{"title":"Setting up an authenticator is not hard. right? ...

The reason why they have to do it while I watch is due to two possibilities, either authenticator is not setup correctly or there is a missing registry key, this time it was the authenticator.\n\nI then tell him to go to a certain website and log in, just to re-activate the authenticator.\n\nThey managed to login to that website with SMS as the MFA choice the first time within like 2 minutes with no help from me, but then we started with the authenticator setup.\n\nDue to how the app is made, you are unable to take screenshots as long as it is open on the phone screen, so I have been unable to make a picture by picture tutorial on how to set it up.\n\nI then take over the computer for a minute to start the setup process, then I message him to follow the instructions shown on the screen.

So, he starts over again, username, password, authenticator\u2026 timeout.\n\nI then messaged them again to retry the login again, and told them to not click on anything with authenticator as a choice, but with SMS as a choice instead. So for the 3rd time, we go through the steps again.\n\nUsername, password, authenticator code\u2026 wtf, that is wrong. I then message him to click on the < button on the top of the white box, he refreshes the page instead\u2026 I then wonder how he never got any problems before now\u2026\n\nSo, we go thru the process again, password, username, authenticator\u2026 I even told him to not choose authenticator OR authenticator codes, but SMS\u2026 the worst part is, I have full keyboard\/mouse access to he\u2019s computer ever since he ran the software, but he never stopped moving the mouse, so I was never able to take over the computer to click on the correct choices. I even tried drawing on the screen to highlight the SMS selection.\n\nThe software does have the choice block user inputs, but requires it to be installed, which we are not supposed to do on any assigned work computers, also requires admin rights to install too, which he does not have.\n\nSo, after like five tries, he finally clicks on the SMS selection, and does nothing. I sent him a message, and he never read it\u2026 I even wrote on the screen to check he\u2019s SMS\u2019s on the phone and nothing\u2026 after like 6 minutes of trying to contact him, he finally enters the code\u2026but its timed out\u2026\n\nThen I got the idea to enlist the one person that is near him right now to help with this issue, and it worked wonders! Finally got back into the website to re-register the authenticator, finally gotten to the part where they are able to scan the QR code, but the phone app\u2026\n\nThey told me that it requires a username and password to unlock, and they did not know the password at all\u2026 and this point, we have used like 2 hours just to get back into the site the second time\u2026 and most of the time was used by him staring at the screen and not reading my messages.\n\nSo, I tried to get an confirmation to reset the password\u2026left on sent\u2026then 10 minutes later I got the message that they needed to go to an meeting\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Fixed an miss wording.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677499567.0},{"title":"Fancy a brew?","author":"omikl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/11d79vr\/fancy_a_brew\/","text":"Or \"More tales from the trenches\"  \n\n\nAs I have previously mentioned, I used to be part of the worldwide support team for a mainframe DBMS product. Well, before that I was a member of the team that supported the \"Office System\" version  of that same DBMS. Broadly the same feature set but on a completely different operating system.  \n\n\nNow the \"Office System\" in question was really a baby mainframe. It was an \"Office System\" because, unlike the real big iron, it could be run in an office environment. It scaled from being capable of supporting amybe 10-12 work stations, up to maybe 100, and could manage the porcessing requirements of, for example, a small factory, or in this case, a brewery.  \n\nNow at one point we had what is known in the trade as a complete self adjusting for all circumstances cock-up of staggering proportions when a maintenance patch relase escaped that contained within it one of those patches that fixed one DB resiliency problem and accidentally intriduced the sort of bug that would quietly corrupt the database without anyone being any the wiser until they attempted the access the afflicted structures.  \n\nI must have spent the better part of 1984 bouncing around the UK patching databases back to a state where they could at least be accessed.  \n\nAnyhow, one such affected customer was a brewery in the North of England, and they had been hit big time. thousands of corruptions that had to be manually patched and muggins here had to do it.  \n\nSo I duly rocked up on site at 9AM on a Monday morning, having travelled up the previous afternoon (Oh paid overtime. Where have you been half of my working life?), and by about 11AM I had patched all of the low hanging fruit and it was time to run the integrity checker again. I hit the \"Enter\" key on the console and the IT Manager looked-over and said \"As that will run for a bit do you fancyt a brew?'  \n\nNow then \"A Brew\" in most parts of the UK refers to tea, so I said \"Yes\".  \n\n\"Follow me\" says that worthy and leads me off through the offices, up a couple of floors to a somewhat spartan room with hard back chairs arrayed around the wall, and a large open cupboard containing a racked-up & tapped beer barrel, and many many pint glasses:  \n\n\"We get unlimited beer but no spirits as we are classed as clerical, the guys on the shop floor get three pints a day and the executives get access to a full wet bar\" says he as he poured me a pint of their best.  \n\nThe security lodge had hand-pumps where the workers got their beer on the morning, lunch, and afternoon breaks, displensed by the security guards.  \n\nYou don't want people to be too pissed when they are driving fork lift trucks after all.  \n\nThe week went past in a blur.  \n\nI remember the IT Manager calling his wife at about 4pm most days to get picked up from the train because he would be too drunk to drive by 7pm. To be honest, I don't know how often his car left the car park.  \n\nAt one point we had reached the stage where there were certain data records that simply couldn't be patched back into the correct structures, so we had to figure out whether ot was worth the effort of even noting their contents before we simply deleted them. Hence \"Crate of empty Guinness bottles\" entered my personal lexicon as the upper bound of \"Worthless\"  \n\nThat particular crate may still sitting in a  Pub Cellar to this day...","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677488643.0},{"title":"The longest wild goose chase","author":"omikl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/11c4wxd\/the_longest_wild_goose_chase\/","text":"As I have said in previous posts, back in the \u201880\u2019s I was a member of the worldwide support team for a mainframe DBMS. As I was the only member who was a childless twenty something I was the one who tended to have to haul ass to customer sites when things got critical.\n\nAs anyone who has done this sort of work will tell you, this is not as fun as it sounds:\n\n\u201cSo how was the South of France at the weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cMarseille airport is a dump. The customer site was on an industrial estate in the middle of nowhere and when I finally got to the motel at 3am I discovered that my camera had been stolen\u201d\n\nWas a typical post-trip exchange.\n\nSo we had this one customer in Hong Kong that due to the specifics of their application seemed to manage to hit every bug harder and faster than everyone else, and because it was a critical system to the point where if there was down time of more than a few minutes the knock on effects tended to make the evening news, when they went down the company paid attention.\n\nOne Wednesday at about 4PM the phone rang. It was Hong Kong and something had gone horribly wrong. One of their key application components just plain wouldn\u2019t run and they needed me there immediately to get it fixed. Well the symptoms of the failure they were getting were a perfect match for a known problem caused by a fault in a run time library belonging to the application development environment, but they insisted that they were patched up to date and that this must be a new problem.\n\nPressure was applied up and down the line and I was duly dispatched on a big paraffin budgie towards the fragrant harbour that following Saturday.\n\nWhen I landed at Kai Tak on Sunday morning I was surprised to be met by an old friend and colleague who had been dragged in from Melbourne on the Friday to provide cover, and who greeted me thus:\n\n\u201cYou were right. They had applied that fix but not in the environment they were running the production job. I figure we fixed it about the same time your plane took off.

I was supposed to be there for a week and packed accordingly. I fixed the problem, or rather the dev team back home did while I did all the evidence collection and initial analysis, but the big suits decided that I should stay until project sign-off in case anything else broke. The net result being that I was there for nearly a month in total, the last two weeks of which I was simply wandering around Hong Kong carrying a pager, and my mangy-arsed collection of clothing went through the hotel laundry a number of times sufficient to generate bills that would have paid for me to replace the lot a couple of times over.\n\nThe expense claim at the end of that one was legendary.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677384483.0},{"title":"I can't print!","author":"randypriest","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/11bmcyu\/i_cant_print\/","text":"A long time ago, when IT support was a mix of procedures, processes and a wild-west of system implementations, a user called the helpdesk while in one of our smallest offices (think 2 desks) and asked for me in particular. \n\nI thought this odd as I'd not dealt with them personally before - but any level of 'odd' on helpdesk would be outdone by the next call anyway, so I didn't raise any red flags back then. Bless my innocence. \n\nThe user explained that they'd submitted a ticket for this issue, but as it was month-end, they needed a bit more urgency. \n\nThey can't print. Can't print from their laptop, can't print from the PC in the office. They need to print one of the reports along with an invoice to a customer. It's urgent. \n\nI run through a few basics, like checking they are printing to the correct printer, etc. And whilst checking my notes, remember that this office is one of the few with a print server still to be decommissioned. \n\nI couldn't ping the printer. \n\nIs it switched on? Blah blah. \n\n>Yes, yes, all working.\n\nI'll have a poke around the server as it also has a domain controller and a few other services that might need checking anyway (no central management, etc. back then). \n\nI couldn't log into it, no response on RDP. \n\nI couldn't ping it. \n\nI couldn't ping the office router. \n\nI ask the user;\n\n>Are you able to access the internet? \n\n>Yes, no issues with that.\n\nOk, strange. Check the VPN server at head office, no connection attempts from that office for a while. Very strange. \n\nI ask if the user can find the mini rack in the corner of the office space to check the router lights through the glass door. \n\nThey respond that they are all green. Weird, that particular router should have at least one red\/orange one. Maybe they were looking at the server or the firewall appliance. \n\nNo, they described the router as I'd expect. \n\nI asked if they could check the lights on the server. \n\n>Erm, let me call you back, just getting another call from a customer... \nClick.\n\nI continue troubleshooting all I could think of, checking last access logs, etc. Nothing was showing any usage for a while, around 3 weeks. \n\nI escalate to my manager as I'll need authorisation to drive the ~600 mile round trip to check in person as nothing is responding remotely and the ISP is reporting no outages, etc. \n\nI had to call the user back to perform a few more checks before being allowed to make the journey, but they were quite abrupt with their answers. Something wasn't right but I put it down to their issues causing knock-on effects on customer relations during a contract renewal, etc. but manage to set a date and time to visit the user at the office in a few days. \n\nI get the authorisation through, book the travel (policy dictated I had to book a hotel if over a certain driving distance) and set off on the drive. \n\nArriving at the office, the user wasn't there. I went to the building reception and went through their security processes, sign in, etc. and get a visitor badge. \n\nScanning the badge on the door, green light, door clicks. I push it open and switch on the light...\n\nWhere are the desks? \n\nWhere are the PCs and monitors?\n\nWhere is the network cabinet? \n\nWhere are the servers? \n\nI call down to reception to check I had the right office. \n\nI call my boss to check I had the right office. I did. Explaining the situation, my boss alerts the user's manager. They pass my boss onto HR...\n\nIt turns out that someone in finance had caught wind of a strange situation with the user's fuel card and opened an investigation. \n\nThe user was filling up with more fuel than their company car could hold (i.e. their fuel tank was 60 litres, but they were claiming 120 - 150 litres a time and *frequently*) and they were found to be filling up their car, their partner's car as well as their daughter's car. Naughty. \n\nSo, dear reader, how does this relate to the user's issue with printing? \n\nWell, as part of the fraud investigations, I was asked for an inventory of the IT stuff at the office. \n\nThis is because the user had been found to have eBayed basically the entire office - fixtures, fittings, IT equipment, the lot - except for the printer. \n\nThe user had thought they could have connected to it directly over the network (just like our more modern printer\/fax\/copiers) and didn't realise this one still had a print server setup. Not to mention that they'd sold the router that created the network as well, so didn't even get that far and called us. \n\nThey asked for me as they knew I'd not dealt with them before and could play dumb with any questions.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677335558.0},{"title":"How Train Simulator became the Bane of my Life.","author":"NewBromance","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/11b22ov\/how_train_simulator_became_the_bane_of_my_life\/","text":"So to preface this I do not work in tech support. There may be many things I do within that could of been solved quicker and more efficiently by a smarter person; but then the story wouldn't be half as long winded and funny. \n\nSo my dad is a retired man who doesnt game much, but when he does he loves to play train simulator, the old age of empire games and surprisingly Colin McCrae Rally. \n\nAbout 2 months ago he told me that he had started getting a weird problem. His PC was randomly blue screening, mostly whilst gaming but not always and the problem was intermittent and sometimes didn't happen for weeks and sometimes multiple times a day. \n\nThis already sounded like my sort of nightmare parent tech support issue but I said I'd help. My only clue was my dad had said that the blue screen mentioned a memory error. This clue ended up being a red herring that lead me down the entirely wrong path. \n\nSo I headed round with some spare ram I had and replaced his RAM. A few days later he called to inform me the crash had happened again. \n\nMy dad also had wanted a bigger hard drive so I decided to get him a new SSD and did a complete reinstall of his system and took his old hard drive out wondering if that was the issue. \n\nI'd gotten my hopes up this had worked because I didn't hear anything from him regarding the PC for nearly 3 weeks. Then it crashed again and I was frustrating back to the drawing board. \n\nEventually my dad was going on holiday for two weeks and I asked him to drop his computer off so I could finally solve this issue. I had to reproduce the error myself I felt because otherwise I just wasn't well educated enough to fix this myself. But if I found out what the error was then Google would be the hero. \n\nSo I took the PC in and loaded up age of empires 2 and got to playing. I played that game for about 3 hours but no crash. Weird. \n\nThe next day I came back and tried some other games on his PC, including his ancient version of Colin McRae Rally which let me tell you is utterly awful to play with a keyboard and mouse. Still no luck. \n\nThis was the moment I'd been trying to avoid. I was going to have to actually play Train Simulator to fix this problem. So I steeled myself for the awful experience that was to come and began to play this cursed game. \n\nI'll spare you the details because man was not meant to endure that tediousness but I'll say that after a couple of hours the PC finally crashed! \n\nYet it didn't crash to a blue screen like I was expecting, it just turned completely off and even more strangely when I turned it back on it immediately turned back off once it got into windows. Immediately I thought something in this PC must be overheating, but that's crazy because I cleaned the fans, heat sink and power supply when I installed the new hard drive. \n\nGetting to work I installed some heat monitoring software and kept it on display on my second monitor and jumped back into train simulator. \n\nIt was during some cursed turn in some Highlands Scottish railroads that I noticed the CPU was starting to get dangerously hot - and sure enough the PC crashed moments later. \n\nBut the fan was working and clean as was the heat sink. I was nervous the cpu was busted or something because that'd be expensive to fix. But I decided to have a look at the processor physically, though I'm not sure why because it's not like you can eye ball a broken processor and diagnose the problem, but I went ahead anyway. \n\nWhen I unscrewed the heat sink I got a strange surprise. There was absolutely zero thermal paste on the CPU. I don't know if there had been and it had like degraded away, or the company my dad had initially bought this PC from years ago just failed to paste it. In any case there was absolutely no paste. \n\nI didn't actually have any paste so I had to wait a day for some to arrive from amazon, but after that I cleaned the processor, pasted it up and put the PC back together. \n\nThat's when it depressingly hit me. I was going to have to play train god damn simulator a final time to see if the problem was fixed. \n\nAfter four hours of train simulator I concluded I had suffered enough and either the problem was fixed or I was giving up. \n\nWhen my dad returned from his holiday I gave him his PC back and told him to keep playing train simulator. He told me recently he's been playing at awful lot and not encountered any issues, so I'm nervously putting this down as solved. \n\nThere's still some mysteries around this that bug me. \n\nWhat was the blue screen my dad saw. Was there actually a memory error I accidentally fixed during all this or did he just get confused? \n\nWhy was it crashing a lot more frequently and in many computer games for my Dad but only train simulator for me? That one I think is because he plays his PC in a roasting hot attic, at least that's the answer that satisfies me. \n\nBut most importantly of all, the biggest mystery that still haunts me, why the hell do people play train simulator.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677272737.0},{"title":"When I\u2019m too nice for my own good when it comes to tech support","author":"tmofee","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/11bje7o\/when_im_too_nice_for_my_own_good_when_it_comes_to\/","text":"Many many years ago, I worked for this big big country that had offices nationwide.

My boss was older, but he picked up the work easily enough. He was a smart guy, but he mostly stuck to the office doing all the boring paperwork and stuff, unless it was busy or it was my days off.\n\nWhile we were doing well, the rest of the state was getting new contractors and the like and the Calldesk was struggling.

If you were lucky they recognised the DBMS name and realised that it was actually one of ours and would at least pass the call on to the right part of\u2026\n\n2nd line: Locally based techs who primarily dealt with the Mainframe OS and installation of upgrades & maintenance releases. As far as the DBMS I worked with, well if we were lucky they had someone around who could spell it.\n\n3rd line: my happy crew. A split team. On site was me who tended to handle fronting the unit to the rest of the company and customers, along with the rest of the unit who were home based colleagues. A total of maybe 10 of us, plus a couple of guys whose job it was to run the regression suite for maintenance releases and recommended base patch levels.\n\nYes. We had home workers even way back then. They used to have to dial in to use the Mainframe and their phone bills were also telephone numbers. \n\nWe were responsible for diagnosing and fixing the software. Fixes being in the form of actual patches. Not wholesale releases of software libraries, actual pieces of assembler-like source code which, by use of a utility specifically developed for this purpose, would be inserted as code snippets into the software libraries on disk.\n\nBelieve me, this was a step up from the previous generation, within which you had to write your patches in assembly language, then hand compile the instructions into their Octal equivalent (24 bit machine) along with place holders and directions as to how to calculate memory addresses &etc. We also sometimes had to send these fixes out by Fax. yes. Fax. The scope for transcription errors was hilarious.\n\nAnyhow. I was talking about the Neolithic, not the Palaeolithic, so\u2026\n\nIf there was something that we couldn\u2019t fix in 3rd Line then it went to the dev team. This only happened if the world was on fire.\n\nThe world was quite often on fire. At one point a particularly understanding customer set in a birthday card for their bug report. \n\nSo one day there was even more of an apocalypse ongoing than usual. \n\nI was about to jump on a plane to go to Hong Kong or somewhere to try to put out a fire, the dev team was up to their eyeballs in backlog and everyone else had at least one \u201cCount the c-suite who are on copy to figure out which on to look at first\u201d bug report on their desks, when \u201cLo!\u201d: Something else went titsup.

We had one system that used to be able to format system memory dumps (stop sniggering at the back there) onto disk and as that system was equipped with a couple of floppy drives (The 9\u201d ones) and the machine had at most 3MB of RAM, these could be sent in rather than 5-10 boxes of fan fold paper.\n\nSo a system on another continent was crashing twice a day and causing some consternation, and it was going to take 24 hours to get someone onto a plane to carry the evidence back up to us. A thought struck me: We had a Worldwide X.25 communications network across which file could be transferred point to point between directly connected machines. It would be possible to get that evidence to us with only two intermediate hops. Surely that would be quicker than a meatsuit sitting on a Jumbo?\n\nNo. no it wasn\u2019t. Even for less than 2MB of data it took well over 18 hours to get that file to the local machine for analysis. It was only an 8 hour flight.\n\nIt could have been worse.

Here goes!\n\nA few times, I offered a desktop computer repair service as a side gig. The computer I was tasked with working on, was one of those miniature desktops that's about the size of an optical disk drive, except a bit wider. A nice cheap machine for basic tasks. The issue was that it wouldn't turn on, and the owners suspected a power supply issue. On these, it's a laptop-style power \"brick\" on the outside, rather than an internal PSU that towers have. Easily replaceable. \n\nNow, normally I could build a dummy load and test the power supply. However, the client already cut open the brick, cut too deep and gouged several traces on the circuit board in the process. (In his defense I probably would have tried the same thing on my own device, even if it were more of a post mortem. Most external power supply \"bricks\" or \"wall warts\" are near-impossible to open without destroying them, or should i say \"bricking\" them, pun intended)\n\nHowever, they still had the back cover of the brick, and the leads going to the barrel plug that powers the computer, were color coded. Great! That means I knew the voltage needed, the polarity and the model of the brick. Thank you for saving those!\n\nI had a bench power supply that was adjustable. This wouldn't have helped much for a tower computer which required multiple different voltages, but it was fine for this, which just had the one pair of wires leading to the barrel plug. There was an extra yellow wire that I never figured out what it was for. I also knew the voltage by the label on the brick (oddly, it wasn't labeled on the computer itself if memory serves)\n\nI matched the voltage on my bench supply exactly to that marked on the brick, confirmed with a multimeter to be sure, and then held my breath and connected it. \n\nProgress! The fan began to spin and the power light came on. Good. The power light was amber, though, and flashing. Maybe not so good? Unless it was unhappy over not having a monitor? Hooked one up and tried again. Nothing on the screen. It was obvious there was still a problem.\n\nI looked up the flash code and it translated to RAM error. Well, I swapped RAMs between the 2 slots, and it still got the same error. Darn. Tried a spare RAM that fit. No dice. I looked up different types of RAM to make sure the one I had on hand was actually compatible. Looks like it should have worked.\n\nOscilloscope time! On the RAM, I can make out a few vias that I can probe with the scope probe. They are facing straight up, mounted similar to the way that a laptop's RAM would be mounted. So this particular job is ironically easier than it would be in a tower computer. Well, I can't find anything that looks active while the computer should be running (i.e. the power light is on \/ flashing). All I can find are steady voltages. This isn't looking good. \n\nIf you've studied computer science or taken such classes, you might remember something called the \"North bridge\" on the motherboard. This is a chip that interfaces between CPU and RAM. What I've discovered with the scope looks like the RAM is not getting anything from the motherboard. So basically, it's looking like a bad motherboard, unless there's a chip that can be easily resoldered.\n\nI stripped everything that was socketed, and find that, what do you know, the CPU is in a socket! That was somewhat unexpected in a mini-desktop, given that they would have wanted to save space and money for a small system. \n\nWith the motherboard out, I can't find a chip close enough to the RAM that it's obviously associated with it (I was hoping for an SMD package with pins on only two sides) so it's probably just a bad motherboard. I was hoping for a voltage regulator in an easily soldered package (There are some SMDs that aren't that hard to work with, but I digress)\n\nWell, I found an online shop that primarily dealt with laptop parts, but also had a few desktop motherboards as well, mostly from mini PCs or all in one computers. Well, they've got the right motherboard, but let me just look up the price of a new computer of this caliber, so I can be transparent with my client about that.\n\nA brand new mini computer of similar specs cost significantly more than just the motherboard (which was actually surprising given that it didn't have a separate GPU nor even a slot for such) so I went to my client with both prices. And also, the price of a new power brick, so he'll be able to plug the computer in properly when it is fixed.\n\nAfter a delay, he authorized me to go ahead, so I bought the new motherboard along with the power brick. The parts arrived and I rebuilt the PC. I pushed the button, and it.... flashes amber in the same pattern. Well fsck. \n\nOkay, so it wasn't the motherboard, the only thing left that could cause a totally blank screen - never mind the supposed RAM error - HAD to be the CPU - The only other thing left was the hard drive and if it were bad, almost all PCs will show something on the screen in that case (unless it shorted, but then it would smell when I tried to turn it on and my bench supply would have gone into protect mode: which also rules out a shorted CPU or RAM) Oh, and there's also a separate WiFi card as well as the front panel I\/O, but again, those wouldn't prevent it from booting.\n\nI sheepishly admitted to my client that I was wrong about the motherboard, and it must be the CPU instead. I found a reasonably priced, used CPU from a seller that had a good reputation. (couldn't get it new as it was an older CPU) I decided that I would try to return the motherboard to the store, and hope they will accept a \"good part, but didn't solve my problem\" return, and if they don't I'll just have to eat the cost. Thankfully, they did accept the return. The client approved the cost of the CPU, and in fact the CPU cost even less than the motherboard did. \n\nThe new CPU arrived, and I redo the whole rigmarole of installing one. With confidence, I hooked up the power brick and Manufacturer's logo appeared on the monitor. Sure enough, it got all the way through booting and asked for a password. Luckily, I didn't need the password: the PC booted up when it didn't before. Just to be sure, I checked that I could move the cursor with the mouse and type in the password field with the keyboard. Indeed, that worked, and every USB port worked.\n\nNow, some might have booted from another hard drive or something to see if it worked okay, but given the nature of the original problem, that didn't seem necessary. Plus, the client didn't live so far as to make a return trip that impractical, and if he took it back to me I wouldn't have charged him again.\n\nWith that, I contacted the client and let him know his computer was fixed. I delivered the computer to him and got paid for my time, the CPU and the power brick. \n\nIn retrospect, had I looked up what a North Bridge was or the memory controller, I would have discovered that those functions in modern computers are part of the CPU itself, rather than separate chips on the motherboard. So I might have saved myself some time that way. But some lessons you end up learning the hard way. Thankfully, it wasn't the kind of thing that damaged previously good hardware or caused data loss.\n\nTL;DR: I thought the motherboard was bad when it was throwing a spurious \"RAM error\" code, due to my outdated ideas of how motherboards and CPUs work. It was the CPU.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677176002.0},{"title":"\u201cExcuse me, can you send me an internet guide?\u201d","author":"AskTheRealQuestion81","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/11974io\/excuse_me_can_you_send_me_an_internet_guide\/","text":"Back during the late 90\u2019s, my folks gave my grandparents (Mom\u2019s parents) our old computer.

Been a while since my last post, so hopefully I don't bump into any new rules along the way.\n\nBackstory: At the time of this story, I'd recently started work at a small IT support company which had various remote clients (about 15 to 20 minutes drive from our main office). Most of what we did involved remote support, but there was often on-site work as well.\n\nOne particular client I'm going to call Woodies Woodworking or **$WW** for short. Our contract with Woodies involves basic maintenance of their onsite hardware, which usually is just the bi-monthly emptying of saw dust in the cases. Today however, they'd just re-opened after a holiday period and noticed their file server was down.\n\nJessica from **$WW** (**$WW_J**) calls to request support for this one while I'm out on site with another client. She informs me the server is down, and I give her instructions on how to identify if it's powered on. I verify that it's not online on Anydesk or Teamviewer, and in this time **$WW_J** has decided to start rebooting anything tech related in what she thought was the server room.\n\nNow to be clear, I'd never worked with **$WW_J** let alone worked on their site before this day. So I was piloting a non-tech savvy client, blind folded, into finding a server I didn't know where it was and identify the issue with it. We quickly gave up and assigned this as a service call, and I went out on site once I'd wrapped up with my current client.\n\nBy the time I rock up, **$WW_J** was on break and I was left with her co-worker, Karl (**$WW_K**). **$WW_K** was slightly more tech savvy but not quite enough. When asked to take me to his server room, **$WW_K** took me to his main fiber ingress point to the complex - a messy cabinet in the break room of cables and haphazardly arranged networking components - a wifi router here, a 24 port gigabit ethernet switch there...\n\nAt this point I recall during handover from the previous tech, that **$WW** was using a series of cheap NUCs purchased from a certain Chinese online retailer, and these served predominately their office staff, but also their file server. So, going into the office section of the complex, I found it - a NUC sitting in the back corner of the (absent) manager's overcrowded with junk office, alongside two WD reds sitting in an offline external USB caddy, and the cause of all our problems.\n\n**$WW** had cleaning staff come in a week before they opened back up. These staff had used any available power point to power their vacuum cleaners. One such powerpoint they chose to use, was an occupied one - The servers. And rather than restore the machine, they simply left it powered off. Nobody knew where this server was, or even that it was a server, and so it just stayed off until I switched it back on.\n\nFortunately no data was lost, the server was back up and running in about 10 minutes, and considering how busy I was we called it at that. I'd later go on to move their server into the same cabinet as their networking spaghetti, put a lock on it, and give the manager the only spare key.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677063677.0},{"title":"Service provider with no electric","author":"jasondbk","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/1196bfa\/service_provider_with_no_electric\/","text":"This happened a few years ago in a city near the big auto makers.

As this is in-development software, it\u2019s pretty common that users do stuff that make the devices restart or disconnect from the server. It\u2019s my job to then go fix the device and bring it out of error. Some customers throw their devices into error all the time and some rarely do. Most customers are pretty easy to work with but sometimes people can be a little\u2026 silly. \n\nWe have one customer that likes to act like ever device in error is the end of the world. It is common that we will email them saying we brought the device out of error and they will respond saying, why is this happening so often. Please fix root cause. But there isn\u2019t anything to fix, and device isn\u2019t actually going into error often. \n\nLast week, this customer responded to a resolved ticket saying the device was going into error all the time and we needed to fix it. I checked the case history for the device, including monitoring, and found that this was the first time this device had been in error in a month. We don\u2019t really worry about a device going into error often until it starts going into error daily. A device going into error weekly is nothing to bat an eye at. That\u2019s a pretty common rate for a device that is being used heavily for testing. So I just responded to the customer and told them that a device going into error once a month didn\u2019t count as often, and they can monitor on their side and let us know if they keep seeing problems with it. I left the ticket on auto close if they didn\u2019t respond within the next few days. They didn\u2019t and the ticket closed. \n\nToday, they responded to a resolved ticket saying the device goes into error every other day and we need to fix it so it stops doing that already. I looked up the device and discovered that it had been connected to hosting for the first time 2 days ago. \n\nIn other words, this was the very first time this device had ever gone into error.

and didn't check at least the once with the 24 pin cable disconnected for the problem? what was his reply? \"if the power button doesn't work it means the pc is broken, i and never open them\" from that day on all the broken pcs were tested by me.\n\nmy second story, around the 5 months mark i get a call from my Pc (personal commander) that i need to replace the CO (cheif officer) PC with a new one, no problem i say i go in replace the old PC, install all the apps he needed and go on with my day.\n half an hour later i get a call from my Pc again, he asked me to rush back to the office, because the PC i replaced is not working, so i run back in and before i enter i can hear the CO screaming his lungs out, about why the new guy did this work because i obviously know nothing.\nthe second i enter the OC starts going off on me, that me and my commander are failures of \"computer man\" and that we need to learn to do our job, i just ignore him and go over to the PC and start to troubleshoot.\nPC on but no display, ok lets restart it, still no display i look if the screen is connected correctly and it is, but then i noticed something... the screen... its off, i turn it on and everything is working perfectly, i facepalm myself, explain to the OC what was the problem and what i did, then he laughs tell us \"sorry for screaming and please leave my office because i have a meeting byeeee\" while pushing me and my commander out, we walk a few steps then start laughing our butt's off, and ever since that day we were good friends and we still laugh about it from time to time.\n\nand my final story, i get a call from my IT friend telling me that someone reported a broken pc and i need to look at it, ok easy i go there and i see a perfectly working pc and a girl, i ask her whats the problem with the pc? she tells me her keyboard is broken and she can't log in.\n i ask for her password and press \"show password\" and what do i see? all caps and why is that? because she accidentally pressed the capslock and was sure that the keyboard is broken, while trying not to laugh i explain what capslock is.  then try to enter the password again, it logs in everything is working she says thanks and i go on with my day.\ndid u think i was done? no the same girl reports her pc completely broken a few months later, so i go in and have a look, again the pc works perfectly but she accidentally made her icons from small to large and didn't like the way it looked, i again explain to her whats the problem and how to fix it, after that ask her not to report a broken pc for stupid things like this again, she says \"if she reports it broken then i will come to fix it faster\" i sigh she thanks me again and i leave.\n\nthanks for reading! this is the best storys i have until now, but just so you know i deal with things like this on a daily basis, and i swear sometimes i think that the computer personal in my base collective IQ is room temperature.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677003695.0},{"title":"I've been through ten cans of electronics duster just this month?!","author":"fuknthrowaway1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/117koke\/ive_been_through_ten_cans_of_electronics_duster\/","text":"Seeing a burning receipt printer here yesterday I thought I'd share mine.\n\nAlmost thirty years ago I got suckered into supporting the point of sale system at a video rental place. The owner was my old high-school Geology teacher, but the real hook was that my stoner brother was the new assistant manager there so I'd be getting calls for help regardless of whether I was being paid for them or not.\n\nAround six months after agreeing to support them I get a call at my day job from the owner, saying that the receipt printer 'smells funny'.\n\nI ask him to elaborate.\n\n>Owner: You know how when you wear a coat around a campfire, and then, even though it's been washed you'll still occasionally catch whiffs of smoke?\n\n>Me: You need to unplug the printer and send that coat to a dry cleaner. I'll be over tonight.\n\nThat evening, with an anxious owner leaning over my shoulder, I popped the printer open. The cause of the smell was easy enough.\n\n>Me: The problem is all this fluff. The paper rubs on the metal guides here, and it builds up here, on the parts that get hot, so you have to clean it out once in a while.\n\nI pulled the roll of paper out, picked up a can of electronics duster still conveniently located right next to the register from when I'd had the exact same conversation with the manager just over three months previous, and give the printer a nice quick spritz.\n\n>Me, popping the paper back in: There you go. Fixed.\n\n>Owner: How often does that need to be done? \n\n>Me: Once a week? I suggested the manager add it to his opening duties on Monday last time I was here, guess he forgot.\n\nTwo months later I was out to have a look at a flickering monitor (loose VGA cable) and gave the whole thing a once over. Ugh, the keyboard has crumbs in it, so I pick up the can of duster, still conveniently located right next to the register, and.. \n\nNothing.\n\nOh, wait.

We've only got two cans left to last the week!\n\n>Me: A can should last you months! What the hell have you been doing with them?\n\nSo he shows me. He opens the printer, removes the paper, and sprays away at nothing in particular for almost a minute.\n\n>Clerk: And we gotta do that every time we change the paper or it catches fire. Jerry got burned and went to the hospital when he forgot once.\n\n>Me: I should've gotten a call if this had caught fire, and who the hell is Jerry?\n\n>Clerk: Some guy that use to work here, like years ago, I dunno.\n\nI tell the clerk that he doesn't need to dust the printer ever again and call the owner to ask him about Jerry, a printer fire, and a possible hospital visit. He's never employed a Jerry, the printer has never caught fire, and the last worker's comp case he had was an idiot that thought he should climb the shelves and do a King Kong impression.\n\n>Owner: Still, I've been through ten cans of electronics duster just this month?! That shit's like three bucks a can!\n\n>Me: Yeah. According to the label on the box it was only delivered three weeks ago.\n\n>Owner: Are you sure they're not huffing it or something? I mean, I hire a lot of my students, and it's not like I teach AP classes. Look for teeth marks on the nozzles.\n\nNo teeth marks. What actually happened was somehow stupider than teenagers huffing. See, he'd told the manager to clean it on Monday, and that's where a game of stoner telephone started. The manager forgot to do it the very first time he was supposed to and told my brother to do it at close. So my brother did, every night, until one night when he felt lazy and asked a clerk to do it for him. \n\nAnd then the five part-time clerks played telephone amongst themselves, eventually leading to them cleaning it every time they put in a new roll of paper, and with increasing amounts of duster every time.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676927525.0},{"title":"Listen mate, there's smoke coming out of it, I don't think a driver update will fix this","author":"mattthepianoman","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/11673xg\/listen_mate_theres_smoke_coming_out_of_it_i_dont\/","text":"Years ago I was working as an in store tech for a big electronics retailer in the UK.

But I've been with the company the longest out of my current department and the support team, so its only natural.\n\nIn December, a customer reported their organization's firewall was blocking access to our web software.

She said ok, the ticket was closed, and she gave us a 5 star rating. Its all documented in the email chain. Job done, for now.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, 2 months later. One of the account managers escalates her email to me. Basically, she hadn't used our equipment since December and was refusing to pay the fees for them because she \"couldn't use them\". I asked her if she ever got up with IT and she said no, and then said that WE we're supposed to contact their IT. What the hell...\n\nI told her I could see in the email chain that we explicitly instructed her to contact her IT and that she agreed to do so. All she said back was \"well, you're support for this equipment and I need support with this equipment, so provide the support\".\n\nNothing I said could get this woman to understand. She's demanding to be refunded 3 months of invoices because she made the deliberate decision to ignore what we told her.

He likes to stick his nose in random matters of the company\n\nIts definitely him, as the MX company has personal records and bank statements to confirm its him.\n\nWell I can't change it back as I don't have those pieces of info and if the lowest person in the IT totem pole does, then our data security is garbage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI alert the rest of the IT team as this is a all hands on deck situation , emails that go to the highest tier of our company aren't coming through .\n\nOur team looks into it and it turns out what the MX record rep said wasn't quite accurate.\n\nAs our CEO never made theses changes.\n\nSomeone , somehow got a hold of personal details and bank details to fake being him and make the change.\n\nTook several days to confirm what happened and fully fix things .\n\nBut because I was paying attention , I prevented the malicious individual access to our companies incoming emails for likely 30 + hours before everyone else would have noticed on Monday.\n\nAnd to no ones shock, as the IT person who found this.\n\nNever thanked by anyone from head office....of course.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676620586.0},{"title":"Todays Murphy repairs\u2026","author":"MacTechG4","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/1147ztl\/todays_murphy_repairs\/","text":"Customer 1 brings in a basic, low end PC laptop, basically a tablet motherboard in a box with a keyboard and trackpad, very low end, saying \u201cmy battery life sucks, my trackpad doesn\u2019t work and now it\u2019s not even powering on\u2026\u201d\n\nTake the unit out back, verify the issue, then meter out the adapter brick, if it gets any voltage at all, it\u2019s maybe 2 volts\u2026 machine needs 19 to run\u2026\n\nThen I notice the cut (almost a bite, really) in the middle of the power cord, kinda like that of a cat\u2026 a rather jealous cat that wants all the attention the customer is paying to her laptop\n\nYep, that\u2019ll do it, call the customer and leave a message, then grab my universal adapter only to find it\u2019s burnt out, and the replacement hasn\u2019t arrived yet\u2026\n\nThanks a lot, Murphy!\n\nOh well, I expect this unit to boot fine with the universal adapter once it arrives, aside from being a cheap, throwaway box, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything wrong with it visually.\n\nCustomer 2; brings in a smartphone with a screen protector installed and a basic 3 layer case, the screen protector (a tad undersized) is undamaged, but\u2026\n\nThe screen is cracked, because it landed at just the right (wrong?) angle to have something  strike the screen precisely in an area NOT covered by the screen protector\u2026\n\nOne new screen later, I recommend they purchase a screen protector that fully covers the screen and a non-knockoff multi layer case to protect the repaired phone\n\nCustomer 3; another smartphone, but this one has a battery that has swelled so much it dislodged the third party replacement screen, because the adhesive gasket was not installed, in this particular case, it allowed the screen to pop up and minimize pressure on the swelled battery without breaking the screen or causing the \u201cMagic Smoke\u201d to escape from the battery\u2026","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1676600044.0},{"title":"Want someone else to do my job?

Also the software, while being mainly used for one purpose, usually in one way or the other gets used throughout the whole company using it, so with bigger companies, they sometimes have multiple departments, each only supporting parts of the software in-house, basically each department of the company having their own in-house tech-support for our software.\n\nSo with this one customer. They have one main-support-team (containing, but not led by the CTO of the company) for our software and each department has their own sub-team who answer to the head of the main-team. As always, new years had brought new laws and regulations. Especially in one department, an up to now optional feature became mandatory by law starting 01.01.23. Mind you, the information about the new law was public in February 22 and our software supports this feature since the middle of 21. So enough time to configure, test and move to production with it, right? Unfortunately, as it's an extremely technical topic, i'm currently the only person in our company's support-team with in-depth knowledge. We're working on changing that, but not everyone who works in support has a background deeply rooted in software development, so it takes time.\n\nWell, starting January this one sub-department, basically a one man show, as it's a rather small department at the customer started sending support tickets \"this isn't working with the new feature\", \"that isn't working with the new feature\" and so on, 7 Tickets total, all highest priority, because \"it's an error message and we're legally required to use it\". Each and every one of the tickets I answered them the exact passage of the manual where they could read up that exact error message, explaining how it's a missing configuration on their end and exactly (with screenshots!) what to configure. These configurations are not part of any kind of support plan we offer, so work on these tickets is a \"pay by hour\" thing for the company. Never got any reply to them so considered them done with that.\n\nWell, i guessed wrong. I got another highest priority support-ticket today stating it's not working. Obviously i asked, if the configurations i sent over in the other tickets have been done, to which i get the reply, how should they know, they're just back from a multi-week vacation. I politely replied, that he should check those configurations and to not cost them unnecessary money, i would hold off working on that ticket until he checked them.\n\nThe reply i received to that basically stated, that he found it very audacious that there are now 8 open highest priority requests about that topic and the company i worked at haven't moved a finger in the month since they were submitted and that he demands i hand over those tickets to someone else in our support-team, who actually wants to do our job or he will escalate the issue to the main team.\n\nNow, you should know that this customer is one of our biggest clients, so their requests inherently get slightly higher priority on our side and also we know that they generally (with a few black sheep obviously) have a very good in-house team, so the team is pretty liberal at routing their technical requests through to me. Because of that i get to work a lot with their main-team who handles those technical issues and the bigger the installation, the more troublesome. They enjoy working with me so much, that for the past half year or so we've been on a first name basis when communicating (including the CTO). An information, that obviously hadn't reached this poor soul yet.\n\nSo, to spare him the work of escalating the issue, according to process i wrote a formal escalation mail (using first names, petty, i know) to the lead of their main team, as well as my team-lead cc-ing the guy from the sub-team, informing them about all the highest priority tickets, including detailed information since when the feature is available, when the information about it becoming mandatory by law was publizised and when it became mandatory, compiling the answers from all the tickets into one and also sending an official, detailed by ticket, offer with which they could purchase service from us to do those configurations for them. I also included a letter from our legal team that every customer had received about half a year ago, that we are not liable for any damages they incur by not testing the feature before the legal date.\n\nAbout an hour later i got a formal answer from one of their main-team that the configurations i sent have been implemented and every issue has been resolved, the feature works as intended, thanking me for bringing to their attention that they were behind on that topic, followed half a minute later by an informal mail informing me that i don't need to worry, the next person to submit tickets on behalf of that one-person department should be much more professional.\n\nAnd the moral of the story: Don't try to threaten with authority you don't have.\n\ntl;dr: Customer-Employee threatened to report me not doing his job while he went on vacation, got fired for it.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676490382.0},{"title":"Why you should not threaten people with Something, you know nothing about","author":"P3chv0gel","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/1139m9x\/why_you_should_not_threaten_people_with_something\/","text":"So i was working for a company that produced parts for oil processing and we had customers\/Partners all over the world.

I had been selected (go me!) to support our division's biggest and most complex client. Our division was split into two halves. My division, which I'll call Boons was by far the bigger and more complex side. Within it I supported 15 or so products. The smaller side, which I'll call Doggle, had about 4-5 products. Both divisions appeared to an outside observer to be remarkably similar. End users got them mixed up all the time. So did our clients. It was like filing a lawsuit in federal or state court. It may look the same, and it often is the same, but there are lots of things that will trip you up if you're not familiar with them.\n\nI was very experienced in Boons. In some cases I was our local expert. By sheer necessity I also understand a fair amount of the Doggle's environment, legalities, terms, processes, etc. But I had zero understanding of their applications. I had never used them or even seen them. I had approached my manager about cross training, but it was something we never got around to. I had plenty to keep me busy, and besides I never interacted with the Doggle's clients anyway, at least not in terms of their products. Clients knew to approach the appropriate representatives most of the time, and would typically understand if they were gently redirected.\n\nThen I got the big new client. By chance their enrollment with us happened at roughly the same time that Conglomerate rolled out this new idea that we would all work together. We would work as one seamless entity. Every division, and every group within the same division too. I will go to my grave not understanding this edict. It was employed relentlessly in our marketing materials and in our internal cheerleading. For years. Aside from that, nothing else was ever done. At least not at a level where I could see it. It was like a coach showing up before each game to make a passionate speech about \"trying harder,\" and then leaving immediately to cruise the streets with the top down.\n\nSo we all kept on as before, sometimes working well together congenially, sometimes not. I once had a division tell our mutual client that an issue wasn't their problem, and they should \"call Conglomerate.\" Uh no, *you are Conglomerate*. I don't care that Conglomerate bought your company just a scant three years ago. You are now Conglomerate, just like me. Let's not piss in each other's faces please, at least not in front of the client.\n\nBut big new client took this to heart. This \"you can contact any of us about any issue at any time\" made a big impression on them. It's one of the reasons why they picked Conglomerate as a provider. So they started contacting me about anything. And I mean, anything. I once chased an opaque line item on one of their invoices for weeks. Since their time zone was about 3-5 hours behind mine (depending upon the office), I would often come to my desk to find a bunch of new tickets waiting for me, filled with head scratchers and wild goose chases. \n\nNormally this contacting me about stuff I knew nothing about was a minor nuisance. I grew comfortable flipping them over to the right person. They also learned pretty quickly that it was all a myth (which infuriated them, but they had already signed the contracts and migrated all the infrastructure, so what could they do?), so the pile waiting for me shrunk over time. Except for one particular issue.\n\nSince they thought of our division as one big product suite, why shouldn't I help them with Doggle's products? It's the same thing isn't it? This caused a lot of problems since Doggle questions could be time sensitive, where they needed to make decisions that day, so they wanted a response same day.\n\n1. Since they were hours behind me, They didn't get to their desks often until it was around noon my time.\n2. The Doggle staff was on the East Coast, hours ahead of me. And they normally left the office a little before 5 PM their time.\n\nThis left me about a 1-3 hour window to call Doggle and get them on the phone so they could provide the expertise the client needed. If they called after 5 PM Eastern, I would have to go through the on-call sheet for Doggle.\n\nGoing through this exercise was maddening. Their representatives would routinely not answer the on-call phone, tell me that I should help the client, refer me to other coworkers, say they don't have their laptop, say they've only been on the desk for a few months and don't feel like they can help, etc etc etc. Any and every excuse you can possibly think of I heard. It often took 3-4 hours for me to find someone who was willing to help them.\n\nThis was particularly frustrating when our operations center would call my on-call phone, *just so I could contact Doggle's on-call staff to help the client*. That at times would mean I was playing phone tag for hours, from my house, in between trying to look after my kids. There was one person who would actually respond if she was on call, who I will call Taneesha. She too had kids and often took these calls while trying to juggle family life and helping big client. Often she ended up being the person who was finally tapped to help even when she was not listed as the on-call resource.\n\nThis situation went on for almost a year while I routinely whined to my manager, occasionally commiserated with Taneesha, and also tried to speak with Doggle's support manager. It only took that long for me to realize why the client kept calling me. It was simple. *I was answering my phone.* Except for Taneesha, no one else was. It was that simple. That was the reason. That epiphany prompted me to send the angriest email I ever sent to any boss. Particularly one I otherwise liked and respected.\n\nIt began with 72 point font in red capital letters saying \"CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS PLEASE? DO I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION? *I SAID DO I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION?*\u201d And then a long stream of consciousness rant about how Doggle sucks! The manager of their staff should be fired! Taneesha is the only one there worth anything! They should double her pay and fire everyone else! There are no repercussions for Doggle staff blowing off me! Blowing off our client! Why the hell is Operations calling me and not Doggle regarding Doggle products! Which can only truly be supported by Doggle staff! Can you riddle me that? Can you?\n\nThe email to my manager got a one sentence response. He would look into it. Shortly thereafter the responsiveness from Doggle support improved. However, karma also struck in that Taneesha quit. She told me the main reason was because it seemed like she was doing all the work for their team. Which she was. Which pushed her to find a better job.\n\nSo, Believe it or not, Big Client once again went back to reaching out to me, and telling operations to reach out to me, because the Doggle on call staff were worthless. Couldn't they talk to Taneesha? No, you can't. So Conglomerate hired someone new, in my time zone, specifically to help support clients further west. Someone who sat next to me at work, knew his stuff, and had a decent work ethic. Yahoo!! After that, they stopped calling me. \n\nSo my manager eventually came through. I had come to respect him and I'm certain he was spitting fire just like I was, behind the scenes though. On the other hand, shortly after all this happened, the manager of Doggle support was promoted. There is no justice.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676424439.0},{"title":"The last chapter from Acme Corp - We need you to sign this","author":"techtornado","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/112n6xp\/the_last_chapter_from_acme_corp_we_need_you_to\/","text":"Cast:    \n$Roadrunner - Me - expert at working very quickly and efficiently    \n$Wil-E-Coyote - Head of Arizona field ops   \n$VP - Nitpicking     \n$IT - Savvy team of 4 \n\nOne fine day of working hard to keep the IT department moving along at Acme Corp. Inc. LLC GmBH^(TM)  \nthe team was called up one by one by the Acme VP of Nitpicking to the ivory tower (3rd floor) who announced the unceremonious dismissal and dissolving of $IT as an expense-cutting measure.\n\nThis decision would ultimately cost them much much more in the end, but more on that later.\n\nMr. Nitpicking presented a non-compete agreement in full leagalease and noted a crappy stipend would be given to assist in the platform migration to an Arizona-based Bigger morer expensiver servicer provider ($BMSP) run by the renowned Wil-E-Coyote himself. \n\nNote that $BMSP cost more per month than it would have to give everyone a 30% raise *and* buy the new hardware that Acme needed, so it's already a slimy deal no matter how the anvil is sliced. \n\nHe said that if one felt so inclined, we could talk to a lawyer about it and told each team member to not discuss anything about the non-compete and that we needed to make a decision within a week's time.\n\nThe official reasoning for the non-compete was that we had access to the entire company workflow and we could use that information to help competitors gain an edge for a company that holds nearly the entire market share in the US and Europe.\n\nI contested that claim because the creaking infrastructure is 7 years old, but common tech and nothing we did day to day was exotic or unique except the one time I had to use a hammer on a printer. \n\n\\*VP stares at me in French\\*   \nHe then shoos me out of the office to summon the remaining minions.  \nOnce we read through the fine print, guess what we did?\n\n(Met and discussed it)  \n\nOur supervisor had a way of talking in words that the C-levels understood, so he took the lead on the revisions, but let\u2019s just say that paper could have been wrung out with enough ink to refill   \nthe Acme surprise Fountain Pen (patent pending)  \n\nThe VP was a bit bothered we rejected the non-compete due to how broad it was, and whether or not the office ceiling was stained a nice shade of green has yet to be determined. \n\nHow broad you say?\n\nIf it was signed, one would agree to the terms where you could not work for any company that sold, distributed, manufactured, warehoused, or transported products within 100 miles of the tri-state area.\n\nBeing that nobody was competing with Acme, this was a very steep agreement and we saw this was aimed at the salesweasels to not steal customers, but IT somehow was granted the privilege of enduring such nonsense.\n\nAfter much consternation and groaning by the VP, he got the brain trust involved and revised the   \nlegal-beagle wording to have a whole lot less llama-drama and trimmed it to say just the specific industry that Acme works in - which is to provide reliable and excellent quality props for movie and film studios.\n\nThen the whole cabinet went on holiday for most of Thanksgiving, December, and New Years. \n\nConveniently enough, nobody followed up about the non-compete and I saw no reason to remind them about it, so it did not get inked when I signed out for the last time.\n\nI went job-shopping and after the first interview, I started in the New year to make a smooth transition that ended on good terms with the team at Acme.  \n\n\\*A few months later\\*    \nAfter getting settled in at Whirlwind Computing    \n(The MSP that can blow the competition away)  \n\nOne day, I hear the $WMSP interns ~~complaining~~ observing the scope of a big project at Acme Corp involving data recovery, a giant rubber band, full server rebuilds, iron glue, and forklifting a large database.\n\n$Me - Really now?  \nI ask what\u2019s up and found that $BMSP hired them to be boots on the ground because of a massive fudge-up they caused with the file server... and it\u2019s backup.\n\nI share some insights on what I did there and how it was all supposed to work before they scrapped the department\/old servers.\n\nThe team thanked me for the insight and said it was a total cluster of what $BMSP did as it took about a week to fix everything and get the servers and their platform running again due to the incorrect usage of Acme standard issue magnets.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676428088.0},{"title":"\u201cIt won\u2019t import, it keeps giving me an error\u201d","author":"ginger-inside-007","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/112belz\/it_wont_import_it_keeps_giving_me_an_error\/","text":"Old story of mine.

At this point, my patience ran out, I was tired of being cussed at, and wanted to get away from that place.

I deleted the last letter in the file name. \u201cImport it,\u201d I said as I walked away from him. He looks at me like I\u2019m insane.

She's not being paranoid.  It did in fact happen.  Her colleague called her, she answered. They talked for five minutes. Later, she got an email with a .mp3 file and written transcript of the call. Being Very Freaked Out by this is reasonable.  She is Very Freaked Out.\n\nI looked through what data we have, and I can see one system says there was a 1:1 voice call that lasted for five minutes.  Another system says the call was transferred to voicemail.  If it *was* transferred to voicemail, the first system should have a little cassette-tape icon instead of a phone-with-arrow-pointing-away icon.\n\nThe correlationIDs from both systems match.   It definitely was one phonecall and the systems disagree about whether it was a voicemail or not.  \n\nTo me, that's just one weird thing:  Somehow the call forked and the system that mostly thinks about voicemail thinks it was a voicemail. The system that tracks voice calls thinks it was a voice call.  Maybe some freak split-second timing is required to explain why both systems think they took the call. One should lock the other out, but maybe there's a 0.01 ms window where this could happen. Tiny enough that we've never had this happen before.\n\nBut the telephony support people have a theory:  They must already have been on an external PSTN-PSTN call completely external to our system, and then during that call one of them also inadvertently called the other from their VOIP client to her VOIP client. That is, A used his phone's calling app to call B's cellphone number. But *also* A used the VOIP app to call her VOIP app.  She answered the first call but not the second, the second rolled over to voicemail and recorded the entire  conversation.  It could happen.\n\nThere would be two calls but we'd only see one of them.  The telephony guys insist that there must have been two calls, one voice call that was answered, and a separate call that was not.  They categorically reject the idea that one call could get forked like this and two different systems each think they owned the call.\n\nSo the two-call theory is also just one weird thing - but only if both systems agreed that the second call was a voicemail.\n\nRather than see this as a single call that got split somehow into two streams, each tracked by its own part of the system, the telephony engineers think that there's a bug in the second system that caused it not to recognize a voicemail *as* a voicemail.\n\nSo now, two weird things are required.  The ONE TIME, EVER that someone has inadvertently called someone they were already talking to using a completely different client app at each end of each call, the call was ALSO affected by a bug we've never seen before that misclassified a voicemail as a successful two-party call.\n\nI'm skeptical.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676334207.0},{"title":"I think a user might be too embarrassed to talk to me","author":"polandreh","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/1117y1f\/i_think_a_user_might_be_too_embarrassed_to_talk\/","text":"At my work, we have two technology teams: Desktop Support, and Systems Support.

My friend works in Desktop, and he deals with all the new joiners, setting up the accounts, handing down the hardware, etc., as well as regular support, so *everybody* knows him.\n\nAbout 6 months before this... \"incident\", a new joiner started, let's call her $user. My friend set her up, but as with every joiner, he had to help her navigate the company portals, registering user accounts, setting passwords, RSA tokens, mailboxes, etc. Having visibility of the Desktop Support inbox, I saw $user's name pop up many times, so I knew about her before ever meeting her. Also, $user isn't in Operations, so she hasn't met me.\n\nOne Friday, most of the office is WFH, including my friend from DS. However, $user would need some help getting her Bloomberg account setup, so Thursday evening, my friend tells me \"$user will be coming to the office tomorrow to set up her Bloomberg account. Can you help her log in the Bloomberg terminal?\" Cool! Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.\n\nFriday morning, $user arrives and asks \"are you $polandreh?

I'm gonna be vague for obvious reasons, but I'll change jobs soon so I don't mind that much if someone finds out it's me.\n\nCharacters in this story:\n* yours truly\n* A customer representative, called the customer for readability\n* Our head of support\n* Another dev\n\nThis happened earlier today.\n\nSo, this week I have hotline duty. That means, when our daytime support is done for the day, support calls get redirected to my phone until they take over the next morning, and for the whole weekend.\n\nThis nice Saturday afternoon, I get a call from a gentleman (the customer) with a bad connection and a thick, but not completely incomprehensible accent - still a bad combination. I barely understand what he's trying to tell me, but he seems miffed about the fact that \"we already sent two E-Mails\" (policy in our support contracts is you call to notify support, THEN you E-Mail details if necessary). There is some problem with data not showing up in our system, so I say I'll take a look at the mails and get back to them.\n\nI boot up my work laptop and take a look. The E-Mails are basically just a data dump from their business end of a data transfer process.\n\nSome more context: Our software is highly customised for different customers. I have not dealt with this particular customer before, so I'm not familiar with the inner workings of their particular flavour of our package, but support staff recently added common support cases to each customer's wiki page. I get lucky and one of the described problems seems to be similar to the one currently happening. I connect to their system via VPN and take a look.\n\nThey seem to dump data in a transfer database table which is then collected by our system and put into our database according to our model. Some datasets are marked as successfully transferred, but do not show up in our system.\n\nI restart the transfer service and mark the records as not transferred in the transfer table. The customer checks and yes, now the records are there.\n\nI'm not the best with these types of things, so figuring this all out and fixing it took about two hours. Overtime pay semi-well-earned.\n\nI figure there might have been some network hiccup, but I get a feeling that it's not and this will not be the last I'll be hearing of this.\n\nLess than 3 hours later, I get another call. Same issue again. Okay, probably not a hiccup. Customer also tells me that they have lots of data coming through the next day (yes, a Sunday, but the customer is in a country where that's basically the equivalent to our Monday) so we can't just manually adjust until main staff gets back to work the day after that. Damn.\n\nI call our head of support and ask him whether he has any idea how to solve this. He doesn't, but he knows who has the most knowledge of that customer's code. I call him and to my relief, he picks up even though it's a Saturday.\n\nWe take a look together and it's just weird. Some records are there with fitting IDs, but different data, and we just get more confused as we look through the stuff. How does this stuff get transferred, but not transferred? We come to the conclusion that there are some crossovers between IDs, but since our system is strongly typed, we determine that the records that have been reported by the customer to not be visible despite being marked as transferred, have in fact not been transferred - no data in the database, no trace in the logs, nothing. But what went wrong? Did the customer put in corrupted data? Did our service mark the data wrong?\n\nOther Dev suggests we get on a Teams call with Customer, and I'm completely out of my depth by now so I have no objections. They talk for a few minutes, and then it hits my colleague.\n\nYou see, we have productipn servers and test servers. But because customers usually don't replicate their environments for our test systems, tests are often done with connections to live external data. You might see where this is going.\n\nThe same data collection service picking up data in the live system also ran on the test server. With the same configuration. And whenever a new record was put in for transfer, whichever of the two hit their refresh first would pick it up.\n\nAt that point, my colleague apologised profusely to me and told me to get out of the call, he'd handle it, for he was the one who had handled the tests and configurations.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676156017.0},{"title":"How do I...undelete?","author":"WizardOfIF","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10zvhyq\/how_do_iundelete\/","text":"Yesterday was my last day at a job I've held for nearly six years.

We help with phone solutions and IT solutions for all kinds of businesses. I mainly focus on VoIP support\/helping customers with their phones, but occasionally I like to help with I.T. support as well. I love my job and I pride myself on my customer service skills. \n\nWe recently acquired a small phone customer in our town that we already did IT support for. I had been to this client's place before our phone contract to work on their network and fix a computer. It was maybe a dozen phones that they needed. I got them set up and got their phones ready in no time.  The point of contact (we'll just call her POC) at the business was bit lost when it came to anything IT or Phone related and she was also very rude to IT guys, especially me.\n\nThe install process is easy. All we do is hook the phones into their network and possibly attach a power supply if they don't have PoE. My phones are already provisioned before I go onsite and have all the settings ready. Again, it was small install of about a dozen phones, so it was going to take no time and no hassle since I already knew the layout of their building.\n\nI didn't have to make any changes to the phones at all or the network while I was there. It was essentially plug-in-play. I was midway through the install and on the other side of the building when POC calls an employee close to me and asks, \"Where is urFriendlyTechGuy?\". The employee explains to her on the phone that I'm installing phones on their side of the building. POC is on speaker. I could tell she was frustrated.\n\nPOC: \"He needs to get over right now and fix this.\"\n\nI respond to her and say I\u2019ll be right over and that I\u2019m happy to help. I walk over to her side of the building and immediately as I walk in the door she says, \"What in the hell did you do to our network?\" Confused, I tried to assure her that I hadn't made any changes and that I was just plugging in phones.\n\nPOC: \"Well I can't access my *special software.* I don't have internet!\"\n\n (I won't say the name of the software she was using so I'll refer to them as \"Special Software\" because I don't want to seem like I'm dogging on the software. The software company was just experiencing an outage on this day.)\n\nI told her I would look at it and see what's going on. She made a smart remark about how it stopped working when I got there. I ignored her comment while I looked at her computer. She still had internet service, but her special software was not working. I could access other sites with no problem. I even called another I.T. tech from my company and he tried the special software site from the office, and it wouldn't load. We called in to the company that manages her special software and their main message said they were currently experiencing outages.\n\nI told her about their outage and she flipped her lid on me. \"This is your fault! It was working all day with no issues until you arrived.\u201d She said to me in a very mean tone.\n\nI politely and calmly responded, \"You're right. Because me plugging in phones on the other side of your building would affect your special software\u2019s servers to go down, right? I won\u2019t be spoke to this way.\" \n\nShe got quiet after I said this because she realized how stupid she sounded. I immediately left her office to get into my car to call my supervisor to explain the situation to him. He knew she had been a \"problem child\" before based on what other techs had told him. He advised me to go wait in my car and he would be calling me back. About 15 minutes later, he called me back and he told me to come back to the office. He politely declined to provide them anymore service unless she apologized to all our techs who she had yelled at or been difficult with. Apparently, she had said some pretty rude and harsh things to another tech one time when ISP went down. She sent us an email a few days later apologizing and asked for us to come back to finish the phone installation. \n\nShe left their business shortly after that and we continued to service them.

(Zombie servers, besides wasting resources can be taken over by bad actors, but that leads to a tale for cyber security) Anyway, what would happen was that people would set up a server.  Then just forget to decommission it. We did an audit and took note of servers that were not being used and we communicated the best we could with the known server owners. After a couple of months, we removed the servers from the network. Then we let them sit for a couple of months. Occasionally a customer would say, hey, where did my server go?  And we tell them to keep better track of their equipment and put it back in service. But most of them were abandoned and we would decommission them. The number was in the thousands. Probably 10% to 20% of all the servers we had.  One server got through this process, and we were in the process of decommissioning it. We had removed the disk array and were starting to wipe the disks. I think it was RAID 5. Lo and behold, the customer calls up all in a panic. Seems they needed that server once a year. And we're all like, Gee, don't you ever read your emails? Oh, also they did not have a backup. Real smart for a critical server that you use once a year not to have a backup. We found a company that could recover the raid array. We removed The disk array from the server. From our scrap pile, we kludged together a couple of old computers. With a raid controller. And connected them to the Internet through a secure tunnel. This enabled the vendor to recover the data. It took them a day or so, but they were able to do it. The recovered data was copied to a USB hard drive. While the recovery was in progress, we rebuilt the server with a new array. We didn\u2019t want to touch the original disks just to keep our options open. We went to copy the data back to the server, but all the server had was a USB 1.0 port. It was going to take forever. Fortunately, there was a Microcenter a few miles away and one of the guys races over there before they close, because you always find you need stuff with minutes to spare.  He got a higher-speed USB card, installed it, copied the data back over to the rebuilt server, and got the customer back in service.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675866557.0},{"title":"Photocopier won't print in colour","author":"sandsy4","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10wtkao\/photocopier_wont_print_in_colour\/","text":"This is just a funny little one that happened today.\n\nI work as the only IT support in a small primary school.

Plugged it into the USB port on the computer, unplugged the existing one from the printer, plugged this in, more virginal fumbling. No print. WTF\n\nStarted getting in the weeds. Removed drivers.

I was working for a small company to earn a few extra bucks during high school.  Although I was initially hired to do data entry, they quickly learned that I was able to fix a lot of their computer and networking issues.  After doing things like upgrading their 10 megabit hubs to 100mbit switches and rebuilt the network with a topology that actually made sense, I moved on to setting up actual servers -- starting with a simple print server.  I eventually convinced them to shell out a bunch of money for a fast file server with gigabit ethernet and hardware RAID!  When the server arrived, I started setting it up and the owner of the company wanted to see what he had just purchased.  Specifically, he wanted to know why we spend so much extra on a hardware RAID controller, so I did a quick impromptu demo.  Since the server was new and I was still setting it up, I showed him how any of the hard drives could fail, and the server would keep going.  I stupidly did this by pulling one of the drives and showed him how it showed as failed -- then plugged it back in and showed how the controller automatically detected this and started rebuilding the RAID.  So far, no actual harm and the owner was very impressed.\n\nI then went to lunch to let the server continue installing things, and came back to a blue screen.  It turns out that the owner was so impressed, that he decided to repeat the demo a few more times for some of my coworkers.  We all had a good laugh as I explained to him that while yes, RAID can recover from an occasional hard drive failure, there are limits to this process, and maybe we shouldn't be randomly pulling drives from the server just for fun.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675717957.0},{"title":"\"Are you SURE you're putting in the right password??\"","author":"queendogma","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10vun7y\/are_you_sure_youre_putting_in_the_right_password\/","text":"*This tale is sort of a hybrid of tech suppot, plus customer sided. I think it's a good fit for this sub and that maybe the readers here would enjoy it, but please remove this if you feel like it breaks rules.*\n\ntl;dr at the bottom\n\nI used to work from home for a company that hired and trains call center agents, and I'm sure you're all intimately familiar with how bad individuals in a boring office setting can be with tech (of course it got worse when people were working from home). I know it, you know it, everyone knows it.\n\nI'm very aware of the nonsense tech support has to slog through, and I absolutely hate wasting people's time so whenever I had issues I made sure to pre-emptively do whatever I needed to make the tech's life easier. Turned the computer on and off again, made sure everything was plugged in, make sure the monitor didn't accidentally get shut off, whatever I could. Because of this, I cleared up most of my issues on my own. It helped my team's manager a lot because the rule of thumb was, if I was down, EVERYONE was down.\n\nOn this specific day, the login was giving me issues that I was putting in the wrong password. Checked for capslock, made sure my strokes were going through (so no missed or doulbe inputted keypresses), still no luck. At this point I figure maybe I accidentally locked myself out trying to solve the situation on my own. Sure, that's fine -- it happens. I go to the website for self trouble shooting, and request a manual password reset. It asks you to put in some identifying information yourself and input a new password. Pretty standard, have done this many times before.\n\nTry to log in, still no luck. Same as before, rinse and repeat. Now this has never happened to me before. I've locked myself out a small handful of times but I've always gotten it taken care of, but resetting into a lock out has never happened.\n\nSo instead of logging into my work PC through the VPN, I did a login without the VPN which gutted whatever access I had to my computer, but it at least let me put in a support request ticket. The ticket system we have to go through that we had to fill out for issues that includes very standard stuff. Which domain you logged in, what type of VPN you had, hardware info - etc.\n\nIt always starts off with a text chat. A few minutes after submitting my ticket a tech reaches out to me and asks me if I put in the right info, I say yes. He resets it for me manually on his end and asks me to try it again. Do the same thing. Same results.\n\n\"Are you sure you're putting in the right info???\"\n\n\"Yes I'm sure.\"\n\nAnother couple of resets, and at this point I'm worried there's something wrong with my keyboard despite doing everything in my power to confirm my inputs were right.\n\nI could tell the tech was growing increasingly more frustrated with me, and I'm pretty sure he was rolling his eyes at this huge case of 'users always lie.' At this point I felt like I was both stupid and\/or crazy. I was promptly escalated to tier 3 support.\n\nTier 3 is always a live call when you work from home, and he went through the standard fare 'did you turn it off and on again' and reviewed the entire log of the ticket thus far.\n\nThe tech manually reset my password just like before but told me to type my password into the user box so we could visibly see if my input was correct, and copy paste it. We did this, and now we knew without a shadow of a doubt that I'm not misentering my password, and that there's also no issue with my keyboard not parsing properly. Which to me, is a relief.\n\nThe tech I was now working with was a guy in his late 40s early 50s, and he's seen some shit, and it was the first time he's ever seen anything like it. The fix took a long time of active back and forth between me and the tech -- easily over an hour. There was a lot of backdoor manual VPN shenanigans, and multiple reinstalls, or reimages. It was a long time ago, and I've forgotten what happened for the most part.\n\nFrom my understanding, it looks like there was some glitch in the matrix where my user key went ghost in the system so no amount of password resets would help me because my username didn't exist in the database anymore. The password resets were all successes, and my login info was correct. I wasn't able to log in. All of this was mutually exclusive.\n\nAnyways it ended with the tech saying \"I've never seen anything like this,\" in a pretty positive tone. Maybe the absurdity of it all was refreshing, or maybe the bug was interesting to try to work through. He finished by manually re-registering my user credentials in the database, and the reinstalling of my work VPN before letting me go and resolving my ticket.\n\nEvery once in a while I think about how I probably frustrated that tech. I hope he's having a good day right now.\n\ntl;dr the one time the user didn't lie.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1675750559.0},{"title":"Another Tale of Missing Backups","author":"ascii4ever","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10vez5m\/another_tale_of_missing_backups\/","text":"Back in the day I was tech support and system administration at a University.

I spent some time having her try to remember what files she might have had that were important.   I was kind of hoping she could just re-install Windows and pretend she had a \"new\" laptop.  She had lost some project files for a class she was taking, I recommended talking to her professor right away.  Explain what happened, throw yourself on their mercy, maybe you'll get some extra time or something.\n\nShe was very upset (who wouldn't be?), and went off to talk to her professor.

We should note here that this was the first and only Small Business Server installation that I ever did (this becomes important later). So I do the installation of all three systems, built thier AD and group policies out, and spent the afternoon showing the admin how she should get the backup tapes in and out of the server and which tapes go when, so they had a backup rotation.\n\nFast forward about a year. She calls me up and starts with \"Hey, I think I messed up. I just accidentally deleted our Quickbooks file off the server.\" No problem, I'm thinking - it's 8:30am. We'll just pop in yesterday's tape, since there's no recycle bin for deleted network files. So I ask her to grab yesterday's backup tape, to which she responds \"Tape...

I check the server and confirm that no backup has been run since I was there to do the installation the year prior. I cast about for a solution, and in that moment, the gods smiled upon me.

The kind of work that if it came through as a ticket in a regular job would be immediately \"request denied\". It never came to much and I didn't have the motivation to work for myself, but after very suddenly losing my job it was much better to say self employed rather than unemployed for my CV.\n\nSo I had a few appointments teaching retirees how to use an email client and save address books for their folk band and family, attach photos, that sort of thing. Painfully slow and repetitive, but still satisfying to see these people with long successful careers behind them never needing to use a computer take an interest and delve in. People who would never get in to it without some entry level guidance.\n\nThe familiy IT person, I've just realised, that people go to when they can't print off a recipe. But paid. It was a change of pace from usual IT work. Glacial. But it was fruitful for all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then there was Client. Client was an owner of a number of local businesses, successful ones too. Bars and pubs I'd been to a few times myself. So we discuss rates and arrange some visits, I wonder what kind of questions I'm going to get from him and hope I'm going to be able to cover them. Could it be some financial or business management app I have no clue about? Do I need to research anything? I ask him if he has anything in particular to look at and he says no, I'll just show you when you get here. Ok. Client becomes the one to teach me that some have MONEY money. So much money they are beyond the cares and anxieties of mortals. They are above the clouds, it is a different world with different rules.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I arrive at his office. I'm led up by a member of staff, asked if I want a coffee or anything, and told Client will be with me shortly. They make some kind of friendly, gentle joke about Client needing heavy handholding so he'll be glad to see me. Client is 15mins late, while I am being paid by the hour.\n\nClient arrives, makes small talk, lounges about and takes his leisurely time settling down. A good 10mins goes by with him chattering away, while I am being paid by the hour.\n\nClient is interested in a new sports car. He wants me to show him how to find a video that compares them. So I google \"<Car 1>  + <Car 2> + <Car 3> Comparison\" and find a youtube video similar to Top Gear style reviews. So we watch this 25min video. Of cars. Being compared. While I am being paid by the hour.\n\nClient: \"Fantastic, so what did you do to bring that up?!\"\n\nMe: \"I googled <Car 1>  + <Car 2> + <Car 3> Comparison\"\n\nI don't know how else to say it, I'm half expecting him to get annoyed and accuse me of being patronising. \n\nClient: \"Great, thank you\"\n\nI can almost see him forgetting everything I've just said before my eyes. The staff member's light joke comes back to me. Were they trying to warn me? We make conversation about cars I try to keep up with. I don't drive and have zero interest in them but for a good while I'm like yay cars. While I am being paid by the hour.\n\nMe: \"So is there anything else you'd like to look at today?\"\n\nClient: \"Yes, can we look at my emails?\"\n\nMe: \"Of course\" Some actual IT work? \"What's wrong with them?\"\n\nClient: \"I've got so many of them!\"\n\nAnd so he has. 8000+ unread emails. So we start to go through them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne... By... One.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile I am being paid by the hour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe this is a common IT person trait. Depending on the material, we do not read. We skim. There's only so many articles written by Microsoft MVPs rushing to be in the first 100 to publish a thousand word post, describing \"Where tf have they moved it to this time?\" for people trying to figure out how to achieve the most basic task in the latest version of Windows, before we learn to skip the first three paragraphs. We train our eyes to ignore the \"Hi my name is NoOneCares, I've been in in the business for NoOneCares years, here is a list of my NoOneCares qualifications. In this article we will...\" and go straight for the first mention of anything relevant. My eyes will drop to the lower third of the screen and start scrolling for actions. As so:\n\nblah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle **Open...** blah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle **Right click..** blah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle blah blah waffle waffle **Navigate to...**\n\nThis is how I function. This is how I need to operate. This is how I stay sane. \n\nEvery deity help me. Client is going to read each and every email. One by one, word by word. While I am being paid by the hour.\n\nAnd he does. Not being an IT person he reads every single word, slowly. He's sat right next to me and asking for my help sorting them, so the implicit agreement is I'm privy to the content and am reading them too. And whether I want to or not I speed read through each in the blink of an eye getting the gist and wait for him to catch up.\n\nWe can't even skip some that look like spam. My instinct is to delete and ignore the many \"new business opportunity!\" emails but the first one we come to he says he's been waiting for it. And it is legit, it's a genuine follow up to an enquiry. And so we continue, mail by mail. While I am being paid by the hour.\n\nAnd this is how I come to learn Client uses his business email address for personal use also.

I don't really need to solicit new business and the ones that come and go tend to balance each other out. Gone are the days when I would actively seek out new accounts. But, I still get referrals or people find me online and if it sounds like work I can slide into the portfolio I'll sometimes take it.\n\n**The Call**\n\nSo when my phone rang one morning with an unknown number, I let it go to voicemail. Same number called again about ten minutes later, this time leaving a message.\n\n\"Hey IT Guy. Found your website and it looks like you are local. I'm (describes small business close by) and need some help with a situation that must be dealt with today. Give me a call back so I can get a quote.\"\n\nMy day was light so I take the bait.

My usual internal IT worker is unavailable and I need someone to get this up and running ASAP.\"\n\n\"OK...you would be a new client and since I don't know your systems or setup, I would need to do some intake work to diagnose what is going on that.

They can still perform some basic applications but have huge security holes due to lack of patching and upgrades. All seem to have some kind of virus or physical defect.

Problem is that it is not even on. Attempts to power it up fail. It is just dead.\n\nI spend most of my first day making sense of the network, getting that room at least organized. Figure out how to get on the firewall, an old machine that has \"Great Firewall of Ron\" emblazoned on the side. (No joke, that was written on the side of the tower in what appeared to be white out.) The firewall was so old I had never seen anything like it. Instead of wasting time trying to figure it out, I just deploy a spare Sonicwall I had lying around. That, at least ,got the internet back up.\n\nI briefed the owner at the end of the day. Internet back up at least for now. Backend was going to need some equipment upgrade and workstations were so old they might not even be worth trying to salvage. The server appeared to be completely dead and would need about another days worth of work to further diagnose. I told him to make a list of business critical functions that must be up because that should be the priority.\n\nHe did not care for my professional opinion and told me there was nothing wrong with the workstations and the server backup just needed to be restored. He clearly had no understanding about how bad this situation was or what could be done.\n\nAfter giving him a reasonable plan of action he comes back at me to tell me all my plans are unnecessary. OK. I ask him what he would like me to do and his answer is \"FIX IT.\" I can see we are going no where fast here and I am losing my patience. But, I throw out one more proposal that I get his workstations in good working order, finish the rack job in the network room, and spend the rest of my time on the server to finish out the engagement. He will have none of it though ranting that I have no idea what I am doing. \"This is why I don't spend money on IT!\"\n\nThe guy has already prepaid me and under the terms if he rejects my proposed work plans, then I can walk with the money. I don't like to do this unless it is necessary, but here it was becoming obvious that was going to be the best way out. We have another tense back and forth and I de-escalate by saying I'm going to go home for the day but he should call me tomorrow if he would like to schedule the additional work.\n\nIt is three days later and no call.

In this situation, the server wasn't a server, too, but the other way around. I'm sure I am incorrect on some of the technical details since it was a long time ago and secondhand, but the gist is correct.\n\nMy friend got called by an office who had fired their previous consultant. They had worked with the previous guy to build them a server for file storage and an app backend. When my friend arrived, they told him this story:\n\nThey had spec'ed hardware to meet the app vendor's recommendations, and it was actually pretty solid. It was real server hardware, not just a beige box. It was delivered with one CPU, but capable of four. It had lots of slots for memory and a SCSI RAID setup. They were never really satisfied with the performance, though, and the other consultant looked into it and decided that it was CPU-bound, so they added another CPU. That didn't really seem to help. In waves, they ended up getting four CPUs into the box, adding a bunch more RAM, etc., and the thing still sucked.\n\nSo they called my friend in, and he looked at it. It was all pretty well set up, honestly - but the installed OS was a desktop version (Windows 95, maybe? I don't remember, but that was about the right timeframe), which of course was not capable of using more than one CPU. So they had high-spec server hardware sitting there, with three processors just sitting idle.\n\nHe got them a license of NT4 and installed it, and things got much better from there.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675523310.0},{"title":"That\u2019s your problem right there","author":"Baldussimo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10sux3s\/thats_your_problem_right_there\/","text":"First time poster, mobile device, please be gentle, you\u2019re all very good looking etc.\n\nVery short and simple, but I still think of this occasionally and it makes me smile.\n\nSome 10 years or so ago, I was working in tech support for an external IT provider.

Get everyone worldwide to fix this!","author":"dave999dave","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10szmaf\/fix_this_get_everyone_worldwide_to_fix_this\/","text":"I posted something a few days ago that described a challenge I had around [the definition of a business day](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10q4qpp\/as_the_world_turns_what_is_a_day\/). I faced a similar challenge years earlier around when a transaction occurred.\n\nIn my old industry there were multiple entities involved in each transaction. Customers would make a request via a terminal, which would connect to an acquiring entity, which would connect to a network, which would connect to an issuing entity, who would respond. The response would flow back down to the terminal. The customer would then complete their transaction and go on about their business. All of this combined should take 5-10 seconds.\n\nOkay. What time did this happen? Typically the important time is the one from the customer's point of view. If they looked at their watch, what did it display? Unless a user made a manual note of the transaction, they would need to rely upon what was printed on the ticket or what they saw later in their account. What was printed on the ticket was almost always set to the local time for the terminal. If that was a physical terminal, then the user would have been standing in front of it. And their watch would have matched the ticket.\n\nHowever, it was important to keep in mind that the \"ticket\" the user received was created and printed by a mechanism distinct from the process I mentioned above. Think of this in terms of a cash register. The register prints a receipt. But totalling up of the items from a grocery basket is completely different from the authorization process related to a debit card. So the date\/time recorded on the cash register receipt has nothing to do with the date\/time recorded for the authorization. This was a very similar situation.\n\nI hope this makes sense, because this is exactly what I had to explain to our biggest and most complex client. They wanted to know why the date\/time on the statement for their clients often did not reflect the date\/time of the transaction. Why not? In fact, in over half the cases, the date\/time on the statement reflected GMT. Why were most of the transactions set to \"England time?\"\n\nEach step of the process I mention above was captured by the relevant environment as it passed through. It was date\/time stamped and logged according to the settings in that environment. My company always used Eastern US time as the stamp. We also captured the stamp of the terminal as well.\n\nThis is where we ran into trouble. The terminal's date\/time was supposed to be set to the local time of its physical location during installation. At least that was supposed to happen. Given that the relevant terminals were literally worldwide, my company used that time as \"the time\" a transaction happened. That's what appeared on statements, reports, etc. \n\nWhat actually happened was that setting was typically not touched. Given that the default time when shipped was GMT, that was normally the time used by the terminal. So when customers checked their statement, most of the time transactions were displayed in \"England time.\" The home base for my client was on the other side of the world to England, literally almost. So not only was the time wrong, but also often the date.\n\nEven if the date was set properly, the terminal could be moved too. I saw a few terminals which had clearly been installed at some point in the United States and a few others that had clearly been installed in Western Asia. They were moved to near my client's home base, but the time zone was not changed.  \n\nThis confused and infuriated my client.\n\n* The first suggested course of action was that we \"fix this.\" Sure. Just let me contact a few million people worldwide and have them modify the setting for each terminal, of which we had no ownership and no means to compel this. This was gracefully dismissed as impossible. (But they still brought it up briefly and bitterly at each meeting, how we should be able to simply fix this.)\n* We contemplated using our timestamp, then converting everything from Eastern time to the local time for their home base. However, although 70% of this particular client's transactions occurred in the same time zone near their home base, a fairly large percentage of their clients traveled to nearby countries. A significant percentage were true world travelers. If we converted everything from EST to home base time, that would still be wrong for some thousands of transactions per day. This was dismissed as simply exchanging one problem for another. The only difference here is that \"our\" timestamp would now be wrong. The wrong time would now be our fault. Or more accurately *more* our fault.\n\nThe one thing I never understood was, what did their previous vendor do? How did they handle this? This was not an unknown issue. It was common in the industry. Somehow their old vendor had hidden this problem from them. It was the only thing that made sense. But how? I could not figure that out. Did the old vendor have some means of matching a terminal to a time zone? They must have, or else my client would have had the same issue. However, they couldn't have, since that was impossible. I'm still baffled by this.\n\nEventually the client stopped complaining. I think they eventually realized there was nothing we could do. So they gave up.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675469147.0},{"title":"Old man and his iPhone","author":"Ich_mag_Kartoffeln","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10s5icy\/old_man_and_his_iphone\/","text":"The other day (probably the other week by the time I type, edit, and post this) I visited my grandparents, and took them out for lunch.

A few slides in after the history of the company and its importance in the industry and I have to interrupt.\u00a0  \n  \nMe:\u201dI\u2019m sure\u00a0 you all worked really hard on this, but I\u2019m here for technical details. Might there be a slide about those?\u201d\u00a0 \nThe quartet huddles for a minute, then looks back at me.  \n  \nRaymond:\u201dYou should have written your questions beforehand so we knew what to prepare for\u201d  \n  \nMe:\u201dI gave you all an agenda with the topics we\u2019d discuss. We\u2019re just going to have a friendly conversation about what you all do here. If we hit questions you don\u2019t know the answers to, we can find other people to ask. Is that cool?\u201d\u00a0  \n  \nClara (looking over the top of her excitingly chunky eyewear):\u201dAny questions you could possibly have are answered in the documentation we provided\u201d  \n  \nMe:\u201dAbout that.

I need to keep my composure if I want to keep this gig. I breathe in and out, trying to calm myself.  \n  \nMe:\u201dAll right. Let\u2019s try this thought experiment. Imagine a large, iron-nickel asteroid comes in and smashes much of Allegheny County, vaporizing us and this datacenter. How would BigCorp\u2019s business be impacted?  \n  \nThere\u2019s a silence, other than the susurrus of the HVAC system and Raymond\u2019s open-mouthed breathing. I\u2019m about to regret my open-ended question until I hear Stefanie\u2019s voice.  \n  \nStefanie:\u201dI\u2019m writing a report for credit. This datacenter hosts Email, calendaring and chat capabilities for BigCorp along with another datacenter in San Jose, California. It also hosts development servers for GreyGoo, our new product offering. If this data center went down, BigCorp email would automatically switch over to the other datacenter.\"  \n  \nMy soul re-enters my body with a snap.  \n  \nMe:\u201dIs she correct?\u201d  \n  \nClara:\u201dWell, that\u2019s a gross oversimplification.

A few minutes of fiddling and I have my laptop connected to the projector. I put up the list of servers and we go line by line like an Active Directory eye exam. At the end of this, I\u2019m hoarse, sweaty and in possession of a very rough data flow diagram for GreyGoo\u2019s development environment. It\u2019s a smaller mirror of the production environment and a bunch of repository servers. I take a few pictures of the scribbles and send them to Stefanie, who promises to make them into coherent documentation for the next assessment.  \n  \nI have what I need for now for a half-assed report. There may be follow up questions but I\u2019m tired of being here. I thank everyone for their time. Clara jets out of the room, while Raymond tries a soliloquy about how useful and productive this session was and that our hard efforts made real improvements to BigCorp\u2019s metrics. I flash him a wan smile and gather my stuff. Clyde walks me out.  \n  \nClyde turns to me and gives me a thin smile.  \n  \nClyde:\u201dI\u2019ve never seen someone just stick with a question like that with those two\u201d  \n  \nI laugh and bid him a good day. As I walk to my bike, I pull out my phone. Huh. I have about five missed calls and a few texts from a number I don\u2019t recognize. Oh boy. Mark the Interface Guy from HQ. I wonder what he wants.  \n  \nI call him and hold the phone between my shoulder and ear while I pack the saddlebags of my motorcycle.  \n  \nMark:\u201dHello, BigCorp Help Desk\u201d  \n  \nMe:\u201dHey, you were trying to get a hold of me for some reason?\u201d  \n  \nMark:\u201cYes.

I was asked to create a report that would indicate if a task was late or not. Based upon priority, tasks had to be completed within a certain number of \"days.''\n\nAt first this was straightforward. Business days were the only thing that mattered.\n\n* I excluded company holidays. They didn't count.\n* I excluded weekends. They didn't count either.\n\nHowever, the concept of \"business days\" didn't consider that tasks could arrive at any time, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The actors were on-call too at times, so handling work related to the tasks also could occur 24\/7.\n\nNow let's do some basic math. Let's say a task is assigned at 8 AM and is finished at 3 PM the same day. How many days have passed? My patron told me 1 day. What if it was assigned at 8 AM and finished at 3 PM the next day. My patron says 2 days. How about assigned at 11 PM and finished at 3 AM the next day, so only 4 calendar hours have passed? Or even where an actor is assigned a task on a Saturday morning and completes it on Sunday evening. Would that be zero days, since neither of those are business days? My patron considers this and concludes we have to push the start time to 12:01 AM of the first business day after the task was assigned. Okey-dokey.\n\nNow we have a simple formula. Clock starts at 12:01 AM on the first business day after the day the task was assigned. Clock ends at 11:59 PM the day the task was completed. If the day of completion is not a business day, the task ended on the last business day before the day of completion. If a task is completed in the same calculated within 24 hours of the start date\/time, that is 1 day. Beyond that just count the business days. This was fairly straightforward to set up and validate. (Mostly. I do remember there was a discussion around what happens if the task is completed before the official clock begins. Is the day count zero? Should the eager beavers be rewarded? Or wouldn't that confuse leadership?)\n\nHowever, we merged with another company that had an international presence. So now the relevant group had a lot of users in other countries. This introduced a lot of variation that I never truly solved:\n\n* Each country had their own national holidays.\n* When a day began and ended depended upon the rotation of the Earth.\n\nSo now a \"day\" depends upon upon the user's country. In theory this was somewhat easy to account for. Each user had a home location, which included the country. Just use that and add the relevant days to a holiday table which maps to the actors home country. However, the actors performing the tasks could be in one country, and the consumers who received the outputs could be in another. Which perception of a \"day\" mattered here? My patron again simply stepped in. He concluded the that the actors perception mattered. (He was darn helpful with these decisions). Okey-dokey.\n\nAt times there was collaboration between users. In some cases the task would begin in one country, but end in another. Which \"day\" mattered here? My patron, after some thought, decided that we would have to switch to the consumers perception of a \"day.\" Great. But which consumers? In many cases they were located in multiple countries too. After some more thought, my patron elected to return to the actors perception, but retain the concept of a \"day\" aligned with the very first actor assigned to the task.\n\nThis final arrangement prompted some consternation:\n\n* There were protests from some actors. In some cases a task was reassigned cross countries so that the concept of a '\"day\" meant the task would be late, through no fault of the person who it was re-assigned to. That didn't seem fair.\n* Some countries had a generous holiday, work hours, and leave policy. This meant that in terms of sheer calendar days, people in some countries could take longer on their tasks and still have them be on-time. That didn't seem fair either.\n* Finally, the consumers in some countries grew frustrated at how actors in other countries were more often \"late\" with their tasks. But they weren't late, at least not according to the metrics. How does that make sense?\n\nAs time passed, see what I did there, I gradually moved away from working on this stuff. One of the last things I did was an analysis of cross-country collaboration and consumption. I concluded that more than 80% of the time the relevant tasks were primarily acted upon and consumed in the same country. So, most of the time this was a non-issue. When I last talked with my patron he consoled himself with that analysis. He decided that the gripes would never end no matter what he did, so we might as well stick with this arrangement. He kept the definitions as is.\n\nI left as some new on-call policies were rolled out that called the definitions once again into question. (I learned that some of continental Europe's worker protections were a lot stronger than in the US. Apparently you cannot simply modify someone's role to--surprise!--be on call like you can in the US.) Conversations were just starting on how to revise them and I never did learn what the result was.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1675185611.0},{"title":"counterproductive pseudoscience","author":"Obadiah-Mafriq","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10p6rln\/counterproductive_pseudoscience\/","text":"Head of HR contacts us saying her laptop keeps shutting down for no reason, frequently, right in the middle of her doing things.

Someone suggested it could stand alone here. I've rewritten it with more details. Enjoy!  TL;DR at the end.  \n \n\nA long time client called with a keyboard issue. It would just randomly stop working and could only be fixed with a reboot. However, it would stall again at some point but it was always random. This guy, we'll call him Red, owned a branch office of a financial consulting company.  He had a few people there. Red is no dummy, knows enough about computers to install software and hardware, swap out components, etc so he opted out of the corporate recommended IT support because they were very expensive and very slow. When he was truly stumped with an issue or just didn't want to take the time to solve an issue then he would call me.\n\nSo, anyway, on with the keyboard issue.  He'd reinstalled drivers, swapped out the keyboard, and a few other items until he was ready to fix it with a chainsaw.  This gave me a pretty good baseline on where the issue was not located.  My first step was going to be swapping the keyboard to another USB outlet. Could be he goobered it up somehow and it's just making intermittent contact.\n\nI pulled the case out from under the desk and discovered ALL of the ports were occupied.  Even on the front of the case. So I started tracing the wires:  printer, mouse, scanner, keyboard, wifi, headset, external HD, and a big red button with corporate's logo on it. Press the button, browser should launch,  and takes you to their home page. I had never seen one of these so I decided to try it. Nothing happened.  I figured it was outdated or had the driver removed or something like that. But at the back of my pea brain a little voice was telling me to unplug the button and test the keyboard.  So I unplugged it and everything starts working fine. Pluged it back  in and the keyboard goes wonky.\n\nSo Red and I get on the speakerphone to corporate's in house support because they required EVERYONE to purchase one of these for every computer in the  office. Likely tens of thousands nationwide. Red says \"The big red button is not working. What---\" and the IT guy immediately cuts him off. \"DISCONNECT ALL OF THE BUTTONS AND THROW THEM AWAY!\"  Apparently there was an epidemic of this going on company-wide.  The guy on the phone said there would be an email from corporate next week telling everyone else to do the same. Seems about 30% of these things were  defective. There would be no refund, either. Red was not happy about that, especially considering his lost time from the keyboard craziness and the lost funds from me and the buttons.\n\nRed later heard through the grapevine that some VP had a kid with an ad specialties biz and convinced marketing to buy these things without consulting IT. The vendor could program the action of the button to do whatever the customer wanted. The total cost per unit was about $0.50. The company \"sold\" them for $20 each. He only bought them for his desktop units. Didn't get any for the laptops that also doubled as desktops when the reps were in the office.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Keyboard goes crazy at random times. Turns out it's a USB device with a big button that launches the web browser to corporate when pushed. Corporate required all locations to purchase these devices and many fail. No refunds, either.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1674959928.0},{"title":"A mouse?!","author":"Arrukshallam","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10nzc50\/a_mouse\/","text":"I was once responsible for a specific software in our production area.\n\nBecause in this area the people where not this firm with computers and stuff, I was doing a lot of trainings and had hand made a guidebook for every function they would ever need.

(Part 1)","author":"evelynsilver7967","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10ncxyl\/doctors_office_running_windows_98_and_xp\/","text":"Approximately 2-3 years ago, I was working as an on-site technician for a tech support company when I was assigned a job at a medical clinic. The owner of the business had expressed concern over the slow performance and reliability issues of the clinic's computers, but was hesitant to replace them.\n\nUpon arriving at the clinic, I was greeted by one of the doctors who informed me that the clinic's owner would be returning shortly. The doctor showed me behind the front counter, where I saw about 4 computers, all running Windows XP. But then, my attention was caught by another computer, a yellow (previously beige) one, running Windows 98. I knew then that this job was not going to be an easy one.\n\nI had a conversation with the doctor regarding the clinic's computer system \"So, these are the 'new' computers,\" the doctor said, pointing to the Windows XP machines. \"And these over here,\" he continued, gesturing to the Windows 98 computers, \"are the 'old' computers. They're for our medical database software. The 'new' computers are for everything else, like email, internet, word processing, etc.\"\n\nThe doctor then invited me into his office to show me the setup, which was similar to the setup in all of the other doctors' offices. The computers in the office consisted of an old Windows 98 computer and a \"new\" Windows XP computer. The doctor explained that when the clinic upgraded to the \"new\" computers - around 2008, the medical software did not work, so they had to keep the old computers as well.\n\nAt this point, the clinic's owner returned and introduced himself. He mentioned that all of the staff had been complaining about the computers and that previous technicians had told him they could not fix the system. The owner then showed me the \"server\" room, which was a small, dusty room filled with a disorganized mess of cables and outdated equipment. One some shelves there was a switch with a mess of cables coming from holes in the walls and ceiling - no patch panel, just terminated and plugged in to the switch, and an ancient D-Link wireless router. And then I saw the 'server' - an old Compaq server from the mid-1990s, connected to a CRT monitor, keyboard, and mouse - all on the floor. The server ran Windows NT 4.0.\n\nI explained to the owner that the ancient system should be removed and replaced with a more modern software solution, but the owner felt that the software was too expensive and that the current system worked fine for them. He just wanted it \"fixed\".\n\nAs a temporary solution, I suggested building two separate networks to separate the \"old\" computers, and not connecting it to the internet. I got a proper gigabit switch - the old one was actually a hub! for the \"new\" computers, and kept the \"old\" 98 systems connected to the hub. The ISP supplied modem was also a router, which then connected to the D-Link router so that was a double NAT. I threw the dlink router in the trash and connected the switch to the ISP modem\/router.\n\nThe server, which was an old Compaq server from the mid-1990s, needed to be accessed by both the old and new computers, luckily it had a second unused NIC, so I connected one to the legacy computer network and set up the spare one for the new network. When I logged into the server i didn't need to ask the client for the password - it was written on a sticker attached to the side of the server, nothing surprised me at this point. When I logged on I found that there was no backup solution. I asked the client about this and assured me he had a backup. He found a pile of CDs and handed them to me, one of these will be the \"backup\".\n\nIt turns out that the \"backups\" were just the windows installation images and some Symantec ghost images for the operating systems and software. I found one disc labeled \"Database backup - 2015\".\n\nThis server acted as a domain controller, file server, as well as the database for the medical software. I explained the backup was so outdated it was worthless, he admitted the last person who knew how to do them left years ago, I asked if that was in 2015, and he said that sounded about right. I figured out how to backup the medical database and burned it onto a blank cd I found in the pile in the event the hard drive fails.\n\nI re-imaged all of the virus ridden XP computers with the ghost backups i found - done by whomever set up the system in 2008! All i needed to do was re-join them to the NT domain and they worked.\n\nAlthough the system was working better than before - mainly due to the hub being replaced with a proper switch as well as the viruses gone,  I explained to the owner that the Windows XP machines needed to be replaced with modern computers - or at least upgraded to windows 10 and a new server was necessary as the old one was incompatible with Windows 10 clients (as far as I can tell there is no way to make windows 10 join a windows nt4 domain). I also told him the network cables needed to be replaced and terminated properly with a patch panel, and wall outlets.\n\nMy plan was to get a new server and setup a new domain controller and virtualize the NT server for the database software, I could then upgrade the Core 2 Duo computers to Windows 10 until the client could afford new computers. The owner agreed but said that the funds for these replacements would not be available in his budget until the next year. I reiterated that this was a temporary fix, and the server needed to be replaced now, it was running ancient mechanical hard drives and there was no backups. If it fails then he would loose all of his customers medical records as well as the company's files. I told him he needed to find a way to make it happen as soon as possible. He said he would call next week to sort it out. I also explained that the Windows 98 computers needed to go as well. He said he would think about it, but didn't realistically see that happening anytime soon. He went on about how he had spent tens of thousands on this software, even though that was 25+ years ago.\n\nI got the client quote for a cheap server which would do what he needed it to do and I left the problem in his hands, but he never got back us - at least not for several years.\n\nLate last year we heard from the same medical clinic - It turns out he unsurprisingly didn't take my advice to upgrade the system and I was sent out to this client once again I will tell that story next time!","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1674905133.0},{"title":"Again, I'm not Tech Support!","author":"ukitern2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10niuqu\/again_im_not_tech_support\/","text":"Whilst usually UKITERN2 has major projects in various stages of implementation and planning, usually he gets drafted to help look at issues that Frontline Support, T2, and T3 can't solve.\n\nIn one issuance it's a blessing to spend hands on time with hardware, other times it's a curse of the position of being both good at the cloudly stuff and running a homelab and keeping those physical practical skills up to date.\n\nSitting at his desk UKITERN2 is on call, usually these last in shifts for 24\/7 operations but usually shifts last a day or so at most. SLA doesn't really matter so long as the problem gets fixed under best effort as most companies we deal with don't have that level of support. Those clients that do pay extra for a specialist team. Everything we do is billable to the client at a very high rate for those clients who don't pay for a support contract. Our side do not get called out to site, as it's usually a very billable event.\n\nBoss: We need you to look at a weird error going on with ($Client's) network, it's been right through support several times and we can't figure it out. The budget has been assigned to take a look but if we solve it, it will be a major feather in our cap with ($Client)\n\nUKITERN2: You got it boss!\n\n\\---\n\nA few hours later UKITERN2 ends up on the ($Client's) site and going through the problem with their company support staff.\n\nWhat seems like the Printer not being available for a few hours, transpires both us and them were out looking at it to be a backhaul network issue. Generally we don't deal with Printers but as it involves Payroll and Accounting we have to care.\n\nIn the programme managements offices - which are quite large with a split partition between employees and hotdesks. Ethernet plugged into network switch, network switch plugged into Core router. Pings ok, Traceroute ok, general basic diagnostics check out. Currently the printer is available to the network and responding to Ping.\n\nCore switch is in the server rack and network switch for the room is in the corner office of the of the floor of the office - which turns out is the access switch.\n\nChecking the ports of the Access Switch means being in the accountants office. Whilst doing this; a man pop's his head into the room UKITERN2 is in and says that he needs help with his computer NOW!! Whilst formulating a response the man becomes irate and says if he doesn't he's fired! (Must be serious UKITERN2 thought). UKITERN2 makes it clear he doesn't work for the company.\n\nMan: I DON'T CARE IF YOU ARE A TEMPORARY CONTRACTOR I WANT THIS FIXED NOW!\n\nUKITERN2: I think you misunderstand I work for ($Company) your accountancy soft... I'm not IT Support...\n\nMan: (Waves violently) NOW! (Face turns red)\n\nUKITERN2 gets greeted to the hotdesk on the clearly marked programme management set of desks which clearly doesn't have Ethernet but for some reason his docking station suspiciously does.\n\n\\---\n\nLooking at the issue appears to be that his laptop isn't getting Internet via Ethernet through his dock to his laptop. And the Wifi is abysmally bad.\n\nMan: SEE!\n\nUKITERN2: But wait- this is the project desk, how are you getting Ethernet? I've checked the switch over there and the plans and I don't see any Ethernet for these hotdesks?\n\nMan: We have (points) that we bought from ($Supplier) that we use off that ($Object)\n\nUKITERN2 traces the cable to find a garbled mess of wires from one of the Wired desks. An Ethernet HUB?!?!?\n\nUKITERN2 but its not configured correctly, that can't surely be a HUB?!\n\nUKITERN2 becomes curious and asks how it's powered. Well it's in the 4 gang switch that gets swiched on from the hotdesk... It's NOT A Hub BUT A CABLE ROUTER WITH DHCP!\n\n\"Holy Guacamole!\" UKITERN2 thinks to himself! And grabs local IT and the ($Company) IT Manager to look at this.\n\nBetween the wireless, ancient Cat5!!! cabling, the Router and some network devices that have clearly been there since the late 2000s. And just repurposed.\n\nUKITERN 2 hears the IT Manager say \"Hey is that the old Netgear switch?\"\n\nThe man interrupts that one of the programme managers had rolled off one of the jacks and had rolled his own mini network within the network to the programme managers desks.\n\nClearly no one thought to tell local IT at ($Company) this. As they start untangling the mess to assess the damage. Clearly the printer and some other devices were getting a different DHCP reservation because of the unauthorised hardware.\n\nAlso known as Shadow IT. Plugged into the network, doing stuff it shouldn't be.\n\n\\---\n\nUKITERN2: \"Well this is looks like your problem, shadow IT\"\n\nIT Manager: \"Guess since you solved it, you're looking for a payout for the printer? I think this should come from their budget, since it's their issue?\" (Office politic ensues for 10 minutes)\n\nUKITERN2: \"Sorry would you mind if I leave and head back to my office? Happy to mark up the ticket for payment and close the issue. Would you mind if I test the theory? Just to be sure?\"\n\nIT Manager \\*Nods\\*\n\nAfter testing that the printer indeed is getting the wrong DHCP reservation- or rather the kind-of right one but behind a NAT created by said device. All our pings and traceroutes were on that network segment in that room, hence no one noticed.\n\nIT Manager: (Looking a bit like an idiot that he didn't notice the problem) \"So the price will be ($Cost) from callout fees, time spent on site etc?\"\n\nUKITERN2: \"I'll ticket it up so you get the hours and I'll also raise up which budget it will come out of, hey look if it wasn't for this ($Man) I might never have known myself so don't put yourself down\"\n\nIT Manager looks like he took some solace in the understanding\n\nMan: \"What do you mean? You work for us?\"\n\nUKITERN2: \"Again, I'm not Tech Support\"\n\n\\---\n\nOn getting up the ticket, adding his hours and also adding comprehensive notes. He awaits payment- quite a hefty sum by some standards but a job well done. Not just the hours but the callout fee.\n\n\"Going to be quite the payday!\" UKITERN2 thought to himself.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1674922842.0},{"title":"It's not broken just because you expected a smaller number.","author":"PashPrime","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10mx7cg\/its_not_broken_just_because_you_expected_a\/","text":"I work as a Biomedical technician, maintaining all the medical equipment in a hospital.

One of my very first support experiences.  Apologies for length.\n\nI was a field engineer for a company that sold \"turnkey\" systems to various customers, some times local public agencies, which was the case with this problem.\n\nThe \"system\" was a 16 bit mini computer with various peripherals including large old style disk drives, line printers, \"dumb\" terminals (connected to serial ports), and a tape drive for backups.\n\nWe offered two options for tape drives, both used the old type half inch tape at 1600 bits per inch.  The more expensive tape drive was capable of moving the tape at 125 inches per second, and it was able to stop\/start the tape movement if the data flow wasn't fast enough to keep up with the tape writing.  These tape drives had a ton of servo logic to allow for this, hence the higher cost.\n\nThe second option was a \"streaming\" tape drive.  The drive would accelerate the tape to 75 inches per second and write as data flowed to the drive from the system.  The issue was that if the data flow was too slow, the drive would gently slow the tape to a stop, rewind it past the last written block, reposition the tape at the correct place, accelerate the tape and start writing again.  In the business this is known as \"shoe shining\".  Shoe shining is obviously not a good thing.  It is hard on the tape, and in slows the backup operation A LOT.\n\nAlmost all our customers chose the faster\/expensive option, but we had one customer that had picked the cheaper choice.  I'm guessing the sales folks just said, \"Its a only a difference of 50 inches per second, you'll never notice it\".  And at first, they didn't.  However over time, as the size of their data base files grew, and their system got busier (making it harder for the data to flow from disk to system to tape drive), the backup window grew.  And grew, and grew.\n\nThe daily procedure for these systems was that at close of business the staff would shutdown the programs that allowed access to the databases, then run the backup procedure (a staff member had to be around to change tapes manually), after the backups finished they kicked off batch jobs and left the system to run on its own.\n\nMy company started hearing from the customer that a) they were having to pay for more and more staff hours because the backup was taking so long, and b) the overnight jobs were not finished by the next morning so they were having to open up without the system being available, or they had to interrupt the overnight processing (after checking with the software support desk), which made them nervous.\n\nThe software support folks were able to advise on them on adjusting the overnight jobs, some of which were not very important and could be changed to run only on days when they had shorter business hours, which helped, but the operator hours for tape changing were unchanged, and actually increasing as their database grew.\n\nI got tasked with trying to figure out what the heck was going on.   We had a system with this same tape drive in our office, so I did some test backups on it and found it could generally get into \"stream mode\" and performed pretty well.  I actually timed how fast blocks of data were getting written to the tapes, then took these numbers out to the customers site.\n\nI created a script to backup the amount of data similar to what I done in the office and kicked it off.  In less than two minutes I could see the job was running much slower than my \"control\" job had.  The progress in data blocks was displayed on console I was using and I could see it counting up, pausing, counting up, pausing, every five to ten seconds.  \n\nThe tape drive was a \"side load\" type where the reels were inserted horizontally so I could not see what they were doing.  I put my ear next to the drive watched the console while my job ran, and I could hear the swish of the tape moving, then it would wind down, starting swishing again, wind down, pause, then swish up again.  I played around with tape drive and found I could peek inside and watch the reels, and sure enough, they were turning, reversing, pausing.  Rinse repeat, classic shoe shining.  \n\nI had no idea how to proceed so I called my support guys in the head office.  They were really cool folks but were surprised that we had sold this type of tape drive to this type of customer.  Usually the cheaper tape drive was only sold to smaller customers who's systems were \"less busy\".   Their only suggestion was to try running the backup procedure with the system shutdown to basically \"single user\" mode.  Kill all the background jobs, run the backups, then re-boot the system.  I was pretty sure the customer would not agree to this \"procedure\" becoming part of their SOP.   The support guys agreed and told me that swapping out the tape drive was their recommendation.  Great, that solution was going to please nobody, the customer wouldn't want to pay for an upgrade and the company wouldn't want to give them a free unit.  \n\nI went back to the drawing board and dug into any options that either our tape utility software offered or that the tape drive had.  After some research I found that the tape drive could be locked into running at the 25 inches per second instead of 75.  This seemed like a real long shot but I wondered if this would reduce the shoe shining since it would be easier for the system to get data to the tape drive at this slower write speed.  \n\nI re-ran my test script with the tape drive forced to 25 IPS and was happy to find that this did eliminate the shoe shining.  I peeked in again and could confirm that it was turning at a slower but steady rate.   It was still way slower than my \"control\" numbers, but it was faster than \"shoe shine\" mode.  With a somewhat heavy heart, I laid this out for my customer contact.\n\nMy contact was not thrilled.  She agreed to try this as a band aid, but made it clear this was not an acceptable solution.  My company had sold them a tape drive that was supposed to run at the faster speed, this seemed like a bait-and-switch, blah, blah, blah.  I said I would take this all up with the sales team and my boss.\n\nAs I had guessed, the sales folks did not want to swap out the tape drive.  They implied it was a hardware problem, it was the service department's job to fix it.  My boss basically told them, no, you sold them the wrong thing, you fix it.  I was off the hook since all this was above my pay grade, but we still had an unhappy customer.  We needed to figure something out\n\nLuckily, we had another customer with who was in the process of upgrading to an even fancier tape drive, one that could write at 6250 bits per inch, the latest and greatest.  Someone got the idea to take their old unit as a trade in, and offer that to the first customer.  The upgrade customer was pleased to have a modest amount credited as trade, my boss was happy to do the swap out for free, and the sales guys were happy to cover the incidental costs (different mounting hardware and tape controller hardware).  \n\nSo at the end of the day the problem was solved.  Not really a repair, more a correction to a system configuration\/sales error.  I saw a few of these at my time and the usual solution was throwing hardware at the problem.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674766630.0},{"title":"The Airport - Part 5","author":"PersimmonOdd3806","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10ltjup\/the_airport_part_5\/","text":" One final story from the airport series for those that are interested. It is going to be another long one.\n\nI will leave you with my third FIDS (Flight Information Display System) and paging upgrade adventure. FIDS and Paging are basically two separate aspects of the same beast. For those of you who don\u2019t know, FIDS are the screens that show your flight information at the airport. There are a few vendors that do this type of stuff. The first upgrade I was involved with was also quite the beast, but it pales in comparison to the third one. The second one I did was mostly just a computer upgrade from XP which was easy.\n\nSome background information on this. The FIDS aspect of the system is just a client\/server application. There are feeds the airport subscribes to for flight information from third party vendors and the server basically downloads the information and the clients update. Just another piece of software running on a box really.\n\nThen there is the paging aspect which is made up of an audio over ethernet protocol I will refer to as snakenet. There are several components to make this happen including applications and equipment like DSPs, DACs, mixers, speakers, etc. It can be very complicated. The airport was divided into different audio zones and there were 7 in total and areas within that like zone 1 area 1 or zone 1 area 2, etc. Each zone had dedicated equipment like DSPs, mixers, speakers, and other related stuff.\n\nAnyway, on to the third upgrade of the paging system I was a major part of, the project consisted of upgrading our main server and upgrading all of the audio equipment with new stuff. The old paging system was stable but aspects of it were starting to fail due to age. It was funny in that some of the audio equipment would make announcements sound what airline folks said sounded like a \"Cylon\" due to audio distortion. Or sometimes the audio channels would just stop working. I would have to disable those audio channels once I identified them, but it started happening more and more. Identifying the problematic audio channels was a real pain and it would take hours to cycle through all of them with test announcements and monitoring which channel was firing. \n\nThe project began well in that we started building the new environment alongside the old one. Everything is mounted, staged, and ready to go. Cutover night came and we crossed our fingers for a smooth transition. This all began around 8pm on that night. We have two engineers from our FIDS\/paging vendor onsite to resolve any issues and complete the install. All we have to do is replace paging stations and plug in the new equipment and we should all be good with all the prep work we have done. HAHAHA nope.\n\nWe switched out all of the equipment, so we were really at a point of no return. The first thing that happened was the new paging stations all crashed and went to an equivalent BSOD. The onsite vendor engineers went to work doing their best to resolve the issue with their development team. By the time the mid-morning rolled around, the vendor Dev team was able to somewhat stabilize our new paging stations. At least the airline staff weren\u2019t yelling out to passengers as much during boarding. I felt really bad for those vendors and myself since we were running on 30 hours of no sleep again. Not our first rodeo though with an airport related project.\n\nThe airlines started attempting to use the paging stations regularly after they stabilized from the BSOD and we quickly found a problem in that only one paging station worked at a time. As I said, the airport was divided into audio zones so if one paging station was using a zone, the other paging stations were supposed to go to a recording mode. Neither are working properly in that recording mode isn\u2019t coming on and the paging station is giving an error whenever there is a zone in use. It would be a few days before the development team figured that one out, but it did get fixed.\n\nThere were two other major issues. The first one was when making pages, only 4 audio zones could be activated and the airport had 7 zones total. The other problem was audio was dropping constantly. The problems weren\u2019t fully related. The 4 zone activation issue was a big problem causing random zones to be silent and miss announcements. It was pissing passengers off when they are in the restaurant drinking and they miss the final boarding announcement. These issues began the week-long war of the vendor blaming the airport network and us blaming the vendor and their shit equipment and setup that was sold to us.\n\nThe first thing we focus on is looking at the zone activation problem. I worked with an engineer and a dev guy. I asked them why the hell this was going on when it didn\u2019t happen before with the old system and they told me there was a built in restriction with the paging stations being able to activate so many zones on snakenet or the network is dropping it for some reason. Ironically the restriction prevented the paging mic from activating more than 4 zones at at time so there was the problem I felt. I don\u2019t even know why this was a thing. I mean this vendor did larger airports than us so surely this behavior had been seen before? Maybe I was just naive.\n\nThe vendors did packet captures on the snakenet network segment and nothing really looks amiss, but they are still blaming the network. There wasn\u2019t any progress on this until I asked them if there is a way to just broadcast to all zones and bypass the restriction on the paging station. Imagine that there was a way to override the restriction and just totally broadcast from the paging station so I have them turn it on and the problem goes away. The paging station is able to open up all of the zones without an issue. I am thinking I just absolved my network of any sins since the snakenet network segment was layer 2 only so no routing or ACLs at all. I suggested to the vendor to remove that damn restriction on all of the paging stations, but the engineers are hesitant because it could overwhelm our network. \n\nLet me just say I wasn\u2019t worried about it because we had a very robust network and everything within the airport terminal had 10GB uplinks directly to the cores. That programming on the paging stations would\u2019ve been inefficient for sure, but doable yes. The data throughput was nowhere close to our equipment limitations. It was enough to handle some audio streams for snakenet as well as hundreds of cameras. However I couldn\u2019t convince them we went back to the drawing board.\n\nWhile the vendors are focusing on paging issues the airport is experiencing, I decide to monitor the new DSPs they installed. I had a hunch the audio drops for the background music and announcements are related to some type of configuration the vendors have set up. Sure enough all of the DSPs have 100MB interfaces and one of them has all of the snakenet streams coming from it. Snakenet basically required an audio stream for every zone. As I said there were 7 zones (one stream for each zone) and each stream required about 12MB of bandwidth. So 7, continuous 12MB streams on a 100MB interface. Do the math and we are looking at a saturated 100MB interface on the main DSP.\n\nI report my findings to the vendors and they are in denial about my findings at first. It wasn\u2019t using the entire 100MB interface they tried to tell me. I retorted to the vendors if any of them had ever tried to do 5 unicasts using Ghost while trying to image 5 computers at the same time without it crashing or timing out and there were crickets. Looked my point finally got across.\n\nI ended up asking if there was a way to separate the audio streams from the main DSP. The main unit had a partner that wasn\u2019t being used at all. There was some kind of internal link between the two DSPs. So I suggested they split the audio streams by doing 3 on one and 4 on the other and it would probably eliminate the audio drop issue. Again these engineers and dev guys were taken aback before stating they would get back to us.\n\nAfter several hours go by, the onsite engineer calls me and tells me the developers opted to do my suggestion. The also enhanced the design by splitting additional audio streams over the other DSPs to overcome the paging station restriction. The vendor made it so certain snakenet audio streams were always open between certain DSPs so they \u201ctricked\u201d the system into working basically so the default paging restriction of 4 zones wouldn\u2019t be a problem. It took the development team about a day to do the new programming for our paging system, but it worked like a champ once it was implemented.\n\nI felt sorry for the onsite engineering that was still there. The gent had to stay 4 days longer than expected and I thought his fiance was going to dump him for being on the road so much that week.\n\nAnyway, I chatted with the onsite engineer for a bit after project wrapped up and I learned sometime later our FIDS\/paging vendor took my design suggestions and made them standard for all new installs. Apparently, that design also saved their asses at one or two other installation sites as well. The onsite engineer quit that vendor sometime later for a job with more stable hours and less travel. I still think that vendor owed me some kind of consulting fee, especially with the 100s of 1000s the project cost. They could\u2019ve spread a little my way, but I probably would\u2019ve been fired because of the state gift law.\n\nAnyway, I was at the airport a couple of more years after this project. The odd hours and project demand just kept on building, and I started to get burnt out. With my young family and the demand the airport put on me, my wife eventually convinced me to quit. It was a hard decision because working at the airport was never dull and I was making bank, but the constant after hours needs, projects, and on-call were taking a toll on me. I ended up finding another job with one of the local municipal suburbs and taking a huge pay cut, but it was well worth it. And by now, I have pretty much gained back what I had lost in salary so it's all good.\n\nI wish you all well and thank you for reading my long stories.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1674744709.0},{"title":"Customer solves their issue by making it worse.","author":"Bondubras","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10leux0\/customer_solves_their_issue_by_making_it_worse\/","text":"Not mine, but my dad's.

Guy lied about his actions that caused his problem. BOFH fixed him right up with a heaping helping of IT Justice \n\nwas reminded me of an incident that happened circa mid 90s by another thread so thought I would post this story up .\n\n  I was a contractor at a Gov't agency and we were converting from dumb terminals to IBM PS2s (WOOT!) running windows 3.11.  This group had fiber throughout the building and were putting fiber network cards in these things.  They also has a lab that was not being used because the boss thought what we were doing would clog up the network \\*sigh\\*. \n\nSo they had Tape machines that they would take around and load up DOS and Windows by doing an xcopy to the hard drive. they had a ridiculous goal of 3 machines a day or some such.  I was asked if I would lend a hand by the COTR (contracting officers technical representative).  since I had worked with her previously, I said sure and we labored through that group.\n\nTime came for the next group and she asked if I would help with it and I said \"nope ... nope and no\".  She asked me \"Why not\" and I told her what I thought about the way they were doing things and  followed it up with \"if you want me to help with the next group I will under the following conditions:  1) I am in charge and I get to pick which of the help desk people I worked with 2) they turn on the fiber in the lab 3) I do things my way.   you do that and I will bring the project home under budget and probably early as well. \n\nShe, being somewhat desperate, agreed.  Once the lab was turned on I went into the office and said you, you and you find something else to do.  the rest of you (3 others) come with me.  We went to the lab and I gave each of them a Network boot disk, and a 5 page monkey proof (eye roll here) instruction sheet. and then showed them how it worked.  they did ok and we went up to 7-10 a day depending on how much time I had to go back and correct their mistakes due to the apparent lack of reading comprehension skills.  But we brought it in early and under budget.  Cue the next group and I wanted to take a week off.  She said only if we got the next group done before I left.\n\nMeaning I had to get some 80 or so machines done in 5 days ... I went back and told the other three guys to find something else to do and told Carol that she was working with me that week.  Now Carol was top shelf and knew her shit.  I spent about an hour explaining what we were doing and how.  Gave her the same instruction sheet that the others had been using and turned her loose.  We did 80 machines in 5 days and I took the next week off.   \n\nnow all that is important background for this the meat of the story - We, Carol and I were making good time when I get a page.  call the guy and he is complaining that his \"applications group\" disappeared off his desktop.  after a short discussing which included me asking him \"are you sure you weren't changing things around and accidentally deleted it?\"  which he adamantly denied doing (HA!  I knew better).  so I go back to his desk reconstitute his programs group, and then made his autoexec.bat, config.sys, win.ini, programs.ini, desktop.ini, system.ini all read-only.  Said \"there you go\" showed him his programs group was there and left. \n\nNot 5 minutes later this guy is on the phone again and he is mad.  convo went something like this:   \n  Him:  I can't change anything on my desktop!  not the colors or anything! (jeez I wonder why LOL) this needs to be fixed!  \n  Me:   Well is your programs group working?   \n  Him:  well yeah   \n  Me:  well I. tell you what.  we are pretty busy trying to get these machines done.  If I can shake loose I will come buy and take another look but it might be awhile.  \n  Him:  well ok but I hope it's today  \n  Me:  no promises but I will see what I can do. \n\nI never did go back and he never called me again  Had he not lied about what he did I would have fixed his shit and pressed on.  But I KNEW he lied  especially after how little time between him being fixed and his 2nd phone call.  So, he got what he asked for and then some. \n\nMoral of the story:  Never .. Never...

These were financial companies, writing a report on a company that you might want to buy their stock, or sell, or whatever the hell those stock broker stresshogs did. And if you wanted to know what Silveman Zach was thinking about a company, we'd bought the report from them, and would sell it to you, for 25 bucks a page. \n\nThese reports were being constantly written, and we had to keep a complete archive of them for the product. No internet (we're talking late 80's here, people), fast enough to move that much type, anyways. And disk space was EXPENSIVE!! So what do you do?\n\nCompact discs. LOTS of compact discs. Like 800 discs stored at every workstation, in every major financial institution, in caddies, in carousels. Caddy? What??? [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Caddy\\_%28hardware%29#\/media\/File:Cd\\_caddies\\_JPG.jpg](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Caddy_%28hardware%29#\/media\/File:Cd_caddies_JPG.jpg) Here! Can I keep going?\n\nAnd those CD's had to be read in a drive. Or, maybe a SCSI tower of drives. Every workstation had a SCSI tower with five or six drives in it, to feed that voracious beast of a research workstation. \n\nAnd I handled the East Coast. So I was traveling from NYC to Toronto (the two major financial centers on the East Coast) just about every other day. I was literally flying to Toronto every other day. It was insane. \n\nOne day, I had just removed a workstation, tower, carousels, and 800 or so CD's, from a location a client was closing in Toronto. I got a call from the boss. \"Hey, Quadling, a client location in Virginia is having issues. Can you fly down there and fix it?\" Sure boss, what kind of issues? \"Well, the CD drives aren't working at all.\" Ok, mind if I ship this tower and workstation there so I know I have a spare? (These machines made tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars a day. No delay in fixing was allowed, and any expense that would get them up and running was automatically accepted. \n\nI shipped the tower, workstation, and just for shits and giggles, CD's, to the client.  Red label, which for some boxes that heavy? Wasn't cheap. I walked up to the airline counter, slapped my amex down, and said, next flight to Virginia, please. I was on a flight in an hour, and boy howdy, the ticket was expensive. \n\nI get there, check the PC. Works fine. The tower powers up, but none of the drives will power up. I pop the side, check the internal molex power cable, and yeah, it had come unplugged from the source. Five minutes later, it was fixed, and analysts were elbowing me to move so they could get their fix of data.  Oops, it still doesn't work!! Oh, look a SCSI terminator came loose on the cables. Ok, two more minutes, and fixed.\n\nI guessed at the time it cost five thousand dollars for seven minutes of my time.

I'm also a long term IT person - 35+ years doing a plethora of things at this point\n\nSet the wayback machine, Sherman, so the days of the late 80's\/early 90's - when men were men and ethernet networks were...slow\n\nI was part of a team which was systematically updating what were effectively stand alone sites for a rather large business which ran Novel netware, back in the days when it was a way better option for network servers than Windows NT (or Windows *Nearly There* as we called it). This place had what was then one of the largest Novel networks in the world - so large that Novel wrote custom versions of certain utilities for them to deal with the number of servers.\n\nThese were the days of thinnet - no UTP here (from memory, I don't even think 802.3i was a thing, or if it was, we certainly didn't have the budget to use recable the place using it).\n\nThe basic upgrade process was simple. Shut the joint down at close of business Friday (yay for Monday to Friday operations!), build new servers (Netware 3 - huge improvement over the 2.15 which was in place), copy data, upgrade workstations to new \"diskless boot\" magic (download the basic OS and network drivers over the network - DOS based PC's in those days), come in Monday and assist with new credentials\/logins\/minor issues, job done, move to next site.\n\nFor a place this size (6 servers, 4-500 workstations, from memory), it shouldn't have taken more than maybe 36 hours.\n\nBy today's standards, these things were slugs - single 486 processor and I think 16 meg of RAM to run the server, full length ethernet cards which ran thin net at 10 meg. Your average smartphone these days has both more processor grunt and more RAM.\n\nEverything was going swimmingly - unlit we got to server 4.\n\nServer 4 did not like us. First off it refused to see the drives - brand new, 600 meg (yes, you read correctly - meg, not gig) SCSI drives, typically two per server and in a software mirror pair (damned if I can remember what it was called).\n\nSo we pulled it apart, and found that the SCSI cable had come loose from the card - somehow it was only partially plugged in.\n\nGiven that these servers were -well, I can only say purchased from a somewhat questionable \"manufacturer\" this didn't surprise us - assembly quality from this mob was rather hit and miss - so we unplugged everything and proceeded to remove and carefully reseat everything, making sure it was all right and tight.\n\nPower her up, and Yes! The drives work. we can run the server OS installation.\n\nWe get server 4 running with manys ighs of relief, and set it off to start copying data while we moved on to more workstations.\n\nCome back a couple of hours later expecting for it to be finished - server ABEND.\n\nFreddie Uncle Charlie Katie. This is not a good thing. because of the unscheduled shutdown, it going to want to do a vrepair (Novel's answer to chkdsk or fsck) when it restarts - and that takes hours.\n\nWe decide it'll be quicker to rebuild and start again, since only about 205 of the data copied before it broke - so we rebuild it (again), get it running, and fire up the copy.\n\nThis time, one of us stayed to oversee it (yup, watching data copy - as much fun as watching paint dry).\n\nSon of a bitch got to 15% this time - and abended again.\n\nBy this point we were deep into our window, and getting a bit desperate - none of us had taken more than cat naps for something like 40 hours. Maybe we had stuffed something up putting it back together?\n\nSo we opened it up and triple checked the hardware - all plugged in, SCSI chain terminated properly at both ends (pay attention to this bit - it comes back to bite us later), we even swapped the resistor at the drive end in case it was intermittently bad and causing some issue after a while.\n\nWe rebuilt it one more time and tried again (what's that old line about the definition of insanity being trying the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result?). 20% into the copy - BOOM - abends again.\n\nCue several grown men (and one PFY) all but crying here - exhaustion was rapidly setting in, and we were running out of time - Monday morning was approaching fast, and we weren't going to finish - rolling back was a genuine *bitch* in these circumstances.\n\nAt this point the more senior members of the team went to get coffee or various other stimulants, leaving me, the PFY (although I wasn't so Y, but much more so than the other guys) along with  server 4.\n\nI decided to pull it apart one more time and give it a microscopic check. I literally removed every component (except the CPU) and examined it for several minutes before putting it back in.\n\nI found nothing out of the ordinary until I got to the SCSI controller. We were using Adaptec AHA-1542B controllers - they were normally rock solid - but I noticed something a little - weird with this one.\n\nI couldn't put my finger on exactly what it was - so I pulled out a magnifying glass and looked it over up close.\n\nThese things have three terminating resistors on the board - you can see them in [this](https:\/\/ia803108.us.archive.org\/3\/items\/adaptecaha1542b\/AHA-1542B.jpg) image at the top (I think this complies with rule 4 - if not I've done a lot of typing for nothing!) - the three little red packs near the top.\n\nOn this particular controller, one of them was backwards. The writing which indicated \"this way up\" was facing the other way to the other two.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong - these things are supposed to be omni directional - doesn't matter what way they go in, they're a 50 (?) ohm resistor pack - it shouldn't make any difference.\n\nI called the guys back and pointed it out - and, lacking any other options (we didn't have a spare card available), we pulled the offending resistor out, turned it around and put it back in the same way as the other two, plugged everything back together, rebuild, crossed out fingers and prayed.\n\nAnd blow me down with a feather, the damn thing worked. Stayed up for the whole copy. Stayed up while we got everything else done. Stayed up untilw e collapsed, utterly exhausted, around 4 am Monday morning for a couple of hours kip before the office opened at 8 am.\n\nHow we survived the rest of the day, let alone worked through any issues people had, is beyond me. All I remember is that our ultimate boss came out, too us to lunch, and refused to let us drive home - he sent us all home in taxi's at company expense (not cheap in a couple of cases) because he could see none of us were capable of driving.\n\nAnd that was when I learned that the tales of sacrificial goats being required for SCSI chains might not be the joke people in usenet made it out to be.\n\nTL:DR SCSI resistor had crisis of directional conscience and caused much havok.

I tried to keep good relationships with the teachers having been a trainer once myself, and knowing the feeling of being the one standing in front of a room of eyes all facing forwards on you. I like to think this is one of the times it paid off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a long and troubled back and forth with the supplier I managed to get an amzing deal. We had several of the older model IWBs that responded to touch, which we got upgraded free of charge to the \"laser\" type ones with invisible beams crisscrossing the surface of the board. I trained the teachers receiving these on how they worked. \"It's like those films where you have to somersault and backflip through a laserbeam corridor to steal the crown jewels, but backward. The beams detect where your pen or finger are and match it to the action you're performing\"\n\n\"Do not rest anything like IWB pens on the bottom of the board, you'll throw it off\" - yes we got tickets, yes they got reminded.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeachers, much like Garth from Wayne's World, fear change. Some would also be very positive and willing to test updates and new features given the time and opportunity to do so, very enthusiastically. But change, change is chaos. Change is the rending of garments and gnashing of teeth. Here be dragons, abandon all hope. Not even the most technically literate and progressive amongst them would have accepted the suggestion they walk into a room of teenagers with an unknown. I learned to say there would be time for training at the beginning of a sentence or I would be interrupted half way through it. \n\nAs well as the new hardware, the staff would need to be introduced to the required software update. And for their confidence make sure samples of existing teaching materials \"just work\". Cue much trepidation and reassurances. \n\nMe: \"If you really have a problem with them we'll just stick the old dodgy one back on the wall\"\n\nThat this comes as a relief to some of the teachers I hope underscores just how painful they found disruption.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring some college holiday downtime, one of our more change-sensitive teachers met the Installation Tech sent to fit them. She'd also been victim to the existing IWB's worst tempraments, she hated them. I can't express enough the stress for a teacher of a fault mid lesson. When I had them myself I had the knowledge to fix it and my delegates were IT professionals, some would even let out a cheer and we'd have a laugh about it as I sorted it out while ploughing on. For more traditional subjects and thirty odd 16 year old students, a fault is a crisis. There was only one thing worse to this Teacher. Change.\n\nInstallation Tech's job is to unbox goods, drill holes, mount equipment and naff off home. His skills for this I couldn't question. It's just a good job he wasn't in sales or support.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeacher: \"So how does this all work then?\"\n\nInstall Tech: \"Just like the old one really but with laser beams\"\n\nInstall Tech waves his hand vaguely at the board. He picks up one of the IWB pens from it's tray and mimes writing. But he's not finished the setup, the projector isn't aligned. His hand flapping spawns an entirely unhelpful squiggle across the board and wall behind it. My short time as a trainer taught me a few things and internally I'm screaming. Demonstrations should be meaningful, relevant. They should not leave questions unanswered or create new ones. There needs to be confidence in the educator, from student and teacher alike.\n\nInstall Tech: \"See? Just like that\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeacher's hands start to visibly shake as she raises them to her temples. I scrape the C in GCSE Drama off the bottom of my academic barrel. I very much deserved that C. I do not mean that with pride. I step deliberately in between them to look directly at Teacher, turning my back fully to Install Tech.\n\nMe: \"Teacher! As you can see we're still finishing up here. Why don't we clear up and I'll make sure it's all ready to go, and then we can set aside some time for a session together to make sure you are completely happy with it, is that ok?\"\n\nTeacher isn't fooled at all. My powers of diplomacy are nothing before this woman, with decades of experience with the schemes and evasions of teenagers. She smiles, a wry grin that reminds me of my grandmother, puts a hand on my shoulder and with great exaggeration thanks me. She knows exactly what I'm up to.\n\nI keep my word, the rest of the rooms are complete and their teachers shown the basics haven't changed. No wheels reinvented. Some even delight at the new features of the software.

First, threaten the computer with a powerful electromagnet. That's the funny one, for the love of DOG do not put magnets near electronic devices. Second, you guys have rebooted recently, right?\"\n\n\"I dunno. How do I check?\"\n\nI walked R through checking uptime, and I guess someone disabled updates or something because a year seems like a long time for non-servers. Not that I'd know, all my experience with anything beyond XP are my own machines. The tech had wandered off somewhere while I was on the phone, so R was able to check all the machines but one. That one the tech had disassembled for some reason. Mostly I was just surprised that the tech hadn't just started with reboot the machine! That's still step 1, right? \n\nR went ahead and rebooted one, and was thrilled when it came up and was working much better.

She even offered me a job and I explained that while I'd love one, I know enough to know that I don't know about HIPAA and backups and medical charting software. (Thanks to you guys here for teaching me this stuff in entertaining stories). I did suggest that rebooting their machines was a stopgap, it seemed odd to me that all their machines would get so slow all on the same day and there was likely something else going on, but that I didn't know enough to know what. \n\nOh, and the credit, that's 275 bucks.

These phones were extensions of a digital PABX in the capital city, they ran on something resembling ISDN. Any phone in any office in the whole state could ring another phone anywhere as if it was in the same room, all singing all dancing lots of bells and whistles, lots of buttons.\n\nWe were doing a couple of these offices a week in cities all over the place. Cablers would cable several offices over the weekend, then we would move in and mount the racks, unbox and label a stack of phones.  Then as waves of staff would head to the conference room for training on the new system we would move in and plug in and test each handset. This was all going well, but there was one woman that was too important to get out of her cubicle and go to training, she refused to move so we could set up her new phone, just continued hammering away at her keyboard. This continued until the end of the last day, she was the only one we hadn't cut over and she wouldn't move. I had a talk to the manager of the place and explained that if we didn't swap her over she would not have a phone as all the existing lines would be cancelled as soon as we finished, so he came out and told her she had to let us do the job, she was snakey as hell and didn't move, so I squeezed beside her and reached behind her computer to drop the phone cord down the back. Now at some time someone had replaced her computer and instead of firmly plugging the power in the plug was just sitting there, my guess is the computer bloke got the same treatment as we got and had to reach blindly around the back and do his best. As I reached around the back she still had whatever she had been hammering away at on the screen and as I just brushed the power plug I heard the unmistakeable sound of fans spinning down and a scream from her.\n\nBecause she had missed the training she had no idea how to use the phone so we copped a barrage of fault reports from her. She had to wait as it was obviously user error, the boss moved her to different desks but the faults went with her.  It took about three weeks before we were able to get back to her.

Naturally we refuse, as though we supply the toners staff have previously complained we've mucked up their settings when we change them. it's their bed, they can lie in it. \n $Mick doesn't like this and insists we come out. \n\nWe let this go on for a while since Mick's colleagues usually sort the problem. Then Friday 13th happens. I'm alone in my office on Fridays. Yes me, an apprentice, is left alone for a day a week. My day started to be ruined when our paper delivery failed to arrive. We run out of paper to give to staff and i put a note up. I leave for lunch, and lock my office. Relevant aside, if we have a lot of printing for the same person, I'll put it in a paper box, which is clearly marked with the staff members name and department. \n\nI return to find two things, a paper box missing (no big, I guess someone picked it up using next door's spare key), and an urgent message from IT \"You gotta see this! It's a you problem, bye.\" (paraphrased). The reference was $Mick's department office.\n\nThis poor printer. It had red lights all over it, and was making a funny noise. I open it up, noting the lack of any error numbers, just \"call service rep\". This is not normal. I open the toner bay. I find a toner for a completely different printer stuck in there and they are not interchangeable. it's made a mess of the whole bay, but somehow it is dispensing toner. I clean up what I can, make a note of the shattered plastic, and prepare to call the engineers for a conversation that will cost me dignity and the college 5 grand. But I knew there must be more seeing as it had been reported to IT that it was printing two jobs on one page, which us downright weird. I open the scanner unit, to find a massive gouge taken out of the glass plate. unsure of how that happened I log that too. That doesn't solve the two sets issue. \n\nUnless, a horrible thought occurred, they weren't using new paper. No I thought, they can't be that stupid. I open up the paper cassette and what I find was worse than I could have imagined. One, the rollers are not the ones they should be. evidently, the accountants have reached a level of confidence where they are now replacing parts themselves. which would be great, if it was the right brand(or even size). Two, they are using paper which they've nicked from my office. Paper that has already been printed. Surely they must have noticed? Evidently not. Their stolen paper worked fine, up until they reached the stapled sheets. Which has gummed the machine right up. I give up after twenty minutes of trying to pick stapled paper out of the inner workings, as they'd made it surprisingly far. \n\nI replace the rollers, and the \"waste toner unit\" (bodged water bottle), so they're two less things for the engineer to cry about. My final job is to gather the serial code and fault code(s) for the engineer. Serial code was easy enough, but fault code, good lord did the printer have a sense of humour. Instead of displaying an error code, it displayed the name of the last user to send a job, and therefore, its murderer. $Mick the Accountant. \n\nToday we had the reckoning. Engineer was here for five hours. We were honest, told him the full story. He was honest, told us we were screwed. He did what he could, then arranged for a pickup for Frankenprinter. The accountants have voided the lease and it'll cost about 5 grand to get a new printer.

A few projects over a couple of years and we had a very solid, stable setup with a good backup and DR plan. We also had a very robust network on our campus where every switch had redundant connections to the cores or a redundant edge switch.\n\nWe had a common virtualization platform and they were nice enough to throw in some complementary VDI licenses with our regular subscription. So management thought it would be a good project to go virtualize desktops. I will point out that none of the executive level went on VDI, but it was good enough for all of my other cooworkers. In our case, 50 VDI licenses gave management a good *view* on the *horizon* to complete our virtualization efforts and it just so happened it would cover all of our desktops. So when we had to upgrade to Win 7, it was done through VDI.\n\nI hate VDI and it was a pain in the ass from the get go. The amount of tailoring, licensing, and upkeep on that product was nuts. At first I was kind of excited about it, but after a couple of months working with VDI, I ended up thinking it was junk. The trouble trying to get software to work on it, get roaming profiles and\/or folder redirection working and stable, and disconnects to stop was unreal. There were additional products to buy to further complicate or \u201cbetter manage\u201d your setup with stuff like application virtualization and other fancy stuff. It was a major money pit if you ask me, like my house. During the initial days of the project I dreamt I was a PCoIP packet that was getting dropped and I had to figure out why. Anyway, after several weeks of trial and error, I got the VDI environment performing pretty solidly. At least good enough to not rip it out and just buy desktops. More expertise gained to my already full brain.\n\nBefore I get hated on, I am not saying VDI doesn\u2019t have its place in the world. I can see it for education, libraries, hospitals, and other large environments with a lot of repetitive builds. I just didn\u2019t feel it was justified for our smaller workforce. We had a hugely complex environment, but the internal network was nothing special. I didn\u2019t feel further complicating our already complex setup was warranted, but I got overruled. This was just my experience with it and my own opinion.\n\nAt some point years into virtualization and a bit of time into VDI, I was having a problem with our backup system taking snapshots of the VMs. All of a sudden, it was taking a ridiculous amount of time to snapshot something that should\u2019ve taken seconds. The snapshot delay caused weird latency issues that it was starting to make VMs unreachable for periods of time causing errors with other systems. I remember a few days before I became aware of this problem, the issue corrupted the NDIS.DIT file on our PDC preventing staff from logging in. So I ended up having to defrag the DC on New Years Day as it happened. I wasn\u2019t on call, but defragging your PDC a couple of mimosas in when you are the only one who can is a challenge. Too bad I can\u2019t put that on my resume as an example of performing under pressure.\n\nAfter the holiday, I did some research into the problem and I found the issue affected the build our hypervisor hosts were running and a patch had been released. I checked the release notes on the patch and didn't find any reasons for alarm so I went ahead and applied it to our hosts. After the patching was done, I took a backup of a VM and the issue seems to be resolved. I also tested VDI connectivity and transferring VMs to different hosts without an issue. I rebuilt a couple of the VDI VMs in the pools and once again confirmed connectivity. Lessons in VDI had made me extra paranoid about it. Everything was looking good.\n\nA couple of hours later I got a call from operations about people getting disconnected from the virtual desktops on their zero clients. Sure enough, when I went to connect to the VDI environment from my fat client, it didn\u2019t work. Same result with a zero client.\n\nI gave the VDI product support a call and was on the phone with them for hours and hours. I tell them the patch I applied and all that crap. I told them it didn\u2019t list this as a known bug or anything like that. They are utterly useless. Several hours in, it was past my bedtime and I already missed dinner with my family again because of this stupid product. At this point, I told the product support engineer I was just going to upgrade the VDI environment and hope for the best. So I just hung up on the guy and got to work. \n\nSeveral hours later, the VDI environment is upgraded to a newer version and the pools are rebuilt with the updated parent builds. I think by this time, it was past midnight. I was able to connect to a virtual desktop via the fat client and I am very happy about this. I was about to go home when I realized I didn\u2019t test connectivity out on a zero client. Sure enough, the zero client connection didn\u2019t work.\n\nAfter some additional research, I realize all 45 of our zero clients need to be flashed with new firmware to support the new version of the VDI environment. At the time, I didn\u2019t have the management tool to update all of the zero clients because it was one more thing to maintain. Luckily I had all of the zero clients on their own network segment so I could easily identify them with a ping sweep.\n\nFast forward a few more hours, I have all of the zero clients flashed with the new firmware and confirm them to be working once again. So luckily by this time, I was able to go home and take a short nap before it was time to get up and help the wife with the kids for the morning. I didn\u2019t go to work the next day except for a few calls I had to take, but by this time in my career at the airport, this type of thing happening to me wasn\u2019t uncommon so I had a routine down. Basically I fought to stay up the rest of the day, with coffee as my ally, until the early evening after dinner and then I would pass out for the night.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673907566.0},{"title":"I want my old computer","author":"flashG2009","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10du2gd\/i_want_my_old_computer\/","text":"So I used to work at an office supply \/ electronics  store doing computer repairs.

Most of programming work was spun off to another company leaving the fancy new office space empty, but we still had a lease.  A short time later the lease was up on our \"old\" space and my group was instructed to move to the \"new\" space, even though it was very inconvenient for our service techs.  My boss was told that if he could get someone to take over the lease, we could then move to someplace that made sense.\n\nAnyway, we moved in and again I started looking at things like our phone and utility bills and had the number of phone lines reduced like I had in the previous space.  I also noticed was that we were getting a gas bill.  We had not been billed for gas at our previous location, but this was a different setting so I figured it was just part of the deal.  Plus our accounting folks had been located in this building and so it must be okay.\n\nOne day I happened to enter the office through a side entrance and noted that I passed a massive gas meter.  Probably 4-5 feet tall.  It got me thinking about how many gas meters there were for the building so I walked around and could only find one.  I called the gas company and confirmed that there was only a single gas meter for the entire building.  \n\nI fired off an email to our accounting folks telling them that we were paying for 100% of the building's gas, even though we occupied about 1\/6th of the total space.  Maybe that was part of our deal with the landlord, I had no idea.  I included the phone number and name of the person I had talked to and went back to my actual work.\n\nA day or two later I got an email from our accounting manager, Jerry.  Jerry told me he had talked to someone else at the gas company, who had told him there were multiple gas meters and we were only paying for our office space, and everything was correct.  I emailed back and just said that I had walked around the exterior of the building and there was **\\*ONE\\*** gas meter.  Full stop.\n\nI didn't hear anything for a while but then got a phone call from a lady who worked in our accounting group.  She had followed up and it turned out my company had been paying for the entire building's gas since we first moved in.  We had never occupied more than a third of the building.   She needed to confirm my findings as she was working out a deal with the landlord to credit us with the overpayment.  Gas was supposed to be shared on a pro rata basis among the tenants.  \n\nIt turned out we got $50,000 credited toward our rent, and if anyone thinks I got anything beside a reputation as a troublemaker, I've a a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1673816985.0},{"title":"wrong \"power plug\"","author":"MrElshagan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10cgtnu\/wrong_power_plug\/","text":"So I'm hired as IT management\/support for two small school in Sweden, so I'm alone and moving between them every other week.

He comes the next day with a replacement board.  He swaps it out, we test print and it reboots on the first try.  Now he's concerned, there's no errors, no fault codes, just the system reboots.\n\nOver the next month he replaces the other two boards in the system and the power controller board.  Each time it fails to resolve the issue.  We tried older and newer drivers, different printers, and computers on and off the local network.

One time after replacing the last board he could a user walked up to make a copy and it reset while scanning his document.\n\nAt this point he said that they're going to have to take this machine back to the warehouse to strip it down and figure out what's going on.  A different model machine is sent to us to use while they take our machine away.\n\nThe machine was gone for over 3 months due to part shortages.  I complained a bit about how long the machine had been gone and a replacement came, another brand new machine.  The 2nd level tech came out to install it because this was now his issue to resolve.  The new machine goes in and people begin printing with no issue.

It started as a comment, but it grew enough I thought I'd make a separate post. On to the wall of text:\n\nBack in the early 2000's I was **the** field engineer for a tape backup library manufacturer of a Western State in the US. They still make tape libraries and tape drives.\n\nWe had a customer that is one of the largest processor manufacturers in the world.\n\nOne group at one of their campuses had four of our biggest tape libraries connected to some AIX hosts via fiber channel to SCSI bridges.\n\nWe had an escalation going on for over a year. Fiber channel packet capture boxes rented and connected between AIX fiber card and the bridges in the libraries. I was onsite every day copying the take from the packet captures to send back to \"Advanced Tech Support\".\n\nWhen idle, the link would reset and renegotiate about six times per second. When backups\/restores were going on, everything worked fine and the resets didn't happen. The multiple resets per second would eventually cause the fiber to SCSI bridge to randomly lock up within two to three weeks, requiring a manual reset with a paperclip.\n\nOur \"Advanced Tech Support\" engineer was running the show. IBM was involved. IBM involved the fiber channel card manufacturer.\n\nNobody could figure it out.\n\nThey knew it was something to do with FCP2 which is some sort of error correction (to my recollection).\n\nOne day, I'm poking through the configuration options on the fiber to SCSI bridge, and there's a setting to enable\/disable FC Class 2, which is disabled by default. Is it related? I dunno, I are just a service guy. Turns out kind of: FC Class 2 is for TCP\/IP over Fiber Channel (to my recollection, probably not quite correct).\n\nI approach one of the customer backup folks and tell them about the setting, admit ignorance, and suggest we try enabling it and see what happens.\n\nWe enable it on one bridge, and reboot it. When it comes up, the six times per second resets are gone. We run a test backup. It works. We run a restore of that backup, and it works. Hm.\n\nWe leave FC Class 2 enabled on that library for the weekend. Monday we checked, and the backups ran fine on that library. So we left it for a week, then for a month. And we no longer had any lock ups on that bridge. Woot!\n\nThen the backup engineer went to her boss with the story, and asked if we could roll it out to the rest of their libraries that were having this issue (only the ones connected to AIX hosts).\n\nHe let us do it, and in the next escalation meeting tore into the folks from my company about \"why didn't you suggest this a year ago?\", then the feces rolled downhill as our \"Advanced Tech Support Engineer\" tried to get me in trouble over \"making unapproved changes\" to the environment.\n\nIn the after action review conference call, the guy that was introduced as \"IBM's fiber channel expert\" asked me why I tried that setting, and I explained I was just trying it because FCP2 and FC Class 2 both started with FC and ended in 2, and I wanted to try SOMETHING instead of letting it do the same thing forever. He said \"good job\".\n\nExplanation of the issue, to my recollection, is that the driver for the fiber card expected an FC Class 1 link partner to also do FCP2 error correction. Since our bridge was talking FC Class1, but didn't do FCP2, the card kept resetting the link until the device on the other end (our bridge) WOULD negotiate that it did FCP2. Eventually the bridge would say \"I ain't talking to you no more. Neener!\" FCP2 error correction couldn't be used with FC Class 2, so if the card's link partner advertised both FC Class 1 AND FC Class 2, then it wouldn't demand FCP2, and it stopped resetting the link with our bridges.\n\nDuring this fiasco, our \"Advanced Tech Support Engineer\" would periodically tell me to make sure the bridges were configured properly. I had created a script that would capture every single setting in the bridges, including hidden ones we didn't have documented, so I would send him every setting on every bridge and ask \"here they are, how do you want them configured?\" He would never respond to that...","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673543752.0},{"title":"How to stump the professionals in 3..2..1..","author":"peach2play","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/109ecfd\/how_to_stump_the_professionals_in_321\/","text":"TL;DR at the bottom\n\nIt's been a few. For those who don't, I'm a Storage Area Network Engineer with 22yrs of experience. I currently work with $Coworker, who is a long time coworker\/friend. He's been doing this a little over 25yrs and, since we are in the same industry, we've worked on and off together since we met in the early 2000s.\n\n\nOddly enough, this environment, $MedCo, is* very well managed. Myself and $Coworker are the new kids. We've been there 2 years. Most of the people in Infrastructure have been there 5+ years and a lot of them are 10+ in. They are very good at what they do, know where all the bodies are, and know how to keep the lights on with some very sensitive equipment. \n\nOne of the most sensitive pieces of equipment, $FrankensteinsMonster, is a 6 Node Windows Dev cluster housing over 400+ disks and no idea how many instances. Microsoft doesn't allow more than 250 so there's a lot of duct tape and bailing wire holding this thing together. While it's not as sensitive as Prod, which can't even handle an sfp failure and will crash, it's still a huge pain, and gives me gray hair and nightmares. It stays up because the Windows team is incredibly good at what they do.\n\nOn to the story. \n\nCast of characters:\n$PluckySANEng == Me\n$Coworker == Friend\/Colleague\n$WinEng == 5yr Veteran and first line of defense\n$SeniorWinEng == 16ur Veteran and knows everything about this cluster\n$SeniorArchitech == knows the whole environment and is scary smart\n$PureVendor == the storage vendor\n$MSEngineer == mostly useless Microsoft engineer who had the misfortune of picking up the case\n$FrankensteinsMonster == a 6 node SQL cluster held together by duct tape and bailing wire\n\nIt's 4pm on a Saturday, and I'm on call. It's very rare I, or anyone on the team, gets a call so I decided to attend a friend's bday party 2 hrs of mountain driving from my house. Of course, Merphy's kicks in. I get a page from $WinEng.\n\n$WinEng explains they were doing patching on $FrankensteinsMonster and, when they rebooted, some, that's right, some, of its disks didn't come back. Even though 99.9% of the time missing SAN disks are not a SAN issue, I still log in and check that the Pure can see all the nodes logged in, and no removals happened in our end. Nothing. So, I let them know everything is good on our side. \n\nIt is very odd they are only missing 42 disks out of 400+\nSo, $WinEng pages out $SeniorWinEng. $SeniorWinEng suggests we check the other, smaller SQL clusters. Low and behold, they're missing some disks too. Now we're all scratching our heads. I call $Coworker to see if he's heard of anything like this as he has more sysadd experience than I do. He, too, scratches his head. At about 9:30, Sev 1 tickets to both Pure and Microsoft go out. $PureVendor calls back immediately. $MSEngineer took 5 hours. Logs are taken and sent out, while $WinEng and $SeniorWinEng try all kinds of machinations to get these disks back. \n\nWe rolled back the patches without luck. We removed disks, rebooted and reassigned them, no luck. A  lot of other things were tried, then, at about 1am, $SeniorWinEng noticed something odd. The HBA (like a NIC) software, which handles the connections from the fabric, or fiber channel network, could see the disks but MS couldn't. Now we're really confused, but maybe there's something wrong with the multipathing software which allows the server to see and use all it's redundant paths to the fabric. Uninstall, reinstall, no change. At 2am, I suggested we make a copy (snap) of the disk, break the snap, and assign the new volume. Maybe something was wrong in the identifier. Hey look, that works. Windows can now see that disk. Now we really have no idea what's going on, but we have a fix. We don't want to apply it to everything yet. What of those go offline for some reason too and we lose the cluster after we bring up instances?\n\nVendors also come back with no info. $MSEngineeris adamant that it's not an MS problem and we shouldn't keep him on the phone anymore. $PureVendor was much more helpful, and started his escalation process. At 4am we decided to call it, reconvene at 10 and get some sleep. Luckily the MS team was still in their upgrade window so we didn't have to wake the world..yet.\n\nRemember that 2hr drive I had to get home? There was no way I could get some sleep and make it home by 10. I got up at 8, called $Coworker, who is EST (I'm MST) and asked him to cover for me until I could get home.  During that time, he started looking through our db and other tools to see if he could find anything. I make it home and rejoin the call. 12hrs later, we've narrowed it down to something between the HBA and the multipathing software, but both vendors swear they found nothing. We give up for the day.\n\nMonday. Now the big bosses are involved. We have DevOps sitting on their fingers because this cluster isn't up. That costs money. About mid morning, $Coworker figures out the probable cause. We had migrated those disks from a different device using Pure's mirroring software. Then destroyed the mirror. Pure came back with, \"That's not what that mirror is for. It's for HA.\" Yeah sure, whatever.\n\nThen Pure received another case with the same issue. Then another, and another. 5 new cases in one day. They called in their dev team. 72hrs in total to discover they had a big in their code. A bug that persisted through 3 revisions.  Disks copied from one device to another using mirroring presented incorrect info to the multipathing software, causing a mismatch and a rejection.  Fix applied, all was well, everything back up. In total, it took 74 hours to resolve. \n\nNow, here's why I tell this story. We had some scary smart people on that call. I learned more about my equipment from $SeniorArchitech than I thought possible. All of us were stumped. No one, in our entire careers had ever, ever seen anything like it. While it was long hours, and lots of frustration, it was new. We all enjoyed the excitement of something new. Even with all the grief, it was one of the best, and most fun, calls I'd ever been on.\n\nTL;DR lots of scary smart people with lots of years in the business faces a genuinely new problem that none of us had seen in our careers. We proved the vendor had a bug in their code, and gave them a fix. Good times were had by all.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1673467325.0},{"title":"Well.

I'm an apprentice reprographer, and therefore deal exhaustively with that evil called printers, . I am however the most computer literate person in the department (despite being a \"techy\" field, and the IT guys at work encouraged me to share this story). This means I get asked for help with everything from \"I can't access the ordering system\", which my workplace admins had accidently blacklisted, to \"the printer's on fire\" - we don't run linux, so that worried me, but it was luckily a problem with a printing software which unfortunately has \"fire\" in the name. \n\nThen there's Bob. Bob is my machine, there are many like him, but Bob is mine. Not really, he's one of a kind, but my boss is fond of the creed. I named Bob, and you can probably guess why. He's five years old, which is about as old as high-volume machines get, and he lets us know that with various little faults and niggles. He knows we're shopping for a replacement. The biggest of these niggles is that, for a long time, we thought he was allergic to paper. \n\nIt all started with a minor issue, something with staple alignment, minor but enough that my boss made me call printer support. They in turn, with a couple of days delay, sent out an engineer. The engineer fiddled a bit, left, came back the next day with a part. Fitted the part, left. Sorted? Was it heck! Every job we printed after that jammed. Every Job. Call Printer Company Again. I'm informed that they'll come out and have a look as long as my boss doesn't at any point talk to the engineer (he's aggressive). They come out the next day, decide new part is faulty, come back three days later to replace it. Couple of test prints, all okay, but by that afternoon Bob was playing up again. \n\nThis went on for a couple of weeks. We had four different engineers come in at various times, twenty different visits, sometimes two at a time. The stapler was replaced, the puncher, the motherboard, the this, that and the other, over fifty different parts. Every time it would pass the test prints, and go wrong a couple of hours later. We had a senior engineer watch me and my boss operating the machine to see it was nothing we'd done. You know its bad when you start buying in different teas and coffees because you know preferred brands. Nothing worked. There are 37 separate Operator Accessible Paper Clearing points on Bob's model, and he'd regularly jam in 36 of them, and a couple of other places for good measure. In between visits, we'd be advised to try and use him til the next critical jam.  All through this process my boss blamed me since it happened around the time I started, the printer engineer, and God. Me, I decided Bob was allergic to paper - we were scrapping as jam waste, eight times what he'd successfully print. We went through so much paper, our supplier upgraded us from a Christmas card to a gift basket!\n\nThe engineers were out of ideas. My boss brought in a cricket bat, and a baseball bat for me. Before Bob was despatched, we'd give him one last day to redeem himself. We were busy, and that means I decided to stick the scan jobs onto Bob, only to find that that part of Bob worked flawlessly. I mentioned this to the boss, who shrugged, and I ruminated on this for a while. Why could I scan and copy on Bob, but not print from electronic sources. It wasn't the job management software - it worked on the other machines. Eventually I narrowed my target to the banner sheet. It would always jam between the banner sheet and the job proper (sometimes elsewhere but always there). Told the boss, who didn't believe it was possible. Told the engineer, who'd never heard of it before. He called colleagues, tried to explain it, couldn't (or couldn't be arsed) got me to, and came up with precisely nothing. He Left with the promise of consulting for a solution with Head Office. \n\nMeanwhile I was being told to send anything and everything through Bob to work out tolerances. I actually managed to find a bodge fix - sending the banner sheet after. Simple as that, after all that work. Printer engineer decided this was good enough. We still haven't worked out a permanent solution, but I'm prouder than I should be of my trial and error. \n\nI've done more impressive support (fixing a binding machine, and working out why our job dispatching software was automatically doubling some jobs) but Bob, the little machine that *still* won't is the boss' go to reason for bothering me rather than actual IT, so I thought you might be interested.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1673390843.0},{"title":"The Airport - Part 3","author":"PersimmonOdd3806","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/108kojb\/the_airport_part_3\/","text":"This story is a prime example if anyone ever needed to justify a change control solution.\n\nWhen I first started at the airport, they were in the middle of constructing a new bag management\/handling system (BMS or BHS). I think the project took almost 2 years to complete because of all the inner workings. Like everything in the airport, it had to be intertwined with something else. So the airport ended up owning the servers and PLCs that were the brains of the operation. And then there was a non-networked type of interface that passed data along to a certain bag checking federal entity. The bag system was an HA pair of servers only and a PLC running each bag belt. There were other components as well, but they aren\u2019t important to this story.\n\nThe HA setup worked surprisingly well except every time we changed servers for maintenance or something, a certain federal bag checking entity would have to reboot their side of the interface in order for it to work..every\u2026single\u2026time. I do however remember one time the HA cluster did suffer a split-brain situation and that wasn\u2019t fun to sort out, but I digress.\n\nThis started out one afternoon when I got a call from operations saying the BMS was down. Every PLC controller was giving an error about a duplicate IP issue. We were standardized on one particular type of networking equipment exclusively that had recently released a version of code that resulted in the same IP duplicate error that took down the same system along with other systems. We found the bug after about an hour and implemented the bug fix on every switch and it went away. However yet here we are again in a deja vu situation several weeks later.\n\nI double check every single switch and port to make sure the bug fix is still implemented and it is. It took me hours to comb through all that stuff to confirm that still wasn\u2019t an issue. So I am racking my brain trying to figure out what the hell is going on and why the PLCs are shooting this error. I am looking at the ARP tables on the core, clearing everything out, and anything else I can think of. It all looks good from what I can see. I shut down both of the main servers and all the damn devices on that network segment to complete a ping sweep and I am seeing nothing return as I would expect. I power all the devices back on one at a time to account for them all and it all checks out. At this point I am grasping at straws.  I am super perplexed because the last time the duplicate IP bug happened, it affected multiple systems we had. And in this situation, it was just the PLCs of BMS which was just weird.\n\nBy now the problem is catching the attention of the highest level of airport management and other federal entities. They are starting to come down to get a briefing and generally getting in the way by interrupting my thoughts. I am kind of starting to panic because I am really starting to run out of ideas as to what could be causing this duplicate IP issue that is killing the PLCs and therefore the whole shabang. Bags are piling up and the airport had to institute the manual backup plan by having the porters cart the bags back to the baggage area.\n\nMy boss sees I am struggling after a couple of hours of this and calls a team meeting. We all go through our entire day in in-depth detail as to what each of us did that day. Nothing too significant except one of my team members had hooked up a new switch in a newly constructed tenant building. The port the new switch got hooked up was not configured properly as a trunk port so it defaulted to an automated type of programming.\n\nI immediately shut that damn port down. I missed it earlier because I wasn\u2019t looking for that type of programming and I didn\u2019t know anything about bringing that new switch online. The other team members normally told me when a new switch was going to be coming online so I could make sure it was operating as expected. Anyway the BMS system comes back online almost immediately after reseating the NICs in the PLCs and everyone celebrates. I get the switch port programmed correctly and we bring the new switch online as well a couple of days later without any issues.\n\nTo this day I am not totally sure what caused the issue from a technical standpoint. I am not sure if it was some kind of looping issue with STP or a BPDU when the switch port defaulted its config. I figured if that were the case, we would be seeing other oddities around the network, but it was just the BMS system PLCs.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673384057.0},{"title":"It took a single phone call","author":"ascii4ever","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/108h5sd\/it_took_a_single_phone_call\/","text":"Inspired by MSPSDManager\n\nBack in the 80s I was a tech support supervisor for a company in Southern California.  I worked out of an office that housed not only my group but s team of programmers, plus our accounting, sales, and managerial staff.  \n\nWe had an office in a business park which we totally filled.  After a year or so we had to rent additional office space in another suite in the same park.  We kept this space for while until we could figure out a way to move everyone back into the main office.  \n\nThings were really booming so we started looking for more \"fancy\" office space that could house everyone.  Most of folks wanted to move to an area further from the main metro area to be closer to their homes.  My group wanted to stay in office we were in since it was closer to our customer base.\n\nEventually we found a new building that was under construction and we made a deal to lease an entire floor and the landlord gave us an great building allowance to customize the space.  Finally the day arrived and everyone except the support group moved out. \n\nA lot mail still got delivered to the \"old\" office, most of which we just bundled up and delivered to the \"new\" office.  Some bills that were for our space had be approved by us before we sent on to the accounting folks for payment.   I got the job of making sure things got forwarded and approved and this was when I discovered were getting multiple telephone bills. \n\nOne bill was for \"calling cards\" used by our remote techs so they could call us and customers no matter where they were.  Remember this is the days when \"long distance\" calls were expensive.  But I also found we were getting two different bills from our local phone company.   One of them was for our regular land lines, it was set up with multiple lines on a \"hunt group\" so multiple incoming calls could be handled.  No big deal but since we had way fewer people in the office now, we didn't need as many lines.   The other bill had some strange stuff listed I never seen before, they weren't normal phone numbers.  \n\nI called the phone company and gave them the information and after a bit I was told these were for leased phone circuits, the kind used for dedicated modem connections.   They stuff we used before the internet to connect computers to each other.   I got my contact to get me the two physical addresses and it turned out that this service was between our office and the \"temporary\" office space we had leased.  We had vacated that space months ago, but we were still paying for the service.  \n\nAnyway, I cancelled the data circuits and had the number of voice lines reduced, resulting in some savings, which my boss appreciated.  Just a little thing but I felt like someone should have caught it before me.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1673375694.0},{"title":"Ah yes, can I login to my new laptop without a login?","author":"LackingAce","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/108iy48\/ah_yes_can_i_login_to_my_new_laptop_without_a\/","text":"Hi OP and co-worker,\n\nI received my company laptop today, but still don\u2019t have a login (\"My boss\" suggested I let you both know that I have received the laptop).\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure of the process, but do I need to wait until I get my login credentials before the laptop can be used?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThanks,\nFinicial Manager\n\n\n-Next email-\n\n\nYes, this would be the case.

On my first day, I \"fixed\" the internet (plugged an ethernet cable into a switch) and a week later was hired as the full time Customer Service and IT manager. Two clearly disparate jobs, but whatever, marginal pay raise and I make my own schedule. Win win, right?\n\nA few months go by, I mostly do CSM work with some occasional first line work, ala \"the internet doesn't work!\" (generally an unplugged UPS) or website maintenance (setting up widgets on wordpress).\n\nI have never had an IT job before. I am decently tech literate (thanks LTT), built my own PC, have some basic understanding of networking, and consider myself to be a decent problem solver. \n\nIt's a small, local business, how hard can it be, right? Fake it til you make it. Plus, I know how to use this very helpful tool, google.com. Believe it or not, if you have a problem, you can type it into google.com and it will usually produce helpful information. Nifty! Since askjeeves.com is no longer available, I use google.com.\n\nThis is where the fun begins.\n\nOur company pays an non-insignificant amount of money to an outside contractor for enterprise, managed high-speed internet. Our environment is fully networked, and for its location, extremely capable. This would be completely fantastic, if not for the fact that every few months, PEOPLE UNPLUG EVERYTHING and move it to new spots. Guess who's job it is to reconfigure IP's for every networked device when that happens?\n\nAnyway, we get more or less to;\n\n**The Story:** A little while ago, I set up an IT help desk application so staff can submit tickets for IT issues, as well as maintenance and administrative tasks. This is significantly easier to keep track of than the hundreds of emails and handwritten notes people give me. I set it up on everyone's workstations, gave a demo on how to use it, explained its features, etc. Everybody is going to use this, right?\n\nNext day, around 7pm, new email from $Marketing:\n\n$Marketing: Please do X task and have it ready by tomorrow 9am\n\nI respond: Sounds good! Submit a ticket and I'll have it done asap.\n\n$Marketing: (~9pm that night) This is not a helpdesk issue. Have X task done tomorrow.\n\nMe: I went ahead and took care of X task for you, but in the future, please try to use the helpdesk for non-urgent matters. If I do non-urgent tasks via email, nobody will use the help desk, and then tasks will get lost in the shuffle. This is a very useful tool to help me stay accountable and notify you when tasks are completed.\n\n$Marketing: No. I am not going to jump through hoops to get in contact with you for things I need done. Your help desk does not mean that email is no longer valid for communication. It's not my responsibility to keep track of your tasks for you. 'I was not going on [software] to go through a 10 step process so you have a ticket in a to do list to get to at your leisure when all I needed to do was forward you an email for you to print.' (this person, when they are in the office (which is rarely) has a desk next to the office printer)\n\nMe: As I said, I have taken care of this for you per your email. Non-urgent tasks sent to my email are considered low-priority and will be handled after help desk tickets. Use whichever seems appropriate to you given the circumstance.\n\nNo reply. I may be in the wrong here given my lack of experience, but outright refusal to use a tool I set up for a specific purpose the first day it's implemented seems a bit childish to me. Maybe I'm the asshole here, I don't know, feel free to shred me to bits in the comments if I am.\n\nI share this with the head of the company (aka my $Supervisor), who then explains that $Marketing throws temper tantrums like this often and that they ($Supervisor) love the help desk.\n\nA few weeks prior, we underwent the dreaded \"unplug every network cable in sight and make me set everything back up\" fiasco. No worries, I get everything working. We lose power, everything breaks, I fix it all. Again, no sweat. A little annoying, but hey, it's IT right? Things happen.\n\nYesterday, we open for business. One new ticket; Please set up new office printers. \n\nFantastic, I can set up a printer! I'll look really good in front of the boss, using acronyms like TCP\/IP and opening to command prompt to ping the IP address, I'll look like a certified hacker! \n\nFirst printer install goes great. Second printer during setup is insistent it has a paper jam, despite having no paper in it. [Printer Company] support tool, for the \"help me with a printer jam\" option, states: Remove jammed paper. Can I help you with something else?\n\nEnded up taking the whole thing apart, doing xyz checks, hard reset, no luck, PAPER JAM PAPER JAM PAPER JAM. Whatever, shit happens, RMA.\n\nThird printer seems fine, ends up with some looping 'setup incomplete' error. Two hours of troubleshooting, get in touch with [printer company] support. First tech asks for my name\/company\/issue, I answer, tech promptly disconnects for stated reason 'customer left chat'. Sends me an email with a link to reconnect, support application softlocks itself, then gives me a message 'chat session ended. Thank you!' Receive another email saying the issue has been resolved.\n\nOh well, these things happen. Try again with support. Connected for an hour or so, am instructed to do all the things I've already done (turn it off and on again, reset, firmware update etc.). Tech then instructs me to do something that I *know for a fact will BRICK the printer*. I ask them to confirm, tell them that it will brick the printer if I do it, and they tell me to proceed, so I do. The craziest thing happened next.\n\nIt bricked the fucking printer.\n\nI tell the tech this, they immediately disconnect and the support app crashes again. So we RMA 2\/3 brand new printers. Hey [printer company], get it together! (aka fuck you)\n\nJust when I think printer hell is over for the day, I get back to my computer and a new help desk ticket shows up.\n\n'Receipt printer not working'. Fantastic. I go and fix that printer. Takes ~15 minutes. \n\nGet back to computer. 3 new tickets. Can you guess what they're for?\n\n3 bad receipt printers and a bad ticket printer, in 3 separate locations on site. At this point I want to throw every printer in the trash and just email people their receipts, but hey, at least people are using the help desk, right? Two printers needed to be reconfigured with new IPs, because despite the DO NOT UNPLUG labels on everything, all the printers were unplugged and shuffled around at some point prior and I had missed them during my previous reset. One printer was just unplugged, and another was just off.

They launched a wider audit and found they were paying for a handful of services they had long stopped using.

When I was setting up the connection I did a WiFi scan to see what was broadcasting in the area and to see if any of there were any FON hotspots (cheaper at the time than cellular data), and I found an unsecured internet connection called \"Jones Belkin Router\". This was well into the late 2000s when even ISP provided routers were configured with at least WEP. I was able to connect to the network and see that he had a PC and a laptop with shared folders wide open on each, and a printer. There was basically no security on this network - even the router password was just the default. I disconnected, connected to my phone to check my emails and then logged off.\n\nAbout a week later I was getting home from work, unlocking the front door and I met Mr Jones for the first time as he came out of his front door. He introduced himself, I introduced myself and we had the usual new neighbour chat. I remembered the unsecured network and decided to ask him about it.\n\nMe: \"Sorry, I have to ask, is the Jones Belkin Router network yours?

Apologies for length, trust me, I've abridged this.\n\nOur cast of characters:\n\n**Me**, your humble narrator\n\n**ProfessorB**, on the faculty of my department.  Always professional with me but has a reputation for being extremely stubborn under a veneer of reasonableness.  \n\n**ProfessorA**, on the faculty of a different department.  Extremely stubborn and inflexible, and does not care what temperature revenge is served out at.\n\n**$DH**, in other posts I've done he's **$bigboss**.  Very smart guy but not a great administrator, does not like dealing with management issues.  \n\n**$Mike**, Department Head of **ProfessorA**.  Actually a totally cool guy, great sense of humor, actually does stand up comedy as a side gig. \n\n**$N**, lab assistant for **ProfessorA**, like me she's caught in the middle of this farce.\n\nOne of my collateral responsibilities was the department equipment inventory.  All assets worth over a certain dollar value had to tracked and accounted for every year.  In my case it almost all computers with a few other items, like expensive furniture, thrown in.  Since it was mostly computers, I ended up with this project, most other departments (who had way fewer items) assigned this task to one of the clerical staff.\n\nAnyway, one day I get a call from **ProfessorB**.  He says since I'm the inventory monkey, he'd like me to track down a laptop.  Kind of a strange request, but the details soon reveal a real mess.  **ProfessorB** loaned this laptop to **ProfessorA**, who is in a different department but is also someone he was doing joint research with.   \\*However\\*, **ProfessorB** and **ProfessorA** are married and in the process of getting divorced.  And no, this is NOT a friendly parting of the ways.  **ProfessorB** has tried to get this laptop back since he has a new graduate student joining his team and he wants to give it to this new student.  **ProfessorA** basically will not talk to him, ignores his calls and emails, and told him to take a running f\\*ck at a rolling doughnut.  So, me being the inventory guy, can \"officially\" ask **ProfessorA** to return the laptop.  **ProfessorB** explains this all to me in a calm and professional manner, nothing to get excited about, it should be a piece of cake.\n\nI don't see a way to dodge this request, inventory IS my responsibility.  I look up the laptop in our database, its several years old, nothing fancy at all.  Clearly this isn't really about the laptop, **ProfessorB**  could buy a new one for his student, he has plenty of funding.  This is about sticking it to his soon-to-be ex.  Arg.  I've met **ProfessorA**, she is not an easy person to work with.  Everything is \"my way or the highway\" with her.  With a sense of impending doom I fire off an email to **ProfessorA**, asking politely when would be a good time for me to pick up the laptop since **ProfessorB** needs it back.\n\nAnd hell empties as all the devils descend on me.\n\n**ProfessorA** calls me.  I am subjected to a thiry minute tirade about how horrible **ProfessorB** is.  He could solve this issue in one second, if he wanted to.   He's just being stubborn, and mean, and he's a terrible person.  This goes on and on, I keep asking about getting the laptop back.  She ups the ante by telling me that **ProfessorB** has some equipment that belongs to her, and he hasn't returned it and **NOTHING** will happen until that is done.  This is all new information, so I tell her I'll follow up on this and discuss things with **ProfessorB.**  It also turns out that **ProfessorA** is actually at a conference in a different city so it might be difficult to reach her.\n\nI email **ProfessorB**, he responds that he doesn't see what one issue has to do with the other.  **ProfessorA** has to return the laptop.  I assume its clear to one and all that both these folks are on pretty high horses, and no one is thinking about climbing down.  I explain that he may very well be correct, but maybe this is the easiest way to get the f\\*cking laptop back.  We do not track the equipment that **ProfessorA** wants back, its a couple of semi fancy monitors.  After some discussion, **ProfessorB** decides to task one of his students to go through the paperwork to see if we can find them.  Turns out this student actually finds the paperwork including serial numbers, and I can collect them from **ProfessorB**'s lab and exchange them for the laptop.  We're in \"**Bridge of Spies**\" territory.\n\nI email **ProfessorA**, I have the monitors, can I bring them over and get the laptop?  **ProfessorA**'s lab is in the building next door.  I get a response.  Now I'm informed that **ProfessorA**  also wants a computer back.  **ProfessorA** has no information on it, model number, serial number, or University asset tag number.  It had a hostname of **$L**, and **ProfessorB** knows which one it is and if it isn't returned, no laptop.  I tell her I need more information to see if I can track this down.  **ProfessorA** tells me she has no information but **$ProfessorB** knows what she is talking about and he can find the computer in two seconds if he would just make the effort.\n\nI go back to **ProfessorB** with the latest demand.  He hits the roof.  He recycles hostnames so he has no idea which computer she is talking about.  He says she's making this up, and besides, these issues are not related.  It's his laptop and he wants it back.  I need to do whatever I need to do to make this happen!\n\nAt this point I get on the phone to the University Property Department.  I get someone in management on the line and explain my situation.  Manager Person groans.  This is not her first rodeo apparently.  I need to escalate to **$DH**.  He can contact the **$Mike**, they can try to work it out.  If that doesn't do it, we'll take to the two Deans.  If that doesn't do it, the Provost's office.  Maybe the University Legal office will need to be roped in.  I'm totally depressed by this time.  This laptop is worth a couple hundred bucks tops.  I almost want to buy one on Ebay out of my own pocket just to make this go away.  But then I think, \"screw this\".  If the University want to pay me, a senior sysadmin, to deal with a couple of prima donna professors, So Be It.  So, I jump back into the Rabbit Hole and resume my tour Wonderland.\n\nI write the whole thing up in an email, send it to **$DH**, cc my boss and **ProfessorB**.  I am careful to make no value judgements, just the facts ma'am.  **$DH** tries to contact **$Mike,**  he's out of the office on jury duty.  I'm to contact **ProfessorA** again.  Tell her I am bringing her monitors over and I'll be expecting to pickup the the laptop.  All this goes into an email and a few minutes later my phone rings.\n\n**ProfessorA** is on the line and outraged.  She will not give the laptop back, in fact, she **\"hopes nothing bad will happen it\"**.  I ask where it is, is it on campus?  Its \"somewhere in our\\_city\".  I tell her I'm working on instructions from **$DH**.  She could not care less.  **$DH** \"is not the boss of her\".  I'm totally astounded, its like I'm dealing with an eight year old.  She tells me once I have ALL her equipment delivered to her lab, **$N** will provide the laptop.\n\nThere was a whole side mission about trying to scrape up an old desktop computer to see if we could pass it off as **$L**, but eventually it was decided that this was **Too Stupid For Words**.  In the end I loaded the monitors (old CRT types, like 60 lbs each) on a cart and took them over to the other building.  There was one spot where I had to unload the monitors and carry them up a couple of steps, then drag the cart up the steps and reload the monitors.  Joys of older, non-ADA compliant buildings.\n\nI got to **ProfessorA**'s lab with the monitors and met **$N**.  She was a very nice young lady, seemed as embarrassed as I was by this entire charade.  I explained that I had the monitors, I would like the laptop.   **$N** says sorry, she has instructions, no **$L** computer, no laptop.   Okay, she's following her boss's orders, nothing for it.\n\nI wheel everything down the main office in this building and ask if there's a room I can leave the cart and monitors overnight since it was almost 5PM and didn't want to lug the monitors and cart down the steps.  I go back to my office, write up another email to **$DH**, and go home.  Later that evening I get a reply from **$DH**, I'm to see him first thing the next morning.  He's been in contact with **$Mike** by email, hopefully we'll be able to wrap this up.\n\nNext morning I check in with **$DH**, he is totally pissed off but he's talked to **$Mike**, and we're ready to resolve this.  **$DH** and I stroll over to the other building, **$DH** is muttering the whole time.  I feel the same as he does, this whole thing is **Just So Dumb**.  Two grown people, University professors, can't resolve their petty differences and have dragged all of us into this crazy situation.\n\nWe meet with **$Mike**, who is just as amazed by the whole thing as we are.  He has talked to **ProfessorA** and got the same treatment I did.  A 30 minute phone call explaining that **ProfessorB** was the Devil Incarnate.  Why couldn't we all see it?  Its like **ProfessorB**  had cast spells on all of us so couldn't see how Evil he was!   But **ProfessorA** isn't fooled!   She knows **The Truth**!  And she will make **ProfessorB** pay in blood!\n\nI retrieve the cart and monitors from the storage room and we ride the elevator up to the lab.  **$Mike** is mostly laughing things off, I'm glad someone is enjoying this cause I'm sure not.  **$N** is in the lab, **$Mike** politely asks her for laptop.  **$N** politely hands the laptop to **$Mike**.  **$Mike** hands the laptop to me and asks me to verify that is the correct unit.  I check the asset number and confirm that this is the laptop in question.  So **$N**'s yardarm is clear, she gave the laptop to **$Mike**, NOT to me.   I unload the two monitors and we exit the lab.\n\nBasically **ProfessorA** and **ProfessorB** were like a pair of scissors.  They could spend all day going snip-snip-snip at each other without doing either of them any harm.  But God help any poor soul that got between them.\n\nThere's a sequel to story, but this is Long Enough!","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1673118568.0},{"title":"Vendor and client insist their postage meter just stopped working out of the blue, and it's our firewall's fault.","author":"LawbstahRoll","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/1055bfz\/vendor_and_client_insist_their_postage_meter_just\/","text":"I'll try to make this short, but it's so infuriating.\n\nThe user calls up on an existing ticket that a colleague of mine had been working earlier in the day but he had to stop working due to being sick.

Quick background on this, the airport has paid wifi from a company. They blast the SSID out of every access point they have to make money off of it. It is free for a certain amount of time with ads unless you pay for it of course. It\u2019s a pretty good deal in that the company actually provides wifi equipment to the airport, the airport manages it, and it is worth tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nOne day I got a ticket from a civil servant at the Air Traffic Control (ATC aka the FAA) tower saying they can\u2019t connect to the paid wireless. The airport had equipment in the tower for some emergency phone stuff and cameras for the runways, taxiways, ramp, etc. However there was no wireless presence in the tower itself.\n\nI went to visit the ATC and this individual told me they hadn\u2019t been able to connect to the paid wifi for the better part of a week and that\u2019s it. The person precedes to tell me the FAA internet connection is too damn slow to really do anything. Last I talked with my FAA counterparts I knew the tower and the FAA admin building was running off a T1 line so that is REALLY slow. So the paid wifi was working and now it isn\u2019t. And I tell the person I am perplexed how they were even using the paid wifi in the first place since the civil servant\u2019s office is like 7 stories off the ground and the airport has no APs nearby.\n\nI left the tower totally confused and went back to the office to chat with my team. At the time, our team collectively knew the entire technological history of the airport. Trust me there\u2019s a lot of stuff and I still get an occasional call even after years of not being there about how something was set up. After some debate and looking at coverage maps we figured out the FAA person was connecting to an external AP hanging off a building over 100-ish yards away. I went back to the area to scope it out and found the problem. I ended up back at the tower to see the FAA person and pointed them to look out their office window. I showed them where the connecting AP was located and the reason why the ATC person couldn\u2019t use it was because there was a huge metal tail rudder of a private jet blocking it. The ATC person was pissed and I chuckled all the way back to my office.\n\nI will share some other stories in the coming weeks including the paging system upgrade gone wrong, bag handling system outages, and more common use stories.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673017839.0},{"title":"Don't Know My Own Strength","author":"Agile_Guide_7050","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/104wcse\/dont_know_my_own_strength\/","text":"I've been working in public libraries for 35+ years, 25+ in IT. I've seen some interesting things.\n\nThis happened yesterday. TL;DR at bottom.\n\nOn Tuesday one of my ancient rack-mounted UPS units indicated to me (loudly) that the batteries had failed, not unusual after several years since the last replacement. I ordered the new batch immediately, and they were shipped via ground, not surprising for something that ways about 45 pounds (20 kilos). What was surprising is that they arrived this morning, after being shipped from Pennsylvania to far north suburban Chicago.\n\nI took the box down to the server room, deep in the depths of the building, and opened up the UPS. Old batteries came out, easy-peasy. First set of new batteries went in, a little wrestling with the harness (as always) to make room for the second set, a little wrestling with the second harness so the door will close, no problem. Closed the door, done.\n\nWhenever I install new batteries into a UPS, I like to give it a test, to clear the battery warning and make sure all the wiring is correct. To do so, on this unit, you hold down the \"On\" button (the line button, as one of my co-workers called it, as opposed to the circle. She was pleased when I explained that that is really 0 and 1, and said that made much more sense). Simple, Straightforward, easy, right?\n\nI started to hold down the button, and it is pushed into the UPS with a cracking sound. In the process, my finger slipped and I accidentally hit the \"Off\" (0, circle) button, which pushed further into the unit. I can no longer push either button, they have disappeared inside. In addition, I have shut off power to all the network equipment in the building: switches, routers, firewall. Needless to say, my phone immediately starts ringing, because \"the Internet's down!\" Plus all the other notifications that pop up when the network fails. \"Yes, I'm aware that the Internet's down!\"\n\nI took the front bezel off the unit, and there's the PC board with the buttons and lights, dropped inside, still attached to the ribbon cable. I jabbed the now uncovered \"on\" button, and, thankfully, the unit powers up, and we are back in business. Unfortunately, the plastic of the bezel was so brittle from age that several of the clips that hold the PCB to the bezel are just gone, lost in the depths of the UPS.\n\nAfter some juggling with the short ribbon cable, PCB, lens, button cover, and bezel, I was able to put it back together using the unbroken clips (two of four) and some electrical tape. Unfortunately, in the process of reattaching the bezel, the plastic tabs holding the friction clips also shattered, leaving a long tab and a single screw as the only things holding the bezel to the unit. Still, it is working, and the bezel is reasonably well-attached.\n\nI am not too confident about the fix, but I got permission from my director to replace this unit and its partner, both of which were purchased in 2004 (before I started working here). Still, they've been good donkeys and deserve their retirement.\n\nTL;DR: Bezel shatters because of a button press.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673017395.0},{"title":"Back on the help desk, Part 3","author":"lawtechie","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/1049uc8\/back_on_the_help_desk_part_3\/","text":"Part 1 is [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/z7jatb\/back_on_the_help_desk\/)  \n  \nPart 2 is [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zgjcrd\/back_on_the_help_desk_part_2\/)  \n  \nI\u2019m doing security consulting again, and a twit has decided to rub his shiny SUV up against my not-so-shiny motorcycle.  \n  \nI learn the following:  \n  \n1.

He\u2019s much less irritated now.   \n  \nI make my way back to the help desk bullpen and try to get back to my actual work. One of the other denizens of the bullpen makes eye contact with me.

I wanted to interface with you before the day ended\u201d  \n  \nI can\u2019t tell if Mark is trying to talk to me, have sex with me getting me to install a RJ-45 in my brainstem. I\u2019m about to pay more attention to Mark, but my phone rings. It\u2019s Howard, the recruiter who got me this job. This is likely important. I put a hand up to motion to Mark that I need to take this call.  \n  \nMe:\u201dHi Howard. How\u2019s it going?\u201d  \n  \nHoward:\u201d Heeeyyy, LT.

Said a scary biker type threatened him\u201d  \n  \nOh, no.  \n  \nI can hear the blood rush in my ears. Mark\u2019s still talking, oblivious to my phone conversation.  \n  \nI stand up and put my hand over my phone.  \n  \nMe:\u201dMark, I have to take this. I\u2019ll be back to talk to you in a bit\u201d  \n  \nI walk out to find somewhere quiet to talk with Howard.

The teal and lemon paint scheme is an effective supporting cast.   \n  \nHoward pipes up:\u201dSo, Charles said you insulted him\u201d  \n  \nMe:\u201dWell, that sounds like me. What should I be doing?\u201d  \n  \nHoward:\u201dIs there work you can do elsewhere? Like in another state?\u201d  \n  \nMe:\u201dHuh. I do have some site audits as a part of this engagement. I\u2019ll set them up and go on the road\u201d  \n  \nHoward:\u201dExcellent. I knew you\u2019d have a solution. You\u2019ll need to submit tickets to get time with the teams at the branch offices. Go through the travel agency for plane tickets and hotels\u201d  \n  \nMe:\u201dMind if I drive rather than flying?\u201d  \n  \nHoward:\u201dI don\u2019t care, as long as the work gets done\u201d  \n  \nMe:\u201dGreat. Let the client know that I\u2019ll be out of range of Charles in twenty minutes\u201d  \n  \nHoward:\u201dAwesome. By the way, did you call Charles a \u2018no empire having jackass\u201d  \n  \nMe:\u201dThat sounds like me. Scary biker type really doesn\u2019t.\u201d  \n  \nHoward laughs and hangs up.  \n  \nI walk back and start gathering my stuff. Mark\u2019s there, still eager to interface.   \n  \nMe:\u201dHey, Mark. I need access to our ticketing system. Who do I ask?\u201d  \n  \nMark:\u201dI\u2019ll take care of it and enroll you in everything you need\u201d  \n  \nMe:\u201dThanks, so much, Mark. Great meeting you\u201d  \n  \nFor some reason, Mark seems shocked at my packing up and running out the door to prevent any potential Charles issues. I throw on my jacket, helmet and ride to a local coffee shop to send tickets for my site visits.   \n  \nDespite an eventful day, I\u2019m looking forward to riding home.

As with many websites, a new website was in the works, so the old website had to be kept limping along until the shiny new one was ready for prime time. And by \"old\", I mean it: the original website had been launched 9 years before!\n\nDue to its age, we constantly ran into limitations, but the one that really hurt the most was that the server hardware was hopelessly out-of-date and was starting to fail. The physical hardware was co-located at an external provider, and it made logical sense to move the servers into the cloud. So we did so.\n\nWe worked through a couple of major issues, such as the one caused by a third-party vendor. This third-party vendor was owned\/managed by a personal friend of the newly-hired client IT Director, and he insisted that this other company be involved in the planning and sizing stage. Unfortunately, they sized the database server for the website at 1\/2 the size it should have been, and nobody caught it. Well, shame on us, but we got it resolved.\n\nWe got all the issues resolved and things were fine. Or so we thought.\n\nNear the end of the summer, things started happening. The site became bogged down and unresponsive. We had two servers that were load-balanced, but every now and then, one or the other of the servers would stop handling requests and would roll over and play dead. So we restarted the Application Pool and everything was great.\n\nUntil it happened again. And again. And again.\n\nMy life became a living nightmare that followed this schedule:\n\n1. Our European users would try to access the website in the morning. If there was a problem (and, sadly, there usually was), they would send me an email.\n2. Around 3:00 or 4:00 AM, I would get up to go to the bathroom (hey, I'm old, it happens!) and check my email. Dang, gotta pass this along to our DevOps guy. So, off it would go. (By the way, the client was not paying us for instantaneous 24-hour support, which is a little weird given that it was an international site with content in all the major European languages and also Chinese.)\n3. At 7:00 AM, I was at the bus stop waiting for my bus and I would check my email to see if the DevOps guy had gotten my email. Usually, he had not.\n4. At 8:00 AM, when I got into work, I would check my email again, and at 8:15 AM, I would call the DevOps guy and ask him to log in and restart the IIS App Pool. He would do it and I would notify the European team that everything was back up. By this time, the European team would have been unable to do their work for approximately 3-4 hours.\n5. (I would also renew my request to be given access to the servers so I could log in and do this from home, but upper management always rejected my request.)\n\nI was the sole programmer\/support developer person on this website. Yes, I was the \"system administrator\", but I was not given physical access to the environments, so my system administration privileges were very limited.\n\nI wrote a program that I was allowed to put onto the web servers. These programs would ping themselves and try to access a given page. They were set up to do this every 5 minutes. If they did not receive a response, then they would go into a ping-every-15-seconds mode. If they did not get a response after the 4th ping, then they would automatically restart the IIS App Pool.\n\nThis reduced the downtime from 3-4 hours to approximately 6 minutes. Better, but why were the darn things dying so much?\n\nI was doing everything I could, including asking for any and all web logs and supporting files. The DevOps guy was sick and tired of handling my requests, but he dutifully zipped up the logs and sent them to me.\n\nOnce I started trying to analyze the files, I realized we had a problem. The log files would not fit into my editor's memory because they were way too big. Uh oh.\n\nI did some tricks and finally got into the files. What I found made my heart sink.\n\nThis poor little website that was sized to handle maybe 10,000 -- 20,000 visits per day was getting absolutely hammered by Baidu crawls. We were getting upwards of 7 million web requests each and every day on both servers.\n\nWhen I dug into it, I saw some really weird URLs. Let's pretend like the website was called \"foobar\\[dot\\]com\". I saw traffic for \"aaa.foobar\\[dot\\]com\", \"aab.foobar\\[dot\\]com\", \"aac.foobar\\[dot\\]com\", and so on, working its way from \"aaa\" to \"zzz\". Each of our hundreds of products across all the languages (more than 10 languages) were being requested, each going from \"aaa\" to \"zzz\". Over and over and over again.\n\nBased on the requestor's information, there were at least 10-20 different Baidu crawlers.\n\nWe finally talked to the client's marketing team in China and found out they had requested that our site be crawled by Baidu for the China market. However, they had not configured it correctly, and it was crawling all of the URLs on our site, even the ones in French, German, Spanish, Italian, and all the other languages. We finally got them to log into the Baidu dashboard to configure it correctly.\n\nWe also discovered that when the website had been set up years earlier, someone had put in a wildcard on the subdomain and had not limited it to just \"www\". Somehow, the Baidu crawlers were scanning every single combination of three-letter subdomains, from \"aaa\" to \"zzz\". There may have also been some numbers in there, as well, such as \"aa1\", \"aa2\"; I don't remember (I'm old, it happens).\n\nHowever, once we got Baidu configured correctly and removed the wildcard domain, everything started working again.\n\nAnd my hair had turned grayer than it had started out in the summer, and I had aged about a decade in three short months!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1672852178.0},{"title":"The Problematic Printer Photo Tray","author":"superzenki","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/103bqr0\/the_problematic_printer_photo_tray\/","text":"A few months ago a ticket came in for our university president's office printer was prompting her to load photo paper, despite her never trying to print photos or needing the option. I scheduled a time to go to her office and look at it, to see the problem. Yep, the printer itself was prompting her despite trying to print normal documents. This is one of those inkjet printers she bought with her own company card, not something we provided. But since she is the President, we do have to provide a white-glove best effort support before telling her to buy a new one. First thing I try is re-installing the driver, which is really just removing\/re-adding the printer in the settings but that doesn't fix anything. I messed with the paper tray tabs until the paper seemed to line up in there without extra space; I've seen that issue on laserjet printers that think it's trying to print a different size paper in there until that's fixed. I ran a few test prints without the message coming back, so I figured that fixed it.\n\nA little over a month later, another ticket comes in for the same issue and that there are multiple printers showing up and she wants that cleaned up. She has the same model printer at home, and this has never had the problem with asking for photo paper. So I clear out all the duplicates, and since I've already tried re-installing the driver the last time I decide to do the next logical thing: factory reset the printer entirely. I tell her I plan to do this, and she says to go ahead if that will fix it. After setting it back up and labeling it as her office printer, we do more test prints until we're sure the issue isn't coming back.\n\n[Somehow, the issue returned](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FNbLXfSXsAUvuVz?format=jpg&name=small). At this point I've already googled some to find others with the same issue on this particular model, but no resolution. I've already told my boss about the situation and she's given the okay to tell her to order a new printer if I've exhausted all of my options. I keep googling relentlessly as it's bothering me why her home printer acts fine and this one doesn't. Finally I come across a forum post of someone saying they removed the photo paper tray to solve this problem. I look up how to do it, and it doesn't look too complicated. I used to be the printer go-to guy in our department which is why I felt comfortable taking this on, so I've done my fair share of maintenance kits\/fuser replacements, and other various parts.\n\nI go back to her office, and begin the process of taking the tray out. I'm very careful as I don't want to break anything I can't fix, and I was getting some resistance along the way. This isn't like a laserjet tray you just pull out, it's kind of nested with above the main paper tray in a way that's not easy to remove permanently. Finally I get this thing, and we do more test prints. After we're not seeing the message anymore, I explain what I did and that was hopefully the solution to this problem. She applauded me taking a mechanical approach to a technical issue, and being able to find a creative solution that worked. She kept the tray in a drawer in case it's ever needed for some reason. It's been a couple months since then and I can confidently say it hasn't come back.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1672858779.0},{"title":"The Airport - Part 1","author":"PersimmonOdd3806","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10299x4\/the_airport_part_1\/","text":"Alright like many of you, I have been inspired by Mr\\_Cartographer. I am also a fellow civil servant having worked for local government entities ranging from my state, local authorities, and municipalities over my career. This is a story from when I was working at an airport. I have generalized the names to remain somewhat more anonymous. I don\u2019t give anyone permission to reuse this if that really even matters when you post something to reddit.\n\nA bit of background.\n\n1. Most of the airlines use a central company called Central Airline System\u2019s Monopoly for everything: boarding passes, marketplace, baggage, etc. When you fly and have to go up to the counter, odds are the agent is using some kind of interface that connects to the old ass mainframes hosted by Central Airline System\u2019s Monopoly. If Central Airline System\u2019s Monopoly or some part of Central Airline System\u2019s Monopoly goes down, so do the airlines. Central Airline System\u2019s Monopoly is the one ring that controls them all.\n2. Airlines use special printers and provide pectabs to the printers. Think of the pectabs basically as template files for your airline boarding passes, bag tags, etc. Central Airline System\u2019s Monopoly downloads the pectabs to these printers every time a connection is made to their systems\n3. The airport I was at is a Common Use (CU) Airport. The airport owns all of the physical hardware the airlines used. That includes printers, servers, routers, computers, monitors, kiosks, etc. The airlines own the software and there is a vendor that kind of interfaces between the airlines and the airports to assist with issues for the Common Use System itself.\n\nSound like a clusterfuck? You have no idea. I once asked a visiting implementation engineer about how he dealt with all the bullshit that came with being entangled between the airlines and airports. He basically told me \u201cNo one has died as a result of our systems\u201d. That comment set the bar really high in my mind for that wonderful system. Kind of a gray area there assuming a pissed off passenger never annihilated an agent and I just haven\u2019t heard about it yet. Hey there is a reason why most airports have security and cops on site. It isn\u2019t just for terrorists.\n\nI worked on the CU system for years. I knew those systems better than most things and I could determine what the issue was most of the time whether it was the airport, airlines, or something in between. I still loathe that system to this day and have a ton of stories and lost time because of it.\n\nDo you remember when TSA Precheck came out? It was a big deal and I remember having to upgrade the firmware on hundreds of printers in order for the TSA Precheck pectab to work properly on the onsite printers. It took me weeks to get it done. So it went pretty smoothly except for one certain airline that could never get their TSA Precheck tickets to print. Their system would only ever print out normal boarding passes even if it was for TSA Precheck. It was a problem at my airport and a couple of other places including Heathrow (in London, UK for returning passengers). Safe to say, there were literally hundreds if not thousands of passengers that were pissed off because of this. I felt terrible for the ticketing agents and I had to answer tons of tickets for this not working with no resolution since I was powerless to fix it. It really bugged me that these folks were taking the brunt of berating from the airline's loyal customers.\n\nThis went on for close to a year. The airline was blaming the airports, common use vendors, hardware vendors, and vice versa. The main focus on fixing the problem was with the printer firmware. Well I can tell you that nothing ever amounted from that approach. The engineers for the printers were based in Europe so nothing ever really got done. Nothing was ever urgent in this particular country and I can\u2019t say I blamed them. The citizens of this country get like 2 months or more of vacation a year and they use it. This is what I learned from talking with their US support engineer. It\u2019s not an insult to Europe, it was just a reality in having to deal with certain problems related to the equipment. Nothing just got done quickly.\n\nThat approach never made much sense to me because I had pretty tight contacts with other CU airports and hardware vendors (CU was so bad to work with I reached out to others for help at times). I knew the type of printers we had were printing this airline\u2019s TSA Pre-Check stuff without an issue at other airports. I expressed this over the months to the involved party's communications about this problem and nothing ever got done about it. Some lowly network guy from the airport didn\u2019t know a thing about anything. It was always \u201cWe are waiting on the printer engineers to release new firmware.\u201d\n\nI finally took a shot in the dark and reached out to a guy I knew at Central Airline System\u2019s Monopoly that focused on a different airline to ask him if he knew anyone that worked on the problematic airline\u2019s side of things. Backchanneling is always a good skill to have. Anyway that dude asked two friends and those folks asked two friends and so on (think Wayne\u2019s World). It just so happened that so many people were on the email chain that it hit the target spot on. One developer just said \u201cOf course it doesn\u2019t work because this airline ordered a restriction for the TSA Pre-Check pectab on your airport, Heathrow, and a few other airports\u201d.\n\nI never knew or understood why this restriction was in existence, but it had to come from some high up executive\/VP type of person. I found this out and reported it to my contacts at this airline. Well come to discover the person who had sole authority to lift the restriction was on vacation for like a month and no one could get ahold of them. The person just happened to check their email one day a couple of weeks later and immediately questioned why the restriction was ever in place and to lift it immediately. Once the restriction was lifted, I went out to have the airline\u2019s ticket agents print a test boarding pass to check out at the TSA checkpoint and it passed. When I reported back to the ticketing agents, they gave me a round of applause.\n\nI have other stories from the airport I might share. This is just one of many.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1672755302.0},{"title":"A quick one","author":"superzenki","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/102fwan\/a_quick_one\/","text":"Got a call from a user today that I work with a lot, claiming she was having issues with our software that connects to our main database; this stores staff\/faculty\/student credentials, grades, and some personal information like addresses.

Here is the last story from my most-recent job.  I think that pretty much sums it up, right there.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, and a lot that comes from rumors, gossip, and other people.  However some things are relatively recent, so any inaccuracies are entirely on me.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.\n\nTL\/DR: ...comes from some other beginning's end.\n\nFor some context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional. This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale. However, for reference, all these stories take place at my job at a municipality in the American South. Here is my Dramatis Personae for this part:\n\n* **$Me**: Masterful erudite.  Also me.\n* **$GreaterIT**: IT Director. Good guy, horribly overworked, I try to do all I can to make his life a little easier.\n* **$LadyEngineer**: My direct superior.  Hired last year.  Very smart, excellent project manager, probably one of the best supervisors I've ever worked for.\n* **$BigBoss**: The boss of the division I work at.  Very chill, easy-going, but likes things to work.\n* **$TheClerk**: Clerk of the municipality.  She was awesome, became my best friend in the office.\n* **$NewCM**: New City Manager.  Hired on to assist primarily in the planning department.  Nice guy, very insightful.\n* **$AssCM**: Assistant City Manager.  Actually a very nice guy, but horribly cheap and doesn't think of technology as a core part of the enterprise.  Unfortunately the villain of many a tale.\n* **$LadyCM**: Actual City Manager.  Absolutely awesome, one of the best people I've ever worked for, but is insanely busy all the time.\n* **$Kate**: GIS Director for a different city in my state.  Awesome colleague, I knew her through some professional organizations.\n\nI think I informed you all that a few years ago, I started getting a lot of recognition for the things I was doing in GIS.  Everything started out pretty slow.  I began attending local events across my state, trying to get to know people and participate where I could.  I also put myself on a path to get accepted back into graduate school.  I'd never finished my graduate degree and I wanted to.  It took a long time, a lot of money, and a lot of effort, but eventually I got into an online program to work towards my masters.  After I'd been doing this for a little while, I reached out to my new colleagues and asked if it would be ok for me to give some presentations at their events.  Surprisingly, they were very open to this.  So I started doing so.  The first ones I gave were pretty basic, but eventually I started focusing on some of the successes I'd had with the leadership at my municipality - things like the GIS investments I'd managed to sell, illustrations on what GIS could do for the city, discussions on where costs had been saved and value generated, stuff like that.  \n\nA lot of what I talked about showcased the financial side of GIS.  Apparently, this is not a very common topic in the GIS field, though it is one that others find immensely interesting.  What I was doing started making waves - *good* waves, not bad ones.  All of a sudden, I found myself being asked to present at other events, even being approached by the organizers directly!  I started getting articles in publications, had an interview published in a book, and was even cited at conferences by other people.  Surprisingly (to me most of all), I was starting to make a name for myself in the discipline.  Granted, GIS is still a relatively tiny industry (compared to, say, IT and tech support), but what I was saying still gained some traction with a lot of people, even those that I didn't realize were listening in.  Sort of like the hype surrounding the annual baking contest at the county fair - not a world-shattering accomplishment, but an accomplishment nonetheless.  Enough to maybe get more than a participation ribbon - and possibly even knock old Madam Bodewell of her high horse for a year :D\n\nEventually, I *did* get more than a participation ribbon.  A *lot* more, in fact.  I wound up winning, well, an award.  It will remain unnamed, but it is one of the highest profile ones in the field.  I never even dreamed I'd be behind something like this - in fact, when I got the email telling me that we had won this, I actually thought it was spam!  I sent it off to our IT folks to see if it was legit.  I remember **$GreaterIT**'s response:\n\n>**$GreaterIT**: Nope, this looks clean.  Congratulations!\n\nI still wasn't convinced, so I contacted a ton of other folks in the industry to make sure that this was actually real.  Every one said it was.  Holy sh!ts, y'all!  I believe my head literally exploded at the end of that day.  Not really, but still.  I took the award to the leadership of the city - they were so proud of what we had accomplished!  **$LadyCM** even gave me a raise on the spot :)\n\nAfter that, I truly felt that I had come into my own within this discipline.  As I mentioned in previous tales, I had originally wanted to pursue an entirely different career.  That other career was Urban Planning, actually.  Yet after working in government for all these years, what I had discovered was that planning consisted of little more than coming up with a bunch of ideas that nobody pays any attention to, having virtually no ability to implement, build, or create anything, and then getting yelled at by *LITERALLY EVERY PERSON INVOLVED*.  ***Fsck that***.  With GIS, I could create grand architectures and see them filled with data, I could craft apps and dashboards that were awesome, I could create maps that were genuinely beautiful, and I could see the smiles on other's faces as I introduced them to the possibilities offered by this magic we call \"*technology*.\"  So with everything that had happened over the past year, I realized that I didn't *want* to be a planner.  I liked GIS and I felt that I was good at it.  All of this had awakened a passion for this field.  That fire would not easily be put out.\n\nAnd so, I wanted to see GIS move forward here at the municipality.\n\nI got started devising a plan for how I would like to see GIS develop further at the city.  For the most part, I had managed to centralize all the GIS-related tasks under my existing position.  However, I wanted to formalize that relationship.  After all, probably 75% of my current responsibilities weren't in my original job description.  And I didn't want to be the \"GIS guy\" for the city anymore.  How many of you have had your \"responsibility creep\" start to spin out of control as the \"IT people\"?  Pretty sure all the demands to change light bulbs and fix doors get a little tiresome.  Anyways, I didn't want to have an undefined limit of responsibility anymore - I wanted the municipality to have an official GIS Department.  And I wanted to be the *GIS Manager* of that department :)\n\nAs the fiscal year came to a close, I began putting together everything to make my pitch.  I went to speak to the HR Director (who I was pretty good friends with) and asked her if I could get a copy of my original job description (so I could modify it into a GIS Manager role).  I also put together some concepts for what I'd like to see in a GIS Department for the city.  But my main task throughout all this was researching an appropriate salary for this new position.  I looked at other similar positions across the state and researched hiring bands for similar jobs I'd seen in the private sector.  I was also able to get information on the salaries for other managers here at the municipality (because, y'know, public sector and all).  Eventually I settled on a pay rate that I thought was fair.  It was about 10% less than what most of the other managers at the city in similar roles were making, but still was within the average of similar positions across the state.  But for me, it was about a 20-25% raise!  Just to say, I wanted anything that I pitched to be fair and reasonable.  After all, even though I wanted to advance myself, the city had been good to me and I wanted to keep working there.\n\nLiterally the first day of the new fiscal year, I went to speak to **$BigBoss** about all this.  I told him that I wanted to move GIS and my position forward here at the municipality.  He was very receptive to what I was saying.  Though he was also extremely busy, we scheduled a time to talk about it later.  I also sent him all the documents that I'd put together.  And then I waited, as you do.  After the inevitable cancellations and postponements and wedding showers and all of it, I finally got a chance to sit down at the table with everybody about three months later.\n\nAt that discussion, we had **$Me**, **$BigBoss**, and **$LadyEngineer** (who had just been hired).  I laid out directly what I was asking for - a new department and a promotion.  They seemed very enthusiastic - well, at least, as enthusiastic as you could be in the situation.  Can I get a show of hands of who gets excited to see Excel charts and PowerPoint slides?  Me neither.  Anyways, after making my case, they told me that what I had seemed very reasonable.  However, there was a process to follow.  I let them know that I figured it'd take until the next fiscal year (which, if you'll remember, was almost a year away).  Tacitly, I was letting them know that I was willing to wait a long time.  They seemed very appreciative of this.  The next step for me was to speak with the operational management of the city - which, in my case, meant I'd have to get things through **$AssCM**. \\*internal groan\\*\n\nI was a little hesitant about that, as you can imagine.  After all, I was well acquainted with all the issues that **$GreaterIT** had encountered when dealing with **$AssCM**.  However, *my* problems were not **$GreaterIT**'s problems.  I felt like I could at least make a decent pitch.  A few months later, we engineered a meeting with **$AssCM**.  I brought up everything that I wanted to do and submitted my request.  **$AssCM** actually seemed very interested!  He took my presentation materials and set them next to his computer, an explicit acknowledgement to me that he would genuinely review my proposal!  He told me that there might be some issues in getting an entirely new department stood up here, but a promotion sounded like a very real possibility.  *Having one of the city managers say that to me was one of the most amazing things I'd ever heard*.  I left that meeting on cloud nine.  Woohoo!!\n\nFrom here, I then intended to leave well enough alone.  I had gotten the wheels turning; it was now time to let them keep rolling until we either broke the land speed record or crashed into a tree.\n\nBut the odd thing about life is that it rarely abides by your timetable.  Even though I was content to wait almost a whole year for a decision, that wouldn't prevent people from trying to get into contact with me.  As soon as I started getting all that recognition in the industry, I began to have recruiters coming out of the woodwork with offers.  The first were of the standard idiocy you see flung about on LinkedIn:\n\n>**$Recruiter**: We have an exciting new opportunity for you with a 12-month contract that *might* turn into a full time job with no benefits and less pay!  \n>  \n>**$Me**: Awesome!  I have an exciting new opportunity for you to gaze lovingly upon my middle finger, and sit and spin!\n\nYet as the months passed, these contacts gradually became much more serious.  I wound up having at least one major job offer tossed my way each month or so.  I considered a \"major\" offer to be one that either payed me more than I was currently making, or that offered me a supervisory position (or both).   \nIt was crazy!\n\nOne company very nearly stole me away.  Just after I'd given my pitch to **$BigBoss** and **$LadyEngineer**, the VP of an extremely prominent GIS firm contacted me and offered me a job *on the spot*.  The position hadn't even been posted up online yet!  I was blown away.  I'd get to travel throughout the Southeast and work from home when I wasn't out in the field.  The VP wasn't completely committal on the pay, but it looked like this could be upwards of six figures!  I told him that I needed to think about it and asked for some time.  I then spoke to a ton of my family and friends about it.  I called a colleague of mine named **$Kate** and asked her - she said for me to do what I felt was best, but that the job sounded like a great opportunity.  I also spoke to some of my friends at the city who I trusted very much, particularly **$TheClerk**.  **$TheClerk** also recommended that I do what I thought was best, though she did warn me about some of the aspects of having a traveling job.  She was always my sounding rod at the municipality, so I took her opinion very seriously.\n\nUltimately, I decided not to take this opportunity.  I was still going through graduate school, it was a private sector job where my state benefits wouldn't carry over, and numerous other things didn't line up right.  Moreover, I really was banking on getting this promotion at the city.  As such, I called the VP that Friday and declined the job.  He understood.  \n\nI then waved goodbye to highest-paying position that had ever considered me.  No, I'm not a fool.  Stop saying that.  \\*plugs ears\\* *lalalalalala...*\n\nI stayed the course for a while after that.  I was still waiting for some sort of decision or direction from the higher ups, but nothing came.  In the meantime, I managed to finish my masters degree.  I was *immensely* proud of that, so I asked **$LadyEngineer** if I could have some time off to head up to the commencement ceremony (since it was an online program and I never actually been to the campus!)  She was ok with that.  During that same discussion, I queried if she'd heard anything about the things I'd pitched several months before.  She shook her head, saying that they hadn't come to a decision.  She did say that it looked like they were willing to give me a promotion sometime soon, but setting up a new department would take some time and would probably be spread out over a couple of years.  I shrugged my shoulders and told her I understood.  I also thanked her for being honest with me - that was one of the many things I liked about **$LadyEngineer**.\n\nOnly a day or so later, I got a call out of the blue from **$Kate**.  It went like this:\n\n>**$Kate**: Hey $Me!  Hope things are going well for you up at <municipality>!  \n>  \n>**$Me**: Hey $Kate!  Sure, things seem to be going good.  What's up?  \n>  \n>**$Kate**: Hey, I heard about this new GIS job posted at the $Facility and I think you would be a great fit for it!  \n>  \n>**$Me**: Huh... well, honestly $Kate, I'm pushing for a promotion here and I'm not really looking to move.  \n>  \n>**$Kate**: Well I already told them about you.  You should at least put in an application.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: (laughing) Are you serious, $Kate?  That sounds like you.  \n>  \n>**$Kate**: (snickering) Yep!\n\nI then looked up this job that **$Kate** had voluntold me to apply for.  It was at a place that I'll call the **$Facility**.  I'll keep the details vague, but suffice to say that this was one of the highest-profile industrial concerns in my *entire state*.  They were looking for a GIS Director to construct an architecture from the ground up - y'know, *exactly the same type of thing that I had already done at the municipality*.  Without question, I felt that I had every requirement they were asking for in the job description.  \n\nHowever, it was in a city that was about a two hour's drive away from where I was currently living.  Taking a position there would mean moving.  The city I'd be moving to was also one of the most expensive in the state, so I'd have to make sure that I was getting adequately compensated.  The base pay being offered was already a massive increase from what I was making, but I resolved to make sure to ask for more if they brought me in for an interview.  What did I have to lose?  If you're going to go, go all out.  So I filled out an application and submitted it.\n\nI wound up bringing this up to **$TheClerk** over lunch one day.  She asked me about the job and I told her as much as I knew.  She said that if I kept getting pitches like this, eventually someone was going to steal me away.  I laughed and responded that it was all really hinging on the decision for my promotion.  If the city was willing to give me what I was asking for, I would feel like they genuinely valued me.  And I liked working for the municipality anyways.  Someone would have to give me a really huge offer to steal me away after that.  **$TheClerk** said she understood.  After we got done talking, though, she looked a little down.  I asked her why - she laughed that all her friends at the city eventually found something new and left.  I gave her a hug and told her that even if I did leave, I'd still keep in touch.  And I meant it.\n\nA few more months passed.  I got ready to head up to the Midwest for my graduation ceremony.  The **$Facility** wasn't weighing very heavily on my mind - I was much more concerned with the immense amount of work I still had at the municipality as well as my preparations for the trip.  All of a sudden, one week before I was due to leave, I got an email from HR at the **$Facility**:\n\n>**$HR**: Hello $Me!  We would like to bring you in for an interview for the GIS Director position at the $Facility.  Please indicate a time you are available within <the week after next> to meet with us.  Thank you!\n\n...**wut**?!?  Holy crap!  *I'd gotten an interview*!  Unfortunately, the only day I had available during the indicated week was my first day back after driving something like 800 miles.  I would need quite the necromancy - or caffeine - to be able to make it.  Pretty sure they're the same thing.  But nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?  I contacted the HR folks back and told them that I'd show up for the interview on the date in question.  The missiles were in the air!\n\nThe night before the interview, we rolled back into town around midnight.  Again, I had driven back to the Deep South from the Midwest in a single day.  We'd left at like 9 AM that morning.  I don't think the term \"*exhausted*\" does it justice.  Yet when I laid down to get some sleep, I found that I couldn't rest at all!  My mind was racing.  Seriously, I might have slept 30 minutes that whole night!  It wasn't nervousness about the interview - I've found that I'm pretty decent at presenting myself.  That... does not sound like the best choice of words.  Anyways, I couldn't get it out of my head.  I guess it was really what this job would mean for me and my family - new city, new career, new home, new everything.  It was a lot to contemplate.\n\nI had to be to the **$Facility** at 8:00 AM (and it was a 2-hour drive through hellacious morning-commute traffic), so I left the house at 5:00 AM to get there.  Along the way, I was chugging Coke Zeroes and pushing myself back in my seat just to stay awake.  Probably not the smartest thing I've ever done.   \nEventually, I made it to the **$Facility**'s headquarters building.  I was immensely nervous as I headed in; I remember looking at wrinkles on my shirt and some of the worn hems along the ankles of my pants and thinking that I looked a mess.  I didn't think I'd make a good impression in the interview.\n\nAs soon as I got in, the security guard whisked me off to a side conference room.  He told me that the Vice President of Engineering would be down to see me shortly.  I'm sure my eyes bulged at the mention of the person who'd be interviewing me.  I had a small manila folder of some sample GIS reports and documentation that I could use as examples, so I started going through them on the conference table.  About twenty minutes later, a sharply-dressed gentleman walked into the conference room.  He apologized to me, saying that he'd had to put out some sort of fire with the CEO and had been delayed.  I don't know if he saw, but I did a nervous swallow once I heard that - this was the big leagues here, no doubt.\n\nWe then did the interview.  He brought up all the things that they wanted to do with GIS at the **$Facility**.  Periodically, I'd show him a report that would illustrate something very close to the point he was talking about, or I would pull up an app on my phone and showcase a concept that was like something he'd mentioned.  I also found that he'd come from a public utilities background - this was great for me as I had been working in that field now for about five years.  Many of my examples were things he understood well.  \n\nOne thing I did point out was that this new city was significantly more expensive than where I was from.  As such, I wanted a higher rate of pay than the advertised minimum.  I asked for what I thought was a *stupid* amount of money - the rate was within the range for the job, just in the upper part of that range.  He seemed to take it in stride.  Anyways, we got done with the interview, I shook his hand, and then I left to head back home.  His expressions had been hard to read.  While I felt that I'd presented my material well, I didn't feel like I'd made a good impression.  Ultimately, I didn't think that I would be as good a candidate as someone else that had been more \"flashy\" or someone who hadn't asked for as much money.  Oh well.  You win some, you lose some.  At least I'd have a story to tell :)\n\nThe next day when I got into work, **$LadyEngineer** met me and asked me to come speak to her in her office.  I headed over; she was smiling and had a manila envelope on her desk.  It was my promotion!  Hooray! :D  As she gave the paperwork to me, however, she had a sort of apologetic expression on her face.  She said that while everyone had agreed on the job description I had put together, they hadn't agreed about the pay.  They had still given me a raise but it was less than half of what I had asked for.  **$LadyEngineer** told me that she had pushed very hard for the pay that I had requested, but in the end it was turned down.  I looked at the documents she had; my feelings were a little all over the place.  On the one hand, it had gotten the promotion I'd asked for and I had gotten a raise!  But it wasn't the pay that I had asked for.  I didn't want to seem entitled, but I thought that I'd requested something that was very fair to all involved.  I'd even turned down a huge job offer on the hope that my request here would have been met!  Still, I went ahead and signed it, telling **$LadyEngineer** that I would try to do the best job I could do.  She gave me a hug.\n\nLater on, I spoke to **$TheClerk** about it all.  To make y'all aware, **$TheClerk** is the Grey Eminence.  She knows literally *everything* behind the scenes at the city.  She knows all the dirty laundry and knows where *every one* of the bodies is buried.  Anyways, I told her that I'd gotten the promotion I wanted, but that I hadn't gotten the pay I'd asked for.  I was pretty down about that.  She then confided in me that she'd spoken to a number of folks about all this.  Turns out, **$LadyEngineer**, **$BigBoss**, and even the HR Director had advocated for me getting the pay rate I'd asked for!  Each one of them thought I was worth it.  They'd recommended this to the city manager in charge of everything - who was, in this case, **$AssCM**.  *Fsck*.  At the very last minute (literally the day before the promotion was given to me), **$AssCM** cut my raise in half.  The reason?  *He didn't feel that I should be making more money than the other managers here at the city who were actually in charge of people*.  \n\nWhat. The. Fsck, dude?!?  *That's* your reason?  Most of what I do is not managing people and never would be - it's administering an enterprise!  I would wager the DBAs out there would have some... *words*... if some pompous idiot showed up and said they weren't worth their pay because they \"weren't managing enough people.\"  I'd needed immense amounts of experience to be able to accomplish all this!  I had to have multiple degrees!  Basically, what **$TheClerk** was telling me was that **$AssCM** did not recognize that the technical talents I brought to the table were worth more than me being able to manage people.  Christ, it was so... *disheartening*.  And it wasn't like technical skill hadn't been a component of other employees' salaries.  **$GreaterIT** was making even more than what I was asking for, yet he had no employees at the time either.  I told **$TheClerk** that I'd specifically turned down other jobs because I was banking on getting the pay rate I wanted from here - *and now that was all for naught*.  I was very upset.  In many ways, I'd put myself in this place, naively trusting that this would work out the way I had planned.  It didn't make things hurt any less.\n\nFor the next two weeks, I wasn't as... *enthusiastic*, I suppose, as I could have been.  While I did change my email signature and LinkedIn status and all, I didn't bring any attention to the fact that I'd gotten a promotion.  Honestly, I was waiting to see if the **$Facility** would call me back.  If you'll recall, on my previous job hunting adventures, I'd had people contact me within a week with offers.  I guess I was spoiled from that.  However, after about two weeks had passed, I resigned myself that I probably wasn't getting the job at the **$Facility**.  Instead, I had gotten a promotion here at the municipality; it was time to own up to it and start pushing forward with what I wanted to do.  Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, as my grandma would say.  I started picking myself back up at work.  I ordered new business cards.  I started introducing myself with my new title at some of the local events.  Even if it wasn't everything I had wanted, it was still *something*.  And I resolved myself to try and make the best of it :)\n\nA month later, I was writing up my morning notes when I saw something pop up on my personal email on my phone.  Yep, you guessed it.  It was from the HR department at the **$Facility**:\n\n>Dear **$Me**;  \n>  \n>I am pleased to offer you the position of GIS Director here at the **$Facility**!  Your starting salary will be <stupid amount of money, exactly what I'd asked for>.  In addition, we will provide you with a moving stipend to help ease the transition to <new city>.  Your first day will be <day about a month and a half later>.  Please contact me by this Friday with your decision.  We look forward to seeing you hear at the **$Facility**!  \n>  \n>\\- **$Facility HR Team**\n\nY'all... I leaned back in my chair and just looked at this email for a while.  What they had offered to me was *TWICE* my annual salary.  I would be a director.  I would be able to build the *entire GIS infrastructure* for the biggest industrial concern in my state.  After a while, I couldn't help but start grinning like an idiot.\n\nIt took me about an hour to get over my initial shock.  I then called my wife and told her what had happened.  She made lots of squeaky noises.  I printed the offer letter.  I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do at that moment, but I felt like I needed to at least talk about this with my immediate boss, **$LadyEngineer**.  I had come to genuinely trust and respect her.  I wanted to know what she thought.\n\nI went to her office and asked to speak to her for a few minutes.  I shut the door behind me as I did so.  Wordlessly, I put the offer letter on her desk.  She read it; after a few minutes, she looked back to me with a sad smile.  I'm sure I looked sort of nervous in return.  I told her that I had not reached out for this, someone had recommended me.  And I had not made a decision yet.  But I would have to make one soon.  She understood.  She asked me if I would be willing to speak with one of the city managers about it - we'd just hired a new one, **$NewCM**, and she wanted me to talk to him.  I said sure.  I also talked to her about what I'd heard from **$TheClerk** surrounding my promotion; she confirmed everything that had been said to me.  I just shook my head.  But I thanked her for being honest with me, and for being willing to stand up for me.  And I told her that she was probably the best boss I've ever had.\n\nThat night, I spoke to about a dozen of my friends and family members.  Every single one of them recommended that I take the new job.\n\nThe next day, I came in to speak to **$NewCM** first thing in the morning.  I didn't really know what he would try to say to me.  Would he try to make me a counter-offer?  Would he try to dissuade me at all, or simply say goodbye?  I didn't have a good read of him, to be honest - he had only been there a few days at that point.  I went into the meeting uncertain of what to expect.  But once we got to talking, **$NewCM**'s attitude was very friendly and forthcoming.  He said to me that he wasn't trying to talk me into or out of anything.  He just wanted to hear what I had to say.  He asked me what I enjoyed about the job here at the municipality, and so I told him.  He then asked me what I would be doing at the new job, and I went into all the things I could do there.  The opportunity it presented to me, the new vistas and challenges it offered.  I know I was excited when I spoke of it.  At the end, **$NewCM** smiled and said the following:\n\n>**$NewCM**: By the way your face lit up when you talked about the new job, I think you have already made your decision.\n\n*Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end.*\n\nAfter he said that, I... started to tear up.  I think it was at moment that I finally knew that I would be leaving.  And truth be told, I didn't *want* to leave.  The city had been good to me.  I had made so many lifelong friends here.  But I also knew that an opportunity like this would rarely come again.  We all have to take leaps in our lives, whether we feel comfortable about them or not.  I wanted to be the best GIS professional I could be, to reach the pinnacle of my career.  This job could take me there.  It didn't make the sadness go away, however.  Like when you leave all your friends after graduation.  You know from the moment you step through those doors that it will have to end someday, yet when that day comes, it still comes all too soon.\n\nI took a moment to compose myself and thanked **$NewCM** for speaking to me.  My mind was made up.  I would be leaving the municipality and joining the **$Facility**.  I told my wife that night; she was fully behind me.\n\nThe next morning, when I got into work, I started typing up my letter of resignation.  A few minutes after I started, one of the sewer managers, a super gruff, blunt, to-the-point guy that I'll call **$Gruff** came into my office.  Our conversation went like this:\n\n>**$Gruff**: Hey $Me, I got a couple more sewer lines we need to GPS out in... hey, are you ok?  \n>  \n>**$Me**: (smiling weakly) Yeah, I'm fine.  \n>  \n>**$Gruff**: You don't look fine.  What's up?  \n>  \n>**$Me**: I'm resigning, man.  Sorry.  \n>  \n>**$Gruff**: You're fscking with me.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: Nope.  I'm typing up my letter of resignation right now.\n\nAt that, **$Gruff** *hung his head*.  I'd never seen any kind of emotion in him, ever.  It was actually kind of touching.  Like an Orc petting a kitten.  I told him that I would do my best to work through my notice and I wouldn't leave them in the lurch.  He nodded and thanked me for helping them out all these years.\n\nI then took my letter to **$LadyEngineer** and **$BigBoss**.  Both of them knew.  It wasn't a surprise.  We talked for about an hour, all kinds of things - what I'd be able to do at the new job, reminiscing about old times, stuff still left to do, hilarious stories of horrible contractors, that sort of thing.  In the end, I thanked them for everything and I gave them both hugs.  I told them that they had made my job here the most fulfilling I had ever had in my entire life.  I then went through city hall and told most of the rest of my friends and coworkers, including **$LadyCM** and **$NewCM**.  I didn't bother to tell **$AssCM**, though.  He was the reason I was leaving.  He could find out from someone else.\n\nAfter that, I got everything in order.  The **$Facility** had given me a month and a half before I'd need to start the new job, so I told the city that I'd work out almost a six week notice (seriously, I only took one day off between the old job and the new one).  There was so much that I still had left to do, and I resolved to try and take care of as much of it as I could.  *And d@mned if I did*!  I pushed out data updating products, a major internal webmap service, wrapped up two major projects that had been in the works for years.  I even managed to go through all of the utility customers' accounts and associate City, State, and ZIP fields for each address (something $StupidWorks had never been able to do, the idiots).  I didn't slack *at all*.  I even worked extra hours each night and came in on those few remaining weekends!  Just before I left, I rolled out a highly-successful story map and even presented it to the City Council during one of their meetings.  I intended to leave this position on a high note - *and I feel that I absolutely did* :)\n\nThere was a lot else, too, folks.  I had managed to accomplish so much here.  I meant it when I said this had been the most fulfilling job I'd ever had.  And I had started working for the municipality when my little girl was only 8 months old.  She was 5 now.  All she had ever known was that the municipality was \"*Daddy's Job*.\"  So many memories will be cherished from there.  **$GreaterIT** managed to surreptitiously flip me off every time he saw me before I left, with a little bastardly smile each time he did so :)  We had a nice going-away party for me, and I threw a party for my crews in the utilities department to thank them for the hard work and acceptance they'd shown me over these past many years.  \n\nMy last day was a Thursday.  I brought my little girl with me, just as I'd done at my last job.  I turned in the keys to my city vehicle.  I took all the pictures down in my office, deleted everything off my workstation, and put all my personal effects in my car.  I let my daughter go around city hall and say goodbye to everyone.  The last person she spoke to was **$TheClerk**.  My little girl gave her a big hug and told her that she loved her.  As we drove at the end of that day, we both waved goodbye to the city one final time.\n\nFour days later, I pulled into the staff parking lot of the **$Facility**.  I took a deep breath as I got out of my car.  The smell of salt was strong in the air, with the sound of gulls calling and light flickering off the ocean in front of me.  I could not contain my smile.  I remember hesitating at the entrance for a moment, but just a moment - and then I opened those doors to the next chapter in this wonderful, crazy thing we call life.\n\n:D\n\nAnd that, my friends, is that.  Thus ended my time at the municipality.  Thank you for reading, everybody, and I hope you all have enjoyed these stories.  I'm certain I will have more from the **$Facility** before long.  So until then, Happy New Years, and *don't forget to turn it off and on again* :)\n\nHere are my other stories on TFTS, if you're interested:\n\n* **The Municipality Series**: [Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zvn6e9\/the_municipality_part_1_the_plotter\/) [Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zwwnwe\/the_municipality_part_2_the_database\/) [Part 3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zxt8di\/the_municipality_part_3_trois_nouvelles_nouvelles\/) [Part 4](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zz8dfw\/the_municipality_part_4_the_second_corner_of_the\/) [Part 5](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/10038rk\/the_municipality_part_5_tales_of_thatguy\/) [Part 6](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/100vvko\/the_municipality_part_6_tales_from_greaterit\/)\n* **The Agency Series**: [Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/sh5m55\/the_agency_part_1_the_chaos_begins\/) [Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/si0d1y\/the_agency_part_2_the_reign_of_badmike\/) [Part 3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/sivnc3\/the_agency_part_3_the_lawyer\/) [Part 4](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/sjs025\/the_agency_part_4_an_avalanche_of_accountability\/) [Part 5](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/sknt9k\/the_agency_part_5_dont_let_the_door_hit_you\/) [Part 6](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/sljw99\/the_agency_part_6_the_ballad_of_the_bosses\/) [Part 7](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/smeb69\/the_agency_part_7_farewell_adieu_auf_wiedersehen\/) [Part 8](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/sna2uh\/the_agency_part_8_epilogue\/)\n* **A Symphony of Fail** [Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/rmasuq\/a_symphony_of_fail_part_1\/) [Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/rnmk82\/a_symphony_of_fail_part_2\/) [Part 3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/robtwl\/a_symphony_of_fail_part_3_finale\/)","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1672711823.0},{"title":"Growing the Infrastructure,","author":"ascii4ever","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/101kfwo\/growing_the_infrastructure\/","text":"I am inspired again by Mr\\_Cartographers tales of a public agency being dragged kicking and screaming into the modern IT world.\n\nMy experience was somewhat similar when I arrived at my new University sysadmin job in the summer of 2000.  The fellow who hired me had been having a terrible time filling the position, so he was really glad I was coming on board, and I, being recently laid off, was really glad *to be* coming on board.\n\nAnyway, my boss, **$J**, was very smart, very organized, but kind of young (late twenties), and a very good boss.  He was a wiz at technical stuff, but didn't have a lot of experience with things like budgets, and I'm not sure he had had to do much long range planning.  I was older and I had fair amount of management experience, but I was brand new to this shop so I had a pretty good learning curve ahead of me.\n\n**$J** had built a fantastic Linux shop.  He had created his own desktop imaging system which was really cool.  Boot a desktop off a floppy (yes, in 2000 we still did this), answer prompts about hostname, IP, GW, netmask, and walk away.  All machines, servers and desktops, used open source management software with everything from packages needed to configuration files handled.  Need a new DNS server?  Take machine X, add it to the \"DNS server\" class, Bob's your uncle.\n\nHe'd written a ton of documentation covering every aspect of the network, services, and desktop environment.   Documentation and automation was all managed with a version control system.  There were two backup systems, one to cover a fancy file server and another all the Linux servers.   It was very impressive and it ran super smoothly.\n\nDue to all the automation there was lots of time for us to work on more interesting stuff, very little firefighting.  If a server died, we grabbed a spare machine (usually some old desktop), re-imaged it, let the automation system transform it into what we needed, and that was that.\n\nWhat became clear after I had been there for a short time, was that **$J**  was planning on leaving.  He really wanted to move into a research role at a nearby institution.  He had hired me with the idea that I would take over from him, which was okay with me since if I did this I would be looking at a nice salary increase.\n\nOne of the things that **$J** had managed to do was implement a fairly complex group of services on a pretty tight budget.  Our server room had a total of **two** racks.  One was for patch panels with network switches shoehorned in, and the other held our fancy file server, plus a modem rack.  Again, this is 2000, we ran a PPP server since home broadband was pretty uncommon at this point.  The rest of room (it was kind of long and skinny), had tables running down both long walls.  Old desktop machines were clustered along the tables (or under the tables), with desktop UPS units, monitors, mice, and keyboards, with an occasional KVM switch here or there.  Not every \"server\" had a keyboard\/monitor connection, sometimes we were unplugging from one server then plugging into another.\n\nOur network switches were a collection of different un-managed switches, one of which was 10BaseT, all connected to ancient 4U switch (which either 4 or 6 interfaces), which handled the uplink to our main campus network.  Which was 10Mbps.  There were a couple of media converters in the mix, I don't remember why.\n\n**$J** and I discussed how things worked, how did stuff get upgraded, and \"what is our budget?\".  **$J** just looked at me and said, \"We don't have one\".  Further discussion revealed when he needed something, he went to his boss, who went to the big boss, who grumbled and hand waved, and eventually someone asked the department accountant if we had any money, and after a lot of discussion and soul searching, some money *might* be forthcoming.\n\nOkay, we had between 400 and 500 users of various intensity at this time.  Almost twenty tenured faculty, all doing research, graduates students, undergraduates, the department staff (who relied on an NT domain we supported), plus various collaborators both on and off campus.  I was kind of shocked by all this, it seemed like an accident waiting to happen.  **$J** agreed, but the faculty, in general, did not want to spend money on infrastructure.  They wanted new laptops, or desktop machines for their Research Assistants, or some other shiny, new toy.  Not boring stuff that was hidden away in the \"server room\".  BTW, the server room had no fire suppression system or line conditioning, and the HVAC unit was installed so it shared the plenum return with the main building HVAC system.\n\n**$J** was a victim of his own success.  He had designed and built a system out of used desktop hardware and open source software, and it worked really well.  But it had NO defense in depth.   And no one wanted to give us more money since everything was working fine, right?  We'll talk about it next fiscal year.  The other factor, I think, was **$J**'s age.  He wasn't thirty yet and most of faculty considered him kind of an older student.  I occasionally overheard snarky comments from professors regarding **$J**, which was upsetting.  These folks didn't realize what an outstanding job he had done, mostly on his own, that provided them a highly adaptable, if somewhat fragile, toolbox.\n\nAnd finally **$J** got a job offer from the other institution, and the entire beautiful house of cards was now mine.\n\nOne of the first things I did was meet with our Department Administrator (**$DA**).   **$DA** was one of the most organized and generally awesome people I ever worked with.   She a million things to deal with but she was always super helpful to me.  Anyway, I met with her and laid out my concerns and suggested we plan for some hardware replacement on an ongoing basis.  She explained we didn't really have a line item in our budget for this, however, there was another idea.\n\n**$DA**  \"Could you use the student money?\"\n\n**$Me** \"What is the student money?  I've never heard of it\"\n\n**$DA**  \"Every course we teach has an extra charge added on over and above tuition\"\n\n**$Me** (confused) \"Why is that?\"\n\n**$DA**  \"Most of the Engineering courses have this.  Its to cover stuff like lab supplies and equipment.  Or special software that needs to be purchased or licensed.\"\n\n**$Me** \"So, computers, printers, paper?\"\n\n**$DA** \"As long as its for students\"\n\n**$Me** \"How much money do we have?\"\n\n**$DA**  \"Hum, actually we haven't been spending it recently, let me check\"  <logs into University ERP system, or what passed for one in those days>  \"Oh, there's $150,000\".\n\nI about fell out of my chair at this point.  We were just sitting on this money?  If I was a student I'd be up in arms, if I'm paying money for \"technology\", how's about you spend it on technology?\n\nIt turned out there were a couple of other possible sources of money.  The University would sometimes kick back money it skimmed from research grants (overhead) to the various Deans of the various schools and colleges.  And the Deans would generally kick that back to the various departments.  Our department also had been awarded a large grant for improving infrastructure a couple of years ago.  I had not heard of this.  Apparently the big boss, **$BB**, liked being able to brag about this grant so he refused to spend any of it!  Every year he asked the agency that had provided the grant for an extension, and so far they had approved an extension.  This was crazy.  Infrastructure was exactly our weakest link and we actually had a pile of money we WERE NOT touching.\n\nI emailed my boss to request a meeting.  He was super busy but we got together, I made my pitch about our fragile set up.  He agreed and basically said, \"put together a plan, get input from **$DA**, and our accountant, he'd take it to **$BB**.\n\nOver the next few weeks I was able to figure out what we actually spent on various stuff, what funding we generally received, and put together a proposal that we sequester certain amounts from various accounts and transfer this into a NEW account that was for upgrades\/replacements\/improvements.\n\nIt took a while to sell it to **$BB**, but he eventually gave in and I had my funding.\n\nI had already done an evaluation of our \"servers\", figuring out which ones were for the high jump.  I also decided we were going to switch from using desktop machines for servers and use rack mount machines.  We had limited floor space and the number of machines I was expected to host in the server room was growing monthly as faculty purchased research systems that needed to live somewhere.  So I bought a couple of racks, had my student employees clear one of the tables off by moving the various desktops to other temporary locations, and bought some nice rack mount boxes to replace them.  I bought a rack mount UPS as well and finally retired one group of tired old machines.\n\nThen I bought another rack, had my students clear another table, bought some more RM servers, and so on.  We just snowballed things from there.  And then **$DA** informed me that the agency that provided the infrastructure grant had refused **$BB**'s request for another extension.  We had a year to spend it, I think we had several hundred thousand more dollars suddenly.  **$BB** kind of \"pork barreled\" this out to some of the senior faculty, but I did get a pretty big chunk for, you know, actual infrastructure.   I think I upgraded the switch stack so that at least we had uniform hardware and we got rid of the ancient giant switch and replaced with something from the twenty first century.\n\nI couldn't do anything about the room itself.  As we added computers the heat load went up as well as the electrical load.  I had the campus electricians in to add more circuits (I had inherited a mess of power strips), and luckily the server room had its own panel with a high capacity so we could keep adding breakers.\n\nThe heat load was what finally killed my grand schemes.  We got to the point where in the summer months we could not maintain a proper working temperature.  I had to tell the faculty we couldn't host anymore machines in the server room, if they bought a \"research server\" it would have to housed in their lab space.  This wasn't addressed until we had a major crisis, recounted here:\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/ojledi\/how\\_much\\_support\\_do\\_you\\_need\\_the\\_cost\\_of\\_nines\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/ojledi\/how_much_support_do_you_need_the_cost_of_nines\/)\n\nAny, apologies if this is too long\/boring\/whatever, but time hangs heavy on a retired guy's hands.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1672685935.0},{"title":"We own what?

This has made me what I am today.\n\nIn the mid 2010's, towards the end of the company's wind down period (you may guess what Industry we were in), there was a question regarding the two class a subnets the company owned, as we owned them but weren't getting charged for them.

Anyways, long story short, the company owned more than a half million dollars worth of IP address space at the time which we weren't paying for, which was a nice chunk of change at the time, since someone registered them so early on.  It was eventually all transferred I assume to the parent companies.\n\nI hinted to management that the previous webmaster should have gotten a kickback from what they did before I joined the company, but I am certain the parent companies took all of that themselves.

Here is the next tale from the municipality.  In this one, I'll bring up some stories that I know about from my friend, $GreaterIT.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, and a lot that comes from rumors, gossip, and other people.  However some things are relatively recent, so any inaccuracies are entirely on me.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.\n\nTL\/DR: Let the King have some!\n\nFor some context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional. This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale. However, for reference, all these stories take place at my job at a municipality in the American South. Here is my Dramatis Personae for this part:\n\n* **$Me**: Masterful erudite.  Also me.\n* **$GreaterIT**: IT Director. Good guy, horribly overworked, I try to do all I can to make his life a little easier.\n* **$ElderIT**: The old IT Director.  Originally brought in as a contractor, had a pretty laissez-faire approach to the work.\n* **$AssCM**: Assistant City Manager.  Actually a very nice guy, but horribly cheap and doesn't think of technology as a core part of the enterprise.  Unfortunately the villian of many a tale.\n* **$LadyCM**: Actual City Manager.  Absolutely awesome, one of the best people I've ever worked for, but is insanely busy all the time.\n\nSo these aren't really my stories, they're stories of **$GreaterIT**.  I asked him if he was ok with me sharing some of this stuff, and he said he was.  However, if he gets on Reddit and corrects me, that would be awesome :)\n\n**$GreaterIT** wasn't always in IT.  In fact, for most of his career he actually worked for the public safety department.  And he got started a long time ago - as far as I'm aware, he's been employed here for about twenty years or more.  He's always had a decent grasp of technology, though.  And because of this, over time he was gradually drafted to help support the public safety department for most of its IT needs.  I've often wondered how he was able to type with those firefighter's gloves on for all those years...\n\nAnyways, there were a couple of reasons why he originally fell into the role he had.  The first was one I alluded to in my very first story in this series.  Not that long ago, we had very little professional IT support here at the municipality.  There was only a contractor, **$ElderIT**, working part-time to support the city's tech needs.  I don't think we even had a city-wide network until 2011.  As you can imagine, tech has been a requirement for municipal governments for far longer than that.  So in the many years before the city finally buckled down and set up a proper IT infrastructure, the public safety department had to have someone on-hand to support the technology they used for their own needs - and the person conscripted to do so was **$GreaterIT**.\n\nAnother reason was due to the attitudes of the public safety department itself.  Whenever something technical was needed, particularly by the higher ups, the answer to a request (i.e., *demand*) was not \"sure, let me triage that and fit it into the schedule.\"  Rather, it was \"get it done, get it done *now*, and don't stop working on it until it's done.\"  It was as autocratic as it sounds.  This is the way it was for many years.  And yes, it does mean that he was taken advantage of - quite a lot, unfortunately :(  But it also meant that when there were problems that the existing IT director (**$ElderIT**) couldn't or *wouldn't* handle, **$GreaterIT** could be dispatched by the public safety department to take care of the issue.\n\nThus, despite **$ElderIT** being in the position of leadership, it was actually **$GreaterIT** that wound up gaining the lion's share of expertise with the city's enterprise (particularly since he worked on so many things that **$ElderIT**, in his petulance, would refuse to address).  And once it was apparent that **$ElderIT** would be retiring soon, everyone quickly recognized that **$GreaterIT** had more familiarity with our system than literally anyone else.  He had all this despite never having any formal IT training, too.  Experience by itself is worth its weight in gold; **$GreaterIT** must have been worth his weight in palladium.  Or iridium.  Or... unobtainium.  Whatever.  Anyways, when **$ElderIT** finally did retire, it seemed fait accompli that **$GreaterIT** would get the job.  It took a few months, but eventually he became the new official IT Director.\n\nOur story today will take us through the trials and travails that **$GreaterIT** experienced once becoming director.  I've often wondered what things must have looked like through his eyes as he stepped into this position.  To me, it would have seemed overwhelming.  There had already been a tremendous amount of work to do even without him taking on this role.  And with him now at the helm of the entire city, he could finally see what was needed to right the ship - and it was immense.  Like a rowboat trying to paddle through a hurricane.\n\nOne of **$GreaterIT**'s first tasks was cleaning up the various final messes left by **$ElderIT** following his departure from the city.  As I alluded to in previous stories, **$ElderIT**'s whole attitude towards the job was incredibly cavalier.  With him knowing that he'd be retiring soon, his senioritis exploded by an order of magnitude.  **$GreaterIT** took some time to review the everything in place once he'd officially started as director, and realized he'd have to do a ton to correct things.  To be honest, I don't know most of the details surrounding all the work he did, but I do remember one example - the city's domain name.\n\nJust before **$ElderIT** left, he had worked with the city to set up a new domain name.  This necessitated changes to all of our email addresses.  The problem was, most of the segmented software packages in use across the city had credentials that were hard-coded using the *old* domain.  When we had reached out to **$ElderIT** about it, he had told us to \"just log in with the old credentials.\"  Very quickly, this started to get out of hand.  As new people came onboard, they would be set up in the new domain, but sometimes would need something created in the old domain just to allow them to access certain software suites.  I'm pretty sure there was a way to just adjust this or forward things through the Active Directory, but **$ElderIT** never set it up.  For me, some parts of my GIS software, my Adobe suite, my AutoCAD, and a few others had been hardcoded in this manner.  It was a severe pain in the a$$ and we kept discovering more authentication issues issues pretty much weekly.  So for the first year or so of his tenure, **$GreaterIT** was inundated with requests to update these credentials.  In most cases he managed to do so, though for whatever reason the creds would often get \"criss-crossed\" in certain suites (particularly **$StupidWorks**), where sometimes they would work and sometimes they wouldn't.  Ugh.  I have no idea why this would happen.  You all would know better than me.  But it was **$GreaterIT** that had to reap the fruit of this foul harvest.\n\nApparently, **$ElderIT**'s half-a$$ed approach to everything wasn't just something that I commiserated with.  **$GreaterIT** told me a relevant story a few years later.  Just before I was hired, the municipality had contracted with a well-known local MSP to plug the gaps where our existing IT efforts weren't up to spec (in a manner similar to plugging holes in a dam with your fingers).  Anyways, the MSP came onsite to do some sort of review, took a look at **$ElderIT**'s efforts, and immediately recognized just how lousy they were.  Upon seeing this, however, they immediately viewed it not as a deficiency but as an *opportunity*, and went into scheme mode \\**cue piano music and evil twin mustaches*.\\*  They spoke to **$GreaterIT**, offering to hire him full time at the MSP.  They would then recommend the city council outsource its IT services to the MSP, eliminating **$ElderIT** and his position in the process (using his sh!tty work as the justification), and would set up **$GreaterIT** as their on-site rep.  Once **$ElderIT** was out of the picture, the MSP could gradually ramp up the fees to the city once they became dependent upon the MSP's services.  **$GreaterIT** thought this was *shady AF* and told them no.  But it goes to show you all how poorly **$ElderIT**'s efforts were viewed by other IT professionals.\n\nCleaning up **$ElderIT**'s filthy leavings wasn't all that **$GreaterIT** had to deal with, of course.  Another major thing that he had to address was the plethora of archaic hardware infesting every corner of the city.  Prior to around 2010 or so, basically everything technological was an afterthought at the city.  Things were cobbled together from whatever hardware could be provisioned at the time.  Even after the city had managed to develop a working IT infrastructure, it remained immensely difficult for new investments to be made.  After all, once something is paid for and is put in place, it will keep working forever, right? \\*facepalm\\*\n\nI remember going to the \"IT Room\" about two years ago to talk to **$GreaterIT**.  The \"IT Room\" was, btw, a large closet on the back side of one of the buildings at city hall that served as a combination hardware storage room, server room, and IT office.  There was barely enough space to move in there.  At this particular visit, **$GreaterIT** told me that he'd finally managed to pull some strings to get an antique switch in the IT Room replaced.  I don't remember the model number or anything, but I was told it was from 2002.  I asked him about it:\n\n>**$Me**: So where are you getting the new switch from?  \n>  \n>**$GreaterIT**: One of the county's departments just replaced some of their equipment.  They are getting rid of the old hardware.  Their switches still work and they're newer!  \n>  \n>**$Me**: Sounds good.  You said this one was from 2002.  How much newer is the replacement?  \n>  \n>**$GreaterIT**: 2004.\n\nLOL.  Remember, this was in 2020.  Nothing better than getting excited over replacing an 18-year-old switch with a 16-year-old one :D\n\nOf course, this kind of thing wasn't the only type of hardware that kept going out on **$GreaterIT**.  He was on-hand to work on, basically, any type of device in use by any department across the city.  This included radios, dash cams, and body cams - all things heavily used by the public safety department.  The problem was that once these any of this equipment was purchased, there was never any money budgeted to pay for maintenance of the equipment over time.  Nor was there any forethought that these things would eventually need to be replaced, either.  As a result, **$GreaterIT** found himself trying cobbling things together into zombie monstrosities just to get a a basic functionality.  I know that after a few years of being on the job, **$GreaterIT** was routinely taking every single bodycam owned by the city and ripping out working parts to assemble together just enough operational cameras for the officers on duty at that time!  It was awful.  It was unsustainable.  And eventually, **$GreaterIT** would call the city out on it.  More on that later.\n\nPart of the problem in all this was **$AssCM**.  **$AssCM** was the assistant city manager and was in charge of operations, but he had originally come from the public safety department.  He very much ascribed to the same thinking that the rest of them had towards IT - namely, that it wasn't a core part of what they did and that it didn't deserve all the investment that **$GreaterIT** continually asked for.  I remember one situation very specifically.  About two years ago, **$GreaterIT** requested that we purchase a new server for the main part of city hall, as the one that was in place was getting very old and unreliable.  **$GreaterIT** indicated that it could go out on us at any moment if we didn't do something to shore it up.  **$AssCM**'s response was, bluntly, that the existing system was working and it was not a priority to be replaced.  *NOT EVEN A MONTH* after the municipal budget was passed, this server died.  No one at city hall could do any work and we had to pay a premium price to get a new server shipped to us as fast as possible.  **$AssCM** had a conversation with $GreaterIT shortly thereafter:\n\n>**$AssCM**: Did you purposely destroy this server so that we would have to buy a new one?  \n>  \n>**$GreaterIT**: (exasperated) Do you understand how much work it's going to be for me to repair and restore city hall's network because of this?  This is going to take me forever.  If I really wanted to destroy that server, I would have made sure I could get it back up again as quickly as possible!  \n>  \n>**$AssCM**: (acquiescing) Fine.  Just get us a good one this time.\n\nWe could have paid something like $30,000 for a server replacement prior to the budget being passed.  With the emergency repairs and all, though, we wound up paying closer to $50,000.  +66% value-added stupid tax.\n\nAs per usual, this wasn't all, of course.  Something else that had never been broached during **$ElderIT**'s time at the city was the concept of teaching online security.  Like, *ever*.  **$ElderIT** had *never once* hosted an internet security training or anything.  Apparently, he \"didn't think it was important.\"  I got to the city in 2017 - up until that point, literally no one had ever attended an online security training of any sort, whatsoever.  *Holy sh!t*.  Anyways, **$GreaterIT** wanted to make sure that we were doing something to train our users in good online hygiene policies - because, y'know, *he has a brain*.  He would later confide in me about the level of resistance he got from all levels of the enterprise.  I'd say that it was unbelievable the pushback he got, but I am also aware this is TFTS.\n\nOne of the first things that we did (together, actually) was hold some cybersecurity awareness presentations at the municipality's monthly safety meetings.  These were meetings to discuss safety issues, mostly going over the same useless pamphlets filled with common sense items like \"remember to drink water on a hot day\" or \"don't staple your hand to the wall.\"  Y'know, food for thought for the lowest common denominator.  Anyways, we had no materials on internet security whatsoever.  My position, as GIS Analyst, was actually within one of the admin departments, so I wound up having to go to these meetings.  And since I saw nothing in the realm of cybersecurity, I took it upon myself to create some simple presentations on this topic.  **$GreaterIT** picked up things from me and kept the ball rolling.\n\nBut I still remember that first presentation.  It was to all the department managers at the city.  I was going over warning signs in an email.  Simple stuff.  I said for them to take a moment and look for suspicious signs - check the sender, hover over any links to see if they are going to the correct place, check the email content, look for spelling errors, etc.  Before I could even finish speaking, the loud, obnoxious, abrasive garage manager barked out:\n\n>**$GarageMan**: (disdainful) Listen, we got real work to do.  I ain't got time to deal with all that.\n\nThis pissed me off immensely.  Not only did this a$$hat cut me off, this confirmed exactly what **$GreaterIT** had been saying to me about folks not giving a sh!t about proper cybersecurity procedures.  But I had an ace up my sleeve (for this conversation at least).  There had recently been an extremely high-profile ransomware attack that had happened at a nearby city due to a manager clicking on something they shouldn't have.  It had cost that city millions.  So I brought that up.\n\n>**$Me**: $GarageMan, you realize that it was a link in an email just like this one that downloaded the ransomware that took down <nearby city> last month?  And that the total costs to the city are estimated at about 1\/3rd its annual revenues?  And that the manager that clicked the email was found liable for the breach?  If you don't have time to take a moment to check your emails to make sure things are ok, then you'd better have the time to be liable for about $6 million in damages to the city instead.  You got time for that?  \n>  \n>**$Garageman**: (leaning back in his chair) .... No.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: (pissed look) Good.  Please pay attention to the rest of this.\n\nI don't particularly like dealing with a$$holes.  Being in Utilities has taught me to fire back when crap like this happens.  But all this merely goes to show the dismissive attitude towards internet safety that entirely suffused the city at this time (and, most importantly, what **$GreaterIT** had to try to work through).\n\nHowever, with repeated reinforcement over time, some of this started to gain a little traction.  Eventually, **$GreaterIT** was able to get a KnowBe4 training program up and running at the municipality.  Unfortunately, at the beginning, the responses to doing this training were less than stellar - particularly among the leadership of the city.  Most of these folks simply weren't doing it.  As you can imagine, the most common response to **$GreaterIT**'s inquiries was \"*I don't have time to do this*.\"  You all know it, you all love it.  Eventually, **$GreaterIT** escalated the matter.  He went first to **$AssCM**, but he got no help there - **$AssCM** didn't see a reason for doing the training himself and was probably one of the offenders to start with.  So **$GreaterIT** went beyond him to **$LadyCM**.  She, on the other hand, took things *very* seriously.  And she worked with **$GreaterIT** to put in place a system whereby if someone didn't finish their training within a certain time period, it would get sent to that person's immediate superior for a disciplinary review.  And if the person was one of the directors of the municipality?  The disciplinary hearing would go to *HER*.  Not something you want to be in.  *Ever*.  I am aware that at least one person got fired over this.  And as for **$GreaterIT**, it was one of his first major victories in his new role as IT Director.\n\nIt wouldn't be his last, as well.  About a year ago, **$GreaterIT** started to really put his foot down.  It began after a conversation he had with the leadership of the city during the start of the budgetary cycle.  In that meeting, **$GreaterIT** laid out his requests for the next year.  He brought up a ton of hardware issues we were suffering from (such as the bodycams he was assembling, Frankenstein-style, and then casting \"Reanimate\" upon).  From what he said after the fact, the conversation went something like this:\n\n>**$GreaterIT**: As a city, we need to increase the amount of funding going into technical support across pretty much every department.  What I am doing is not a solution, not even a temporary one.  These are only partial repairs that are guaranteed to fail.  None of this is sustainable.  And this can't be ignored - we rely on this technology and there are regulatory requirements in place.  Something must be done!  \n>  \n>**$AssCM**: Alright, well let's see where we can pull some funding.  We can hide the cost for some of your software in the budgets for the departments that are going to use them, and we can hide the cost for some of the camera hardware in the general service contracts for the public safety department, and we can -\"  \n>  \n>**$GreaterIT**: *NO*! (I am told that both $AssCM and $LadyCM were both immediately taken aback by this, $GreaterIT rarely raises his voice).  We cannot \"hide\" these expenses in other budgets any longer.  This is a core component of the city's operations!  You all have to be willing to invest in the bottom line for the technology we absolutely need.  And you need to be willing to address increases and requirements in the future, too!  Every single year, we have to pay more for salaries, electricity, insurance, fuel - you need to realize that we have to pay more for technology as well!  \n>  \n>**$AssCM**: ....  \n>  \n>**$LadyCM**: Alright.  Let's see what you have and address what we can.\n\nWith **$LadyCM** stepping into the ring on IT's side, it was decided.  **$GreaterIT** didn't wind up getting everything he asked for, but he did manage to get a tremendous amount.  The beltstraps on the starving belly of the IT budget were loosened a bit - and with ARPA funds coming in soon, they might need to do so once again!\n\n**$GreaterIT** has had even more successes in the time since.  He requested that he get another staff member to assist with the Tier 1 duties.  **$AssCM** approved a \"part-timer\" helpdesk position to be posted up, stating that if he could prove that the new staffmember had enough work to do, they would bring the person on full-time.  I will owe him a beer if he can't prove this within a month >:)  **$GreaterIT** has also been able to effectively deal with lusers abusing their technology (including firing the police officer with 4,000 hours of Candy Crush logged to his laptop).  And he's managed to cultivate a good relationship with **$LadyCM** \\- always a good thing to be friends with the big cheese!\n\n**$GreaterIT**'s journey has been a difficult one, I will admit.  When he first stepped into the role, there was so much to do.  He had so many challenges.  And even now, there's still so much left to address.  And he's a very humble guy - I don't think he likes lording over his successes or causing a fuss.  I know that the job has often gotten him down.  But I wanted to point out just how much he's managed to accomplish!  He's righted the ship quite well.  Many things he's done were pipe dreams for **$ElderIT**, and probably even seemed impossible for **$GreaterIT** when he first got the job.  But he still managed to do them!\n\nSo thank you, **$GreaterIT**!  You are a credit to your profession.  You are a credit to the municipality.  You are a credit to yourself!  And to all of you that feel like you've walked down a similar path, a huge thank you to y'all as well! :D\n\nHappy New Years, everyone, and thanks for reading! I'll have the last story up tomorrow!

Local IT ran desktop support and were the hands of Corporate IT for anything they couldn\u2019t do remotely.  But Local IT did not report to Corporate IT, we reported to the local hospital administration.  In theory, we were one happy family but there was a large disconnect between Corporate IT and Local IT.\n\nOur \u2018leader\u2019 of Local IT was IT Director \u2018Brillo\u2019.  Brillo was not a technical director by any definition.  He was strictly an administrative director.  However, Corporate IT would send him information as if he were a technical director.  Anything Brillo didn\u2019t understand, he would simply ignore.  Anything that changed \u2018without notice\u2019, would be blamed on Corporate IT not caring.\n\nOne day Brillo received an email that he didn\u2019t ignore.  Corporate IT was adding a new WiFi network for hospital employees to use with a slightly higher priority than the guest network.\n\nBrillo told administration and medical staff that this WiFi network was available everywhere.   Not just in the hospital buildings, but at home.  On the road.  On vacation!  No need to pay for Internet, you\u2019ve got \u201cThe Physician\u2019s Wireless\u201d!  \n\nBrillo called it the \u2018physician\u2019s wireless\u2019 so he could say that Corporate IT wanted it restricted to medical staff only, but he\u2019ll do you a favor and have one of HIS guys hook everyone else up too, you know, because Local rules and Corporate drools.  Or something like that.\n\nOnce we explained to that WiFi doesn\u2019t work like that, and that this wasn\u2019t a cellular connection of any sort, he of course blamed Corporate IT for being \u2018cheap\u2019 and limiting the range.  We thought he might get in at least a little bit of hot water for his claims, but no.  In the end, we had to explain to everyone the limits of the WiFi, set everyone up that wanted it, and Brillo went back to ignoring Corporate IT emails.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1672528771.0},{"title":"But I will get Electrocuted\u2026\u2026...","author":"Intelligent-Ad8967","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/1009cuv\/but_i_will_get_electrocuted\/","text":"Long Time Lurker First time Posting,\n\n**I currently work for a Media Solutions company that primarily deals with VDS panels, (basically, a TV that only displays assigned media content from our servers) and Media Players connected to Digital Displays in Movie Theaters and Bars.**\n\n**Earlier this year we had a Movie theater that was having issues with 3 of its Media Players connecting to the locations Network.

Do you see any random unplugged Ethernet cables directly around the SX-2, and SX-3 players?\u201d \n\n**I now start praying to the tech gods that the 2 network cables that are unplugged are the only 2 that are unplugged and that we are not facing a ball of cable spaghetti where we are going to have to figure out what cable goes where.**\n\nTech: \u201cI found 2 network cables. They are the only 2 I see but, the Clips are also broken off the RJ45 end.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cPerfect, looks like we are going to replace the 3 RJ45 ends and reconnect the cables to all 3 players.\u201d\n\nTech: \u201cOK I\u2019m going to have to go find the GM again because I\u2019m going to need to locate the breaker box to cut the power to the entire theater to replace those RJ45 ends.\u201d\n\n**After a brief pause** \n\nMe: \u201cWHAT????????\u201d \n\n**Thinking I misheard what the tech just said.**\n\nTech: \u201cI\u2019m going to have to go find the GM because I\u2019m going to need to locate the breaker box to cut the power to the entire theater to replace those RJ45 ends.

Ethernet cables are only 48 volts DC which is not a true electrocution hazard. The GM isn\u2019t going to let you cut the power off to the whole theater while customers are currently watching movies. You can cut and replace the cable without cutting the power to the entire theater.\u201d\n\nTech: \u201cNO!!!!!  I will be electrocuted and I\u2019m not dying so a Movie Theater can display digital menus and posters.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cWe are NOT asking the GM to cut the power to the entire theater to fix the RJ45 end. You can trace the Ethernet cable back to the modem or Hub and disconnect it from the other end and then there will be ZERO risk of electrocution while cutting the cable to repair it.\n\nTech: \u201cNO, it\u2019s not even worth fixing an old cable. Too much effort for questionable results. All 3 Cables will need to be replaced.\u201d\n\n**Head meets desk**\n\nMe: \u201cDo you have 3 20ft ethernet cables that can be used to replace the existing cables?\u201d\n\nTech: \u201cNo\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cOk so we will need to replace the RJ45 ends.\u201d\n\nTech: \u201cYea I don\u2019t feel safe doing that. You will need to send a new tech to replace the 3 cables cable because I\u2019m not getting electrocuted replacing those ends.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cIf you unplug the cable at the other end there is ZERO risk of electrocution.\u201d\n\nTech: \u201cYea I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d\n\n**At this point, I am ready to Yeet myself off a cliff.

Here is the next story from the municipality.  In this one, we'll talk about an \"IT guy\" that was hired to \"assist\" $GreaterIT and the shenanigans that ensued therein.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, and a lot that comes from rumors, gossip, and other people.  However some things are relatively recent, so any inaccuracies are entirely on me.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.\n\nTL\/DR: To be fair, I did eat all the cotton balls.\n\nFor some context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional. This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale. However, for reference, all these stories take place at my job at a municipality in the American South. Here is my Dramatis Personae for this part:\n\n* **$Me**: Masterful erudite.  Also me.\n* **$GreaterIT**: IT Director. Good guy, horribly overworked, I try to do all I can to make his life a little easier.\n* **$ThatGuy**: IT... Person?  Not sure of his actual title.  He sucked.\n* **$BigBoss**: The boss of the division I work at.  Very chill, easy-going, but likes things to work.\n* **$OpsMan**: Manager of the Utilities Field Operations team.  Super awesome guy, very supportive of all things GIS.\n* **$AssCM**: Assistant City Manager.  Actually a very nice guy, but horribly cheap and doesn't think of technology as a core part of the enterprise.  Unfortunately the villian of many a tale.\n* **$LadyCM**: Actual City Manager.  Absolutely awesome, one of the best people I've ever worked for, but is insanely busy all the time.\n\nYou may note that in many of my tales from the municipality, most of the issues I deal with are from external parties - contractors, developers, private companies, other jurisdictions, so on.  Well, there's a reason for that.  By and large, most of my coworkers are actually pretty good at what they do and are competent in their positions.  It's the people from outside the city that we have problems with.  Sort of a baffling realization for me, coming from the intense disfunction of my previous job.\n\nAnyhoo, today we'll talk about one of the city's few bad apples.  An IT \"person\" we'll call **$ThatGuy**.\n\nYears ago, **$GreaterIT** took over for the previous IT Director when he retired (if you'll remember, I called the old director **$ElderIT** in a previous story).  One of the conditions of taking on this role was that **$GreaterIT** would be able to hire some additional staff to assist him with everything that he had to do - he was already stretched even before taking on the directorship.  In truth, even at that time, **$GreaterIT** really wanted a staff of 3 in the department he would be overseeing - a Tier 1 helpdesk person, a Tier 2 person dedicated to higher issues, and himself as director to oversee preventative maintenance, long-term planning, tech projects, etc.  After rounds of negotiations between the City Council and **$AssCM**, the city's leadership decided to accede to one of these demands - they would hire another high-level IT professional.  And so a posting went up for a \"Computer Programmer\" (because nobody in authority actually knows what the fsck IT does), a position paying just about as much as what **$GreaterIT** was making.\n\nThe hiring process was fraught with shenaningans.  **$GreaterIT** was beset on all sides by different people telling him to \"hire this one guy, he's great.\"  **$GreaterIT** did his best to stay impartial during the process, but it was incredibly difficult.  Eventually he settled on giving an offer to a very skilled professional who had worked at a nearby county.  Unfortunately the guy ghosted us - I was to find out later that he'd taken a very high-level *GIS* job instead!\n\nAfter finding out that his preferred candidate had taken another position, **$GreaterIT** was inundated with even more interference from across the city.  One department framed this as less of a request and more of a demand.  The public safety department had been auguring to get one of their preferred candidates hired, and now that **$GreaterIT**'s first choice had abandoned us, they doubled-down.  They had existing connections with this person anyway and said that his skills were \"top-notch.\"  Most importantly, he had a ton of experience with radios, something that was of particular importance to the police department.  Their \"request\" was something like \"you *NEED* to hire this guy.\"  Eventually, needing someone to assist and tired of putting up with all the BS, **$GreaterIT** acquiesced.\n\nEnter **$ThatGuy**.\n\n**$ThatGuy** managed to start off on the wrong foot with, well, pretty much everyone.  His attitude certainly didn't help.  He had a very snarky \"*you-should-know-this*\" type of approach to anyone that came to him with a question.  He'd give us half-answers or no real answer at all.  I remember one time right after he'd gotten hired, I received an email that looked weird.  It was really a KnowBe4 training, but the link had some odd characters in it.  Think substitutions for quotation marks that were things like \"&%\", but I wasn't really certain.  As such, I forwarded the email to **$ThatGuy** for clarification.  This was our conversation:\n\n>**$Me**: I got this email, not sure if it's legit or not.  The characters don't all line up to the link.  \n>  \n>**$ThatGuy**: What does the link direct you to?  \n>  \n>**$Me**: It looks mostly the same, but there are a few characters that are different.  Is this legit or not?  \n>  \n>**$ThatGuy**: What does the link direct you to?  \n>  \n>**$Me**: To a link where a couple of the characters are different, but only a couple and I can't tell if that's normal.  Seriously, is this legit or not?\n\nI followed up with him several times over text and all, and his answer was always the same - *what was the link pointing me to*?  Y'all, I'm not IT, I don't know the nuances of how hyperlinks are crafted.  All that mattered to me was that a couple of characters looked different.  So since **$ThatGuy** was pretty much just telling me to make up my mind on this, I deleted the email.  A couple of weeks later I got fussed at for not completing my KnowBe4 training.  **$ThatGuy** reached out to me about it:\n\n>**$ThatGuy**: Why didn't you complete your training?  \n>  \n>**$Me**: Was that the email I deleted?  I got rid of it because it didn't look right to me.  You told me to look at the link, and the characters in the text didn't all match up.  \n>  \n>**$ThatGuy**: That was the KnowBe4 training!  I didn't tell you to delete it, I told you to look at the link!  \n>  \n>**$Me**: I *DID* look at the link.  Come on, man, if I ask a yes-or-no question, please give me a yes-or-no answer.\n\nAs you can see, my first interactions with **$ThatGuy** didn't particularly endear me to him.  For others, however, it was apparently much worse.  Within short order, *nobody* wanted to deal with him.  If anyone had an IT question, they would purposely request that **$GreaterIT** come and deal with it; if **$ThatGuy** was assigned to it, they'd refuse to let him work the problem.  Or they \"wouldn't be available\" when he came over.  You remember how the public safety department demanded that **$GreaterIT** hire this guy?  Within three months of him starting, that department refused to allow him to troubleshoot anything and would request that all tickets\/requests go to **$GreaterIT** instead.  Good job, dipsh!t.\n\nHonestly, I could have overlooked the attitude if **$ThatGuy** had been good at what he did or diligent in his job.  After all, I don't really expect all IT folks to be super-personable.  But **$ThatGuy** failed even there.  It didn't take long for folks to realize that the tickets he worked on were either half-done or not finished at all.  In most cases, all it seemed like he would do is hang out in the IT office, his feet up on the desk and leaning back in his chair, listening to the random yokel BS being flung back and forth on the local CV radio channels in the area.  There was one sparkle to this gilded t\\*rd, however, in that we always knew that he'd be in the office.  **$GreaterIT** was in pretty hot demand, so he'd usually be somewhere else putting out fires all across the city.  If we had a problem on something, invariably we knew that we could go down to the IT office and **$ThatGuy** would be there.  The issue was, of course, that we'd then have to deal with him.  Thus, we either could get good IT support from someone that was rarely in the office (**$GreaterIT**), or terrible \"support\" from someone that was always there (**$ThatGuy**).  Those are the types of choices that get me going in the morning!\n\nThere was one high-profile fsck-up that happened a few months after **$ThatGuy** started that I remember very clearly.  **$GreaterIT** was going on vacation for a few days to visit his family out of state and left **$ThatGuy** in charge with a list of things for him to take care of.  One task was setting up a new printer for **$LadyCM**.  Just to make you aware, **$LadyCM** is the city manager - the boss, head honcho, el numero uno, Lord of the Rings, the Bourne Identity... Taxi Driver... Jaws...  Anyways, she's in charge of the whole shindig.  And while she's actually very understanding and pleasant, there's something to be said about first impressions.  **$ThatGuy** received the new printer from the reps, watched them set it up, and then... *didn't do anything else*.  At all.  He didn't get it connected to **$LadyCM**'s computer, didn't test it, didn't put it on the print server, didn't do anything with it.  In fact, I actually have no idea what he actually did in this whole process.  **$LadyCM** had wanted to use the printer immediately and couldn't - *this did not make her particularly happy*.  She waited until **$GreaterIT** got back, had him finish setting it up, and then voiced her displeasure to him.  The sort of quiet, gentle \"voicing of displeasure\" that portends the initiation of a blood sacrifice...\n\n**$GreaterIT** came to commiserate with me one afternoon after this fiasco.  He said **$ThatGuy** hadn't done *most* of what he'd assigned, but the failure on this printer was the worst thing.  Of all the tasks that he could have dropped the ball on, he had to do it on *this*?!  **$GreaterIT** was now in the hotseat about it and lots of folks were looking far more critically at IT.  Man, I'd have fired **$ThatGuy** right then, to be honest, but **$GreaterIT** has more patience than me.  Whatever, not my monkey, not my circus.  I'm sure **$GreaterIT** figured he really needed the assistance at the time, no matter how shitty **$ThatGuy** was.  But I can't help but think that the perception that **$ThatGuy** had cultivated for himself would continue to persist among the highest levels of the city for a long, long time.\n\nMore sh!t started to flow from this man-shaped sphincter over time as well.  Something that always puzzled me was his approach to IT support tickets.  Y'all, I'm aware that most professional IT people like to use a ticketing system.  It's there to prioritize and triage work.  It's also usually effective in maintaining communication and documentation about the issues.  For whatever reason, **$ThatGuy** didn't seem to want to use the ticketing system at all.  When I first started reaching out to him to get work done (by submitting tickets like a good little user), he would usually text me the resolution on my phone.  I knew that these texts didn't get submitted to the ticketing system because we would receive an email alert anytime anything changed on one of our tickets.  After getting this a few times, I sent him a response saying that I was going to put this into the ticket through my email and for him to start responding through the ticketing system too.  After all, I know that this is how y'all keep appraised of what is actually happening on your work.\n\n**$ThatGuy**'s response was that \"he was just trying to get me the answers quicker.\"  I honestly didn't care.  I know that documentation is important.  For me, getting things done quick is nice, but getting things done *right* is best.  After doing this for a while where I would put in the info he texted to me into the ticket, I reached out to **$GreaterIT** and asked him to get **$ThatGuy** to work through the ticketing system, not texts.  Please understand this - I was a *USER* requesting that the *IT PROFESSIONAL* use the ticketing system.  The absurdity was not lost on me.  Eventually, **$ThatGuy** must have gotten yelled at enough that he stopped doing this.  But the fact that he didn't seem to recognize the importance of the ticketing system, nor did he like using it, made it seem like he really didn't know what he was doing as an IT professional at all... *hmmm*...\n\nThings continued to go downhill.  One of the next issues regarded mobile devices for our utilities field operations team.  I had been hard at work trying to get GIS webmaps and applications rolled out to our field crews.  Part of that setup was ensuring that they all had smartphones.  I got confirmation from **$OpsMan** to purchase devices for everybody, so I sent a list off to IT with the total number of devices to be purchased, where the funds were to buy them, what accounts needed to be set up for them, and what apps needed to be pre-loaded onto the devices.  I also gave them lists of all the users and provided a workflow.  There were about 30 devices we needed.  I was also willing to wait for a long time to get all of this and was prepared to do things in batches of 5-6 users at a time.  **$GreaterIT** passed this off to **$ThatGuy**, since taken altogether, this seemed like a fairly easy project.  We didn't have any sort of mobile deployment at the time but I had provided information for everything.  Just read the notes, rinse and repeat for each device.  What could be simpler?\n\n*Hoo boy*.\n\nWe started this process in November.  We didn't finish until March.  Every single phone I received from **$ThatGuy** was fscked up in some way.  For some, he forgot to install the apps they needed.  Others, he forgot to set up a Google Play account.  Others, he forgot to get an email account set up in our municipality's active directory.  Others, he forgot to set up the MFA.  Others, he set up the wrong credentials on the phone (so Phone A had Person B's email account but Person A's phone number).  Some had a login pin code, others didn't.  And so on and so forth.  Thankfully I was able to fix most of the issues on my own.  But almost every single device had problems, and when we got to the end of the deployment we were missing phones, email addresses, phone numbers, Google accounts, and more.  It was a nightmare.  And some things I couldn't fix - I had to indulge his snarky attitude when I went down there to try and get things corrected.  >:(\n\nJust to say, I'm certain that you competent IT folks would have been able to do everything this j!zz rag did in the space of a week or two, if not a day or so.\n\nAs terrible as this is, the worst was yet to come.  There are a couple crew leaders on the field ops team that don't have the greatest eyesight.  They love using the GIS apps, but really need some larger text and screen real estate.  We had pioneered loading these apps onto iPads for the Fire Department trucks and it worked great, so I decided to request the same for the field guys too.  **$OpsMan** was totally onboard with the idea (he's an Apple cultist), so I submitted a ticket to order a couple of chip-enabled iPads (I hope that's the correct terminology).  This would give us iPads with phone chips inside them giving the devices a phone number and allowing them to use data through the cell phone network - preventing the need for a separate hotspot.  Pretty awesome setup.  I made sure to connect the two folks I was ordering these devices for on the IT ticket as well.\n\nAgain, this was relegated to **$ThatGuy**.  He sent me a response on the ticket saying that the devices I wanted were on backorder and it would take a while.  I was ok with that, I know there's delays in everything right now, so I responded as such.  And then I waited.  And waited.  For months, I waited.  I basically forgot about it.  About a year later, I went out into the field with one of the guys I had ordered a device for.  We got to talking, and I remembered that I'd ordered something for him a while back.  I asked if he'd received it - he said no, the last time he heard about it was when I'd connected him on the ticket.  WTF?  After finishing up in the field, I headed back to the IT office and immediately inquired as to what had happened.  Swiveling around in his chair, **$ThatGuy** looked at me with an incredulous expression.\n\n>**$ThatGuy**: Oh, you still wanted those things?\n\n*WHAT!?!*  Of course I still wanted the devices!  What gave you the impression that I didn't?  **$ThatGuy** then looked sort of peeved and asked if I could submit a new ticket, as he \"was having trouble finding\" the old one.  I did so.  I was to find out later that once I'd responded the first time, **$ThatGuy** had subsequently *closed the ticket without informing me*.  This in and of itself was a huge no-no.  The ticketing system is set up to push an email notification anytime anything changes on the ticket.  **$ThatGuy** purposely *turned off the notifications* and then closed the ticket so that I wouldn't see that he'd done so.  What a piece of sh!t.  Also, wtf?  Why did he close the ticket to start with?  Did he think my agreeing to wait for the devices to come in meant that I didn't want them anymore?  Christ!\n\nI wound up putting up with this for a while, in fact.  It would turn out that **$OpsMan** eventually got fed up with how long it was taking **$ThatGuy** to order devices and ordered some himself (using our standard providers and going through the proper channels).  These devices were destined for other people, however.  When **$ThatGuy** saw that two devices had been ordered by the utilities department, he closed my ticket *AGAIN* without telling me.  It would take a year and a half before I was able to get the iPads to the crew leaders that had originally requested them. \\*slap\\*\n\nOne final bit of terribleness.  Once **$BigBoss** saw that a bunch of field crew staff were getting these really nice iPads with cool GIS apps and snazzy covers, he decided that he wanted some for the administration team.  After all, management has to have all the nice toys too, right?  Lol :)  Anyways, I ordered a few for them and eventually they came in.  Once they got here, however, I went to deliver them to **$BigBoss** and the other folks - *and they were smeared with what looked like grease all over the screens*!  What the h3ll?  Y'all, this is so fscking gross... but it looked as though **$ThatGuy** had been sweating profusely or licking his fingers or some sh!t and then rubbing it all over the iPads when he was setting them up!  Sorry, I just vomited a little in my mouth there.  I wound up getting some alcohol and cleaning everything before I delivered them.  More to the point, I sent a very strongly-worded email to **$GreaterIT** that this was totally unacceptable - these are thousand-dollar productivity devices, not some kid's chew toy.  Ugh.  So disgusting.\n\nYou may be wondering - why the h3ll wasn't this guy let go?  Well, there was a lot at play here.  On the one hand, **$GreaterIT** really did need help (though I would strongly argue that what **$ThatGuy** was doing was causing him *MORE* work than it was saving him).  On the other hand, it wasn't so simple as letting him go and getting the department that **$GreaterIT** wanted\/needed.  Most of the work that **$ThatGuy** was doing was basically Tier 1 duties, so **$GreaterIT** had been arguing for years to try and get an actual helpdesk person.  **$GreaterIT**'s ultimate goal was to bring in someone to take care of the backlog of mundane tickets, put **$ThatGuy** onto the Tier 2 work that he was actually hired to do, and then assess him in that role.  If he failed in those tasks, there would be justification to let him go and hire someone that could actually do the work.\n\nThe management of the city, however, particularly **$AssCM** (who is in charge of city operations), didn't see it that way.  To make you aware, when it comes to technology, **$AssCM** doesn't know his a$$ from a hole in the ground.  He doesn't recognize just how much work it is to cover all the mundane tickets that come in every hour of every day.  He doesn't realize how much work it is to run infosec, tech maintenance, fix bugs and crashes, and all that.  He doesn't understand that **$GreaterIT** can't \"just go home at the end of the day\" when there is technology that *MUST* be up and running 24\/7 all across the enterprise, otherwise things *will* crash, *will* fail, and *will* cause a disaster.  He doesn't seem to comprehend that a one-person IT department is NOT sufficient for a city of our magnitude and complexity.  **$GreaterIT** understands this, I understand this, most people reading understand this; **$AssCM** does not.\n\nSo **$GreaterIT**'s pleas for another person were met with responses like \"you are trying to cover for **$ThatGuy**, just make him do his job.\"  **$GreaterIT** was *NOT* trying to cover for **$ThatGuy** \\- he was trying to *GET RID* of him.  But justification was needed.  Eventually, **$GreaterIT** decided that, even if he didn't have any backup, it was worth it to try to get rid of **$ThatGuy**.  He spoke with the city's HR Director and asked her if he could put **$ThatGuy** on an action plan for poor performance.  The HR Director, similarly tired of **$ThatGuy**'s shenanigans, was very supportive.  The two of them put crafted something together.  The HR Director also informed **$GreaterIT** that he could enforce the decision of the action plan.  A couple of days later, I saw **$GreaterIT**, **$ThatGuy**, and the HR Director heading into a meeting in the city's council chambers...\n\nI never knew the exact details of **$ThatGuy**'s action plan.  But all of a sudden, his attitude to most of us changed.  He was no longer smarmy or snarky.  He seemed to get back to us quicker.  He used the ticketing system for all communication.  He even seemed kind of... anxious every time I spoke to him.  But the quality of his work really never improved.  Things still got dropped by the wayside.  Stuff was half-done, at best.  Some folks even got their tickets canceled.  Things would have to come to a head.\n\nA few weeks later, I came into work and got an email notification that the door code had been changed.  That was odd.  Normally that was only done if somebody got fired.  I came into the office and spoke to one of my friends (**$Fiery**, if you recall from a previous story).  Did someone get let go?\n\n>**$Fiery**: Yeah, $ThatGuy quit last Friday.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: Oh. \\*shrugging\\* Well that makes sense.\n\n**$Fiery** laughed along with me.  I was eventually to discover that **$GreaterIT** had met with **$ThatGuy** over his action plan.  He told **$ThatGuy** that he was failing it, and rather than stick it out till the end, **$ThatGuy** just walked out on the spot.  We had to redo all the codes to the city in the wake of everything but it was a minor detail overall.  I'd like to say that this was the end of things but I would find out plenty more in the ensuing months.\n\nEventually, **$GreaterIT** came to talk to me about everything he'd dealt with in the aftermath of **$ThatGuy**'s tenure.  It was then that I found out about all my tickets that had been closed without informing me.  But far worse was something else.  Apparently, while he was here, **$ThatGuy** had paired a personal Google account with his municipal credentials in the Active Directory (I don't know how he did this and I'm pretty sure this is an immense breach of security, he likely could be prosecuted for this).  When **$GreaterIT** discovered this, he accessed the account to see what in the hell it was.  Turns out, the account linked to a vast array of YouTube videos basically showing someone how to do every facet of **$ThatGuy**'s job.  This wouldn't have been a particularly bad idea if it had been done with a city-based account and all.  However, for our purposes, it meant that **$ThatGuy** wound up relying on these videos for *EVERYTHING* he did here.  And if something wasn't shown in the video, he didn't do it.  He never took any notes about anything he did (or was supposed to do) and he couldn't think on his feet for any aspect of the job.\n\nRemember when I speculated that **$ThatGuy** didn't act like a real IT professional?  That's because, essentially, he wasn't.  He'd never worked in this field before.  All his previous experience was radio support either in the military or law enforcement.  He didn't know how to use the tools that tech support people use; he didn't know really anything about the job at all.  He basically finagled his expertise with radios into a high-paying IT support job that he was manifestly unqualified for.  Sorry, **$GreaterIT** :(\n\nWith **$ThatGuy** departing, amazingly it appeared that the workload lightened on **$GreaterIT** a tiny bit.  He wound up getting someone from a consulting firm to come in to help part-time and this has contributed immensely.  **$AssCM** was shocked to learn that **$GreaterIT** had let **$ThatGuy** go, even though that's exactly what had been conveyed to him in their many meetings.  I am consistently amazed by the number of manglers that go all shockedpikachu.png when people do exactly what they say they are going to do.\n\nRegardless, the sweaty shadow of **$ThatGuy** is no longer obnoxiously looming over us all.  I think the skies on the horizon just might be a little bit clearer for everybody.  *Ah, yes* :)\n\nThanks for reading, everybody! I'll have the next story up tomorrow!

Here is the next story from my job at the municipality.  In this one, I get to deal with a bunch of engineers and inform them about how they are not geographers.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, and a lot that comes from rumors, gossip, and other people.  However some things are relatively recent, so any inaccuracies are entirely on me.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.\n\nTL\/DR: The drive!  The power!  The skills!  The motivation!  The power, again!  The fortitude!  The strive!  The ideals!  The list of attributes!\n\nFor some context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional. This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale. However, for reference, all these stories take place at my job at a municipality in the American South. Here is my Dramatis Personae for this part:\n\n* **$Me**: Masterful erudite.  Also me.\n* **$OldCM**: The old city manager.  She was pretty awesome and did a lot of good, but had to navigate through the miasma of \"good-ole-boy-ism\" pervasive at the time.\n* **$BigBoss**: The boss of the division I work at.  Very chill, easy-going, but likes things to work.\n* **$EngCo**: Contracted civil engineering company.  Did very good engineering work.  Did terrible GIS work.\n* **$CADGuy**: The AutoCAD manager at $EngCo.  An absolute whiz at AutoCAD but not great at GIS products.  Very nice guy, I liked him quite a bit.\n* **$SurveyEngineer**: The engineer in charge of the surveying teams.  Enthusiastic, boisterous, and not the smartest.\n* **$BigEngineer**: Primary engineer working on our contract.  Cocky, overconfident, and pretentious.  Thought he knew everything about GIS.  We'll see how that pans out >:D\n\nSo I have read countless stories from you all about having to deal with folks in the highest echelons of professions that require a great deal of education and expertise.  Generally speaking, your interactions come in one of two flavors; either the professional is very nice and easy to get along with; or they are the most entitled sort of diva imaginable that cannot be wrong in *anything*.  There never seems to be anything in between.  I tend to group the worst offenders into the \"Four Corners of the House of Troubles\" - namely, Doctors, Engineers, Lawyers, and Professors.  Unfortunately for me, I've had the pleasure of working with each of them.  Some of my interactions have been very positive.  Most, however, have not.  Today we'll talk about the second corner - namely, Engineers.\n\nFor whatever reason, most engineers I have dealt with (mostly civil engineers) are extremely dismissive of GIS.  They don't hold the software in high regard and seem to view us GIS professionals with disdain (particularly the engineers from smaller firms).  More to the point, in numerous situations, these civil engineers seem to think that they know vastly more about geographic science than they actually do.  I really don't understand why this is.  Every one of my peers that I have spoken to (in my line of work) have reported the same types of interactions.  I've read some articles online to try and figure out why this is; one of the most compelling arguments I found was that many engineers view GIS software as sort of the \"little brother\" to AutoCAD - which is the \"*real*\" suite to be used for digital representation.  After all, it can be pretty difficult to draw minute detail in ArcGIS, and engineers can't really use \"drawings\" in GIS that are within a tolerance of +\/- 2 ft, can they?  Furthermore, engineers are the ones trained to use *real* math and science in their work.  And engineering is by far the more prestigious field of study.  Anything else is substantiatively pedestrian.\n\n**Ahem**.\n\nMy feelings aside, let's talk about this, shall we?  Engineers that regard GIS software as an \"imprecise drafting program\" are committing the original sin - they are using the program for a purpose which it wasn't designed.  Like trying to trim your beard with a lightsaber.  You can do it, but you have to be extremely skilled to do so, and don't come complaining to me that you cut your head off.  When looking at something on a scale equal to the whole United States, +\/- 2 ft is a literally insignificant rounding error - and distance is always relative to start with.  Civil engineers *really* don't like me saying that.  They also don't understand database management or attribute association.  A flattened PDF with a picture of an Excel table is not a \"database.\"  And if I get one more as-built from a developer that states it is on the \"Mean Sea Level Datum,\" I'm going to have an aneurism.\n\n\/endrant\n\nOur story begins about 25 years ago.  Back in those halcyon days, the municipality was rife with agreements that were predicated \"on a handshake.\"  *Just some good ole boys, never meanin' no harm...*  In this situation, an \"understanding\" was reached with a local engineering company, **$EngCo**.  This company would become our \"firm of record\", meaning they would get first pick on any of our engineering projects and in some cases we would simply provide work to them directly without competitive bidding at all.  I think the original point was to just have some consistency in what we were receiving from our developers.  After all, having a private company doing all our work with no competition and no accountability has never proven troublesome to anybody else, right?  I think you can all see where this is going...\n\nLet me just point out that, despite the setup here, there are actually a lot of folks to like at **$EngCo**.They honestly do have a lot of very intelligent, educated people working for them.  And the company is made up of many local citizens of the municipality - folks that, by and large, want to make sure things work out alright for their home.  The problems have only arisen when the company attempts to reach out and take on work that is outside their expertise.  And unfortunately, they view GIS as within their wheelhouse.  It is resoundingly *NOT*. surprisedpikachu.png\n\nThe first example occurred about 15 years ago.  At that time, the city had inherited a private utility system.  **$BigBoss** had just been hired and wanted to make sure that we had good locational information since the private company's records were atrocious (after all, we took them over because they couldn't pay their bills).  With this in mind, he set up an RFP (Request For Proposal) for a locating project and then sent it out for competitive bids.  **$EngCo** sent him a one-page summary of what they would do; clearly, they didn't give it much thought since they figured they'd get the bid as a matter of course.  Numerous other companies sent in bids as well, though, and each was substantially more detailed than **$EngCo**'s.  Several even came on-site and showed **$BigBoss** what they could do!  **$BigBoss** was particularly impressed with one of the outside companies.  They were able to do some excellent GIS work and for a lower cost than **$EngCo**!  So he recommended that the city go with this company instead.\n\nHOLY CRAP, the sh!tshow that ensued.  One of the primary engineers from **$EngCo**, a blustery guy we'll call **$BigEngineer**, showed up at the city council meeting where this was being decided and tore **$BigBoss** a new one.  He called **$BigBoss** every name under the sun, told the council that there was no reason why their company should have been passed up for this, and that this was unacceptable considering their relationship.  **$BigBoss** genuinely thought he was going to lose his job.  Eventually, though, the director of utilities at the time (**$BigBoss**'s boss), who was just as big of an a$$hole as **$BigEngineer**, told the council that he trusted **$BigBoss**'s decision and that was that.  The city eventually went with the external company instead of **$EngCo**.  Clearly, the city's council meetings back then had far less discussion and far more urine-spraying and chest-pounding than meetings today.  There are still stains on the floor.\n\nAnyways, you can see how this sort of soured the relationship between **$EngCo** and the municipality generally (and **$BigBoss** specifically).  However, it would take a few years for something of this magnitude to raise its head again.\n\nAbout five years later, the municipality decided to do a major refurbishment to the utility lines in the oldest section of the city.  This was an enormous project - probably the largest in our history (to point out, the cost of the project was like five times the city's annual budget!)  As could be assumed, **$EngCo** got the contract to design and build everything.\n\nTwo years into the project, **$BigBoss** had a discussion with **$OldCM**.  **$BigBoss** wanted to make sure that we could get good GIS data from this massive project - if we could get it on the front end while the assets were being put into the ground, that would save us an ungodly amount of work in the future.  **$OldCM** agreed, so she went to **$EngCo** to try and get this set up.  Let me say that **$OldCM** did a tremendous amount of good for our city in weeding out the corruption and inefficiencies that had been piling up for decades.  Yet despite this, she still tended towards certain \"gentleman's agreements\" whenever there was no other clear way.  Her discussion with **$EngCo** fell into that category.\n\n**$OldCM** spoke with **$EngCo** and they created an amendment to the standing contract.  The amendment stated that the city would pay **$EngCo** several hundred thousand dollars to collect GIS information about the new assets being put in.  There was a severe lack of understanding as to what was being requested by both parties when this happened, however.  **$EngCo** didn't really understand what \"GIS information\" really meant.  And at the time, the city didn't have any professional GIS capability either, so **$OldCM** didn't know what to ask for.  Seriously, I read the \"scope of work\" years later; the only statement that brought up GIS at all read as this:\n\n><$EngCo> will provide GIS data for all <asset> locations to be used by the Utilities Department.\n\nThat was it.  No indication of attribute data that would need to be collected, no information on schemas or who it would go to, nothing even on the file format that it had to be provided in.  Managers tossing buzzwords.  Nothing else.  Ugh.  And because this was, basically, a \"gentleman's agreement\", **$OldCM** wrote the addendum herself and signed it without needing to get the council or anyone else involved.  *Seems legit*.  **$BigBoss** didn't even know the details about it until years later when I unearthed it while investigating everything.\n\nAnyways, I was hired by the municipality during the latter stages of this refurbishment project.  As things were wrapping up, **$BigBoss** tasked me with making certain that all the appropriate GIS data had been collected; the engineering firm wanted to confirm that all the punch list items were completed so they could say that the project was finished (and get paid, of course).  So I got started looking into everything.  Holy sh!t, y'all.  If this would have been a quest, it would have had a skull on the level requirement.\n\n*I donned my fedora and ventured forth into the filing cabinets from another age.*\n\nThe first thing I did was ask to see where the directive was for the GIS aspects of the project.  Nobody knew where the signed agreement was.  I started looking for it but it would take months before I was able to finally locate it.\n\nIn the meantime, it was my understanding that \"GIS data\" by its very nature included attribute information with the features so provided.  So I reached out to **$EngCo** with a fairly simplistic schema - a list of fields that I thought they'd be able to easily provide using the information already collected.  Simple stuff like the diameter of the pipes, what they were made out of, what types of valves were in place, so on.  I only asked for about 3-5 fields for each type of feature, and only asked for about 5 features.  When I got on the phone with the staff at **$EngCo**, the response was as follows:\n\n>**$BigEngineer**: Sure!  Let me write up a scope of work and get you a quote, and we'll get right on that.\n\nWait a minute - wasn't this covered under the scope of work we already had?  If wasn't, why not?  I immediately told **$BigEngineer** to hold it because I wanted to get to the bottom of this.  If the company wasn't providing information like what I asked for, what exactly were they giving us?  As can be assumed, **$BigEngineer** didn't know.\n\nSo while I waited for more information to try and find the original scope of work, I set about attempting to decipher what exactly it was that **$EngCo** was doing.  My next detour took me to the teams out in the field performing the surveys on all the new infrastructure going into the ground.  One of the city's field crew members invited me to head out and speak with them.  The teams were headed by an obnoxiously loud guy we'll call **$SurveyEngineer**.  When I arrived in the field with them, they had a GPS survey system set up and were fiddling with it.  Our very first conversation went something like this:\n\n>**$SurveyEngineer**: Alright!  Here's how we've been getting positions for everything in this entire project! Watch out cuz *we're gonna blow your mind*! (I don't remember his exact words, but this guy actually said something like that - I was already in a bad mood about all this and it just pushed me over the edge.  Also, WTF?)  \n>  \n>**$Me**: (completely nonplussed) Yeah, I know how a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) unit works.  I'm not really worried about that.  What I am far more concerned about is the attribute information are you collecting.  \n>  \n>**$SurveyEngineer**: (deflated) Oh.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: Are you collecting anything about the assets when you put them in the ground?  Size?  Manufacturer?  Model?  Anything else?  \n>  \n>**$SurveyEngineer**: Uh... we get the coordinates and then send them on.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: I'll take that as no, then.  Where are you sending the locations?  Is it going to an enterprise server?  ArcGIS Online?  Something else?  \n>  \n>**$SurveyEngineer**: Um... no, it all goes to $CADGuy, I think.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: (incredulous) Wait, this is being sent to AutoCAD?  You can't be serious.  Who is handling your GIS intake and asset management?  \n>  \n>**$SurveyEngineer**: Uh... I don't know what that means.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: Do you have any professional GIS expertise at your company at all?  \n>  \n>**$SurveyEngineer**: Um... we have $CADGuy.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: (swearing under my breath) You've got to be kidding me.  Well thanks for your time.  That tells me all I need to know.\n\nYes folks.  We were paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to **$EngCo** for GIS services - *and this company did not have a single GIS professional on staff*. \\*facepalm\\*\n\nEventually, after going through rabbit hole after rabbit hole, I managed to find the original GIS addendum to the project.  As I mentioned above, this was the first time **$BigBoss** had ever seen the details.  By all accounts, it looked like there were basically no requirements laid upon **$EngCo** whatsoever in the data they provided to us.  They could give us almost anything they wanted and we'd have to accept it as fulfilling what we'd paid for.\n\nAfter dozens of phone calls and pouring over all sorts of documentation, I was eventually able to provide a definitive answer for the rest of the city on what **$EngCo** was doing regarding all this.  It had become clear to me by this time that the company had no comprehension of what GIS actually was.  They had conflated the terms \"GIS\" (*Geographic Information Systems*) with \"GPS\" (*Global Positioning System*) in the original agreement, and thought that all we wanted was very accurate locational data.  The worst part about this was that we actually required coordinate information any time someone submitted records to us - in essence, we had been paying them the better part of a million dollars *for data they were supposed to give us anyway*!  Jesus.  I worked extensively with **$CADGuy** to try and get the output information in a way that I could use easily.  **$CADGuy** was awesome, and he really did all he could to help, but he was not a GIS professional.  He didn't even have the software he needed to convert things.  All he could get me were AutoCAD .dwgs and an Excel spreadsheet of the asset tags with coordinates.  The AutoCAD data didn't have the tags associated with any of the geometries, so it was essentially useless.  Eventually, when the leadership of the city came to me and asked if **$EngCo** had fulfilled what they were supposed to do with this GIS data, I had to report that yes, they had, simply because we'd never told them what to fscking do in the first place!!!\n\nWe paid close to ten times my yearly salary for an Excel file with three columns.  So that was fun.  **$BigBoss** was not pleased.  I was not either.\n\nA short time later, I pitched a GIS support services contract to **$BigBoss** and the leadership of the city.  If you'll recall, I was originally hired to help the city establish a GIS architecture.  Bringing in the utilities assets was a huge part of that.  Having some additional professional help could bring us closer to that goal.  I'd met some reps from a GIS firm at a conference the previous year; we'd been working with them on a time-and-effort basis and I wanted to solidify everything into a full-time contract.  Due to the way the contract was structured, it was more of a \"*hire who can do the work*\" than a \"*get the lowest bidder*\" type of thing, thus I had a little more freedom in who I could choose.  As soon as **$EngCo** got wind of it, though, they demanded a meeting with me.\n\nA few days later, I had an ornery **$BigEngineer**, a tired-looking **$CADGuy**, and a couple of other engineers from **$EngCo** in my office.  I think they may have been wary to be too pushy with me - there had already been a lot of acrimony between the company and the city by this point and it was only growing (major cost overruns during the utility refurbishment project as well as past backdoor dealings).  However, it was also clear that **$BigEngineer** wanted to show that my GIS work was something that **$EngCo** clearly *could* and *should* do.  He started off by saying that they had a lot of experience with our system (completely true), that they had finally gotten with the times and had \"ArcMap\" (which was already on its last update and slated for EOL), and that they could provide us with any GIS services we needed (not true).  Y'all, I could have just said \"Thanks, we'll let you know if we decide anything\" and just waved them out of my office.  But I know what is required to do good GIS work.  I take pride in what I do.  This guy - and this company - could not produce the kind of quality work that would have been acceptable to me.  And if I didn't stop this now, we would keep getting these pitches in the future until, at some point, somebody would make a bad decision and hire them for this kind of stuff once more.\n\nAfter **$BigEngineer** said that they could provide us with anything else we needed, I looked at him and shook my head.\n\n>**$Me**: I'm sorry.  I hate to point this out, but I have to disagree.\n\nThe first person to react was **$CADGuy** \\- his eyes shot open and his face slowly pulled up into a smirk, probably the first time I'd ever seen him truly liven up.  I am certain he's had to deal with more than one ridiculous request from his bosses and liked seeing someone turn it around on them.  **$BigEngineer**'s face, however, turned into a mask of shock, the image you'd expect a petulant man-child that has not been told \"no\" enough in his life to have.  For a moment, he didn't respond, then turned red and accusingly blurted out something to the effect of \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nSo I *informed* him >:)\n\nI brought up all the issues we'd had with the previous project.  I brought up that they had no professional GIS staff or support of any kind.  I brought up that AutoCAD is not GIS, and trying to shoehorn CAD personnel, procedures, and information into a GIS framework is a terrible idea and clearly did not work (**$CADGuy** quietly smiled at that).  I brought up that they were trying to tout an old GIS software suite that was scheduled to be retired as being \"*up with the times*.\"  I brought up that they had conflated GIS and GPS in the past, as evidenced by the people that had crafted the project addendum.  I also said that those same people seem not to have understood basic concepts about GIS such as schemas, data type requirements, or projections.  **$BigEngineer** started off trying to counter each point, but as I kept going his mouth started to hang.  It was clear that he didn't understand most of what I was saying.  And I didn't give him much time to interject.  I can be passionate when I want to be, particularly when it is something that I think is important.\n\nAt the end of it, I remember (mostly) what I said:\n\n>**$Me**: This isn't an issue of dedication or effort or anything like that.  You all have plenty of that.  This is an issue of lack of depth in this field.  In fact, there is so little depth here that I don't think you are able to fully appreciate it (something like that, I paraphrased Dunning-Krueger on this guy - he didn't get it).  If you take meaningful change on this - contract with a professional GIS firm, hire GIS personnel, become an Esri partner, something similar - then I might reconsider my position.  Until that happens, I'm sorry, we're going to have to go with other options for our GIS services.\n\n**$CADGuy** gave me a wry look and seemed to half-nod, as if to say \"*Yep, that's about right*.\"  All the other people in the office turned to **$BigEngineer**.  Some of them had half-smiles on their faces too.  **$BigEngineer** was still staring at me, sort of fishmouthed.  He didn't say anything for a while.  His face was hard to read.  I didn't know what was going on in his head.  Was he so pissed off that he couldn't think of anything to say?  Was he still processing all the stuff I'd said to him earlier?  Was he just so shellshocked to have someone tell him that he didn't know anything about a subject that he couldn't speak?  No idea.  In my mind, though, it seemed to me that the look itself was enraged confusion.  It was glorious.\n\nIn that moment, though, I actually felt a twang of fear - would calling the company out like this threaten my job?  After all, **$BigBoss** thought he'd nearly gotten fired for tangling with this same guy years ago.  But then I realized that everything I'd said was actually true (and I had the evidence to back it up), I'd never been unprofessional and outright insulted them, and they were on the city's sh!tlist anyways.\n\nA very awkward silence ensued, after which I said \"I think we're done here.  Thank you for stopping by.\"  After some perfunctory goodbyes, they all filed out of my office.\n\n**$EngCo** hasn't bothered the municipality about anything GIS-related since.  I was able to go with the company we'd been working with previously, and we've gotten a ton of good work out of them.  The whole concept of \"firm of record\" went away shortly after this as well.  The new administration of the city was tired of having all these backdoor deals in place.  They went on a spree to redefine or renegotiate every existing contract for the whole municipality.  **$EngCo** has had to compete against a number of other engineering companies for standing work ever since, and they've lost several bids.  And obviously, we haven't paid them for any further GIS work whatsoever.\n\nI've seen **$BigEngineer** at numerous local industry events since all this.  He has avoided me each time.  No big loss there.  And I will always have the image of his confused face gloriously seared into the back of my memory for the rest of eternity :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, everybody!

Here are the next tales from the municipality, which are actually three short stories.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, and a lot that comes from rumors, gossip, and other people.  However some things are relatively recent, so any inaccuracies are entirely on me.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.\n\nTL\/DR: Three Merrie and Delightsome Stories, right pleasant to relate in all goodly company of Joyance and Jollity.\n\nFor some context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional. This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale. However, for reference, all these stories take place at my job at a municipality in the American South. I'll have a Dramatis Personae for each part.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Story the First: Well that ain't too bad at all!**\n\n* **$Me**: Masterful erudite.  Also me.\n* **$Fiery**: Dispatcher of our work order system.  She's very awesome, nice to be around, but brooks very little BS.\n* **$SoftSpoken**: Very easy-going field ops leader.  He knows a tremendous amount about our utilities network, but is not tech-savvy at all.\n\nSo a couple of years back, I was asked to take a stab at digitizing the work order system that was being used by the utilities field operations team here at the municipality.  At the time, the system they were using consisted of carbon paper, phone calls, and several Excel worksheets that weren't related together.  There may have been elaborate voodoo rituals associated with it too, I can't be sure.  It was as atrocious as it sounds (we continued to use this system up until the end of 2021!)  I decided to use ArcGIS Online and Workforce as the basis for a new digital system.  Turns out it works great!  Anyways, after a lengthy dev cycle where we tested everything thoroughly (and had a healthy dose of input from **$Fiery**), we went live back in December 2021.  I expected at least one call from somebody on the rollout day telling me it didn't work, that they didn't want to use it, that it was stupid, etc., and I got one - from the person I least expected, **$SoftSpoken**.\n\n**$SoftSpoken** is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  His main talent is in knowing absolutely everything about the city's utilities network.  He's managed to leverage all that into a supervisory position on the field ops team, which I think is very well deserved.  Anyways, on the rollout day, however, he called **$Fiery** \"in a tizzy,\" as they say.  He was upset that our new digital system didn't appear to have a way for the folks that were working outside of normal business hours to log their work - he also thought it was a bad idea that we were getting rid of the paper contact forms entirely in favor of this system.  **$Fiery** asked me to come into her office to help talk to him.  I told him that all the crews would need to do is write down a note of where they'd been and get that info to one of the dispatchers.  They could fill out their information using the digital system once a dispatcher generated the work order.  I mean, this was pretty much how they took care of these things right now anyways.  They didn't take contact paper out with them in the field, after all!  After a couple of minutes of **$Me** and **$Fiery** arguing with him and seemingly not getting anywhere, **$SoftSpoken** uttered the only angry words I'd ever heard from him.\n\n>**$SoftSpoken** (clearly upset): Well y'all do whatever you want to. <click>\n\nI took a deep breath and shrugged my shoulders.  I was ready to just let this slide - after all, literally everyone in the rest of the department was actively using this system.  Eventually **$SoftSpoken** would have to get on board.  I'd rather not rock the boat and make him angrier.  But **$Fiery** was having none of that.  She pointed me towards the door and said for me to drive her over to the utilities compound; she needed to have some words with **$SoftSpoken**.  I knew better than to argue with her, so I simply nodded my head and said, \"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\nI then got to see **$Fiery** lay down the law in **$SoftSpoken**'s office over at the compound.  Several of the other backup dispatchers were there too - **$Fiery** always made sure to have a posse with her when she was \"talking some sense into people.\"  She didn't yell at **$SoftSpoken** or anything, but she was very firm in what she said.  She made it clear that she was tired of filling out the paper forms, having them be lost, and trying to manage all this through that god-awful Excel system.  Unless some kind of disaster struck the city, this was what we were using now.  At the end of it, **$SoftSpoken** seemed to concede **$Fiery**'s point but he still wasn't enthusiastic.\n\n>**$SoftSpoken**: Well, I still don't think this will work like you think it will.  I think we should use the paper forms for a bit longer.  Whatever y'all want to do.\n\nAs I was to discover later, it turns out that **$SoftSpoken** was just intimidated by the system itself.  He didn't think he could use it easily and wanted a backup just in case.  Honestly, I can understand that.\n\nAnyways, I returned with **$Fiery** in tow to city hall shortly thereafter and got back to work.  A few hours later, I got a call from her.  She wanted me to come to her office and she seemed to be very happy.  Confused, I got up and wandered over.  Sitting next to her at her desk was **$SoftSpoken**.  Both of them were looking at her screen.  As soon as they saw me, **$SoftSpoken** smiled and said:\n\n>**$SoftSpoken**: Y'know, $Fiery just showed me how to work one of them new work orders.  It ain't too bad at all!  Only took me a minute.  You think you can come over to my office and show me how to do this and set it up on my computer?\n\nI could not contain my laughter :D\n\nAnd yes, I set everything up on his computer and showed him how to work it.  **$SoftSpoken** is now one of the power users of the system and dispatches more work orders than any other member of management.  Nice to have things work out as planned, isn't it? :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Story the Second: The Radios.**\n\n* **$Me**: Masterful erudite.  Also me.\n* **$GreaterIT**: IT Director. Good guy, horribly overworked, I try to do all I can to make his life a little easier.\n* **$GoodRep**: First rep from our radio provider, good guy, answers all our questions correctly in a timely fashion.\n* **$BadRep**: Other rep from our radio provider, doesn't communicate and takes advantage of us.  See which one I like better?\n\nWhen I first arrived at the municipality, I was given a city vehicle that had a radio within it.  Apparently, back in the day before cellphones were ubiquitous, this was how the various departments communicated work to the crews out in the field.  The thing didn't work - it wasn't connected to anything and I never actually pressed any button on it.  However, it was pretty awesome to pull in behind jacka$$es that were speeding or being stupid on the road, then grab my CV handset and begin whispering sweet nothings into it.  It got a bunch of idiots to slow down :)\n\nAnyways, at one point, I was asked to see if I could try to locate the various radios owned by the Utilities Department and verify their status.  The city had a maintenance contract with a local radio provider, but it was increasingly looking like nothing had been done to maintain our equipment for a long, long time.  I tried calling our point of contact, **$BadRep**, but I never heard anything back.  As such, I reached out to **$GreaterIT** to see if he could help me.  He'd worked on radios used by other departments and knew the maintenance company well.\n\nYou may be asking - what the h3ll do radios have to do with GIS?  The answer is, of course, *absolutely nothing*.  I was basically drafted to help with any sort of technical question that anyone had in the Utilities Department.  GIS is technical, right?  Radios are technical, right?  iPads are technical, right?  Electrical panels are technical, right?  I got my fair share of dealing with all of this, I'm afraid.  However, I was mostly ok with it, since it took heat off of **$GreaterIT** who was already stretched to his limit.\n\nAnyways, for our current issue, **$GreaterIT** happened to have another contact in his back pocket - **$GoodRep**.  **$GoodRep** had worked with us extensively in setting up the radios for the police department.  He was a subcontractor of some sort, with his own company selling products from the same radio provider.  We'd never had a problem with him - in fact, **$GreaterIT** had specifically reached out to him when our previous support companies had fallen through.  He was based on a different city from our own that was actually quite far away, but my municipality had a standing contract with him since we valued his services so highly.\n\nWe immediately asked **$GoodRep** if he could shed some light on the radios that were currently being \"maintained\" by the radio provider.  From what I could see, we were paying thousands a year on a maintenance contract but I couldn't even tell what it involved.  Like the awesome contact he was, **$GoodRep** was able to find the original contract for us.  He also found a comprehensive list of all the radios that we were currently paying support for, and even found information about a radio base station located at city hall that I wasn't even aware existed.\n\nMe and **$GreaterIT** reviewed all the information and my mood immediately soured.  From what I could tell, **$BadRep** was supposed to have come out and inspected our equipment as part of the maintenance contract once per year.  For the past *eight years*, he hadn't done so.  We grabbed our waders and machetes and hiked up to the radio base station (hidden behind the garage at the top of the hill behind city hall).  Once there, we could see it hadn't been kept up in years - there was ruined equipment all over the place and dead vermin all throughout.  The station didn't appear operable in any way.  The list that **$GoodRep** had gotten us stated that we had about 30 pieces of equipment in use throughout the utilities department.  I sent out a request for everyone to deliver their radios to me so that I could see if they were still operable; I got 11 back.  No idea where the rest were.  All the ones I received were broken.  By every account, **$BadRep** had done literally nothing to support us for almost a decade and had been receiving thousands from us in the process.\n\nSo I requested that we cancel the contract in its entirety and just go with cellphones, as we'd been doing for the past many years without much issue.  Management agreed with me, so I reached out to **$BadRep** to cancel the contract.  He never got back to me about it.  I was tempted to just refuse payment on the next invoice, but I had an ace up my sleeve now - **$GoodRep**.  I reached out to him instead, asking if he could get the paperwork for the contract termination signed and returned back to us.  He did so!  On the day before the termination was to go into effect, I got a text (not a call or an email, a fscking text) from **$BadRep**.\n\n>**$BadRep**: Woah, I just received notice that you all are cancelling our contract with us.  Are you sure you want to do this?  If you want to renew services with us later on, you'll need to pay a setup fee once again!\n\nPlease note, I have translated from the misspelled abbreviated text-speak unleashed upon me.  I believe the first text was something like \"omg ru rly cancling\".  My response?\n\n>**$Me**: K.\n\nLOL.  I followed up later, basically saying we weren't interested in continuing radio support services with him, but I love that my immediate text back to this douche was \"K\".  And as you can imagine, we haven't given him a dime since. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Story the Third: The Infant in Administration.**\n\n* **$Me**: Masterful erudite.  Also me.\n* **$TheAssessor**: Assessor of a local county near my city.  In charge of GIS for that county.\n* **$MouthBreather**: Moronic county administrator of the same county.  Would be hard-pressed to know how to wipe his own a$$ without a pop-up book instructing him how.\n\nThis one depresses me, solely because I am baffled as to how an oxygen thief of this caliber could be placed in as high a position of authority as he is.  However, I have read many of your stories here on TFTS, and unfortunately I realize that not only is this possible, it is not even particularly surprising. \\*sadface\\*\n\nOne of the things I've attempted to do over the years is build connections with the other public jurisdictions that are near the municipality.  Since we are all dealing with GIS data that is largely in the public domain, nothing really prevents us from sharing this info between cities and counties - and it saves everybody time in the process.  I'm a big fan of open data.  Through the process, they get stuff from us and in return I get things that would be substantially harder to acquire without them.  Kind of like spreading herpes.\n\nAnyways, something that I've also done is make certain that this data sharing is covered by suitable legal agreements.  On the one hand, this makes sure that everyone knows the data may not be 100% accurate for everything it could possibly be used for (this has bitten me pretty hard in the past, see [this story](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/sivnc3\/the_agency_part_3_the_lawyer\/)).  On the other hand, I can also prevent the other entity from sharing our data with a third party without our consent.  After all, we don't want every jackoff out there to be able to see where the \"Self-Destruct\" button is for the wastewater treatment plant.  That would be so disgusting if it were a thing.  Lol.\n\nSo all this being the case, I reached out to a nearby county to see if we could partner with them.  We will hereby refer to it as **$County**.  My municipality actually has utility lines that extend into **$County** for a short distance, so an agreement with them made sense.  This particular county is fairly small, rural, and poor.  They don't have a great deal of GIS support either, with everything handled through their assessor's office and managed by **$TheAssessor**.  Once I got the appropriate contact info, I gave him a call.\n\n**$TheAssessor** was a very pleasant guy.  Despite not having a GIS-based job, he still had some experience with the software, so our conversations were very productive.  I sent him my data usage agreement and he sent me his.  I had the municipality's lawyer look over everything and make some edits; **$TheAssessor** liked the edits so much that he recommended his county alter their template to match!  Things were looking up.  We wound up with two agreements that both of our legal departments were happy with (joy and rapture!)  I got them signed by the city manager of my municipality.  All we needed now were signatures from **$County**'s administrator.\n\nLet me make y'all aware of one other important detail.  At the same time as I was getting this GIS data usage agreement set up, one of the officials in my municipality's utilities department was working on a major sewer contract with **$County**.  This was an immense contract worth millions of dollars annually.  It had been in the works for several years by this point.  Everything was in place for it to get started; from what the utilities folks told me, all they were waiting on was a signature from the person in charge of **$County**.\n\nFrom the same person that I was waiting on for my GIS data agreement.  **$MouthBreather**.\n\nI emailed everything off and then waited.  After about a month had passed, I contacted **$TheAssessor** again to figure out what was going on.  His response back to me was \"**$MouthBreather** is waiting on you all to take the next steps before we can move forward.  Everything is in your court.\"  I literally had no clue what the hell he was talking about.  We'd already checked all the agreements; my city manager had even signed them!  Literally all we were waiting on was for **$MouthBreather** to sign them and send them back!  I sent a follow-up asking **$TheAssessor** what was going on - everything had already *been* set up on our end.\n\nHe responded shortly thereafter saying that this was a major agreement and that **$MouthBreather** had indicated to him that they were waiting for further steps to come from the municipality.  Again, this didn't make sense to me.  However, at around the same time, I wound up speaking to some of the folks that were involved in this massive utility contract with **$County**.  They told me that they were ready to move forward, but **$County** kept insisting that they were waiting for further steps to come from us.\n\n*No, it couldn't be...* Did - did **$MouthBreather** think that my tiny GIS data agreement was the same as this massive, multi-million dollar sewer contract?  I sent an email off to **$TheAssessor** to try and clarify this.  After all, nobody could be that dumb, right?\n\n**$TheAssessor** confirmed with me that **$MouthBreather** said it was the same contract. \\*facepalm\\*\n\nI sent email after email to **$MouthBreather** and **$TheAssessor**, doing everything in my power to explain that these were two different things.  That mine had nothing to do with the sewer contract.  I sent some emails that had exacting details on the differences, and made sure to include the signed agreement documents as attachments.  It was all for naught.  *Every single time*, **$MouthBreather** responded in a manner consistent with him thinking this was the sewer contract.  Almost certainly, he wasn't actually reading the emails (the multi-syllable words were probably too big and management doesn't know how to read to start with).  But I wanted to know for certain.  So I asked **$TheAssessor** to set up a Teams meeting between us all.  This is how the conversation played out:\n\n>**$Me**: So we have asked that you sign the GIS data usage agreement between $County and the municipality.  This will allow me to begin sharing GIS data with you, and for me to receive GIS data in return.  Do you have any questions?  \n>  \n>**$MouthBreather**: We are still waiting on next steps from you.  You all need to sign the contract.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: This is not the sewer contract between our jurisdictions.  My agreement is a GIS data usage agreement.  It is entirely separate.  \n>  \n>**$MouthBreather**: Everything is in your court for this contract.  I can't sign anything until you've finalized your decisions and signed it in return.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: This is not the sewer contract!  Everything IS signed on these agreements.  One of them even came from you!  \n>  \n>**$MouthBreather**: I can't sign this until you've finalized your decisions and signed on your end.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: Again, this is not the sewer contract.  This is a GIS data usage agreement.  It is for us to share data between our jurisdictions.  This agreement and the sewer contract are two separate agreements.  Do you understand that?  \n>  \n>**$MouthBreather**: ...if you all with finalize everything on your end, then I can sign the contract.  Everything needs to be signed.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: The agreement is signed.  \n>  \n>**$MouthBreather**: The contract is signed?  \n>  \n>**$Me**: No, the GIS data usage agreement is signed.  \n>  \n>**$MouthBreather**: Well you still need to finalize everything.  This is a major decision.  The sewer contract needs to be finalized before I can sign anything.  The ball is in your court.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: (exasperated) This is not the sewer contract!!!\n\nOH MY GOD.  It was like playing a high-stakes game of \"Who's On First\"!  If I made the wrong move here, a multi-million dollar contract that had been in the works *FOR YEARS* could fall through solely due to the lack of comprehension by this human fungus.  Jesus Christ.  After going around in circles for several minutes, I eventually discerned that I simply could not get through to this guy.  He could not comprehend that these were two different things.  But I couldn't just back out now, either - if I said anything like \"don't worry about it,\" he could take it to mean the contract was cancelled!\n\nSo I did the only thing that any sane person would do.\n\nI surreptitiously moved my mouse up the Teams interface and clicked \"End.\"  I then immediately sent an email saying \"Whoops!  Looks like we had a server hiccup.\"  **$MouthBreather**, being a moron, bought it.  He responded later with \"Sure, we'll continue this conversation later.\"\n\nAs you can assume, we *didn't* continue the conversation later.  No one has reached out to **$MouthBreather** since.  We are waiting for him to either be fired for incompetence or drown by looking up in the shower with his mouth hanging open.  Either way, once he's gone, the city will be able to move forward with both of these things.  Alas, **$MouthBreather** is still in his position at **$County**, though.  After all, the most disgusting grease and oil always floats to the top of the water, doesn't it?  Lol.  But I'll hold out hope.  I've got friends at **$County** now; I'm sure they will let me know when something changes :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, folks! I'll have another story up tomorrow!

This was a total pain as we had to move everyone to temporary offices, move our servers into a temporary server room, remap our entire network creating a bunch of VLANs, and deal with the fact that our users were now scattered across the campus.  We actually purchased a bicycle on the remodel budget.\n\nThe project did not include any work in the basement of our old building so the contractor walled off some old lab space and installed an HVAC unit and ran in enough power to get us through the construction phase.  We had one fiber pair from this room to the basement network closet where the last \"old\" bit of fiber ran under a parking lot a nearby building that had was the \"hub\" for our part of campus.  \n\nDuring the planning for this project myself and my coworker had repeatedly warned that we'd have service interruptions during construction.  The contractor told us up front that several power outages would be required, including one week of the building being powered by a generator.   We made sure the basement network closet was outfitted with signs, in multiple languages, warning everyone to Leave It The F\\*\\*K alone.   \n\nMy coworker and I were provided with hard hats and safety vests (required anytime we had to visit our servers), and moved to temporary office in the building next door.  We developed a good relationship with the contractor's onsite supervisor and he was super helpful over the course of the project.\n\nThe building had a total of four floors, including the basement.  The first step was almost total demolition of the three floors above the basement on this fifty year old building.  I don't know how much copper was removed, fifty years of telephone cable, cat5 cable, and electrical wiring, it was a lot for sure, I hope it got recycled.  No work was done in the basement, which was fine with us since it minimized the threat of service disruptions.\n\nOne day I had to visit our server room for some reason, and as I was leaving I saw some guys doing demolition work in the basement.  I checked with supervisor, \"oh yeah, the project's been modified and we're adding some lab space in the basement\".  Are they going to be messing with the network closet?  Nope, nothing to do with that.  Networking will be done later, after we move back in.   I mentioned that I saw a guy working on a ladder pulling the old network and phone cabling out.  No problem, all the \"live\" network cables had been sprayed with yellow paint and the demo guys were instructed to leave that alone.\n\nOf course about 4:30 that afternoon we loose all connectivity to our servers.  Grumbling I grab my hard hat and vest and head over to see if I can find anyone to complain to.  As I'm walking around the construction fence to head into the building, a young guy sees me and asks if there's any problem.  His manner indicated that he was pretty sure something was wrong.  Yes, there is a problem, I explain.  He confesses to cutting some cables and fiber, \"but not yellow\".  \n\nAbout this time, the supervisor shows up and starts lecturing this poor guy while we walk into the building and find the severed fiber hanging down from the overhead.  I note, it is NOT painted yellow.  However it IS a different color than all the other cables.  But not yellow.  I wasn't really mad anyone, stuff happens.  As it turns out there were guys from the networking contractor working elsewhere in the building, they came down and got paid overtime to splice the fiber.  The contractor got to pay for this of course.\n\nNetwork was restored pretty quickly and I gently asked the supervisor if we could make sure the one live fiber connection in the basement got some yellow paint.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1672250266.0},{"title":"Multi mode is better than Single mode fiber, because Multiple options are good, duh!","author":"lincolnjkc","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zxb8c9\/multi_mode_is_better_than_single_mode_fiber\/","text":"I'm an odd duck (aren't we all) -- where in any given day\/project I might be designing\/implementing\/supporting installed AV\/automation, mid-scale broadcast\/streaming, or almost anything IT except end user compute... And one of my favorite things is translate between the groups. \n\nAnother thing I've learned in 17 years of doing this full time is most IT people have no real clue about anything AV\/broadcst-y but will usually admit it, AV people don't get broadcast (but usually aren't that dangerous) and really don't get IT (but will do some really stupid things if you don't watch them carefully), and full-time broadcast people scare me because they're going to get the show on the air regardless of how many things need to be gaff taped together in unholy ways... It may only work for an hour but it's going to work or that hour, damn it. And woe be to anything (or anyone) who gets in their way.  \n\nAnyway, currently working on a new construction project with a total budget in the neighborhood of US$200m with a lot of AV and a fair proportion of installed broadcast infrastructure. This is a client who has standardized on single mode fiber; I think last I counted they were using 4 strands of MM, *in total, across their HQ campus* for one odd legacy thing ...broadcast gear de facto wants SMF. We specified only SMF for broadcast ties; the RCDD for the data\/telecom side specified only SMF for all of the in-building and cross-campus fiber interconnects (nothing like having a ~400-strand ring available for your needs...) \n\nGet on a call that had far too many people on it -- general contractor, AV integrator\/installer's team, me, the client's construction rep, the client's CIO, etc. etc., etc. and the AV integrator's engineer on the call makes the declaration that it's \"strange\" that we're using \"antiquated\" fiber. When queried for more information, he expressed dismay that there was only single mode in the building and none of the \"better\" multi mode. The General Contractor queried for more information\n\n> **Questionable engineer**: Well, of course, single mode comes from the old days where you could only use fiber for a single purpose. On the other hand if you used multimode you can use the same fiber for multiple things so you need _less fiber_ when you use multimode. \n\n\nmy concentration is broken by a private Teams message from the CIO wondering if he's hallucinating or if this guy is for real. If it's a hallucination we're both experiencing it... My camera gets turned off to protect the innocent. \n\n> **Questionable engineer**: So we'd strongly recommend that you redesign to eliminate the single mode and use multimode; you could probably use half as many strands as are currently planned...\n\nMy desk now has a dent in it from the amount of head banging and thrashing I'm doing. Has he conflated DWDM\/CWDM with physical fiber types? (Can you even do CWDM on multimode? I've only seen\/done it on SMF... and I don't really want to find out).\n\nSomeone I don't recognize asks \"would that affect anything?\"\n\n> **Questionable engineer**: Not at all except for cutting the number of fibers you need!\n\nI check to make sure I'm muted before screaming into the void...because you know, transmission distances over MMF and SMF are so *identical* ^(Sarcasm: MMF is usable generally around 2000 feet\/600 meters; SMF can be measured in KM)... \n\nI see the CIO has unmuted himself...\n\n> **CIO**: Thank you for the suggestion. We would strongly prefer to stick with our standard. \n\n... and he has re-muted. I have calmed myself down to be coherent ...\n\n> **Me**: Yes; multimode has some significant limitations for our needs and most of the products on the broadcast side only support single mode fiber. Please pay careful attention to the requirements in the specification as far as cable types and infrastructure requirements are concerned. These details will be critical.\n\n> **Questionable engineer**: If you insist, but it's really a shame to be putting such an old technology in this new building. \n\n> **General Contractor**: I think the owner's preference is clear here.

Here is the next story from my job at the municipality.  In this one, we'll deal with our terrible database management software developer.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, and a lot that comes from rumors, gossip, and other people.  However some things are relatively recent, so any inaccuracies are entirely on me.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.\n\nTL\/DR: Administer the collar of obedience!\n\nFor some context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional. This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale. However, for reference, all these stories take place at my job at a municipality in the American South. Here is my Dramatis Personae for this part:\n\n* **$Me**: Masterful erudite.  Also me.\n* **$BillingDir**: The Director of Billing.  Very ambitious, a local fixture in my city, and has a few issues, but I'm actually pretty good friends with her.\n* **$OldCM**: The old city manager.  She was pretty awesome and did a lot of good, but had to navigate through the miasma of \"good-ole-boy-ism\" pervasive at the time.\n* **$StupidWorks**: The administrative database software that my municipality uses.  Extremely basic and often quite terrible.\n* **$LowestBidder**: The software development company that created $StupidWorks.  Filled to the brim with salespeople that oversell and developers that don't know what they're doing.\n* **$LadyRep**: Sales representative from $LowestBidder.  She didn't know what she was talking about most of the time.\n* **$LeadDev**: Lead software developer for a project we wanted.  Kind of an a$$hole.\n\nAs we begin, I think it's pertinent to give some background for this story.  Many local governments in the United States have begun using administrative management software that allows them to better handle day-to-day operations.  These suites are some of the core elements behind the \"Smart Cities\" initiative.  They allow all aspects of the city to be digitized and managed through a relational database management system (RDBMS).  When an ornery resident comes into the office in nothing but a shower cap and towel yelling that she \"can't wash her a$$,\" this software allow the traumatized billing staff look up her account info without having to wade through ream after ream of dead trees (true story).  It also allows incidents to be related to one another, such as the opening of a police investigation about a sudden loss of funds in a particular department's budget and an HR ticket regarding \"irregularities in pay\" for a certain staff member (also true story).  When managed well, these software programs are a game changer for local government, letting things be run quicker and more effectively, with fewer staff, with better documentation and more transparency to the public.  Many suites are very well-designed; I would consider CityWorks to be among them.\n\nUnfortunately for us, our administrative database software was designed by **$LowestBidder**.\n\n**$OldCM** was the agent of change for all this.  Around 2013, she felt that it was now time to move the city's operations forward from the procedures that had been in place since the 1980s.  We needed to venture forth into the digital age and commit our records and operations to these new-fangled \"com-puters\".  She pitched her ideas to the City Council.  They were quite enthusiastic about it.  They were less enthusiastic about the price, and in true political fashion, were only willing to spend a fraction of the amount requested.  As a result, our bid for this new system went to the cheapest option.\n\n*You get what you pay for.*\n\n**$StupidWorks** was then purchased and implemented at the city.  On the whole, it is actually built around a reasonably-reliable database engine.  It just has problems with everything else.  Like a Corvette with an immaculately-maintained engine - and that also has four flat tires, a rusting chassis, spider-line fractures on all the windows, and a dead mouse somewhere inside it.  Let me give you some examples:\n\n* Support for the thing is atrocious.  We've had dozens of \"emergency patches\" to fix problems implemented by regular updates.  I can't tell you the number of emails I've gotten saying \"Please log out of **$StupidWorks** so we can fix something.\"  I don't believe we've ever transitioned to a new fiscal year without problems.\n* The core servers have gone down multiple times - thank God that **$GreaterIT** has a really awesome backup solution in place for us.  Probably a quarter of his already-stretched time and effort is spent supporting this software alone.\n* I don't know what the f\\*ck is up with the database designers.  Trying to add tangential BS is incredibly easy - if I went tomorrow and asked \"Could you add a flag field indicating whether there are pink flamingos on a property's yard\" the designers would have it done in an hour.  But core functionality?  *NOPE*.  I've been requested that they add in City\/State\/ZIP location fields ever since I started.  They still haven't done it, and continually push back when I ask.\n* Their project managers are some of the most incompetent morons I've ever seen.  We had a particular part of their suite that our staff was testing to see if it worked correctly.  They loaded test data into that system.  **$LowestBidder** *knew* that this was test data.  The report needed from this process was extremely important and had legal implications for the city - *hence the testing*.  One day, the project managers in charge of this process just decided to publish this report - using the test data when they did so!  They didn't ask anyone, they weren't given a directive, and they didn't check to see what was in the database.  The only way our staff even found out was because a user sent an email saying \"Thanks for getting me the report!\"  We had to backtrack everything, make sure that people didn't use the report, and quickly derive the correct data for this d@mned thing!  This put us in a world of trouble.  **$LowestBidder**, if any of you know who I am and are reading this, the city will probably drop your software specifically because of this incident >:(\n\nGrrr.\n\nAnyways, once I was brought on board, **$LowestBidder** started doing a fantastic job - of cultivating my piss-poor perception of them and their product.  I've already told you about them consistently ignoring my pleas for added core functionality.  Something else hit a little closer to home.  I could tell right from the get-go that **$StupidWorks** had not been created as a geographically-enabled database system.  To give some perspective, I mentioned above that most local governments are moving towards software suites like this to manage their operations.  What I didn't mention is that almost all of those suites utilize GIS as the backend - GIS can be used as a relational database management system, and by enabling geographic positioning you are able to manage things not just through attributes but through location as well.  When I first arrived at the municipality, I actually didn't even realize there were suites like this without a geographic component!\n\n**$StupidWorks**, unfortunately, has no GIS-based back-end at all.  There are fields available for coordinates within many records of the database, but they are \"optional.\"  Within the interface, there are often buttons that say \"Open Map\" associated with particular entries.  When you click one, it opens to a Google Maps API; if there are coordinates programmed into the system, it will zoom down on them, but in most instances there is no data so it just opens to a general map of the city (or focuses on city hall).  Astonishingly useful.  I spoke to one of the reps and asked her how to fix this.  Remember how I said above that the company was rife with salespeople that oversell?  I asked if I could link database entries in **$StupidWorks** with some of the assets I'd uploaded into ArcGIS Online.  Our conversation went something like this:\n\n>**$LadyRep**: Sure!  That would be easy to do.  We absolutely can do that.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: Ok, well our GIS assets are only shared internally.  You have to log in to access them.  How does this system actually access AGOL then?  Will I need to set up a generic account, or can the users log in individually?  And would those credentials have to be hardcoded?  Do I need to to have Enterprise and manage a REST service instead?  \n>  \n>**$LadyRep**: Well, I'm not really certain how it would work, our tech people would have to work out all the details, but I know we can do it!  \n>  \n>**$Me**: Wait a minute.  You just told me that you \"absolutely\" could do this - yet you have no idea how it would actually happen?  \n>  \n>**$LadyRep**: Well...  \n>  \n>**$Me**: ...Have you ever seen an Esri integration with your product?  \n>  \n>**$LadyRep**: ...  \n>  \n>**$Me** (wry look): Yep, that sounds about right.\n\nAs you can imagine, I put absolutely zero stock in what she said to me.  The company has repeated this countless times in the intervening years and I still refuse to believe it.\n\nAnyways, let's get to the crux of the matter.  A few years after I started at the municipality, **$BillingDir** approached me about a project that she had requested of **$LowestBidder**.  She wanted them to add and populate a field showing the Tax Map Numbers for all of the customer accounts we had in our system, and amazingly **$LowestBidder** had said they could do this!  Just to point out, a Tax Map Number is like the unique identifier for a piece of land (usually called a \"parcel\", another term is \"Parcel Identifier\").  Having that number is basically a guarantee that you can locate the property that it is associated with.  **$BillingDir** was overjoyed since we could use this Tax Map Number as a proxy to try and identify the actual locations of all our customers.  She wanted me to help out with the logistics of this and to get an updated parcels dataset to the developers.\n\nI was initially quite surprised about this and happy to hear it.  If the development company could populate this data for all our accounts, it would save me a tremendous amount of hassle trying to locate things in the future.  After all, the entries in the database did not have a City, State, and ZIP Code associated with their street address locations, and this made it virtually impossible to geocode things accurately.  I had been resigned to doing this manually in the future.  Knowing how much work it would be to do this by hand, I assumed that such a project would take a long time and cost us a lot of money.  So I asked - when was the completion date on this and how much were we paying for it?\n\n**$BillingDir** proudly responded that they could have the work done in a month and that it would cost <X> amount (which, while many thousands of dollars, still did not seem nearly high enough).\n\nAlarm bells immediately went off in my head.  I knew that populating these Tax Map Numbers would be a predominantly manual process, and while the amount quoted was still very high, it was less than the total number of customer accounts that I knew we had.  Something was off.  I asked **$BillingDir** if this was actually the amount quoted to populate this data or if it was for something else.  **$BillingDir** shook her head, adamant that this represented the amount to populate those fields.  I asked her if I could see the scope of work.\n\nWe went over to her office to review the project.  After looking at the documents, what I could see was that **$LowestBidder** was agreeing to add a Tax Map Number *FIELD* to each of our customer accounts, and that they were going to add in a new flat file within the database system to hold information on parcels (using the Tax Map Number as the keyfield), but there was nothing in there that actually said they were going to populate this new field for us.  I made **$BillingDir** aware of this.  She got frosty with me:\n\n>**$BillingDir**: The reps assured me that with this project, we would have Tax Map Numbers for all of our accounts!  \n>  \n>**$Me**: Yes, but I don't think that means what you think it means.  I think all they were promising is that they'd add a new field that would be tied to the parcels data I'd provide to you, and we (the city) would have to actually fill out all this information for the individual accounts over time.  \n>  \n>**$BillingDir** (angrily): Well that is not the way the reps explained this to me.  You should be on my next call with them so that we can clear all of this up.\n\nI agreed to that.  I reviewed the information that **$BillingDir** had from the software company just to make sure what I had said was right, and it appeared to be.  I reached out to **$LowestBidder** before the call to get some clarification, but they refused to tell me anything definitive over email.  I also spoke with **$BillingDir** about the implications here, as well - if what I said was right, then the development company was requesting that we spend thousands on what was, essentially, a trivial amount of work, something that I could do in ArcGIS Online in like an hour or so.  She assured me that the original explanation was correct and that everything would be cleared up on the call.\n\nA few weeks later, we had the call.  It was **$Me**, **$BillingDir**, **$LadyRep**, **$LeadDev**, and a few others.  **$LadyRep** went on for a little while about what the project was, what it would provide us, what they would do, and then asked for any questions.  I went straight in for the kill:\n\n>**$Me**: Yes, I have only one real question.  It was $BillingDir's understanding that this project would populate Tax Map Number information for all of our accounts.  Does the amount you quoted us include that data entry or does it not?  \n>  \n>**$LadyRep**: Well, the project will allow each account to be associated with a Tax Map Number, and those numbers will be tied to the data within an internal table that you provide us.  So yes, each account will have Tax Map information.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: That's not what I asked.  Will you be populating these fields for us, or will you not?  \n>  \n>**$LadyRep** (hesitantly): ...I'm not really sure, $LeadDev, could you shed some light on this?  \n>  \n>**$LeadDev** (in an impatient and irritated voice): No, we will not be doing your data entry for you.  This will be to set up the architecture only.  All other work is to be handled by your agency.  \n>  \n>**$Me** (looking over to $BillingDir, who is sitting listening with her jaw agape): I wanted to confirm that.  So you're saying you will not be populating this field for us?  \n>  \n>**$LeadDev** (very shortly): No.  \n>  \n>**$Me**: That's all I wanted to know.\n\nThat pretty much sealed the deal.  I spoke to **$BillingDir** later, who was quite upset that **$LowestBidder** had misrepresented\/lied to her about this project as they had.  I asked her if she really wanted to move forward with this, to which she answered \"No.\"  She actually said something very different but I have Bowdlerized it to this :)  A couple of weeks later, an email came in from the developers asking if we wanted to move forward with the project.  After speaking once more with **$BillingDir**, she asked me if I would be willing to do the honors.\n\nWith a grin like the Cheshire Cat, I said \"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n>Dear **$LowestBidder**;  \n>  \n>After reviewing everything with all interested stakeholders here at <municipality>, we do not feel that any further work on this project would be in the best interests of the city.  Please terminate this project at your earliest convenience.  Thank you.  \n>  \n>\\- **$Me**\n\nAnd that's how I saved my municipality many thousands of dollars on a useless addition to our admin database (which I wound up creating within our AGOL organization a few weeks later anyways).  You get what you pay for, after all - and in this case, I'm glad we paid for (and received) *absolutely nothing*! :D\n\nThanks for reading, folks!  I'll have another story up tomorrow!

Our department had been trying to set up our own student computer lab for a while, but budget and space requirements had forced postponements over and over.  Finally we managed to nail down enough funds to pay for the remodeling of some office space into a computer lab and to furnish the new lab with desks and computers.  \n\nWe weren't too far into the planning process when the problem of student access came up.  University policy was to secure most buildings from 7PM to 7AM, Monday through Friday, plus weekends.  This meant a person needed a physical key to enter, which would problematic to say the least.  We allowed graduate students to get keys if they needed access to assist with research, but it required them to pay a deposit and several levels of faculty approval using various forms, which was a total pain.   Students were supposed to turn in keys when they left to get their deposit back, but often they skipped this step so the number of \"missing keys\" grew over time.   Providing access for our entire student group would require hundreds of keys, instead of the 10-15 we managed for grad students.\n\nI talked to a co worker in another building about how they managed student access and he told me that his department had to have their entire building re-keyed by the University locksmiths a couple of years prior due to the high number of lost keys, and it had cost $50,000.   It was clear we needed a key card system as a solution.\n\nI asked around and found there were a couple of departments using standalone systems since up to this point there was no University standard for key cards, departments had just decided to find a solution and bought one.  One of the departments had a scalable solution, if we bought the same system we could piggy back off their server, which would remove our need to admin another service, we'd just have to update the database for our users, which was fairly easy.\n\nMy co-sysadmin, J, and I called the vendor and one of the sales force was out to see us within days.  We walked our building showing which doors would need to accessed, what groups we needed managed, which server needed to host our users, and basically we found our project was pretty small from the vendor's point of view.  They were used to doing entire buildings or groups of buildings, so our situation was no problem.\n\nWe got a quote for the entire project within another couple of days and went through the hoops of getting a purchase order.  We were really on fire to get this going as it was the final step in setting up our new student computer lab.  The University purchasing folks mailed the PO to the vendor, and I faxed over a copy (yes this was Quite A While Ago).  The sales guy confirmed they got the PO and I asked when the work could be scheduled. \n\nAt this point I discovered I made a pretty big mistake.   I should have included a \"work to completed by some\\_date\".  The sales guy informed me that scheduling was under control of the company owner, David.  OK, can I talk to David?  He's out of office, we'll take a message.  I left a message and heard nothing for next few days.  I called again, David was not in the office, would I like to leave to a message?  This went on for a couple of weeks, with everyone getting more and more pissed off.  The remodeling work was done on our lab and we were getting furniture installed.  The computers had been delivered and we were almost ready to go live.\n\nMy coworker J suggested we cancel the PO with David's company and go back to square one.  I wasn't sure how this worked so I checked with Purchasing and they said this was pretty easy.  I really didn't want to start over but J and I checked with the folks involved on our end and they agreed that while it would be a pain, it was okay with them to cancel.\n\nSo, J called David's company, no still not in, so J just left a message that if we didn't get a date for the project to be completed by EOB the PO would be cancelled.   \n\nJ's phone rang about 10 minutes later.  David was on the line, apologizing, \"things were busy\", he didn't realize we were in a hurry, blah, blah, blah.   All the BS that folks hand out when they're being phone as hell.  He told us the work could be done the following week, his main installation guy would be in touch, so sorry, here's my cell phone number so you can call me directly. \n\nA team of installation techs showed up the following week had everything done in three days.  We had some further issues since we found out our University ID cards were not compatible with the card readers on the new system so we had to buy our own cards, but it turned out to be pretty cheap.\n\nWe had other departments come to us for advice about adding this service over the next couple of years and you can bet we told them to make sure they got a completion date as part of the sales agreement.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1672083513.0},{"title":"The Municipality: Part 1 - The Plotter","author":"Mr_Cartographer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zvn6e9\/the_municipality_part_1_the_plotter\/","text":"Hello y'all!  Sorry for the long delay - it has been a very busy past year!  I was asked to keep providing more stories, so here are several from my job at the municipality.  Hopefully these will fall a little closer to the IT and tech support side of things.  This first one regards the plotter \\*shudder\\*.  I hope that you all enjoy!  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, and a lot that comes from rumors, gossip, and other people.  However some things are relatively recent, so any inaccuracies are entirely on me.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.\n\nTL\/DR: Honor.  Valor.  Buttor.\n\nFor some context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional. This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale. However, for reference, all these stories take place at my job at a municipality in the American South. Here is my Dramatis Personae for this part:\n\n* **$Me**: Masterful erudite.  Also me.\n* **$LesserIT\/$GreaterIT**: One of the IT guys, eventually becomes the IT Director. Good guy, horribly overworked, I try to do all I can to make his life a little easier.\n* **$ElderIT**: The old IT Director.  Originally brought in as a contractor, had a pretty laissez-faire approach to the work.\n* **$OldCM**: The old city manager.  She was pretty awesome and did a lot of good, but had to navigate through the miasma of \"good-ole-boy-ism\" pervasive at the time.\n* **$BigBoss**: The boss of the division I work at.  Very chill, easy-going, but likes things to work.\n* **$LazyCo**: The piece of crap company where we purchased our first plotter and that \"maintained\" it afterwards.\n* **$SmarmyIT**: Annoying IT tech consistently dispatched by $LazyCo to \"fix\" our problems.  I did not like him, if you can't tell.\n\nEnough stalling.  To the tale!\n\nFor those of you that don't know, a plotter is a massive printer that is used to print out poster-sized documents.  It can be used to print maps, engineering drawings, images, advertisements and notifications, movie posters, and enormous copies of buttcheeks sent over from the scanner.  I've used plotters throughout the entirety of my career in GIS.  After all, even though we are in the digital age of dynamic webmaps, people still need their giant poster-sized prints showing them just exactly where the restrooms are in the food court.\n\nI am... not fond of plotters.  To me, they are finicky, take a long time to warm up, require specialized care and resources, don't work half the time (and won't tell you why they won't work), and so on.  I have spent hours upon hours fiddling with these infernal machines trying to get them to operate.\n\nA relevant passage from the Book of Oatmeal goes as follows:\n\n>And lo, the Gods of IT looked down upon the milling throngs of tech support and didst proclaim, \"Thy job is not hard enough.\"  And, in their mirth, they unleashed upon the world the *PRINTER*, to confound humankind to the end of its days.\n\nOur story begins many years before I was hired at the municipality.  One fine morning about eight years ago, **$OldCM** awoke and declared that she needed a very nice plotter\/scanner combo for the city.  There were a couple of reasons for this, but the main one was simply because we had no large-scale printing capacity in-house at the time.  If anything big needed to be printed, we had to reach out to a company named **$LazyCo** so they could do it (which usually took forever, btw).  Rather than move through this sort of middleman (and to prevent the ungodly lag time), **$OldCM** wanted us to have this capability onsite.  In addition, she also wanted us to be able to scan the thousands and thousands of veritable Dead Sea Scroll-like maps and documents that were stuffed in every available closet in city hall.  So, once getting to the office, she summoned **$BigBoss**, told him about her idea, and said \"You get to buy this.\"  **$BigBoss** wasn't particularly thrilled at that.  But seeing as how he had the biggest budget at the municipality, it made sense.\n\n**$BigBoss** is nothing close to technology-savvy, so his first instinct was to reach out to our existing provider for some options.  **$LazyCo** apparently didn't want to lose some of our sweet, sugary, saccarine-laden business, so once contacted they informed us that they could \"*provide us with everything we needed*.\"  They'd be able to sell us a combo system and would even have an annual maintenance package for us.  Sounds pretty cool, right?\n\n*Lol*.  Let's get started, shall we?\n\nThe system that **$LazyCo** sold to us was about six years old when we purchased it.  They sold it to us for about twice what it should have cost - their price conflated that of a brand-new plotter system with one that was relatively old (but still in support).  **$BigBoss** was furious when, years later, I discovered this and pointed it out to him.  Anyways, the leadership at the municipality didn't have a whole lot of expertise in these matters, so they just tossed it up as a cost of doing business and paid for everything.  The system came with a maintenance contract as well that we'd have to pay for three years - after that, we'd have to renew it (and keep paying, of course).\n\nSpeaking of expertise, let's talk about the IT setup at the municipality at the time.  During those halcyon days, **$ElderIT** was in charge of everything IT-related.  **$LesserIT** was on-staff but he wasn't really an IT professional.  He worked in an another department and just happened to know more than the average bear regarding tech.  **$ElderIT** was the one actually in charge of our entire IT architecture, but he wasn't even a full-time employee.  He was a contractor.  He only worked two days per week here in the office.  Depending on whether he felt like it or not, he'd just not show up.  He'd take epic trips all across the world for months at a time.  Let this situation sink in, folks.  We basically had a flippant part-timer doing all the IT work for the entirety of the municipality with a little ad-hoc help here and there.  This was the situation for our entire municipality, with its tens of thousands of residents and customers.  This was not in the before-times when computers were shiny mystical objects that weren't a requirement for every desk.  This was in 2014, eight years ago.  Jesus.\n\nAnyways, as can be assumed, **$ElderIT**'s approach to the job was extremely cavalier.  I remember that he was a nice enough guy and he had a decent grasp on most things, but it was also clear that he was just riding along until he could retire.  He had remarkably few f\\*cks to give.  He wasn't big on learning or implementing new stuff, either.  And the fact that he was a contractor made him pretty loose with his responsibilities.  The situation we'd found ourselves in was no different.  When **$ElderIT** returned to work after being gone for some time and was told that **$OldCM** had purchased a plotter, his direct response was as follows:\n\n>**$ElderIT**: I didn't buy that thing.  You didn't ask for my input, so I won't support it.\n\nThat was it, end of story.  **$ElderIT** made it very clear that since we had purchased a maintenance contract with **$LazyCo**, we should contact them for all plotter-related issues, not him.  He would not be doing any work on this plotter whatsoever.  And while a lot of this makes sense (how many of you have had a department buy something without your knowledge and then demand you support it?), the city was in a pretty big bind here.  **$ElderIT** hadn't been available any time they wanted to talk about purchasing the plotter to begin with, after all.  Most often, he was gone for weeks and \"out of contact.\"  He also refused to be available for most of the setup required, as well - y'know, things like getting the plotter connected to the network and making sure that users across the enterprise could see it through the print server.  **$LesserIT** had to be the one to do every bit of this since the actual IT support for the city couldn't be a$$ed.  Seriously, **$ElderIT**'s attitude throughout all of this could not have dripped more of entitlement.\n\nAnyways, back to the plotter.  The municipality had ordered this new devilry and absolutely everything about it was a clusterf\\*ck from the very beginning.  We were given a delivery date (like four months after we ordered it, **$LazyCo** took their sweet time).  **$BigBoss** and his crew waited patiently on the prescribed date for it to arrive.  They waited... and waited... *and waited*.  During the course of the day, nobody knew where the plotter was.  We probably had delivery tracking but no one knew how to use it.  At the end of the day, a bedraggled deliveryman stumbled into city hall.  He said that he'd tried to call (spoiler alert: he didn't) but couldn't reach anyone.  On the way over, he'd gotten into a serious accident.  Our new plotter was now a twisted pile of scrap on the streets of the nearby capital city.  Sounds about right.\n\nThe municipality then waited another four months for a replacement to be ordered and shipped.  **$LazyCo** never bothered to inform the city when it would arrive, so one day it just showed up out of the blue when nobody was expecting it.  Few people were even in the office, and **$ElderIT** was on a month-long visit to Brazil.  Literally the only person that had understanding of what to do in this situation was **$LesserIT**.  He was completely blindsided.  He made his way up to city hall to help connect this monster of a machine.  *And what a monster it proved to be*.\n\nThe system was designed in two parts - a stand-alone plotter and a separate scanner.  However, the software and drivers would not operate unless both devices were turned on and active.  Apparently this was so that people \"wouldn't just use one part and not the other.\"  And if something happened to make one part inoperable?  Well, the whole system would go down.  Say the plotter ran out of magenta ink and could no longer print.  Sorry, the scanner is now disabled, because the printer needs to be operable as well.  What happens if the scanner goes to sleep?  Sorry, the printer is now disabled - because the scanner needs to be operable too!  Ugh.\n\nIt was so much worse.  The system was controlled by a passthrough tower that was connected to the city's network.  This thing was literally ancient - it had a *PENTIUM* sticker on the front!  Remember - 2014!  WTF!  I have a picture, I'll post it in the comments :)  When **$LesserIT** protested this archaic hardware being placed on the network, he was told by **$LazyCo**'s reps that \"It's ok, it's just controlling the plotter and scanner, it doesn't need performance!\"  The system drivers could not work in anything newer than Windows 7.  The machine had a touch-screen monitor for \"nuanced control\" - the input delay was so bad that you'd have to wait up to a minute or longer before it would register that you even touched the d@mned thing!\n\nThis was the status of the monstrosity delivered to my municipality on that day.  For many long years, that's what they had to work with.  The system was rarely used for anything beyond scans of documents, and even then most of them had to be rescanned (because the scanner didn't have guiderails to hold the paper straight).  In the intervening time, most people that knew anything about the plotter either retired, left, or forgot.  The end of our service agreement came and went.  **$LazyCo** never reached back out to us to renew it.  When I arrived at the city, this mess had been gathering dust for almost a year.\n\nEnter **$Me**.  Almost four years after the plotter\/scanner combo was purchased, I accepted the job as the GIS Analyst for the municipality.  One of my first tasks (given to me by **$BigBoss**) was to get this machine functional again and get the maintenance contract renewed.  I had literally no experience with this sort of thing (always inspires confidence, doesn't it?)  However, I tried my best.  I reached out to **$LazyCo** to see if they would give us a new contract.  They said they would, all that was needed was for them to send a tech out to check the machine to make sure it worked.  It took them *a year and half* to send someone.  In the meantime, they had us resume payments once again on the same terms as the old contract we'd had in the past.  They started sending us invoices shortly thereafter.  I was still very new to this when it started, so I didn't realize that we could have just refused because there wasn't an active contract in place.  But I did my best to make sure that everything got paid - which was almost f\\*cking impossible.  **$LazyCo** got *everything* wrong.  They would send invoices by mail to the wrong people.  They misspelled my name and **$BigBoss**'s name.  I would ask them to send me the invoices directly, they'd promise that they would do so over the phone, and the next invoices would invariably be sent to the wrong person!  Some invoices were sent by mail, others by email, others by fax.  Some went to completely different departments at the city.  Some they just forgot to send!  Seriously, for over a year, I would have random people come up to me with a letter from these morons saying \"Is this for you?\"\n\nEventually, they did send someone to check on the machine we had.  Alas, we must now introduce **$SmarmyIT**.  The very first thing he told me as he walked in and looked at the plotter was \"Oh, we don't support that anymore.\"  *WHAT!?!*  These idiots knew exactly what model of machine we had - they knew this before even sending a tech!  I had told them multiple times.  From what **$SmarmyIT** said, they'd stopped supporting this model a year beforehand - *and we'd been paying them for a maintenance contract on it ever since!!!*\n\nI was very upset during **$SmarmyIT**'s site visit.  I'm certain that his attitude didn't help things.  I kept asking questions about the operation of the machine, and he was very dismissive of each one.  Things like how to put guiderails on the sides of the scanner.  \"You don't need guiderails, you kin jest rotate the image!\"  That doesn't restore the parts of the image we lost, jacka$$, and the result looks janky as f\\*ck!  I also asked about the issues with how long it was taking to print from the server, which we'd eventually find out was due to the ancient passthrough machine dying.  \"Oh its jest an old system, give'r a minute and she'll be fine!\"  Imagine everything he said in the most annoying, nasal, highland-Southern accent you can think of, and that was this guy.\n\nThe biggest vote of confidence towards the company came at the end of the site visit, though.  As he was packing up to leave, **$SmarmyIT** popped up with this gem, \"Y'know, this system's gettin' pretty old.  Y'all will be needin' to update it soon, so whenever you're ready, jest reach out to us agin!\"  I remember just shaking my head.  *Yeah, I'll do that \/s*.  In the meantime, they promised that they could still service the plotter for a few more years on a time-and-effort basis.\n\nUgh.\n\nAs can be imagined, this technological abortion continued to deteriorate.  Remember how I said that **$ElderIT** couldn't be f\\*cked to do anything about this system?  Well, he decided to go ahead and update the passthrough machine to Windows 10 - because of, y'know, EOL on Windows 7 - without telling anybody or testing anything.  Somehow, the drivers and software on the machine continued to work.  But there were major issues now.  The processing speed slowed to an absolute crawl.  If I attempted to send any documents to print that were bigger than about 1 MB, the spooler would spin up to about 2 GB, hang, and then the computer would crash.  We attempted to install the drivers and software on other spare machines here at city hall, and each one patently refused to work.  The only system where things seemed to work was this ancient relic.  Eventually, the passthrough stopped responding to the network at all - print documents seemed to be getting lost on the way, and none of our scans were saving to the network.  You all would likely know what was going on better than me.  From what I could see, however, it looked to be a progressive failure of the controlling machine.\n\nI called **$SmarmyIT** for a service call after that.  We opened up the passthrough to find that the thermal paste had almost entirely deteriorated between the heat sink and the CPU.  The system also only had 2 Gb of DDR3 RAM in it.  **$SmarmyIT** put two more memory sticks in it from his truck.  I asked if we could get a new passthrough machine instead of this memorial to the heydays of Alanis Morisette (I have since learned that the machine may not have been as old as I thought - thanks u\/TheThiefMaster!).  **$SmarmyIT** assured me, \"Sure!  I got one back at the office.  We'll git it to ya soon as we kin!\"\n\nYeah, they never got us a new machine.\n\nIncredibly, things kept getting worse and worse.  I began to petition my bosses for a replacement for this d@mnable thing.  By this point, parts were becoming an issue.  We couldn't order new ink or cartridges from the company anymore; everything had to come through second-hand suppliers.  If anything broke, we had issues finding replacements.  **$ElderIT** had thankfully retired by this point, leaving a newly-minted **$GreaterIT** in charge, but even he didn't know how to fix all the issues that would crop up from time to time.\n\nWe had one major breakdown occur during this period as well.  I needed new rolls of paper and requested them from one of our admin staff.  The person that ordered our supplies didn't really know what to order, so he bought paper where the central roll was actually too big for the axles we had in the plotter.  Unbeknownst to me, another coworker then loaded this paper into the device.  I never noticed because the plotter seemed to work fine this way for quite some time.  However, towards the end of the month, I noticed a bunch of skipped lines on one of the maps I printed.  Since this was a pretty nasty problem, I called **$SmarmyIT** to come out and look at it.\n\nHe looked at the roll and said we had the wrong size of paper loaded into it.  I told him that it had been working fine up till that point.  He then proceeded to pull out a roll adjuster (a little mechanism that can increase the size of an axle so that paper with a different sized central roll can be fitted to it) and said that we needed some of these.  I'd never seen one or used one until that point, and I pointed that out to him.  He then proceeded with this gem, \"Now that's whut I like t'call USER ERROR!\"  Seriously, *f\\*ck you guy*.\n\nEventually, though, this thing wound up being beyond its absolute last legs.  We had one working axle left.  The touchscreen monitor had died; we had an old flatscreen that I was using instead.  I'd gotten some roll adjusters and purchased a decent supply of ink, but I didn't know how long this would last.  The passthrough machine was slowly dying.  I'd requested a replacement plotter system in the city budget for the previous three years; it had been struck each time.  After all, what we had was still working, right? \\*facepalm\\*  In the meantime, the only way I could get the d@mn thing to work was to copy documents I wanted to print to a flash drive, load them on the passthrough machine, and print from there.  Similarly, I would copy scans from the passthrough onto that flash drive and then take them back to my desk to load to the network.\n\nThe stage was set for a breakdown from which there could be no return.\n\nThat breakdown happened at the beginning of this year.  I was printing some things for **$BigBoss** and noticed a bunch of blurred lines on the prints.  I thought it was just an ink issue, so I replaced some of the cartridges and reprinted; everything seemed to work.  On the very next print, an error popped up.  After investigating everything thoroughly and doing all the troubleshooting that I could, it appeared to be a print head problem.  We needed to replace the heads.  I still wasn't entirely sure of everything, so I submitted a request to **$LazyCo** once more to send **$SmarmyIT** out to look at the thing.  He came out and confirmed that the heads were dead.  He quoted us a price of about $1,500 for the replacements; I looked everything up online and saw that I could get them for about $700.\n\nBut I was done with this piece of sh!t.\n\nI spoke to **$BigBoss** and asked - did we really want to keep throwing money at this thing?  The past several years, we'd wasted thousands on a useless maintenance contract, spent additional thousands on time-and-effort calls, and spent a premium on printing supplies and repair parts from second-hand suppliers.  Did we really want to spend close to a thousand dollars just to get this thing limping along for a few more months until the next breakdown?  Where do we cut our losses?\n\n**$BigBoss** agreed with me.  There's a reason I've always liked working for him :)  Out with the old, in with the new!\n\n**$BigBoss** got confirmation that we could purchase a new plotter\/scanner combo with funds leftover in the present year's budget.  After all, my request for next year was cut.  But it seems that once each year's annual budget is passed by the council, nobody gives two sh!ts how it actually gets spent.  Seems legit.  Since we had some funds leftover this year (thanks for being frugal, **$BigBoss**!), we could get a piece of equipment that we really needed without the City Council telling us that we didn't really need it.  *Lol*.\n\nSo I immediately reached out to start getting quotes.  I got several from a number of sources - none of which were **$LazyCo**, of course.  Our normal printer supplier got in touch with us and offered us a great deal on a new system.  I was thoroughly impressed.  To put it in perspective, this brand-new system that they were willing to sell us was about $3,000 *cheaper* than what we'd purchased in 2014!  When I did the call with their reps and explained all the issues I'd had with **$LazyCo**, they openly laughed on the phone.  We decided to go with them.  They apologized to me that, due to supply difficulties, it might take up to six weeks to ship everything to us.  I told them if they managed to get the system here within the year I would be happy.  It arrived in *four* weeks, not six :)  It wasn't an entirely painless setup, but it was far better than anything I'd ever dealt with from **$LazyCo**.  We had the new plotter\/scanner set up a week after it arrived.  Its been working ever since.  I've printed dozens of maps on it since it's been installed.  They look great.  The scanner actually has guiderails!  By every conceivable metric, this system exceeds the one **$LazyCo** pissed out on us.\n\nAnd on that note, what about **$LazyCo**?\n\nWithin a week of us reaching out for quotes, they must have gotten wind that we were looking for a new system.  I got a call from **$SmarmyIT** to \"check up on us.\"  He asked if we were trying to replace our system, to which I answered, truthfully, that yes we were.  He then got all defensive and asked why I hadn't called them.  I stayed cordial on the phone, but after I heard him say for the third time that \"*they could supply us with everything we'd need*\", I got a little irritated.  I rebutted with the following:\n\n>**$Me**: You all sold us an old system for an inflated price, had us pay a maintenance contract on a device that you didn't support, have been consistently late on every service call I've made to you, never got us a new passthrough machine I requested of you multiple times, and did not once heed the instructions I sent to you regarding our invoices.  What am I supposed to say about all this?\n\nThe proverbial mic drop if there ever was one.  **$SmarmyIT** stammered a little bit and tried to deflect some of what I said (oh, that was the office staff, not my crew!)  Eventually, I just told him that we weren't interested and thanked him for the call.  He said to keep us in mind.  I said I would \/s.  A few days later, his boss called me.  She tried a hard sales pitch to me for a new combo.  The cost was 50% higher than what we'd already purchased.  I listened to all of it, and at the end said this:\n\n>**$Me**: Thank you.  We're not interested.  Take care!\n\n*And then I hung up the f\\*cking phone on her*.  It was glorious.  She didn't call back :D\n\nThat's the last time I've heard from them.  In the meantime, it's nice to have a plotter that we don't have to fight every time we want to us it.  Maybe, just maybe, this device isn't the demonspawn that all the others have been.  Maybe, just maybe, there is hope for this plotter after all :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, folks!

Initially it had nothing but OOB functionality. However, users rebelled so we heavily customized the product. (If I ever run a fortune 500 org, any customization will have to demonstrate the value add many times over before it's implemented.) But even the heavily customized result did not satisfy all users.\n\nI made the documentation for the new tool and did all the training (job aids, office hours, a full SOP, WBTs, etc etc). My documentation initially described the OOB version. Post rebellion I edited it to capture the customized version. Unfortunately, there were a few pages where I didn't quite finish the editing process for the SOP. I had to step away from it for a few days and forgot about those pages. So it was published with 2-3 discrepancies.\n\nI will always remember how one of them was brought to my attention. I was holding yet another office hours session, fielding questions and sharing my screen while I demonstrated how to use the product.  When it was time for one of our German employees to have his turn, he took the screen and brought up the SOP I had written. He then announced that I was deceiving him and everyone else on the call.\n\nI had explained in earlier sessions that functionality he desired did not exist in the tool. However, he had found a screenshot in the SOP that proved it DID exist!! The SOP had two screenshots that differed slightly, and that difference could only be explained by the existence of this functionality that he so desperately wanted! My protestations that it was just an editing error where futile in the face of this proof! (I am not making this up. He would not be swayed from his convictions.) He told me he would have his manager contact my manager and have this cover-up exposed.\n\nI was amused by this exchange more than anything else. How many people can say they are part of a company wide conspiracy to cheat our users due to spite, laziness, and\/or miserliness? I can. (This even beat out the time when a manager offered to throw in with me on a root cause analysis and shaft another team). I corrected the error, along with the other two I found in the SOP, and gave my manager a heads-up that The Crazy would phone him soon and demand that we all be executed.\n\nUnfortunately, I never heard about this again and the fellow who raised this issue acted like it never happened. That is the real crime here. I had hoped at least for some sort of public trial, even if only by zoom, but it was not to be. I've always wanted to parade around a courtroom, holding my suspenders between my fingers, sucking on piece of straw between my teeth, announcing that \"I'm just an old country data\/process analyst.\"\n\nIf this sort of thing ever happens again (I've changed companies, but you never know), I'll demand a bigger cut of the operation. Next time buying my silence will be expensive.\n\nEdit:  The editing error had nothing to with the functionality my German colleague wanted, What he wanted was not possible in the OOB version, nor in the end result super customized version. It was just coincidence that the editing error could have made it appear that way.

You see, the other (not John) owner of the company I work for is a crafty man (let's call him Harold because he looks like a Harold, think My Cousin Vinny with a head of glorious white hair). Harold would much prefer to trade services whenever possible rather than pay for things he needs. As technology seems to be the most elusive facet of modern life for those who remember black and white TV, my services are frequently the outgoing half of any given barter.  Having graduated high school before the Moon had footprints, Harold's factory warranty has long sense expired and as such he has a close relationship with various medical practitioners in the area. One of his favorites is another man of a certain age who also has a predilection for the bartering of services. In this case, I had recently spearheaded a project at our office to install a new security camera and DVR system that Harold was absolutely blown away by, and which he lovingly described as \"the cat's behind\" to all of his friends including the doctor in question. When it came time for another procedure, the doctor was more than happy to accept a new camera system in lieu of payment from Harold. And so it begins.\n\nCast:\n\n$Me - NoRecommendation8630 himself, in the flesh. Certified IT adventurer.\n\n$Harold - A boss of mine, part owner of the company. Reasonable, funny, generous, wonderful to work for. Absolutely the Anti-John.\n\n$Doctor - Self explanatory. Just a really good guy. As long as the things do the stuff, he's happy as a clam.\n\n$TK - The Doctor's wife. Henceforth known as Turbo Karen. Probably sitting home right now drafting complaints about things that haven't happened yet, just in case.\n\nThe Event (Part One):\n\nI'd place this around mid-spring, 2018. I can't be sure as the seasons tend to blur together somewhat but it was definitely between Rose's Bank and John's Monitors and I vividly remember the car I was driving at the time. $Harold called me into his office to explain the scope of what I'd been lent out to do, and added that I'd need to order a security camera system similar to what we had but \"without all the pomp and circumstance\" because the doctor wouldn't need or use the majority of the features we had. Then came the budget for the project which was about 10% of the number that was rattling around in my head, causing a modicum of unease. I found a suitable system, albeit from a vendor I'd never heard of, and placed the order hoping against hope that it wouldn't be TOO offbrand. It arrived a couple of weeks later and $Harold passed it on to one of our electricians to do the actual installation, running the Cat5 cables through the drop ceilings, mounting the cameras and all that. My part would come later when it came time for configuration.\n\nLike a good library book, I happily went where I was checked out when the time came. I packed a go-bag with network testing tools, my diagnostic laptop and some other nonsense just in case. Jumped in my car and made the \\~30 minute drive from our office to a beautiful Midcentury modern glass-and-stone doctor's office in a nearby affluent suburb. A very confused but lovely receptionist retrieved the doctor for me, and I met the man who may as well have been Mister Rogers. A much more hip Mister Rogers, clean cut and proper but dripping with that 'English professor at a coffee shop' vibe. The kind of guy you see rounding a corner down the hall and just intrinsically trust. Beneath his white coat was a spotless pair of well-pleated khakis and a navy blue V-neck knit sweater that I'd bet had leather elbows to match his shoes. His smile was bright, his manner calm and his small talk effortless.\n\n$Doctor - \"Hey $Me, thanks for coming! I'm excited to have this up and running. We don't need it in this neighborhood but hey, peace of mind right?\"\n\n$Me - \"No problem, doc, happy to be here. Can you please show me where they put the DVR?\"\n\nDown a brightly lit corridor we went, past a row of windows overlooking the parking lot.\n\n$Doctor - \"That your Beamer out there?\"\n\nWe chatted about cars for a moment as we arrived at a nondescript closet at the end of the hall, the doc eventually leaving me to it with a cheerful \"wander and find me if you need anything, help yourself to coffee and snacks in the breakroom down the hall.\"\n\nStep one, open the User's Guide. And my heart hit the floor. On the first page was a pictogram of a camera with a sad face, dripping, and a caption something like \"Fig. 1: It is badly making if connections to camera is wetness.\" Fantastic. Splendid. This system is indeed VERY offbrand. Praying to any given deity that I wouldn't need to reference this lovely piece of literature any further (mmm tasty foreshadowing), I dove straight into the menus. DHCP is working, IP addressing seems okay, all the cameras are there, standard recording rules are fine, etc. Satisfied, I retrieved some appreciated coffee from the breakroom and wandered to find the doctor for the last part of the process, the interface software itself. It installed effortlessly on his office PC, found the DVR on the network and all seemed well. I gave $Doctor a quick crash course in live monitoring and playback, installed TeamViewer for future troubleshooting, made a note of his ID and gave him my card to call with any questions. Wrapping up a textbook open-and-shut deployment I mentally patted myself on the back while stowing my laptop back in its bag and wondering casually if the doctor might tip.\n\nWhen suddenly just outside the half-closed door, I couldn't help but to hear an exchanging of words.\n\n$Doctor - \"Really $TK I'm not sure why we need that at all.\"\n\n$TK - \"What good is a security system if you can't watch it from everywhere!\"\n\nThe door opened and revealed my nightmare. Flashbacks from my time in retail hit so hard I was briefly dizzy. There stood the Karen-est Karen to ever demand parley with management. Reverse graduated bob haircut? Check. Obvious, symmetrical highlights? Check. Adorned with enough diamonds and gold to make the Maharaja blush and wearing a blouse worth more than my monthly grocery spend, $TK strutted into the room and extended her hand with the most sickly-sweet yet threatening smile I'd ever seen.\n\n$TK - \"Hi, $Me, I'm $TK and I have some concerns about this system. $Doctor tells me you haven't installed anything on his phone and I'm curious why that would be.\"\n\n$Me - \"Oh, honestly no worries, no one requested remote viewing so I was under the impression this would be a local installation only. I'd be happy to take care of that for you.\"\n\nThis was not at all an unreasonable ask from her, it was just outside what I understood to be the scope of work. With a twitch of the wrist and the jingle of a stack of bracelets, she produced a Swarovski-encrusted iPhone and thrust it into my hands. I got to work installing and configuring the remote viewing app. This took FAR longer than it should have due to the system's er... excellent documentation, and culminated in a call to $Doctor's MSP to have the requisite ports forwarded, allowing remote access to the DVR. Of course $TK sat across from me with an expression growing more sour by the second, her dagger eyes digging progressively more deeply into my soul as I fiddled with her phone. Each time I paused to consult the (worthless) User Manual, her phone would lock itself. Each time she unlocked it with a jingle and a sigh. Avoiding eye contact, I repeated the process for $Doctor's password-free phone with significantly less difficulty and we were off to the races.\n\n$Me - (I was here representing $Harold so customer service had to be perfect) \"Okay $TK here are your phones back, you guys are all set. $Doctor has my card if you need anything else.\"\n\n$TK thanked me with a cold, jingly handshake and a facial expression that did not match her words. Before she could think of anything else to say, ask or do, I hastily collected my things and made my escape. It was over, or so I thought.\n\nThe Event (Part Two)\n\nA couple of weeks later, my phone rang a number I did not recognize. It was $Doctor, and he was whispering.\n\n$Doctor - \"Hey $Me, sorry to bother you man but I really need your help. She's... watching me.\"\n\n$Me - \"Watching you? Who's watching you?\"\n\n$Doctor - \"$TK. She sits at home and... watches. She texts and asks about this and that, calls my staff asking how many breaks they've taken, accuses me of standing too close to the front desk girls, it's unsettling and disruptive. Is there anything you can do to turn these cameras off during the day?\"\n\n$Me - (suddenly understanding why his phone was the one without the password lock) \"Honestly I'm not sure. I've never tried to outsmart one of these systems before. They're designed to be pretty peopleproof. Let me get back to you.\"\n\nCue a few hours of frantic research and brainstorming. Does the wonderfully-translated product documentation have any information on this? No. Can I program the DVR to shut off or disable remote viewing on a schedule? Of course not, that doesn't make sense. Can I set up access rules for this device on the network? No, their MSP was hardly willing to forward ports for me and I shuddered at the thought of explaining all of this to them. Can I put the DVR on a timer? No, someone would have to manually turn it back on every night and the hard shutdowns wouldn't be good for the drive. Then it hit me. I can put its connection on a timer! I rang $Doctor.\n\n$Me - \"Doc, I have an idea. It's probably not the most elegant solution but I've got the stuff I need in stock, I can be there in 30 minutes if that's okay.\"\n\n$Doctor - (still whispering) \"She's... here. Can I call you when she leaves?\"\n\n$Me - \"Just send a text and I'll head over the second I get it.\"\n\nI explained the situation to $Harold and received clearance from the tower to \"make it work.\" We shared a chuckle about $TK and about the delightful simplicity of my plan. My decision to take my go-bag with me to lunch proved prudent, as $Doctor called back two bites shy of the end of my burrito.\n\n$Doctor - \"She's gone, are you free?\"\n\n$Me - \"On my way!\"\n\nThis time, the receptionist skipped the confusion and led me straight to the closet where the DVR lived. I retrieved a programmable timer and a cheapo 5 port Gigabit switch from my bag, installed them behind the DVR and configured the timer to turn on at 5:01PM and off at 6:59AM daily. Was that a jingle from the hallway?  The glint of a diamond in my peripheral?  No, I assured myself, you're being paranoid.  I ran the network cable for the DVR through the switch and, expecting $TK to pop out from behind any door or materialize from any shadow, hastily packed up and went to find $Doctor.\n\n$Me - \"$Doctor, may I see your phone please?\"\n\n$Doctor handed me his phone and watched as I tapped the app for the cameras. 'Unable to connect to device.' Perfect. We went back to the DVR closet, I clicked the manual override button on the timer, and the little switch flashed to life. Seconds later, the camera feeds presented themselves on $Doctor's phone. Click the override once again, the lights go out and 'Unable to connect to device.'\n\n$Me - \"The DVR will still record to the hard drive while this device is inactive in case something happens and you need the footage, but remote viewing will only work at night when you aren't here. Tell $TK there was a software update for security or something.\"\n\n$Doctor - \"No problem, I planned to make something up about HIPAA regulations. Thank you SO MUCH for all your help! Come see me first if you ever have medical needs.\" Unlike $TK's, $Doctor's handshakes and facial expressions effortlessly matched his words.\n\nAnd it turns out $Doctor is an excellent tipper, just not when $TK is around.\n\nTL;DR: Installed a security camera system for a doctor's office, then put its internet connection on a timer to stop doctor's wife from watching him all day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Phrasing and grammar.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1671559336.0},{"title":"that is ALL of the internet","author":"elder_techpriest","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zqqdzo\/that_is_all_of_the_internet\/","text":"Recently, I started working in IT department of an accounting company with about 70 employees. The \"IT department\" is really only just us 2 nerds, lurking in the basement of the building, occasionally coming out when a printer is refusing to cooperate. We do some bigger, long-term assignments too, but most of the time we just deal with trivial stuff like this. The point is - our job is pretty chill most of the time. This is very convenient, as we're no specialists by any means. We're both self-taught, we can solve small day-to-day problems, we can handle the sql server, and if there's any bigger issue, we will deal with it too, after we figure out how.\n\nThis really isn't a problem, since many of the younger employees will try and figure things out themselves before they call us. However, there's a lot of older people working here too, and while most of them are really sweet, when their computers do anything out of the ordinary, they tend to panic.\n\nSometimes tho... well, listen.\n\nThat one day I got a call from $thatlady, she was complaining that her computer is very slow and she has trouble connecting to the server.

Can you do something about it?\n\n$me: alright, lemme take a look.\n\nWell, she was right, it was slow. Something seemed off, but I couldn't really put my finger on it.\n\n$me: Hmm, it really is slow, that's for suuuuuuu...\n\nIt was at this moment when I noticed it. It was so bizarre that at first I sort of ignored it. She had 3 instances of Chrome running at the same time, all of which had around 300 tabs opened. Bloody hell.\n\n$me: Woah, why do you need so many tabs opened?\n\n$tahtlady: Oh well, I  just need them to be there so I can instantly access them when needed.\n\nRight, obviously.

Later, over a beer the CEO told me that he, his brother and $theothernerd all talked to her about this at some point, and she just laughed them off, proceeding to bitch about her slow computer to someone else. Apparently, she did that exact same thing with her old PC.

Before closing the sales and accounting departments of our office (operations continued to run as some of the services this company provides fell under the umbrella of essential work per the US government) we purchased a laptop for every employee.  I took one, created an Admin account and a limited User account, set up some quick troubleshooting tools (read: TeamViewer), imaged the drive and deployed it to all of them (yay sameness), tagged them into inventory and issued one to everyone that would be working from home along with a VoIP phone and a goodie bag of cables and miscellany.  Yes, even John.  But you see, John being John and all, the same laptop as everyone else simply... wouldn't do.  No, John took it upon himself to re-enter the office the next day (of course it was a Saturday) and retrieve the desktop computer from his office complete with all 4 monitors and, shockingly, all of the cables.  So it's Saturday evening and I'm lazing about on the sofa with my fianc\u00e9e, right about to click Play on the next mindless Netflix binge when my phone rings.\n\n$John - Hey $Me, lemme ask you a question. (This is how John ALWAYS starts conversations when he's unhappy about something so I brace myself.)\n\n$Me - Hey $John, you know it's Saturday evening, right?  I'm kind of preoccupied here.\n\n$John - This'll just take a second, bud, and it's an emergency.  This computer is a piece of \\[expletive deleted\\].

So I went and got mine.  And all the screens! (very proud of himself indeed.)\n\n$Me - (face in palm, knowing full well I have to make this work or I'll never be able to rescue a shred of my Saturday evening) Great.  Lovely.  Okay.  Because I can't see what you're seeing let's start from the beginning.  You should have 5 power cables, they're all the same and it doesn't matter what each goes to.

(That is a tale I will share another day, but John did remember the printer incident and my point was made.)\n\n$John - Fine $Me, 5 power cables, plugged into a power strip.  Other ends plugged into 4 monitors and the computer tower.  Power strip is on. (Good on him for checking this!  I was, and still am, thoroughly shocked at his uncharacteristic attention to detail here.)\n\n$Me - Wonderful!  Now you brought your mouse and keyboard, and the little nub is plugged into the tower?\n\n$John - Yeah I've got those, but I also know they have nothing to do with the screens so if you're about done wasting my \\[expletive deleted\\] Saturday night with this...\n\n$Me - $John, it's my Saturday night too, so I only want to go through this ONCE.  We. Are. Going. To. Check. EVERYTHING.  Now, the HDMI cables.  There should be four of-\n\n$John - (bowling me over, like he does) I told you the screen cables were plugged in!

Then contained my expletives long enough still to open Display Settings and organize the screens.  But I will admit to losing my temper an hour and a half into this \"just a second\" call, during the configuration of his VoIP phone.  Now these phones are stupid easy to set up.  Ethernet from the router into the phone and from the phone to the computer.  Would you believe that the ports on the phone are labeled Internet and Computer?  Apparently that... is not clear enough for some people.  I.e. John.  We resorted to FaceTime wherein there was quite a bit of \"no, stop, stop, plug that cable into the top one.  The TOP ONE.  John, pick the phone back up and unplug that cable from the bottom port.  It goes in the \\[expletive deleted\\] TOP ONE!\"  But would you believe that he's REALLY good at sales?\n\nMeanwhile, the fianc\u00e9e was absolutely in tears laughing.  My exasperated face, phone in hand and all, was our Christmas card that year.\n\nTL;DR Sales manager is too good for a laptop but can't properly connect HDMI cables to a desktop PC.

No big deal, I get up the admin console and give her a call. She was a remote user and didn't get her laptop on VPN every now and then as we suggested, so it locked out. She had last worked over VPN within 30 days, so her laptop object was still in the database and recoverable.\n\nNote for those not familiar, McAfee Safeboot provides the multiple word challenge & response which is needed to unlock the computer IF it has been seen on the network within 30 days. They are provided in both forms on both the admin and user sides; such as ABCD *AND* Alpha Bravo Charlie Delta, etc.\n\nAfter the usual greeting and preliminary information gathering, I get her into the next screen with the passphrase that I need to get started:\n\n- Please give me the the letters that are displayed on your screen.\n\n- She does this, reading them off as ABCD, etc. I feed it into my console application and get her to her next screen where she needs to type in the safeboot response that I will give her.

Video cards are still up in the stratosphere, we're a bit edgy as COVID-19 is the highest it's ever been, it's early December and a kid is about to become extremely disappointed on Chrismas Day.\n\nA single mother came to me with a \"gaming PC\". She'd been told to turn it on and make sure everything works right, to give her a chance of putting it right before the big day.\n\nEverything did work right. Exactly as sold.\n\nThis was a \"dodgy seller on Amazon\" gaming PC, however. So yes, it did have a Core i7 in it. It did have a discrete GPU \"for the most intensive action packed games\". It did have 8 GB of memory and a \"huge\" 2 TB of storage.\n\nThe compliant?\n\n\"It's really bad in CS:GO.\"\n\nNow, CS:GO is one of those games almost everyone's at least familiar with, and it's really hard to run it badly. 15-20 FPS on the 1920x1080 monitor I hooked it up to.\n\n\"We don't have a lot of money, it took me all year to save up enough for this, and it's just not right. I can't return it now.\"\n\nWell that upped the stakes.\n\n\"Okay lady, leave this with me, I'll call you when it's running CS:GO properly.\"\n\nShe left, maybe with some trepidation. I didn't know her, she didn't know me. She'd just left \u00a3500 of her stuff at a stranger's place. Her kid's gaming PC probably weighed heavily on her mind that night.\n\nPopped up HWInfo64.\n\nIt checked out: Core i7-6700T, 8 GB DDR4 2133, Intel HD 530 video, 2 TB WD Blue... Hang on, what?\n\nOkay, I had the monitor plugged into the motherboard. School boy er...Wait. She said that the other port didn't work.\n\nI powered down, switched to the GPU, and got nothing. Dead GPU? Well this'd be a warranty return, but probably not by the 25th. Exactly what is in this... 6700T? What's a 6700T? Who built this? What built this?\n\nThe motherboard looked like an Asrock (you learn what sort of styling and placements the different vendors use) but had no logo on it. I'd heard of ghost-shift Gigabytes, Asrock was a new one on me.\n\nStrip it down and find out what's going on here. The DDR4 was 2400 rated, but Skylake would only usually hit 2133 anyway. The CPU was indeed an i7-6700T. A quick browse to ARK told me it was basically a downclocked 6700 with a 35W TDP. That explains the really empty radial fin heatsink. The HDD was indeed a 2 TB WD Blue. The GPU was a... what the heck was this?\n\nA plastic box with \"GAMER PC\" in red on the side (the side facing outward when installed) had a few holes in the \"bottom\" (where fans usually are) and a backplate cover on the back. It wasn't like any video card I'd seen before. It also didn't work. No test rig  I had would coax it into doing video. It went to one side. A mystery for later.\n\nCS:GO would indeed run badly on a Skylake GT2 (only 24 EUs, this was up from 20 in Haswell GT2, which was okay for two years earlier, in 2014, but here we were in 2021) and whatever was in that plastic tomb wasn't going to help.\n\nOkay - Replacement GPU, send it on its way.\n\nDifficulty level: Late 2021 in Britain.\n\nA GT 730 on Amazon was \u00a390. NINTEY POUNDS! An RX 550 was \u00a3180. Shit. This kid needs something for games, and they're not things for games. CeX and ebay also echoed silly prices.\n\nOkay, okay, calm down. What do I have in stock? Corporate pulls, stuff from recycling dumps, etc. Radeon HD 5770, GeForce GT430, aha, GTX 680 from eVGA.\n\nThe GTX 680 was a 195 watt video card on release, and used Nvidia's somewhat optimistic TDP ratings, it'd usually run around 230 watts. The PSU in there was a GlobalKing Ultra Divine 750 Watt Serene 80+ Plutonium Modular, with \"Modular\" meaning it had some pictures of squares on the side. It weighed so little that I briefly thought helium-filled PSUs had become a thing.\n\nJust then, the 6700T reminded me \"This system is built to use very little power\" and \"That PSU isn't any I've ever seen before\" and it had no PCIe 8 pin, just two six pins on the same cable run. Never good.\n\nTrue enough, running the GTX 680 on two six pins didn't work in games. It had worked on two six pins on a somewhat  less dodgy PSU, so I was probably dealing with a 300-400 watt PSU here. Fuck.\n\nWhat else could I do? Oh!!! I'd bought a box of of 24 GTX 750s ages ago \"as seen\" at an auction. Most of them didn't work (9 of them worked), the box was water damaged, but some of them did and I'd already made back the outlay. The ones not working had bad fans, the GPU worked but would throttle back a lot. I've got a few replacement fans, but not got around even now (Dec 2022) to actually doing anything with them. These were GM206 based GTX 750s, half the GPU was disabled, they were probably best described as a GT 930 or GT 940. It was half a GTX 960.\n\nThe Maxwell GPUs were known to be very power efficient, as well as still quite sufficient for light gaming. They had 2 GB, ran around 1,100 MHz, and had a HDMI, DVI-I and DP on the back.\n\nSlotted one in, no power connector needed, and it fired up. CS:GO ran great.\n\nI handed it back, charged \u00a350 and a Merry Christmas. Sure, she could pay me in January (she did) and I didn't even mention the \u00a322 250 GB SSD I'd dropped in for the boot drive. 'Tis the season and all that.\n\nSo, what was that weird GAMER PC video card? Well, I'll cover that in the comments.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1671220490.0},{"title":"If it fits in memory, it's not big data.","author":"FinalDevice","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zmu0qc\/if_it_fits_in_memory_its_not_big_data\/","text":"This might stretch the definition of tech support. I was supporting and enabling a large company's migration from on-premises datacenters to cloud hosting.\n\nAt some point I was in charge of migrating data from an old mainframe system into *the cloud*. By \"in charge\" I mean, another team designed a migration that would require an army of servers, complicated clustering logic, and a ton of code. It didn't work, and thus became my problem.\n\nThe original team had used all kinds of fancy tools and design patterns to manage this big data. Many servers talked to a caching server. A backup of a database was exported to a csv file, with the intention of loading that into a dedicated cache server. The actual data to be migrated was exported to two other csv files, each containing nearly a terabyte of data. No, we couldn't just stream through the file one row at a time. It had to be grouped, chunked by certain values, and and and and and.\n\nI remembered a snarky line I'd found online somewhere: If it fits in memory, it's not big data. Huh. What's the biggest EC2 instance I can reserve in AWS? \n\nSolution: I loaded up a 128-core server that had 2TB of memory. Loaded the entire contents of the database backup into memory. Took one of the ~1TB CSV files containing the data to be migrated, and loaded it all in memory as well. Spun through all the data, streaming it into the new system.\n\nThat stupid server cost something like $300\/day to rent, but it was actually cheaper than the entire fleet of hardware that we were supposed to use - and I only needed it temporarily, while the migration was running. Turns out it's a hell of a lot easier to migrate data to a new system when you can just load it all in memory and figure it out from there.\n\nBonus: `top` has a bug. You know how it displays CPU utilization on a per-core basis? So if you have 2 cores, the max usage is 200%. If you have 4 cores, the max is 400%. If you have 128 cores, the max is ... 9999%.

And on all three boards in each of the other two units in the order.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKevin had used a powered screwdriver with a removable Phillips bit to install all of the screws.  \n\nInstead of stopping when they were snug, he kept on grinding away until the screwheads were completely drilled out.\n\nAll 36 of them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere did the Phillips screwdriver come from?\n\nKevin explained that he noticed that there were no Phillips screwdrivers in the lab, so he went to the hardware store and bought a new set for each bench.\n\nHe also picked up a bunch of replaceable Phillips bits because they somehow seemed to be missing from all of the sets.\n\nAnd he brought his own powered driver from home so his hands wouldn't get tired.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had to use a tiny chisel to cut a slot into what little metal was left of each screwhead, so that I could get a grip on it with a tiny flathead screwdriver.\n\nAfter removing the \"bad\" board I was able to diagnose the problem.\n\nThe board was fine.\n\nMetal filings from the destroyed screws had fallen inside and were shorting some connections together\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAftermath:\n\nI kicked Kevin out of the assembly lab and spent the rest of the day removing all of the boards, cleaning out the metal shavings, and then correctly re-installing them.\n\nThey all passed their tests.  \n\nBy the time I was finished, we had missed the last shipping pick-up time for the day, so the units had to be shipped out on the following Monday.\n\nThe CEO blamed me for the delay, because it was apparently my fault, not Kevin's, that the units were not ready on time.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1671037613.0},{"title":"\"Why are my emails getting kicked back?\"","author":"Souta95","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zlyiwq\/why_are_my_emails_getting_kicked_back\/","text":"Just had this call come in a few minutes ago and wanted to share it.\n\n\\*Phone rings\\* Maintenance department director on the CID\n\nMe: IT department, how can I help?\n\nDirector: Hi, I want to know why whenever I try to send an email to <person at company> the email is getting kicked back.\n\nMe: What does the kickback email say the reason is?\n\nDirector: Ummm...

It's a medium sized business with many different divisions doing many different types of outdoor services for clients.  It's a big enough company to need IT infrastructure beyond a few PCs and a network switch, but small enough that the chain of command bottom to top only has 4 or 5 links.  I was hired on originally to do fieldwork (read: labor) for one of their divisions almost a decade ago.  My time in the field lasted all of 6 months before the owner of the company happened to discover through idle conversation that I had a knack for fixing things and a love of technology.  From that day forth, I have comprised the entire IT department.  I've got about 100 users across 4 offices in 3 US states.  Most of my users are lovely people, although the majority of them are largely ignorant of technology.  So I spend most of my days resetting passwords, turning things off and on again, replacing toner and running reports.  I say most users are lovely because there are a few that truly... are not.  This tale regards a user of the latter type, who was a mainstay of the company for nearly 20 years but has (thankfully) since retired.\n\nCast:\n\n$Me - NoRecommendation8630 himself, in the flesh.  Certified IT adventurer.\n\n$Rose - Elderly, but definitely not in the \"I wish you were my grandmother\" sort of way.  Terrified of two things: technology, and change.  Of course Rose is not her real name, but it does evoke imagery of the proper curly white hair.  In my mind anyway.\n\nThe Event:\n\nRose was very stuck in her ways and routinely refused computer and equipment upgrades because she \"doesn't like it when things are different.\"  Rose frequently came across my Caller ID to complain about the slowness of her Windows XP, Core2Duo machine.  Since this was 2015, these complaints were understandable, but most of those calls went as follows, round and round for several months:\n\n$Rose: \"$Me, this machine is so slow I'll be dead before my bank statements download!\"\n\n$Me: \"I'm sorry Rose, but your computer is beyond upgrading.  I've been trying to replace it but you always decide you'd rather stick with your familiar environment.\"\n\n$Rose: (snippily) \"Because YOU refuse to make it better without having to make it different!\" \\*click\\*\n\nWhen her geriatric computer's poor old hard drive finally refused to load to the desktop one morning, Rose relented and authorized the upgrade.  I nervously approached her desk with a shiny new Windows 10 machine, complete with all of the software she would need and all of the files I could salvage from her quickly expiring hard drive in the best approximation of the folder structure that I could manage.  I set up the machine, helped her find the power button and log in, answered eleventy thousand (maybe I'm exaggerating but just a little) questions about Windows 10 and why it was different than Windows XP, and retreated to my own office in the next building over.  Case closed, or so I thought.  The serene feeling of a flawless deployment washed over me as I finished the second cup of terrible office coffee.  That feeling was, however, short lived.  My phone rang, and my heart hit the floor when I read the Caller ID.  Rose.\n\n$Me: \"Hi Rose, how can I help?\"\n\n$Rose: \"YOU DELETED IT!\"\n\n$Me: \"I did what now?  I did mention that not all of your files were recoverable, but the most recent ones all were, going back a year or so, and if you're having trouble finding something I'm sure we can find it together.\"\n\n$Rose: (absolutely frantic) \"YOU DELETED (bank)!  ITS GONE!  HOW CAN YOU DO THIS?  WHAT ABOUT ALL OF THEIR OTHER CUSTOMERS AND WHAT ABOUT ALL OF OUR MONEY?! THIS HAS TO BE ILLEGA-\"\n\n$Me: (cutting her off) \"Rose, I do not control the internet, or the banks, or their websites.  I am sure I didn't delete anything like that.\"\n\n$Rose: \"YOU DID!  ITS GONE!  ITS ALL GONE!  THE BANK, MY MONEY, IT'S GONE!\"\n\n$Me: \"I'll be right over.\"\n\nI walked to her desk, slightly shaken and expecting the worst.  When I arrived, I was greeted with more frantic screeching that I will save you, dear reader, from experiencing.  It culminated in the following conversation:\n\n$Rose: (physically stabbing the new LCD monitor with a pen) \"It used to be RIGHT HERE!  The bank used to be RIGHT HERE!\"\n\n$Me: \"On your desktop?  Was this a program?\"\n\n$Rose: (shouting again and stabbing the screen in between words) \"NO!  THE BANK!  USED TO BE!  RIGHT HERE!\"\n\n$Me: (now understanding what is happening) \"Oh, you used to have a shortcut to the bank on your desktop.  Okay, no worries, hang on I'll put it back.\"\n\n$Rose: \"I don't know what a shortcut is but you BETTER BRING BACK THAT BANK!\"\n\nI spent the next 30 seconds recreating a shortcut to the bank's login page on her desktop right beneath the black ink mark her pen jabs had left on the screen, then I clicked it and her eyes lit up but her demeanor did not change.\n\n$Rose: \"Well it's a GOOD THING I CALLED YOU because otherwise you would have cost THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE their entire BANK ACCOUNTS!  You CAN'T just GO AROUND DELETING THINGS!  ESPECIALLY NOT BANKS! THEY'RE TOO IMPORTANT!\"\n\nI didn't have the heart to tell her that her shortcut wasn't actually in control of the bank's website, but that's okay.  To this day she probably still thinks that 3 letter bank's entire website and the data for all their accounts still lives on the desktop of the PC at her old desk.  The day I signed her retirement card I had my own little private party in my mind because while this may be the most vibrant Rose tale from my years working with her, it certainly isn't the only one.\n\nTL;DR: Old lady gets new computer and loses website shortcut, thinks entire bank has been deleted from existence because of it.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1671045231.0},{"title":"Information is Overrated","author":"TheRubiksDude","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zl6jpc\/information_is_overrated\/","text":"For some reason the helpdesk and desktop support team where I work think information is overrated.

I'd left just before 7am, aiming to do about 60km. When I reached what was around my half way point at 8am I took a short break to enjoy the peace of the ocean, which was promptly interrupted by a call from my boss.\n\n*\\[Client\\]'s database is down. I found the server off when I got in, so I turned it on but 5 mins later it still wasn't working so I turned it off and on again. I tried calling \\[tech who was actually working that day\\] but he isn't answering.*\n\nI should point out we shared offices with this client, they were a financial services provider and many of their clients were very wealthy. As a result, when we moved in our dress code went from polo+jeans to \"business casual\" which by their definition meant proper trousers, business shirt, dress shoes for the guys, and conservative dress, skirt\/blouse, or pants-suit for the women.\n\nThis is because the office had to have a professional financial services look to it. Apparently one of the 'new money' rich clients of theirs had complained. You know the type, obvious expensive brand clothing, drives a Mercedes\/Porsche\/Maserati, oozes the attitude they are better than everyone else. By contrast, their 'old money' clients were some of the most chill down to earth people you'd ever meet, and never guess they were worth 10 figures.\n\nThe techs were not happy about the dress code at all. Yes, lets move servers around, get under desks, on our knees trying to move shit around while wearing business attire. So I'd be looking for some revenge for this for a while, especially given the cost of having to buy trousers and business shirts along with the time to iron them.\n\n**The cause:** There had been a power outage overnight and the server had not restarted automatically. It was later found that the power outage was just long enough for the UPS to trigger server shutdown, but power came back on during the shutdown so the normal power-on-ac-restore didn't trigger.\n\n**The attempted fix:** My boss (who wasn't actually technical) tried to fix it by powering on the server but after 5 mins the databases hadn't come online so they forced a reset which put the database into an inconsistent state on next boot. Normally with this system it was a 10 min wait from power on to fully functioning database but they did not wait to ask anyone who knows.\n\n*But I just did what you always say, turn it off and on again!*\n\n`That is for desktops, not servers.`\n\n*Oh...*\n\nI explained the situation, that they needed to wait for the dev to arrive to fix it, that I couldn't do anything about it.\n\n*I still need you to come in, they are our most important client.*\n\nIt was at this point I told her I was 30km from home and 35km from work, oh, and I'm on my bike so I'll probably be 60-90 mins before I can be there. They insisted.\n\n`Okay, but I'm putting OT down from this moment until I leave work.`\n\n*Fine....*\n\nI arrived at work hot, sweaty and in my lycra riding kit, which I might add is so tight you can tell what religion I am.\n\nI spent the next hour assisting getting it all back up and running while walking around the office with messy hair, bare feet, and highly inappropriate attire to be around rich snobs.\n\nI copped quite a few hostile glares, some shocked staring, and a few of the financial advisers taking just a bit too long a glance below the waist. You can't normally tell under my office attire, but at the time I was very fit, so most of them didn't know until then just how toned I was.\n\nCycled back home and had a new personal best for distance of 85km while getting paid for about half of it.\n\nLater my boss got chewed out for my appearance but knew they couldn't do squat to me because I complied with their demands to immediately attend on my day off.\n\nI no longer work there, I'm in a much better position with more pay and it extremely rare I get a call on my days off.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1670799094.0},{"title":"\"Our heater broke our power strip\"","author":"go_hyuck_yourself","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zi26uw\/our_heater_broke_our_power_strip\/","text":"Hello, long-time prowler, first-time poster.

Specifically, the testers were able to find their own Personally Identifying Information using only their access provided.  \n  \n**HIGH- Authentication Bypass**  \n  \n**Details**: Testers were able to bypass authentication to the Account Initialization script and create their own test credentials.  \n  \nAnd to twist the knife, there's a devastating backslap hidden somewhere in the 'process improvement' section, where the testers point out that GreyGoo was so disorganized that they didn't actually give the testers credentials until the second week of the penetration test. These testers did their heaviest lifting coming in from the cold. Gnarly.    \n  \nIf I were a more throrough consultant, I'd verify that I've got the necessary SharePoint access and whatever else I need while people are still around for the day. Because I'm a skilled consultant, I'm looking for a quiet place to participate in this call.  \n  \nUnfortunately, the help desk bullpen too noisy for me to run a call. I catch the attention of a painfully thin woman wearing a headset.   \n  \nMe:\"Hi there. I'm LawTechie. How do I reserve a conference room for a call?\"  \n  \nShe points at her headset and shrugs her shoulders.   \n  \nWoman:\"You need a conference room for call? Invite it to the call in Outlook\"  \n  \nWonderful. All the conference rooms are named after big cities. I have no idea if Berlin is within walking distance or in another building. Normally, I'd take the call from the comfort of the rental car, but I thought I'd be clever to take the bike. I do remember a few benches out front of the building. It's a nice day. What the hell.  \n  \nI've got a commanding view of the parking lot from my picnic bench. Decent wi-fi. All I need to be really comfortable outside would be a plate of bitterballen or wings and a pint of beer.   \n   \nThe call starts. According to the invite, about ten people have been invited. I'm guessing a company as big as GreyGoo has the culture where managers and subject matter experts get defensively invited to meetings. We'll wait for them like tramps waiting for Godot for the first five minutes anyway.  \n  \nCast of characters:  \n  \nNigel, the Product Lead of some data management component of Grey Goo. He's got the English accent of someone who left the UK and never looked back, but realizes their accent makes them classy, even if they're from Leeds. He's unhappy that the pentest report isn't full of glowing praise.  \n  \nKweisi, or Casey or something like that. They're calling from the bottom of the Fort Mc Henry tunnel or the loudest server room I've heard over the phone. I'm guessing by the noise, they're responsible for infrastructure.    \n  \nKelly. She's a project manager trying to keep to a deadline long past. She's like a newscaster at a second tier SoCal TV station cheerfully describing a bloody home invasion or schoolbus wreck.    \n  \nSally, a penetration tester from one of the other consulting firms Hoovering out cash from Grey Goo. If I remember correctly, she's listed as a junior on the pentest report. I'm guessing everyone more senior either moved on to greener pastures or just didn't care enough to show up.  \n  \nAnd some random 603 area code dial-in who hasn't introduced themselves.   \n  \nOnce consensus is obtained that nobody more important, we get started.  \n  \nNigel starts with an opening salvo:  \n  \nNigel:\"We've read the report. We have some concerns that these are issues in our test environment and not the customer facing environment. In that light, we'd like the 'High' findings changed to information or at least 'low'  \n  \nme:\"I don't want to speak for Sally, but the ability of an attacker to start with no credentials at all and end up with elevated rights in production concerns me.\"  \n  \nNigel:\"But the issues were with the _test_ environment.\"  \n  \nThis guy is doing his best Oxford don. I feel that I should have a handful of his robe in my hand to demand his attention next, like placing a stack of quarters on a bar pool table.   \n \nMe:\"Imagine you've got a warehouse where you store things of value. There's a customer entrance and an employee entrance. At both entrances, you have to be identified and determined if you're allowed to be there. At the customer entrance, they actually make sure that you're allowed in. At the employee entrance, they trust you when you say who you are and if you're allowed to be there.  \n  \nOnce you're in, you're **in  the same building**, despite what the sign over the door said. \"    \n  \nNigel's thinking.   \n  \n(603):\"Wharble Garble risk committee\"  \n  \nOh, great. (603)'s GRC.  \n  \nCasey:\"It hasn't gone to the risk committee yet. We need to finalize the report before we can refer it to them\"  \n  \nNigel:\"Exactly. We've put a hold on remediation planning until we can get these findings downgraded to Medium. Then we'll let you finalize the report.\"  \n  \nMe:\"In the grand scheme, what's the difference between a High and a Medium? You have a shorter time period to remediate Highs, right?\"  \n  \nKelly:\"That's correct. 30 days versus 90 for a Medium\"  \n  \nI quickly look back to the cover page on the report.   \n  \nThis test was completed almost seven months ago.  \n  \nMe:\"So you've been fighting this impact rating longer than the remediation window for either, is that correct\"  \n  \nNigel:\"We just don't believe these findings are worthy of the alarm that Sally's team raised\"  \n  \nMe:\"Because as you see it, the vulnerability was in a test environment\"  \n  \nNigel:\"Exactly\"  \n  \nMe:\"And because of this delay, you expect to remediate this around the time you're due for another pentest\"  \n  \nSally:\"I think we're starting a new one by the end of the year. We'd consider this out of scope\"  \n  \nKelly:\"Fine. Let's table this discussion for next week's call\"  \n  \nPleasantries are exchanged and I feel the need to just sit at this picnic table and breathe.  \n  \nI look up to notice a gleaming white SUV stopped in front of the motorcycle corrals. I watch as a man leans out of the driver's seat and views the six feet between my motorcycle and the old BMW bike.   \n  \nSatisfied with something, he gets back in his SUV and proceeds to pull his SUV into the space between the two bikes.   \n  \nStupidity is afoot. I slam my laptop lid closed and jog over, waving and failing to get this guy's attention.  \n  \n\n  \nWhile my Ducati and the \/7 are both European motorcycles, they're different. A BMW \/7 is a solid, well engineered motorcycle for serious motorcyclists. It's not fast or agile, but every angle it's hefty and durable. I'd imagine when small town banks commissioned new branches in the '70s, they'd task architects to make their buildings look as solid as a \/7. My Ducati Scrambler is about as solid as a BMX bicycle. Ducati design fetishizes light weight and agility and in pursuit, feel flimsy. A common joke is that the bolts and screws holding them together are actually made out of dried Parmesan. However, one part on both bikes is deliberately made heavy and solid. To reduce vibration, motorcycle handlebars have solid steel weights at the end. The bar end weight is probably the least meringue-like part of the whole machine.\n  \nAnd SUV guy just scraped a few feet of his Range Rover's front fender and driver's side door down my bar end weight. I don't think he'll be able to open the door without knocking over my bike. I notice the man is wearing earpods and is engrossed in conversation.   \n  \nHe rolls down the window and mutters something at me. I think I recognize the voice.  \n  \nMe:\"Nigel?\"  \n  \nTo be continued.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1670550551.0},{"title":"\"We should have back up hardware at remote locations\" \"No its too expensive\"","author":"redditadmindumb87","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zgmmzj\/we_should_have_back_up_hardware_at_remote\/","text":"Going over some plans with senior management awhile ago I pointed out how our larger locations all had back up hardware that way if a computer goes down we have a computer on site, that is already imaged that all the employee needs to do is log in\/update the software and can be back up and running in a matter of hours instead of days or weeks.\n\nI got told \"no that's too expensive\"\n\nKeep in mind this is a company that over 500 million dollars in revenue, I'm talking about purchasing 7~ laptops at a cost of about $900 a unit so $6,300 and putting them in a closet in those remote locations.

Like many educational institutions, we're currently trying to move as much storage as possible off of Google. (For the uninformed: Google recently ended unlimited storage for education, to the despair of IT and budgeting departments everywhere)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the ways we're doing this is by moving non-Google files out of people's Google drives and into OneDrive. Basically, if you have PDFs, photos, videos, etc. in your drive, they get copied to OneDrive and deleted from Google. We're doing this migration in waves based on the user's primary department (this will be relevant later).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, the story:\n\nJust as I'm about to clock out after a long shift of showing people how to change their passwords, I get a call from someone with one of the centers (basically another type of department) on campus:\n\n~~paraphrasing as this was a few days ago~~\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe - \"Thank you for calling \\[helpdesk\\], my name is literal\\_trahs, could I get your name please?\"\n\nUser - \"Hi, I'm User with \\[center\\] and I have some concerns about the Google drive migration\"\n\nMe, realizing I definitely will not be leaving on time - \"I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have\"\n\nUser - \"So we have a lot of photos and videos stored in Google drive, and I was wondering if the IT department will be automatically mapping the old Google drive links to the new OneDrive links as part of the migration\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I know this person is doing something cursed. There is no sane reason to be accessing so many drive files exclusively by link that you can't update them manually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe - \"Unfortunately that's not something IT has set up right now, but \" - out of foolish hope that they're using drive like a normal person - \" all your folders will be copied to OneDrive, so you should be able to find everything just fine.\"\n\nUser - \"See, we have a database of links to these files, and I'm worried it will stop working when people start getting migrated.\"\n\nMe, resisting the urge to tell them that *obviously it will stop working* and ask why on earth they would do that in the first place - \"So you have a database of drive links to files in your Google drive, and you need them updated once you're migrated to OneDrive?\"\n\nUser - \"Yes, but they're not just in my drive. They're all owned by different people at \\[center\\], so I don't know when they'll be migrated\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll spare you the 5-10 minutes of attempting to understand what *exactly* they were doing, and cut to the chase:\n\nThis center has a dozens of employees across many different departments. They've all been uploading \"very important\" photo and video files to their Google drives with zero organization and just throwing the links in the \"database\" (User never mentioned exactly what it was, and I have a sneaking suspicion it's a spreadsheet) to keep track of them. It is not at all clear why they aren't using one of the *many* storage solutions offered by the university that would achieve the same end result without being so unbelievably cursed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter some stalling to figure out how to say \"you're screwed lmao\" without getting myself in trouble, I told them I'd create a case with the team that's managing the migration. Anticlimactic, I know, but I don't get paid enough to deal with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;Dr - a center (department) has been using a \"database\" of links to photos\/videos stored at random in users' Google drives for god knows how long, and it's about to stop working completely when those files get automatically migrated to OneDrive.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1670574557.0},{"title":"When a user won't respond, but another user tells you to help them","author":"Another_Basic_NPC","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zfeag9\/when_a_user_wont_respond_but_another_user_tells\/","text":"So this happened a few hours ago, and I'm sure some of you might be able to relate. \n\nThe day is getting near the end, and I get a message about a program not working from a user.

I get on a screenshare with him so I can see where it's failing out. The page loads fine and he's filling in the form.

The city itself has ruled I'm not even allowed to help if personal info is involved, especially finances. I do get questions for those departments that I can actually answer, most of the time (what time they open, trash pickup schedules, late return library fees, etc).  \n\nThe main reason my job exists is to field emergency calls, like reports of water coming out of the road, or sending an on-call crew to zip over and turn off someone's water at the meter if they have an uncontrolled leak inside which is causing damage, coordinate crews out in the field with where they need to go, log when they arrived where, and state-related reporting. \n\nHowever, a few callers interpret \"emergency\" as \"I need to take a shower because I'm stinky from work and I have a date,\" to which \"call tomorrow when they're open\" type responses will simply not do and will try to argue the motive behind a rule I didn't come up with (getting your water turned back on due to payment processed is finance-related and disallowed for me). \n\nI've been talking with my supervisor about this together we've crafted a kind of script of how to handle the super special people who just won't accept that I can't help them. One idea of mine was to perfect a very stern enunciation of CORRECT, to answer the zinger they often try to throw out, \"So you're saying this dumpster smelling up my alley can't be picked up today?\" to encompass a tone implying, \"CONGRATULATIONS on somehow stumbling across the entire point of every answer I've given you this whole call.\"\n\nMy supervisor (who often tells me about what she saw on Judge Judy recently, if that tells you anything about her) will sometimes even greet me in passing or at the door of the dispatch office and with a mock-crying, \"So you won't help me today?\" that I can practice it on. Not yelling, just a stern enunciation is the best way I can describe it, laced with a \"Bingo, Sherlock\" backspin.\n\nI finally got to use it yesterday, and the conversation went a little like this. Responses are a little wordier that what I'd normally say, in order to obfuscate certain details, etc. Keep in mind that easily 98% of calls don't go any deeper than 1-2 responses, because they actually let me explain; it's just that this one would simply not accept rejection and kept interrupting.\n\nK: Hi, I just got home, saw the water had been turned off, and paid my bill online. When will you be out  today to turn it back on?\n\nMe: It won't be turned on today if you paid it after 5pm; the department which handles those finances is closed and they have to process it first to send out a tech. This is an emergency line for things like..\n\nK: (interrupts) But my bill is paid. I have the receipt number, and the money shows taken out of my bank!\n\n(My supervisor walks in, grinning because she can hear I got a wild karen calling and is entertained by my refusal to get riled up by them)\n\nMe: The department who handles bill payments, is closed. They will have to process it tomorrow when they return, 8-5. This line is for people who are reporting water coming up out..\n\nK: (interrupts) But I'm speaking to you, now, and you know that it is paid, so you can just send someone out to turn it on now.\n\nMe: But I'm telling you the department which handles that, which is not me, is closed, so it will be processed no sooner than 8am tomorrow.\n\nK: I don't understand why you can't just send someone out to turn it on.\n\nMe: We do not handle billing concerns in any way including turn-ons after payment is made; this is an *e-mer-gen-cy line* for people who are reporting pipe breaks in the road, or if..\n\nK: (interrupts) WELL THIS IS AN EMERGENCY!

I asked to see it before working. It was horrid roach infested non-air conditioned rooms. I told them NO, I am not staying here and I am not starting work until I know where I am staying. A couple of hours and we were offered the executive accommodation, which upon inspection was A.O.K.\n\nWork was interesting as no-one seemed to know how to load the software onto the mainframe. I had never done it before but was like \"How hard can this be?\", we started and I just go stuck in and got it started.\n\nOn return to the accommodation that night we passed a guard post with a guard asleep and a machine gun at his feet, pretty common in some parts of the world I learned latter, but not in Singapore\/Australia\/Japan etc. that I was used to.\n\nAnyway around 3 a.m. I hear gun shots in the distance and this got me keenly aware of just how far out in the boon docks we were.

I am not American but being white I sure looked like one.\n\nI was there for three weeks and thus at weekends went to Manila (2.5 hours back then travel) to the safety of a decent hotel with a mini bar. I drunk the mini bar dry and tried every cocktail on the menu and survived.\n\nOn return to Singapore I asked the CEO if we had kidnap insurance. No, okay I am not returning to IRRI. And thus I was safe.  I worked in Manila several times over the years and like the people who are great, hard working and very welcoming.\n\nThere were a lot of other reasons not to go back but I used the lack of insurance as one and they saved time and money by using me elsewhere.

It's also a big pain in the arse. And I don't just mean having to dig all the chocolate bars out of the deepest depths of your desk drawers, I mean moving all the IT servers and desktops, and getting a working network established in a new building too. This is something that has eased a bit with cloud computing making on-site server rooms less crowded, but depending on the business and the size of said business there might still be a lot of hardware. Cloud is expensive, so if you are running serious IT it's often still cheaper to have it on-site. This story is about a law firm, and to demonstrate how big of a deal moving just a few miles is I'll link to this article about Clifford Chance moving from Canary Wharf (reclaimed dock area in East central London that's now a very fancy business and housing area) to central Londons \"square mile\". They have publiclly announced their move 6 YEARS before they are making it. https:\/\/www.cliffordchance.com\/news\/news\/2022\/11\/clients--people-and-sustainability-at-the-heart-of-new-london-of.html\n\nBut...back in what seems like 5 years ago but is closer to 20 years ago, one of the biggest law firms in the world had their offices in Canary Wharf. Being such a behomouth of a law firm this one took up many floors. I didn't work there, but I was in the sector at a company that worked with a lot of law firms. I can't honestly remember the exact number I was told, and who knows if it was right then, but let's say they took up 12 floors. 12 floors of a building were all one firm. 2 of those floors were just for IT, no doubt with a large portion of it being server rooms, PC build-up areas, etc, and then a whole lot of IT support, maintenance and development staff. IT in law firms is not seen as the \"real work\" of the firm, but is very important for retaining all the history of documents, being able to show the changes between any stages, and most importantly, churning out a document in 30 seconds and billing the client an hour for it.\n\nThen came Accounts. Someone, somewhere, decided they were spending too much money. So a lot of law-area employees were let go and weren't you paying attention? Of course that didn't happen. They do the \"real work\", they need them. It was ITs budget they decided to throw several hand-grenades into. Some wise, sage-like people decided that IT was taking up too much money and too much space, which took up more money. If they could somehow get rid of IT they could let out those 2 floors they took up and save millions of pounds each and every year. This plan was put to the IT board, who pointed out the glaring issues with this plan and started deep discussions and again you should have been paying attention to the tone of this story. I've no idea how well reviewed it was, because the first I heard about it was when they had already let go of the IT department and let the floors out because their IT was now being handled as a service provided by an Indian company. In India. And no, I don't mean East India that's 1 miles away from Canary Wharf. I mean India.\n\nFloors were let to other companies. IT staff were made redundant. Servers were sold. They committed. And I commented. On hearing about this I believe I said \"That's going to be expensive to put right\". Lawyers are, like every group of people, a mixed bag of personalities. But like almost all groupings of people, some traits are more attracted or suited to the group and therefore tend to represent it. I've met more than one laywer who was not really concerned with IT issues. They just need them gone so they can get on with the \"real work\" of making the firm money. You might be able to imagine dealing with that personality on a support call. They aren't the most forthcoming with details on what they did, or patient with trying to diagnose the cause. A lot of the time the solution is to go to their desk and work it out while they go off and do \"real work\". So let's throw in an accent and many thousands of miles between parties so that over the phone is the ONLY way to deal with issues.\n\nShockingly, no body high-enough up predicted that a Partner at a law firm who has a 50% chance of being over 55 and a 50% chance of being a bit drunk if it's past lunch would have a problem with not being able to summon one of those IT people to their office every time they couldn't work out how to open their new laptop (actually happened). Within a matter of months the project was deemed a disaster that needed to be unwound. I imagine the accountant who signed off on this was allowed to leave too.\n\nThe problem was that the other companies who had moved into their new Canary Wharf offices on the vacant floors just a few months ago weren't keen on moving again (see paragraph 1) and decided they would stay. It turns out that retailers that sell servers and network equipment only sell new equipment too, which comes at the New price, which is higher than the value you get for selling off your second-hand servers. But that wouldn't happen until they had someone with a clue as to what to buy, which meant getting IT staff. I imagine some staff went back, but most would have just started a new job. Meanwhile, this law firm is trying to mass-hire 2 floors worth of IT staff and produce cohesive teams. I can't imagine the mess they were in for months to come.\n\nThe net result of this money saving idea was a lot of upheaval, loss of many experienced staff, a huge IT infrastructure bill, and having to rent out whatever office space they could get that was vaguely close to their office, which I can't imagine they got a great deal on. And, after it was all said and done, the distance between IT and a lawyers desk went from a few floors in a lift with your coffee still in hand, to a 10 minute journey on foot between buildings. And I can bet IT were less forthcoming on desks visits in the winter months.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1669996733.0},{"title":"Dad vs Tech: The printer with Wi-Fi","author":"PrutsendePrutser","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zaiqir\/dad_vs_tech_the_printer_with_wifi\/","text":"It's been a long time since I posted here, because no real interesting things have happened at work, but after visiting my family recently I remembered the time when my dad got a new printer, with Wi-Fi. My dad isn't very tech-savvy, but he knows how to google, he knows when something goes over his head, and he takes notes and is able to explain in detail what he's tried, and what the result was. On top of that, he's always grateful for any help, even if the result is the opposite of what he was hoping for. One of the most lovely people I know.\n\nSo it's basically a tech support's dream almost. One time a couple of years ago I see some messages pop up in our family's WhatsApp group. It was my dad, asking if anyone was able to help him with setting up his new printer. I contemplate for a few moments if I should reply, and decide that I don't have enough things I could sacrifice to our printer demon overlords. I'm around 200km (125ish miles) northwest and helping over the phone would be just as hellish.\n\nNobody else replies to my dad's request about his printer, and over the next few days I hear nothing about it. Until I'm traveling back home a couple of days later and I get a direct message from my dad. It's about the printer. And I can't ignore him (or actually, I don't want to) if he asks me directly for help.\n\nI explain to my dad through text messages that I'm most likely unable to help him with the printers, because I don't know that much about hardware. I notice he's typing a message for quite a while, and once he actually sent the message, I just couldn't stop giggling.\n\nMy dad, who thinks he doesn't know a lot about \"that computer tech stuff\" had just explained to me in detail what he had done, step by step. He also sent a crystal clear picture of a paper sheet with the printer settings. He found out how to make the printer spit that out through googling. And then he states that \"it works on both our laptops, but I must have done something wrong\".\n\nAt this point I just start grinning from ear to ear. My dad set up a printer, connected it to his own wireless network, added the printer to both laptops, and it worked perfectly. I'm so proud of my dad. Still slightly confused though, I ask why he felt he was doing something wrong. Turns out a physical CD\/DVD came with the printer, containing some manufacturer software.\n\nOnly one of their laptops had an actual disc drive, so he thought that he must do something with that disc, and the terms the manufacturer used for the wireless hotspot from the printer itself, and the mode where you hook the printer into your own wireless network were almost identical.\n\nTl;dr: Dad asks for help with setting up his new wireless printer. Worked perfectly, dad couldn't believe he would be able to set up a printer all by himself, so surely **something** must be wrong, right?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award(s) kind strangers. I'll make sure to let dad know people enjoyed the story enough to gift some awards!\n\n*Edit 2: Dad is humbled\/shy by the positive reactions. As if he wasn't humble enough already :p He mentioned he should probably set the printer up for their new laptop soon. Told him I'll help if needed, but I'm fairly sure he's going to manage perfectly fine*","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1669978372.0},{"title":"Floppy drives are warped","author":"labrador2020","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/zab1s0\/floppy_drives_are_warped\/","text":"Just read someone\u2019s story from years ago that reminded me of when I first started IT in the late 80\u2019s.\n\nMy first IT job was working for a computer vendor that had Fortune 500 companies as clients.

I worked in a helpdesk role, and was the boots on the ground for a big office. In the office you had any range of employee from a co-op to a partner. One Partner had requested help with a client meeting, no biggie. \n\nI went down early, setup everything, and found him talking to someone on a different level in the office. Mentioned the meeting was good, and he waved me off. A few minutes later, I get notified that the clients are waiting at the elevator to our office (it was locked with covid) and an employee had to go get them, show them to the meeting, and get the partner. I decided to go do this because the partner was still talking, and didn't seem concerned when I let him know. So I let a dozen clients in, got them drinks (bottled water) and got them all seated and left. Some time after the partner did show up, and carried the meeting off no problem. \n\nThe problem was the next meeting the following day. The admin assistant for the partner emailed me telling me I was to do this again, so to setup the meeting, but with the added tasks of waiting for the clients! I was then to get them all (they all don't arrive at the same time) one by one bringing them to the meeting, and helping them with drinks. We then had our usual IT stand up, and I casually mentioned I was being told to be a door greeter. My boss told me to forward him the email, and about 10 minutes later I was cc'd on an email from the assistant. \n\n\"It looks like x can no longer be our door greeter, we'll have to find someone else\" For the record, it was HER job to do all of this, but she was working from home instead of coming in.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1669907928.0},{"title":"Tech Support prevents a mental breakdown","author":"anh86","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/z9v6rb\/tech_support_prevents_a_mental_breakdown\/","text":"I used to support a pretty complex database querying and reporting tool for non-profit donor management. It was powerful but quirky and not intuitive, you really had to know what you were doing to make useful things happen. Unfortunately, finances are tight at most non-profits which means unpaid or underpaid (and totally unqualified) people are sitting at the computer trying to make useful things happen.\n\nAs a support analyst, I can fix something broken, explain how a feature works, explain why a feature doesn't work the way a customer thinks it will, direct them to a starting point if totally lost but I cannot (and should not) do the whole job for them. \n\nOne day I get a call from a young woman and she is totally frazzled. She's up against a deadline and doesn't have the first clue as to how this software works. She's not angry (a welcome change) but she's anxious and upset about having this responsibility which is far outside her wheelhouse. I direct her to the features of the software that will accomplish her task and begin to explain that until she is actually running into a problem, that's as far as I can take her. At this point she completely breaks down crying. Between sobs she says that she understands and begins to move the conversation toward ending the call. So now suddenly I feel terrible and realize I can't leave the call like this so in a complete reversal of my prior stance, I ask if it would be helpful for us to go over a few things on a screenshare. Once on the screenshare, I ask what she's trying to report on. I build the query for her and run reports based on our query. I do everything except press the print button. Expressing more relief than I've heard from another human before or since, she thanks me and the conversation ends.\n\nLater that day, she emails my manager directly (must have gotten it from her account rep, don't know how else she would have known who I reported to) and lays out a massive list of terrible things she'd been going through that day and week. She said she isn't sure she could have taken even one more thing and wasn't sure what she would have done had our call not gone differently. That was five years ago, I've never forgotten it and will never forget it.

Until Rons phone started ringing, a call beeing redirected directly from the boss, usually not a good sign. As soon as he picks up the phone he hears a familiar voice. Its C-IT-DM complaining that their email-server is not working after C-IT1 serviced it on Friday afternoon. Ron takes a quick look in the system and it shows the server as offline, so he askes to be conected to C-IT1 to figure out whats going on and to troubleshoot. First question Ron asked was : *Is the server plugged in and powered on ?* C-IT1 says *yes it is* , and after some more troubleshooting and questions Ron asks C-IT1 to send someone down to the server to check if the server is acctually plugged in and turned on. After some forth and back C-IT1 finaly agrees to sending C-IT2 down to the server to check. A few minutes later the answer comes back from the serverroom and says : *Server is not showing any lights and does nothing when flicking the powerswitch.*  Ron not wanting to go on a 4h driver across country to the customer asks C-IT2 to go back down and check all the cables and then try powering it on again. C-IT2 is already on lunchbreak by know but luckily C-IT3 picks up the phone and though muttering does as asked. After about an hour comes the callback from C-IT3 comes in : *Server still not powering on all cables on the server seem alright.* Well shit . Ron now was told the server was plugged in 3 times and is still not turning on, so he grabs a replacement server and some cables and drives to the customer due to traffic-jams he arrives after about 5h . C-IT-DM greets him at the gate and leads him straight tot he server-room. After 5 seconds of checking the cables Ron notices that yes all cables are plugged into the server but then notices : Wait a second where does the powercable of the server go ?  After carefully moving 2 other servers aside he finds the other end of the cable just loose on the ground. Turns out no one ever bothered to check the other end of the cable. Plugs it in , server is up and running within 5 minutes.   \n \n\nThe aftermath : Pretty high bill for the customer and a pretty mad Ron .  \n So Ron talked to his boss and now they got a new Policy: If they have to drive out to a customer and the issue is something a customer already said they checked an extra charge of 100$ will be applied known within the company as the Idiot-tax maby it will teach them maby it will not.

Wording is not exact because my memory isn't the best. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm probably bad at writing this as a good story, in the future maybe I'll get some beter tales. \n\nContext:\n\nA few years ago, I did some work at a school, basically just doing all around tech support. \n\nStory:\n\nSo I got a ticket from one of the chemistry teachers for a display that wouldn't connect. The school used screenbeams, basically a remote display device. (Though I personally hate them, they're unreliable and die randomly).\n\nMe: Hey I'm here to look at your screenbeam\n\nTeacher (in thick accent): yes yes the projector isn't working\n\nI made sure the projector input is right, that everything is on, and confirms the \"connect to device\" screen isn't even appearing. \n\nMe: It looks like your screenbeam is broken, I'll run downstairs and grab a replacement. \n\nI went down to the tech office and grabbed a replacement, and imaged it with the same name and password as the old one, then go back upstairs. The password was {4 digits used to identify school}{3 digit room number}{random number}, lets say 6326 220 2\n\nMe: Okay, I'm going to swap out your screenbeam now. \n\nTeacher: It doesn't work anyway, my screen turns off when I connect. \n\nMe, internally: Well shit this'll be interesting. \n\nMe, to the teacher: Well I'll switch out the screenbeam and then I'll take a look at that. \n\nI switched out the screenbeam, basically just needed to unplug power and hdmi from the old one and plug it into the new one. \n\nMe: Okay can you connect to the screenbeam now? \n\nShe opens her laptop and presses the keystrokes to bring up the windows \"connect to display\" menu. (Luckily thats well enough trained into everyone that they remember), and clicks on the old one, it dissapears, and with a little bit of prompting, she manages to click on the right one. \n\nTeacher: Ma'am, what is the password here? \n\nMe: The password is six three two six, *long pause*, two two zero, *long pause*, two\n\nThe teacher then pressed connect, and it connected, and true to her word, the display on her laptop went black, as if it had just transfered to the screenbeam, not using the local display at all. \n\nTeacher: Ma'am the screen is dead, see. \n\nMe: Oh yes it is, can I go change a setting to make it work again?\n\nTeacher: Yes, you know the students always changing settings on my laptop. \n\nMe: *thinking noises* (as the students also had laptops of their own) \n\nI decided to ignore that, and just fix it, and attempted to ask her whether she wanted it set to duplicate or extend. \n\nMe: So do you want the same thing to show up on both? Or do you want to be able to show something different to the students? \n\nTeacher: Can you make it display?\n\nI had to show her both of the options, and she ended up wanting it on duplicate. \n\nTeacher: Thank you you are goddess..... Oh by the way when i draw on the whiteboard, things appear on the doccument. \n\nMe: *blinks* What? \n\nTeacher: If I have something open on the adobe, and I draw here, it appears on the doccument\n\nMe: Ummmmmm okayyyyyy, can you show me? \n\nShe couldn't get it to happen, so I appologized and said if she had it happen again, to open a ticket. Just as I was about to leave I got:\n\nTeacher: Oh Ms. Transorsmth, my printer broken too.\n\nI slowly turned around, figured out where the printer was, and went over to it. There was a paper jam in it, that it looks like someone had tried to fix, but instead ripped off the sheet of paper. Luckily I was able to get an edge of it between 2 fingers and pull it out. The printer screen was still showing an issue, so I pressed buttons til it told me it was out of paper. \n\nI told the teacher that I had fixed it, but was going to get more paper for it, got some and loaded it up, finally the printer fault light went off, and it started spitting out sheets of paper from whatever the last job was. It was some image tiny on a paper, in black and white. I couldn't tell what it was, and because the printer had broken the day before, canceled the job. \n\nMe: Okay I fixed the printer. \n\nTeacher: Thank you you are godsend, okay class everyone thank Ms. Transorsmth. \n\nAbout a quarter of the class actually said it, and they said it out of sync, and I escaped from that room before she could have me fix something else.

We provided free telephone tech support for our customers. We also provided computer repair services for pretty reasonable prices if someone wanted to bring their PC in.\n\nOccasionally, we would get a non-customer calling for help with their PCs. Strictly speaking, we weren't supposed to provide free support. But if the end user caught one of us in a good mood, we would usually attempt to help them. At least in a limited fashion. And we always had the option of falling back on \"well, we'd really have to see the PC in order to diagnose this further\" to get out of the call.\n\nOne day I had a pleasant sounding older gentleman call in. He was having issues saving a Word document to floppy disk. I told him that this isn't the sort of thing that we would generally help with over the phone. But because he was so pleasant I told him that I was willing to give it a go.\n\nThe info I got from him was that he had a Word doc on a floppy disk. He opened the file and deleted a few words or sentences from the document. Then when he tried to save the file back to the disk, he was getting an error.\n\nAfter a bit of troubleshooting, I determined that the floppy disk was full. Or at least full enough that the document no longer fit on the disk. I explained to him what the issue was and that he would need to delete some files from the disk or simply save the document to a new disk. Keep in mind that this took place during the early 2000s so floppy disks were crazy cheap, think $5 for a 10 pack. So, using a 2nd disk wouldn't break anybody's bank.\n\nThis person was not having my answer. At this point, he was no longer a pleasant sounding gentleman. He first turned stern. He demanded to know how deleting something from a document could possibly make the file bigger. I told him I didn't really know but could only speculate. All I could tell him for certain was that his disk was full, and he needed a new disk. But this answer was not acceptable to him. Now he turned angry.\n\nTo this day, I'm not sure what he thought was going on. But he acted as if I was causing this thing to happen to him. That I was perhaps hiding some secret info from him just to make things difficult? Maybe this was some sort of conspiracy against him? He continued to demand an answer to how this could possibly happen. And I kept repeating that I wasn't sure why the file got bigger and simply using a new, blank, CHEAP disk would solve the problem entirely. But I was getting nowhere with him.\n\nFinally, I explained to him that I wasn't even supposed to provide this sort of support over the phone and had only done it out of the goodness of my heart. And I told him that we'd need to see the floppy disk to do any further troubleshooting. And that this troubleshooting would be billed at $57 an hour. OR, he could buy another 50 cent floppy disk.\n\nAnd that is when I hung up the phone. Fortunately, he didn't call back. Unfortunately (or fortunately, I suppose) he never brought that floppy disk in to get checked out.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1669823483.0},{"title":"Lord Job Application the 166th","author":"zettaxy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/z8pce3\/lord_job_application_the_166th\/","text":"I work L1 support for a company, but I do a bunch of the L2 duties because If I just sit there resetting passwords all day I'm just going to fall asleep.\n\nA typical day handling the phone queue is mostly simple IT work like resetting passwords or clearing out registry keys because someone got a temp profile while signing into windows, so something like the following stands out.\n\nI think we'd already gotten a few calls from this guy, every time, we would escalate to another department, because we don't really support \\{EmployeePortal\\} beyond password resets, but that other department is so understaffed that their ticket queue looks like a hurricane went through it. However, he kept calling, we would always point to the same ticket, and let him know what the situation was.\n\nOne day he got particularly angry about how long the issue had been pending. I mean, I don't blame him, but at the same time, his issue was just not being able to apply to an internal position, something that would obviously not be very high in the priority list for a department so small. What we did was we reached out to the absolute warrior over at that department, \\{Luke\\}\n\nNow, \\{Luke\\} did not really have time for this, but we just wanted to give \\{Lord Job\\} some information, and since I already do some of the L2 work, I got to speak with him directly, and explain tbe situation. What I report back to the team is incredible:\n\n\\{Luke\\} tells me that \\{EmployeePortal\\} is not a very well written application, but regardless, the issue was mostly on the user. Turns out \\{Lord Job\\} was a rehire, and when his information was re-entered, his personal info had a typo, it was off by a digit, so when he would enter it to apply to an open position, the system would throw an error as of course, it didn't match.\n\nNow, that was resolved quickly once we told him to contact HR, so we thought we wouldn't hear from him again. But, things aren't like that as you all know, so the day after HR fixed the information, \\{Lord Job\\} called back saying that now he wouldn't get the error, but the page would load for 30 minutes then give ANOTHER error.\n\n\\{Luke\\} must have seen the ticket pop back in his queue and wondered what the hell was going on, since he responded in around two days, something that's unheard of for an issue of this type. Finally, we get to the title of this post. Turns out, when the application was written, it looks like the developers did not account for someone entering their information, receiving an error, then proceeding to attempt another... say, 165 times?\n\n\\{Lord Job\\} had applied ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SIX times, and \\{EmployeePortal\\} being as fantastic as it is, kept a record each time, regardless of the fact that \\{Lord Job\\} had not technically applied. This time around, since \\{Lord Job\\} had submitted so many applications, the portal would attempt to display all **166** applications, which would cause it to crash on his end.\n\n\\{Luke\\} must have let out a very frustrated sigh, cleared out all that garbage, and then sent the ticket our way to validate with \\{Lord Job\\}\n\nWe give him a call, and he says he was finally able to apply.\n\nEDIT: I'd like to clarify a couple things:\n1) {Lord Job} was never rude to us at any point, in fact, he was calm about the issue and only got frustrated once because it'd been so long, the issue took about a month to be sorted out.\n2) This post is meant to poke fun at how ridiculous this situation is, particularly how we got to the point that 166 applications were submitted and recorded, even though the information provided did not match. {Lord Job} only faced this issue because of a typo, and the role posted clearly meant a lot to him.

The biggest being that, a particular job having already started, the integrity of the data could not be completely guaranteed until that job and several others finished in a few hours. Less critically, it would have made a mess of the schedule for the upgrade work.)\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I can't help you. We sent out plenty of notices of the early shutdown.\"\n\n\"Oh, I never read those!\"\n\nAt this point I turned rigidly polite and tried to end the conversation as quickly - while being rigidly polite - as I could. Rigidly politely. Did I mention that I was rigidly polite?\n\nAbout 45 minutes later my boss came to talk to me. Wanted to hear my side of that conversation. So I told her.\n\nAnd then she congratulated me on having handled the situation perfectly.\n\nApparently I was *too* polite, and Lady had gone to *her* boss to complain about me. And told him the whole story.\n\nAnd he was... let's say... a bit less polite than I had been. Something about paying attention to internal communications with subject lines such as \"Early shutdown Friday\". Also placing the entire fault for the lady's work not being done on schedule, on *her.*\n\nAnd then called my boss to compliment me for not blowing up at her myself - which it wasn't my place to do.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1669772390.0},{"title":"\"The Enter key?\"","author":"agent_smith_3012","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/z7zpvs\/the_enter_key\/","text":"I have a dear old lady client whom used to be a coworker.

I work for a small MSP serving about a hundred small to medium-sized businesses.  I've followed this sub for a while and have been enjoying the stories, so I wanted to contribute one.\n\nI'm at work today, busy on a project the boss said has to be done this week.  His words Monday morning were \"don't do anything else this week, just work on this project.\"  So my head's down, I'm plowing through this project, I'm not going out of my way to grab other tickets.  But as I suspected, both the boss and office manager are occasionally assigning me other tickets.  I take it in stride and quickly knock them out before returning to my task.  But again, I'm mostly ignoring other new tickets unless they are related to the project I'm working on.\n\nI successfully failed to see this specific monitoring alert come in:  \"An account failed to log on\".  Two hours go by.\n\nBoss asks if any of us techs (there are 3 of us, including myself) have helped this lady who's login failure triggered the alert.  No one had.  I dig past a few other alerts to find what he's talking about since I'd totally missed this.  I find it and it's for a user from a client of ours I hadn't dealt with before.  This lady is the only user I see for this business.   Small client, but one of our clients.  I look back at the alert details, and it showed it was a failed login from her PC, not somewhere in, I don't know, Bulgaria.  Doesn't look like a security risk or that she got locked out from too many failed attempts.\n\nI'm sure many of you know, this is a fairly common occurrence to see the occasional failed login.  People make mistakes.  I find it odd my boss cared so much about this.  Even if I'd seen it earlier, I wouldn't have thought much of it.  This alert SHOULD only trigger after 15 failures in a short period of time, but I know Windows likes to generate multiple events at a time just for a single login interaction.  She probably doesn't even need help, but I offer to call her because we're all busy, not just me, and I can spare some bandwidth.\n\nSo I call her.  She picks up and I say,  \"Good afternoon, this is $ME from $YOUR_MSP.  Our monitoring system alerted us that your account failed to login earlier, so we're just checking in to make sure you can get in.\"\n\nShe doesn't even recognize our company name at first as I state my name, business and reason for calling, and simply asks, \"you're with who?\"\n\nNow, I've been in customer facing roles long enough to know the difference between good and bad phone etiquette.  I often call clients who don't know me personally, and some of them don't have much of a relationship with our MSP company outside of coming to us to setup a few basic services.  After setup, they pay the monthly fee, and almost never call us.  Anyway, I always make a point to be clear about who I am and why I'm calling, but I don't know why I'm surprised at this lady's listening skills.  I repeat myself to her with almost no variation, hoping it'll click the second time.  It did.  \n\nShe says she hasn't had any login issues today.  Figures.  I'm relieved that we can wrap this up, and  I say, \"okay that's good, we just wanted to check in and make sure.  Thanks for your time, I'll letcha go.\"\n\nThen she's like, \"oh but wait while I have you... I don't know if something changed with Quickbooks and where things are saved but I've been meaning to call you guys about it.\"\n\nBy the time she's finished, I've already got her PC pulled up and I'm one click away from remote access.  I wanted to get this over with.\nI say, \"ok, do you mind if I connect to your PC so you can show me the issue?\"\n\nShe says, \"yes, yes!  Oh wait... NO, NO!  What is your name again and why are you calling me to get access to my PC?\"\n\n*facepalm* my bluntness meter is slowly filling.\n\n\"I'm $ME.  From your IT service provider.  $YOUR_MSP.  You asked me to help you with Quickbooks.  But if you don't want help, that's fine.\"\n\n\"Uhhh wait.  Can you tell me something from my bill?\"\n\nI wasn't sure if I'd heard that correctly and said, \"I'm sorry, I might have misheard you.  Could you please repeat that?\"\n\n\"Tell me some information that would be on my bill.  \n To confirm who you are?  Can you tell me something from my bill?\"\n\nIf she only knew how much I didn't even want to get on her PC.   I decided the fully blunt approach would be my next move as I responded with \"No, I cannot.  I'm a network engineer and I fix things when they break.  I don't do any of the billing.  $OFFICE_MANAGER does the billing and sends you the invoices\".  I'm half expecting her to ask for the office manager or the boss.\n\nInstead, she seemed to just want to get off the phone and said, \"Well... okay, I'll just call back if I need help.\"\n\nI shrug and tell her to have a nice day and whatnot.  *Click*\n\nI mutter \"Thank God\" to myself after hearing her end the call.

But I still don't think I was entirely unreasonable. We've deployed MDM for company devices and BYOD as the biggest change, and alongside there are several projects going with less end user impact but a lot of work for our IT department which includes me. That's the backdrop of the story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe tale itself starts with, a ticket. It was sent in via e-mail and picked up by our Topdesk crawler. The subject was  \"Logging in\" And the body of the e-mail was:   \n\"Logging in has changed\".\n\nAnd that's the whole thing. Nothing else, no screenshots, no hints, no mirre-accompanied prayers to the IT gods just \"Logging in has changed.\"\n\nWell this is strange because though we had a lot of projects going on I couldn't remember anything that should have affected the login procedure for any workstation or Chromebook. Yet this ticket clearly says that logging in has changed somehow.\n\nOh and it also didn't say what the problem was, like at all. So I wracked my brain for as long as I could, which was, considering the not inconsiderable mountain of tickets still waiting for my attention and I replied to the user: \n\n\"Could you tell me what your question is regarding the login procedure?\" and set the ticket to *awaiting user imput'* before going on with my day and putting the whole thing out of my mind. Normally tickets that get this status eventually get imput from the user bringing them back to my attention.\n\nBut not this one. It sat in my queue for two weeks without anything and then, vanished. The user closed the ticket. Which is really really rare, but because I wasn't seeing it and there were dozens of other tickets going by, I didn't notice it either.\n\nUntil yesterday when I walked past the user by chance. She started irate, asking if we had standard automated emails we sent out to users who entered tickets.\n\nI told her the only automated emails were the ones where we confirmed the opening and closing of a ticket, all other emails required our own imput, which was when she started tearing up, not crying, but I knew that, if I wasn't careful I'd have her bawling her eyes out. So I put the verbal kiddy gloves on and start figuring out why she's so upset.\n\nShe shows me the ticket, which has her notification that her login has changed. And my question where I asked her to tell me what her question was regarding this login change.\n\nShe starts to explain that she can't explain what's changed, just that she used to get a prompt for 2fa on her phone and now she has to use SMS verification when she wants to login... And that we couldn't ask questions that she couldn't answer.\n\nHer phone had a sync error that disallowed the prompt to be used, so I reset that for her and just, walked away.\n\nMaybe in my next ticket I'll ask the user what their major malfunction is. Because if any questions from the servicedesk are wrong, I might as well get some memorable movie quotes in.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1669791682.0},{"title":"Everyone Sucks Here: Network Maintenance and \u201cNo Appointments Scheduled\u201d","author":"LukeCH2015","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/z85rcj\/everyone_sucks_here_network_maintenance_and_no\/","text":"Context, I work for an outpatient mental healthcare provider, which operates three separate offices in our service area.

This is nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nI was also told by there would be network upgrades happening at the satellite office and we should expect some network downtime. Cool thanks for the heads-up. \n\nI arrived at the office this morning and start working on my cabling project.\n\nThe clock hits 11AM and roughly 4 employees come find me in the back room to tell me that their internet isn\u2019t working.  I confirm that network maintenance is happening and unfortunately, there may be inconsistent coverage for the time being.  The users were not happy with this response and as I found out more I didn\u2019t blame them. \n\nI reached out to my coworkers back at our main office conveying the staff\u2019s irritation, and it slowly becomes clear that the following happened in the lead up to this network maintenance.\n\nA clinical manager had been working with our SysAdmin to find an optimal time during which to schedule the network maintenance and downtime. This manager had suggested 11am-2pm on Tuesday because according to the available schedule, no appointments had been arranged in the clinical rooms during this period.\n\nIt evidently did not occur to this woman, that the office would not be closed, and that staff would still be on-site and require the use of our network resources during this period of a f-ing Tuesday, especially so soon after returning from four days off for the Thanksgiving holiday and weekend.\n\nOur SysAdmin took this woman at her word, and made the assumption that she would take it upon herself to inform her staff of the planned network outage. She did not inform her staff ahead of time, and no one on our team in IT had the thought to send a blast email to the affected users to prepare alternative working arrangements. No one had adequate warning or lead time to prepare.\n\nWe, that is to say I was able to provide users with mobile 4G Wi-Fi hotspots to tide them over, until our service was restored around 1PM.

Got hired on a Friday, expected to be onsite a few hundred miles away by Monday, despite first interviewing with them a month ago.   \n  \n  \"I' like a company with a looooong hiring practice and a shoooooort deadline.  \n    \nI sing the rest of the Cake song as I ride my motorcycle to the client site. Long trips on a motorcycle lend to singing. Thankfully nobody else can hear me.  I've got a few more hours before I get to my hotel. This trip will be two days for introductions and whiteboarding, then home to work remotely for the rest of the engagement. \n\nI'm doing the security thing as a part of a bigger, multi- consulting firm project which resembles a city park pigeon feeding frenzy- a bunch of rotund, grey creatures loudly squabbling over a scattering of sustenance in bleak surroundings.   \n  \n  I'm not too proud to grab some stale bread crust for myself, though.   \n  \n  Tonight's destination is a scabby Hampton Inn. I'll be here two days, I tell myself. I bathe and fall asleep, skipping dinner.  \n    \n  The next morning, I throw on a suit, hit a convenient Waffle House, then ride carefully to the BigCorp regional offices, in a nicely landscaped office park.  \n    \nLooking at the other company names on the signage, all I see are no-name startups and those odd public-private organizations trying to get a tech company to build in their rust-belt valley. This office park was brought to you by Richard Florida quoting cargo cultists and third generation back-slapping pols, so it's half graft and half hipster chic.. It has both an unused Ultimate Frisbee field and desgnated motorcycle parking.  \n  \nUp front, too. I feel seen. I back my bike into one of the spots. As I get off the bike, I do a little dance to celebrate parking like a king. My ride parks safe in one of the eight spots. A celeste-green Vespa and a handsomely weathered [BMW \/7](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BMW_R100) share the area. \n  \n  I make my way in the long, sprawling office building. It's a bunch of enclosed offices off a central, wide atrium hallway. Arched glass roof and exposed painted metal frameworks places this building in the mid 1990s, an attempt to make an office park look like a hip mall from the 80s.   \n    \n I check in with the receptionist and get to hang out in the waiting room\/lobby. I'm now in the functional gray fabric cube maze. Familiar territory for a consultant. \n   \nA few minutes in and Squirrel shows up. Squirrel has a government name, I'm sure, but I can only remember him as Squirrel. He chatters away and has that odd 'freeze and stare' reflex from time to time. \n  \nSquirrel's both apologizing to me for something and relaying his position in the IT heirarchy here at GreyGoo. He radiates enough insecurity to make me squint.\n  \nDespite GrayGoo's generic web page, they're the middleman you've never heard of in a few industries. For complicated reasons, a significant amount of sensitive data flows through them. Outside of the occasional NPR pledge-drive shout-out, you'd never know their name.   \n  \n  But they know you. Someone you trust trusts them. \n  \nGreyGoo's trying to do a bunch of things at the same time- migrate to the cloud, launch a few new products and fix a few security problems. Each of these is being run by a different consulting firm. These can either be showcases of professionalism or passive-aggressive spatula fights.   \n  \nI don't care, it's all billable.  \n  \n  Squirrel stops and points at a chair in a bullpen mostly full of younger, more casually dressed people with headsets.  \n    \n    Squirrel:\"We're running low on space, so I'm putting you here with the Help Desk\"  \n      \n\n  \n  I have just enough time to stow my gear, work the coffee machine and find a chair in a largish conference table. Wishful thinking and lies by omission are relayed to us via PowerPoint decks for three hours.  \n    \nI have learned that I'm on two tasks:  \n  \n  1. I'll be managing our teams of pentesters in their attempts to poke holes in GrayGoo's defenses.  \n  \n2. There's a project to assess physical security at their sattelite offices.  \n      \nI walk back to my bullpen digs. A handful of of headset wearing folks lean back and take stock of the middle aged suit wearing douchebag.  \n  \nme:\"Hey, folks. It's been a while since I've worked help desk\"  \n  \nNot a smile. This is goung to be a tough audience.  \n  \nWhile checking through an hour's worth of administrativa, I hear the usual patter of a help desk:  \n  \n\"no, not your _personal_ password to Gmail, the one we gave you\"  \n  \n\"$Local_Sports_Team is a disappointment, as usual.\"  \n    \n\"No, you can't edit that email you just sent outside the company\"  \n  \n\"I'm going to quit this shit once my crypto recovers\"   \n  \n\"Printers do that\"   \n  \nMy email dings. Seems I'm being invited to a meeting where I get to defend a penetration test report. I gather from the people invited and the agenda, some program manager isn't happy with some findings and wants to re-litigate severity and scope.  \n  \n  \nI guess I should _read_ the report before I explain it. There are a few different ways to read a [penetration test report](https:\/\/github.com\/juliocesarfort\/public-pentesting-reports). Nontechnical people start at the beginning, lulled by the short, simple statements in the executive summary sandwiched between pretty graphs. IT Operations and developers jump to the Critical and High findings to see if they're going to be called on the carpet. This is cheating, like starting at Daltrey's scream in Won't Get Fooled Again.  \n  \nI start with the harder choices- the Mediums. If the Mediums are scarier than usual, the writers of the report wanted to downplay the findings. If they're not particularly awful, the writers just picked a few Lows and promoted them to see fairer. These are some scary Mediums, which tells me that GreyGoo doesn't actually _like_ being told their baby is ugly.   \n  \nI take stock of my situation. I'm at a help desk at a client that would rather have me shut up and smile.

Real thicc data. Exabytes of the stuff. Honestly we have a bit of a problem. I\u2019m pretty sure our execs snort lines of crushed up data instead of just doing cocaine like all the normal millionares. \n\nWhile they\u2019re up in their tower huffing whatever comes out the other end of a 400G network cable, we have to actually figure out how to make sense of the mess. Anyone can collect data. But cleaning it, aggregating it, and turning it into something meaningful is an art. And yes, it is an art. It\u2019s subjective, open to interpretation, and two teams with the exact same group of datasets will produce widely diverging results depending on how they process it. Point is, doing big data right is hard.\n\nPart of doing it right is testing the quality of these enormous datasets and the tooling we build to process it. On this particular day I was setting up a test for uniqueness on one of our larger datasets. We had changed the hash function used to index our records. The test itself was simple - generate a hash based on the data, and compare hashes to make sure no two hashes matched. If we had any duplicate hashes, it would output all the matching hashes along with the original data so I could see if there was a collision or if someone had put a duplicate row into the dataset. Some idiot on the engineering team (me) had been using a dummy hash function while setting up the test harness and forgot to swap it out for the real thing. The dummy code returned a simple XOR of the data with a max entropy of 8 bits. \n\nProduction data was a few billion rows and processing would take a while, so the doofus on the engineering team (me) kicked off the test job on Friday before logging out for the weekend. Sunday night, I started seeing alerts from our monitoring system flooding in. I sent up a quick prayer for both the on-call and whatever poor sod on the engineering team was responsible for the mess (again, me). I thought nothing more of it and ate a nice steak dinner while enjoying the remainder of my weekend.  \n\nOn Monday, I come in to find that everything stopped over the weekend. Virtual machines, network services, serverless compute, databases : all of it went offline. I got to my desk, jumped on a call and began the arduous process of working together with everyone to get my teams\u2019s portion of services back online.\n\nSlowly, details trickle in from Infra with the investigation of the outage. A runaway script had consumed an ungodly amount of compute and storage, and since everything was hosted in the cloud instead of running out of space it just ran up the bill. One of the global billing monitors for the entire subscription had tripped, triggering a shutdown of all services. \n\nAfter we restored services, I got back to my tasks from the previous week. The output file from my job on Friday wasn\u2019t there, even though the job was marked as completed. As I dug into the logs, I saw to my utter astonishment it had written out enough data to give our entire c-suite a contact high off the fumes. Now I was nervous.\n\nA quick review of my code revealed the error. My dummy hash function caused caused the program to erroneously detect nearly everything as duplicate data. It then happily output all the duplicates it thought it saw, which was nearly everything. It did this for each individual record, resulting  in a number of output rows roughly square relative to the input. The final file was roughly 8 petabytes. I\u2019ll leave as an exercise to the reader how much that would cost to store in Azure. All I\u2019ll say is that infra\u2019s automatic billing shutoff was a last-line defense to extreme cost overruns. \n\nThankfully the fallout was minimal since it was a stupid but innocent error. As a punishment, I received a slap on the wrist from my manager. My \u201cpunitive\u201d task was being made to design and implement changes to our infrastructure so runaway test jobs couldn\u2019t consume endless resources, as well as separating out billing for test and prod. Honestly, my manager\u2019s manager probably had it worse since they had to go to the c-suite and ask for more operations budget. \n\nI\u2019d love to say there was a lesson here, but I can\u2019t find one. We didn\u2019t learn anything new. We just didn\u2019t put up guardrails until someone drove the truck off the proverbial cliff. \n\nIf anything, seeing my boss actually have my back was the biggest lesson here. I know through the grapevine there was a lot of kerfuffle about the extra spending, but I never felt the impact personally.  \n\nTL;DR\n\nMonkey summons n-squared typewriters.

Posting on mobile so trying to be brief and excuse the typos. Coworker (and friend) in this story is \u201cM.\u201d\n\nM had been complaining off and on about internet in her home. M\u2019s husband is a therapist and has been doing everything virtual since Covid. Some days the connection is really bad, he resorts to tethering to his phone. M also has to login to work and use Citrix (to create a session) and she was complaining of constant freezing and lag. If the two try to do something together, forget about it. This is despite paying for a speed that is I believe 400 or 600 MBPs.\n\nI never got involved, she knows I know about tech and had asked me what router to get a few years ago so I had recommended the Google Wi-Fi Mesh routers, but never specifically asked me to look into this\u2026 yet. Also, should be noted, M told me she had a long narrow home so I told her to position all 3 units on the main floor and it would get to the second floor and basement without issue. I didn\u2019t understand why M and her husband was having issues.\n\nCut to a few weeks ago when M texts me about how the company (rhymes with TomLast) sent a guy over who looked at the line going to the house and in the house and said nothing wrong on their end and that she will have to get an \u201cofficial\u201d modem, rather than one she bought herself, because hers is no longer supported. Sounds familiar right? So she was asking me which modem to get.\n\nI asked her to do a Speedtest using the Google Home app. It\u2019s like 450Mbps. Obviously modem and subsequently the main router is getting great speeds. I explain to her that the issue isn\u2019t the modem but it\u2019s strange her connection is so bad, so we agreed to do a FaceTime session later at night when our respective kids go to sleep. \n\nSo we get on FaceTime and I ask her to give me a tour of where her routers are. (I\u2019ve never been to her house). The modem and main router is in the very front of the home\u2026. Inside an entertainment center. I tell her she is greatly diminishing her internet speeds by putting the router inside the unit rather than letting it sit on top. So she moves that out. \n\nThen onto unit two. It turns out the house isn\u2019t as long as I has thought and the second unit is in the dining room which is maybe 10-12 feet away\u2026 in the corner\u2026 under a giant buffet table made of solid wood. Yeah, move that up M. And take me to the third unit.\n\nThe third unit is another 10 ft away, laterally, and is placed underneath a large and heavy sofa. Yes move that up too.\n\nWe discussed how all these objects and corner placement was hurting the radio signal being sent out. She walked up to floor 2 where her husband\u2019s office was and now the speeds were over 250Mbps. Success. She did sort of get angry at herself, saying she should\u2019ve realized that this was a factor she just didn\u2019t realize it could be such a large factor, she said. \n\nI asked her for an update a few days later and she said they haven\u2019t had any issues since moving things up and out. I understand the TomLast agent didn\u2019t look at the satellite routers but he did come in and see the modem and the main router unit, but never suggested moving it out of the entertainment unit. Maybe that person is more of a line expert and not as knowledgeable about home wifi issues. \n\nAnyway a simple fix, move the router up and let it spread its wings.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1669523219.0},{"title":"Old Yeller 2","author":"Thomas-C","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/z4y5xu\/old_yeller_2\/","text":"This was shortly after I started working at the bar for smart people, after having done sales.  I was having a pretty good time, I very much prefer fixing things and at this time the attitude was more about doing that than about hawking more phones at people.  My next appointment was ready, and the customer was coming up, a tall, older man with something wrapped in a trash bag, cradled in his arms.\n\nHe unfurled the bag, and pulled from it, another bag.  Then he unfurled that bag, and in a ziploc was an ipad with a hole in it.  He set the ziploc'd device down on the bar and explained to me what happened.\n\nHe had been trying to get an email password reset but, at least if I understood right, genuinely got caught in a dumb loop of things because he once had a different authentication method he no longer knew.  As he was experiencing that the iPad itself started to behave strangely - some garbled graphics, unresponsive screen, turned black and came back, seemed like it was having a pretty rough time.\n\nBy this point he was so frustrated, he walked outside with the iPad and his pistol, and shot it.  To \"put it out of its misery\".  He was there to see if it was possible to do an exchange because it was still in warranty.\n\nNow, this left me in a pretty conflicted position.  On the one hand, no, shooting your iPad is not covered by the warranty.  On the other, the guy shot his iPad because he was frustrated.  Didn't seem like a great idea to do something frustrating in that moment.   I decided on a compromise:  I would ask my manager.\n\nI took the bagged iPad to the back, and approached my manager.  She looked at the bag, looked at me, and then looked back at the bag.  \n\n\"Did he?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And he expects us to-\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\nI waited a bit, so folks could look at it.\n\nThen I went back out front, set the bag down at the bar and calmly told the man there wasn't a way for us to make a warranty claim work.  I did my best to frame it in a very particular way - we totally tried to see whatever loophole could let us but there just wasn't a way around the fact this was deliberate damage, which meant we could not accept it for an exchange.  He'd have to buy a new one if he wanted one.\n\nThe man smiled and shook his head.  \"Yeah,\" he said, sighing, \"I kinda figured.  Dunno till you take the shot though, gotta at least try and see.\"  He took the bag and asked what he could do with it.  I said there was a place down the road that recycles electronics, they might not take it in person but there was a drop-off box around the side nobody hangs around.  He said he appreciated the help and offered a handshake.\n\nI shook his hand and when I did I felt something.  He did an awkward motion with his fingers, making sure that something stayed in my hand.  As he turned and walked out, I saw I was $50 richer and put it in my wallet.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1669437497.0},{"title":"Tech Support That Saved Christmas","author":"Intelligent_Body21","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/z4v7fu\/tech_support_that_saved_christmas\/","text":"This was about 17 years ago, I was working for a major computer manufacturer in support. I had been recently promoted to Coach, meaning I helped other agents that were new or having problems. The manager for the coaching department had told us that we all had to take calls for a few hours a week, so we would have an idea what was going on, and we could keep our hand in.\n\nAs it is coming up on Christmas, I didn't really have anything to do. My parents were in Australia with my brother, my ex and son were visiting her parents, and my girlfriend was visiting her parents with her two kids, leaving me on my own. Okay, I can deal with that.\n\nAs Xmas approches, I decide I am going to take some calls that day. Maybe someone who wants to be home with their family, or just needs some time off can take it. No problem.\n\nFirst call I get is from a woman that is clearly distressed, and she was frankly surprised that anyone answered the phones, but we were staffed that day. I mean people get computers as Xmas presents all the time, and some of those are going to have problems, right?\n\nSo I take the call as frontline. She says that her brand new computer won't turn on at all. It's a brand new desktop (not saying exactly what as that would make it obvious where I worked) that she bought for her son, aged I think 10 or 11. He was so excited when he opened it up he immediately wanted to turn it on and play with it. Nope, rules in that house are that everyone has to open all their presents before they got to play with any of them.\n\nThey got all their gifts open and the boy plugged in the new computer, got it all set up with keyboard and mouse, power cord, etc, and pushed the power button. Nothing. No startup chime or any lights, no reaction at all.\n\nThe checked that the cord was connected correctly, made sure the socket was working - all the preliminary stuff I would have had them do if they hadn't.

I'd like you to get a towel or soft cloth and put it in front of the computer, and I want you to disconnect all the cords, especially the power cord from it. Can you do that?\"\n\nMom: \"Yes. Okay it's done.\"\n\nMe: \"Great. Now I'd like you to lay the computer down on its display so that the stand comes out of the back going up.\"\n\nMom: \"Done.\"\n\nMe: \"Now, just behind that stand you'll see a little plastic rectangular door with a tab at the bottom. Use the tab to open the door, please.\"\n\nMom: \"Okay it's open.\"\n\nMe: \"Looking inside you'll see the computer's logic board. Right in the middle of that rectangle on the logic board do you see a metal square with a round black button in the middle?\"\n\nMom: \"Yes.\"\n\nMe: \"Good. Now I would like you to push and hold that button for 5 seconds. If you tell me when you start, I'll time it for you.\"\n\nShe pushes the button and I time her and have her release it.\n\nMe: \"Great. Now I'd like you to close the door and then put the computer back in its normal work position.

No lines on the screen, maybe it was a little dim but the adjustments might help. Indeed they did, it looked a bit better. \n\nThere were quite a few games on this machine. I started one of it's generic asteroid shooting games and, after poking around for a few seconds to make sure the touchscreen responded well enough, let the game end. It didn't freeze up. \n\nI wasn't sure of the other games, but within the bowels of the \"operator menus\" (the ones opened by either a keyswitch or a button behind a locked coin door) I found an option that said \"hard drive test\". This sounded like a good idea, certainly when the alternative was play-testing every game on the machine one by one (which I didn't think the boss would approve of, for reasons that should be obvious :) ) or putting it back out in the field without being sure that it would keep running for long enough. \n\nI tapped the \"start hard drive test\" button and confirmed the confirmation dialog box that popped up, and a progress bar appeared. I went on to check, clean and fix other machines in the warehouse while this was going on.\n\nLater on, I glanced over at the touchscreen machine and noticed it had gone blank. Upon closer inspection, the screen was still on: I could still see the raster\/light that most screens have when they're turned on, even when they're showing black. I tried the internal menu button (or was it a key switch?) and tried tapping on the screen, but it looked like no one was home. Weird. Well, not knowing what the machine was supposed to do at the end of the hard drive test, I'm not sure if it was supposed to shut down when it was done. This would be odd, though, as it lacked a \"software power button\" that modern computers have. So, I unplugged the machine, waited for 10 seconds and plugged it back in.\n\nI got the ominous \"Disk error: Press any key to restart\" text on a black background. Obviously, pressing a key is quite impossible on a touchscreen machine that lacks any physical buttons! Tapping the screen did nothing. Coin return button? Nope. Menu switch? Well, it went blank for a few seconds, apparently trying again, but the same error showed back up.\n\nWell, that can't be good. I unplugged it and waited 30 seconds this time. I plugged it back in, and sure enough, it still said \"Disk error: Press any key to restart\"\n\nYep, the built-in test somehow bricked the hard drive. It didn't overheat or anything: the fan was definitely working when I started the machine up. I had learned to always check that any cooling fans were working before allowing a machine to stay on. I'm not really sure how one would even get another copy of the machine's software in a case like this. Hopefully the manufacturer of the machine would sell you a pre-imaged hard drive as a repair part (even if it were marked up 10 ways to Sunday) \n\nI just marked it as having a \"corrupted or bad HD\" but I didn't detail how it got to that point, for fear of being somehow blamed for using the built-in test. Thankfully, that didn't happen. Unfortunately, they needed people who were also really good at moving arcade\/vending machines around for events, and I didn't make the cut on that front, so I was let go from the company after a relatively short stint there. However, I saw the inside of many more arcade machines than I ever realistically would have otherwise.\n\nTL;DR: Thank you for pressing the self destruct button. This machine will self destruct in exactly 20 minutes.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1669172466.0},{"title":"Snakes in my PSU - a real life urban legend!","author":"Dixielandblues","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/z1sfli\/snakes_in_my_psu_a_real_life_urban_legend\/","text":"I've heard variations of this bandied around and usually dismissed as an urban legend, so I thought I would share my own experience. First, a little background - I hail from Africa. A sub-saharan region, to be more specific - beautiful, hot, dry and dusty, and with interesting wildlife (you never forget your first hippo wandering down the main street in a busy city).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was working as the combined warranty\/1st\/2nd engineer for a good-size IT wholesaler, so as you can imagine my days were busy. One of the common things was people complaining their computers were running slow and shutting down at random, if they even powered up (sparks & smoke were not unheard of as PSUs clogged up). This was genrally due to being big beige Pentium 60 boxes with dinky  coolers, sitting for months under desks and sucking in all the dirt, fluff and crud that blew in on the breeze - windows and doors being permanently open to cool things down in the building. I'd unplug the offending box, park it by the back door & point my heavy duty blower at it - this usually blew out enough dirt that the thing looked like it was undergoing a test launch for NASA, but after 10-20 seconds it would be shiny and fresh and run like a dream.\n\nSo when I got the call on a morning, I thought nothing of it and went off to do the usual. The first thing I noticed as I approached the desk was a rather tasty cooking smell. Early for a braai, thought I, but on the other hand you can't beat some fresh fire-grilled delights for a good start to the day, so more power to them. Except - the smell got stronger as I got to the desk and away from the windows.\n\nHmm...\n\nStill, the PC was showing all the classic signs of a fluff-heating victim - powered off instantly, sparked a little, hot to the touch, so I unplugged it and trundled off to my well-hidden lair. Well-hidden due to the management having a  strong desire to keep their resident technological troglodyte out of the customer's eye & their own peaceful domains, if at all possible, but that is a different tale.\n\nPulled the case off the thing and wow did that fresh-grilled meat aroma fill the room. Smelled like chicken, but anyways. That was the first thing I noticed, as I wrangled the heavy steel case with it's dozen screws and manufacturer's clips that were the bastard offspring of duct tape, superglue and a crocodile off the frame.\n\nThe *second* thing was the snake head facing me, jaws open, teeth glinting and quite unexpected. After a (perfectly manly) yelp and an impressive rearward leap out the door (opening of which was acheived on the fly, as it were) I begin to notice some fine details - to whit, it appeared quite dead judging by the loose tounge and the fact it was smoking gently, and only about an inch of the body behind the head was visible, with the rest somewhere in the PSU. The poor thing was only a young brown house snake - quite harmless, and quite friendly. A lot of houses actually tried to persuade them to move in as they did wonders for rodent problems.\n\nYou see, what happens is that snakes, being cold blooded, like somewhere warm of a night to nap. A toasty hot computer plinking as it cools down in an empty office of an evening is evidently something that will fit the bill, and the only entry route they can fit through, if they can at all, is the fan\/s on the PSU. In later times I found a few more that were quite unharmed, if a little annoyed - snake scales apparently being something of a good improptu insulator, and the fans not being strong enough to do more than bonk them on the nose and irritate it - but on occasion they would touch the wrong components as they curled up for a nap. Come the morning, well, zap goes the snake and ring goes the techie's phone.\n\nSo while I cannot lay claim to the veracity of every iteration of this old tale, I can confirm for all and sundry that I have seen with my own eyes snakes in the box, just waiting for an unwary techie to drop by and say hello.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1669120359.0},{"title":"Older people and technology","author":"GoofyGoffer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/z1j6px\/older_people_and_technology\/","text":"Similar to my last story [found here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/yg4rs2\/helping_an_older_family_friend\/) about helping an older family friend I had an older guy at my church approach me about fixing his issues.

I\u2019ll get a new one ordered up.\u201d\n\nDespite the regular maintenance performed by the shop annually, owning this plane was turning out to be more work for me than I expected.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAfter getting my pilot\u2019s license in 2020, I\u2019d been dreaming of my own airplane.  I\u2019d scan ads and postings all the time, looking for a good deal that would work for me, but I wasn\u2019t having any luck.  Then one day in the spring of 2021, a post appeared on everyone\u2019s favorite \u201cIs this real, or is it a scam and I\u2019m going to get murdered in an alleyway somewhere\u201d classified board of the interwebsnets.  \r\n\r\nFor sale, a 1\/6th share of a 1973 Cessna 177RG Cardinal.  Go look it up, it\u2019s a beautiful plane.  Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll wait.  It\u2019s the best looking high-wing you\u2019re going to find and was only a \u2018failure\u2019 in replacing the 172 because Cessna\u2019s leadership made a series of stupid decisions that led to the first year\u2019s production run being underpowered and a minor engineering issue with a tendency to have the tail stall and the nose suddenly plunging to the runway at the typical speeds of the landing flare. \r\n\r\nThe RG, however, fixed all of that. Special slots had been added to the design of the stabilator (the horizontal surface at the tail) to prevent the stall, a constant-speed propeller and a 200 horsepower engine replaced the anemic fixed-pitch 150 HP engine, and by the time of the production of this particular model of the 177RG, they were given 60 gallon extended range tanks.  The RG means retractable gear, which means this strutless plane has the clean profile to accompany the power and range of the changes and has become a beloved niche airplane.\r\n\r\nSomehow, I got my wife to go see it, and then after flying in it, managed to convince her that we should buy into it.  Fifteen large simoleans later, I had a signed contract as a new member of the ownership LLC and a mandate from the group\u2019s insurance company to get 30 hours of dual time with an *approved* instructor before I\u2019m allowed to fly this plane on my own, since I had no complex rating or experience at the time.  No big deal, should only take a couple months at most.\r\n\r\nAs of today, I\u2019m still needing 3.7 hours.  Not as easy as I had expected.  \r\n\r\nBeing an A&P, I was thrilled to begin to take on some of the maintenance tasks, if needed. Unfortunately, the plane would need what is called an \u201cAnnual Inspection\u201d every year (funny how that\u2019s named) to ensure it is airworthy and doesn\u2019t need any additional maintenance.  This inspection has to be conducted by an A&P with an Inspection Authorization, something I don\u2019t have, nor do I have the time for.  Essentially, an IA is a mechanic who has a library of knowledge of the aircraft they are working on, has taken a written and oral examination, and attends a certain number of hours of continuing education events and trainings every year to maintain currency.  \r\n\r\nAn Annual Inspection, performed by the IA, is a deep dive into the conditions of the aircraft and is a perfect opportunity to find all sorts of things wrong with a plane, much like the letter checks we use at the airlines for the big birds.  It is easily one of the more expensive recurring expenses to owning a plane, so long as you don\u2019t ever think about the engine.  This year, for example, our (very old) exhaust system was falling apart and needed replacement.  It wasn\u2019t cheap, though split six ways it was much more bearable than if it had been out of my pocket alone.  Of course, the other problem with an annual is scheduling\u2014you need to get on the shop\u2019s schedule early, or else you\u2019re going to have a hard time getting in.  \r\n\r\nThanks to Covid, the gift that just keeps on giving in all sorts of new and horrible ways, $Airline has been poaching every single mechanic that had a pulse and wasn\u2019t on the Naughty List already, which means that the local General Aviation shops have been getting emptied of talent.  This has meant I\u2019ve been digging more into the incidental maintenance, thus the call from our newest owner in the group about two weeks ago. \r\n\r\nWe knew the battery was dying, but it had limped along so far, and had to have passed the load tests (it didn\u2019t) that were supposed to have been performed every year (they weren\u2019t).  I also figured it was getting it\u2019s fluids topped off every year as well.  (It wasn\u2019t.)  We let it continue doing its thing, but now we had no choice.   It was time.\r\n\r\nFirst thing I do, of course, is look in the parts manual for what part number battery it requires.  A bit of digging, and I find I can get a good old reliable Flooded Cell Battery from Textron, the company which owns Cessna, for a mere 300 bucks.  Another search of AirplaneFir, an aviation supply website, showed it for a noticeable chunk more.  On the other hand, I saw for a bit more than that we could upgrade to the fancy Sealed Lead Acid Battery (SLAB), which would remove the need for venting and other maintenance, and likely get something that\u2019ll last another five years.  Unfortunately, while the standard 177 A & B models could just accept a new SLAB without any fancy paperwork, the *177RG* required a Supplemental Type Certificate, that is, a license with conversion instructions (to really, really simplify it), to install and *different model and part number battery.*  I knew we didn\u2019t have the STC on the plane, so I presented that as part of the costs to the guys for replacement.  I would also need to enlist the help of an IA I knew to submit the FAA Form 337, as this would be a Major Alteration (because of the STC) and only an IA can submit that.\r\n\r\nAfter a week of waiting to hear back from everyone, I went and ordered up the new SLAB at the advice of my IA associate and called up the owner of the STC to register and purchase, verified that we didn\u2019t already own a license to it, and then emailed everyone to let them know I went with the SLAB.  One of the guys responded almost immediately, irate about not having a vote on the change and asking if I\u2019d actually gone and *looked* at the battery.\r\n\r\nI hadn\u2019t and immediately made the 30 minute drive to the hangar to check it out.  Naturally I didn\u2019t reply to his email right away while I went to perform the inspection I *should* have performed that first day.  And when I got to the airport, removed the aft wall off the cargo area and pulled the cover off the battery box, I started swearing.\r\n\r\nInstead of being greeted by a half dozen cell caps and a vent tube, instead I saw a pink battery with no caps at all.  Specifically, a Sealed Lead Acid Battery of the part number used only by the 177 A & B and not at all effective to the 177RG.  They\u2019d even gone so far as to remove the vent tube as required by the STC conversion, but beyond that, no paperwork had been done.  \r\n\r\nWhen I\u2019d explained exactly what I found to my fellow owners, there was no issue at all to my changing over to the SLAB and buying the STC.\r\n\r\nAbout a week later, the battery and paperwork arrived and I went over to the airport and performed the change.  And that, my dear friends, is where I stepped in it.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing about batteries is that there\u2019s a particular order to how you remove and install the cables and terminals.  You always remove the negative first and then the positive when removing the battery, then install the positive followed by the negative last when installing.  There\u2019s a warning in the manual, it\u2019s how you do things in cars, it is *standard practice.*  Only an absolute muppet could mess that up.\r\n\r\nAnd so naturally as I install the battery I suddenly lose control of my faculties and proceed to hook up the *negative* terminal first, followed by the positive.  And as my socket is tightening that last contact, my wrench slips and \r\n\r\n###KRAKOWW!!\r\n\r\nThankfully I\u2019d at least taken the precaution of wearing gloves and didn\u2019t feel the juice myself.  But the poor aluminum skin of the airplane did.  And boy, did it feel it.  The back of my socket wrench was singed, but the skin of the plane was now sporting a ragged 1\/8\u201d hole where I\u2019d contacted.  I checked to make sure there was no other damage, made sure the battery wasn\u2019t ruined now, and verified all the instruments in the plane still worked.  Amazingly, I hadn\u2019t fried anything.  \r\n\r\nI called up a friend with a hangar across the airfield and asked if I could borrow his sheetmetal tools and he gave me his door code.  It took about five trips to get everything I needed (I gathered everything right away, but kept forgetting things in the other hangar), just as any home project requires multiple trips to the hardware store and eventually managed to drill out the hole and install a 3\/16\u201d rivet in a standard repair.\r\n\r\nWhat had been a ten minute job had turned into almost two hours of driving between hangars.  You\u2019d think I\u2019d be smarter than that.\r\n\r\nBut hey, the plane flies now, so I can\u2019t complain too much, right?\n\n\nEdit: because there's been a stink raised in the comments about me being \"unlicensed\" and \"inexperienced\", let me assure you that I am actually licensed, and experience doesn't stop stupid from happening.  \n\nAs far as the accusation of an illegal repair, at that point you can talk to my lawyer and IAs.\n\n\n*Enjoy what you've read?

I had such an encounter a few months ago.\n\nOne of our departments had a new joiner and they needed a piece of software installed on the joiner's computer.  We looked through our software catalogue, but couldn't find it.  But, when we checked our inventory tool, we found that everyone in their department had it installed.  I put it down to poor documentation, downloaded an installer, installed the program, confirmed it ran, and left it at that.\n\nA few days later, I'm asked what the license key is.  Bugger.  I look through our shared mailbox and cannot find any references to this product or vendor.  I check our licenses folder and turn up nothing.  I check with the team making the request to find out when previous licenses were purchased, check it against the department's budget for the periods when the licenses had been bought in the past, and discover we never purchased the licenses.\n\nAfter some more digging, I find out that the license cost is CHF 125 per user, they've been purchased on the old manager's company credit card, the new manager does not have a company credit card, the current licenses they have are for an older version of the application, they previously licensed a user that no longer works for the company, their old license cannot be transferred to the current version, and we cannot find an installer for the version they currently have.  I reach out to the vendor's support for an old installer and, as expected, they told us to upgrade.\n\nSome arguments ensue as to who should be responsible for buying the new license.  I say it shouldn't be us, my manager concurs, their manager doens't want the cost on their cost centre, and this new joiner is sat there twiddling their thumbs one day a week because they need this software to complete their tasks.\n\nSo I take a step back and figure out what this program acutally does and what it is used for.\n\nIt actually seems like a pretty cool application.  You enter a path, enter some keywords or serach terms, apply some filters (create date, last modified, file type, etc.), and it will return all files that staisfy those terms, identifying duplicates, highlighting the similarities or differences between files, etc.  I ran it on our department's contracts folder and was able to find the invoice for a storage array we had purchased seven years prior, but hadn't been able to find the invoice for, which was preventing us from selling it to a reseller.\n\nBut why did they need the program?\n\nEvery day, a series of reports come in from various locations.  These reports are dumped into a single folder.  The file names are randomly generated.  Sometimes, 2 or 3 reports can come in between them checking the folder, but they only need the latest report.  Sometimes reports are accidentally sent with no data in them, so these need to be discarded.  They periodically need to find the latest report for a specific location and then email it to another team in another country.  Different people on the team are responsible for different locations, hence why all the team need this program.\n\nSo the team will open the program, enter the path of the folder containing all the reports, search for the location code, and then click 'go'.  They then drag the latest report into the folder for that location and send an email to the team based in another country.\n\nIt took about 5 minutes to understand the above process.\n\nI took a look into the contents of the report and saw that it's basically a CSV with a strange file extension.  The first row is a header, containing the names for each column.  The third column is the location code, which always follows one of the same formats:\n\n    [number][letter][number][number]\n    [number][letter][letter][number]\n    [number][letter][letter][letter]\n    [number][letter][number][letter]\n\nWithin 15 minutes, I've written and tested a PowerShell script that will scan through all the files in the folder, use regex on the second line to extract the location code, copy the file to a new folder renaming it to the location code and the date the report was generated (plus an auto-incrementing number on the end if there are more than one from the same day), and then adding the original file name to a text file to prevent the script from checking the same file twice.\n\nThe script was placed on a task server and scheduled to run every 15 minutes.\n\nThis meant the team could now go into this new folder, use Windows Search to find the location code, and then read the date in the file name to identify the latest report.  It took about 5 minutes to train the team on the new process.  And then, upon realising that the team they forward these reports to could perform the task just as easily, it took another 5 minutes to change the path the renamed reports are saved to, and train the second team on their new process.\n\nThey'd been using this process for around five years.  It took them around 3 hours a week to complete.  They'd purchased four licenses for the tool so far at around CHF 125 per license.  Estimating their hourly rate at CHF 30, their cost to date for completing this task would have been:\n\n    30 x 3 x 52 x 5 = 23,400\n            125 x 4 =    500\n                      ------\n                      23,900 CHF\n                     ~24,200 EUR\n                     ~25,040 USD\n\nObviously, inflation, exchange rates, discount rate, etc. would alter this figure.  But my hourly rate is around CHF 41 an hour.  I spent probably an hour trying to implement their solution, 5 minutes understanding their problem, and 25 minutes implementing and training them on my solution, a solution that eliminated one team's need to do any work at all on this particular task.  That's 90 minutes, costing CHF 61.50.\n\nCHF 23,900.  CHF 61.50.  Do the maths.\n\nIn short, when you have a problem, come to IT, don't try to figure it out yourself.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1668938600.0},{"title":"But what if no one answers part deux","author":"iguru42","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/yyt0bi\/but_what_if_no_one_answers_part_deux\/","text":"Previous tale:  https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/tqycms\/but_what_if_no_one_answers\/\n\nSO!

We were looking to move to VOIP from an OLD and i mean old PBX system. I had some VOIP experience so guess who they asked from IT to get this started. Easy guess , me.\n\n  \nWe went through a few vendors and a few demos and after a couple of months and a little coaxing we went with the Cisco solution. Fast forward we implement the solution and after a few late nights and long days all is well. I maintain the system on the network side and since i have previous experience with VOIP i learn as much as i can when comes to CUCM and UCCX (Keep UCCX in mind). Over years i take various training classes and overall be become pretty proficient in all things CUCM and UCCX. I also develop some pretty good contacts that i can lean on within Cisco for help with anything i may need some some assistance on. Keep in mind these contacts are outside of Cisco TAC.\n\n  \nFast forward a few years and a new VP of the Dept the Contact Center is in is assigned to head up the dept. He goes over some of the reporting and does not like the numbers. I just heard this via hearsay. My thinking is \"I guess some changes may need to be made personell wise to achieve the numbers you want\". Mind you i just said this in my head, i never expressed this to anyone. It was just a thought. A couple of weeks go by and i get a call asking to attend a meeting later that day. No big deal i get to the conference room and its the VP of the Contact Center, and the Contact Center supervisors. We all exchange pleasantries and they get to meat of why they asked me here.\n\n  \nVP - \"We been looking at these reporting numbers and we don't think that they are right\"  \n\n\nMe - \" What do you think is off with the numbers\"  \n\n\nVP - \"Call Center Supervisor #1, can you explain further?\"  \n\n\nCall Center Supervisor #1 - \"These numbers are all off. We think some of these people had to be taking more calls than this. Something must be wrong with the system  \n\n\nMe - \"Let me know exactly what report you are running and i'll look into it.\"  \n\n\nThey send me the name of the report and off i go into report land. The land of pulling numbers from a database and checking on its accuracy. After a couple of days of trouble shooting i'm really not seeing anything wrong. I note my findings via email and don't hear anything back. I'm thinking the matter is closed but little do i know in an exective meeting its being told that the numbers are \"way off\" and LongIsland is wrong and does not have a clue. The system is wrong.\"  \n\n\nNow i have no problem being wrong but in this case the data is the data. Just because you don't like whats in the report doesn't mean I or the report is wrong. Time to step this up a notch. I decided to get on the phone with a few of my contacts at Cisco. I sent them over the reports and we performed a quick webex and determined the reports were indeed legit and made sure i had their verification in Email. I scheduled a meeting with the Cisco Contacts, Contact Center VP, Supervisors and my VP to go over the findings and the meeting sort of went like this.  \nAfter exchanging introductions.  \n\n\nCisco Contact - \"So heard you are having some issues with numbers generated on this particular report.\"  \n\n\nContact Center VP - \"Yeah these number are way off, they cannot be right. We think there is issue with the system.\"  \n\n\nCisco Contact - LongIsland and i went over the system and the numbers thoroughly and i really dont see any issues. Usually in cases like this the customer wants the numbers to reflect what they feel they should reflect. The numbers pulled from the database are just that. They cannot be manipulated in any way. Usually when they don't produce the results you want that is a personell issue not a data issue. We do have a few consultants that can help you acheive the numbers you are trying to attain. if you like i can reach out to them on your behalf.\"  \n\n\nSilence  \n\n\nMe - I guess we will have to take this offline. Thanks for your help Cisco Contact.  \n\n\nAnd that was that. It was hard to keep that shit eating grin off my face and my VP knew it. I never heard about any issues with UCCX reports again.

They also glued a washer over the broken end of the pulley. The string couldn't slip off anymore, but may still catch on the remaining broken part from time to time. I suppose that will have to do until a replacement part was obtained. The boss knew what it needed so if he wanted me to order it myself, I figured he would say so.\n\nYou may remember that I mentioned a missing ground prong on the plug. I included that in the email to my boss about the claw machine. We didn't originally get the machine like that, it broke off in an outlet while it was at our store. We didn't have any replacement plugs OR cords that I knew of, but in this disorganized mess of a store, who could say? \n\nA couple weeks later, on a day where the boss wasn't there, a customer complained that the claw machine shocked him. I described what an electric shock from AC felt like and asked if it felt like that, or more like a static shock. He said it felt like AC was present. So I asked him to, without touching the machine, point to what shocked him. He pointed to the metal box where the joystick and coin slots were. I told him, thanks. He left the store without another word. \n\nI grabbed my little voltage detector pen, and turned it on, testing it on a known-live outlet before I \"trusted\" it. I poked the metal box with it. The pen lit up and beeped. Ruh roh. I then poked the metal decorative trim that ran up the corners\/edges, which surrounded the decorative \"rope lights\" or \"strip lights\". This too was live. Yikes! Even the metal frame of the front door was live, with 110 VAC.\n\nThis needed to be unplugged, IMMEDIATELY, and not hooked back up until it was repaired. The trouble was moving the machine back so I could remove the plug without touching either 1: The metal trim up the corners, 2: the coin\/controller box, or 3: The metal frame of the front door. I didn't have any insulated gloves, and even if I did, I was wearing a short sleeved shirt and didn't have a coat to cover my arms, due to the weather that day. I asked my coworker if he knew which breaker controlled that set of outlets where the claw machine was. He said he didn't know. I told him that he should shut down the computer, because it might lose power. He asked why, and I explained the claw machine was shocking people, and I couldn't reach the plug without touching the machine, so I needed to find the breaker, and that might mean the computer would lose power. He said he needed the computer to stay on. I literally facepalmed right in front of him, and said \"I don't think you understand, there is high voltage on the outside of the machine. The outside that people can touch. That means someone could get electrocuted, and we would get sued. That could put us out of business, which means we would all lose our jobs. No one's lives are depending on that computer right now, nor is our business.\"\n\nWith that, I went to the breaker room and took a few guesses. I went back out to the floor, and I had indeed shut off the outlet cluster that fed the claw machine. I pulled the machine away from the wall and unplugged it. I opened up the back cover and removed the fuse, putting a big DANGER note covering the fuse slot. This was inside the machine. Since the machine was on wheels, I went ahead and wheeled it to the back room, and then I turned the breakers back on. \n\nI called the boss and left a message explaining why the claw machine had been moved to the back room. \n\nI took the cord and tried using a continuity checker to zero in on the source of the problem. I measured between the hot prong and the metal parts on the outside, but the checker didn't beep or light up. I figured if it did, I could disconnect parts of the machine one by one until I found where the short was. Unfortunately, the continuity checker isn't seeing it, so it's probably a case of slight leakage from something rather than a dead short. So I armed myself with the multimeter and voltage detector pen from before. \n\nI went through a similar process that I'd originally planned, but with the ohms setting on my meter. I measure between the hot prong and the metal trim on the machine. It should either be open or at least in the mega-ohms, but it's lower resistance than that. Not a dead short, though, so it probably isn't an actual frayed wire touching the inside of one of the metal parts. So I disconnected one light fixture inside the machine, but the leakage was still there. I disconnected another light fixture, the leakage was still there. I disconnected the power supply... bingo! There was leakage between Hot and Ground on the power supply. \n\nThe ground strap is supposed to be connected to the inside of all user-accessible metal trim, so that if a hot wire touches it from inside, it shorts out and blows a fuse\/breaker. However, with the third prong missing on the plug, the ground strap instead carried the fault current from the power supply to all the outside metal parts of the machine. I reconnected the lights, but left the power supply box disconnected. The power supply was 24V for the motors and 5V for the control board. Great, that shouldn't be hard to find. I labeled the wires for the power supply outputs so we'd know where the wires were supposed to go on the new power supply when we got one. \n\nWe lacked any ticketing or record keeping system for repairs of machines that belonged to us, so I just wrote on a blank piece of paper that the machine needed a new 24V\/5V power supply, and a new cord or plug (The missing ground prong was the reason the machine became live on the outside. With a ground prong, the fuse would have simply blown instead, or lower current leakage would just harmlessly go to ground) \n\nI worked on some other machines, did some cleaning and busy work until closing time and went home for the day. \n\nThe next day, I see the claw machine back out on the floor already. Given that both of my coworkers had a track record of disregard for electrical safety, I had little doubt it was still a shock risk. Indeed, I grabbed my voltage detector pen, poked the metal coin door with it, and found that it was live, again! They had hooked the same power supply back up again, and didn't replace the plug! If they had done *either* the machine wouldn't be live! But where did they get another fuse? I pulled out the original, and we didn't have any in stock as far as I knew. Unless.... You guessed it, they bypassed the fuse to get the machine running again, effectively going for double Jeopardy: Now you can get shocked AND burn the store down! Of course, what else are claw machines for?\n\nI called my boss and, since he of course didn't pick up, I basically left a message saying that someone else had undone all my safety measures and put the machine back out on the floor, still unrepaired, still a shock hazard to customers who simply wanted to play the machine. This time, the machine was in a different position and I was able to safely reach the plug without pulling the breaker first. \n\nI honestly can't imagine how the idiot managed to plug it in without touching the metal parts, which would have immediately clued him in that neither I nor the customer were joking when we said it was shocking people. \n\nNow you're all saying \"cut the plug off\" and yes, in hindsight I probably could have done that. However, I figured the boss might consider that destruction of the store's property (even though that would be the first step to putting a new plug on the end of the cord) which is why I didn't do that. That said, I had pretty much run out of any other options that didn't involve physical violence. \n\nAfter unplugging the machine, I disconnected the power supply from the inside, then plugged it back in so the lights would be on, therefore my idiot coworkers would be none the wiser until\/unless they actually tried to play it, or looked at the little LED screen that was supposed to show the credits and time. \n\nTo be clear, the machine was now technically safe to touch for people. It just wouldn't work with the power supply disconnected, but it wouldn't shock people either.\n\nWhoever pulled it back out was clearly fixated on having a claw machine out on the floor. Therefore, I decided to look and see if we had a power cord and power supply from another machine so we could have the claw machine working again. \n\nI asked my coworkers if they knew of any machines that we could use for parts. They both said no. I asked if they knew of anything else that used a 24V supply. They had no idea. Well, thanks for nothing, I guess.\n\nThis was the only claw machine we had in the store, so using another one for parts (or using this one for parts to fix that one) wasn't an option. I went to the back room and checked if we had any power supplies. Finding anything back there was always a chore due to the lack of organization. I found that most of them were 12 V power supplies. I didn't think wiring them in series for 24V would actually work due to the capacitors in the power supply, and I'd hate to ruin a good power supply trying it. \n\nWell, I decided to take a closer look at some other machines to see if their power supplies will work. Nah, most of them are 12 volts. But, a long-deceased driving game (the motherboard quit) with a force feedback motor on the steering wheel had a 24V power supply that still worked! I put a note on the machine \"Power supply removed for claw machine up front, PS make \/ model was x\/y, specs were z\" so if anyone objected, they could revert it to it's original state, and if they found a replacement motherboard, they'd know what power supply to get. Now for the cord.\n\nEvery machine I could find back there had the ground prong missing. What the heck is it with the lack of ground prongs? Pretty much everything in the back either belonged to a customer, or appeared to be a \"scrap\" machine. But there was nothing I could \"steal\" an intact cord from, all the good ones had long since been taken to fix other machines, and none of them had been replaced. At this point I had already mentioned to the boss that we needed more cords or plugs, so I decided to not pester him about it.\n\nWell, I could at least half-fix the machine. With the wires already labeled, I unplugged the machine, removed the old power supply and connected the wires to the new one. I put the fuse back in, but did not connect the \"hot\" wire from the cord back to the new PSU, since we still needed to fix the missing ground issue. I figured if they saw the machine was \"working\" again, they wouldn't see the need to fix the ground issue. \n\nA few days later, I noticed someone playing the machine. At least they weren't getting shocked, but out of curiosity, I looked at the cord when they were done playing. What do you know, a new plug was put on. It was even done properly, what more do you want? Other than a new pulley, where the original still had a washer glued on it. \n\nA few more days later, the inevitable happened and the washer came unglued, allowing the string to tangle up again. I asked around about what kind of glue was used, so that I could try a different kind of glue, but no one knows what was originally used. I wasn't sure anything would work that well between metal and plastic. With the string tangled up, I was worried that if someone tried to play the machine, the up\/down motor might burn out or the gears could strip. Therefore, I disconnected the power supply inside the machine once again.\n\nI had figured that sometime the next day, I could try super glueing the washer back on. The beginning of that day, I turned the machines on like always. I was the only one who turned them off after closing, my coworkers left them on. A few minutes later, I hear the dreaded sound of \"capacitor popcorn\" coming from the general direction of the claw machine. \n\nSure enough, the claw machine was quickly filling with smoke. I unplugged it quickly and grabbed the fire extinguisher and flung the door open. There were no actual flames, so rather than actually spray, I waited to see if the smoke died down on it's own. Thankfully, it did. It was coming from the motherboard and the power supply. Oh fsck.\n\nI took a closer look and found that one of the connectors had been pulled out, but then put back in backwards. To be fair, they weren't keyed which meant this was possible without the use of a hammer. However, the connectors didn't need to be unplugged to begin with. I unscrewed the board and approached my coworker.\n\nMe: \"Were you messing with the claw machine, by any chance?\" \nIdiot: \"Yeah, the machine wasn't working again so I figured I could pull the connectors out and put them back in again and it would work\"\nMe: \"Well you put it in backwards\"\nIdiot: \"So? Just put it back the right way\"\nMe: (Screaming internally, I put the board where it's plainly visible to him, with all the burned traces, popped capacitors and chips with craters in them, all visible) \"It's destroyed. You reverse a connector or put it in the wrong hole, this is what happens. Did you not see all that smoke or hear those popping noises? If I hadn't been there, it might have caused a fire.\"\n\nRemember how there was no information about this machine available anywhere? Even with the manufacturer's name in hand, I couldn't even find a picture of it, let alone a manual. This meant that finding an entire circuit board, or even just a programmed microcontroller, would have been darn near impossible. Okay, I suppose it would be technically possible, but only to the extent that winning the lottery would also be \"technically possible\". In other words, realistically, we were never going to find another motherboard for this machine. It's fate was sealed.\n\nTL;DR: Claw machine gets a band-aid fix for the broken pulley. Later on, a deadly electrical short occurs and both my coworkers insist that it remain plugged in despite it being a death trap. I fixed the short by replacing the power supply. Someone replaced the plug, properly. But then, one of the idiots tried \"fixing\" the machine by reseating the connectors, but accidentally reversed it and burned out the motherboard.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1668645356.0},{"title":"During a shift change","author":"theoboley","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/ywucdg\/during_a_shift_change\/","text":"I'm just getting settled in for my day and my first tech support call of the day comes in.\n\nMe: \"Help Desk, this is (me)\"\n\nUser: \"Hi...I locked my keys in my car\"\n\n*Silence for about 10 seconds*\nU: \"hello?\"\n\nM: \"Yes, I'm still here, is there an issue with a computer you're having?\"\n\nU: \"no...

Ever since I had started there, the claw had been stuck: it would move forward, backward, left and right, but not up and down.\n\nI took it upon myself to try and figure out the problem. First, I opened it up and unscrewed the cover over the \"box\" that held the mechanism that moved the claw up and down. One of the plastic pulleys was broken in such a way that the little string could slip off and get stuck. Indeed, the string was already tangled up every which way. Now, I hadn't dealt with a claw machine before, so some kind of manual would help if I could find one. I'll also need to figure out who built the thing to be able to order a part for it. \n\nNow, the claw machine had a name on the \"marquee\" but it did not show a manufacturer's name. I opened up the machine and look for any evidence of who made the thing. There is none: the machine is literally built with no-name parts. The motors, the board, the power supply, all lack any manufacturer's name on them. On an unrelated note, I found a manual for a completely different machine, stuffed inside this claw machine.\n\nWell, the machine itself obviously wasn't the best place to find the manufacturer's info in this case. So I punted and just Googled (name of machine) claw machine. \n\nWell, disappointingly, after going through page after page (while doing other things around the store in between) I found practically nothing pointing me in the direction of who made this thing, or even, for that matter, if the company still exists.\n\nLater, someone found an old brochure online from a well-known arcade game manufacturer, advertising the machine. A company that was still in business! Great! So I called them up. \n\nOops, premature celebration. It turns out that company also used to *sell* other machines that they themselves did not make, and this was one of them. The company that actually made the machine itself had long since gone bankrupt. The support rep also didn't know of any machines that shared any parts with this one. But on the other hand, I am now armed with the name of the original manufacturer, so I may not be able to order original parts, but I could probably find information about how this thing is supposed to work so that I can rethread the string properly.\n\nArmed with the name of the manufacturer, I turned to Google again. I Googled and Googled until my Googler was sore, and, for the lack of a phrase that rhymes, I found ZERO evidence that the manufacturer *ever* existed or what they made.\n\nI had tried (name with an A) and (other name with an O) in case I heard the guy wrong over the phone. I tried it as one word, and as two words. None of which yielded any additional results to even tell me which name was accurate.\n\nIn short, I was back to square one.\n\nThe next time I came back to this machine, I decided to try finding parts another way. I used calipers to take measurements of the pulleys that the string wrapped around, so that I could order replacements whose measurements matched. \n\nAs I looked up claw machine parts, I was rather disconcerted to find that, out of everyone that makes or sells parts for claw machines in general, *all* of them listed the specific machine(s) that the parts would fit and *none* of them listed the dimensions! So my measurements weren't worth a quarter.\n\nLater on, a light bulb came on over my head. Perhaps some industrial suppliers might sell pullies for other purposes that happen to match the size, or at least be close enough? After all, there's nothing particularly extravagent or unusual about these pullies as far as I can tell. \n\nI spent some time searching around industrial machine suppliers that took small-quantity orders. I decided to simply forward links to the product pages to my boss, so that he could research the actual suppliers and decide on which one was the best one to use. I also forwarded the measurements as well, in case he had another kind of machine with a similar enough part to fit, or for that matter, try to fabricate something. I also pointed out that the plug was missing the ground prong, so we would need to order more replacement plugs unless we had some somewhere that I didn't know about.\n\nStay tuned for the second part of the story.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1668613971.0},{"title":"\"Can you help me bypass those pesky US-sanctions?\"","author":"SonOfAQuiche","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/yw4c9j\/can_you_help_me_bypass_those_pesky_ussanctions\/","text":"So this one is fairly short, but I was absolutely in awe.\n\nI work as second line support for a big multinational.

In accordance with the rules, the names of the people and businesses involved have been changed.\n\nThis story goes back to the early 2000's.  I was working for an IT support company located in the city of New Bedford, Massachusetts.  New Bedford has a rich fishing history and was once considered to be \"the whaling capital of the world\".  In fact, the story of \"Moby Dick\" takes place in this very city.  However, at the time this story takes place, New Bedford would more accurately be described as \"the Mos Eisley of Massachusetts\" - you would never find a more wretched hive of sum and villainy.  Especially on the waterfront.\n\nThe fishing industry being the main center of commerce for New Bedford, many of our clients were in this line of business.  One client in particular, Stormy Seas Fisheries, is at the center of this story.  Stormy Seas was a good client.  They were easy to deal with, paid their bills, rarely complained, and were not too demanding.  We enjoyed supporting them.\n\nOne day I walked into the office and the owner of the IT company, his wife, and several employees, were standing around talking with concerned looks on their faces.  There was a story in one of the local newspapers which reported Stormy Seas was the victim of a literal \"hostile takeover\" where a man named James Greco literally held a gun to the owner's face and informed him he would be taking over.  We came to learn that James was a major figure of organized crime in the area.\n\nThe discussion was about what to do about the situation.  As I said, Stormy Seas was a great client and we'd hate to lose them.  After some deliberation the decision was made to keep them on and just see how it goes.  So we did, and things went along just as before.  We'd show up onsite, the same people were there, no weird vibes, no red flags, no sign of this mysterious organized crime figure.  Stormy Seas continued to pay their bills no questions asked and we happily continued supporting them.\n\nThis went along for several months, and honestly most of us had forgotten all about the whole hostile takeover bit because as I said, no weirdness came out of it.  Then one day we got a call from a woman we had never heard of but who claimed to work for Stormy Seas Fisheries and was reporting a problem with the internet connection at their house and asked if we could urgently send someone by.  We weren't really in the business of doing residential work, but since Stormy Seas was such a good client we figured we'd do them a favor and send someone.  That someone ended up being me.  Me, a young and na\u00efve 20-something with too much innocence and zeal for his own good. So I drove out to the address in a wealthy part of a neighboring town.  As I pulled up to the house I drove past a Ford Explorer SUV with dark tinted windows and bristling with antennas sitting on the side of the road near the end of the driveway.  I thought that was odd but I paid it no mind as I pulled into the driveway and arrived at what locals would have described as a \"Portuguese Palace\".  Those familiar with the area would know what I mean.  An expansive front lawn lined by a wrought iron fence, a long gravel driveway leading to an ornate concrete staircase with concrete lion gargoyles on either side, terminating at a large house with a brick and stucco finish and a gigantic wooden door.\n\nI strolled up to the door and rang the bell.  It opened, and I was suddenly faced with what could best be described as a human grizzly bear who dwarfed my wiry 5'11\" frame.  A large, imposing man who looked like he hadn't shaved or changed clothes in about a week.  Taken aback, I looked up at the man, held out my hand and sheepishly said \"Hi, I'm Dark Helmet, I'm here to fix the computer.\"\n\n\"The man smiled, gripped my hand with his giant meat paw and said \"Hey, nice to meet you!  Jimmy Greco!\"\n\nI felt my entire body tense up.  I tried to maintain my composure but I'm pretty certain my eyeballs were bulging out of my head as I remembered the newspaper story as an image of this man stalking into the office of Stormy Seas Fisheries and holding a gun to the owner's head flashed before my eyes.\n\nI think I blacked out a bit because the next memory I have is of me in the living room sitting at the computer at a desk in the corner, pecking away, while Jimmy sat on the couch to my left.  I glanced over at him and I noticed a bulge under one of his pant legs near the ankle.  An ankle bracelet, I realized.  Suddenly it all came together.  Jimmy's disheveled appearance.  The unmarked SUV watching the house.  The urgent need to repair the internet.  This man was under house arrest!  I would later learn the SUV belonged to the FBI.\n\nSo Jimmy was sitting there just jabbering my ear off with small talk.  He seemed almost giddy to have someone new to talk to.  By the way, you have to imagine his voice in the stereotypical baritone NY City gangster accent you hear in movies, because that's exactly what he sounded like.\n\n\"So anyways, what'd you say your name was again kid?\"\n\nI replied nervously, \"Dark Helmet\".\n\nJimmy leaned back and pensively said, \"Helmet\u2026 Helmet\u2026 I know a few Helmets\u2026\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah, well I know my uncle Bill is friends with Chris.\"  (Chris was another guy who worked at Stormy Seas, and my uncle was notorious for having friends in low places.)\n\nJimmy cocked his head to the side in thought as he pondered. \"Hmmm\u2026 Helmet\u2026 Billy Helmet\u2026 Hey, didn't he have a twin brother?\"\n\nNot really sure where this was going I replied, \"Yeah, Tom.  That's my dad.\" (They are identical twins.)\n\nJimmy's eyes narrowed as he leaned forward towards me, gesturing with his index finger at me as he spoke.  Sort of jabbing at the air towards me with his finger.\n\n\"Yeah, Tom Helmet!  TOM HELMET!\"  He said excitedly, his eyes gleaming.  \"You know, I was in Walpole once.  He was one of my CO's!\"\n\nWalpole was a prison.  CO stands for Corrections Officer.  Prison guard in layman's terms.  Yes, my dad worked there.\n\nI froze and just stared blankly at the screen in front of me as I felt the blood drain away from my face.  \"I'm dead.  I am never leaving this house alive.  I'm going to be killed and dismembered and buried in this man's back yard.\"  These thoughts raced through my head as I tried to judge my ability to spring from my chair and dash out the door before Jimmy had time to leap from the couch and tackle me.\n\nThen, the unexpected happened.  Jimmy relaxed and leaned back as his face brightened and he said, \"You know, he was a REALLY nice guy!\"\n\nI'm pretty sure I visibly breathed a sigh of relief and relaxed as I felt the color return to my face.  Jimmy went on and regaled me of stories of my father's kindness while he was imprisoned in Walpole.  Come to find out, my dad was the night kitchen officer.  Some inmates who had certain dietary needs or medical conditions were allowed a carton of milk in their cell after hours.  Jimmy at the time was a young 18 year old kid.  My dad took pity on him and would bring him any extra milk he had, even though Jimmy technically wasn't allowed to have it in his cell.\n\nI still had work to do and Jimmy was still talkative so the banter continued.\n\n\"So, you got any brothers or sisters?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have a younger sister.\"\n\n\"Oh, and what does she do for work?\"\n\n\"She's a massage therapist.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah?  Massage Therapy, that's nice!  You know, last year for Christmas the guys from the office got me one of those you know \"massage a month\" type deals.  Dumb \\[expletive\\] only showed up three times and stopped coming.  I oughta send someone out to bust her knee caps.  Hey, you should give me your sister's number!\"\n\n\"Yeah\u2026 uh\u2026  I'll uh\u2026 give it to Chris and he can give it to you.\"\n\n\"Thanks, kid!\"\n\nSpoiler: I didn't.\n\nThis is where our story concludes.  I have absolutely no recollection of what the actual problem was with the computer or internet connection.  I do remember texting my dad on the way down the driveway something like \"Hi dad, Jimmy Greco says hi and thanks for the milk!\" and I waved to the FBI folks as I drove past.  My license plate number and description of my vehicle is probably enshrined in an FBI file in Boston somewhere.  That was the last time we ever saw or heard from Jimmy Greco.  Shortly after these events he was tried and convicted, but he was released from prison in 2011.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1668448285.0},{"title":"In case of stupid wiring, break device","author":"dickcheney600","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/yvguwt\/in_case_of_stupid_wiring_break_device\/","text":"I worked at a company that made 110VAC and 220VAC motors, all of which had some degree of control intelligence built into them. Some of them only had a soft-start routine along with current protection (so if something stopped the motor from turning, it wouldn't burn out) but others allowed an input from an external system to control them. The soft start ability would save energy in the long run for things that had to cycle on and off a lot.\n\nThe previous owners of the building also had the need to test certain things on 220VAC as well. How did they do this? No, of course they didn't use a proper outlet into which only 220VAC plugs would fit. They wired a regular 110VAC outlet to be 220VAC instead. You can probably guess where this is going.\n\nSo as I understand it, they wanted to use the power strip as a convenient switch for their motor. The power strip they chose was also a surge protector, which by definition does something to prevent an excessive voltage from reaching devices plugged into it. There are power strips that are JUST power strips, and we had several of those, which didn't give a hoot about the input voltage. Surge protectors, on the other hand, *must* react to an overvoltage, by definition.\n\nI was working on something else when my coworker brought me the surge protector. He admitted that he hooked it up to 220 and it went \"pop\" and didn't work anymore. I set it aside, and kept at my current project until I was done with it. \n\nLater on, I had nothing better to do, so I decide to take apart the surge protector, assuming there's any way to do so non-destructively in the first place. And indeed, there was. It wasn't designed intentionally to *prevent* repairs, but it wasn't designed with repairs in mind, either. I'll leave it at that. \n\nI was looking for a fuse, but before I even found it, I saw the problem. The traces that once carried the input power were *gone* and the surface of the board itself has two big burn marks where the traces used to be. There actually *was* a thermal fuse next to the MOVs, as well as a circuit breaker which was part of the switch. Both of which did diddly squat.

We have a \"Corporate PDM\" group for our team's stuff. If any other organization at the company needs to assign a ticket to us, they just put it in the \"Corporate PDM\" group and we get notified of it. There is even a document in the ticketing system, so if you search for \"PDM\" then this document comes up and says, \"Assign to the 'Corporate PDM' group.\" We can see on a ticket if someone searched for such a ticketing system document and indicated it was the solution.\n\nOur corporation acquired another company a few years back. One thing that Old Company -- let's call them OLDco -- had in-progress was an attempt to put a PDM system in place.\n\nAt first, it sounded like our PDM group would have to provide support to the users of this other PDM system, but our management wanted it kept separate from our \"normal\" tickets. So we created a new group in the ticketing system, called \"Corporate PDM - OLDco\" to be distinctive.\n\nAfter having done that, and after the folks at that acquired company saw our PDM system, they decided to abandon their project. We never used the group, and we dropped members from it, so no one got notifications about it.\n\nOur mistake was in not requesting deletion of the \"Corporate PDM - OLDco\" group at that time.\n\nEvery so often, the ticketing system people see this unused group and decide to harvest it. They ask me, and I say to go ahead. Then they come back and say they can't, there's a ticket in it.\n\nLo and behold, they are right. Such tickets are put in by folks in IT helpdesks in other countries. We all use the same ticketing system, but apparently they hear that someone was once part of OLDco, so they look for groups with OLDco in the name to assign the ticket. It is important to understand that there are no ticketing system help documents that tell anyone to use the \"Corporate PDM - OLDco\" group. Not one. So these other helpdesk people are not following proper procedure in assigning tickets.\n\nSo, I take the tickets (which are weeks or months old at that point), reassign them to the proper group, ask the IT agent who assigned them to the wrong place why they did it, and to update whatever documentation they are using, because they shouldn't do this again.\n\nBut the next time a harvest cycle comes around, the same problem crops up with someone else who put a ticket in there. It's like playing whack-a-mole with a game that's been put in storage, but someone won't unplug it while a mole is sticking up, and they won't let the person who whacks the mole do the unplugging.\n\nIt feels like I've been doing this every quarter of the last two years. Today, I got ahold of someone who is involved in the harvest process, and he says they will expedite the harvest, hopefully it will happen tomorrow.\n\nI'm keeping my fingers crossed, but I am not holding my breath.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1668093762.0},{"title":"This one goes way past 11","author":"CroMignonMan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/yqoi8a\/this_one_goes_way_past_11\/","text":"A recent security camera post reminded me of an issue I ran into with my mother-in-law's home business security cameras a few years ago:\n\nEvery time the power went out her system would not be accessible from the network when it came back up,  you could only reach the cameras by connecting a monitor to the local device. \n\nShe would call the installer and they would come out and fix it 'under warranty'.

No phones, no computers, nothing can connect to the internet. I'm like, what the hell is going on...\n\nLast Friday we had a bunch of storms roll through and knock out power for a few minutes, on and off.

But then I plugged in a spare phone that was new in the box to test it... dead.\n\n\\**angry IT Guy noises*\\*\n\nThen today nothing would connect at all. I'm thinking \"Did the storms blow out my network switch somehow?\" Except there were three devices in the building that still had connectivity throughout all this, and they were all connected to the switch with all the other devices that were failing. And some of the devices that weren't working earlier started working for a bit, and then stopped again.\n\nNow I'm even *more* confused.\n\nThen I logged onto the one computer that could still connect, and went back to my training: I ran ipconfig.

I'm like, \"why do these two have different Default Gateways... how the hell did that happen...\"\n\nAnd then I realized what the IP address it was pointing to was:\n\nThe security camera DVR.\n\nTuesday of last week, the security camera company came in and put in a new DVR. For reasons I don't understand, even though they knew the old camera DVR was on my main network and all the cameras they were setting up were analog cameras directly connected to the DVR... they set it up as a DHCP server. So when Friday rolled around and the storms knocked out our power, everything started getting its IP addresses from the DVR instead of my network's DHCP server.\n\nWent into the DVR settings to confirm... sure enough, they had its DHCP server turned on. Turned that off, rebooted my network switches, and everything went back to normal.\n\nIt's Tuesday and I already feel like I've worked a full week.\n\nEdit: Couple points...\n\nFirst of all, the reason these aren't on a separate VLAN is they're old-school analog cameras that are wired to the DVR over coax, not IP cameras. When the original installation was put in, VLANs and digital IP cameras didn't even exist. That's what I'm workin' with here.

They also rented machines out for events and parties and such.\n\nThis place for the most part had actual competent techs working for it. Unfortunately, I wasn't so great at helping to move large items, and they needed that more than they needed a full time tech due to their rentals and events, therefore I had a relatively short period of employment there.\n\nOne day, we got a call from a bar that our shooting game was initially starting up okay when they turned it on upon opening up the bar, but later on it would black out and show \"no signal\" on the screen. (yes, some arcade monitors do that). We knew by the title, that this was one of those games that had a computer tower inside acting as the \"brain\" of the game rather than a custom arcade motherboard. This also meant that the tower in some cases used a standard ATX power supply, which we had several of laying round as spares for these types of games. \n\nAfter finding a power supply and verifying it worked using our tester, I headed over to the bar. \n\nIt was soon enough after opening that the machine had not shut itself down yet, but I decided to do some exploratory \"surgery\" on it rather than just wait around for it to go wrong. I opened the back cover with the key, and thankfully, there is plenty of room around the tower to take it's cover off while it's still in place. I popped the cover off, and I saw that the CPU fan wasn't turning anymore. Well, darn. I don't think we have a spare of that. On the other hand, we caught it before the actual CPU failed: score one for whoever designed this motherboard. Clearly the computer was going into thermal shutdown. \n\nI noted in the ticket that the CPU fan was broken, and I took pictures of both the fan itself and the model number on the computer tower case, so that we could figure out what fan to order, or find a broken tower of the same model to pull a fan from.\n\nEven with thermal throttling and shutdown, it's not wise to continue to run something that has improper cooling, because hitting the upper limit repeatedly is still a good way to cause failure sooner or later. The machine had a removable power cord, so I decided to take it with me - and let the bar manager know the reason I was taking it with me. He appeared to understand so I went on my way. I also made a call to the boss and explained the whole thing. \n\nFast forward about 4 weeks.\n\nWhile I was out replacing the monitor on another machine in a different location, I got a call from my boss. He said that (same shooting game) is broken down at (address) and just showing \"No Signal\" on the screen. The address sounded familiar, but I didn't make the connection in the moment. As I got closer to the location, the realization hit that it's the same one I had found the fan broken in..... But how did they even get to the point of saying \"No Signal\"? \n\nI entered the bar and just as I suspected, there was another power cord attached and plugged in. Sure enough, the screen is saying \"No Signal\". I tried to reboot it, however, instead of the single short \"beep\" that this machine usually made on startup, I get an ominous series of long beeps. I forget what the pattern was offhand, but it wasn't what you would want to hear when booting up a computer.\n\nI took the back cover off again and found that whoever put the new power cord on hadn't even closed up the tower so it was still open. More importantly, the fan was still broken, so the CPU had been started and forced to run up to it's limits multiple times. \n\nNormally, I would try reseating the RAM and possibly the CPU and graphics card to see if that fixes the problem. My hope of that working here was quite thin, knowing what's happened, but I might as well try something while I'm here. \n\nI pulled out the RAM first amd put it back in. No change. Then I tried the graphics card. No change. The thing I saved for last, because it's not a pleasant task due to the thermal paste, is the CPU. Well, whatever, I might as well get it over with. So, I unscrewed the heat sink, removed it, undid the lock on the CPU socket and removed the CPU, then put it back in and reattached the heat sink. Lights, Camera, Action! Power on and, just as I suspected, no change. I get the same error beeps. Drat. \n\nI called my boss to see if he knew anything about the power cord finding it's way back to the bar.\n\nIt turns out that he had gotten a call that \"the power cord is missing\" and he had just sent one of the other employees out there with another power cord, and that guy had just plugged it in, and when it booted up in front of him he (understandably) assumed all was well. However, neither that employee OR my boss had bothered to look at the ticket. The restaurant manager didn't mention anything either, and apparently assumed the problem was fixed or forgot what I had said, and didn't unplug the machine. \n\nI calmly reminded my boss to check the ticket from 4 weeks ago that had my name on it. After a moment of silence on his part, he surprisingly doesn't find a way to blame me, for once. Score one for him, but that's about all he got due to his generally poor attitude. Well, maybe two because he wouldn't have stood for the kind of crap that went on at the other game room store I had worked for previously. \n\nThe guy who didn't look at the ticket got an earful from the boss, but I don't think that was entirely fair because the boss could have checked the ticket himself, or the call-taker if it wasn't the boss. (I don't know who picked up the \"power cord is missing\" call). I told that employee that I didn't blame him.\n\nTL;DR: The crap hit the fan, but the fan wasn't working anymore so the crap just stayed there.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1667746036.0},{"title":"A 5 minute job.

Could be anytime from 2008ish onward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\nCustomer had an Apple laptop with a failing disk. I tried everything I could to get data off it. USB bridge to my own Macbook, directly connected to a PC with Linux or Windows HFS mount tools, various professional data recovery tools we \u201cdownloaded off the internet\u201d at the shop. I managed to get some files back but not all of what Customer was hoping for. I noticed one of these tools was making something like 5 attempts to read the file, timing out and giving up. Running the tool again maybe grabbed some different files but wasn\u2019t going to be time\/cost effective to just repeat it and hope for the best, scanning the entire disk for hours each time.\n\nThis gave me the idea to try something, similar to the data recovery tool but with the opposite intention. To transfer a file assuming it would take ages, or if it did fail to be able to set that file aside for another attempt, and not to waste time redoing successfully copied files. I\u2019d seen something do this already. I still can\u2019t believe this worked. But after 2 weeks of using Filezilla to FTP to a local hard drive I had pretty much everything Customer wanted.

Basically when a location doesn't own their own machines (usually places like restaurants and bars) a company like this either \"rents\" a space for said machine for a flat rate to the location owner, or splits the actual profits from the machine with the location owner.\n\nThis is not the same place that had idiotic techs working for it, that was a store that sold arcade machines.\n\nOne day, we got a call from a restaurant that our entire row of games had stopped working. Okay, that sounds more like a blown breaker in the building than a problem with any of our games. The location owner responded that he tried turning the breaker back on, but it instantly blew again. We offer to check our machines just to be sure, though we were skeptical that it was anything to do with us.\n\nMany arcade and vending machines will have their own fuses, either buried inside the machine, or in a separate little fuse holder in the back, near the power cord. So it seems unlikely that anything to do with our games, except a munched power cord, could actually take down a branch circuit.\n\nWithout going into great detail, I arrived and checked the power cords, which was easy since the machines had already been moved back from the wall. The power cords are fine. A few of our machines have an external fuse holder, so on a hunch, I pop one of them out.\n\nSome idiot had wrapped tinfoil around the fuse on this machine.  All of our techs at this place were well aware of what a fuse is for, and why this is a terrible idea. We always checked fuses on any machine that was new to us. I took pictures for my boss. The two other machines that had external fuse holders had the exact same thing done to them. The kicker was that only one of those machines even had a blown fuse, the other two were fine. I looked inside the machine where the blown fuse was bypassed, and there were several melted wires and the power supply board was fried. I took pictures of that as well.\n\nI delivered the boss the bad news, that (game) had several burned parts and there may be other unseen damage to the motherboard as well, and we wouldn't know until we replaced the obviously bad parts. The power supply board had actual traces burned so it would need to be entirely replaced.\n\nThe restaurant owner had cut corners in other ways while running the restaurant, and in this case, when (game) blacked out on a customer, he just popped out the fuse holder rather than calling the vending company (us) and then wrapped the fuse in tinfoil, rather than replacing it with the proper type. He then proceeded to do the same thing with the other two machines that had external fuse holders accessible from behind. The restaurant owner wouldn't have had to pay a dime for any repairs to the machines, anyway, so we really didn't get why he would do this. We never even gave keys to any location owner, partly to prevent them from screwing stuff up.\n\nOnce the boss found out what had been done with the machines, he put in a priority work order..... to remove ALL of our machines from that restaurant \"before they burn the place down and take our machines with them\". The restaurant surprisingly never burned down, but they did eventually go out of business after multiple code violations were discovered. I was not at all surprised.\n\nTL;DR: Restaurant owner tries to \"fix\" someone else's arcade machine by bypassing the fuse, ends up making it worse. Also goes for double Jeopardy by \"fixing\" the ones that aren't even broken. Restaurant ends up getting \"fired\" as a client due to their \"repairs\".","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1667420498.0},{"title":"I think adults were born since that was last true?","author":"SubstantialTerm3843","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/yk2mr3\/i_think_adults_were_born_since_that_was_last_true\/","text":"Not a shop story this time.

Native English speaker so please call me out if I make a mistake.\n\nReally quick cast:NG- Network GuyPO1- Police Officer 1PO2- Police Officer 2PC- Police ChiefCW1- Coworker 1CW2- Coworker 2S- Supervisor\n\nSo I work for a university helpdesk that supports the entire campus excluding a few specific places like the dorms. Today on my shift, I came into my shift and clocked in. As I was getting logged into all of our background systems and the phone queue, I was shown a ticket by CW1, CW2, and S. They could not believe what was going on and they piqued my curiosity.\n\nThe person who opened the ticket was PO1, our main point of contact at the station. The ticket reads\n\n**PO1** \\- \"I was told one of the officers switched the routers in Area X and Area Y. Area X continued to have internet with Area Y's router. They switched it back. They think it might be a cord issue. Can someone come verify? Thanks.\"\n\nI had to reread the post 3 times to make sure that I was comprehending it right. I could not believe that someone would touch enterprise-owned equipment without clearance. Keep in mind I am Tier 1 and the clearance to work anywhere near the network infrastructure is Tier 3.  After confirming that my mind was not in fact scrambling works and I read that correctly, I looked at the notes under it and just wow.\n\nThe next message literally just said:\n\n**NG** \\- \"You did what?\"\n\nThis is unusual. We are trained when we start working here that the messages we send through the ticketing software should follow a general email format like:\n\n*Hello \\[caller\\],*\n\n*\\[message\\]*\n\n*Thank you,*\n\n*\\[technician\\]*\n\nThe officer responded:\n\n**PO1** \\- \"That's what I am told. The PO2 asked PC before doing so, and PC approved. Unknown when it occurred.\"\n\nJust what?!!? What does that mean? No disrespect to our PC, they are a pretty awesome person who I have dispatched for in the past and they were always patient and kind to me. But I will say that this person needed help figuring out some very basic computer problems (can't really get specific due to the nature of the work). Apparently, a similar thought passed through our NG's head because his next message is pretty legendary:\n\n**NG** \\- \"This is not acceptable. Specialized equipment should not just be moved by those who don't know how to connect, troubleshoot, or handle specialized equipment. Time after time when we see issues with Area Y it's because either the dongle on the tablet is broken, or some officer has turned wifi off on the tablet. The other month we tested the cable in the squad and it came back \"pass\" in a certification test. What led to the decision to just make this change? Has the squad been not functioning for some time?\"\n\nThat made my work shift interesting. I have saved the ticket number so that I can keep looking back at it. I will update this post with what happens next as soon as there is more to tell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Hello everyone and thank you for your patience. I have an update.\n\nAccording to S, NG called PC and absolutely ripped into them. I was not there for the conversation but it was apparently pretty epic.\n\nWhat I do know is that the networking team ended up replacing both routers and the police station was given strict orders to talk to at least the helpdesk before they do anything like this again. Not the most climactic ending but I hope you enjoyed reading it.\n\nIt's unlikely that anything else will happen, but if by chance there is anything, I will update again.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1667273889.0},{"title":"Asian Persuasion","author":"SubstantialTerm3843","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/yj4mvu\/asian_persuasion\/","text":"Many years ago I worked for a small independent IT shop. I am not proud of my time, behaviour or attitude during those years. It was my first job in IT, I was in my mid 20s and the atmosphere of the place was absolutely toxic. We thought we were gods when we were clowns and cowboys.\n\nAll stories are around 15y ago and to the best of my memory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCast for this will be Me, MyBoss, AsianStudent, JapaneseStudent, EastEuropeanStudent. the nationalities don't really matter aside from me being half Japanese.\n\nOur shop used to do some work for some landlords who owned a few housing blocks marketed to students. Mostly 40-60 rooms each, and each building had internet advertised as included. Which was an 8Mb connection for a simple home internet package anyone might get for themselves at the time, certainly not to share for a block of flats. All connected to rooms by plain 10\/100 switches, or in some cases a managed switch on which we set traffic management rules as a division of the total speed of the internet on the port. Yes really. So if you\u2019re in one of 40 rooms serviced by a 8Mb connection?\n\n~~8096\/40= 202.4, so 202Kb\/s~~ thanks u\/Vektor0. 8196\/40 = 204.8 so 204Kb\/s for you. Omg looking back I cannot believe we did that. Omg\u2026 Omg.\n\nThis one however was a smaller building, 10-15 rooms and I think as it was one that was set up earlier on (before my time at the shop) it was only on 2Mb. Possibly back then 8Mb wasn\u2019t available in that area, lets go with that for this story but the only alternative is the landlords wouldn\u2019t pay for 8Mb. We had frequent complaints naturally which we ignored or said was the best we could offer, then ignored. Sometimes though, they would persist.\n\nThe tenants had come to complain again, as they had a few times already. AsianStudent was mostly the instigator, today she turned up with two more tenants to back her up.\n\nAsianStudent: \u201cThe internet is too slow, it\u2019s unacceptable\u201d\n\nMyBoss, Me: \u201cFor the thousandth time, it\u2019s not our problem. It\u2019s the best service you\u2019ll get in the area and you have to share\u201d\n\nAsianStudent: \u201cThe internet is much faster in \\[AsianCountry\\]!\u201d\n\nMyBoss, Me: \u201cWe\u2019re not in \\[AsianCountry\\]\u201d\n\nAsianStudent: \u201cIt\u2019s far to slow and we can\u2019t use it to study! And it\u2019s not fair, some of the tenants play games or download illegal videos\u201d\n\nMyBoss, Me: \u201cWe don\u2019t police the network, it\u2019s not our problem. We don\u2019t tell people what they can and cannot do with it. Besides it\u2019s no different from you having video skype calls back home to your family\u201d\n\nAsianStudent: \u201cTHAT ISN\u2019T THE SAME AT ALL!!\u201d\n\nMyBoss, Me: \u201cIt is from a networking perspective\u201d\n\nAsianStudent: \u201cIt\u2019s not the same at all!! I just want to speak to my family, the others are breaking the law!!\u201d\n\nMyBoss, Me: \u201cIn terms of network traffic it\u2019s no different to anything else, a constant stream of data\u201d\n\nAsianStudent: \u201cNo it isn\u2019t\u201d\n\nMyBoss, Me: \u201cWe are network engineers and we are telling you IT IS\u201d\n\nAhahahahaha, \u201cnetwork engineers\u201d. I \\*CRINGE\\* at these words. I wouldn\u2019t even describe myself as a network engineer now after over two decades in IT. The ARROGANCE. The HUBRIS. The NOT EVEN KNOWING HOW MUCH WE DIDN\u2019T KNOW. You might have been wondering why I start my stories the way I do. These are not just my TFTS. These are my confessions.\n\nAsianStudent: \u201cIf you won\u2019t fix it, we will get our own internet!\u201d\n\nMyBoss, Me: \u201cOk\u201d\n\nAsianStudent: \u201c..We will do it! Your internet is useless!\u201d\n\nMyBoss, Me: \u201cGo on then\u201d\n\nAsianStudent: \u201c..We are not joking! We will go to a competitor!\u201d\n\nAsianStudent continues to argue with MyBoss, who is undeterred by the threat of rebellion.\n\nJapaneseStudent and I have spoken before and he knows I speak Japanese. To my delight, so does EastEuropeanStudent. Fluently. Even better than I can if I remember right. We get into our own conversation in \\[Japanese\\] while MyBoss and AsianStudent carry on in English. AsianStudent does not understand Japanese.\n\nJapaneseStudent: \u201c\\[The internet really is slow and unacceptable\\]\u201d\n\nEastEuropeanStudent: \u201c\\[It really is a problem, is there nothing you can do?\\]\u201d\n\nMe: \u201c\\[I am sorry, but for the reasons we have repeated many times, this is the fastest service in the area and it is being shared. There is nothing we can do to improve it\\]\u201d\n\nEastEuropeanStudent: \u201c\\[And this idea of a second internet line?\\]\u201d\n\nMe: \u201c\\[You would need to have that conversation with your landlord, we don\u2019t make those decisions\\]\u201d\n\nJapaneseStudent: \u201c\\[But it is possible?\\]\u201d\n\nMe: \u201c\\[Of course. It\u2019s really just a matter of who is going to pay for it. We have no issue with how many lines go into the flats. But it\u2019s not for us to say how it\u2019s done. Your landlords I assume would pass on any further expenses to the tenants\\]\u201d\n\nEastEuropeanStudent: \u201c\\[What do you mean?\\]\u201d\n\nMe: \u201c\\[Well it will cost more money, and they are a business. They exist to make money not spend it. It isn\u2019t for me to discuss really but I assume they would pass on the charges for an extra line, and our work to get it all connected up\\]\u201d\n\nEastEuropeanStudent: \\[And if we do it ourselves? Without the landlord?\\]\u201d\n\nMe: \u201c\\[Well I would have thought you would need their permission. And the ISP may charge an installation fee..\\]\u201d\n\nNow if you have any awareness of Japanese culture, even if through nothing more than Kurosawa films and stereotypes, just know that those stereotypes aren\u2019t based on nothing. That whole thing about honour and shame isn\u2019t really true in the way it\u2019s depicted but it absolutely is a thing. My Japanese is far from perfect but I chose my words carefully..\n\nMe: \u201c\\[..also you would be in charge of the bill. One of you would have to give their name for the contract and become the account holder. Most ISPs have a minimum term of 12 months and as students, aren\u2019t you only in the flats for a total of nine or ten months? And you have already been there several months? You could find yourself in the situation where the others refuse to cooperate and one person has to pay the entire bill\\]\u201d\n\nJapaneseStudent: \u201c\\[That would not be fair!\\]\u201d\n\nMe: \u201c\\[But that it how it works when there is a SINGLE PERSON OF RESPONSIBILITY named on the account\\]\u201d\n\nWhat happened next would have earned me an A\\* for GCSE Drama right there. JapaneseStudent and EastEuropeanStudent immediately turn to look at AsianStudent and take a diagonal step backwards, putting distance between both her and myself. I don\u2019t know why they did it but it was just beautiful. Without words, without language, as if scripted for the stage. She has no idea what I just said but is faltering, having observed one of the most subtle yet powerful acts of rejection I have ever encountered in my life. Whatever she hoped for by bringing her neighbours in, she\u2019s just seen she\u2019s lost them.\n\nShe breaks off from MyBoss and asks me what is happening so I repeat it all for her benefit. She\u2019s not happy but shrug, I\u2019m not an ISP it\u2019s not my rules. JapaneseStudent and EastEuropeanStudent speak amongst themselves and I don\u2019t catch it but the fact they\u2019re not using English tells me all I need to know.\n\nWhat happened afterwards I don\u2019t recall. Suffice it to say next year\u2019s cohort moved in and we got the exact same complaints each year.\n\nA couple of notes.\n\nWe got this all the time. Yes it was terribly managed, yes I would have complained too in their position, yes we were not the good guys. But then again, I did end up telling another student who turned up three days in a row and threatened to call his daddy because daddy is a lawyer \u201cWe do not have a business agreement with you. You have a business agreement with your landlord, we have a business agreement with your landlord. WE don\u2019t offer YOU any kind of service at all, call your lawyer dad and get him to explain it to you\u201d.\n\nI did start tinkering with pfSense at one point and suggested to MyBoss we try some proper traffic management.\n\nMyBoss: \u201cLandlord will never pay for it\u201d\n\nAnd the per port speed limit thing? Like I say, I\u2019m confessing.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1667297005.0},{"title":"Onoz, my socks are irradiated!","author":"Raptorthrust","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/yived6\/onoz_my_socks_are_irradiated\/","text":"This is easily my favorite tech support story.  I've shared it a bunch of times, and I think I may even have the recording lying around somewhere (my supervisor sent it to me as a sort of trophy).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackground: Early in my tech support career, I worked at a contractor phone center providing Tier 1 support for multiple different companies.  One of these companies made long range radio sets (think like ham radios, long range comms, that kind of thing).  Most of the people who called us were company people who had a service account with them (these would be like logging companies who were in areas that had no cell service, or remote weather observation stations or whatever).  Occasionally we'd get a private caller who maybe owned a radio he got second hand or something, but that was the exception to the rule.  I should also add we didn't really do any actual tech support, we just gathered info and sent it to whatever support team handled the issue.  Finally, I will also mention that on occasion we would get bored and call in ourselves and prank our co-workers.  \n\n\nThe story: so I'm chilling in the office on a slow Saturday when a call comes in.  \n\n\nMe: Thank you for calling \\*company name\\* support, this is Raptor, may I have your first and last name please?\n\nCaller: \\*stammers out his name\\*\n\nThis guy sounded young, like late teen or college age, which is unusual since most of our callers are usually more middle-aged.  He also sounds really nervous, so I just assume he's a newbie who just screwed something up.  I punch in his name into the ticketing system and get no hits, pretty much confirming my suspicions.\n\nMe: I don't seem to be able to find your name in the system.  Is this the first time you've called?\n\nCaller: Uh, yes.\n\nMe: No problem, I just have to create a profile for you.  Can I have a good phone number for?\n\nCaller: \\*begins giving me a phone number, then stops midway through\\* (panicked voice) Um, can you just skip making the profile and help me?\n\nMe: Well, I can get you over to one of the support technicians, but I need more information first, like what kind of issue you're having.\n\nCaller: My microwave exploded and I think radiation is leaking into my room!\n\n(Some of you may see where this is going, trust me, it gets better).\n\nMe, not sure if I'm being pranked or not: I'm sorry?\n\nCaller: I was drying my socks in my microwave, and it exploded!  Now I don't know if my room is filling with radiation or what to do!\n\nI look around the office real quick to look for snickering co-workers, but everyone is either sitting idle or obviously on other calls.\n\nMe: I'm not sure I understand the nature of the issue or the reason for your call.\n\nCaller: I Googled your company name, and it says you're the #1 experts in microwave technology!\n\nMe: Um, sir?  I think that's referencing microwave radios?\n\nCaller: ....OK bye!  \\*click\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just kind of sit there in stunned silence before finally turning to my team lead and ask him to pull the recording of my last call.  He shrugs and says  no problem.  Minutes later he's laughing his butt off.  When he finishes he confirms it wasn't a prank and definitely real.  \n\n\nWe never heard from nuclear socks man again.

Or, why they call it a \"burn-in\" test","author":"dickcheney600","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/yidqqn\/whats_that_smell_or_why_they_call_it_a_burnin_test\/","text":"I used to work on this display\/control panel device that, in the field, would be hooked up to a larger system. The larger system provided DC power to it, so we had a lab power supply that could provide a DC voltage to whatever we were testing. Both the voltage and current limit were adjustable and showed up on the PS's display.\n\nThe device I was working on had the display no longer lighting up, but if you shined a flashlight on it or tilted it the right way, you could still see the image, it was just that the backlight was out. It was on a separate power supply circuit, which wasn't a separate board or module in this case. This company actually did component level repairs on the circuit boards, and we had test equipment to facilitate this kind of troubleshooting. \n\nThe backlight was the older fluorescent type which ran on around 500V if I remember correctly. In training, I was told that our multimeters couldn't withstand that voltage. This didn't make sense because both the meters and the probes themselves were rated for up to 1000V, but who knows, my trainer probably found out the hard way that in practice, it couldn't take it.\n\nAs a result, we just replaced both the transformer and the switching transistor at the same time when there was a problem with the backlight not getting power, assuming a known good display did not light up. I had already done that test, so I replaced both of those parts and put the whole device back together.\n\nI plugged it back in and it worked fine. All buttons and controls work, what more do you expect? I left the thing turned on while I filled out the \"paperwork\" or should I say computer work on the device. \n\nAfter I've finished documenting what I did to repair the device, I start to notice a burning smell. I look at all my equipment including the device I just repaired, and everything is still on. Did I leave my soldering iron turned on? Nope, it's off. \n\nI get up from my desk and start looking around for anything that's either smoking or just has the screen flickering. As I walk away, I notice the smell is weaker away from my desk than near it. \n\nThis is weird. Usually, by the time something has started to smell bad, the device in question would have already quit working. So where the heck is this smell coming from? Well, time to start sniffing things more closely.\n\nComputer tower? Nope. Monitor? Nope. Power supply? Nope. My display\/control panel? Bingo! \n\nOkay, now to narrow down the source of the smell. Again, we did component level repairs here rather than replacing a board whenever possible. Thankfully, we weren't expected to patch traces that were damaged, however. \n\nIt turns out there are capacitors right next to the transistor that I had to replace, and said capacitors are relatively heat sensitive, so it is easy to break them when soldering near them. In this case, they failed in a rather odd way where they were electrically \"leaky\" that is, they let some amount of current flow through them, causing them to heat up and emit a burnt odor. However, in this case it wasn't enough to actually trigger the overcurrent protection in either the unit itself or the lab power supply. Therefore everything appeared fine except for the burnt smell.\n\nAfter replacing those capacitors everything still worked fine and the smell was gone.\n\nTL;DR: Sometimes even working equipment can emit a burning smell depending on what's wrong with it.\n\nEdit: typo","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1667226575.0},{"title":"I work for monsters","author":"TigwithIT","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/yivwyb\/i_work_for_monsters\/","text":"Good evening TFTS,\n\nI write this in light of Halloween and i feel it appropriate for the day. Let me start of with the company i work for decided to get an MSP involved who tried to install a firewall at one of my sites and failed for 2 days only to put back the old firewall. Then after the building getting struck by lightning frying half the equipment all over. Flying off in a jet plane the next morning.\n\nToday i was finishing quotes for a bid on a hotel that is a small 36 inn suite in a small beach town. They are updating their cabling and needed some quotes on the fly. So i took time out of my day to rush them some numbers so they could know what to expect.\n\nMe: Hey PM i have the numbers for you we are running into an issue with the Wifi and the cameras due to the age of the systems, so we will need to purchase new unless we try to mix and match which would cut cost but doesn't make much sense.\n\nPM: Hey IT, i get it, go ahead and push out the numbers, i found a document from the management company check your email.\n\nI get an email with an enlarged photo taken on a screenshot from someone's phone of the rules that now look like a billboard poster on my screen. I scroll through it all to find 90 day retention and camera budget as many as affordable.\n\nMe: Ok well the system we are building you can use any camera as long as you upgrade the CPU if they go above 22 cameras i would add on a couple hundred for the machine so we can accommodate the extra cameras, you can literally pick any ONVIF brand or POE versed camera.\n\nThe phone rings, it is the PM with an IT from one of this managed companies properties.\n\nAdmin: Hi, glad i can get on the phone with you guys so nice to talk, so we have this cloud based solution at our hotel, we use no onsite equipment system runs great it is this company and this is the name, we already work with them. We use this kind of network pipe.\n\nThey have a 2 gig pipe, their camera system is 40k for 14 cameras with 90 days retention cloud based, and for all your horror lovers.\n\nAdmin: Yea so, if you are going to do that just know that management company and MSP company will require a second firewall on the network. One firewall for their admin traffic behind or in front of your firewall for guest network and voip.\n\nMe: So we already have it segmented via vlans and everything is secure. They literally separate their traffic at all sites by manual hardware segmentation?\n\nAdmin: Yep, that is how they work. Did they ever come back to install their firewall again after they tried the first time.\n\nMe: Ok well.... that sounds great and no they never showed up again so i assume this will be brought up in the project in the next month or so.\n\nOur site has 150 meg fiber pipe, 36 rooms, and the current quote for onsite system with 90 day retention and cloud backups is around 7k. They already have VPN's and a fortigate suite setup with everything needed as well as ACL's and an overkill'ed security on endpoint as well.\n\nMaybe it is time i step in the grave, this shit is literally killing me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: We are supposedly force to use their management company \/ IT company. Their meeting still hasn't gotten us quotes we asked for weeks ago and they gave us some ridiculous lead time like up to 8 months. In this time i have given them non approved vendors that can have them the same equipment in weeks or days. Also it was found out the TV's being ordered were not supposed to go to one vendor but another as dictated by the owners. The laugh of all of it is we are just getting the equipment ordered to be there, there is literally zero words from the management company how it will be installed, by who, and or if their IT company will really even be able to do anything. 3pm tomorrow will be an interesting conversation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate after meeting: So apparently we are following management \/ IT company guidelines but we can go with whatnot equipment. They are going with some of the companies i got on the fly, their company is still off somewhere doing something, maybe chasing butterflies? I'm finishing a cable quote for cameras and spending two days for configuration and hanging which should be more than enough. They still did consider that obscene camera quote but it was more of a prodding at it with everyone in the room. Still plan on doing a now 10k setup for cameras, 90 day cloud backed up data, and a hardware agnostic system. We are being realistic and planning for some things to show up later, but all core infrastructure and core equipment will be in place.

Because IE is now discontinued by Microsoft, those aps have been ported over to Edge but still do not work in Chrome.  We do, however, have Chrome installed by default on all PCs due to it's popularity, and just use desktop icons that force the custom apps to use Edge by default.  I'll also be using the terms bookmarks and favorites interchangably in this post.\n\nNow on to the tale.\n\nWe recently forced a company-wide script that disabled IE and replaced it with Edge.  Of course chaos ensued.\n\nI just had a caller that complained that their bookmarks\/favorites aren't in Edge. They were supposed to be automatically imported by Edge, but apparently his weren't.  Of note, this user had never used Chrome and never wanted to use Chrome.\n\nSo I walk him through manually triggering the built-in process for importing favorites from IE to Edge.  The process completes and ... nothing.  No bookmarks.\n\nRemote access time.  Fearing that my instructions weren't clear enough I remotely into his PC to trigger the Edge import process myself and ... nothing. It didn't work.  For whatever reason Edge won't import favorites from IE.\n\nNext I confirm that the IE bookmarks are there.   He has tons.  He works in procurement and has loads of sites bookmarked for ordering products.\n\nWTF, don't tell me that I have to copy and paste the bookmarks manually!\n\nThen inspiration strikes.  I open Chrome, create a bookmark, then open Edge and import bookmarks from Chrome.  Success!  Edge successfully imported from Chrome.  But it still won't import from IE.\n\nSo I once again open up Chrome and use it to import the IE favorites, then close Chrome and use Edge to import the favorites from Chrome.  Success!  User has all of his favorites now.  As a bonus they're also now in Chrome, so if they ever decide to use a real browser, his favorites will be waiting.\n\nIt's a round-about process, but it works. I still find it crazy that I couldn't import from IE to Edge though.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1667240261.0},{"title":"\"It's the only thing I have left to rule out please don't shout at me\"","author":"SubstantialTerm3843","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/yi8648\/its_the_only_thing_i_have_left_to_rule_out_please\/","text":"Many years ago I worked for a small independent IT shop. I am not proud of my time, behaviour or attitude during those years. It was my first job in IT, I was in my mid 20s and the atmosphere of the place was absolutely toxic. We thought we were gods when we were clowns and cowboys.\n\nAll stories are around 15y ago and to the best of my memory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCast will be Me, Customer, his daughter and MyBoss\n\nI'd done jobs for Customer for a while, a good guy and we got on well. I'd been to his home a few times, once spent aaaaaages dicking around trying to set something up that should have been simple but refused to take. Tried to charge him for the work completed and he insisted on paying me for the time taken instead, three times what I'd asked for. \n\nI have this theory that most people, whatever it is they do, are always tweaking and messing with it. Always tinkering, honing their skills, fixing previous mistakes or misconceptions after learning something new. My personal home lab is perpetually 85% complete. And like me Customer's thing was similarly always never quite finished, never just so. Customer though is an architect, his home was his thing. It was beautifully done but have a look around and you'd see bricks and cement stacked up by where the front steps should be, half built. At one point he moved and I asked about all the work he put in to the old place, he said he'd moved his family out temporarily to \u201cbuild a third floor\u201d on it which is not something I thought you could do. But then again I would never have thought to question it before.\n\nCustomer: \u201cHi, after I moved house that PC you built for me doesn\u2019t work. It starts booting Windows and then reboots\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cOk bring it in we\u2019ll have a look\u201d\n\nI stick it on a bench at the shop. It boots first time.\n\nMe: \u201cSeems to be working fine. You moved house yeah? I\u2019ll reseat a few things and screw them back in, sometimes things wiggle loose in transport\u201d\n\nCustomer: \u201cok thanks, I\u2019ll try again\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCustomer: \u201cI\u2019ve got it back and plugged it all in and it\u2019s doing the same again\u201d\n\nCustomer brings it back to the shop. Again it boots first time. I go through the usual explanation of trying to diagnose intermittent problems and can\u2019t fix what ain\u2019t broke which he accepts. But he does ask me to come up and see it in situ which is fair and I\u2019m happy to do.\n\nI pop up and he\u2019s not in, his daughter answers the door and says dad has said he\u2019ll be home late and just to crack on. I barely recognise her, I\u2019ve not seen her in a while and she\u2019s grown up, must be in her late teens now. I go to his office, boot it up.. and it does exactly what he\u2019s described. POSTs, begins booting Windows, then boot cycles. Damn. I troubleshoot, can\u2019t fix it and don\u2019t drive so leave a message with Customer\u2019s daughter that I\u2019ve seen the issue for myself and to call me.\n\nThe PC ends up back at the shop, I end up back at his home again, the thing even comes back home with me once to see if there\u2019s anything just weird going on that I can observe. And roger a codger the damn thing boots fine every time, except in his office. He takes it back again and calls from home. Understandably he\u2019s frustrated to find it still won\u2019t boot.\n\nCustomer: \u201cLook we\u2019ve been back and forth over this for weeks, it still doesn\u2019t work and I\u2019m getting sick of this\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYeah I know, I am really sorry but it just doesn\u2019t have any issues when we try it, but I have seen it happen it\u2019s not as if I don\u2019t believe you\u201d\n\nCustomer: \u201cSo what are we going to do about it then?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cWell, the one common thing about it not booting is when it\u2019s in your office. Can you try it somewhere else in the home, or at your neighbour\u2019s?\u201d\n\nCustomer takes the sharp inhale of breath he\u2019ll need to tell me what he thinks of this suggestion.\n\nMe: \u201cNow, before you say anything I just want you to know that if anyone had ever told me to do what I\u2019ve just asked you to do, I would tell them to GET. F\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*CKED. But it\u2019s the only place it happens and the last thing I have to rule out\u201d\n\nUnhappily, he agrees. No happier but very much more chill, he calls back.\n\nCustomer: \u201cOk, so I took it to my neighbour\u2019s and tried it an you\u2019re right it boots first time. Sorry for the runaround and all that\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine, I\u2019m just glad we got it sorted out\u201d\n\nCustomer: \u201cWell it gave my wife a good laugh and I\u2019m going to look at the electrical wiring\u201d\n\nMyBoss told me soon after Customer had been back in insisting that we take some payment for the time we put into it, I don\u2019t remember if he accepted or not. I do not ask Customer if by any chance the power socket in the office was one he fitted himself. I also do not ask him how old his daughters are now. It's just that seeing her made me think they must be nearly old enough to be leaving home for university. And the old house is still in progress.

In addition to SLAs for corporate customers, we used to maintain a 24\/7 callout roster for phone services that were deemed urgent (emergency services, doctors, people with medical issues etc). It was a regulatory requirement that for every fault report the operators had to ask if there was anybody in the house with a medical condition, but couldn't ask for details due to privacy laws. \\[EDIT: I can't recall the exact wording of the script, but it was along the lines of urgent, serious, significant, life threatening etc\\](important later).\n\nAnyway, its Christmas day. I've just sat down to Christmas lunch (Summer in Australia so the main Christmas gathering for most families) with my extended family visiting from hours away and in-laws visiting from overseas when I get a call about a priority fault. Customer with medical issues on a rural property has phone issues and the linesperson they initially dispatched couldn't find anything wrong.\n\nSo off I go approx. an hour drive (roads are clear though because everyone else is home with their families having lunch) and knock on the door where surprise, surprise I have interrupted their entire extended family having Christmas lunch.\n\nCheck the phone line and it's got dial tone, it's clear, I can call out and call in. Linesperson notes indicate no battery or earth faults and other than being a long run due to being rural, it's a good line.\n\nThen the wife says, ***\"Well why won't the new computer connect to the internet?\"***. Dig a little deeper and it turns out the line is fine but they got the grandkids a computer for Christmas but can't figure out how to set up the PC and modem for dial up internet. (We were not the ISP they were trying to sign up with BTW). So they have called phone faults and logged a fault. ***\"So what is the urgent medical condition?\"***  *I ask, a*nd she replies ***\"Oh my husband has had surgery from scratching his eye on a rose bush and has to wear an eye patch until it heals. They only asked if someone had a medical issue. Not what it was\"***\n\nI explain very firmly that this is not a legitimate call out, that there could have been someone else legitimately in need of help and that the computer or internet connection was never part of their service agreement.  The response is ***\"but we didn't want to disappoint the children on Christmas day\"***. Didn't even have the decency to look embarrassed when I pointed out that they had ruined Christmas day for my family and that of the linesperson that had attended earlier. Then had the gall to ask if I would have a look at the computer anyway \"**S*****ince I was there and didn't want to waste a trip\"***\n\nPolitely declined and because of the regulatory framework we couldn't even charge them for an incorrect call out.

They are the only people authorized to call the people on call after hours if it\u2019s an emergency. The help desk person called me at 1:30am and woke my ass up to let me know a user was having some wireless connectivity issues.

Sigh\u2026. \n\nIf any of you are wondering how I resolved this, I politely told her, \u201cma\u2019am we guarantee maximum signal strength inside of the clinic\u201d and if you would like to access our secured network you need to be inside of the clinic. \n\nI then reminded her that she is authorized (and I checked her AD account to make sure she was a member of the Citrix VDA remote group) to access our network remotely. We use a 2 factor authentication with google authentication and the google Authenticator. \n\nI checked Citrix Director and she used it not even a week ago.

They are not new to it, and this is a common issue they address because people lock their ad accounts up when they fat finger their keyboards when working remotely and when on site. They also add the groups to ad accounts once remote access is approved for that particular user from their department Director. \n\nWe usually have 1-2 helpdesk representatives after hours, and they work solely at night and that is their normal shift.

According to the minimal ticket documentation, he changed \"network configuration\" and then tried to reset the network as part of troubleshooting.  Mr Potatohead, what did you do?\n\nKeep checking. Open services. I notice  networking services are stopped. **All of them. In fact, many basic windows services are stopped, and wont start.** Open the list of services that load when windows starts. All normal, windows is set to boot normally. This keeps getting weird. \n\nNext step, check service dependencies. I follow the thread of dependencies upwards and find the culprit. A very basic windows dll failed to start. Description marks it as corrupt or missing. \n\nFor those with fulfilling social lives, this files are vital for windows to work. Multiple components depends on the dlls, and naturally, windows will not simply let you delete, alter or move this files from its folder, system32.  And somehow Mr Potatohead managed to. Somehow potatohead managed to turn what would be a simple five minute fix into a whole day backup, restore and reimage process.  I still have half a mind to hunt him down and ask him how and why he did this, when he should have simply escalated. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The end.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAddenum: As I was writing this I got to thinking, maybe its nor Mr Potatohead's fault. Maybe that windows dll failed and the first thing it took was the printer spooler service. Its believable that before a reboot the networking services kept running. Still, I think its way funnier to blame the Service Desk Agent.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1667008098.0},{"title":"I know why your product doesn't work and it just makes me very sad.","author":"SubstantialTerm3843","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/yfpdg1\/i_know_why_your_product_doesnt_work_and_it_just\/","text":"Many years ago I worked for a small independant IT shop. I am not proud of my time, behaviour or attitude during those years. It was my first job in IT, I was in my mid 20s and the atmosphere of the place was absolutely toxic. We thought we were gods when we were clowns and cowboys.\n\nAll stories are around 15y ago and to the best of my memory. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCast for this is Me, Client, MyBoss and collectively StartupGuys, who I believe were two guys, one StartupGeek one SalesGuy. I spoke almost exclusively with the SalesGuy\n\nClient for this one was a hair and beauty salon. Very nice people. StartupGuys had come to them to offer their product which was a sort of customer history with pictures website. They had a photobooth thing that would add a picture of the customer to their record to review later. I think the idea was the customer would come in weeks or months after their last appointment and find their record, and say they wanted their hair done \"like last time, but with more whatever\".\n\nThe deal between Client and StartupGuys was no money changing hands, but the Client would be their first customer and test case. StartupGuys would use this success to showcase to future clients.\n\nClient asks us to support them getting all this set up on the network. I go down to assess what we're working with. Somewhere there is a server, the photobooth thing, a router and three mini PCs connected to a small touchscreen terminal each, smaller than a sheet of paper with a very wide, deep bezel that stands off the screen by an inch. Making it very hard to get into the edges or corners with a fingertip. Like where the the Start button is, FOR EXAMPLE. The mini PCs have been wedged into the existing furniture, into small wooden drawers that also held the hairdresser's tools of the trade. Covered in hair, sprays\/oils\/foams etc.\n\nWe went down to look at various things over many visits, over maybe a couple of months. So much of it blurs together now but I'll recall the fun details. MyBoss and I have concluded early on this whole thing is a hopeless mess, but MyBoss thinks it doesn't hurt to make some money off it so nonchalantly gives me the go ahead to assist as needed. This isn't a linear story, more a list of things I encountered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst I think SalesGuy says they've had problems with the network. So I take a seat in front of the touchscreen, raising both my hands out of muscle memory. I pause. Something is wrong. I can't place it immediately. You know when there's just a lapse of cognitive processing in a situation like you've hit a brick wall, but don't know why? Like if someone gave you a PIN for a credit card with a digit too short and your brain simply waits for the universe to make sense?\n\nMe: \"uhhhh....\"\n\nMyBoss: \"Where is keyboard?\"\n\nMe: \"..OSK?\"\n\nMyBoss: \"Where?\"\n\nMe: \"....system32?\"\n\nWe find the on screen keyboard and start getting the StartupGuys network mapped out. Eventually we find their router (in another drawer full of hair and.. sticky) and plug the building LAN into StartupGuys WAN. I'm not 100% sure but I may have also set DHCP up to not match the scope for the building network. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe leave for the day after getting the basics working, getting the odd call now and then to see if we can help. All along MyBoss breezily telling me to give SalesGuys enough to get on with. MyBoss will be milking the situation as far as he can. Weeks into the project SalesGuy calls with another support question.\n\nSalesGuy: \"Can you help with something? We can access our website on the server but not from the terminals\"\n\nMe: \"ok.. it's all behind your router, all on the same network?\"\n\nSalesGuy: \"Yeah but..\"\n\nMe: \"I'll have a look\"\n\nI head to the client. The website is accessible from the terminals but elements are missing.\n\nSalesGuy: \"What does that mean?\"\n\nMe: \"I.. it's your server, your website. I don't know what's wrong with it\"\n\nSalesGuy: \"But why doesn't it work?\"\n\nClient, MyBoss: \"Can you help him?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not a software person, I don't code, I don't debug, I don't even know if I'm using the right terminology for this (and still don't as I type this up right now)\"\n\nClient, MyBoss: \"Can you just like.. TRY?\"\n\nSeriously? Ok I'll \"try\" to fix something I know absolutely nothing about with all of you hovering over my shoulder ffs I have no idea what I'm supposed to do I hate you I hate it here this is insane wtf am I supposed to do about this ummm rightclick (on the touchscreen, so long press for a rightclick menu), view source I GUESS?? Scroll through StartupGuys webpage HTML maybe?? omg this is awful go away stop staring at me while I work this is impossible why am I doing this where is StartupGeek shouldn't he be doing this omg omg internal scream I want to go home... OH.\n\nVia a series of poker faces, eyeball movements, eyebrow raises and subtle nods, I direct MyBoss to see what I see and gain permission to explain what I have discovered.\n\nMe: \"You can't use a href=\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\....\" on a website, unless you're viewing it from the server. It's pointing at it's own C: drive. On any other PC it will be looking in that computer's own C:, not your C:\"\n\nSalesGuy: \"...\"\n\nMe: \"Tell StartupGeek to figure out remote vs local file storage and links\"\n\nI gave him some extra help with this. But to give you an idea of how useless we all were at this I think I told him to use \\\\\\\\fileshare\\\\path. I can't remember now, but they managed to get it working with the local\/remote nudge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think it's now getting on to a month since this whole thing started and it's still not workable. Double NAT and port forwarding is explained. And configured for them, naturally. As this is not our project we are treating it more as an amusing circus show. At this point however, I actually start to see what shape it's all going to take.\n\nMe: \"So.. The customer just searches for themselves to bring up their details?\"\n\nSalesGuy: \"Yup! Simples!\"\n\nMe: \"Where do they log in?\"\n\nSalesGuy: \"They don't need to\"\n\nMe: \"But how do they access their unique profile and bring up all their hist... oh... with the pictures and everything?\"\n\nSalesGuy: \"Yep!\"\n\nMe: \"Accessible online?\"\n\nSalesGuy: \"Yeah!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe project was eventually abandoned, Client didn't want to spend any more time on it. Or money, we were offered all of the equipment in lieu of payment which MyBoss agreed to. So we pack up a few bags of greasy kit caked in human hair. The \"server\" we found out was an XP PC in a thin case, those half height PCI bracket ones locked in the base of the photobooth cabinet. And the camera is a simple 2007ish era webcam built into the frame. As we're packing up, a thought occurs to me.\n\nMe: \"Hey, Client. Those pictures we saw when we were testing the website.. would you have actually been able to tell what your customers wanted, months later, from that quality of photograph?\"\n\nClient, does a thinky and starts giggling: \"No.. I don't suppose I could\"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1666966592.0},{"title":"Companies deliberately make your job difficult and life hard","author":"scoldog","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/yfd7cw\/companies_deliberately_make_your_job_difficult\/","text":"I work at a large car dealership.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, one of the manufacturers told us we needed to upgrade our service programming tablets to newer models to handle their latest software for the service and pre-delivery departments.  They threatened us with non-compliance fines if we didn't have it done ASAP.\n\nGetting electronics updated during the middle of a global supply shortage thanks to COVID was no cake walk (and still isn't), but we managed to upgrade all of our workshop programming tablets and the manufacturer left content.\n\nFast forward to two months ago, this manufacturer issues a recall notice for one of their cars.  As part of the recall, they demand a sound recording for the warranty case.  They supplied the workshops with microphones to plug into the tablets to record whatever sounds they need.  Problem is, they supplied microphones with 3.5MM jacks.  Like most modern electronics, the new tablets don't have onboard 3.5MM jacks.\n\nAha, I hear most of you say, why don't you just use a Bluetooth adapter, or a USB-C to 3.5MM jack adapter?  \n\nWell, the manufacturer thought of this.  The software they use for this recall checks what model tablet you have when you open it.  If you don't have a tablet that's on their \"authorised device list\" (among other requirements, a tablet with an onboard 3.5MM jack), it will refuse to run, adapter or not.  \n\nThe really insane thing was that the tablets we have from the beginning of the year were Samsung SM-T876B's, yet one of the authorised devices on their list was Samsung SM-T870 which is the same model as far as I can tell just with slight differences.  Still won't work thanks to the model number difference.\n\nAfter trying to get this company to understand the problem but failing miserably, I had to go dig through the tech junk pile.  Like a lot of IT people, I have a pile of stuff that is obsolete but still works fine and kept 'just in case'.\n\nI came up with a few older SM-P600's, which amazingly were on their authorised list. Fired them up to make sure they were working and sent them to the service departments. So now our service departments are running tablets with the latest version of Android alongside one tablet running Android 5 for warranty purposes.  The problem I have now is that each service department has only one of these warranty tablets.  If it fails or dies, I can't replace it.\n\nI'm contemplating joining the Amish.\n\n\nEDIT:  A few people keep asking this question.  None of the model numbers on the authorised list were upgrades from the tablets rolled out at the beginning of the year.  They were mostly all downgrades, the only reason they were on the list was because they were older models with onboard 3.5MM jacks.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1666929464.0},{"title":"Is it plugged in on both ends?","author":"btw_i_use_ubuntu","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/yffdj6\/is_it_plugged_in_on_both_ends\/","text":"This one is pretty simple but it's funny.

I look at the ticket notes and see that He's plugging in his router and any devices that connect to the router's wifi network are saying \"connected with no internet\". I checked the port on our device and saw that there was no link. I asked the customer to check that the cable was plugged in all the way on both ends. He checks this and confirms it is as it should be. I then ask if he can try a different cable. He asks which one I want to replace, which throws me off a little bit. I explain it's the one going from the ethernet jack into the yellow port on his router. This seems to confuse him as well, so I ask for more information and eventually get him to be send in a picture. It turns out that he had two different patch cables and he had plugged one of them into the ethernet jack and the other into the router, leaving the other end of both cables disconnected. I had him remove one of the cables and use a single cable to connect both devices together. Once he does this, the port immediately links up and his router is able to get online.

He tried using the end customer credential's on the technician's app. I told him to use his own credentials and reminded him what his username was. He tried on the end users' app and then on the technician's app. Sigh. He realises he does not know the password after all.\n\nI had him go thru the self login-help to get the password reset link but he kept either typing his username wrong or entering it in the wrong spot.

One of the unit commanders was a one-star General, high up in the military. He was a friendly human with a great sense of humor.\n\nOne day I got called into his office; it was a bit concerning since he had never asked for help - his Chief of Staff \/ Assistant would usually fix everything for him before it got to us. When I walked into his office, I noticed that his computer monitor was flipped upside down and was balancing between a few stacks of paperwork, and the back of the monitor was leaning against a wall. It was very unsteady and would fall if I tapped the desk hard enough. But, the balancing act did indeed work. I looked at his screen, and it was right side up. So I press Ctrl + Alt + Left a few times to correct the display, then I take his monitor and put it right side up. He looked at me with a blank stare that I will never forget and said, 'Thank you.'\n\nLater down the road, I found out that his Chief of Staff flipped his display as a joke and insisted he didn't know how to fix it.

I worked the night shift so I didn't get a lot of calls most nights.\n\nHowever, one night a lady calls in and said that her internet has been crappy the past few days but that she's been home sick since the day before and couldn't watch her soap operas.  She hadn't watched them in years but as she was sick and would be home sick for a while she wanted to get her internet working.

I am not proud of my time, behaviour or attitude during those years. It was my first job in IT, I was in my mid 20s and the atmosphere of the place was absolutely toxic. We thought we were gods when we were clowns and cowboys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll stories are around 15y ago and to the best of my memory. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCast for this is Me, MyBoss, ClientBoss, DBGuys, and collectively ClientSecretaries\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo one Wednesday after a long weekend off, I go back in to work. MyBoss asks me to head down to the client site and have a look at their problem they've had since Friday. MyBoss has been down on the Friday, Saturday, Monday and Tuesday to show his face and look involved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMyBoss: \"They can't access their CRM thingy, it's not our problem. The DBGuys from the place that built it for them say it's a network issue but I can ping the server and that's fine, it's a database problem. Just go and have a look for appearances sake and we can say we're sparing no effort to look at it\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, off I go with the customary amount of required information to achieve my goal, easy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Hi everyone, so just for fun lets start from the beginning for my sake, just tell me what's going on please?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClientSecretaries: \"We can't access anything on the system, we can't see any of the appointments or make new ones\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClientBoss: \"I'm going spare, please do what you can anything please. I've got the DBGuys down here looking at it too and they're convinced it's a network issue\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClientBoss is AGITATE. I get the picture. For anonymity no details, but this guy's business is expensive rates for well off clients for bookings from an hour to a half day. All the shiny suits who spend their bank holidays in a polo shirt and shorts washing their Audi, and their trophy wives, spend a lot of money for relatively short appointments. Anything less than perfect service is an embarassment. Client has no way of keeping track of who and when and what, they don't even know how much business they're losing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Ok, so let's try a few things\" tries ping from reception PC to server, works fine \"and it's the same for all of you?\" my one\/many\/all question, who is this affecting? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nClientSecretaries: \"We can't get on but they can up in the office\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWut. Well this is new. MyBoss had not mentioned this. Around this point I see the DBGuys. We are not introduced, ClientBoss is too distracted for anything like that. But the air has changed. The situation is not as described. My professional survival instincts and ego silently exchange places. DBGuys and I do not make direct eye contact but the sense of us versus them is tangible. They are onsite, I am beginning to understand, after a GET HERE NOW type phone call from ClientBoss, and heads will roll today. We both glance at each other through our peripheral vision. We both know, and know they know, and know they know we know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Righty ho then, let's have a look\" sure enough PCs in the office work fine. The server is in the office. Huh. \"I'm just going to start tracing what's going on, thanks\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy trace is I trace the cables. The reception PCs connect to a simple 8 port 10\/100 switch which in turn connect to another simple 8 port switch in the office. Which we almost certainly sold them. For those who know, it's a Netgear. The white ones, not the blue ones. And I see it. Oh teh noes, I see it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: \"So when did this start?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClientSecretaries: \"After the powercut\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen everything lost power. Oh teh noes. That would explain why the port on the cheap consumer grade switch connecting to the reception switch is lit orange instead of green. They've negotiated the link at 10mbs not 100mbs. More than enough for some simple ping packets, but not for their client management system. Oh teh noes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: \"I'm just going to make a quick call\" - OUTSIDE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: \"blah blah blah\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMyBoss: \"oh...\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: \"so the fix is to powercycle it, ClientBoss has no idea about tech but he knows what turn it off and on again means..\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMyBoss: \"Can you just.. \\*try\\* it?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: \"umm.. well do or do not really isn't it? There is no \\*try\\*\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMyBoss: \"ok do it and do your best\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks. Really, Thank you MyBoss. So off I go, powercycle a switch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Can you try it now please?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClientSecretaries: \"Oh yeah it's working now!!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClientBoss has overheard this. DBGuys almost certainly have too. ClientBoss skips over with a hesitant but growing smile. Given the situation I can only see his face as a hideous maelstrom of panic and hope fighting for dominance and I am the face this face will question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClientBoss: \"Is it working??\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Seems so now, yes\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClientBoss \"....What was wrong with it??\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery human who was once ever a child will recall a time a parent or teacher asks a question in a certain tone of voice. Every human who was once ever a child will recall that sensation of having fleeting nanoseconds to offer an answer that will be plausible and innocent enough to avoid BIG. TROUBLE. God's own atomic clock was ticking for me. I had nothing. I had absolutely nothing. Nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I've resynchronised your switch, ClientBoss\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho tf said that? omg it was me, what is happening?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClientBoss: \"...\" \\*non-comprehending head spasm, terrifying look of mad glee\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"One side of your switch was communicating with the other side of your switch at a different speed\", I offer some hand gestures so represent something being higher than the other \"so I've resyncronised it so they can talk together properly\" bring my hands level and tap my fingertips together \"and that seems to have fixed it\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe being within me that emerges only to protect us in times of mortal peril rests now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClientBoss: \"...but it's working now, yeah?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI simply smile and nod. I've learned in my career sometimes people don't want the techy gibberish. They want to see your confidence. They can offload their fears if you look like you know what you're doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClientBoss, grinning: \"ok I'll tell these DBGuys they can go home, cheers!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI take my leave instantly, before I burst out laughing. I get back to the shop for a debrief. MyBoss's pride is wounded, but we've gotten away with it.

(This\u2019ll teach you to ask for more!)\n\nI was asked to share more stories so I figured I would throw another one out there. Here is what you need to know if you are just joining. I worked at a larger tech company as a build engineer. The company did not follow best practices and the managers were\/are in way over their heads. This is the story of the first red flag project from my Team Lead. I supported hundreds of Devs and projects.\n\nThe actors are the Clown (AKA Team Lead), Other Engineer, Junior Engineer.\n\nSo the previous Build Engineer Lead bailed and left me and my colleagues there to pick up the pieces. He was nice and professional about it (and I do keep in touch with him).\n\nThe team was restructured and I was transferred there since I was already writing code to help with the builds and database deployments. Soon Clown is hired as Lead (from off the street). Other Engineer was also hired on shortly after.\n\nClown suggested we set up an artifact repository and use Maven conventions so we can be consistent (That is an important\/relevant detail). This is a good move for us. At this point Clown has my trust. He has a good resume and does a decent job of BSing with the right tech jargon. The management is dazzled. The team is in need of direction, resources, and expertise so nothing to suggest there are any issues.\n\nWe test out 2 repo softwares and then pick one. Other Engineer is responsible for setting up and configuring the production version. There are a fair number of barriers to set this up. Contact IT to get servers, Security to get firewall allowances, Security to ensure software is legit, Accounting to pay for the license, and so on. All of this is normal corporate BS.\n\nOther Engineer and I are working together every day to set this thing up. Clown is calling the shots when we have questions and helping interface with other departments. A good dynamic.\n\n(\ud834\udd60Start Montage Music\ud834\udd60)\n\n\\[Clown\\] Be sure to install the java plugin so that it can talk to the database\u2026\n\n\\[Other Engineer\\] Which version of the plugin should we use?\n\n\\[Me\\] This version is the latest stable version supported by the DB.\n\n\\[Clown\\] Yup let\u2019s use that.\n\n\\[Other Engineer and Me\\] Okay! (We happily jump back to the setup)\n\n\\[Me\\] IT is having issues getting these settings right\u2026\n\n\\[Clown\\] Sure, let me go chat with them and we can get that server up by the end of day.\n\n(\ud834\udd60End Montage Music\ud834\udd60)\n\nIt was all going well. Easy decisions and flow states all around. We would run into an issue or pushback from a department then Clown would ease things along. (I think he legit tries to be decent human he just has a bad nature but so do all well written villains)\n\n\\[Me\\] We are done. Software is in place and build artifacts are now going to the repo and being picked up by the deployment software.\n\n\\[Other Engineer\\] F\\* yeah, that took weeks, but worth it.\n\n\\[Junior Engineer\\] Excuse me guys, we have builds failing\u2026\n\nSo Other Engineer and I look over the builds and figure out that the builds are not failing, but the upload to the artifact repo is failing. You can\u2019t use the same name for a package that has a different hash.\n\n\\[Other Engineer and Me\\] Yup it\u2019s the file name. (We report this to Clown)\n\n\\[Clown\\] Aren\u2019t you familiar with Maven? Just use Maven conventions.\n\n\\[Other Engineer\\] Well we are using the naming conventions you gave us (it was not Maven convention), but as long as we are using the build number this way we will have name collisions. Those collisions break the builds and deployments.\n\n\\[Clown\\] Those will go away as soon as we have enough builds\u2026\n\n\\[Me\\] Well kind of\u2026 Every time we create a new branch the build numbers reset for that branch so \u2026 we will forever have collisions\u2026 I mean it is just how the math works\u2026\n\n\\[Other Engineer\\] We can add something like a hash to make each branch\u2019s artifact unique that would fix it.\n\n\\[Clown\\] You guys clearly don\u2019t understand how Maven works. This will sort itself out. (He dismisses us with no solution or guidance)\n\nSo we re-ran broken builds constantly for weeks hoping the situation would fix itself. I mean the math did not work (See Diagram). Other Engineer and I both came to this conclusion.\n\n\\[Junior Dev\\] We are still having collisions on a regular basis. Devs are pretty pissed their builds are taking 2-3 times longer than they used to. We have tons of tickets on this.\n\n\\[Me\\] Well the build numbers are causing a collision. We have to manually run the builds a few times until we get a unique build number.\n\n\\[Junior Engineer\\] Can\u2019t we just fix the number?\n\n\\[Me\\](realizing if it is just a parameter I can alter it) \u2026 Yes we can\u2026\n\nSo I sat down with Other Engineer and we decided to bump and stagger numbers on different build branches. Silence. No breaking builds. Everything is working now\u2026 collisions are still possible (but way less frequent). So for the next couple of weeks to solve the issue of collisions we manually bump the build number by some arbitrary magnitude. That works for our team until Clown gets a collision ticket.\n\n\\[Junior Engineer\\] Yeah, just bump the numbers up.\n\n\\[Clown\\] NO! That\u2019s not how MAVEN works!\n\n\\[Junior Engineer\\] But that\u2019s how we have been fixing it for weeks.\n\n\\[Clown\\] Who told you to do that?\n\n\\[Me\\] I did.\n\n\\[Clown\\] (To me) You don\u2019t know how Maven works.\n\n\\[Me\\] The build number does not affect the minor version. We are just skipping re-running the builds a bunch of times and advancing the number manually to avoid future collisions.\n\n\\[Clown\\] NO! That\u2019s not how this works! We will not be bumping numbers any more! You will use the build numbers and rerun the builds until it sorts itself out.\n\n\\[Me\\] Very well. For the record this will not work and we will forever have collisions if we do that. The vendor has documentation on how to deal with this issue.\n\nClown dismisses my input (really should have seen that as foreshadowing for his later jackassery). We re-run builds every now and then because the projects with a number bump would only hold so long until other builds caught up\u2026\n\nFast forward a year. A deployment failed on a high visibility new project. Our department supervisor and other Team Leads are breathing down my neck (literally at my desk behind me) as I rerun a broken build tons of times. I explain the build is fine, the code is fine, the artifact is fine, the artifact repo is working. The artifact is failing from collision issues. I calmly point them to Clown and explain his non-conventional interpretation of \u201cMaven\u201d is responsible for intermittent deployment outage and version goof ups for the last year. I show them the year\u2019s worth of tickets we did to keep it running following his solution. I show them how to easily fix it permanently. I show them the best practices docs from the vendors and explain how we are not following them. (I got my own team soon after and did not get to see that change come about.)\n\nI also ran a quick numbers calc infront of everyone to point out how much this foolishness cost us. (number of tickets \\* average time on ticket \\* cost of an engineer per hour =  $ spent on needless work) They did not like the results. I did also note that did not include delays affecting other departments.\n\nYou could have heard a pin drop in Clown\u2019s cubicle. (Please see the previous post to understand why I am keen to do damage control on him at this point.)\n\nDiagram :\n\nYes it is a hacky solution for artifact naming. No, I am not proud. I had to work with what I was given. There was a hot shower and crying sessions for sure. So much shame. These hands are so dirty\u2026.\n\nProject X\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_Main Branch\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_B1\\_\\_B2\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_B3\\_ \u2026\\_B4\n\n\\- \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \\\\ \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\\\\_\\\\\\_\\_\\_\\_Feature 2\\_\\_\/\\_\\_\\_\\_\/   \\\\\\_\\_Feature\\_3\\_\\_\/ \\*\\* \/\n\n\\-\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \\\\ \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \\\\\\_\\_Hotfix\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\/ \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \\\\\\_Feature\\_4\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\/\n\n\\-\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\\\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Feature 1\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFeature 1 builds will collide with hotfix, feature 2, 3, and 4\n\nFeature 2 and Hotfix will collide\n\nFeature 4 will collide with feature 3\n\nAll of these will collide with main branch builds\n\nMath of solution:\n\nSo if you add +100 to main you can use build numbers up to 100 on new branches then you will see collisions with Main. So a long branch like Feature 1 would get a large bump (10,000) once it hit 100 so it does not interfere with hotfixes and features or a main branch.  Feature 4 would get a bump of something like 50 to not collide with feature 3.\n\nSo Main Branch is 100 - infinity\n\nFeature 1 is 10,000 to infinity (yes it collides with Main WAY\u2026 out at 10,000+)\n\nFeature 2 and Hotfix would usually just collide build numbers are 1-100\n\nFeature 3 uses build number 1-50\n\nFeature 4 uses build number 51 -99\n\nNew major\/minor version resets the count so that is how we could reuse 1-100 on new feature branches.\n\nTL:DR\n\nWe added an artifact repository to our build system. This had a constraint of unique names for each artifact. My boss created some weird take on Maven artifact naming conventions that resulted in errors because of the aforementioned constraint. Resulting in massive slowdowns, weird workarounds. Our team came up with a permanent solution from the vendor that he refused to use. The issue festered until a large project came along where it caused an issue and he was outed as a fool.\n\nPrevious Post:\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/y7rhn8\/how\\_to\\_break\\_all\\_the\\_builds\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/y7rhn8\/how_to_break_all_the_builds\/)","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1666753446.0},{"title":"Works just well enough to be dangerous","author":"dickcheney600","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/ydavu7\/works_just_well_enough_to_be_dangerous\/","text":"I used to work for a company that built security camera systems. \nThe company in question designed and built the actual DVR\nitself, writing the software. Not sure how much of it was\nprogrammed from scratch, but our software department\nwas at least in the same building, if nothing else. I was\na lab tech with the hardware guys, assisting with any\nR&D testing as well as failure analysis, if something got\nreturned from the field. \n\nIn the hardware department we\ndid actual component-level repairs ON the circuit boards,\nso we had a microscope to give us a better chance of\ngetting surface-mount components lined up correctly.\nWe had an intermediate level of test equipment at our\ndisposal: oscilloscopes, bench power supplies and\nmultimeters, as well as simple components like resistors\nand capacitors that could be \"tacked\" across strategic\nparts of the circuit (or a protoboard) to see if it was\nan effective fix for any problems we might encounter\nwith either a prototype or a production board. \n\nThe DVR I worked on had a small NiMH backup battery, not\nenough to actually continue to record, but more so that\nif power was lost while recording, the files would\nfinish saving so that they were not corrupted. \n\nOne day, we get a returned unit where the complaint\nwas a battery-related fault code was showing up. I open\nup the box and test the battery with my multimeter.\nSure enough, it's as dead as a brick. With a bench power\nsupply that has a built-in current meter, I give the DVR\n12V to the \"main\" power input, and it boots up normally,\nand it is drawing the normal amount of current. So far so good.\n\nWe had a little adapter that allowed us to measure the\ncurrent going to and from the battery, as we were\nchecking for any parasitic current draw that might\notherwise discharge the battery (which would necessitate\nmore frequent recharging, thereby shortening it's\nservice life) as well as testing the charging circuit. So,\nI hooked up said adapter to make sure it wasn't a \nboard fault that killed the battery. I then hooked up a \nknown good battery, and rather than begin charging the\nbattery, the DVR is *drawing* about 0.25 A *from* the\nbattery while the DVR is plugged into main power.\n\nWatt?\n\nI shut down the 12V input to the DVR, and it hard-stops\nimmediately as though it lost all power. So where is that\n0.25 A going? Certainly not where it should be going. \nI look at the schematic and try to work out what might\ndraw a small current like that if it failed. Searching for \na hot component probably wouldn't work, because \n0.25 A wouldn't create a noticeable amount of heat.\nHowever, if there's an intermittent problem, pressing\non the board might yield results.\n\nOn a 12 Volt system with a relatively low current draw,\nit is pretty safe for you to touch it with your finger: Of\ncourse, you must ground yourself before doing so,\nlest you break something with static electricity. So\nI put on my anti-static wrist strap and start randomly\npressing my finger against components while watching\nthe meters and... OUCH! Well, that chip is BOILING HOT,\nso it is probably broken. Well, that wasn't too hard. Weird\nthat the current draw is almost normal, save for the \n0.25 A from the battery. So, I circle the chip on the\nschematic so that I remember which part to replace.\nI then reach over to pick up the battery and OUCH! The \nbattery is *also* BOILING HOT! ZOMGWTFBBQ\n\nImmediately I realize that any kind battery being \ntoo hot to touch is a VERY bad thing, and disconnect\nit in a hurry, then rushing to turn off everything on the\nbench. I scan the area surrounding the battery for\nany paper or other flammable materials that need to\nbe moved away from it. There weren't any, except that\nthe table was made of wood. So I grabbed a metal\nbaking pan we had nearby and put it over the battery.\nI thought of putting the battery on the pan, and\/or\ntossing it in the freezer, but I didn't think it was wise\nto move it for fear that handling it might set it off.\n\nI mentally reminded myself of where the fire extinguisher\nhad been, and, suppressing my urge to sprint, instead\nwalked over there just to make sure it was still there.\nThankfully, it was right where it belonged. I decide not\nto pick it up, lest I panic anyone when there isn't even\nany smoke coming out, much less flames. Instead I went\nback to the bench and stood several feet away, watching\nand listening for any signs of an imminent fire.\n\nAfter a few minutes the battery had cooled down. Whew!\nHowever, 0.25 A was well within the normal operating\nrange of the battery. Even if it wasn't, there's no way\non Earth anything could create that kind of heat at\nthat voltage without drawing at least 10 times that\namount of current: at least, not without actually\nusing the battery to literally ignite pyrotechnics. \nSomething just wasn't adding up here, which made\nme suspect a problem with the multimeter.\n\nSure enough, if I used the constant current mode on\nthe bench power supply (making a mental note NOT to\nexceed the maximum safe current for the amps\njacks on the multimeter) I discovered that the\n\"auto ranging\" multimeter was apparently \"stuck\"\nat the low end of the amps measurement mode.\nStrangely enough, once you exceeded 0.25A, the meter\ndid not say \"O.L.\" like it was supposed to, it would just\nstop rising, making you believe you were only drawing\n0.25 A even if you were actually drawing much more\nthan that. Yet, the fact that the current meter still changed\nwhen you connected something, would fool you into\nbelieving that the meter was still working properly.\nThe way I could tell is that the bench power supply\nhad a current meter of it's own, and I could crank\nit up to 3 amps and the meter would just sit there, still\nshowing 0.25 amps. (The meter's maximum was 10 amps,\nand it was protected by a fuse)\n\nGiven that not knowing you are overcurrenting a battery\ncould be rather dangerous, I removed the fuse for the\ncurrent measurement jack AND put a note on top\nstating that the current measurement mode did\nnot work. \n\nI later found that the battery in question had a PTC\nbuilt into it. A PTC is sort of like a circuit breaker, though\nit \"resets\" by letting it cool rather than having to \npress a reset button. It \"trips\" when it gets hot, but\nit only reduces the current rather than cutting it off.\nSo the battery just gets relatively hot, but not enough\nto be dangerous, and just dumps current into the \nfault until it runs out and dies. \n\nTL;DR: A working multimeter would have been the bomb","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1666719715.0},{"title":"A Wrench Makes A Pretty Good Hammer","author":"Newbosterone","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/ycop9z\/a_wrench_makes_a_pretty_good_hammer\/","text":"Last Friday at 4 PM ~~I foolishly answered the phone~~ got a call from the director of a group I support.  \n\n\u201cNewb - we\u2019ve just found out we need to do a data push Sunday night.

I was an intern with their Network Support team. This was not an IP network team like you might be thinking, but rather a PoTS network team. We were supporting analog phone lines going between various sites; office buildings, power plants, etc. So pictures a bunch of guys who have been dealing with the same kind of equipment for \\~25 years each. Very knowledgeable about what they knew, but not so much on newer stuff.\n\nThey had a bunch of techs going out to all of these sites, making updates to wiring or equipment, and coming back to our dispatch center. Now having all of these techs doing jobs like this, you'd imagine that there should be some kind of logging mechanism for all of the jobs being done, so that when something went wrong at Site A, you could look at everything that's been done there in the past 6 months, and look at where all the cables are connected to. You'd be right. In our case, the \"single source of truth\" for this information was an excel workbook on a networked storage drive that all of the techs had access to. Mind you, this was not a well-structured workbook with sheets per-location and tables of jobs done. This was essentially a freeform document with a single sheet, thousands of rows, and structure per-site or no structure at all in some cases. It was essentially a word document that just so happened to be addressable with row and column numbers (in some cases). Now even \\_if\\_ this were a well-structured document, using an excel doc on a NAS is a really bad collaboration tool. At the time (I'm not sure if this is true today), excel used lockfiles to ensure that only one person could update a workbook at a time. This meant that when you opened the workbook while someone else had it open on their own machine, you'd get a prompt that told you you had to open it in read-only mode, or you could save a separate copy. Many times techs chose to save a separate copy, meaning that there would often be many copies of this file that would later need to be merged. Since this document had essentially no structure, it was impossible to programmatically diff two versions of it, so all merging needed to be done by hand. I tried to convince management that we needed some kind of job management\/log software instead of this terrible system, but they were unmoved. I was told the existing system was good enough and to just deal with it. Besides, I was just an intern fresh out of HS.

NEVER DO FREE TECH SUPPORT.\n\nWell guys, I took things a step further. I recently finished a CompSci degree and with opportunities few and far between in my country, I was itching for a real-world project I could sink my teeth into from start to finish, for the experience ya know.\n\nOne day, I was chatting with my friend who had just quit her private school teaching job due to burnout and was tutoring students in private classes as a means of income. This particular day she was describing how stressed she was trying to figure out what each parent owed her for the classes (she bills at the start of every quarter). I asked about her process and she showed me an incredibly convoluted spreadsheet (with no formulae) and was doing manual calculations on everything, then contacting each parent with a generic \"you owe me x total\" either by email or text message.\n\nHa! I found my project. I didn't tell her this, but I started working on something quietly. I had a copy of her spreadsheet and in a few months of nights and weekends, much head-bashing, several screwups, and a few tears,  I had a working prototype. At this point I let her know. She was thrilled. Thanked me profusely and promptly left the country she lived in for a couple of months. At this point, I must note that we live on opposite sides of the planet with a 12hr time difference between us. During this time she was online like normal and I asked her to let me know when she was ready to install the application so we could do some testing *before* it was time to use it for real. No dice.\n\nI didn't want to be pushy because what if she didn't actually want this? It's not like I told her I was doing it ahead of time or anything (mainly because I wasn't sure if I could actually produce something good enough). Anyway, two months roll by and she is back in the country that she lives in and is ready and excited about installation. Great. Through much teeth gnashing, we get it installed and she starts using it. I fully expect bugs because while I did extended testing myself, I'm not the user and we all know how that goes! So I ask her to note bugs found in a shared document. By this time, her classes are starting and she is using it with live data and not using any backup note-taking. I try to tell her, \"hey we haven't tested this fully yet, maybe do both for a bit\" but of course, it's too much work. You know what else is too much work, using the very short manual I typed out telling her how each part of the program works.\n\nMuch to my surprise, there are very few bugs. But I look at the document she is compiling and guys there are THIRTY-EIGHT \"Hey maybe you can do this extremely complicated thing to the program so I can only click one button instead of two\".  At first, I considered this good feedback. I mean, if I'm to deal with real-world users, this is *precisely* how they will behave right? I go through the app and fix\/change 18 of the 38 things she wanted done. Some I decided were too complicated to accomplish with very little reward, others couldn't really be done because I hemmed myself in with my DB design (learning my lessons!), and some I just found annoying so I defiantly and tactfully said \"no\".\n\nTwo weeks later, I send her version 1.1.  Immediately she complains that the discount field is a percentage value and not a dollar amount. I snarkily comment at any dollar amount is a percentage of a whole. She responds \"I don't know what percentage $100 is of a $900 bill. Well, I guess I could use a calculator. \" (Note: I may actually change the discount field to a dollar amount but I was tired of her entitlement for all the other stuff she requested hence the snark).\n\nToday I woke up to a new note: \"You know what I really hate, having to email out these invoices. Maybe you could make the app do it automatically.\" **Edit to add**: How could I forget that she wanted the email feature done \"in the next couple of days\" so that she could send out invoices before her students start!\n\nGuys, this lady had been manually tracking students, parents, dates, times, contact info, discounts, class attendance, and then sitting with a calculator doing manual calculations etc. I gave her an application that automatically generates nicely designed PDF invoices by the parent based on enrollment of multiple children, keeps track of attendance and payments, maps parents to students, and generates charts, lists, and reports based on provided criteria for both finance (outstanding invoices, income reports for taxes, etc) and enrollment, but how dare I make her manually send out her 10-15 invoices every quarter!\n\nThis was supposed to be a hobby project that I'd work on for a bit, sharpen some skills then move on to working on skills in other areas. I haven't been able to move on from it yet a whole year later because I was dumb and did it for free.\n\nEntirely my fault and I own it. Head, meet desk. Repeatedly.\n\nP.S. I know that such programs already exist and she could easily have found a paid solution online. The goal of the exercise was to see if I could create one from start to finish.

This lady was my 2nd call ever, and it appeared an easy ticket as she just needed her password reset... little did I know.\n\nSo I pull up Office admin page to change password and select change password on next login. I call the client to tell her I reset the password and that she can go ahead and try to login now with the new password and reset it on login. When she puts in the new password she gets a failed to authenticate user error. I become a little flustered as this is supposed to be my easiest task and I screwed up out of the gate. \n\nSo I look over in a slight panic at my team member who has been training me and he fills me in that since they are on a MacBook I am unable to use the change password on first login with office. I try to explain this as I am having it explained to me and she is not having any of it. \"What do you mean, I have used apple for over 10 years and always been able to reset my password.\" Continue to try and explain to her that it isn't a big deal she just needs to tell me what she wants her password to be... Silence... \n\n\"I AM NOT DOING THAT\" \n\nReset her password without the change at login selectef to just a temp password so she can login to her email on her MacBook. But she attempts to login to her email on her phone and now she can't get into her work email on her phone. She can login through the browser on her phone but not her native iphone email app. And she is pissed that she can't set her own password and does not accept that the apple os is having issues (maybe our Tier 3 is wrong but he took the time to give me a satisfactory answer, she just didn't accept it, my doubts lie with her not his explanation) and thinks they as the user should have admin privileges to do password resets and none of this would be an issue.\n\nI tell her I will have to consult with some of my colleagues and will call her back when we have a resolution. I consult with our tier 3 at this point explaining that she won't say the password she wants set so he advises to do a remote connection and login to the admin page on a private browser through her machine and have her enter the password so it is never in plaintext since that seems to be her concern, and tell her to try using the outlook app for mail on her phone. He didn't really have time to elaborate on the phone but didn't think he needed to as Outlook app was the easy answer. \n\nCall the client back to make her aware of what we think will help. She tells me very firmly, she is using the outlook app, and that she even wiped the cache to clear user info and still couldn't login. I try to confirm that she is using Outlook app from the iPhone app store. She says yes she keeps selecting outlook.com at the login page. My team member was monitoring the call at this point and looks at me wildly shaking his head NO. I am not familiar with iPhone, not really my job to be as we don't offer support to mobile devices but we have to make a \"best effort\" to resolve the issue for the client. So he explains that she is using the native Mail app for iPhone and she needs to download Outlook for security reasons when accessing her work outlook account. \n\nI try explaining to no avail and at this point she is just downright belligerent because I have admitted I am not an iPhone user and we don't have a way to remote to her phone so I can offer better support. I pass her off to my team member because he explains to her he uses an iPhone and he was able to login to her email through his phone on the outlook app but not the native mail app and that it seems like her only solution is to use outlook app. She tells him we need to figure this out and it is unacceptable and it's clearly a Microsoft issue (we are not microsoft) so figure it out. He repeats the issue is the iPhone app not the outlook app and she can take the fix or not but we have provided support to the best of our ability and we will be closing this ticket.\n\n\nThat was exhausting to retype\/live so if you read all of that please tell me they won't all be like that because even my team member wanted to kick this lady off a bridge to a shallow creek\ud83d\ude02","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1665723738.0},{"title":"I'm just tech illiterate","author":"absinthangler","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/y334n7\/im_just_tech_illiterate\/","text":"Hello there, per usual I come to vent some rage and bring you along with me for the ride in a conversation heavy support call that should have taken 3 minutes or less. \n\n**Ring Ring.** \n\n\"Hell Desk, this is Absinthe speaking.\"\n\n\"Hi Absinthe, this is User, and I can't get the texts on my phone when I try to log into the VPN.\" \n\n\"Thats easy enough to fix.

One of the top universities in fact.

This was back in the days when the computer company that had cow looking boxes was still in business and network storage had yet to be implemented. One of the features of these computers was that you were given the option on startup to return the computer to the factory state by pressing the F11 key. That accursed F11 key. On with the story.\n\nThe players: Me, self explanatory; Prof, panicked professor; Student, minor player.\n\nI had just arrived in the office at 8:00 AM and my phone was already ringing. \n\nMe; \"Good morning, this is Crash\\_n\\_Burn365, how my I help you?\"\n\nProf: \"I have a class at 9:00 and I can't find the files I need!\"\n\nMe: \"Okay, are they not in your Documents directory?\"\n\nProf: \"I can't get into my documents directory!\"\n\nMe: \"Your documents directory is missing?\"\n\nProf: \"No! I can't log into my computer!\"\n\nI can hear the voices in my head beginning to murmur. How does not being able to log in translate into \"I can't find the files I need\"?\n\nMe: \"Okay, what does the screen say?\"\n\nProf: \"It says blah blah blah.\" (I really don't remember the exact error.)\n\nI sigh as I recognize the computer is in the middle of a factory reset.\n\nMe: \"You pressed F11 didn't you?\"\n\nProf: \"Yes.\"\n\nMe: \"Why?\"\n\nProf: \"Because it told me to when I restarted the computer.\"\n\nNever mind that she had been seeing the same message every time she started the computer for the past year, \"Press F11 for Recovery\". This time she decided to follow the instructions on screen, including the three following screens informing her that the computer would be reset to factory defaults and all data would be lost and asking \"are you sure?\" Are you sure? Yeah, why not, what could possibly go wrong!?\n\nMe, quieting the voices in my head: \"I'll be in your office in a few minutes to take a look.\" knowing there is nothing I can do to recover any files.\n\nI tell her what I already knew, the computer has been wiped and restored to factory specs. There is no possibility of recovering any of her files.\n\nProf: \"So you can't get ANY of my files back?\"\n\nMe: \"No, you pressed F11 and restored the computer to how it was when it came out of the factory.\" \n\nProf: \"Do you think it might have been a virus?\"\n\nMe, the voices in my head crying: \"No, you pressed F11.\"\n\n Later that morning I'm in her office installing programs she will need, mainly Office and a couple of others when she comes in with a student in tow.\n\nStudent: \"Oh, are you having computer problems?\"\n\nProf: \"Yes, we think it is a virus.\"\n\nI sigh as the voices in my head start babbling among themselves.

I was in discord when my co-healer dropped in the middle of our 07s reclear. It killed the run and we started to chat as they were unable to connect to discord on either their phone or their PC. \n\nMy mind went to router issues. Could be cache memory or even a dns failure. Either way solution is the same, restart router. \n\nI get her to put her phone on 4G. Discord connects immediately. \n\n> $Me - Hey you should just go ahead and power cycle your router. The fact that you were able to connect on 4g and it refused to connect on wifi means its probably a router error. Could be modem, but probably router. Most likely a cache issue or dns issue. \n\n> $Her - How does that happen. \n\nI started to explain it in a way that is mostly wrong, but is very easy to understand to the laymen. Everyone reading this. I KNOW it doesn't actually work like this. I just explain it this way so people can get an idea of what is happening. \n\n> $Me - You want the simple or the technical explanation?\n\n> $Her - Technical. \n\n> $Me - You know how when you come home your phone auto connects to the wifi? \n\n> $Her - Yeah. \n\n> $Me - Well thats because your router and phone remember each other. \n\nAgain. I KNOW THIS IS WRONG. This is my laymen explanation as it makes people more readily accept that the issue is a network issue and not a *our company* issue for work calls... even though this was not a work call.  \n\n> $Me - The router is supposed to clear out that memory after a while but sometimes it does not do that. So you get errors like this where some websites work, and others just stop working. Its a very frustrating issue, but it is easy enough to fix. Just restart your router. \n\n> $Her - OK ill tell my husband to restart the router. \n\nTwo minutes later. \n\n> $Her - So he is saying it cant be the router as nothing changed on the configuration and that the dns has not changed.  \n\n> $Me - Is he a network admin?\n\n> $Her - How did you know?\n\n> $Me - Lucky guess... Just go power cycle it. Trust me, this will probably fix the issue.   \n\n> $Her - OK. \n\nShe goes and does it without asking him and he apparently starts to throw a fit over this as he was interrupted watching the blacklist on netflix. (I mean... its a good show so I kinda understand.)\n\n> $Her - Yup that fixed it. Im back on on my PC and my phone is connecting to it on wifi.   \n\n> $Me - Yup. DNS errors and cache problems are the bane of my existence.   \n\n> $Her husband - Are you the so called Tech who told her some bullshit about DNS erros?  \n\n> $Me - *Suppressing a laugh.* Yup. Looks like the router was having a cache problem or dns errors. Restarting appears to have fixed it though. \n\n> $Husband - The dns configuration has not changed. The router is designed to flush its resolver cache once it gets full. Everything you said was wrong on all levels. YOu know this right?  \n\n> $Me - Firstly... no device is able to flush its cache memory 100 percent of the time. Second. I told her my laymen explanation as it lets people kinda sorta know what is wrong. \n\n> $Husband - Yeah well you need a better explanation. Ive been doing this since you were in diapers. \n\nHe mentioned 2 names which I will shorten here. \n\n> $Husband - I started in the 80s with B B and R McC. Do you know who they are?  \n\n> $Me - Should I?  \n\n> $Husband - They invented Apache. You can't BS with me son. I know how things work and I know what causes issues like that. \n\n> $Me - OK. Well it looks like restarting the router did fix it so I am happy to have helped. \n\nHe was speechless and walked away. She gets back on the mic laughing. \n\n> $Her - You know you are like the 3rd tech to have like that exact conversation with him right? \n\n> $Me - Yeah.

But it's dead. \n\nI try the next socket, it's dead.\n\nOK... \n\nEach of the sockets on this pillar is individually fused with a 2A fuse. This is because of the fact it's sharing a 13A socket. However, most of the machines on this island don't draw anywhere near that sort of current, so this is never an issue.\n\nHowever, as i go along with my box full of fuses, it turns out 11 out of 12 are fairly well popped.\n\nI go up to one of the site team, bearing a fair handful of fuses (including some that didn't come out without a fight), and i say to them...\n\n>Why are all these fuses blown?!

The old PC evidently has some hardware faults, because it keeps locking up solid, (frozen mouse and buzzing audio) with no useful information in Event Viewer. I installed the new one on a Saturday, moved as much of the existing workflow on it, but a few tools aren't able to be moved. I stuck the old PC in the corner with a small monitor, and told them to replace the old software ASAP so they can retire the flaky PC. Everything that I moved over, worked perfectly -- or so I thought.\n\nThe following Monday, I get a text from the other accountant, complaining of no network access on her machine -- *and* the machine I just installed. Then I get a phone call from a secretary helping out the accountant. Shit. Thus begins an hour of telephone-induced frustration.\n\nWe went around in circles for most of the call. I had them try `ipconfig \/renew` a few times (or as they wanted to type it, `ip config\/renew`). They also managed to read all of the useless stuff from ipconfig's output, without telling me anything that actually mattered, like the IPv4 address. Eventually I did determine that nothing was able to pull DHCP leases. Tracing the cables wasn't any easier, as I misremembered which color cables I had previously installed, and the users had to move a big desk to find the plate in the wall. *Finally*, we got down to some troubleshooting:\n\n* The second accountant's computer, when directly plugged into the wall, could access the network.\n* When using the switch as a coupler, it still works. This means I have yet to actually see a switch go bad.\n* When adding the new PC I installed on Saturday, it still works.\n* When readding the old, crashing PC, the connection drops for the other two -- *wait, what?*\n   * Unplugging it makes the network work again??? Huh?\n\nI had them turn on the monitor for the old PC. Lo and behold, it was frozen. Nobody could hear the buzzing audio because I had plugged the speakers into the new PC.

Among our clients you would find most international newspapers, all of the international news agencies, publishing houses and so on and so forth.*\n\n*End users didn't have our contact details, as they were served by local resellers who served as both salespeople and integrators. As a result, we were essentially tier two and three support. I had direct access to all of our development team, and worked closely with them on bug fix and testing. But I digress.*\n\nI'd been working a particularly challenging ticket for a few weeks. The customer would be having intermittent issues accessing our software. We turned on increasing levels of logging, but found nothing that even came close to indicating what the issue was. I'd been talking to the lead developer for this product on a daily basis, and we just couldn't get to grips with it.\n\nHe created a new build of the core software, which would log everything. Anything that happens on the server is logged, no matter how big or small. This has two side effects: Server utilization is about doubled, and the log files grow big very, very quickly. He'd run it on his test server, and got gigabytes' worth of log files (raw text) within hours.\n\nThe client, located in New York, declared a service window between 1100 and 2000 on a friday - local time, meaning 1800 my time - well after my normal working hours. But hey, I got double OT and overtime food, so I was relatively happy.\n\nAt any rate, we install the new build, and wait for the log files to start building. The log files generally looked fine, until I finally found a line stating:\n\n>Error: Unable to access server Boonies725\n\nI'm in hour three of a conference call with the customer. They are stressed out, I am worn out, and well, we're all tired. I point this out to them as follows:\n\n>Me: What's that server? I haven't seen that referred to before?  \n>  \n>Customer: Oh, that one? It doesn't exist anymore. Sandy killed it.  \n>  \n>Me: Sandy? As in hurricane Sandy?  \n>  \n>Customer: Yup. That entire data center died when it flooded. If memory serves, that particular server was at the bottom of the rack, and actually drowned.  \n>  \n>Me: Well... The system seems to be trying to access it. Let's have another look at the configuration, why don't we?\n\nSure enough, five to ten minutes later, we find that Boonies725 was still set up as a backup\/overflow server when their main server was overloaded. Once we removed that, their problems were resolved.\n\nAs for the log files, the new build was only installed for about three and a half hours, so it only took up about a hundred gigabytes. They were **HEAVY** users of our software, to say the least...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAuthor's note: I should add that the configuration they were using was one which was technically usable, but neither the intended use case for the feature they were using, nor one which was officially supported or documented. The failover feature was entirely rewritten in a later major release, to prevent this from happening again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Customer uses software in a way it wasn't intended to be used. When a server farm is killed by Hurricane Sandy, they don't reconfigure the software, and the vendor provides a separate \"log all\" build to identify the issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Find all my Tales from Tech Support here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/search\/?q=author%3Arazumny&restrict_sr=1&sr_nsfw=)","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1665409556.0},{"title":"Why is no one helping me, but I won't answer when IT emails me?","author":"Another_Basic_NPC","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/xz1uvm\/why_is_no_one_helping_me_but_i_wont_answer_when\/","text":"I used to work in a tier one role, so boots on the ground, and recently got into a tier 2 role (yay!) so I figured I'd start sharing some stories with the nice people I worked with lol.\n\nI worked at an office with anywhere from a co-op to a partner or more, so we had some higher ups always kicking around. One partner however, was always a complete wet blanket anytime you tried to work with him. There was always the two types, the ones that would chat you up a bit while you helped, and then ones demanding it fixed and say nothing. He was the latter sadly. One day, he reached out saying he wanted a headset setup and delivered to him to my boss, so naturally it comes to me. As he was always in calls, and I also love having an email as a backup, I emailed him that morning. I advised him I had a headset ready, and if he could pop over when he was free, I would be happy to help with it. No response.\n\nDay two, same thing, emailed the same text and got no reply. On day three however, he got mad, and called my manager demanding to know why no one helped. And finally, he came over to see me, freaking out about a headset, and that IT wasn't even trying to help him. I told him I've tried contacting him multiple times, and every time I walk by the office he's in, he's in a call with the door shut. Right away he demands to see where I contacted him, so we pull up the emails, the date\/time, and I show both attempts with no answer, which was priceless. Sure enough, we made a time, took the two minutes to plug it in and test it, and I went on my way. No apologies or anything naturally, but he never tried that again when I emailed him in the future.

Technically I'm tier 2. While I don't do password resets or the like, I do set people up in their systems for the first time. We call these \"New Hire Classes\". These are all done remotely and usually done with five new hires at a time. We block off two hours for a new hire class but it seldomly takes more than 75 minutes (assuming 5 new hires). At the end of the session, I always ask if they need any help. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. Every once in a great while, someone gets a printer, and they need help setting them up; usually this means installing drivers and making the printer the default printer for their system. 25 minutes, tops. \n\nAt the beginning of July, I did a one-on-one set up with a user. Went pretty smoothly and at the end, I asked him if he needed help. He stated he had a printer that he needed set up but that he didn't have the time to set it up right then. I said no worries; I can reach out the next day to talk him through it. We set up a time and sign off. \n\nThe next day rolls around, and I reach out to the user on Teams (how we do 95% of our communicating) at the appointed time. Radio silence. I can see he's on and active, but he didn't respond. Oh well, he's probably busy. No worries. \n\nLater in the day, I try reaching out to him again. Met with nothing. I do the same the next day and the day after. He doesn't respond. I know he's working because one of my fellow techs got a ticket for him for audio issues with Teams. But he doesn't respond.\n\nA week later, I reach out and he finally responds. He's having trouble putting the cartridges in the printer. Mind you, the printer is an HP Officejet; it's pretty straightforward. I talk him through it, and he still doesn't get it. So, I find a video that shows how to install the cartridges and I send it to him. And then nothing. \n\nI continue hearing nothing for another two weeks. Finally, I sent an email to him, and I CC'd his manager, my manager and my supervisor stating that if I didn't hear from him by COB, I'd be resolving the ticket and he'd need to open a new one when he had the time to complete the setup. We usually do this after 3 contact attempts, but I was determined; usually the user's manager leans on them to respond but as fate would have it, they were two of a kind. I closed the ticket and promptly forgot about it.\n\nFast forward to Thursday morning and this guy reaches out and asks if I could set up his printer for him. I had to actually open our previous conversation to see who he was. I said no, I couldn't without a ticket and that he'd need to call our tier 1 helpdesk to open a ticket. He says okay. 20 minutes later, he's back and tell me he has a ticket, and he wants me to set up his printer. I told him that the tech who was assigned the ticket would reach out to him. He actually got a bit upset when I couldn't drop everything to set up his printer...3 months after I originally attempted to. I was up to my ears in resolving a VPN issue and wasn't about to humor him. I told him he'd have to wait until the ticket got assigned. I found later out that his ticket didn't get assigned until late in the day.\n\nFriday morning, my manager sends me an IM asking if I had refused to help a user set up his printer as the user complained to his manager that he had already had a ticket for setting up his printer. User's manager complained to the manager in charge of the IT Liaison between my company and our contractor, who complained to my manager. \n\nI walked my manager through the timeline, and he actually dug up the CC'd email, which he promptly backed me up and fired it off to the user's manager. I learned later that an apology was issued to my manager (but not to me). My fellow tech had the pleasure of helping this guy set up his printer (and finding out that he needed a USB printer cable, which the user kept calling an \"HMDI\" cable).","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1665278501.0},{"title":"\"Security has not approved rsync.\"","author":"OvidPerl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/xxvesh\/security_has_not_approved_rsync\/","text":"Not me, but a friend.\n\nThey were working as a sysadmin and the company needed a tool to synchronize files across servers.

I grabbed my co-workers tupperware container from his desk, and like lemmings they followed me to the kitchen. Gently I placed the board in the container, then filled it a third of the way with isopropyl alcohol. On the lid I placed a sticky note that read \"shake me, please\" and gave it a little shake myself. I then let it sit on the counter for the remainder of the week, shaking it myself every time I went in there and seeing others do the same.

Press shift and itacts like the four key is being held down with the shift pressed. So, unplug both keyboards, no change. Press four key to see if it is stuck, 4 key works fine. Restart the computer, its fine for a couple, then starts spamming 4 again. Turn of computer and unplug for a bit, replug and turn on, fine for a couple but then more 4s. Unplug both keyboards and restart computer, more fours. Start in safe mode, no fours, but accidently did it without having internet connection so have to restart again to restart in safe mode. It was after this restart nto normal mode, that I made an observation. The 4s started immediatly after the razor program loaded on his computer. Ask my roomate what razer devices he has attached to his computer. Turns out, my roomate has a THIRD keyboard that is razer brand, and under some stuff, while plugged in. Found the culprit.

Eventually, I would be hired full-time because I was the only one who knew different systems (a story for another time).\n\nThe local site did not like being owned, they had a very local first mindset. They wanted to keep all their local departments and not use corporate for anything if they could help it.\u00a0\n\nOur story starts with the head of the local IT department leaving because he did not like being a little fish in a big pond. I was hired as site lead for the corporate service desk (again long story).\n\nFor some reason, I never figured out finance was over IT in the old org structure and even though I technically worked for corporate they still felt they were in control and would make stupid choices and tried to control IT as they did before.\n\nCorporate shut down one of their sites in England and wanted to move one of the product lines to our location, this was a big deal and required a lot of work because the line needed a higher class of stale room than we had. Needless to say, it was a shit show from beginning to end.\u00a0\n\nWhen it came to anything tech rated to the room we were the last to know and yelled at because it was not done already.\n\nThey wanted an extra access point out in the ceiling, ok just let us know where and when. But by the time they said they wanted it installed there were machines directly under where it needed to go. The room was empty for months but they did not decide where it needs to go until after it was full.\n\nThis all came to a head when the head of finance decided they wanted fancy touch screen surface pro 4 tablets in the room so you did not need a keyboard or mouse. They used the computer to access ordered and record parts produced.\u00a0\n\nAs site lead I was responsible for asset management meaning I kept track of IT equipment and who they were assigned. I had to follow all the guidelines for what could be ordered and what was and was not allowed. I think you may see where I am going.\n\nThe finance department did not order the surface laptops through me from corporate like they would for all other IT equipment. Instead, they decided they were going to just create their purchase order and then send the costs of it over to IT.\n\nThey bought four brand new surface pro 4 tablets. Next was my task to get them on the network and installed. I worked with facilities to get an acrylic mount put in so people could not walk off with them.\n\nAfter about a week people complained about using a touch screen and wanted a keyboard and mouse installed defeating the purpose of the surface but finance agreed with them and ordered Bluetooth keyboards with a trackpad.\u00a0\n\nNow, remember these rooms are under a high level of sterilization. This means hair nets, lab coats, gloves, and shoe covers. The trackpad on the keyboard did not like the gloves and was a pain to use. Because production rant nearly 24\/7 the battery on the wireless keyboard would not last as long and needed to be recharged a lot.\n\nSo after months of other issues, we ended up with having the wireless keyboard always plugged in and a wired mouse added. They were finally happy with them, then crap hit the fan.\n\nThe service desk was working on new asset management systems including a new database of all equipment at each site. I had my local spreadsheets of this info so it was easy to enter that into the system. About an hour after I finished updating our site with the new system I get a call from the head of asset management.\n\nAM Head:\n\"Why do you have four surface pro laptops at your site, they are not allowed\"\n\nOP:\n\"Yeah they ordered them and made me install them, I tried to object but was overruled\"\n\nAM Head:\n\n\"You're the site lead, when it comes to IT matters they can't overrule you\"\n\nOP:\n\n\"Try telling that to the head of finance, they wanted them and so created a PO and bought them.\"\n\nAM Head:\n\"Are they joined to the domain?\"\n\nOP:\n\"Yeah, they have been for a few months now, why?\"\n\nAM Head:\n\"Get them off the network ASAP, those laptops don't have TPM chips they can't be encrypted so all that company data on them can't be protected\"\n\nOP:\n\"I see, if I go and take them out they might lynch me what should I do?\"\n\nAM head:\u00a0\n\"Well if they want to go over your head then we can go over theirs, once I give you the go-ahead remove them from the domain and wipe them completely. They are never to be used for corporate use ever again\"\n\nOP: \n\"What should I do with them?\"\n\nAM head:\n\"Take one home with you and give the others always as long as people know they can't be used for anything company-related period\"\n\nOP smiling:\n\"With pleasure\"\n\nThe IT department is just an alley of cubicles near finance and HR. We heard yelling coming from the finance manager's office. He then left his office and went into the office of all the CEO of the local site and more yelling followed.\u00a0\n\nAfter that, the finance director came to me and said that they needed to be removed and replaced without a standard kiosk station. He then said the surface computers were to be turned over to him.\n\nI informed him that I was under orders from the service desk to dispose of them. I could see he wanted to yell at me but he held his tongue.\u00a0\n\nThat's how me and some of my friends at that place got nice free surface pro 4 laptops for free.\n\nThey had to eat the cost because the service desk rejected their PO. After all, it was not approved before they ordered them.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1664845815.0},{"title":"Dusty keyboard?

This is my sh!t, and I'm glad to help out my friends and fellow students.\n\nThe biggest problem we've got is we're holding it at a different location and we can only get in there two hours before the house opens, so we'll hold a tech rehearsal in a place where we can reasonably simulate the projection software. Great. No problems from here, right?\n\nWrong. First of all, everything's in the wrong video codec. $AOSP only takes a specific family of codecs, and because the editors were all using Windows, there go our plans to have one copy of the files. This doesn't happen until the night before, so I get the media morning of the show.\n\nBased on the sudden realization that they need projection and the lack of information about the show, I end up programming 404 (heh) cues over 4 days. No clue what I was doing and nobody on the crew even knew what the program does.\n\nSo anyways, we get to the show, and we start running it. Everything's looking great, we re-calibrated the projector, re-focused lights (which was an adventure) and I'm ready to go.\n\nWe get going, and then things start going wrong. I've been editing a couple cues to make sure that the video loops (spoiler alert: things still didn't loop due to miscommunications on the cue sheet I got), and then the computer crashes. No problem, just restart. Well, there's no projector remote, so we get a nice blue wash on the stage in the meantime. Fun.\n\nThen the lights start flickering. The dimmer boxes are ceiling mounted near the electrics and there's not even a hint of a catwalk. Half the sliders\/faders\/pots (whatever your local dialect of board op is) don't do anything, and all of the little things that go over them to make them something other than little pieces of metal that fingers *love* to dig into are gone. We're screwed. But the show must go on, so I just cross my fingers and pray that we don't go dark on stage without warning or control from me (spoiler alert: we do. Twice. Luckily the projector was still on so there was some light.).\n\nThe picture comes up on the projector, and I get the show up and running again. The stage manager comes up to me and I fill her in on the situation and say we may need to call an intermission to reboot. I get the go-ahead, and clear it with the sound board op to make sure there's a microphone for it to be called. The stage manager then tells me that we're cutting a couple cues. Great. More rebooting.\n\nUltimately, we got through the show. Not everything looped, some things played over other things, lights died a couple times, and the sound board op pretty much fell asleep during some projection cues that had built-in audio and during the strike at the end of the show, unplugged the computer without warning.

They've bought a gaming PC from \"the Internet\" to play recent games, the senior's son bought it for his own son, for his birthday, and it's variously incapable or absolute dogshit. It keeps crashing, throws up weird errors, and is generally not a very nice machine.\n\nCould I see what's wrong with it, and tell them how much it would be to put right? They don't have a lot of money, and the kid's really disappointed that his birthday present is not working very well.\n\nThe spec as sold:\n\n\"iGamer Desktop Tower Gaming PC\"\n\nIntel Core i7 7700\n\n8 GB DDR4-2400\n\n240 GB SSD + 2 TB 7,200 RPM HDD\n\nNvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB\n\n1000 Watt PSU 80Plus Titanium\n\nThe plasticky, tower case is duly heaved from the back of a car and handed over, together with a password to get into it.\n\nI'm carrying it in and noticed the top mounted USB ports aren't aligned quite right, and one of them is wedged under the bezel. I remember thinking \"Is this a wish dot com gaming machine?!\"\n\nIt gets hooked up to my 27\" IPS panel and turned on. The buzzing of a cable rubbing a fan greeted my ears, as I pulled power.\n\n\"Guess I'm opening it before checking it running,\" I thought. This was to prove a good idea.\n\nYou know how, over time, drive swaps, fan replacements or realignments, the best made cable management becomes a bit sloppy?\n\nImagine every component installed with that mindset. A single fan cable was cable-tied to a retaining slot on the case, but three others hung loose nearby. The two SATA cables (NVMe? What's that?) looped into the front fans, and one had worn through the red outer sheath. Not good.\n\nI give it a more thorough inspection. The heatsink is a round radial thing with an embedded fan, and a mounting adapter to make the push-clip fit. I'm familiar with these, they're cheap, widespread, have a hundred different names, and they're awful. They're good to around 40-50 watts TDP. The i7 7700 is specified to 65 watts by Intel, and 100 watts by everyone else. I left it as it was: While terrible, it won't harm anything other than TurboBoost.\n\nA single 8 GB DDR4 DIMM gazed up at me. Single channel mode is, again, not ideal, but not a deal breaker.\n\nThe GPU was the first sign of madness. It was emphatically, convincingly, *excruciatingly* not a GTX 1060. I reached into the spares pile and retrieved a GT 430. You may also know this as GT 440, GT 520, GT 530, GT 620, and GT 730. Same GF108 GPU, usually DDR3 memory, sometimes GDDR5. They all used the same PCB design, and the PCB matched exactly.\n\nThey'd put some effort into the fraudulent GPU: Any idiot could look through the side panel and see the tiny little single 40 mm fan embedded in a tiny heatsink and say \"That is not a GTX 1060\". This one had a big plastic shroud with some turbine-like designs on it, looking to a distant eye a bit like a pair of fans.\n\nI check it's not about to do something dangerous to itself or others and fire it up.\n\nDevice manager shows a GTX 1060. GPU-Z shows a GTX 1060\\[FAKE\\] and confirmed my GF108 suspicions. That'll be why games don't work.\n\nCPU-Z shows the next part of this wacky story. The motherboard isn't identified but by chipset, but the CPU is showing as a Core i7-7700HQ.\n\nThe base 7700 is a desktop chip, runs at 3.6 GHz base, and max Turbo to 4.2. It's best known for being squashed by Ryzen, which is about all you needed to know about the Kaby Lake generation.\n\nThe 7700HQ is a 2.8 GHz base and turbos up to 3.8 GHz. Same 4c\/8t configuration, 2 MB less L2 cache, and a TDP of 45 watts, which could be configured as low as 35 watts using \"TDP-down\". This essentially hobbled TurboBoost.\n\nTher 7700HQ is also a *mobile* CPU. What the hell is it doing here, in a desktop, on what looks like a desktop board?!\n\nI run Cinebench R20. Temperature gets to around 80C, nothing scary. The result is not great, but not awful. I remember it running about the same as a Skylake i5 I'd worked on around a year before.\n\nI reboot into BIOS. \"TDP-Down\" is indeed set to \"35W\" (the other option was \"Disabled\") and the menus are very bare, without any information as to who, or what, made this motherboard.\n\nPick your favourite religious evil-doer. He or she made it.\n\nI power off and pop the heatsink. Why is there a BGA CPU, on a PCB, in the LGA1151? True enough, it was a valid i7-7700HQ. That'll be why the terrible heatsink is enough.\n\nYou can sometimes find these on eBay, they're recycled laptop chips put on LGA adapters. For cheap CPUs, they're actually quite hard to beat.\n\nI replace the GPU with a GTX 680\/2GB I've got going spare. The least I could do is get some games working for 'em.\n\nI replace the CPU heatsink with an Intel stock cooler, and disable the TDP-Down options. As I'm doing so, I check out the RAM.\n\nSPD shows DDR4-2133, and SPD is set \"Auto\". Wait... I saw DDR4-2400 during POST display. Hang on, what's this option \"RAM Speed Report\" and the free-number field set to 2400? Is it... no... that's just... I key in \"1234\", save and exit.\n\nPOST shows me 8 GB DDR4 1234. Fuck.\n\nI pull two matched 8 GB DDR4-2400, install them, and disable \"RAM Speed Report\". What ELSE could go wrong with this thing? Surely I've covered pretty much all the bases here, right?\n\nOh hell no.\n\nRemember that 240 GB SSD? 190 GB. No, not a partitioning thing, actually 190 GB. The 2 TB HDD actually did seem to be 2 TB, a Hitachi 5,940 RPM DeskStar 5K2000 mechanism. Yes, they did stop making those in around 2015, why do you ask?\n\nThe PSU was hooked up to my tester, which monitors voltages and provides a resistive dummy load up to 1.1 KW. The PSU itself was far, far FAR too light for a kilowatt supply. Remember those achingly shite things which used to be bundled with cases, usually optimistically rated to 300 watts? One of those.\n\nThe tester, something I'm somewhat proud of, is a bank of big power resistors, two glued-in digital multimeters, and an Arduino, nothing special to the point of a real PSU tester, though. It puts 50 watts on the 5V rail, 10 watts on the 3.3 V rail, and can pull around 90 amps from its five 12V inputs. I built it a few years back, it's not pretty, but it does help diagnose bad PSUs.\n\nFrom power on to 460 watts (when OCP kicked in) it never once remained within the voltage tolerances of the ATX 2.3 spec, Guthix only knew what the 5V rail was doing as it snaked between 4.6 and 5.4V. Group regulation is likely what.\n\nThe spec as provided:\n\n\"**Lie**Gamer Desktop Tower Gaming PC\"\n\nIntel Core i7 7700**HQ**\n\n8 GB DDR4-**2133**\n\n**190** GB SSD + 2 TB **5940 RPM** HDD (**from the dawn of time**)\n\nNvidia GeForce **GT 430**\n\n**380 Watt PSU without any certification from anyone**\n\nThe spec as leaving me:\n\n\"**Wish Dot Com Fake** Gamer Desktop Tower Gaming PC\"\n\nIntel Core i7 7700HQ\n\n**16 GB DDR4-2400**\n\n190 GB SSD + 2 TB 5940 RPM HDD (from the dawn of time)\n\nNvidia GeForce **GTX 680**\n\n380 Watt PSU without any certification from anyone\n\nIt passes a 12 hour burn in with a heavy GPU load, so I'm happy with it going back out to play games.\n\nThe gent comes back asking for the damage report. I tell him I've given him a GPU upgrade to a GTX 680, from the 2010 GT 430 it had. The 1060 6 GB was a lie. I show him the plastic \"fans\". The CPU was also a lie, but a less serious one. The motherboard appears to be built for fraud.\n\nI tell him it'll now play a good few recent games, but not all of them. The GTX 680 in there is probably going to push the PSU a bit hard, but it should manage to stay upright. I tell him it's \u00a350, but to come back when he's saved up a bit of cash to get the PSU, RAM, and GPU replaced. \u00a3200 would do it and he promises to do exactly this.\n\nThe kid, still sat in the car, asks \"Will it actually play DX11 games properly?

The plate at the wall was labeled 9D. I head over to the network closet to take a look only to remember that nothing in the networking closet has a letter designation.

Turns out that she - and the dozen or so other photographers on the trip with her - didn't think of pressing the \"autofocus\" button on the camera.*\n\nI work for a company which hires out cameras and lenses. Recently I met a customer who was returning a telephoto lens which she'd taken on a very expensive wildlife holiday. I asked her how it went, as I usually do, and she replied that she didn't get any decent images with the lens because it wouldn't autofocus.\n\nHmm. It was certainly working fine when we gave it to her. We test everything, every time, to make sure we avoid awkward situations such as, say, when customers have hired kit to go on very expensive holidays and the kit hasn't worked.\n\nShe was on a trip with a bunch of other photographers, and naturally she asked for help. Most serious hobbyist photographers are only to happy to show off their knowledge, so she got lots of help. Apparently the lens had worked on some of their cameras, but not on hers, and nobody could work out why.\n\nI took it slowly and systematically. Does the focus ring turn smoothly, and can I see the optical elements moving within the lens? Yes. Mounting the lens on the camera, lens set to manual focus, can I focus manually? Yes. Lens set to autofocus, does it focus when I press the shutter button? No. Oh, that's interesting. Does it focus close up or in the distance? No, nothing.  OK, so does it focus when I press the Autofocus button on the back of the camera? ..... Yes.\n\nMost advanced cameras have extensive configuration options. You can set the metering and the autofocus to both be activated when you press the shutter button (that's the default) or you can separate the functions onto different buttons. They usually have a button high up on the back of the camera, where your thumb can easily find it, to activate the autofocus. The technique is called back button focus, and it has advantages in certain situations.\n\nSo our customer had somehow managed to set her camera to use back button focus, which requires a deep dive into the menus. But she's never heard of back button focus and didn't even know it was possible. And none of the other dozen or so photographers on the trip thought of pressing that big button labelled \"AF-ON\".\n\nWhen I got the lens back to base, I told my colleagues that the lens hadn't autofocused for our client.  \"Back button focus?\" was the immediate response.\n\nI just don't understand this.

We had about 400+ users and I had 7-9 help desk personnel.  A little remote capability (mostly push updates, scanning & such).  Well, I get on average 15-25 help-desk calls a day and pass them out to my guys in the morning and I also do some of the calls.  But like any help-desk it takes time to get to everyone.  We were using Win XP Pro (w\/DoD modifications applied) on all our machines and had restricted Admin access (we used Admin CAC cards) to only help-desk personnel.  I have 3 calls that I am working on and have to physically go to the PC and work the issues.  My 3rd call I get too at about 1045 hours, was a boot issue (most likely a corrupt win.exe file).  So, I go to the user's PC, and she says that she fixed it but can't get to her files.  I take a look at her machine and notice the log in screen is gone (WTF) and it is going straight into the desktop screen.  Except this is not a Win XP Pro desktop, its missing all the windows App suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc...). I go into settings and see the Win XP version and low and behold its Win XP Home Edition.  I popped the disk tray open and there is a Win XP Home Edition disk.  I asked her where did this come from.  And her response was one for the ages.  After she left a Msg about her PC issue at 0745 that morning, she waited around for 30 mins and she decided to fix it herself, so she went home (she lived on the base, so it only took 5 mins) and got her Win XP Home Edition disk.  Since she had rebuilt her home PC, she thought she knew what she was doing.  And since the PC in her work office was restricted to admins only, she thought it was a good idea to reinstall windows using her disk.\n\nWell, she booted from the CD and installed the Win XP home edition over-top the Win XP pro Edition and completely wiped\/formatted the drive.  All of data and apps were gone.  This infuriated me, I jumped down her throat telling her that she violated every term of her user agreement.  She didn't think it was a big deal. She couldn't understand why I couldn't just find her data\/files.  I told her that everything was gone (we did not have a separate or remote B\/U, everyone was supposed to do a weekly B\/U to a disk or a CD, which she didn't).  As the IMO I have the authority to suspend users access to the network and I promptly did so.  She now only had local access only with no network\/email or even network printer access.  I informed her supervisor of her suspension due to her violation of the Users Terms of agreement and he complained that she can't do her work w\/o network access.  Which I replied, that's his problem and I explained it like a taxi driver has their license suspended for cause, they can still get in the taxi but can't drive it anywhere.  Of course, he didn't like that I suspended her and went to the Commander and said I was being unreasonable.   The commander contacted me and asked for the reason, and I told him why.  He said he could order me to re-instate her, and I told him yea you could, but I would refuse & resign and go back to the states (I was a GS-11) and he could not stop me from doing that.  I asked him is it worth losing a GS-11 over a clearly incompetent and clearly in the wrong GS-6.  I would have also told my higher HQ IT people & the network signal battalion the issue so they would have leaked it to the higher chain of command and caused him a hell of bunch of trouble.  He backed off and her suspension stayed in place.\n\nI reinstalled Win XP Pro & all the apps on the PC that afternoon, so she could still work w\/o network access but when she needed to print or send files, she had to download to a 3.5 disk and give to someone and they had to do the print or send files.  Her suspension was for 45 days, but she was also required to do some remedial computer training at the computer training Lab next door which she never did, so her suspension stayed in place. At the next staff meeting I told every staff officer there that the computers are US Govt Property and not to be tampered with to 'Fix' an issue.  I also informed her supervisor in writing that I expect her Civilian Evaluation be noted of her failure.  But this was all for naught as she quit about 4 months after the incident.

I tell her it works on a computer and, if she has one, she's welcome to borrow my copy. I give her my phone number if she wants to take me up on the offer.\n\nHer son has a gaming PC, so she tries it on his computer.\n\nA week later and she's on the phone asking how much a PC to play it would be. At this point I don't really build them to sell anymore, but that doesn't mean I can't. I tell her, it'll be about \u00a3900 and, if possible, a tour of the farm for my nephew. There was no deliberation as she agreed.\n\nI build her a low-end gaming PC, 8 GB RAM, a dual core, and a fairly hefty video card, one of the GTX 400 series if I remember right. We're talking around eight years ago here, maybe a year more.\n\nWe decide to tour the farm at harvest season, so he can see all the different things used to harvest different crops, so this was a few months away.\n\nOn arrival, she says she's been playing the game \"one or two hours\" nearly every day and she's looking forward to the next release the year later. Her husband appears with a small tractor, hops the little lad into a side seat, and he's off to see the farm *on a tractor*.\n\nWhile this happens, I'm giving the lady a little advice about staying safe online, tell her there isn't really a solution to crap internet out in the country other than 3G cellular and 4G when it arrives, and fix a small problem she had with a printer.\n\nThe kid comes back with the widest grin any face could possibly fit telling me he'd seen some horses. I had no idea what \"horse trials\" were, but he did, and he's now telling me all about the Frickley Hall Horse Trials.\n\nThis has become a bit of a ritual. Now my son is 9 (he was an infant at the time of the story) and he's picked up the love of farm machinery, each harvest season we go see the farm, usually with me carrying some item of PC hardware the old lady wants to trick out her PC with. Last year, it was a Ryzen 5 5600X, motherboard, and 32 GB of RAM with an SSD to replace the base system. This year it was an RTX 3060.\n\nNow my son himself has a Switch and Farming Simulator on it, ensuring the annual farming PC upgrade will go on for some years yet!","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1664313700.0},{"title":"\"What's POE?\"","author":"TeaIsKindaOk","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/xpfl28\/whats_poe\/","text":"Background: We're a distributor that sell servers and other IT materials to installers.

I'll be $me, client will be $client, vendor will be $vendor.\n\n$client: Hey, while you're here, we have this other line that goes down every week sometimes two or three times. We narrowed it down to this single file.\n\nCutting out a lot of banter. Basically the PC that runs the automation periodically shuts off unexpectedly. It sometimes happens in parts of the plant but this machine is extra painful. After booting back up, the software fails to load correctly. Reinstalling takes too long, after an expensive call to their vendor, they narrowed it down to this single random program file getting corrupted. Copying an uncorrupted file from a thumb drive is their solution now, but a manager with access isn't always available. I don't charge as much as the vendor does, so here I am.\n\n$me: Well I mean, I could just write a script that copies that file over automatically on startup. It'll do it even if it doesn't need to but it's insurance.\n\n$client: *curse words* Are you serious? We asked $vendor if they could do this and they said they would \"consider it\" in the next software patch. That was 6 weeks ago.\n\n$me: They're probably trying to figure out how they can charge you for the next software update\n\nI slap together a script to run at startup that copies a fresh program file from another directory to the affected location. We head to the machine in question and I find the PC on a shelf, inside a cabinet, with less-than-great ventilation. Tucked in the corner on the floor I spot a UPS with lots of lights, I don't pay attention. Luckily the manager has access to the admin account, get everything in place, test it out for function's sake by holding down the power button and prove to the client.\n\nI return the thumb drive to the client and ask him how many other machines are running the same $vendor Brand of software that unexpectedly lose power.\n\n$client: All of them, we only have 22 machines running a different vendor's software and none of them have this problem.\n\nThe client points them out and they're in an isolated area of the warehouse so maybe they're clear. I still didn't like that only *this* machine corrupts a program file so I decide to take a closer look at the PC and UPS. I went to the UPS first and discovered that both batteries had swollen so much they couldn't be removed without dismantling it. Apparently the UPS was sending shutdown commands to the PC which is why they were more frequent on this machine. I show this to the client.\n\n$me: (with a very exaggerated tone) Hey, did you know this UPS is shutting down your machine and corrupting your file?\n\n$client: Hahaha, yeah right.\n\n$me: I think it's worth checking the machines that lose power, their UPS might look the same as this. Does your vendor supply these? They're in their cabinet.\n\n$client: Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I'll get the Parts team over. Can we check? Can you remove that script and backup file to see what happens if you just pull the plug?\n\n$me: You want me to deliberately remove power to a running piece of company equipment?\n\n$client: It'll happen eventually anyway, I'll pull the plug, you just remove the script.\n\nSo I remove the script and the safe copy of the program file. Reboot for posterity sake to show that the software *continues* to automatically log in looking for a job. Manager unplugs\/replugs the PC, we boot it up, and it *continues to automatically log in looking for a job*? Client asks me to verify the script is removed and of course it is. Parts team verifies that these UPS are supplied by $vendor.\n\nThe failed\/failing UPS across the warehouse was something like 40-50%, they didn't complete their count yet. We ended up finding an identical model that had good batteries and set it up with the problem PC. Deliberately let the PC and peripherals drain the UPS until it shuts down. Plug the UPS back in and let the batteries charge and the PC boots up to the desktop without launching the software... Do the same on another machine and it's fine, the problem exists in one PC.\n\n> Additional detail: Although all machine's are running $vendor's software every machine is unique, so is the software. If I had to guess, $vendor has between 30-40 unique applications they wrote over the course of 20ish years in this building. There are machines that do the same job but have different UI's because they were automated at different time periods.\n\nI don't understand why the shutdown command from an APC UPS corrupts $vendor's program file, but I guess I called it. The client was less than thrilled spending so much time chasing this.\n\n$client: Hey $me, I think I found a bonus for you.

The first is my home location, and the second is well over an hour away. Naturally when a proper hardware issue comes up in the secondary location, it's a real pain to coordinate a visit since we've been short-staffed for the last eight months. The users at these distant locations don't ever seem to understand that I can't just drop everything to waste half a day to head out there and back unless something is on fire.\n\nI was enjoying a good stretch of time where I hadn't have any issues at the secondary region, so it was about time that something were to come up. It came in the form of a failing UPS unit (uninterruptible power supply, for the uninitiated).\n\nAfter speaking with both my supervisors and the hardware lead, we all agree that due to our current staffing condition, we would mail the UPS directly to the location, and I would walk them through switching the unit over the phone. I can already hear your collective groans, but do remember that this would essentially be me driving 1.5 hours one way to walk in and spend 5 minutes swapping the unit over before driving back. The company didn't want to reimburse me for the miles traveled, and they didn't want me away from my desk.\n\nI relay this to the location manager who is immediately... I don't know how else to put this: ***terrified***. He's not angry. He's not frustrated. He's ***afraid***. As if the mere mention of doing anything remotely technical caused him absolute terror. He begins to almost plead that I drive out and do it myself, that nobody at the location has any idea how to do this. I assure him it isn't difficult, and as long as they follow my instructions, it will take five minutes max to square everything away.\n\n(Note: I did mention this to my supers, who doubled down and said just do it over the phone anyway. I would've driven out if they gave me the green light, but they didn't.)\n\nThe manager reluctantly agrees but says he will not be there the morning this needs to happen, and that the senior user will make the swap instead. He gives me their cell number and we arrange a time first thing in the morning. I let the network team and admins know this location will be showing as down at this time and to ignore the alerts.\n\nI had an extra new UPS unit in my office, and it's a good thing I did, because this unit was slightly different in its setup than what I had used in the past. No, not more difficult to set up. It's much, much easier. No need to plug in a cable, you simply flip the battery over and plug it in. Keep this in mind.\n\nThe next morning I call the senior user five minutes earlier than we had scheduled, and it's a good thing I did. Turns out, this user has gone rogue, and unplugged the old UPS unit well before I called, took the new one out of the box, and had been waiting for who knows how long, meaning the location had gone dark for that entire duration. I was a little horrified, but undaunted I started walking him through the instructions.\n\nFlip the unit on its side and remove the side\/bottom panel. For some reason this took him a good two minutes. Finally it was off.\n\nGood, now pull the battery out, flip it over, and turn it around so the white arrows are pointing into the unit.\n\nThe following silence began to last far too long and I got nervous. I asked, \"how's it looking?\"\n\nHe says, \"I'm peeling off the stickers.\"\n\nIcy horror. \"No. I didn't say to do that. You need to put them back exactly how they were. There are arrows indicating the proper side we need to slide into the machine.\"\n\nA deep, deep sigh, followed by two more minutes of messing around.\n\nBy some form of divine intervention he was able to get the stickers on right again.\n\nI said, okay, now put the battery green side up back into the UPS, the arrows show you which way to put it in.\n\nTwo minutes of silence. I ask if he's okay. YES, he says. Another minute. Another minute.\n\nFinally he says, \"okay, it's in.\"\n\n\"Great,\" I say, \"now put the cover panel back on.\n\nFive minutes follow of him grunting and muttering until he goes, \"it's not going back on.\"\n\nConfused, I ask him to send me a picture. To my utter horror he has somehow ***jammed*** the battery backwards into the machine, and got it stuck there. The bits of plastic that are used to guide the battery in and keep it straight are now off-center, and causing the siding of the UPS to bow outward.\n\nTo top it all off, you can clearly see the white arrows poking out from the siding ***backwards***, with big block text saying \"insert this way.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" I say, \"it's in backwards. You need to get it out and turn it around.\"\n\nAnother deep sigh from him, as if him screwing up is my doing.\n\nSeven minutes of the most miserable muttering I've ever heard from a human being follow, and then, \"WHY CAN'T SOMEONE JUST COME OUT HERE AND DO THIS?\"\n\nI think: because typically this is very hard to screw up this badly. I say nothing.\n\nA few moments later he is simply unable to get this battery out. I tell him, alright, put the other UPS unit back the way it was. Thankfully this was the only thing he was able to do right, and the location came back online (while the UPS couldn't hold a battery on its own, when plugged in like this, it becomes a glorified surge protector; again, for the uninitiated).\n\nI ask if there's anyone else on location to help us. He says \"NO, I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE.\" Which is strange because this location is due to open now in 15 minutes. I tell him we will think of another course of action and to leave everything as-is.\n\nBefore I hang up he says, \"what about the keyboard?\"\n\n\"...what keyboard?\"\n\n\"MY keyboard.\"\n\n\"What about your keyboard?\"\n\n\"Where do I plug it in?\"\n\n\"... I'm not sure what you're talking about.\"\n\n\"I had to unplug my keyboard. How do I get it back in?\"\n\n\"You... what? The keyboard for your station?\"\n\n\"YES!\"\n\nDon't ask my why this person unplugged his keyboard when his computer was nowhere near the UPS closet.\n\nI say, \"you plug it into the USB port, the rectangle-looking one. There are ports in the front and the back.\"\n\nAnother five minutes goes by, more muttering, more cursing from him. I try to talk to him as he seems to have me on speaker phone, but there's no answer. I call out to him several more times. Finally he says:\n\n\"CAN YOU HEAR ME!?\"\n\nTurns out he thought speakerphone has an unlimited range, and was yelling at the phone a good distance away thinking I could hear him. I tell him keep the phone close and I'll continue helping him. He then proceeds to walk far, FAR away from the phone FOUR MORE TIMES, and every time I tell him not to.\n\nThen he says, \"the keyboard is plugged in and still isn't working. Just come down here and fix everything! This is ridiculous!\"\n\nYeah, you got that right.\n\n\"Can you send me another picture?\" I ask.\n\nI then receive the picture of his desktop, and I immediately see a pattern. A real modus operandi. This man has taken the keyboard's USB plug, and ***JAMMED*** it into a Display Port, and while he claimed it was plugged in, you can clearly see the plug is three-quarters of the way out of the port and at an extreme angle.\n\nWhile I'm explaining this, he begins yelling at someone else: \"WE'RE NOT OPEN YET.\"\n\nI stop and listen. Silence.\n\nThen he tells me, \"I have to go, there's a gas leak. The fire station is here.\"\n\nI just kind of stare at the phone for a beat. He then yells at me, \"**AND SEND SOMEONE DOWN HERE!**\"\n\n*Click.*\n\nAt this point I'm reaching that glorious state of mind beyond anger and frustration which leads into hysterical incredulity.\n\n(If there really WAS a gas leak (I later found out there wasn't), luckily this new model of UPS doesn't require plugging in a cable that could potentially spark. I begin to wonder if he somehow hit a valve or pipe or something, but nothing came of this peripheral situation. Just another super fun speed bump.)\n\nSo at this point I steady myself, and begin the process of emailing my supervisors with all the details. I show them the pictures he sent me of the botched battery job and the keyboard, and my supervisors say, \"how the hell did he manage that?\"\n\nTrue to corporate fashion, a decision on resolving this matter wasn't reached until that afternoon. At first, they wanted me to drive over the same day after all (I wouldn't have gotten home until much later in the evening, well beyond my normal hours). I would've done it if they asked, I wanted to see this senior user in person after all, but at the same time I didn't want to cave to his demands of forcing me to drive over for something so stupid.\n\nWhat ended up happening was that one of my supers said they were headed that way for business the next day and could stop at the location to set the unit up themselves. Instead of that senior user being there, my super was let in by the MIA location manager. The one who was terrified of technology.\n\nMy super told him what happened with the senior user. The location manager says, \"yeah, he gets like that.\"\n\n... he ***gets*** like that? And you thought it was a good idea to have him in charge of this? Shoot, you thought it was a good idea to put someone like that in a ***senior position***? Interesting.\n\nMy super was able to remove the stuck battery in less than a minute, and proceeds to show the location manager how to install the UPS.\n\nThe location manger stares blankly for a moment and says,\n\n\"Oh, that was all? *I* could've done that...\"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1664062009.0},{"title":"Just Fix It!","author":"Wolphin8","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/xm6wt8\/just_fix_it\/","text":"This one is one I just had happen to me today.

I was a geek, and was trying out all the programs I could find. One of them seemed fascinating, but all I could make it do was spit out error messages.\n\nEventually I asked a professor, and it turned out that he'd written it as part of his Ph.D.  He explained that it was a general purpose macro processor, and showered me with documentation. It transpired that this included instructions for using it to translate itself for a new system. The year after, I did just that on a minicomputer to which I had access.\n\nFast forward another year, and I'm doing a Master's at another university. My speciality was (and is) operating systems, and I got to know a Ph.D student researching that area. We chatted, and I found out that he was manually translating that macro processor for a 12 bit minicomputer (it was such a tight fit that it had to be done manually). This was a spare time project for him.\n\nA few days later, I met him on the stairs. I asked him how the macro processor was doing, and he said it was all fine except for one weird bug. When it produced an error message, it forgot something called the 'insert environment'. Perhaps I could look at the code sometime?\n\nI replied that I didn't need to. He was corrupting the fourth word from the bottom of the stack, probably due to a faulty backward move routine with an off by one error. I then rushed off to my lecture.\n\nNext day I saw him again.

Are there Red, Green or no lights at all on the power button?**\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with many of these monitors in the past. But this location had some of the worst ones. Due to the configuration of the monitor itself, it had to be mounted upside down for it to fit amongst the other hardware. This put the power button and menu buttons at the top. Not easy to reach. Not easy to see.\n\n**Senior= there isn\u2019t any power button. Who designed this thing?**\n\n**Me= The button is on the top. The monitors need to be installed upside down for that model, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t fit.**\n\nI could imagine Senior craning his neck and climbing all over the dome glass of the Roulette machine. I prayed that he wouldn\u2019t break the machine itself!\n\n**Senior= Oh, ok. I see it.**\n\n**Me= \u2026?**\n\n**Senior= Are you still there?**\n\n**Me= Yes. Is the light on the power button illuminated? What color is it?**\n\n**Senior= Red light, it\u2019s solid\u2026not blinking.**\n\nGood Job Senior! At this point I was getting relieved. This may be a simple fix.\n\n**Me= Ok Senior, can you reach that power button to turn it on? Should be a green light once it is making its connection to the other monitors. These are all set up as an extended display, like having multiple monitors on a computer.**\n\n**Senior= What?!**\n\n**Me= Forget about it. Can you reach the power button? Might have to use a ruler or something to extend your reach.**\n\n**Senior= I can\u2019t reach the power button!**\n\n**Me= Use something long. Do you have a long screwdriver or something?**\n\n**Senior= Nope.**\n\n**Me= ?...**\n\n**Me= Is there any long piece of material that you could use? A stick or something?**\n\n**Senior= Nope.**\n\n**Me= Let\u2019s not give up on this. Can you go to your shop and grab a long tool or something to reach that power button?**\n\n**Senior= Nope.**\n\n**Me= ?**\n\nAll of the casinos have tech shops. And techs, especially Senior Technicians, have access to all their own tools at any given moment. What gives? I could not understand or fathom a casino with Techs that had no tools. Our machines had been running in these casinos long before I ever starting working for the company.\n\n**Senior= I think you might have to come over and fix this yourself.**\n\n\\*\\*Sigh\\*\\*\n\n**Me= Not a problem. I can be there tomorrow first thing. Let me confirm with my boss and I\u2019ll get back to you.**\n\nI confirmed with my boss that travel was allowed. Complete with hotel stay and Food\/entertainment expenses. The company vehicle wasn\u2019t bad to drive, but it was an older model Jeep Cherokee and this was the middle of winter with storms rolling in. Hotel stay was a must. Boss even approved extra expenses due to how he knew this was going to play out.\n\nI drove the company vehicle for the 5 hour trip. I didn\u2019t have to be at the Casino until next day. Got checked into my hotel, not the greatest. We were on the cusp of Covid and many comforts were locked down, such as breakfast. Their network was having issues. I fixed this easily. The hotel clerk showed me the network. The Unifi router was supplying POE (power over ethernet) to the access points. They just needed to be unplugged and plugged back in again. I received no compensation for my trouble. Not even a coke or a coffee. I went to my room and made my own damn coffee. A modified French press, using a $5 camping kit I got from Walmart, and a penny stove (alcohol burner) to heat water. The plunger came off my Bodom French press when the glass broke, and fits the Cylindrical Camp Cook gear form Walmart perfectly. I still use this today! Immersion Coffee is a much better brew than auto drip any day. I had a grinder. A modified Hand crank Coffee Grinder that I powered with my Makita 20v Drill! HOOYAH!! My travel coffee mug of choice, also from Walmart, is a Bubba Steel reinforced with Ceramic lining. COFFEE IS IMPORTANT DAMMIT!!!\n\nI connected my Roku Travel device to the TV and got that configured. I started catching up on Netflix episodes, but could not focus. I hadn\u2019t seen my Wife. We had a baby on the way, and I couldn't relax knowing all the projects I had to do. I was starting to also think about all the instances of simple solutions to issues that compounded into greater fixes. More in depth, replacing hardware, json files, etc.\n\nI settled down and fired up my laptop. Preparing for any eventuality for tomorrows escapade. I was knee deep into documentation and a second cup of Coffee. It was getting dark outside and the snowstorm was about to hit hard. Then the phone rang.\n\n**Me= Tech Support, this is Me from \\[Casino Gaming Service Company\\]. How can \u2026\u2026**\n\n**Senior= Where are you? When are you getting here?**\n\n**Me= Oh, hi Senior. We talked about that earlier today. You said tomorrow would be fine. Is everything else ok?**\n\n**Senior= I forgot. Sorry about that, I didn\u2019t mean to yell. Thank you for coming to help us out.**\n\n**Me= It\u2019s not a problem (of course it is). I\u2019m happy to help (unless you can do it yourself). I\u2019ll be there first thing tomorrow. Is Eight o clock still a good time?**\n\n**Senior= Better make it 10am. That\u2019s when the casino opens.**\n\n**Me= Are you sure? If someone is there earlier to let me in, we may have this fixed before Casino Patrons are even allowed to enter. I want to do right by you. That\u2019s all.**\n\n**Senior= It\u2019s all good. You get to your hotel ok?**\n\n**Me= Yes. Storm made the trip a couple hours longer than normal. But I\u2019m settled in. Had I known you were expecting me today I would have stopped in before checking into the Hotel. Are you sure you are good?**\n\n**Senior= Yeah\u2026we\u2019re good. Happy to see you in the morning.**\n\n**Me= See ya.**\n\nI immediately called my boss after, to cover my A$$ should this tech reach out to the company for any reason. Boss was cool. Similar conversation as I had with Senior. Drive, Hotel, etc. Even told him about the hotels networking issue that I fixed. Boss said I was a Beast and wished me good luck for tomorrow.\n\nIn the morning, sun was out, no snow falling, light breeze but still temperature in the negatives. I brewed my Coffee and packed up, checked out of the Hotel, and made my way to breakfast. The hotel didn\u2019t have any due to Covid. There was a bar that opened early however, and they did a decent steak and eggs. Afterward, I brushed my teeth in the parking lot and made my way to the Casino.\n\n10am\u2026No one at the front door to let me in.\n\nCalled Senior. No answer.\n\nI waited outside in the cold, with all my tools (just in case) and laptop in my Swiss Backpack. Only my Coffee to keep me warm in sub zero temps. (coffee is also a tool)\n\nAt 10:30am Senior greets me at the door and lets me in.\n\nSenior= Hope you didn\u2019t have to wait too long. Our security person is new and \u2018excuses\u2026excuses\u2026excuses\u2019\n\nI get checked in with security. They give me my Casino Temp Tech badge and I\u2019m ready to go to work. I make my way to the Roullette machine, and start getting a tool out to reach the power button.\n\n**Senior= I think the monitor is damaged. How long until it can get replaced.**\n\n**Me= If I replace this monitor, then all the other monitors may have to replaced as well. This is older equipment. Whoever installed this should have made notes to the company to get monitors upgraded so issues like these can be handled easier.**\n\nI grab a long flat head screwdriver from my toolbag and press the power button.\n\nThe monitor comes to life.\n\nI check the settings and configure the monitor to not go to sleep again. For this, I had a tool that plugs in, giving me handheld access to the menu system. No power button using this tool however. We still have to manually press the power button on the monitor itself. Strange, weird and annoying.\n\n**Me= You\u2019re all set.**\n\n**Senior= Really?**\n\n**Me= Yes.**\n\n**Senior= But you\u2019ve only been here a minute or two.**\n\n**Me= Over the phone yesterday, I troubleshooted with you and already determined the issue.**\n\n**Senior= You\u2019re a Beast!**\n\nI start packing up my tools. It should be noted that the tools consist of drills, screwdrivers, etc. Hand tools. Casino is supposed to provide any Basic bolts or nuts, washers etc. I had an assortment of these from previous visits to other sites. But I wasn\u2019t prepared for what was next.\n\n**Senior= The hydraulic arm on the Roulette machine is missing a nut. If we lift up the top I can show you.**\n\nSure enough, the bolt holding the hydraulic arm in place to a top bracket is missing a nut.\n\n**Me= I wasn't prepared to replace a nut on this machine. They were all used on another visit I just got back from, and haven\u2019t been to a hardware store yet to replace my stock. Can you go back to your tech shop and match one up for this bolt? If not then perhaps you would have another basic bolt, nut and washer combo that will work?**\n\n**Senior= No.**\n\n**Me= What do you mean?**\n\n**Senior= This casino doesn\u2019t have a tech shop.**\n\n**Me= Umm\u2026How is it possible that a Casino that employs techs doesn't have a tech shop? Every Casino I\u2019ve been to throughout the country has one.**\n\n**Senior= I don\u2019t know.**\n\n**Me= You\u2019re playing with me aren\u2019t you? Everything in your casino is held together with nuts and bolts. How does maintenance get any work done?**\n\n**Senior= I have no idea\u2026**\n\n**Me= You have to be joking.**\n\n**Senior= I\u2019m not.**\n\n**Me= So this Casino has Techs without means to do any basic maintenance? I\u2019m just trying to get the full story. I\u2019ve never encountered anything like this before.**\n\n**Senior= That\u2019s why we call you.**\n\nI kept my composure. I could feel the chro magnon ancestry rage welling inside of me. Begging to be released in full force on unsuspecting Senior.\n\n**Me= Ok Senior. I have your casino scheduled for Preventative Maintenance next week. I\u2019ll be back then and get this resolved.**\n\nI halfway expected him to let me know he was joking and bring out a nut that he had in his pocket the whole time. These things don\u2019t just get removed by themselves, and when installed are wrenched on like a gorilla!\n\nHe wasn\u2019t joking at all. This casino had no tech shop. The majority of techs, maintenance and all around staff were all elderly! What was security going to do in an elevated instance? Press their Life Alert Button and tell someone that they\u2019ve fallen and cant get up?! The tech shop was probably never conceived out of fear that some geriatric tech with Dementia might miss identify a small screw as a piece of candy! I knew at that point why we were so needed. Going forward I made every effort to get to that location first before ever checking into a Hotel, regardless of the situation.\n\nThat casino, and it\u2019s family of casinos throughout the region, were my favorite ones to visit. Senior and I got along well and had fun trading stories. I miss them now. All of them.\n\nI drove home after this visit, laughing the entire way! I reached out to Boss and 3-wayed with bigger bosses during the drive and gave them the story! They told me that I had at that point been truly initiated.\n\nI guess experience in manufacturing, Tool and Die, AutoCAD, CnC, The United States Navy Rescue Swimmers, and recent IT jobs were not taken into consideration for said initiation.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1663786594.0},{"title":"Tales from Desktop Support - The internship of Kevin & George","author":"techtornado","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/xkapk4\/tales_from_desktop_support_the_internship_of\/","text":"While strolling down memory lane, I remembered that my pet interns Kevin and George hadn't been written into a melodious sonnet in 3-part harmony that we all know and love as a Tale from Tech Support.\n\nAnyways, we're all students at a very prestigious university, #1 in the tri-state area, ranked #6 in all major football leagues and #13 in water polo. \n\nAs background, I was offered a team-lead-student-work-internship position after The Knack^(TM) was observed at the library, the work was doing mostly Mac desktop support and paid well too. \n\nThe cast:    \n$Kevin - For that is not is name - 4.0 GPA - no IT street smarts, no filter, now writes code\n\n$George - From chronicles of George    \nFirst year engineering student, loved to shred it on electric guitars, has yet to understand the laws of physics, did not write good support tickets. \n\n$Kara - Math genius    \nDestined for great things, handled the awkwardness of our dynamic duo, awesome and friendly. \n\n$Girlfriend - Now wife - would hang out in the office and either supervise us or do lunch ^((flirt)) between our classes.\n\n$Me - The intrepid hero, team leader extraordinaire, teacher of the teachers, boss of the bosses, expert of the experts, builder of the builders, the next Elon Musk... ~~no wait, we're getting ahead of ourselves~~\n\nKevin had a very curious disposition and really really really loved his anime.    \nHe couldn't focus on anything for more than 3.57 seconds before reverting back to his beloved topic. \n\nI was multi-tasking on a new PC deployment and asked him to start windows updates as part of the upgrade to Office 2016 and then return to HQ, I wrap up and then realize he didn't exit stage-left with me.\n\nCouldn't find him for the next iMac deliveries and after dodging the dangers of the fire swamp... again I found him sitting at the desk staring at the same computer instead of working with the rest of the office.\n\n$me - Ummm, what's going on?  \nWindows update runs in the background if you start it, you don't have to wait for it...\n\n$Kevin - I thought I had to stay for the whole thing (zombie voice) \n\nThere were other things Kevin did that were blocked from memory like not formatting a single ticket correctly or doing anything without having to be re-taught how to deploy a Mac or PC daily. \n\n\\*A few months later\\* \n\nHe finally reaches the end of his internship ^(and my patience) and I had encouraged him to branch out some and interview in places and spaces and he managed to make the finalist pool by sheer luck or a low barrier of entry. \n\n\\*Ding!\\* A wild new email arrives!\n\n$Kevin - Ooooh! I  now have two companies bidding for me... like a geisha girl!\n\n$Me - \\*Hisses\\* Kevin! That's not work appropriate!\n\nHe laughs it off after I lecture him about getting a lid or handle on not letting his inner thoughts become outward thoughts. \n\nAfter he graduated, I found his e-resume to be rather embellished for someone who didn't understand anything in the internship:  \nInventory management system (I was there, he didn't make one)  \nDocumentation that was very convoluted (I had to redo all of it)  \nImaging and deploying of PC\/Macs (I had to help him push the only button > next)\n\nOne day, he asked me what part of the tri-state area would be good to live in and the rental listings shared were in possibly the worst neighborhoods of the city.\n\n$Me - You can go there if you like a daily schedule of gunshots, gang wars, and police raids?    \nHe then found better places to live after whining about his budget.  \n\nEnter George:  \nOccasionally his schedule would overlap with Kevin, much to everyone's dismay. \n\nThey were in cahoots and when combined and a nearly unstoppable force of destruction if ever let loose on their own. \n\nThere was trouble brewing because they were constantly giggling like schoolgirls about something in Asian. \n\nOne day, they got on about some very 18+ raunchy Asian stuff in front of $Kara.   \n(thankfully not about her) \n\n\\*Verbal warnings ensued\\*\n\n$Kara blitzed him and rattled the desk.   \nI addressed them sternly and nearly broke the office door off it's hinges. \n\nThe girlfriend \\*stared at them in French\\*   \nI suspect that if they had seen her glare, they would have been instantly vaporized. \n\nAnyways, after that incident, short leashes were instituted and George managed to slip off for a repair ticket went at it unsupervised. \n\nThe ticket was to fetch and replace a broken classroom projector, and his claim to fame was to take it in a hand truck down a flight of stairs. \n\nThese stairs are 20ft\/6m away from the handicap ramp... I don't yell at people, but he learned how far I can project my voice outside ^((I surprised myself that day too))\n\nI then confiscate the projector and drag him to the install to replace it in hopes he hadn't turned the really important bits into sand.\n\nAfter a miraculous and blindingly bright test and while wrangling it into position  \n$Me - Screwdriver please  \n$G - \\*Hands me a wrench\\*  \nYaaas George that is exactly what I needed, now give me the yellow handled screwdriver \\*there\\* \n\nHe finally left stage right after a few more little issues of not being able to follow the simplest of directions. \n\nEndnotes:  \nKara finished her internship with excellent marks and her support tickets were stellar, cherished by the entire academic entourage and support staff.   \nThe girlfriend (now wife) didn't vaporize anyone else and we all graduated with excellence, she still flirts ;)","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1663780096.0},{"title":"The Cursed Laptop Model","author":"Epidexipteryx","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/xjjkyb\/the_cursed_laptop_model\/","text":"When I was working at a State department, our hardware contract was with Lenovo.

Bad WiFi connections? Always the Carbon X-1.\n\nWe had one lady, who I will call Needy, just loved her Carbon and wanted the upgraded model when it came time to update her hardware. I *tried* to convince her to go with another model we knew worked, but she was some big-wig and would stomp and cry if she didn't have her computer setup a particular way.\n\nAnyway, I had handed the deployment of this computer because I happened to glance at the ticket 2 seconds too long.

These analyzers were the size if a small refrigerator, with 6 or 8 separate electrical leads to read ALL your engine was doing, PLUS it had a vacuum pump with a 14 foot hose and 2 foot SS pipe that went into the exhaust pipe to read your vehicle emissions, weighed against timing, RPM, charging system, etc.\n\nMy customer base was 111.65% professional mechanics.  You know, the guys who troubleshoot YOUR car when it's not running right.  Guys who understand that you must check both electrical and mechanical elements of your car to find a problem.\n\nAt the time I was living in central NC and the customer in question was on the Outer Banks, near Nags Head.  On a GOOD DAY, at 55MPH (then the national speed limit) it was a good 5 hour drive one way.  Again, I repeat, a good day.\n\nWe would call the service desk throughout the day, to close calls.  Then get the straight skinny on Call B, call the customer for Call B, and schedule the work.  On the service call in question, the customer called the companies Service Line and reported that his analyzer was NOT working.   I found out that said customer in Nags Head had a problem late in the day, and called them immediately to see if I could solve this over the phone and save 10 hours of driving time.\n\nMe is ME\n\nCustomer is \"Ray\".   For in the dark ages, every old school auto shop was required to have at least one mechanic named Ray.\n\nMy Boss is 'Willy in Hotlanta\"\n\nRay's Boss is...well yeah...\"Ray's Boss\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI call the customer,\n\nHello, This is Ray at auto shop across the street from the ocean, , how can I help You?\n\nMe: Ray, this is ME, with (engine analyzer's inc) I hear you have a problem.\n\nRay:  hey Bo, YOUR machine is dead and we need it fixed asap. (technically it was his bosses machine, we just did the maintenance and repairs, based on his bosses yearly service contract...hold that point plz )\n\nMe: Ray, when you push the Start \/ Stop button on the front panel, does the pump come on, do the lights come on and does the countdown start on the CRT? (...yes a CRT...I said it was the dark ages)\n\nRay:  the lights are on.\n\nMe:  just the lights...but no pump sounds, no 3 minute warm up countdown on the CRT.  \n\nRay:..nope, nuthin'.\n\nMe:  OK, I'll be out there as early as I can get there tomorrow.  ( aw RAT SPIT!!!)\n\nFast Forward to 4:30 the next morning, huge thunderstorm wakes me up, stumble to the kitchen turn on the radio....tornado warnings, driving rain, reports of flooding...an interesting morning ahead all together.\n\n5:30  I leave the house headed east with Mother Nature playing games ahead of me.\n\nWhat with rain, wind, downed trees and numerous flooded road detours, the 5 hour Good Day trip took almost 8 1\/2 hours of miserable driving trip, and usually I love driving.\n\nGet to the shop, ask for Ray, he comes out of the office, and leads me to the machine, chattering non-stop about how backed up they were getting because he is THE only shop with an analyzer for 100 miles north, south or west.  East, was just salt water, of course!\n\nI get to the analyzer, hit the Start \/ Stop button...it...does...nothing.  No lights, no pump, not CRT ergo no 3 minute countdown....it did nothing.\n\nMe:  \"uh, Ray, I thought you said the lights came on but no pump noises...\"\n\nRay, looks up, points at the overhead lights, moves his hand in a BROAD circle and says...\"...the lights ARE on...\".\n\nMe:...\"no Ray, I asked if the lights on the MACHINE came on..pump stat, CRT, countdown... .\".\n\nRay,  \"...told you it does nothin'\", and he walks away.\n\nAfter a serious facepalm, I follow THE first rule of any ELECTRICAL troubleshooting, as it is, was and will always be, check to see if it's PLUGGED IN, regardless of the IT.\n\n(...hell, even Scotty on Star Trek knew that when the dilitium crystals crapped out, you gotta get new ones so you can get enough POWER to reach warp speed!...no dilitium crystals, no juice, no warp speed)  \n\n\nI trace out the power cable, which runs UP into the over head rafters, where it plugged into a loooong drop chord, that ran across the shop about 25 feet, down the back wall, to a plug, that was LAYING on the work bench next to what looked like a BRAND NEW grinder, which WAS plugged in.\n\nI waddled over cursing under my breath, knowing how this was about to play out, unplugged the grinder, plugged in the drop chord, waddled BACK to the analyzer, pushed the Start \/ Stop button....it lights up, the vacuum pump hums to life, CRT shows the 3 minute countdown...let it sit through that it hits zero, tells me it's ready, ran the diag, no trouble found All Systems Meets Operable Parameters.\n\nNow, remember the contract?  Ray's boss paid for maintenance and repairs, not PLUGGING IN stuff!

Ray's boss is now on the hook for 8 1\/2 hours of drive time, 42 seconds of tech time (on a 1 hour minimum) and 8 1\/2 hour trip return time, based on the original drive OUT there.\n\nRay went nuts when I told him HOW I fixed his problem, went nuttier when I handed him the bill.\n\nHe stormed into the office and handed it to his boss, who went even nutser...nuttier still.\n\nRay's Boss \" I won't pay it, It's not MY fault, I won't pay it!\"\n\nMe \"...well, I guess it isn't personally YOUR fault, it's Ray's fault and Ray is YOUR head mechanic,  so YOU have to pay, and if you don't, we'll cancel your service contract and ALL your future calls, for 12 months from today, will be out of pocket...I don't make the rules, I'm just forced to enforce them.\"  \n\nRay's Boss, \"I refuse to pay it...who do I talk to about this thing, I won't pay it!\"\n\nMe, \"I can call my boss, Willie in Hotlanta\"\n\nRay's Boss \" I have his number here!\"\n\nSo Ray's Boss dials it, puts us on the speaker phone box.\n\n...ring, ring, ring...\" Hello, this is Engine Analyzers Inc, I'm Willie in Hotlanta, how can I help you?\"\n\nMe \"Willie, it's Me...\" then gave him the whole nine yards, with Ray's Boss kibbitzing all the way through telling Willie in Hotlanta repeatedly, how it wasn't his fault and he refused to pay.\n\nWillie in Hotlanta \"...hmmm. \"...well, it sounds like it's NOT your fault Ray's Boss, (Ray's Boss is now grinning) ...but it does sound like it's Ray's fault and Ray is YOUR head mechanic,  so YOU have to pay, per the contract you signed, it says and you agreed to pay for drive and tech time brought on by YOUR shop practices.  And if you don't pay, I'll just cancel your service contract and ALL your future calls, for 12 months from today, will be out of pocket...I don't make the rules, I'm just forced to enforce them.\".\n\nRay's Boss gave Willie in Hotlanta a piece of his mind (which he truly couldn't afford to loose mind you) cursed a blue streak about how WE were crooks...then...gives his company credit card number to Willie.

Come with me\u201d and he grabbed some keys off the table and started down the stairs.\n\n\nI followed him to his pickup truck and climbed in the passenger side.\n\n\nOn the drive, Bob the Gab explained that he had a very important industrial customer and was using our equipment for shop-floor connectivity to a variety of systems. There was a PLC control network that was separate from the network we were on, but that they needed to pull data and interface at the server.\n\n\nIt was an RS-485 network spread over two factory floors. They had recently expanded from a smaller network, with one master system, and about ten slaves, to a much large network with over thirty slaves. I immediately thought it could be a termination issue; if an RS-485 run isn\u2019t terminated properly, there would be unpredictable results. I suggested as much to Bob the Gab.\n\n\n\u201cI fucking terminated it properly,\u201d he growled.\n\n\nI decided that discretion was the better part of valour and kept my mouth shut. I made a mental note to check it myself later.\n\n\nIt was only a short drive and Bob the Gab barged in and flirted with the receptionist. She seemed to take it in stride, had us sign in, gave us badges, and called our point-of-contact, Vinnie.\n\n\nVinnie was a rather nervous-looking chap, mid-forties. \u201cI sure hope you guys can get this sorted out quickly. I\u2019m getting a lot of heat from upstairs,\u201d he said, gesturing to the staircase behind reception. \u201cThe bosses like their production reports,\u201d he added.\n\n\nBob the Gab proclaimed loudly, \u201cNot to worry. The manufacturer sent us New Guy here. He\u2019s a genius when it comes to this stuff.\u201d Bob the Gab positively beamed when he looked at me. I was not so confident in my abilities.\n\n\n\u201cWhat can you tell me about the configuration?\u201d I asked Vinnie as he escorted us to the back.\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthe first ten systems on the red and blue lines are all on factory floor 1 and they work just fine. Green, Orange, and Gold lines are on factory floor 2, in building 2. The first dozen, or so, seem to be working okay, but the rest are either intermittent, or don\u2019t communicate at all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow long is the run?\u201d I asked.\n\n\nHe replied, \u201cIt\u2019s about 1200 ft. in building 1 to a total of almost 3500 ft. including building 2.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly within the spec for RS-485!\u201d Bob the Gab interjected, almost relieved. He gave me a sideways glance that made me uncomfortable.\n\n\nWe went to each system individually. I checked the voltmeter on each slave. At the end of the run in building 1 I checked for termination. It wasn\u2019t there. That was to be expected as the line ran on to building 2.\n\n\nIn building 2, I wanted to check the last slave first. It was properly terminated, but the voltages on the voltmeter were off. Strange. I checked the line, it was shielded.\n\n\n\u201cRS-485 works better with unshielded lines. It\u2019s designed to handle noise,\u201d I commented.\n\n\nVinnie nodded vigorously. \u201cBob recommended shielded lines. It\u2019s more expensive, but worth it as long as it works.\u201d\n\n\nBob looked angrily at me. He\u2019d managed to up-sell the cost for this installation and didn\u2019t appreciate my calling him out.\n\n\nHonest mistake on my part. Chagrined, I asked,  \u201cCan I use the phone? I\u2019d like to talk to one of our engineers back at the office.\u201d\n\n\nVinnie showed me to a production office on the floor and got me an outside line.\n\n\nI called the office and eventually spoke to Napoleon. I explained the situation, what I\u2019d found, mentioned the shielding, and asked his opinion.\n\n\nI could practically hear him rolling his eyes over the phone, \u201cThe shielding shouldn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s set up properly. I\u2019m sure Bob the Gab knows what he\u2019s doing. What about ground potential?\u201d\n\n\nI slapped my forehead when I heard this. It hadn\u2019t even occurred to me. \u201cOkay thanks,\u201d I said and hung up hurriedly.\n\n\nI went back to the nearest system to check. Sure enough both the shielding and ground wire were grounded locally. I checked some of the other systems and they all seemed to be configured this way.\n\n\nI looked at Vinnie and smiled, \u201cI think I know what the problem is. These systems all seem to be grounded locally.\u201d\n\n\nVinnie nodded proudly, \u201cYes, yes. I did that. I wanted to make sure everything was well-grounded.\u201d\n\n\nI went on, \u201cWell there is no such thing as a universal ground. There seems to be a difference between ground voltage at the start of the chain and at the end. That difference could mean the signal voltage is lost in noise. Let me try something.\u201d\n\n\nOn the first malfunctioning computer, I disconnected the ground connections. I also temporarily disconnected the downstream chain and terminated the connection. \u201cIn theory, this should be working properly now. Why don\u2019t you reboot and test it?\u201d\n\n\nVinnie happily did so and lo-and-behold, he was getting clear communications. All that was left for him to do was disconnect all the other ground connections, except for the first master system, remove the termination on the test machine, and reconnect the downstream line.\n\n\n...\n\n\nBob the Gab dropped me off at my car, begrudgingly thanked me, and went into his Gable.\n\n\nI was on my way back to the office. \n\n\nNikkie came over to listen to my tale as I sat down at my desk. \n\n\nMarie approached me and said, \u201cWe should go to lunch to celebrate your first success.\u201d\n\n\n(c) 2022 u\/crzy987","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1663445200.0},{"title":"How an Excel Support Post Fixed A Door Security System","author":"Naticus105","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/xg64cd\/how_an_excel_support_post_fixed_a_door_security\/","text":"This was originally just a comment, but as pointed out, it should just be its own post.

Confirms everything is borked, blames it on antivirus. \n\nClient calls me this morning before I get in. As soon as I'm capable of helping, but well before I'm sociable, I start looking. Immediately looked at services and had an AH HA moment because three of approx 7 or 8 services used that same account. Had the client update the password for the service configuration. \n\n1 service starts. \"well that was easy. \"\n\n2 services start. \"I'll just get this ticket updated so we can close it.\"\n\n3 services start. \"just let me know if this happens again.\"\n\n4th service fails. \"wait a second...\"\n\n4th service fails again. And again. And again. \n\nHmm okay. Wait, that user account is locked out. Unlock account. Seems good...... Wait, service won't start and 15 sec later that account is locked again. Weird. \n\nCan confirm it was not the service trying repeatedly doing it. Stop ALL the security services. Still consistently locking out the account in about 15 sec. \n\nNow I'm very confused. Event Viewer shows the security failure audits. But the failures talk about svchost.exe and those services are absolutely not trying to run right now, and no service is hopping on and off over and over. Confirmed with Process Explorer that we didn't have processes bouncing as it's super obvious in that. \n\nI start looking at all the errors in the application log and just started googling parts of the errors at random. Found a post talking about a DCOM problem with Excel. This is not an Excel problem unless Microsoft is now making door security systems. Whatever, let's see what people are saying. \n\nI notice one post goes into very detailed help about using DCOMCNFG. I've been in this app maybe 3 times in my >20 years in IT and it was never very useful for me. Talks about going into DCOM and looking for a component and checking the identity info, specifically about fixing username and password. Well.... I see dozens upon dozens of things in here but nothing looks relevant. I look at the unnamed ones that are only GUIDs and they don't match anything I'm seeing either. \n\nAlmost give up but decide to look in COM+ instead. Wait. Wait wait wait. There's two COM+ components in here that are named after the vendor's product. There's only maybe 5 things in here total so it was immediately obvious. Check identity and........ It's pointing to that user account. \n\nWe try to fix the password and it errors out. Try again and get same thing. Get the idea to have the password entered a third time, have the account prepared to be unlocked, apply the unlock, immediately switch and apply the password in the component. It takes. Still getting lockouts though. Repeat the same on the next component, fighting with unlocking. Takes. \n\nNo more lockouts. \n\nAll services start. \n\nApp opens and recognizes the server is available. Login works. The parts of the app that were being goofy before the vendor was called into assist and falsely blamed antivirus are now working perfectly. Reboot the server to ***just be sure***. All good. \n\nPhew. \n\nEdit the user description to include the words \"NEVER CHANGE THIS PASSWORD.\" Client laughs but agrees this is an appropriate designation and warning. \n\nAnd this is how I looked like a wizard while using an Excel support post helped fix a door security system.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1663370220.0},{"title":"Why is Word Flashing?","author":"flyingemberKC","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/xftime\/why_is_word_flashing\/","text":"I work in third tier support.  I mainly handle mobile device management and IAM tasks, but I also do advanced desktop troubleshooting.  If a problem gets big or is extra important our desk side support hands over an issue to the team I'm on.\n\nIn January 2019 I was handed a super special problem that dominated my next 45 days.\n\nMicrosoft Word was flashing.  Worse, it would often crash at the end and there was no document recovery available.  Trust me, we looked.  This problem was causing people to lose work.  This meant big money was being lost.\n\nThe symptoms was the user was just normally using Word and all of a sudden the document would blink.  No, not Windows, no not the entirety of the Word application, just the document portion itself.  I first saw the problem on a video and couldn't deny what was happening.\n\nSometimes it would flash only once, but sometimes the whole document would continue to flash on its own.  There was no interaction with the PC and it's sitting there continuing to flash.  It was like the document is being used by a DJ as part of a show as a flashing light effect.  At that point Word was gone, you had to crash it.\n\nAt this point what we knew is it would start to flash in response to doing something.  We knew nothing.\n\nWe had a hunch it was caused by one of our Word add-ins, we have a number needed for business and compliance reasons.  But we ran down patching, drivers, our Windows build.  Everything.\n\nI opened tickets with every vendor.  We talked about their product.  We talked about drivers and hardware build differences with our hardware vendor.  We even went so far as to ship hardware with our custom build to one vendor.  We brought in an expert from Microsoft into the office to work alongside us.\n\nFor weeks we couldn't figure out how to repeat the problem so we couldn't figure out if certain changes would fix it.  We confirmed it wouldn't happen every day for every user, someone might never have the problem happen again.\n\nThen at one point we got ahold of a laptop with the issue happening over and over.  We gave them a new laptop and used this access to finally identify how to repeat the issue on any computer.\n\nTo recreate the problem on demand I would make this insanely complex 1000 page document with hundreds of formatting changes.  Then I would do what I could only describe as being like a 3-year old.  I would violently scroll up and down in the document until it  would start to flash.  I would change to a second document of similar complexity and scroll in it the same way.  I would change to a third one, and so on.  I could watch Word's memory use jump as I did this sequence.  I could usually count on the flashing beginning when it reached an approximate point.\n\nBy this time we had limited the problem to Windows, drivers or one specific add-in that had to be on the PC for the problem to happen.\n\nApproximately one month in we finally identified the actual problem.  We needed to have hardware acceleration On in Office.  We had disabled it.\n\nWe identified the specific add-in vendor that had recommended it be turned off.  They couldn't explain why it needed to be off beyond vague reasoning that it fixed some problem they couldn't give the exact details on.\n\nProving that sometimes your entire problem comes down to that one checkbox.  It's kind of anti-climatic but if you work in IT you've been there.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1663340107.0},{"title":"User cannot make skype voice call - but refused to follow the troubleshooting process","author":"R1verw1nd","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/xfz1ed\/user_cannot_make_skype_voice_call_but_refused_to\/","text":"  \n\nThe post was start by [garysanthropology](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/garysanthropology\/) but [stfcfanhazz](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/stfcfanhazz\/) stated that \u201cIf that's software engineer, sack em\u201d\n\nSo I thought I share an issue I had recently with a software engineer. \n\nUser called in and stated that she could not make Skype voice call after losing connection to her network but she was already logged into Skype.

But there's just no escaping doing informal, familial tech support on occasion so long as one lives at home, I suppose. Have a tale of the technically barely adequate leading the technically blind!\n\n  The setup: My mother is not technically inclined. Fairly typical, I'd assume, she's not stupid, just not good with technology... Up to and including mechanical stuff. (At least she's not my sister, who for some reason genuinely doesn't understand why you can't remove the middle block of a layer of a Jenga tower if one of the side blocks is already gone...) \n\n  For some reason, my mother had recently decided she wants to get into voice acting and voiceover work, which, again, okay... If that's how you want to spend your free time, go ahead! I came home one day a good three months after she started doing voice auditions and the like to find her and my younger brother (also not technically inclined, but not technically illiterate either) trying to troubleshoot something on her laptop, with a big microphone set up next to her. I was soon roped into trying to figure out the problem they were failing to troubleshoot, by merit of them being set up at the dining room table within earshot of the entire house.\n\n  The problem: It started with a Windows Update. After the update, something in one of the programs she uses wasn't working. She followed a bunch of guides online and ended up uninstalling and reinstalling it... But no, it's still broken. There are two problems now; she can't 'click and drag' on a specific part of a specific program, and now no matter what she does there's an echo in everything she records.\n\n  The complications: I have absolutely no idea what she's been doing these last few months, why she uses the programs she's using, what her workflow is supposed to look like, how it might have changed due to the reinstall, or how any of the programs (at least three of them) are supposed to work, aside from having used Audacity once... six years ago... for high school Spanish class homework. \n\n  I'm good with computers and programming, but that's strictly on a 'putters around messing with things and learning at random' level, along with some basic programming knowledge and the scientific method to back up my madness. And she can't give me any more details than 'this isn't supposed to zoom' for the first problem, and 'it echoes!' for the second.\n\n  I did ask about settings, how she initially installed the programs... Nothing. For the purposes of this troubleshooting session, she might as well have had someone else do all of that. She remembers nothing, up to and including why she decided to use these programs in the first place. She can't really elaborate on what she did to uninstall and reinstall the programs, either, or what the initial problems were that made her decide doing so was necessary. My brother is no help either, being in the same situation as I, but with a much shorter temper that has already been exhausted by the time of my arrival. He does tell me he's done the basic 'google the symptoms and read what comes up' step, which I know he's proficient at, so that at least streamlines my approach a little.\n\n  So... Not good. I'm going in almost completely blind. I experiment with the 'click can't drag' problem first, and yes, she's right, clicking on the waveform just zooms in. No variation on the act of clicking produces anything besides the zoom and a dropdown menu with no relevant options. There are, of course, dozens of different settings up on the program's top bar that could be doing this, so I look for anything involving zoom, find the basic zoom in and out buttons... Using those doesn't reset it to her expected behavior. While I'm at it, I have her demonstrate the other problem. Sure enough, in her voice recording there's a slight, but noticeable, echo. These problems are indeed problems, which at least rules out some form of negative placebo effect (that damn update broke something!). I'm pretty sure from my vague memories that the click should be doing something other than zooming, and echoes are bad.\n\n  I fiddle around a bit, at a loss, but feeling certain that the click problem has to be something simple. It's almost certainly a setting somewhere. In the meantime, I field my mother's sometimes helpful but usually not assertions (\"no, I'm pretty sure the Windows Update didn't remove that feature from Audacity, that's not really how Windows Update works\", \"I don't think the update physically altered your microphone either, but it might have messed with a driver or something\") with my own only barely informed opinion...\n\n  Bingo! There's a tiny button tucked away in a corner with some variation of 'alternate mouse function' as the hover text! Set it to click instead of zoom in the dropdown, and one problem has been solved. My mother professes to have never seen that button before in her life, so even odds that she clicked it versus third-party intervention somewhere in her mess of mindlessly following youtube tutorials to reinstall.\n\n  But this was all just the easier of the two issues. Now we have to deal with the echo, and I'm dreading it. 'The final result echoes' is an intimidating problem when I barely understand what the programs involved do. She introduces me to her other audio programs, and I ask her what she usually does... Her workflow seems to involve recording something in audacity, then editing it on the fly with both audacity and another program, and then there's a third program that's involved somewhere afterwards. All of this is done with the process of someone who treats every function of every program as its own black box, and has learned how to get what she wants by performing the same arcane ritual each time, through trial and error, so, again, she's no help.\n\n  (It's genuinely impressive to me that she's gotten this far with no in-person assistance and minimal understanding of anything she works with, but that's a small comfort now, when the system breaks down and she can't tell me anything about why, where, or how it might be going wrong.)\n\n  Too many programs, too many steps. But... how is she listening to the final result right now? By replaying it in Audacity. Before any of the other programs come into play, it already has the echo. I breathe a huge sigh of relief at that information. Next up is reproducing the problem. The recording we've been looking at this whole time was made after the problems started, of course, but I get her to go through the process of making a new one right now anyway, to watch for obvious red flags.\n\n  She sits down, adjusts the microphone to point towards her, hits record, speaks. As she speaks, a half-second or so behind, the laptop starts playing the sound through its external speakers at a decent volume. I assume that's my fault (we were just listening to the older recording), have her stop, mute the laptop-\n\n  >\"Why did you do that?\"\n\n  >\"What do you mean? It was still playing sound.\"\n \n  >\"It always does that.\"\n\n  >\"Uh... To be clear: Whenever you record, the laptop plays it back while you're still recording. Out loud. Not into your earphones or anything.\"\n\n  >\"Yes.\"\n\n  >\"Are you sure this echo is a new problem?\"\n\n  >\"Yes!\"\n\n  >\"But...\" I try to explain what I'm thinking, with the appropriate pointing to illustrate my thought process. \"You make sound. Sound go in microphone. Microphone sends to computer. Sound come out of computer. Sound from computer go in microphone. Microphone sends to computer... this makes an echo. Right?\"\n\n  >\"No.\"\n \n  >\"No?\"\n \n  >\"No.\"\n\n  Okay, maybe the microphone is set up to avoid this obvious problem? I genuinely don't know if that's possible or what was happening for her prior to today. All I see is a microphone with one of those spit-guard things right next to both her face and a computer putting out audible sound. I'd like to just take her word for it... Actually, on second thought, I would prefer if she was wrong, because that would be a hell of a lot easier to fix than some other unknown problem. Regardless, we need to test this. I mute the computer and cajole her into making another recording, despite that not being 'how she does it'.\n\n  She records, with the laptop silent. We unmute the laptop and listen, after she's done.\n\n  No echo.\n\n  >\"Mom, you're supposed to mute the laptop while you record.\"\n\n  >\"But I never did that before!\"\n  \n  >\"I'm pretty sure you should have.\"\n\n  >\"But...\" She looks at the computer. \"But that's such a hassle!\"\n\n  I demonstrate the button combination that mutes the computer. \n\n  >\"It's two buttons, like this. See, easy.\"\n \n  >\"I don't want to do that!\"\n\n  >\"Uh... sorry? You have to. Think of it as a workaround.\" \n\n  That does it, thankfully. She thanks me and takes her laptop and microphone back to her room, leaving me to wonder if I actually found the problem, what the update and reinstall actually did, if anything, and whether it might have been prudent to burn down her program pile and teach her something simpler before the current mess comes back to bite me some other day.\n\n  (The next day, she tells me that I've fixed a problem that's plagued her from day one, a sneaky background echo in everything she recorded. One she never saw fit to mention before this moment. Even though I directly asked her. Oh, and also, do I know how to split an mp3 file into several separate tracks, in the file itself?)\n\n  My mother is a wonderful woman, but she is solely responsible for me knowing, from experience, exactly why I hate providing technical support.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1663349242.0},{"title":"First coffee, then tech support","author":"TechDude1701","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/xfvuim\/first_coffee_then_tech_support\/","text":"Hi!

She's not the brightest receptionist we support.\n\nA 7-10 minute drive later.\n\n> Me: So what are you scanning?\n\n> Her holding a wad of paper:  Just this.\n\n> Me: OK, show me how you scan. \n\n> Her: I hit scan and it comes up with this message, Why is this taking so long, I'm so behind on my work and my manager is getting cranky with me.\n\n> Me: The error message is insert paper into the scanner, why aren't you put it into the scanner?\n\n> Her: No, I don't put paper into the scanner, only the printer.\n\n> Me: But what's that in your hand to scan????? *** Oh god, she can't be that dumb, can she? ***\n\n> Her, looking at her hand and it being full of paper: But I don't put paper in the scanner, just the printer.\n\n> Me, with a look of disbelief: Isn't that paper?\n\n> Her still looking at the paper in her hand: No, I don't put paper into the scanner, only the printer.\n\n> Me: put what you want to scan into the scanner and then press the button.\n\n> Her: but I've always pressed the button then put the paper into the scanner.  \n> Me, knowing that scanners don't work that way: OK, it's a change of process for you.  \n> Her: but I don't like change.  \n> Me: I get that but your new scanner will only work that way.  \n\nHer manager apologised and advised that my new boss had gone over this but she didn't understand.\n\nI'd love to say this was the dumbest thing I had to put up with while I was there however I would be lying.\n\nTLDR: end user doesn't want to read and won't put paper into the scanner before pressing scan.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1663292690.0},{"title":"I can't sign in...","author":"garysanthropology","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/xf8q3d\/i_cant_sign_in\/","text":"Engineer: \"I can't sign in to my payroll account on my new laptop, can you help?\"\n\nMe: \"IT doesn't have access to tge payroll system, but HR would be able to help with this matter.\"\n\nEngineer: \"Ok\"\n\nAn hour goes by...\n\nEngineer: \"I still have my old laptop and I can sign in on that one.

He has a problem with an old software that won\u2019t start anymore. A software we don\u2019t offer nor officially support.\nI asked for his contact details, phone number, E-Mail and so on.\n\nTo try to help the person, I remoted into the Laptop and let the user show me the issue.\nIt was a software from 2012, he told me he had talked to the software provider and couldn\u2019t get support for it anymore. And they apparently aren\u2019t able to transfer the database.\nSo I tried my best to understand what was going wrong with the software and maybe fix it.\n\nSince it had been about 45\u00a0min already, I figured it wasn\u2019t worth to keep trying and told him, that I would talk to the software support and asked if he had a number to call them.\n\nSo he opened up an e-mail that was sent to him by a sales person, with a number at the bottom. \nI read through the e-mail, and they already sent him 3 official resellers for their new software. But didn\u2019t say anything about not being able to transfer the data.\n\nJust gave them a call, and they confirmed, that there was no update possible.\n\nSo I called the user back and told him, to go with one of the resellers in the e-mail.\n\nThen I remembered that I didn\u2019t ask for a street address. Called him again, asking for it.\n\nHe asked why we needed it, I told him that there\u2019s some paperwork that comes with calling for the first time.\nHe asked if we would send an invoice for that, and I told him that we do.\n\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t even solve the problem!\u201c\n\n\u201cNope, I didn\u2019t.\u201c, I said, a bit confused.\n\n\u201cYou called for help with a software you bought from someone else, I helped you as best as I could and came to the conclusion that this is nothing we can solve in a reasonable time. Would you please provide me the address, please?\u201c\n\nHe didn\u2019t and kept insisting on not getting an invoice. So I transferred him to my boss. I told my boss what happened. This took 1\u00a0min to 1.5 min.\nIn this time the call from the customer disconnected. We came to the conclusion that he won\u2019t give us the address, and we will talk about it with my bosses boss.\n\nBut since he had already given us his name, company name and phone number, I looked it up on Google and what came back was an address and another phone number. No website though. I think we are not the only people he doesn\u2019t want to pay.\n\n I figured I would try to give the number to call, so I turn my caller ID off and called the number. You could clearly hear that somebody picked up, but said nothing. I asked if I was talking to <user> and just got a quick \u201cNo.\u201d back.\n\nThe voice suspiciously sounded like the one from the person I talk to before, so I also asked about the address, to which I also got a \u201cNo.\u201d from the user.\n\nBoth no\u2019s sounded more like a very panic \u201cOH FUCK! OH FUCK!\u201c\n\nSo it obviously was the person who called. I just said that we will send the invoice and everything, but just got nothing back. \nTold him to have a good day and hung up the phone.\n\nDon\u2019t try to outsmart people who get paid to solve problems 8h a day, or rather don\u2019t be a problem for them.\n\nTL;DR - User called us instead of the support of the software he was using. Then complained we couldn\u2019t solve his issue and wouldn\u2019t give out his address for an invoice. Turns out his address was on Google and I surprised him by telling him his address.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1663103112.0},{"title":"I don't trust what customer's\/end users say anymore.","author":"Brilliant_Floor_3991","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/xdbvnn\/i_dont_trust_what_customersend_users_say_anymore\/","text":"I have lost the count on how many times I ask a customer to try a quick fix or try something over the phone.

I try clear the CMOS, check all the cables are plugged in, and can't find any issues, except for the sata power cable looking a bit different from the rest, and it not being fully seated. I try unplug it, and what do you know, it works! Plug it back in, and the computer is dead as a doornail.

It reminded me of yet another \"$Red\" story. (If you're not familiar with \"$Red,\" the half-ass network administrator in the IT department at $MidwestCollege I ran, you can find one of the first stories here: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/8a5om8\/thats_not_how_any_of_this_works\/)\n\ntl;dr: $Red didn't want to actually do any work.\n\nI managed a college IT department for a few years in the mid-2000s. Before I was the Director, though, I managed the support organization of the IT department.\n\nThe semester before I started at $MidwestCollege someone had CC\u2019d \"All Campus\" about the food in the dining facility.  As you would expect, it snowballed from there. *(Myriad emails about \"the food sucks\" and \"you should just hit the food truck that parks on the edge of campus\" and then hundreds of emails complaining about the food truck, etc. And \"remove me\" and \"don\u2019t reply all,\" of course.)*\n\nUpon hearing this story, I asked the Network Admin, $Red, the obvious question if the \"All Campus\" and similar distribution lists were now locked down now to prevent this.\n\n>$Red: \"You can\u2019t do that.\"\n\n>$Me: \"What? No, you absolutely can. And we must.\"\n\nSeems he\u2019d been told by our $ITVP that it was a violation of \"academic freedom\" to not allow 1,500 undergrads the opportunity to just wantonly spam the hell out of the campus community, crush people's inboxes and keep the staff from getting their work done.  By then I had already figured out that $ITVP didn't like it when people questioned her decisions. Even suggesting that there was a cheaper, easier or more effective course of action to what she wanted done was looked upon as being \"difficult\" or \"disloyal.\"  Huh. \n\nBesides, $Red and I were peer-level employees and I had no real ability to tell him to do anything. Even when the answer was right in front of his face.  OK, well, I'll just file this away under \"Stuff I'm Going to Change Someday When I'm the King.\"  \n\nWe had a couple more instances of students spamming the \"All Campus\" email, but it was made tougher by me going in to the Exchange Server and hiding the distribution lists from the Global.  But it kept key people from seeing it, so we had to unhide it. (yes, I know there were ways to create a local contact so the senior administration could send, but that wasn't the point..)\n\nAfter a year or so, $ITVP flamed out, I was named Director and suddenly $Red worked for me.  \n\nWe had a change in campus leadership and IT reported to our new $Provost. $Provost was very tech- and business-savvy, having come from an educational tech startup. And he was not easily bullshitted by the likes of $Red's handwaving like $ITVP was.  In one of our first meetings, I mentioned the previous problems with the All-Campus distribution list and the $ITVP's insistence that students must be allowed to \"freely share ideas\" in that way, and to restrict that or any other distribution was a violation of \"Academic Freedom.\"\n\n>$ITVP: \"What? No, that's totally NOT what Academic Freedom is all about.  Feel free to lock those lists down.\"\n\nI went to $Red and directed him to lock down \"All Campus,\" \"All Staff,\" \"All Faculty,\" and \"All Students\" to just a select group of people in senior administration, campus safety, IT, residence life, academics, etc. \n\nHe grumbled about \"academic freedom\" and claimed that since $ITVP had told him to leave them wide open, that should be good enough. *(the real subtext was: he didn\u2019t know enough about email administration to properly lock down these lists and grant permission to a select few to send, and he didn\u2019t want to do the work, anyway)*\n\n>$Me: \"Here\u2019s the thing: You do what I tell you to do. If there\u2019s heat to be had about that decision, I will take it. Thats _my_ job. But your job is to manage the  network, servers and email systems in a way that promotes security, lets people get their jobs or duties accomplished, and improves business efficiency.

The whole lot. There's barely half a dozen of us that work here, so depending on how far I get with any particular issue, I pretty much double as Tier 1\/2. The bare bones of $BOSP are 20 years old now (our installer still installs the MS Access 2003 runtime, and a copy of Jetcomp dated 1999), but a lot of interaction with it is automated these days. Orders coming in, instructions going to the warehouses and such, for a good chunk of our clients, is completely hands off.\n\n\nPurchase orders on the other hand, are only *mostly* automated. $BOSP will quite happily calculate what it thinks you need to buy in, based on any future dated orders that are loaded in, and on any set numbers you want to keep stock at. It's even usually pretty accurate with it! But a lot of people still do this bit by hand, simply because a lot of money rides on it. Which leads into the story at hand..\n\n\nI get a call from a lady at one of our clients who's trying to check the stock of a certain item they're selling. $BOSP has a few numbers available for this, raw numbers of how many of the item are in your various warehouses, the item's \"Free Now\" stock (current stock minus any existing unfulfilled orders for the item), and the item's \"Free Future\" stock, which looks at purchase order data, to tell you what your \"Free Now\" will be in, say, 2 months time, when a bunch of purchase orders have arrived.\n\n\nShe tells me $BOSP is showing her the raw stock, and the free now, just fine. But when she tries to view the free future stock, $BOSP \"absolutely panics\". I can tell I'm not going to get much more useful information out of her over the phone, so I remote in and see for myself.\n\n\nAs she clicks into the free future section, $BOSP does indeed absolutely panic. The table that displays the information starts flashing white, and the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom shrinks very very quickly. It then promptly crashes, giving one of it's usual generic unhelpful error messages. Huh.\n\n\nOnce I get it started back up again, I try it with another item. Nope, doesn't do it. That pretty conclusively tells me it's something to do with the data itself, rather than any software issue. So, armed with that knowledge, I start looking at the various tables $BOSP uses to calculate that free future number.\n\nI go through customer orders, current stock, nothing out of the ordinary.. But then I get to the purchase order table.\n\n\nFor context, the screen that was going nuts, shows each month in the future as a column, but it only displays as many as it needs. If your most distant purchase order is only 3 months away, it'll only show 3 months of data, in 3 columns. Now think back to the scroll bar earlier, and the title of this post, and I think you'll see the issue.\n\n\nSure enough, after sorting the purchase order table by delivery date, descending, there lies the culprit. A purchase order for the item, dated 2202. After a quick bit of testing, yeah, \"un-fat-fingering\" the year on the delivery date makes $BOSP no longer have a fit while attempting to display 180 years of stock info.\n\n\nAnother one to add to the pile of back burner bugs that'll likely never get worked on.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1662769362.0},{"title":"Short but sweet, slack doesn't work","author":"npaladin2000","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/xa392e\/short_but_sweet_slack_doesnt_work\/","text":"Ok this one is good.

The company I worked at was small but efficiant and worked mostly with BTB (Business to Business) telephony. While we had no direct technical control of landlines and telephony, we worked closely with providers. Handling firstline tickets like sim-card activation, providing a system that gave the companies a comprehensible overview of their different connections, which fixed lined number was connected to what mobile nr etc.\n\nWe had a list of all known associate companies that provided services, so if somebody called us in error to discuss an invoice from a provider for example we could tell them which departmen\/person\/company they could call. We rarely called providers unless customers payed for us to be the middle man. In those cases we would be the one to call the providers with technical issue.\n\nSo, the company had just enlisted a new client. Mainly the new client was working with healthcare. They had more than a few hospitals and domestic services. They were paying for mobile support and to have the overlook of \"which landline goes where\" solution but not really for the \"tech support to provider\". Reason being that they were switching providers so. Mostly I helped them with resetting iPhones, porting cellphone plans or issues related to it and\/or forwarding them to department which could help them with their fixed lines. But since they called often regarding fixed lines, I had read up on how their solution was set up and would sometimes help them with basic troubleshooting. They had a lot of different solutions however so it was impossible to keep track of all the details for each building.\n\nOne day, I get a call from somebody that sounded like their heart was about to explode in their chest. After many \"calm down\" \"what seems to be the matter\" etc they got around to explaining how their entire hospital was without internet and fixed line telephones wasn't working. This had happened once or twice before for other hospitals due to the porting so I asked if they had been briefed by the suppliers about the outage and explained that the outage should only be very brief. \n\nNope, the lines just went dead. I tried to de-escalate the tension and explained that the fixed line gets rerouted to their mobile phones so as long as they have power then at least the calls would be getting through. However, this particular hospital was special. Special in the way that more than domestic services and basic health care, they also had an emergency room. The fixed line to emergency, which was connected to a special landline, was seperate from the other lines. So even if the regular lines was cut, it would still operate. That line was also down, so if there was an accident, then emergency services couldn't get through and ambulances wouldn't be dispatched. As it was, the hospital was slowed to a crawl.\n\nI was pretty young at the time and I didn't know what to do. NORMALLY, I would refer them to the provider but this time I just felt like every second they spent on the phone meant two hands less in the hospital. I called up the provider to see what was going on. I jumped through a lot of \"I'll forward your call\" hoops until I got to the person in charge but all they could tell me was that the lines were down and that they had no idea why. The port had gone through weeks ago with no issues. They were also hard at work trying to figure out what had gone wrong.\n\n....what?\n\nI am sort of panicing. I don't know why I felt so responsible but I kept digging. And digging. And digging. To be honest, I am not sure how the hell I wound up where I did. But I found myself talking to somebody working in municipality and I asked if they knew of something, anything that would explain this. They said the only thing they could think of was that some work was being done in the rural area next to the hospital. I asked for a number and after some convincing I got it. \n\nI reach some loosey-goosey guy and I hear machinery in the background and barely make out what he is saying. I explain very briefly who I am, why I am calling and what they are doing and if something has happened. With a scoff, almost a laugh, he says that while digging to lay down broad band cables, they've accidentally severed \"something\" but they've filed a report and that somebody should come around to fixing that \"in a couple of weeks\". I sort of blacked out. I just remember my colleagues worried expression peeking over their screen as I scream and rant. Almost a minute of silence on the other end and the silence broke \"I'll see if our guys can work overtime if you can get someone here ASAP.\"\n\nI call back to the provider and explain the situation. Again, I cannot believe the arrogance. \"its almost closing time, we'll resume this tomorrow\". Again, black out. All I remember screaming is \"ITS A HOSPITAL! They take care of PEOPLE!!\". Again silence. Again \"We'll send someone\".\n\nMidday the day after, it was fixed.\n\nI don't know what I expected to happen next. But I didn't quite expect for it to go so quiet. The client didn't call to thank me. The provider didn't either. Not a word of thanks from anyone. But I guess if thats what I was after, I am in the wrong line of business. The boss at least gave me a \"well done\" and a christmas bonus.

One of our clients was $Onions, an agribusiness that would buy onions in bulk and turn them into 10lb bags of frozen onion soup. We took them as a customer the day they spun off as a legally distinct entity from their parent company, so some growing pains were inevitable, but boy did they push it.\n\nWe're calling them $Onions because the more you pealed back the layers, the more you cry.\n\n$Onions had a web app for clocking in and out, another for changing pay destination, one for supervisors to put in writeups, and so on. But they were managed by one HR program, The One Program To Rule Them All, or $TOPTRTA.\n\n$TOPTRTA was a web app that did this fun thing where half the page would not load. Imagine $favChatProgram, where there's a side panel with some info, a top bar with more specific info, and the main page with all the texting. It was like that, but the main panel wouldn't load no matter what you did. \n\nFirst call for \"$TOPTRTA is broken :(\" went something like this:\n\n> $Me, while doing general web troubleshooting: I'm not familiar with this program. Can you tell me what you use it for?\n\n> $HR: Well, right now, I need to use it to [something incomprehensible] so the last shift gets paid on time\n\n> $Me: Excuse me? You need to do what?\n\n> $HR: Basically, the first thing the payclerk has to do is [something incomprehensible], which lets the previous shift get paid on time. I *can* leave this for the next payclerk, and the last shift will still get paid, but it might be delayed by a week. \n\n> $Me: And how many people would be impacted by this?\n\n> $HR: Hmmm.... I'd say about 500 people. I'm pretty sure that's how many people are on that shift at this plant. \n\nThis client defines a ticket worth escalating as \"a severe issue\", which is helpfully vague enough that after spending an hour the problem, I decide this is worth waking someone up at 2AM over. After an hour of calling any number I could find hoping against reason that someone, *anyone*, would pick up the damn phone, leaving two or three dozen voicemails, getting hung up on by the $generalProblems number because \"call the HRIT people\", then having my call ignored by the $generalProblems number, I ask my boss what to do. She tells me to escalate the ticket, document how many calls I made, call the person back and tell them that it will get resolved during regular business hours.\n\nI quickly fall into a habit of trying anything my permissions would let me on the off chance it would help, escalating the ticket, making one call, then being done. Most of my coworkers just escalated on contact, having fully given up on either actually being able to fix the problem or being able to reach one of the thoroughly worthless HRIT people (more on them later).\n\nOne of the last times I got this call (as I quit shortly after), it went something like this:\n\n> $Me: $Onions IT, this is $Me. Can I get a name and number please?\n\n> $HR, muffled: Hey, I got him!\n\n> $Me: ???\n\n> $HR: Boy, I sure I am glad I through to you. It sure feels great having you atleast try. I know $TOPTRTA is a piece of crap, but it really feels good to have you atleast trying.\n\nI have no idea who this person is, but their opening was probably somehow more fawning. \n\nMake a ticket, try my best, give up, apologize, start to escalate the ticket.\n\n> $HR: Hey, my boss did have a question for you though. What are we supposed to do if there's a fire?\n\nThat was the exact phrase. It's been years, but his voice asking that question is stuck, nailed, riveted, and glued into my brain. Not angry. Not accusing. Just, concerned. \"What are we supposed to do if there's a fire?\" \n\n> $Me: I don't understand. What do you mean?\n\n> $HR: So there's about a thousand people working on the assembly line 24\/7 at this plant, and more when there are office staff in. If we have to evacuate the building because of a fire, or shelter in place because of a tornado, HR is supposed to take our laptops with us. There's so many people on site that the only way we could get an accurate headcount is with $TOPTRTA. So, what are we supposed to do if there's a fire and no one can get into it?\n\nI don't remember what happened next. I think I said I would find out, apologized, and hung up. \n\nThere was no management on that shift for me, but when the day shift boss showed up I asked him.\n\n> $Me: Hey, you know $TOPTRTA?\n\n> $Boss: And how it's a huge piece of shit? Yeah, go on.\n\n> $Me: Is there a solution for it being such a huge piece of shit?\n\nHe made a sound that told me I was just picking at a fresh wound\n\n> $Me: So what are they supposed to do if there's a fire?\n\nAfter I explain the situation, he looked at his phone, wrote something on a sticky note he left on his desk, wrote something else on a different sticky note, said something about \"preparing for a meeting with $Onions\", and excused himself.\n\nThe following night I showed to a fresh, department-wide email, which read in full:\n\n> $TOPTRTA does not impact production, so do not contact the on-calls regarding any ticket for $TOPTRTA. Don't try fixing it, just escalate.\n\nThat was it. \n\nSo, what are they supposed to do if there's a fire?","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1662564322.0},{"title":"\"Don't worry, I work on data centers.\" \"I know, that's what worries me.\"","author":"JallerBaller","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/x7xrfw\/dont_worry_i_work_on_data_centers_i_know_thats\/","text":" I don't work in IT, and in fact I don't consider myself *particularly*  tech-savvy, but I have the intuition to be good at searching for the  solution to problems and the confidence and experience to actually carry  out the solutions, so I regularly find myself playing the role of tech  support for friends. This story is about one friend in particular, who  it seems like every time he comes to me for a simple problem, it reveals  a cascading series of other problems with his computer. For instance,  he previously asked me how to change his desktop background, which  revealed he didn't have a copy of Windows, and while I was finding a key  for him, he casually mentioned, \"hey do you know why it does this?\"  referring to his *entire screen stuttering and vibrating*. \"Yeah it's done that ever since I got it but I just kinda ignored it.\"\n\nAnyway,  the most recent thing, during which the title happened, was that he was  playing Total War Warhammer III and the textures were funky. So I asked  when the last time he updated his drivers was. \"How do I do that?\" Ok,  so probably the last time I showed him how to do it, over a year ago. I  told him again, and AMD's software popped up saying that there was an  error with a mismatch in software versions and to reinstall it. So I  walk him through navigating to Apps & Features to uninstall it so we  can reinstall, and lo and behold, AMD Software isn't even listed as  being installed. So I have him try to install the newest version, and it  stalls at some random percentage. Looking online, it seems likely that  there's broken bits of old installation leftover, and running DDU to  clean it up before installing is likely to fix it. So we go to run DDU,  and it recommends doing so in Safe Mode, which I don't know how to open  off the top of my head, so I find the Microsoft Support page for it, and  we get to the point of clicking 'to restart in Safe Mode, and as it's  doing so he says, \"Will this work though? My computer doesn't restart  right.\" ...? \"Every time I try to restart my computer it just gets stuck  on the restarting screen for a long time and then it crashes and I have  to turn it back on myself.\" As he's explaining, this exact thing  happens, and the computer does not boot into Safe Mode. So I ask why  he's never been concerned about that before, and he says, \"I don't know,  I just thought it was inconvenient,\" and as a joke adds, \"I work on  data centers, [u\/JallerBaller](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/JallerBaller\/),  it's fine, don't worry,\" because he is in fact a civil engineer who  works on data centers, and I said, \"I know you work on data centers,  that's what worries me.\"\n\nSo  I read over the rest of the Microsoft Support article, and every  strategy for getting into Safe Mode seemed to involve the computer  restarting itself. Which it wasn't capable of doing. Thankfully, I  thought \"surely you can spam an F key during startup or something,  right?\" which, through more Googling, I confirmed *was*  another way to get into Safe Mode which the Microsoft Support article  neglected to mention, and it worked. So we ran DDU, tried to reinstall  AMD Software and... it didn't work. It still hung at a random, different  percentage. \\**Facepalm*\\* So at that point I told him that I think he may have to find a computer  shop near him or something, because I'm reaching the limits of my  knowledge. My dad is a programmer, so I asked if he has any other ideas,  but that's basically where we're at right now lmao. Oh, and I forgot to  mention that during all this he was complaining about how his computer  takes a long time to boot, \"ever since you helped me buy those new  drivers last year.\" ????? Drivers, or drive? \"Yeah the hard drive you  said I should get.\" Because the last time he had asked me for advice  about buying computer parts, he had complained about long loading times,  and I told him that the bottleneck was definitely his hard drive, and  getting an SSD would make a huge difference. Come to find out, he did  buy an SSD, but he kept Windows on the hard drive and just transferred  Steam to the SSD, even though I distinctly remember telling him that if  he wanted his computer to boot as fast as mine (\"holy crap [u\/JallerBaller](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/JallerBaller\/) your computer is done restarting already??\") he would need to install Windows on the SSD.\n\nThis is my first time posting here, so I hope I haven't broken any rules (my dumb ass somehow missed Rule 4 and my first time trying to post I included a reaction image). We still haven't found a solution, but I'm not really *looking* for a solution here, I just thought it was a funny story that you all might enjoy, so I hope I'm not breaking Rule 3.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1662532287.0},{"title":"It doesn\u2019t work","author":"oldNcranky16","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/x7nhn1\/it_doesnt_work\/","text":"Ok I\u2019ve read the rules so here goes.

Equipment purchased by departments other than us with grant money got a red tag, equipment acquired by other departments on their own dime got yellow tags, and equipment we supply has green tags.\nIt's rudimentary but it keeps organization simple enough. These tags follow a basic ID structure too, the third letter at the beginning of the inventory tag changes based on what type of tag it is. \n\nSo one day out of the blue, a department head contacts me about a 'missing' laptop. We'll refer to her as $KAREN today as that's how she was behaving. $KAREN shows me a receipt of laptops she had ordered and claims one specific model is missing and that they can't find it\nin their department. $KAREN had been so kind to append the PDF receipt with the proper inventory designations pertaining to said laptops expediting what would otherwise be a giant headache. I notify her I'll look into it and scrounge around our inventory management system. \n\nAnother important aside for today's story is that recently our new guy was tasked with setting up and deploying a remote access tool that was a lot more powerful than our typical remote support solution. This RAT had the capabilities of letting a technician access a computer without the user's knowledge, letting you run and deploy updates in the background, heck it would let you delete files and folders on machines without even logging into them. It was also set up to where once it had been installed you would be able to remote into the device regardless if it was connected to our network or not, or even synced \nwith our active directory. On top of this our AV solution was modern enough to display the last known power on time of a device and the last user logged into it.\n\nWith this knowledge at my disposal I was able to quickly ascertain that the 'missing' device hadn't been powered on for a month and the last known user was someone from $KAREN's department. I shoot her back an email with this info, notably using cropped screenshots of these logs as proof of what I know along with CCing my boss and network admin into the chain of emails just in case $KAREN decided she did not want to be responsible today. $KAREN did not, in fact, want to be responsible today.\n\n$KAREN fires back an email quicker than I can get up to go refill my coffee. $KAREN's telling us that doesn't make sense, as last known user's last day at her department was coincidentally the last shown day that the laptop was powered on. $KAREN claimed that \nshe must have given us the laptop to be wiped and baselined for the next employee and that it had to have been misplaced and configured for someone in another department or fallen by the wayside. \n\nI politely respond to $KAREN, letting her know that I double checked our office and the laptop isn't here. My boss replied to the email too, putting his foot down and reminding her that because of the policies in place the only responsibilities our department had \nregarding this laptop was making sure it worked and was set up to be used - all inventory management and any other responsibility fell on her department. $KAREN agreed to disagree, still absolutely certain that her department wasn't in the wrong here.\n\nI decided to respond one final time, assuming this would end the discussion (wrong). I reiterate that our logs show the machine 1) hadn't been powered on in a month and 2) the last shown login was a user from her department (the RAT that had been set up would also allow usto remote into the machine if it had truly been powered on at all, yet it also showed the machine as unreachable as it was not powered on of course. $KAREN didn't need to know we had this tool though). I continue, addressing the accusation that if the machine had wrongly been inventoried and sent out to another department, it wouldn't show up in the system with the original inventory designation - the computers were renamed to their inventory tags to keep consistency with everything. It would also show that someone else had logged into it, whether it was a local account or one of our admin accounts we use to do set ups. \n\nAt this point it seemed like she gave up this battle and for a week or so we had all nearly forgotten this back and forth occurred as typical work flowed through. This didn't last long though as $KAREN reached out to me on my personal cell phone while I was in our network admin's office going over something in active directory. I answer the phone and put it on speaker (without telling $KAREN). She opens up with a plea, asking me not to tell my boss she called and goes on saying our logs surely must be incorrect that there's no way her department has the laptop. I look at my network admin's face which is completely agape. I respond and tell her I can check our office one more time but that we really don't have this laptop and that the logs don't lie. I ask her why she didn't just reach out to the last known employee who used the laptop in the event they took it home with them and forgot to bring it back (or stole it, though knowing said employee that didn't really seem likely). She says something that I didn't really pay attention to and hangs up. My network admin's look of astonishment transformed into a belly laugh. He really couldn't believe the audacity of this woman and I couldn't either.\n\nI take it to our boss who calmly states that he'll take care of it. I think nothing of it and file this whole thing at the bottom of my priority list - I confirmed we didn't have this laptop and any more effort spent trying to find it would be pointless. I push it to the back of my mind and continue on like nothing happened. After a month I began to notice that $KAREN was no longer addressing me personally and seemed to be avoiding our department. I ask my boss what happened and he told me that after bringing this to the attention of the board of commissioners, they sat her down in the public forum and let her know that if she continued to not comply with county policy she would be reprimanded. In the case of the board addressing a department head specifically, being reprimanded meant they'd be 'encouraged to quit' or so my boss says. I've still barely heard anything from $KAREN to this day.\nIf her department has issues, it's her employees that reach out to us instead.\n\n**TLDR;** As Sun Tzu once said 'screw around and find out'.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1662479884.0},{"title":"Mouse Problem","author":"HetElfdeGebod","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/x70hp7\/mouse_problem\/","text":"My first IT job was on a helpdesk for a national media monitoring company.

MacOS 9 was still dominant, with OSX a scary and mostly incompatible threat on the horizon.\n\nOne day I was called to swap the positions of two users' workstations, a completely routine bit of office rearranging. So began an unexpected and bewildering journey.\n\nAfter swapping the client macs around one of them was fine - but the newer model client Mac could only see one of our two file servers on the AppleTalk over Ethernet server discovery protocol. The other had vanished.\n\nWe had two servers, their greek names Hera and Zeus preceding my tenure at the company. At the time I think Hera was an older mac desktop used as an AppleTalk file server. Zeus was a somewhat newer WinNT4 box using NT's AppleTalk over TCP\/IP support to share files with our MacOS 9 client machines. Hera was only used to control an elderly Panther laser imagesetter so file server performance didn't matter much.\n\nMuch swapping of patch cables, port jiggling etc yielded no improvement. I moved the machines back and they both worked fine. I swapped them over again and used long patch leads to use their original Ethernet wall ports... and both still worked fine. Swap them to use the port closer to their new location and the new model Mac would misbehave again.\n\nBoth wall ports were connected to the same 100baseTX switch. *(I think it was a switch. It might have been a hub, actually, we were pretty primitive there.)* In either case swapping their patch leads at the switch end had no effect on the situation.\n\nI eventually gave up and left them with their over length Ethernet cables patched to each other's wall ports. So it remained, despite occasional user complaints about the long cables.\n\n ----\n\nSome time later....\n\nThe contract cable tech came out to run some new Ethernet for some new wall ports. At the time I was a green admin who didn't know how to do that.\n\nThere's no way I would've gone into that crawl space even if I *had* been competent to run the wiring. The rats down there were the size of cats. Also, the cable guy once got shocked by some live wires lying exposed in the dust near the dusty mummified corpse of an electrocuted rat. I'd once encountered a massive rat under a verandah and I wasn't keen to repeat the experience in even tighter confines.\n\nHe was down there long enough that I was contemplating asking for volunteers for a search party.\n\nHe eventually emerged alive into the light. As brushed  the dust, spiderwebs and fur off his coveralls he reported that he'd found and fixed a rat -munched cat5e cable while he was down there.\n\nWhen he punched the new cable in i saw it was port 11.\n\nThat port.\n\nSure enough, I swapped the patch leads over and the newer mac could now see the server just fine.\n\nAt this point it is important to know that the newer mac had 100baseTX Ethernet. The older one had 10baseT.\n\nBoth of them use only 2 of the 4 pairs in a cat5e cable, so it shouldn't have mattered. But it did.\n\nWhen connected via the munched cable, the newer client machine with 100baseTX machine could only communicate with the older server Hera that used native AppleTalk. It was unable to exchange traffic with the 100baseTX NT4 server Zeus reliably enough to complete AppleTalk over TCP\/IP discovery or establish a working session.\n\nThat Ethernet cable only liked AppleTalk.\n\n---\n\n*I hope I remembered this right. It was over 20 years ago and the details have faded. It might've been the other way around with the servers, where AppleTalk over TCP\/IP worked but native AppleTalk didn't. I don't remember if \"Hera\" had 100baseTX or 10baseT.*\n\n---\n\n**Bonus story**: The same place once had an Ethernet port that killed Ethernet hardware. Plug a machine in and the machine's Ethernet port would never work again. It took more victims than it should've before the culprit was identified. Remember that mummified rat? Well, the sparky came out and descended into Hades. He reported that a somewhat fresher rat was shorting a loose live wire across to the Ethernet cable it had been snacking on. It must've closed the circuit when it bit into the conductor. Semidried rat is not a great conductor, but apparently sufficient to fry Ethernet hardware that isn't expecting 240V straight to the nipples. Remarkably, the switch was unscathed other than a single fried port.\n\n*Server names have not been changed, though nothing else in here is identifying. If you recognise the workplace, I'm sorry for the pain we shared.*","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1662422456.0},{"title":"Laptop screen turns off in the 3rd floor meeting room","author":"ActualTechSupport","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/x6g378\/laptop_screen_turns_off_in_the_3rd_floor_meeting\/","text":"One early spring morning a ticket comes in titled \"Laptop screen turns off in the 3rd floor meeting room\". This sounds too good to be true of course so we call the user and ask for some more details.\n\nApparently this issue comes up frequently, nearly every time they are in that specific meeting room, never at their desk. To see if we can figure out the issue, we schedule a time when we can meet in this room and ask the user to use their laptop as they normally would during a meeting. Of course the laptop screen stays on, and we conclude that this is a user issue and not equipment issue, probably just the user pressing the sleep button on the keyboard. The user did not like this, but went their way.\n\nFew weeks later, a new ticket comes in, \"Laptop screen turned off again\". We told the user to be careful around the F keys, and closed the ticket.

We checked and reseated it, but it was still not working.\n\nAt this point I had a kinda stupid but not completely illogical idea that the keys might been disabled by Windows or something. I quickly flashed a Live Linux distro on a USB stick of mine and booted his pc from it. While in the BIOS menu to select the boot device, I have seen something that at the moment I thought it is irrelevant.\n\nIn Linux the keys still didn't work, so for sure it was a hardware faliure. We rebooted back into windows and he showed me how painfully slow it was. I checked the task manager and showed that his HDD was at 100%. The only time I have seen something similar was when my ex-gf showed her laptop being slow. That one only had a single HDD in it. With a lot of cleaning and tweaking, I did manage to make it faster, but G's Legion had an m.2 SSD (not sure if sata or nvme, but irrelevant anyway), so I didn't understand why the HDD....\n\nThen it hit me. The BIOS. In the boot order I have seen the ID numbers of the drives, which usualy consists the initials of their brands. The second in the order was a WD (Western Digital) sign. In the task manager I could see the actual make of the drives and sure enough, WD was the SSD.\n\nI couldn't believe what I'm seeing. So I launched File Explorer and navigated to \"This PC\". The Windows drive was 1TB and the D:\\\\ was only 250GB. Both of them consisted authentical Windows root folder trees. Tho the HDD had some aditional folders as it was supposed to be used as secondary.\n\nI asked G \"Didn't you update to Windows 11 btw?\" \n\nG: \"I did, but since yesterday it is Windows 10 again....\"\n\nI: \"Oh my f god!!!\"   \nI rebooted, changed the boot order to the SSD and Windows 11 was greeting us, with much-much snappier speed and all the files back in place. The Task Manager showed that the SSD already finished booting, idleing at a couple of % and the HDD was not even used.\n\nI burst out laughing on the absurdity of this situation. My friend also cracks a short bittersweet laugh, tho it was understandibly furiating him, that he is basicaly back where the whole thing started. At least he got his money back when he reported earlier that they did not fix his issue.\n\nEnd of the story is that thankfuly our Legions have numpads, so he have another set of the missing keys to use, but using a faulty laptop in Uni is not a good idea. I suggested finding a donor and so we replace the keyboard, which he considers, but also thinking about getting a Thinkpad instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy does he have two copys of Windows? - you might ask.  \nThis is a short story G told me on the spot when I asked him the same.\n\nWhen he bought the laptop, it only had the 1TB HDD. Then he got the smaller SSD, but didn't want to risk installing it as he have never done that before. So he took the Legion to a shop and asked them to move Windows onto it. Fair enough, they did install it and copied the operating system with all it's settings and user files, but did not delete it from the HDD, and my friend didn't really think about it or noticed.\n\nWhy didn't they delete it, I am not sure. More experienced redditors might have the correct answer for it.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1662328843.0},{"title":"IN WHICH I MET BOB THE GAB","author":"crzy987","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/x5sojp\/in_which_i_met_bob_the_gab\/","text":"[<<Previous](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/wvr7rc\/in_which_i_learned_to_prioritize\/)\n\n\n[First](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/wla3yn\/in_which_i_was_convinced_to_help_a_damsel_in\/)\n\n\nEric was a bit of a strange duck. We had taken an undergrad course together many years ago and were even roommates, briefly.\n\n\nEric had learned a cool trick: by switching his major every few years, when he was just shy of the credit requirements, he could extend his stay, in the mythical quest of becoming a permanent student. He was now seven years into his three year degree.\n\n\nHis current major was Philosophy, although previous majors included English, History, and Italian Literature.\n\n\nIt was the weekend, he had a paper due at the beginning of the week, and he couldn\u2019t get his word processing software working. I agreed to take a look in exchange for beer and pizza.\n\n\nHe had a 386 desktop system with an amber display. I sat down at his desk and powered up. I popped open a can of beer and took a long sip. Glancing out the window, it was absolutely gorgeous out; the kind of day to sit by the pool. *Sigh*. Oh well. \n\n\nThe DOS prompt appeared and I typed \u201cwp\u201d to start the word processor. However instead of the familiar splash-screen referencing a software company based in Orem, Utah, I saw:\n\n\n**C:\\wp**\n\n**It\u2019s time for a math test.**\n\n**And the question is...**\n\n**What is 39 * 14=**\n\n\n\u201cOh! That\u2019s interesting,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cYup,\u201d Eric replied.\n\n\nI scowled, \u201cSo what happens when you answer the question?\u201d\n\n\nHe took a sip of his beer, \u201cIt just says \u2018Wrong\u2019 and asks another question.\u201d\n\n\nI looked at him, \u201cWhat if you put in the correct answer?\u201d\n\n\nHe shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t have a calculator.\u201d Math was never Eric\u2019s strong suit.\n\n\nA quick bit of mental math: *10 times 39 is 390, 2 times 39 is 78, 2 times 78 is 156, 156 plus 390 is 546*.\n\n\nI entered the answer and voila, the familiar splash-screen appeared. \n\n\nEric was gleeful, \u201cYou fixed it!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, not really. This time, but I think the problem is still there. Let me make a phone call,\u201d I said reaching for the cordless phone.\n\n\nCordless phones had really improved over the past few years. The conversations were encrypted so that anybody with a walkie-talkie couldn\u2019t just listen in and batteries could last up to almost an hour when fully charged.\n\n\nI called the university computer department. It was the weekend, so most facilities were shut down, however people needed to print 24\/7, so the computer department was always staffed.\n\n\nA fellow named Entwistle answered. Now, I happened to know Entwistle. I had been a frosh-leader during orientation week over several years and Entwistle was one of my frosh. His father was a minister at an historic church in a nearby city. This only became relevant because he exposed himself by stripping completely at a party during his time as frosh and we blackmailed him mercilessly. He was forever known to us as \u201cTall Frosh.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHi Tall Frosh,\u201d I said, \u201cThey\u2019ve got you working this weekend?\u201d\n\n\nHe recognized my voice immediately, \u201cHi crzy987, yes working but the money\u2019s good. What can I do you for?\u201d\n\n\nThere was another fellow in the computer department, Steven, who was really good at this stuff. I had his home number written down at home, but didn\u2019t want to drive all the way back to get it. I knew his number was on the bulletin board at the computer department, saving me a few steps.\n\n\n\u201cCan you get me Steven\u2019s number off the bulletin board near the red filing cabinet? I need to ask him about something.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSurely, give me a minute.\u201d\n\n\nWith that, he gave me Steven\u2019s number, we said our good-byes and I was on the line with Steven.\n\n\nSteven was on the deck by the side of the pool in his apartment building. His cordless was good enough to provide signal from the eighth floor to the ground level.\n\n\n I explained the situation to Steven.\n\n\nHe said, \u201cYes, we\u2019re beginning to see a lot more of this on campus. Lots of international students, people exchanging copies of software. There\u2019s a fairly new type of \u2018joke\u2019 software called computer viruses. They\u2019ve been around for awhile, but only recently are beginning to affect ordinary users. I\u2019ve got a scrubbing software diskette that should fix your problem.\u201d\n\n\nAnd so this was my first encounter with a computer virus. I drove over to Steven\u2019s, copied the program, then went back to Eric\u2019s to scrub the virus from his system.\n\n\nHalf-an-hour later we were eating pizza.\n\n\n...\n\n\nZipping in and out of traffic, I made it to work in forty minutes. A sane person would do the same drive in sixty minutes, but I was young and thought I was *indestructible*.\n\n\nI walked in the front door, but didn\u2019t see anyone. The lights were on.\n\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d I called out.\n\n\nA smiling face popped out of one of the offices.\n\n\n\u201cHi, you must be New Guy! Welcome. I\u2019m Marie,\u201d she said matter-of-factly.\n\n\nI introduced myself and she waved me to a desk near the front window, \u201cYou\u2019ll be over there.\u201d\n\n\nA tall blond fellow meandered in and sat down at the desk opposite me.\n\n\nMarie continued, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who stole my keyboard?\u201d\n\n\nI blushed, \u201cSorry about that.\u201d\n\n\nBlond guy burst out laughing, \u201cClassic! You\u2019re the first one to do that. Two other people figured it out by just bending the pin back into position. The rest just gave up. One guy snuck out and we never saw him again. By the way, I\u2019m Peter.\u201d \n\n\n Peter beamed.\n\n\nI stammered, \u201cWell, I tried bending the pin first, but it broke off.\u201d\n\n\nMarie chimed in, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. Napoleon likes it when people can adapt and think for themselves.\u201d\n\n\nNikkie came in and sat on the piano stool, which had since relocated to this office area. \u201cGood to see you,\u201d he said, looking at me. Then he turned to Peter. \u201cBob the Gab is complaining again.\u201d\n\n\nPeter rolled his eyes and groaned, \u201cThat asshole is going to be the death of me. What\u2019s his problem this time?\u201d\n\n\nNikkie frowned slightly, \u201cI dunno. Something about our industrial controllers are \u2018fucking shit,\u2019\u201d Nikkie made air quotes while saying those last two words.\n\n\nNapoleon wandered into the office and nodded at me.\n\n\nPeter pointed a thumb at me, \u201cWe don\u2019t we put New Guy on it, to see what he can do?\u201d\n\n\nI would later find out that Peter was an expert in secretly ~~avoiding~~ delegating work.\n\n\nNikkie\u2019s face brightened, \u201cThat, my friend, is a SUPERB idea. Give him the info and let him run with it.\u201d\n\n\nNapoleon interrupted, \u201cDon\u2019t give him anything. Show him how to use the database and let him figure it out for himself.\u201d With that he turned and retreated to his office.\n\n\nNikkie gave me a quick run-down of their database. The interface was a simple terminal prompt that ran in DOS connected to a DB2 backend. After showing me several keyboard commands, I was able to bring up the contact information for the customer.\n\n\nPeter said, \u201cLet me call him first to introduce you.\u201d He picked up the phone and dialed.  After exchanging several expletive-filled insults, he put Bob the Gab on hold and told me to pick up.\n\n\nI spoke to Bob the Gab and he demanded that I get my ass over there immediately to fix whatever his issue was. I put Bob the Gab on hold and asked Nikkie if that was all right.\n\n\nNikkie said, \u201cNormally we only provide telephone support, but Bob the Gab is an important customer. He\u2019s not too far away from here.\u201d\n\n\nI picked up the phone and confirmed with Bob the Gab that I would be there shortly.\n\n\nPeter escorted me to the back, into the same room where I had the technical test previously. The tall, bald guy with thick glasses was there.\n\n\nPeter said, \u201cThis is Pawel.\u201d\n\n\nPawel looked up and nodded at me.\n\n\nPeter said something to him in what sounded like Polish.\n\n\nPawel looked pissed-off and looked at me accusingly.\n\n\nHe opened the filing cabinet and retrieved a satchel before handing it to me.\n\n\nI looked in and there was a multitmeter, a soldering iron, flux, solder, some tools, and wire.\n\n\nPeter said something else to Pawel in Polish. The only part I could understand was \u201cBob the Gab.\u201d\n\n\nPawel rolled his eyes, reached up to a shelf and grabbed a couple of circuit boards, handed them to me, then shooed us away.\n\n\n...\n\n\nForty-five minutes later, I was standing in front of the address I\u2019d retrieved for Bob the Gab. \n\n\nIn the front window, was a neon sign: **Bob\u2019s Computer Gable**. But several of the letters were burned-out, so it read: **Bob t Gab**.\n\n\nI opened the door and was faced with a rickety staircase leading up.\n\n\nI went upstairs and seated on a couch was a rather large, Jabba the Hutt looking fellow.\n\n\nBob the Gab looked over at me squinting, \u201cAre you New Guy? I\u2019m going to fucking throw you through that wall if you don\u2019t get this fixed.

I ask them to elaborate for me and they tell me it just keeps going to a white screen every time they restart instead of to the login screen. *Oh no.* I know exactly what's happened and it's the first time that this has happened at this job.\n\nI go to the user's location and take a look at their laptop. Sure enough, the laptop is sitting at the boot menu. The solid state drive isn't listed as a boot device, only PXE boot. Well, no big deal - all of our users are set up to have shortcuts to shared folders over the network and are instructed that anything important they have should be saved there. I inform user that the machine should be under warranty and that I'll just go retrieve a new one for them. Before I go on my way to get a replacement baselined for them, they seem to start panicking.\n\n>USER: So you're saying all the data on the drive is gone?\n\n>ME: Yes, it seems like the solid state failed. This is not a common issue at all but, all of your documents saved to the shared folders are on a server so you shouldn't have lost anything.\n\n>USER: ...\n\n>ME: You were saving your work to your shared folders weren't you?\n\n>USER: ...No, I wasn't. It was taking forever to transfer documents onto it so I just saved them to a folder on my desktop.\n\n>ME: That's weird, it shouldn't take that long to transfer documents onto the server and you know that the IT disclosure form you filled out when you got employeed said to save your work into the shared folders.\n\n>USER: Well it was taking forever because I was working from home over WiFi! This is a huge problem I just lost 4 months worth of work!\n\n>ME: *Internally facepalming* So you were working from home for a while and didn't think to save all your work upon getting back?\n\n>USER: I got really busy and didn't think about it! This is completely unacceptable, I have so much work to catch up on, can't you do anything?\n\n>ME: Like I said before, no. This is why those shared folders are set up. Sorry.\n\nAt this point I couldn't tell if they were ready to blow a fuse or completely break down and I didn't care to stick around and find out. I got back to the office and got their new machine ready to go pronto for them and finished setting up a service request on the old machine. I then made sure to send out a PSA to every user reminding them to back up any documents they have if they haven't done so already and told my boss we should start sending out similar PSAs every month to drill it into our users' heads.\n\nBy the time I got back to our user in question they accepted defeat and begrudgingly took the replacement laptop from me. I felt bad for them and gave them my condolences and went on my way.\n\nPlease use your shared folders. It will save you heart break and it will save us head aches.\n\n**EDIT\/UPDATE:**\n\nA comment below has a fuller description but, our new guy somehow managed to get the machine going without data loss and backed up everything to where it needed to be.

For some background I work as a sysadmin for the local government and recently I had been out of the office due to COVID and just got back.\n\nAround my lunch time I got a voicemail from a user explaining that they had needed to call 911 and weren't able to do so with their desk phone (for the record, everything was fine they just had to use their cell phone and luckily nothing bad happened).\n\nThis was odd to me, as we use a phone system everyone and their brother is certified with it seems, and if they were unable to call outside the internal network they typically couldn't get calls from outside it either and this department is pretty quick to notify us when there's issues.\n\nRecently, while I was gone, our network admin (who's been in the field for about 15 years and is my boss when my actual boss isn't here) and the new guy worked with a contractor to redo our network cabling. This included redoing network closets and the racks. Some of you may see where this is going already.\n\nSo, after some extensive trouble shooting and digging through the back end system for our phones I discovered that the router that was in control of the device pool this user belongs too didn't have a registered IP. In our environment this typically meant something was off or a network cable was unplugged. \n\nI got to the location of where this router was located and everything on the rack looked great. They had completely redone the cable management when they installed the new rack and UPS'. At this point I was a bit worried that this might require redoing the config in the router, which was not something I was thrilled to do. As I began going through the basics of checking connections though, I noticed there was no activity indicator on the switch port where the router was connected to. I traced the cable back to the router and gave it a look over. Everything seemed fine so far and I began dreading the prospect of having to retrieve my laptop and consoling into the thing. I gave it one more once over and noticed that in the loop of power cords that had their excess neatly looped and velcro-strapped to the rack, there was one not plugged into the UPS. Breathing a sigh of relief, I plugged the cord into the UPS and the router bleeped on and whirred its own sigh of relief as it was brought back to life. \n\n*Thank goodness*, I thought to myself, as I no longer had to worry about redoing a router config. I triumphantly made my way back to my office, called the non-emergency number to let them know we would be running a few test calls, and voila! The user was able to reach 911 now and call outside of the network altogether. \n\nI took my smirk and walked into the network admin's office.\n\n>Nwadmin: Hey, what's up? You get that routing issue figured out?\n\n>Me: Sure did, luckily wasn't that difficult.\n\n>Nwadmin: Awesome, glad to hear that, you seemed to have got that done pretty quick. I know the phone issues can range from a 5 minute job to a week long project. What was the issue?\n\n(For some quick background, nwadmin handled the phone systems before I came on board and somehow managed to take it over).\n\n>Me: Well, I took a peek in that network closet, you guys and the contractors did a fantastic job up there. I did happen to notice one issue though.\n\nAt this point I think he started to realize where I was going as he started to grimace.\n\n>Nwadmin: What do you mean...?\n\n>Me: Well, you know how there's print outs plastered everywhere in our office that say \"Network admin, don't forget your phone before you leave!\" because you forget your phone at the office constantly? I think we'll need to add some to our network closets and probably the server room that say \"Nwadmin, don't forget to make sure that everything is plugged in before you leave!\". \n\n>Nwadmin just rolled his eyes as he lowered his face into his palms, letting out a defeated groan. I had a good laugh and he couldn't do anything but laugh with me for forgetting something so simple. \n\nSo for all of you greenhorns out there, the senior positions still make mistakes. You won't move up in this field at all without making mistakes yourself and learning from it, so don't fret!

I was working as a 3rd line tech support for 6 months at that time, which meant I was only called if very very serious issues appeared, but I had to be available 24\/7. We had a work phone that was passed between each technician every week. Usually, the calls are from actual clients, that have an urgent issue that we need to solve. Occasionally, a sweet, old grandma calls (the same one), that excuses herself when misstyping her grandchild\u2019s phone (or maybe just wants someone to talk to).\nOne evening, though, I received a call late in the evening:\n\nMe: Hello, tech support! What can I help you with?\n\nCaller(C): [said something I could not understand]\n\nMe: Excuse me, I did not quite understand what you said.\n\nC (a bit confused): [spoke something else, but this time I recognized the language as being Italian]\n\nMe: Sorry, I do not understand Italian, would it be possible to speak in English or get someone who can speak it?\n\nC (angry): [swears in Italian and leaves the room where she had the phone, then I can hear 2 female voices in the background]\n\nC2: Ciao (hello)\n\nMe: Ciao. Parlare Engles? [I attempt to ask if she knows English in very broken Italian]\n\nC2 doesn\u2019t answer, I hear some commotion, then she ends the call.\n\nI thought to myself: ok, that was one weird call. Guess my colleagues will have a nice story to hear tomorrow during lunch\u2026\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. I get called again. I didn\u2019t check the number to see who was calling and answered directly:\n\nMe: Hello, tech support! How ca\u2026\n\nC (angrily): F you, you a-hole! (This time in my native language, that for some reason she know I spoke) Give me back my phone!\n\nMe: That\u2019s not a nice thing to say\u2026\n\nC: You stole my phone! Give it back!\n\nMe: No, you have the wrong number, this is X tech support.\n\nC: You lying piece of \u2026 I know you\u2019re lying, give it back!\n\nMe: Insults won\u2019t make me give you my work phone\u2026 You have the wrong number.\n\nC: (another few swear words) Give me back my phone or I\u2019ll call the carabinieri (Italian police force) after you! I know where you live!\n\nMe: Ok, call them!

After my colleague had them confirm they had tried another power socket and it still didn't work we assumed the power supply was fried, which wasn't that uncommon at the time (we Europeans still paid in our national currencies).\n\nAs this was a 45min drive (and having learned from an earlier [encounter](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/wimffy\/the_day_my_boss_told_me_the_customer_cannot_print\/)) I called their office first and double-checked again what they did, if the monitor was working (it wasn't, it got it's power from the PSU), and if they REALLY had tried another power socket.

Alright, packed my stuff, grabbed a PSU and a spare motherboard and went on my way.\n\nArriving in the middle of the small town, driving halfway into the pedestrian zone the office was located at. Checked in with the front desk and began to assess the situation. First thing was getting shown which sockets they used. And they did not lie, they actually DID use another socket. But there was a catch.\n\nIt was a dual outlet.\n\nSo what they did was switching the power cable from the right socket to the left one, stil using the same outlet. I looked around, unplugged the fax machine from a nearby multiple distributor, plugged the computer in it and it worked, less than 5min after me coming through the door.\n\nThe \"hardest\" thing to do was to find a configuration where fax machine and computer could be plugged in and we figured that a desk lamp also connected to the distributor could be taken out of service until the defective outlet got fixed by their landlord.\n\nSecond hardest thing was to find a description for my work note to not rat the front desk people out to their boss as they were a bit embarrassed but able to have a good laugh about the situation.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1661931325.0},{"title":"\"I can't connect to the internet...

It was used for various things, and one of them was for the managers to review their company e-mail, etc. \n\nThe call starts by the manager stating that she isn't able to connect to anything. A quick light check shows normal lights on the gateway. The ISP Modem wasn't showing any lights at all.  \n\n\nWe used battery backups rather than generators in some of our locations. These battery backups had certain plugs on the backups that were powered by a battery and the rest of the outlets were essentially a surge protector. This will be important, later.  \n\n\nContinuing on, we attempted to resolve the issue by plugging the power of the ISP Modem into a different outlet on the battery back up. Once plugged into this other outlet, the ISP lights started to come on. As this is happening and the ISP modem is getting on, I'm attempting to ping the router to ensure that we're able to make a connection to the location. I wait about 5 minutes and we are able to make connection to the gateway, but we're not able to connect to any other device on the network.    \n\n\nWe move our attention to the office computer. It was at this point we realized that the office computer was off. We then checked the monitor, no light on the monitor, not even a standby light. We checked the computer tower, no lights. We then move our attention to the rest of the networking equipment: Network switch, in store phone system\/PA system, etc.... some devices had lights, other devices no power at all.  \n\n\nThe battery backups were only designed to hold enough power to be able to safely turn off certain devices that are attached to it, ie gateway, computer, etc. It was at this point I began explaining to the manager that I believe that they are having some sort of power issue within their office\/location. The response I had gotten from the manager was an immediate \"I know. We've been experiencing issues with our power all day within our store and I wanted to see what we could do to get our systems online while we attempt to resolve our electrical issues\" I, although infuriated, kindly explained that there's not a lot we can do in order to get they computers online and on without confirmation of proper power being provided to the devices. The manager further explained that half the location was had lights and the other half was on emergency lights. \\*facepalm\\*\n\nI'm not sure exactly how long the call lasted, but we were typically always busy, so it may have been hours that we were on the phone or just less than 30 minutes, the damage felt the same.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1661961057.0},{"title":"Why does it search near \u2018corporate office location\u2019 everytime i search for places near me?","author":"ChickenFry666","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/x223qu\/why_does_it_search_near_corporate_office_location\/","text":"This user messaged me asking why it was searching near *corporate location office* everytime she googled places near her. \nShe lives half way across country from our corporate office location.\n\nMe: are you connected to VPN or working in the office?\n\nUser: connected to VPN\n\nMe: \u201c*brief explanation on how vpn works*\u201d since our VPN is connected to our \u2018corporate office location\u2019 network, the internet thinks you are at at this location.

When I get there, the Maintenance Tech tells me that their big bay door wasn\u2019t working, and wants me to look at it. \n\nMe: Um\u2026I don\u2019t know anything about doors. \n\nMT: Well it\u2019s your department, so you need to find out how to get it working. \n\nMe: How on earth does a bay door fall under the IT umbrella?\n\nMT: It uses electricity, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nMe: So does a toaster but you don\u2019t call IT when your bread isn\u2019t browning. \n\nEventually another maintenance tech was walking by and heard our commotion. He sprung into action. Apparently the little laser sensor comes loose sometimes. \n\nAbout a week later I get called out to the line urgently because a piece of equipment isn\u2019t working. Same Maint. Tech from before. After checking it out, it appeared the programming wasn\u2019t doing what it\u2019s supposed to. I\u2019m entry level IT, I\u2019m not messing with the coding of a piece of production equipment. \n\nMe: Yeah, I\u2019ll get a hold of engineering. \n\nMT: Well that\u2019s technically your job\n\nMe: If that was my job, I\u2019d be doing it.

Other than that it\u2019s not my department. \n\nThis maintenance tech continued to call me about things that were obviously not IT, including, but not limited to: an HVAC system, the huge bay door (again) a forklift, and most recently because he received a ticket to mount TVs. When I explained to him IT only does the cable drop, Maint does the actual hardware mounting, it once again caused a curfuffle that I needed to call his boss to explain that if it was my job to mount the TV, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten the ticket for it.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1661842205.0},{"title":"You reset your password, forget it and refuse to read my message?

No joke, the actual amount of tickets\/calls regarding that topic is after 6 months still below 10.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway. Fast forward to today and ... let's call him Angry Andy or AA. Andy has a tendency to get angry. fast. Also is one hell of an early bird (6am ...) and one of the longest workers in the company. Probably around 30 years or so now. So most people just let him do his \"thing\" since he's gone in a few years anyway. Andy is also, acceptable level, capable of working with a PC. Not a \"my mouse is not plugged in. Better call IT\" - User. So we rarely have contact with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday Andy calls. He is back from vacation, changed his password and can't login into Outlook. I broke down the situation, checked briefly the latest sync (20 minutes ago) and broke down the situation, asked him nicely to be patient for a few minutes, grab a coffee or so and it will work in not even 10 minutes (no good idea in retrospective). A bit grumpy AA accepted that and I considered the topic closed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward 1 hour. AA calls, he can't login yet and it's getting a bit urgent. I'm kind of bummed why he waited a full hour and why he restarted his PC a few times (never question a user that willingly restarts. It's great). Sync looked OK, so his password which he uses on the PC to login \\*should\\* work. If he remembers it correctly. He claims of course he does type it in correctly.. so I just went with it and reset it via office admin portal and write him via a secondary chat portal we have that I did that. (Writing in teams would obviously not work since he can't login that's why I used something else to ensure he gets it) Followed by 2 line breaks. his new password. Followed by 2 line breaks. (so that you really can NOT oversee it). I even get an \"OK\" as answer.\n\nCase closed. At least I thought that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward, another phone call from AA. He is at this point really angry. Close to \"I will call my boss about this\" angry. Complaining why I don't respond anymore, he needs to work \/ send mails etc. and it's unbearable that it's still not working.\n\nMe: Does the password not work, I resetted it and had send it via chat around 1 hour ago.\n\nAA: No. There was no message. I don't know about any reset password. It needs to work. ASAP.\n\nMe -> accesses his PC remotly, chat is even still open. 5 lines of text. 3 along \"Hello, I reset the pw\" etc. followed by line breaks. The password right in the middle. followed by line breaks. Copy & paste in the password field. (It works now).\n\nAA: Hangs up. Still angry, saying something along finally it works, took long enough etc.\n\nNo \"Oh, didn't see that\", no \"Goodbye\" or a \"Thanks\". Nothing along that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's Andy ....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  The title is maybe sounding a bit misleading. At least purely by my following text since I say he restarted multiple times (which then would require his password). It's very likely he has setup a PIN, we allow that with a minimum length of 6 though. So I think he mistyped the password and was still able to use the PIN because when resetting the password, he obviously was logged in once correctly","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1661846344.0},{"title":"The flower","author":"Keysrin","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/x1e2td\/the_flower\/","text":"Ok, first of all, I joined this r\/ especially because this story needs to be told around the world (and get out of my system).

Yeah, the keyboard was manky, discolored with God-only-knows and slightly bent to boot, but that wasn't the worst thing about the terminal. A decade of burn-in had rendered the screen nearly indecipherable. \n\nSo I went to the storage closet and snagged him a newer white phosphor WY-160.\n\nA week goes by, and Mr. I-Hate-Change stops by to ask about the 'color terminal' I'd put in his area. He wanted a second one for himself. \n\nI didn't understand. We didn't have color terminals, and, even if we did, the application we used didn't do color. Bold, inverse and half-intensity, sure, even underline in some places, but not color. \n\nNo, he insisted that I'd given someone a color terminal, and that he'd show me.\n\nSo he drags me down to the plant floor, walks me over to the WY-160 I'd installed the week before, and points. \n\nAnd some of the text is in color. All the areas the operator needs to read before confirming a job are bright yellow, like they've been highlighted.\n\nIn fact, exactly like they'd been highlighted. With a highlighter.

I thought you were just coming up with the weirdest thing you could think of a user doing.  But today I learned that the stories were all true.\n\n\nIt was just a standard tower replacement in our usual refresh cycle.  I did the same thing I've done over and over already, I ran our user migration tool on the old computer, then I set up the new computer and ran the tool again to restore the files.  I made sure the user could access her emails, made sure her browser favorites showed up properly, got her printer installed, and then I was on my way.\n\n\nBy the time I got back to my desk I was getting messages from her demanding that I bring the old computer back because all of her files were gone!  While I'm loading up her old HDD I tell her that sometimes the user migration misses files that were in non-standard locations and ask where the files were located so I can retrieve them for her.  She says she's missing hundreds of files and they were all on the desktop.  Now, I saw her desktop earlier and I know there weren't hundreds of files there (thankfully!) so I figured they were in a folder.  \n\n\nAnd that's when memories of this subreddit flooded back to me and I decided to look in the recycle bin.  Sure enough, there are hundreds of files there, so I take a screenshot and ask her if these are the missing files.  Of course they are, that's obviously where you want to keep your important files so you can reuse them!\n\n\nSo now I get the joy of trying to explain why it's a bad idea to store files in the recycle bin.  Maybe if I'm really lucky I can convince her to actually use our cloud storage, but I won't hold my breath.\n\n\nEdit: So I explained to her that the recycle bin was meant for deleted files (true) and that several times in the past the company had discussed setting up a policy that would automatically empty the recycle bin every week (a lie).  That, combined with the scare of all her files being missing, seemed to drive home how precarious it was to keep files there.  I moved her files to cloud storage and set up a shortcut to it right next to the recycle bin and named it \"Files to Reuse\" in the hopes that she will get in the habit of using that instead.  Luckily she put files in the recycle bin by dragging them, not by using the delete key, so I don't have to worry about that at least.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1661542936.0},{"title":"Flew over 10,000 km to fix a problem in seconds","author":"Mindless-Charity4889","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/wy6m36\/flew_over_10000_km_to_fix_a_problem_in_seconds\/","text":"Way back in the late '90s I worked as a software developer for a tech company in the Pacific North West that produced portable data logging devices. These were battery operated, self contained units that monitored things like temperature, humidity etc. One of our product lines was certified \"Intrinsically Safe\", as it was completely encapsulated in silicone and had no electric ports. Instead, it had an optical port and you could communicate via light wand. The unit was popular as it's construction essentially made it waterproof.\n\nWe sold these units all over the world and one of our clients was a refrigerator manufacturer in a South American country. They would put the unit in the freezer compartment of a fridge on the production line as it ran through a test freeze and defrost cycle. Then they would retrieve the information at the end of the production line to verify that the fridge was working within specification.\n\nNormally, downloading the information would take seconds but on occasion, the device would have trouble communicating and would take several minutes to download the data. This was a problem since it slowed down the entire production line.\n\nOur tech support guys were unable to help the customer; we could not reproduce the problem here. The issue was passed to us in development, both hardware and software, but we could not duplicate it either. So the client offered to fly an engineer to their location and put them up for a week. Our company asked for volunteers and I decided to go.\n\nIt was a very long flight but I arrived at a surprisingly clean and modern airport and was put up in a 4 star hotel. I was assigned a driver and an interpreter.\n\nThe next day, I was driven to the client's plant. After passing through security, I was shown the station where the devices were downloaded. And that's where I spotted the problem.\n\nRemember, the units had no electrical ports and only communicated through an LED for both transmission and reception. The company was removing the units from the freezers and putting them on a table, right underneath a large fluorescent fixture that was only 2 feet above. I immediately realized that the light fixture, which would have been flickering at 50hz, was tricking the occasional unit into communicating. Once it goes into the communication cycle, then plugging in the light wand simply confused it until it had a chance to reset a couple of minutes later.\n\nSo I told them to turn the devices face down on the table. That prevented the light from triggering them.\n\nI also reported my findings back home and we worked out a new firmware protocol to eliminate the problem in newer devices, but simply placing them face down until it was time to plug in the light wand solved the issue.\n\nI spent the next few days touring the city and buying souvenirs. The client also paid for a really nice meal at an Argentinian style meat house. I could have stayed the whole week but I wanted to get back so they exchanged my ticket and sent me home after 4 days.\n\nThe thing is, we would never have thought of this back home. Sometimes you really have to be on site to figure things out.\n\nPS. While I was there, they mentioned another issue. Employees were occasionally stealing the units. Apparently they liked using the magnetic backed devices as fridge magnets, especially since the flashing LED indicating a full device looked cool. They asked how much it would cost to install RFID trackers or even cell phone trackers into the units to reduce theft. I simply told them to remove the magnets (they weren't using them anyway) and to turn off the LED blinking via a software command. After that, I don't think any more were stolen.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1661513003.0},{"title":"Unexplainable crashes","author":"uneducatedrascal","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/wy3zfh\/unexplainable_crashes\/","text":"Hi there,  \n\n\nThe following post reminded me of a story I don't have very fond memories of..  \n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/wso8vc\/my\\_new\\_headset\\_crashes\\_my\\_computer\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/talesfromtechsupport\/comments\/wso8vc\/my_new_headset_crashes_my_computer\/)  \nAlso excuse my english since it's not my native language.\n\nThis was some years ago, back when Windows 10 was fresh.\n\nI had a customer who had shop, only ran by her, so there wasn't much IT, only a Laptop, Printer and an external HDD for Backups.\n\nIt was time for her to upgrade her Laptop which she worked with because it was getting old so she bought a new one from us, alongside a new external HDD for Backups.\n\nSetup her System, configured and installed everything including Backup Software (We've used Acronis back then), made an initial backup.

We are also the ones managing it and preparing install\/upgrade steps that need to be done from time to time.\n\nA different department developed a custom web interface to this ticketing system some years ago. Recently, a new team was tasked with performing some small improvements and upgrading this web interface, since it was using old dependencies (the team which originally built it is no longer here).\n\nThis led to a lot of communication with our department, which prepared and configured a ticketing instance for them to use in their development environment. They detected some errors, we fixed them and deployed the updated version, they discovered other failures, etc.\n\nThey were mostly small errors on our part, such a needed configuration setting missing, but at one point they also found an important bug in an interface. Their code also had some issues. For instance, it turns out that the test cases created by the previous team had hardcoded values such as the ticket ids or the expected creation time. Which of course failed on a new instance.\n\nThen, one day they reported us that the ticketing system returned a weird error trying to close a ticket, and it wasn't even showing who had opened the ticket.\n\nThis was concerning, we had never seen that kind of error and a bit of diving into the code of the ticketing system suggested that that the application was deeply confused.\n\nWe inquired how they created those broken tickets, but we were told they were all created like the last time, with a (provided) curl call to the ticket creation on their web interface (which in turn would call the ticketing system API). After some work to configure it on our side... the ticket created by us did not show the same symptoms.\n\nThey quickly agreed that one seemed correct, and suggested to delete all tickets and start again. This was peculiar, since it was usually *us* who preferred to start fresh (we had been through a number of cycles already). The install was automated, so it was very cheap for us to perform a clean deploy, but they would need to perform some manual tweaking afterwards.\n\nIn this case, however, we wanted to know *why* it broke, so that we didn't end up with broken tickets in production. Luckily, the reason was evident when inspecting the database contents and finding out a gap in the incremental ids of the tickets just before the broken ones (which also had an older timestamp than the previous ones). It was a relief to discover that the code was fine, and it only broke because someone did an `UPDATE` in the database to the id column to make them match those in the functional tests. The ticketing system doesn't use `FOREIGN KEY`s, even though there were other tables referencing the old ids they had modified... which they hadn't updated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: a development team directly edits the database of another application changing the ids in one table.

The vendor basically told me that most customers just bought at least two and mirrored them, however that was beyond my budget by a country mile.  So instead I mounted the file server shares on my backup server via NFS and backed it up that way.  Not ideal at all but it seemed to work.  Backups kicked off in the evening and completed early in the morning.  The backup software generated a report and emailed it to so every morning I knew the backups had run.\n\nAnd one day when I came in, I had no email indicating the backups had run.  So, I ssh to the backup server, hum, backups still running.  Drill down a little, its working on the file server (no surprise, its by far got the largest volumes).   I check the file system sizes, did someone create a zillion files or something?  No, sizes are comparable to the day before, and we do enforce quotas on the students for disk usage.\n\nSo, what is causing this?  The system load on the backup server is tiny, its barely working.  Then I think, maybe the network?  I had MRTG running so I look at the graphs for the file server, traffic is pegged high.  I look back a few days and traffic is way lower.  Drill down a bit, traffic increased hugely the day before.  WTF.   I'm thinking maybe one of my Linux clients has gone crazy and is generating a bunch of network errors or something, so I start looking at the MRTG data for my various Linux boxes.
