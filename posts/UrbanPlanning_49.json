I am particularly interested in comparing the land use patterns and types of places created when these systems are installed. It would be great to know if redevelopment favors one system over the other. Based on the BRT literature that I was able to find, there is a high level of reinvestment resulting from implementing both LRT and BRT systems but I haven't been able to find a paper comparing the two systems. \n\nMy initial feeling is that LRT systems would be a larger draw to developers than BRT systems since LRT infrastructure is more permanent and rail is more attractive to users since it is often more comfortable. \n\nAny insight on this topic would be appreciated. \n\nThanks!",

But she constantly brings up the objection of \"safety\". Try as I might to deconstruct what her underlying objection is, she always comes back with \"I just want to feel safe. You know, not be worried I'm going to die when I leave the house.\" \n\nI try to introduce studies that show that she may of been led to believe they are unsafe due to segregation and redlining programs. She always rebounds on this emotional based argument though that you can't argue. \n\nHas anyone else had this conversation and found a way to reach a middle ground?\n\nFor what it's worth, she's white and I'm Hispanic and I was born and raised in NYC (Queens)\n\n**EDIT**:\n\nThanks for all the helpful info everyone. Some of the things I will be doing moving forward:\n\n* Understanding this is not necessarily a malicious double-talk for racial bias but a genuine fear of the unknown\n* Trying to get a diverse exposure to multiple different types of cities and cultures - even some outside the US. (Thinking of doing Spain).\n* Finding or founding community enrichment projects like inner city farming start ups and restaurant incubators\n* Negotiating a balance between the two (street-car suburbs).\n* **Toning down my patriarchy.** (Thanks guys)\n* Just giving it time and encouraging a positive feedback loop.",

Specifically, I would like to work in transportation consulting, mostly doing traffic demand modeling forecasts, traffic engineering and network analyses. I really want to break into this field but I have no practical experience in using traffic engineering and modeling software (and no theoretical background on this either).\n\n\nI currently already work in a transportation consulting firm which gets me one step closer, but I only do economics work (cost-benefit analyses for new transportation infrastructure investments, basically). The work that I would like to be doing is mostly done by my engineering colleagues (and some geographers), and I haven’t been able to make the jump to their department because I do not have the skills.\n\n\nIn your opinion, should I go back to school and get another masters in transportation planning/GIS, in order to get a better theoretical background? Should I just take some practical training courses on these software tools? Or will I be able to find a job in transport planning with my economics background, and learn all these tools on-the-job?\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

        "text": "Fences have an extraordinary impact on urban environments.\n\nIn our age of concerns about crime, gated communities (fenced communities) are becoming ever more common.  And in many low income communities like  east L.A.,  fenced lots are the norm.\n\nCome home, get out of your car, open the gate, drive in and park, close gate and enter house.  Or, if you can afford it, an automatic gate.  In both rich and poor communities, fences are prized by many.\n\nThere are a few exceptions.  I used to live in southern Marin County, north of S.F., where fences were virtually non existent, aside from around playing fields at schools. (Homes are mostly open to the streets, fences primarily around backyards). And in Mill Vally and adjacent Sausalito, major parts of these two towns' steep slopes contain *steps, lanes and paths* that allow people to pass between homes.  Even in flatter areas like Corte Madera these paths are common.\n\nSomeone could peer in peoples' windows.  Hop a homeowner's back fence.  Burglarize a home.  But in these affluent communities, people accept these risks for the benefits.\n\nhttps://stairwayfreedom.weebly.com/mill-valley--sausalito\n\nhttp://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20170301/NEWS/170309981\n\nI gather that paths between homes--a feature of many communities for hundreds of years--are growing rare in America.  Most homeowners seem to value privacy and ubiquitous fencing.  This fact became more evident when I recently visited relatives in a condo complex south of Seattle.\n\nIn my previous visits in the 2000s, I enjoyed rising and walking to a nearby Starbuck and the adjacent mall.  Exit the condo, walk through a 7-11 parking lot and head for coffee.  3 minute walk.\n\nOn this visit:  Surprise.  7-11 put a fence around its lot.  So did all adjacent businesses.  Linked fences; no gates. And the 120-unit condo complex also turned gated, encircling itself with a fence.\n\nSo 2 sets of fencing.  No more walking to Starbucks and mall less than 100 yards away.  Or the bus stop fronting the mall.  The new route--if one can call it that--a 1/4 mile walk in other direction to the community exit.  Then, a 3/4 mile circuitous walk back to the mall area.  On a high speed road with no sidewalks.  Walking in muddy brush.  Not feasible.\n\nSo in the household of 5 adults and only 2 cars, if both cars are being used, now you are essentially stuck home (excepting a circular community walk).  \n\nWhat a significant turn of events for the homeowners.  Can one assign a monetary value to a home having access to a nearby store? Or bus stop?  *When the home is physically located near those amenities??*\n\nMy sense from my travels across the U.S. is this is becoming more common across the nation.  More fencing.  More gated communities.\n\nViewpoints on this urban planning issue?\n\n\n\n\n\n ",
