I am a student technician working for a college and today a faculty member requested we retrieve a book he wrote from a floppy disk. Most of this technology was created before I was born so it felt a lot like trying to work with a typewriter. I retrieved a floppy disk drive that someone had almost thrown out a couple weeks prior and got to work copying WPD files onto a 4 GB flash drive (just under 4000x more than the space necessary) when it encountered an error writing to the drive. Knowing how often this means a file just can’t be written properly I prepared for the worst and assumed I would run into this issue for every file. For kicks I decided to “Try Again” expecting the worst and it just worked... I was honestly stunned. Since when was the “Try Again” button in Windows anything but cosmetic? I almost still can’t believe what I just saw. Fun side note it was weird to see last modified dates that started before and ended after the day I was born. That’s all, not too exciting but for some reason I was giddy after experiencing all of this.",

Everything is going as normal as I start replacing the last user’s workstation. As I am removing the old machine and unplugging everything from the station I noticed a USB extender cable but didn’t think much of it initially because some desks we have aren’t the most cable management friendly and a mouse or keyboard may need it to properly reach the computer. I then notice that the user only has a single usb keyboard with a wireless mouse, which made me question the extender that I had seen earlier. I was curious what it was being used for seeing as there is nothing else the user has that would require a usb connection. As I followed the cable that I had plugged back into the new workstation I find it just laying there. I picked it up and what do I see? The wireless dongle to their wireless mouse plugged into the other end. \n\nI couldn’t help but just laugh and wonder who had offered the user the cable in the first place since I have only been here for about 2 years and rarely visit the specific branch. I quickly removed the cable and plugged the dongle into the workstation without mentioning anything to the user and finished the set up. ",

I for example, as a L1 printer tech, expect my tickets to be vaguely worded, expect tickets that aren't in your scope but were given to you because they involve the printer, and expect every other user to make a remark about getting a new printer or pushing it down the stairs.\n\nWhat you don't expect, is this same sort of thing from your coworkers, especially when do they same thing you do and have had the same training. Now I should preamble this with the fact that we are encouraged to help each other out when possible, like when we need to borrow a part, or forgot a little used process, but I should also preamble this with the fact that the man asking this question is the man who trained me when I started working for this company, and the question is outside both our scopes.\n\nHis email reads:\n\n&gt;Hi [Meat_Robot] can you send me the Microsoft Exchange Server? Thank you\n\nI was working on a machine when I received this, which I remember because my brain had a difficult time shifting gears to process what he just sent me. Send you the server? Sure, I'll call up M$ and have them put it on a truck for you.\n\nI reply:\n\n&gt;No? I'm not sure what you're asking for. Have you contacted $OurCompany IT about this?\n\nI go back to purging paper jams thinking that will be the end of that, but he then calls me.\n\n&gt; $MR: \"Hello?\"\n\n&gt;$CW: \"Hi Meat_Robot, when you hit the top of the mail app and it shows the Exchange Server. Can you send that to me?\"\n\nI open my mail app and see nothing like that in the menu options.\n\n&gt;$MR: \"I don't see it. Are you using $App?\"\n\n&gt;$CW: \"No I'm using $OldAppBeingPhasedOut.\"\n\n&gt;$MR: \"Ok, I don't have $OldApp, and I'm with a customer besides. You're going to need to call $OurCompany IT.\"\n\n&gt;$CW: [annoyed] \"Alright, yeah. Fine...\" \\*click\\*\n\nI thumbed my phone off feeling bewildered, befuddled, and blindsided. It bears repeating, I was trained by this person. He has been at the company for many years. Besides IT, He had four different managers to call and a whole list of people who had been working there longer than a few months. Why he called me, I couldn't fathom.\n\nThe whole incident caused me to doubt everything I thought I knew about tech support. If we aren't safe from dumb user problems with our fellow support techs, are we ever safe at all?",

        "text": "Greetings TFTS! Long time reader/lurker, first time poster, all that jazz. I’ve relatively new to the IT world, just under a full year of professional experience under my belt. I’m currently a Tier 1 nose grinder/queue monkey for an agency with multiple tech departments (server team, programming team, data security team, etc.), but I’ve been doing tech support like things for close to a decade between family, and past jobs figuring out that I’m a “computer guy” (you all know how that goes). Turns out I had a knack for problem solving, following directions, and having enough patience to deal with your typical user (I’d like to thank my family for being perfect examples of what to expect).  \n\nToday’s tale is a story about one of those users who complain that we don’t help them, only to discover they’re making it very difficult to do exactly that.\n\n\nThe Cast: \n\n**$Me** = yours truly\n\n**$OL** = Older Lady who works for one of the many departments we provide support for\n\n\n\n**$Me**: Good morning, this is [place where I work]’s Technical Support Desk, how can I help you this morning?\n\n\n\n**$OL**: I’d like an update on this ticket!\n\n\n**$Me**: I’d be happy to give you the latest status, could I please have the ticket number in question?\n\n\n\n**$OL**: [Rattles off ticket number]\n\n\n\n**$Me**: Alright, I see this is a ticket with an error in a report that was generated?\n\n\n**$OL**: That’s right! I sent this ticket in a week ago, and nothing has been done on it. \n\n\n**$Me**: Hmm, that’s odd. I have an email that was sent to you via our ticketing system an hour after you submitted the ticket. It’s requesting the URL for the report that you’re seeing this error in? \n\n\n**$OL**: I never received an email from anyone. \n\nIt is at this point I pause, and take stock of the situation. Our ticketing system clearly shows an email going to what I have as this user’s email address, along with a date and time sent. I decide I want to check things out, catch her in her lie (if she is lying) or fix a problem with her email she hasn’t reported yet. At the same time, I can probably get the information the technician was asking for last week. \n\n\n**$Me**: Well it’s very odd you never received an email, could I get your computer name?  I’d like to make sure your receiving emails properly. \n\n\n**$OL**: My computer’s name is [Gives me the computer’s Asset tag]\n\n\nInternal grumbling… The asset tag isn’t the computer name, but I can find the computer name from it. It just takes a little more time. It also helps me know exactly what level of tech savviness the user is.\n\n\n**$Me**: Ok, You should see your screen flash once or twice as I remote in… Ok, I’m in. May I have control for a moment?\n\n\n**$OL**: Sure!\nI disable the user’s input capabilities, and navigate to their email. I scroll to the date and time I have from our ticket that this email was sent to them. Sure enough I find the email and it’s been marked as read, so they definitely saw it or at least browsed passed it. \n\n\n**$Me**: Alright, so I found the email that the technician sent to you, do you remember this by any chance?\n\n\n**$OL**: Oh yeah! But I didn’t know what a “URL” is, so I ignored it. \n\n\nI am internally banging my head on the desk at this point, and I don’t blame the technician for ignoring the user if the user is going to ignore them first….\n\n\n**$Me**: Ok, well let’s try and solve that little problem to then. Can you show me the report that you’re having issues with?\n\n\nI give her control of the computer back, and she navigates to another email she has received. It has a PDF attachment, a short, one sentence description in the body of the email, with a notice immediately below that. It says “To access this report directly, please use this URL: [insert URL here].” I only get a brief look at this as she immediately opens the PDF attachment, barely looking at the rest of the email. \n\n\n**$OL**: Here’s the report. The issue is with this particular data entry here. (She points to something in the report. The data entry doesn't look different from any of the others so I assume it's something to do with it's value.) \n\n\n**$Me**: Well I can’t immediately assist you myself with this, as I don’t have access to the web app that generates this report. (I disable her input capabilities again.) However (I minimize the PDF, and pull the email back up), this right here is the URL that technician was asking for. See how it says “To access this report directly, please use this URL: [insert URL here].” That’s what they need. May I forward this information to the technician?\n\n\n**$OL**: Oh! Really? That’s the URL? Well if it’ll get them to resolve this, then sure. Why hasn’t it been done yet!?!\n\n\n**$Me**: Well, how about I follow-up with the tech myself to make sure they got this. They should be able to get started with this. Have a good day $OL. *hangs up*\n\n\nTL:DR – $OL asks why ticket isn’t being worked on. Turns out it’s because she decided to ignore her technician, and because she doesn’t really know how these reports she works on are generated…\n",

        "text": "FTLT, etc. I'm primarily a software developer, but our engineering department is also our IT department, and as such when $Boss is out all of the IT calls go to me. So begins our descent into the madness of teaching internet security to the technically illiterate.\n\nOur story begins on the second day of $Boss's business trip to Important Client™. I get a frantic email from $SecurityRisk (one of our operators) yelling about her email being hacked. I book it over to her cubical to get the full scoop: around a dozen clients have sent her an email complaining about receiving phishing emails from her address. I immediately check her outbox and see nothing of the sort has been recorded.\n\nUnderstanding that this doesn't rule out the possibility of a breach, I immediately suspend access to her account and ping $Boss to grant me access to the remote email server. Checking the server logs, I see absolutely no sign of intrusion or evidence of the phishing emails leaving our server. Huh, this is very suspicious. This means that either the culprit has complete admin control of the box (incredibly unlikely, given that the rest of our system doesn't appear compromised) or that the emails have been somehow spoofed. Suspecting the latter, I take a closer look at the headers of one of the phishing emails, which has been forwarded to us by a cooperative client. Apparently the phisher had been masquerading as $SecurityRisk by spoofing the \"From\" field, which includes both a human-readable name and the email address. Applications like gmail show just the name to users, which is what caused the alarm: apparently the phisher had just been using her name, but the email address was clearly from some throw-away hotmail account.\n\nAfter sending out an email to everyone@$MyCompany and our clients making them aware of the phishing attempt and (internally) good email practices in general, I had hoped to get back to my work. Alas, $SecurityRisk sends another frantic email a few minutes later complaining that \"a hacker was still in her account and sending emails, with proof!\" Okay, I need to nip this one in the bud, so I wrap up what I'm doing and go over to see what she's complaining about.\n\nAt her desk, I ask her to show me the \"hacked\" emails, and see exactly the same culprit using exactly the same phishing scam I described in the email. However, this time he decided to send an email directly to her, using \"her own\" email account. This email body contained an (admittedly real looking) link to a drop-box account that was clearly another phishing attempt. After telling her to just delete and ignore it, she responded by saying \"but what should I do with the drop-box window?\" I spin around and see that she had clicked the dangerous link, 5 minutes after receiving an email where I **explicitly** informed everyone **not to click suspicious links in emails** and seconds after I told her **in person** not to click it! I confiscated her computer and sent her to her manager. We wiped the computer.\n\nNeedless to say, the situation was resolved when absolutely nothing changed, she was issued a new (much better) computer, and continued complaining about \"spammy emails\" for the rest of the week.\n\n**tl;dr:** User \"gets email hacked,\" which is just a clever phishing attempt, is told that it's a scam and to avoid clicking links from the scammer, clicks the link anyway, no discipline received whatsoever.\n\n-edit: You guys more than ~~tripled~~ nonupled my post karma &lt;3 Thanks to a wonderful community!\n\n-edit2: Wow this blew up. For those asking why we wiped her computer: just an abundance of caution. The phisher somehow managed to get her address book (we cross-referenced the clients we heard from with her address book and others) so she had at the very least been compromised before we changed all of her credentials. Not knowing how she was compromised (probably a session cookie, but you never know), we decided the safest route was to do a full wipe.",

She's the \"*sigh* let me google that for you\" person of us both, and my source of help and information whenever my parents come up with a new Win10 question.\n\nNow she finally could replace her dying laptop with a nice gaming rig, and of course she got all the components and built it herself. All I did was inserting the graphics card, and the cable management - to an extent where I really was in danger of being hit by a flying object, if I had said \"cable management\" one more time. \n\nThe time came to fire it up, everything worked fine apart from the horrible screen resolution that comes with a freshly set up system... and the second screen that said \"no input\". This second screen is an older one that served on her laptop previously. By now you all know what happened next...\nAfter a short minute of troubleshooting something clicked inside of my head:\n\n&gt;Me: \"What kind of connector does it have?\"\n&gt;Her: \"VGA...\"\n&gt;Me: \"... Does your mainboard still have a VGA port?\"\n&gt;Her: *facepalm* \"Yes... No wonder that it didn't work\"\n\nAfter confirming that the screen had a DVI port, rummaging through my cable collection, and handing her a fitting cable, everything worked perfectly, and we got a good laugh out of it.\n\ntl;dr: PCIe graphics card overrides the onboard graphic where the second screen was connected.

Today, there's one more thing I can cross of that list. \n\nI answer a call and the problem is something like this. \n\n&gt; **Her**: I need to send some files via your website and they have to be out today, but it can't find them. \n\nI quickly check some of the most common causes, but find no problems yet. \n\n&gt; **Me**: The files have to be in a certain folder so that the app on our website can find them. Can you go to 'My computer' and go to *C:\\some\\folder*?\n\n&gt; **Her**: I think I know what folder you're talking about, it's C, some, folder, archive...\n\n&gt; **Me**: Not in archive, just *\\some\\folder*. \n\n&gt; **Her**: No, the files aren't in there. \n\n&gt; **Me**: What sometimes happens is that the files are accidentally saved in a different folder. Could you maybe check your downloads folder? \n\n&gt; **Her**: There is no downloads folder here? \n\n&gt; **Me**: You can usually find it in the left part of your screen, somewhere near the top of that list. \n\n&gt;**Her**: Nope, can't find it...\n\nI ask her to start up teamviewer, otherwise this is going to take all day. There's no way I can know where they might have saved these files, but I go through some folders anyway. I find nothing. \n\n&gt; **Me**: I can't know where you might have saved these files, I'm just guessing here, but I can't find them. It's probably easier if you create them again, it shouldn't be too much work. \n\n&gt; **Her**: But I'm sure my coworker created those files.\n\n&gt; **Me**: Wait, your coworker? Did she create them on her computer? \n\n&gt; **Her**: Yes.\n\n&gt; **Me**: Then the files are on her computer?\n\n&gt; **Her**: Do you maybe want to call her, so that you can send them from her computer? \n\nYes, I would very much like that.Coworker (CW) doesn't even work in the same building. I ring her up, and it just gets worse. \n\n&gt; **Me**: Those files are on your computer, so we''ll send them from your computer. \n\n&gt; **CW**: That's not true, my coworkers have access to that too. \n\n&gt; **Me**: After you've sent them, yes, they can see what you've sent, but for now these files are only on your computer. \n\n&gt; **CW**: No, my coworkers can see those too. And I can't sent them from here because I'm having problems with Java and I can't install it without the admin password of our IT-guy who isn't here today. \n\nSide-note: that website does use Java and there was a very recent update that I assumed might not have been installed yet. And before you ask, yes, I know, and no, I can't help it. \n\n&gt; **Me**: If you want or have to send those files from a different computer, you first have to make sure they're on the computer you want to sent them from. \n\n&gt; **CW**: My coworkers have always been able to see them too!\n\nI'm just baffled by how stubborn she is. I saw her coworkers computer, there weren't any shared folders, cloud services or anything similar installed, I know the files are stored on a local drive. \n\n&gt; **CW**: And all it says here is \"Do you want to run this application?\" and then \"Run\" or \"Cancel\". \n\n&gt; **Me**: Have you tried clicking \"Run\"? \n\n&gt; **CW**: No... I think it works now. \n\nEdit: a few typos. ",

About a year ago, I was developing an application to manage dossiers with licenses etc. It involved cad drawings, and a system that sent out mails to project leaders so that they could approve/disapprove these cad drawings with a comment.\n\nAt the time the cad department wanted to be able to upload .DWG files as well as the \"to be approved revisions\". So that the project leaders could directly download those files after they approved the revision.\n\n~~I say 'wanted to be able' but it was more like they demanded it to be implemented yesterday and basically hounded me untill it was deployed.~~\n\nA year later I'm developing an extra feature for the comments, so that an attachment can be added to them... \n\n#...and I notice that the .DWG files' download button doesn't work.\n\nAfter staring at my code with a puzzled face for a few minutes, I realise that\n\n1. It's the url for the revision on every link that should be a .DWG file\n\n2. The url is an outdated format and wouldn't work anymore anyways\n\nSo these people that demanded this \"absolutely vital feature\" had a completely unusable set of download buttons that nobody complained about, or even noticed, for over a year.\n____________________________\n\nThx for reading.\n\nI'm off to implement some more \"absolutely vital features\". **sigh**",

A new residential customer set up an appointment for a corrupt windows user profile and I headed out at the appointment time.\n\nNice older gentlemen, no red flags, very polite.  Fix the profile issue but we are still having some strange problems with his old user account, new user accounts work great so we go about setting up a new user account and transferring all his data from the old one.\n\nDuring the fix he starts complaining about the password system that his grandson had set up for him after he fell victim to an e-mail scam on his @rocketmail.com (blast from the past) account.  He claimed he hadn't been able to get into any of his accounts besides email for over a month and wanted to know why he had to have a new password every time he wanted to use his websites.\n\nThis is when he opens his file cabinet and pulls out a massive stack of papers.  I start to flip through them and notice that its a huge pile of two-factor authentication email codes for his various accounts.  Turns out his grandson had set him up with a LastPass account and turned on two-factor email authentication, but didn't explain how it worked.  He would get to the point where it was asking for his emailed codes, print out the e-mail and then click the bookmark for the website he was trying to logon to and use that authentication code as his password.  When it inevitably failed he would repeat the process.\n\nThere had to be at least a hundred pages printed out, he was overjoyed when I showed him how to use the password management software properly and explained to him what two-factor authentication was.

        "text": "Afternoon all! LTL, FTP, and all that jazz. The post by /u/abschatten reminded me of one that happened to me once. It was a simple fix but I was pretty proud of myself for getting it working under the circumstances.\n\nMy first job out of college was at a small business we'll call ABCDirect. It had 16 employees, and we did print and mail marketing work for other companies. We didn't have enough IT work for a full time Sysadmin, so there were three IT members who did any infrastructure and helpdesk work as needed, but mostly did data processing for the mail jobs. We were client-facing, and it wasn't unusual for me to talk to a couple of the clients every day if there were issues or just vagueness about some of the data they sent over. But all the IT work was strictly internal - support of other employees' workstations, the couple servers we had, etc.\n\nSo one day, my phone rings. The HR/Accounting person had been hiring new assistants at a rate that had become almost comical... like, she'd been going through them almost as fast as *Murphy Brown* went through them on TV. HR/Accounting person is one of my best friends to this day so I don't think she was the problem, it was just this neverending parade of losers that we got from this staffing agency that we couldn't just get rid of for reasons that nobody could ever properly explain to me. The latest had arrived about 2 weeks earlier and was now answering the main phone line if it rang.\n\nOur players are:\n\n* **$Me**: I'll give you three guesses, and the first two don't count.\n* **$A**: The assistant on the main phone line\n* **$CBNO**: A customer... but just not *our* customer\n\n&gt; $Me: Hi, $A, what's up?\n\n&gt; $A: Hi! I have a customer on the line. He bought one of our products at $Retailer and needs tech support's help setting it up.\n\n&gt; $Me: Wait, what? It doesn't really work like that. ABCDirect doesn't make or sell any retail produ...\n\nThere is a helpful beep to tell me that she hung up before I could even start my sentence, and that I am now on the line with this... uh... Customer, I suppose.\n\n&gt; $Me: Uh... ABCDirect, this is $Me.\n\n&gt; $CBNO: Hi. I just bought a KT-2500XL from your company. I got it back to my store and hooked it up and I'm not getting any audio from the outputs on the back when I hook it up to the existing speaker system.\n\nI'm flabbergasted. I stand up and look over my cubicle wall. I am responsible for supporting the technology for 16 people and *I can see all of them with my eyeballs right now*. This guy is not among them.\n\nWell, it seems pretty obvious that this is a wrong number but I didn't want to just say that and hang up, because I wanted to take the opportunity to find out where he got the number from. If it's a misdial, so be it, but if another company has accidentally printed our number somewhere, I wanted to be able to get out ahead of it.\n\n&gt; $Me: Sorry, what did you say that model number was again?\n\n&gt; $CBNO: KT-2500XL\n\nI type the model number into Google real quick and discover what happened quickly enough. Apparently in addition to ABCDirect, there is also a company called ABCSolutions. ABCSolutions has been in business for a lot longer than ABCDirect, and is known for manufacturing Muzak solutions for retail stores, elevators, that sort of thing. I chuckled to myself, though, because that means that $CBNO did a Google search, found our page (which looked like a page that had been made 15 years ago in 1997, because it *had*), clicked through three layers of pages of stock photos with people happily standing next to large digital presses and showing off beautiful printed mail deliverables to get to the contact us page, and then called our number.\n\nNo problem here, time to send him on his way.\n\n&gt; $Me: I see. Well, I think you've got the wrong number. I think you're looking for ABCSolutions. You've reached ABCDirect, a print and mail shop located in $Region.\n\n&gt; $CBNO: Oh, geez, sorry about that!\n\n&gt; $Me: No problem. I've got their site pulled up here, let me get you the correct phone number before you go. It's 555...\n\nI'm about to give him the number but then I had a thought. Not a complex thought, not a hard one, not one born of any expertise or knowledge about the product at all. Just one that I know, based on my career so far, is a good one to ask.\n\n&gt; $Me: Hey, wait a second. Random question. After you plugged the speakers into the back of the thing you bought today... have you tried turning it off and on again?\n\n&gt; $CBNO: Uh, no, I guess I didn't. Hang on a sec... Oh, hey, cool, you fixed it!\n\n&gt; $Me: Happy to help sir! Have a great day.\n\nAnd with that I went off to find HR/Accounting and tell her it was probably time to start searching for yet another assistant. Preferably one who at least understood what ABCDirect actually *did* this time.",

Let’s see if it works! \n\nWell. It didn’t. While they wrapped up, I used two minutes in my own outlook looking for the setting I just couldn’t remember the location of. Five minutes later... \n\n- I found it! See, does this not replicate (and solve) your issue? \n\nIt did. She took a screen shot and sent it back to the poor (and very new) tech support. \n\nI feel for them. We’ve contracted a new company a few months ago, so I assume most of them are pretty new. I fully understand her goto solution as it resolves almost all issues with outlook. But apparently, the visualisation setting within a meeting booking is kept even when the profile is deleted and readded. So that apparently follows the software installation and not the account (which does not explain why it also replicates itself on the webmail... but that’s an issue for someone who knows a lot more than me - like you guys!)\n\n\nTLDR; profile reinstall solves everything! - or how you learn that some settings follow the software and not the account.",

My very first computer related job, I was hired through college to work over the summer deploying ~500 *new* windows XP computers to replace the old machines at a local hospital (and its assorted branches), normally windows 95 and windows 98.  Yes.  This job was exactly as easy as it sounds.\n\nOne particular tale from this time stands out from the others.\n\nPlayers:\n\n$Wrath: Me from 10 years ago!\n\n$Anime: A ‘not quite’ tech friend who happens to be the boss’s daughter. \n\n$Nurse: A nurse working at the hospital.\n\n$Anime and I were tasked to do some reconnaissance and start replacing every computer we find as quickly as we can in some back corner of (at the time) a less used wing of the hospital.  We loaded up a cart with a dozen machines, monitors and other supplies before heading out.  I got to pull the cart, $Anime ‘helped.’\n\nThe area we are working in today is low traffic, most of the lights are off to save power, or maybe just because the nurses didn’t like the angry florescent glow and buzzing that permeated the air.\n\nA few hours pass without incident, a few nurses occasionally pass us by and stare longingly at the remaining new flat screen monitors on our cart before wandering back to their desks or offices with temperamental (and heavy!) CRT monitors that could probably crush someone who wasn’t paying enough attention.\n\n&gt; **$Anime:** Hey $Wrath.. Do you have that room on the list?\n\nI take the opportunity to stop hauling around over a half dozen CRT’s and towers and check the list.  Nothing.  The office number is faded on the old wooden, but still readable.  Unfortunately it doesn’t look like its even on the hospitals room map much less our list.\n\n&gt; **$Wrath:** No.. its not on here at all.\n\n$Anime and I share a look that belongs to those with the survival instincts of characters in Scooby Doo.\n\n&gt; **$Anime:** lets check it out.\n\nWe tried the door.  Locked.  Curses!  Foiled again!\n\n&gt; **$Wrath:** There was a nurses station down the hall, ill keep watch on the cart you check and see if they have a key.\n\nThere were still a few new monitors and machines on the cart loaded up in front of approximately a million pounds of CRTs so one of us needed to have line of sight on them at all times less they wander off under the watchful gazes of the nurses.  And I wasn’t going to drag it back and forth down the hall any more than was necessary.\n\n**Neither $Wrath nor $Anime were eaten and replaced by any eldritch abomination after they split the party.**\n\n&gt; **$Nurse as she is walking with $Anime:** I don’t think ive ever seen inside that room.  Its supposed to be reserved as an office for visiting doctors.  Why do you need in there again?\n\n&gt; **$Anime:** Just checking for old computers to replace.\n\n&gt; **$Nurse’s eyes light up:** Oh!  Well if it helps.. do you know how long it will take to replace the ones around here?\n\nWe were going to be replacing $Nurses computer soon anyway I guess.. no harm in bumping her up in priority.\n\n&gt; **$Anime:** We should have all of these done either by later today or sometime tomorrow.\n\n&gt; **$Wrath grinning**: We just don’t want to miss any.\n\n$Nurse helpfully digs through her keys to find one that will open the door, $Anime and I both hold our breath in anticipation.  The lock clicks and the door slowly creaks open.\n\n&gt; **$Nurse:** Ill leave you to it!  Let me know if you need anything!\n\n$Nurse leaves and $Anime tentatively approaches the door.\n\n&gt; **$Anime:** Oh my…\n\nThe room was tiny, a small cot with delusions of grandeur was acting like a full bed, a light yellowed with age shining down the hall a hall closet, and a bathroom that can only be defined as such by the presence of a claustrophobic shower.\n\n&gt; **$Wrath:** Ive seen prison cells bigger than this.. I wonder-\n\n&gt;**$Anime had opened the closet and her exclamation cut me off** You need to see this!\n\nAnd there it was.  The creature from beyond time.  A testament to ages long since past!  It was an old monster of a computer.  An Apple machine from back in 1983 found its way back to the world from the time before either $Anime or I were born.   We spend a minute staring at it our expressions a blend of fear and awe.\n\n&gt; **$Wrath:** Holy… how old is that thing?\n\n&gt; **$Anime:** I have no idea.. What should we do about it?\n\n&gt; **$Wrath:** Kill it with fire?\n\n&gt; **$Anime gave me the look:**  I think its already dead.\n\n&gt; **$Wrath:** You can never be too careful.\n\nWe stare in reverent silence for a minute.  Then we start poking it.\n\n&gt; **$Anime:** Do you think we can turn it on?\n\n&gt; **$Wrath:** Do we really want to turn it on?\n\nSo we start trying to turn it on.  After a few (read: more than a few) unsuccessful minutes of troubleshooting we give up.\n\n&gt; **$Anime:** Can we take it with us?\n\n&gt; **$Wrath:** Well.. We are supposed to replace all the old computers we find.\n\n$Anime giggles, to this day im not sure if it was in joy or madness.\n\nWe waved the nurse over to let her know what was up, she was as surprised as we were to see something quite that old.  $Anime and I reverently packed up the old machine (in handling it I found some manufacturer imprints, along with the date of its creation.  Which is the only reason we knew how old it was) and replaced it with a new shiny computer that may or may not have seen the light of day (or any light at all..) since.\n\nThat computer became $Anime’s free time project for the next month as she, and the rest of the IT staff tried to breath life back into the eldritch abomination.  We never did get it working again, but we had fun trying!\n\n**Edit:** Apparently the automatic moderation didnt like my original formatting.  Sorry!  Hopefully this try works!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8cz3df/more_from_aviation_maintenance_altered_paths/",
        "text": "*This post was inspired by a post in Ask Reddit I saw this morning.  A lot has happened, a lot has changed over the years…*\n\nMany, many years ago, back when I was an optimistic young kid who thought he could be anything, do anything, I had zero desire to get into aircraft maintenance.  I’d grown up subsisting on a steady diet of flight sims, Star Wars and Top Gun—Goose was a saint, Maverick was Dangerous, and Wedge was a better pilot than Luke.  Unfortunately, I wore glasses which automatically nixed any hopes I had of being a combat pilot.  However, it didn’t block me from flying other aircraft in the civilian world.  My uncle is a pilot for $AviationCompany (the very same who employs me currently) and had coached me on his own path: college flight school, followed by being an instructor, then flying small cargo, and eventually getting into the Big Leagues with one of the major air carriers, cargo or passenger.\n\nDuring my senior year in high school, I paid a visit to a few schools, to include one who claimed to have an aviation program in South Carolina (and I discovered had I gone there, I would likely have been expelled for being a bad influence…or fomenting revolution…not sure what sub to post THAT story in…) **(Update: [Here's that story.](https://redd.it/8d5jus) )** and the school I would eventually choose.  In the fall of 2001, I arrived at the second best University in the U.S. for aviation training, far in the frozen northern plains, planning to pursue a degree in Commercial Aviation.  Before I could start my core flight classes, however, I had to knock out my generals, electives and the Intro to Commercial Aviation course.  Interested in following my journey, my uncle invited me to blog about becoming a commercial pilot on a popular flight-sim site.\n\nThere were, however, two problems.  The first was fairly simple: I did not come from a family with any semblance of wealth.  Flight training is expensive, and I was looking at a very large number of loans once I started trying to get flight hours.  The second issue?  Well….\n\n***\n\n*0800 September 11th, 2001*\n\n&gt;**Classmate** “Hey, a plane hit the world trade center in New York!”\n\nThe interruption to the Acting I elective course I’d chosen was short lived; the little single engine Cessnas that were so prevalent over campus were the first aircraft that leapt to mind, so naturally we all assumed it was merely a terrible accident and left it at that.  Class was soon over and not having much to do for the rest of the morning, I headed back to my dorm room to get some CounterStrike in.  As I was walking up the stairs, I ran into my roommate who was singing as he was heading down to class.\n\n&gt;**Roommate** “It’s the end of the world as we know it…Oh, hey Zee, turn on the TV when you get back upstairs.”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Oookay…Sure…”\n\nArriving in my room, I tossed my bag on my bed and grabbed the remote, flipping the TV on just in time to see video of a 757 slamming into the south tower.  Within moments I was on the phone, calling my parents to find out if they’d heard from my uncle.  \n***\n*1430, September 11th, 2001*\n\nBecause of the size of the class, Introduction to Commercial Aviation was held in a large auditorium.  Despite the number of students, the room was silent enough to hear a pin drop.  We were all still in shock, taking in the events of the day and just barely beginning to scratch the surface of the implications they had on our futures.  \n\n&gt;**Instructor** “I figure you all have a ton of questions how this will relate to the industry, so I’m just going to open the floor today to talk about it.  Yes, up front?”\n\n&gt;**Student** “So...what’s going to happen to us?”\n\n&gt;**Instructor** “Well, to put it bluntly, you’re all pretty much screwed.  The commercial aviation industry is about to collapse for the next few years….”\n\n***\nI stopped paying attention to class at that point…and to most of my other classes as well.  Realizing how deep a hole I was starting to dig, I made the attempt to shift over to air traffic control, since I figured that wouldn’t be as affected by the attack…but I didn’t have any pre-requisites completed to get into that, so I floundered for the second semester.  I was depressed and let myself get sucked into the social scene.  \n\nI actually ended up dropping out at the end of the school year, going back home and getting a job at a barbeque joint, getting fired from said job, and then getting a job at a dying department store chain.  I had no idea what to do with myself, all I knew is that I was done for college for the foreseeable future.  Then my brother mentioned an idea of how I could get back to school and maybe even get it paid for…\n***\n\n*Military Entrance Processing Station, May, 2003*\n\nIt had taken a year to get a wavier for a knee injury I’d had when in High School,  but after being persistent and bugging the recruiters to keep pushing for it, I finally was told I’d be allowed to join the Army.  I don’t think the majority of the recruiters at the station wanted to bother with me; I was a pudgy fellow with crazy, bushy hair and glasses, your typical nerd.  The recruiter I’d gotten in contact with, however, didn’t give up and was rather surprised at my drive to continue pushing, even when the rest had written me off. My Recruiter was a Blackhawk Crewchief, and he’d mentioned the possibility of going flight warrant officer and flying helicopters, as my eyes could be corrected to 20/20 vision. I spent the day at the processing station getting examined, poked, prodded, coughing and duck-walking in my underwear, but finally (after getting dressed) I got to sit down with the civilian career counselor.  \n\n&gt;**Counselor** “I see here on your dream sheet you wanted a job in Air Traffic Control.  Unfortunately, you need to have clean 20/20 vision without correction.  However…I *do* happen to have a slot in a hot new area—information technology!”\n\nComputers were a hobby, but I didn’t want to give up on the dream of aviation.  \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “No thanks, I’d really prefer to stick with Aviation.  Can you see if you’ve got anything for a crewchief?”\n&gt;**Counselor** “I see.  Can you wait outside for a few minutes?”\n\nHe sent me back out to the waiting area and left me to wait for a good half an hour before calling me back in.\n\n&gt;**Counselor** “…I’m sorry, we just don’t have any aviation slots at all right now.  But IT—“\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Really, no thanks.”\n\n&gt;**Counselor** “Are you sure?  There’s a nice bonus…”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “No, I would rather be a crewchief or something.  I guess I can wait until something opens up.”\n\n&gt;**Counselor** “grrr….Okay, I’ll make some calls, see if I can find something.  Can you please go wait outside again?”\n\nI spent another half hour, or maybe even whole hour, waiting and watching TV before the obviously irritated counselor called me back in.\n\n&gt;**Counselor** “Okay, are you sure you don’t want to do IT?  It’s got a bonus…”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Very.   Did you find anything aviation?”\n\n&gt;**Counselor** *sigh* “Yes.  We can do Aircraft Powerplant Repair or Aircraft Hydraulics.”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “No crewchief slots?  At all?”\n\n&gt;**Counselor** “No, but…” \n\nHe smiled as he had finally figured out how to rope me into something.\n\n&gt;**Counselor** “…You can be a crewchief as a Powerplant mechanic!”\n\nI’ll admit, I got excited.  \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Really!?  Okay!  Any sort of bonus?”\n\n&gt;**Counselor** “Oh, no, sorry, we don’t have any budget for those in Aviation…oh, and you have to do six years…”\n\nAt that same moment, in Washington State, a female who would become my best friend in Germany was signing up for a four-year enlistment, received a $10k bonus and guaranteed Blackhawk crewchief.\n\nI, of course, bit hard on that offered hook.  And the rest, as they say, was history.\n\n**TL:DR;** *I fix aircraft because terrorists.*\n\n***\nEnjoy what you've read?  [Read all the rest of the tales!](https://redd.it/7i0esb)\n",

        "text": "This story takes place at an old employer. They were a nonprofit private school. Overall, they were great but were limited by funds for a two man IT department. Most days consisted of me doing the planned upgrade or maintenance and wasting time since I was part-time and needed to be a warm body there to take home a paycheck.\n\nPart of my duties was help desk type support. Most people were more than understanding about my lack of time and would actually communicate if something could wait or if they needed me to get there ASAP. They respected my time and I in turn would actually come if it was an emergency that kept them from doing any work. Anyways we had this one user who I will call Debbie. Debbie was a nice lady who had no idea what the word emergency meant. After the first few times, I stopped going to her immediately and would make her wait for a bit since more than likely she was just doing something stupid and would figure it out or would figure a way around it for a while. One day Debbie was exceptionally frantic. She called me and I could tell in her voice that there was a big problem.\n\n&gt; Debbie: xxifty, please come quick its an emergecy.\n\n&gt;xxifty: Whats going on? (rolls eyes thinking I hope this isn't another mouse scroll issue)\n\n&gt;Debbie: I can't do such and such in *random Adobe program*. I really need you to come quick I need to turn this in ASAP.\n\nSo I go down to her computer and look at what she is trying to do.  Now I am not into design so I have to spend a few minutes just getting familiar with the Adobe program. All along  she is trying to rush me while I am telling her \"it will take as long as it takes because I don't know anything about this program\" and \"you have more experience with this program than I do.\"\n\nI figure out the little thing she wanted thanks to finally giving up and googling it. I show her how, ask if she needs anything else, and leave. About 15 minutes later I get another frantic call from her.\n\nRealizing that this is just another user training, I decide to finish what I am doing before I go down. I tell her I will come down when I can. Five minutes after that I get a frantic call from her begging me to come down now.\n\nI figure she is probably just having a bad day so I go ahead and go down, Google what she needed to know, show her how to Google then leave. I tell her if she has anymore stuff she needs to know how to do, look there first.\n\nAt this point I am pretty proud of myself, I have taught a man (or woman) to fish as they say and I start back on my domain controller migration (which went really smooth despite being interrupted) and finish my work for the day.\n\nThe next day I have another series of random calls where I end up going to retrain her how to use Google. After some time, I go to my boss's office and complain about her. (Note: my boss focuses on empathy but knows with just two of us that there are things we shouldn't waste time on). I estimate how much time I have been spending over at  Debbbie and am really just trying to get some empathy from someone who knows her and knows how difficult she can be. He listens and asks if I showed her Google. I told him of coarse but she clearly doesn't get Google so how is she going to understand this Adobe program. He tells me he will take care of it from now on and that anytime she calls just get him to go down there so I don't end up saying something I will regret.\n\nA few days later, I notice him meeting with the dean who is her boss. I don't think anything of it since they both deal with communications. I figure they are planning some layout of something and am glad I don't have to be a part of it. However, a few days after that all of a sudden Debbie is reassigned to the receptionist and the receptionist is moved to her position. Basically Debbie from then on just answers the phone and greets people at the door. I still had my occasional freak out from her such as if Facebook was down or her mouse won't scroll again. But anytime that 0 extension called, I would just check the voicemail because it was always her complaining over not understanding how the internet works, or a sales call. ",

        "text": "It started simply enough - a ticket from a small downtown client asking for a wireless adapter. Or so I heard. The adapter was procured easily enough, but getting the client available to install wasn't. This went on for a couple days till the tech was reassigned to Antarctica, and another took over. He came very close to closing the ticket; \"hey will you be available today?\" \"sure, 2:30\" then at 1pm \"sorry, can we reschedule?\" This happened multiple times, and the one time he was able to pin the client down was the day after he'd taken the company car, and had forgotten one tiny thing in it. And unfortunately for him that was the day another person had the car and was taking it to the other side of the state.  \nAround then I was starting to pick up more projects in the area and offered to take over. Miracle of miracles, we were able to agree on a time and stick with it! I thought it would be a one-and-done but allotted a decent amount of time till my next appointment anyway.  \n\nThe first sign of things going awry was parking. Between the protesters and the food trucks there weren't any spots for blocks. Eventually I snagged one, and met the client! He told me he'd take me to the kiosk that needed the adapter. From the ticket notes I had thought this was a desktop in an odd location, but when he led me to the storage closet I started getting concerned...  \nAnd then he pulled out what appeared to be an arcade cabinet at first blush.  \nThey'd gotten two kiosks as a donation, and wanted to use them for check-in purposes. Wooden cabinets with odd-looking screens that turned out to be a POS system, and an old UPS in the bottom that he told me they hoped to use to power the thing at its duty station.  \nFirst problem, explaining the concept of \"battery *backup*\". Second, the adapter I had most certainly would not work out of the box with that OS. I had a CD with drivers but the thing had no CD tray. I could borrow a nearby computer, but I'd left my USB stick at the office and no one had a spare. What to do?  \n~~Un~~Fortunately, it had an Ethernet port. So we wheeled the contraption into the offices and nabbed the guest jack. I borrowed a laptop and ripped the CD, then copied the files over and manually installed the adapter.  \nThat's when he told me there were *two* kiosks.  \nTL;DR My kingdom for a flash drive\n",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8cmt51/yeah_its_on_fire_part_1/)\n\nHi there, TFTS. You can stop harassing me now. This story happened when I worked in a B2B Internet Service Provider as my first real job, a lowly L1 Helldesk, way back in the beginning of this decade. \n\nAs a little more background before I start, $ISP is a multinational company, although our specializing in B2B market means that we are a small player in this country., certainly much smaller than $OtherVendor. $Customer is also a multinational, billion-dollar business with branches all over the globe, they've been using $ISP's services for a couple of years now, before that they exclusively use $OtherVendor.\n\nit’s now Monday morning in $ISP and I’m in my 13th hour working right after night shift. Showering, fresh clothes, and double time certainly perked me up though, as well as the fresh cup of builder’s tea I have on my desk. \n\n$L3 arrives at the Helldesk bullpen\n\n&gt;$L3: Hey $Me, where’s that router?\n\n(I pointed to the charred router beside our spare pile.)\n\n&gt;$L3: Holy cow that looks ugly. To think that $ISPSales asked me whether replacing it was even necessary... \n\n&gt;$Me: Technically it does work, but I think it's best to retire the Terminator from service.\n\n&gt;$L3: Terminator, huh? I can kinda see that. Anyway, you ready? They are already waiting for us.\n\n&gt;$Me: Here or $Site?\n\n&gt;$L3: Neither. We’re having a brunch at a nearby restaurant \n\nSo $Me, $L3, and $ISPManager arrived at the restaurant, where $Customer is waiting. $CustTech is there, as I expected, with $CustManager. I didn’t know the other person sitting with them.\n\n&gt;$L3: Hi guys, this is $Me, He was the onsite engineer last Saturday. \n\n&gt;$Me: Hi there, good to meet you.\n\n&gt;$CustTech: Hi $L3, $Me, you know $CustManager, and this is $CustDirector, our Director of Operations (**!**).\n\nI’ve met $CustManager and I’ve seen $CustDirector in email communications. But for him to come? This has to be a big deal. No wonder $ISPManager joined.\n\n&gt;$L3: Thanks for coming here, $CustTech, $CustManager, and $CustDirector. Everyone ordered something yet? $Me, the coffee’s amazing here... \n\n. . . . . \n\n&gt;$L3: This is a bit unorthodox, but I think it’s best for $CustTech to explain this meeting’s objective to everyone, just to make sure nothing is lost in communication. \n\n&gt;$CustTech: Right, thanks for having us here. I talked a bit about this with $L3 earlier and called this meeting as a follow up to last Saturday’s problem. \n\n&gt;$ISPManager: The fire incident? Is there anything we missed?\n\n&gt;$CustManager: No, more like we're missing someone entirely.\n\n&gt;$ISPManager: Not exactly sure what you guys are talking about.\n\n&gt;$CustManager: Let’s ask $Me, Did you see $OtherVendor’s tech last Saturday?\n\n&gt;$Me: Not that I’ll recognize one, but I don’t think so. I was the only one working there aside from $CustTech. Are we on the same SLA? (we have 4 hour to recovery Service Level Agreement for $Customer, outside of force majeure)\n\n&gt;$CustTech: Yes, and since the downtime occured simultaneously. You guys should have arrived around the same time. Do you want to guess when $OtherVendor engineer comes on site?\n\n&gt;$CustManager: This afternoon, if we’re lucky.\n\n&gt;$ISPEmployees: **!**\n\n&gt;$CustDirector: That's after setting our rack on fire. And it’s not an isolated incident, either. We have a 99.9% uptime guarantee, but they’re barely making the second nine.\n\n&gt;$ISPManager: What about your contract? \n\n&gt;$CustManager: They discounted some of our bills after a LOT of pressure, but it’s not something we want to do every month.\n \n&gt;$ISPManager: I see... I understand your predicament, but I’m not sure on how we can help you with another company’s SLA\n\n($L3 grins)\n\n&gt;$CustManager: $CustTech, how many links do we have with $ISP? \n\n&gt;$CustTech: 22 dedicated for our offices, about 40 sprinkled in some of our sites\n\n&gt;$CustManager: How about $OtherVendor?\n\n&gt;$CustTech: 22 dedicated, like $ISP, and about 200 in our sites. \n\n&gt;$CustDirector: We’re thinking of migrating all of them to you. \n\nThis is a bombshell. As it is, $Customer is already one of our biggest customer. If they move all of $OtherVendor’s site to $ISP, this will make them our biggest customer by a large margin.\n\n&gt;$ISPManager: That's a bombshell. Should I call $ISPSales here?\n\n&gt;$CustDirector: Please don’t, let’s keep it between us for now. We invited you guys because we need some people to bounce ideas with, to know if it’s viable. That's also why this brunch is on us.\n\n&gt;$ISPManager: (leaning back on his chair) We... might...  be able to handle all of the small sites, should not be too much of a problem… \n\n&gt;$L3: Your 22 offices, though. I don’t think that’s a very good idea. \n\n&gt;$CustDirector: Why is that?\n\n&gt;$L3: If we took over your whole network, you will be completely reliant on us. We are proud of our infrastructure, but problems do happen. \n\n&gt;$CustDirector: What do you propose?\n\n&gt;$ISPManager: We can subcontract another ISP and manage their SLA. But if you want to use them directly, we really don't mind.\n\nI was personally in awe at the discussion. I can troubleshoot most network problems pretty readily. But $L3 and $ISPManager basically redesigned $Customer's network on the back of a napkin that morning. \n\nBeing a lowly L1 operations tech, however, I was not invited to the next few meetings. But from what I heard from $L3, $Customer finally decided to move all of their connections to us, making them our biggest customer.\n\n$Customer's problem with $OtherVendor has been ongoing for a long time. The fire incident turned out to be the straw that broke the camel's back. Reliability is only one part of the equation. Apparently, our prices are also noticeably cheaper compared to $OtherVendor, which makes the decision all the more popular.\n\nThe Terminator? It had its own place behind $ISPManager's desk for a while. Last thing I know another tech brought it back home for their personal lab. Pity I left the company before they gave it away.",

        "text": "CAST OF CHARACTERS   \n* Me - obviously  \n* Supervisor - mine.  \n* Erin - A junior member of tier 2.  \n* Earl - Member of tier 3.  \n* Sam - Earl's boss.  \n* Joe - Property manager of University Dorms.\n\n\n---\n\n*Our heroine, a lovely young-at-heart woman with freshly dyed blonde hair and naturally blue eyes stolls across the office to her desk.  Halfway there she is intercepted by the new supervisor, a giant bear of a man with dark hair, dark eyes and a slight russian accent.*\n\n&gt; **Him:** Hey you!!!  \n\nStartled she freezes.  \n\n&gt; **Her:** What did I do?  \n&gt; **Supervisor:** Do you do hugs?  \n&gt; **Her:** Umm...sometimes?  Is something wrong?  \n\n*He envelopes her in a giant -- but gentle -- hug*   \n\n ***record scratch***     \n ***FREEZE FRAME!***    \n\nYup, That's me!  You're probably wondering how I got here.  Well, I'll tell ya. It all started yesterday when...\n\n*Time rolls back 24 hours and the beginning of the scene repeats itself, but this time in an office with only two other people in it.  Waving at our inventory guy, I clocked in and then headed over to my coworker's desk.*\n\n&gt; **Me**: Hey Erin, anything going on today?   \n&gt; **Erin**: It's a Sunday.  Not much ever happens on a Sunday.  \n&gt; **Me**: *knocks on the wooden desk* Please. Don't jinx it!  \n&gt; **Erin** *(smiling at my tired joke)***:** We've got a video ticket from Homes on the Hill.  Guy says all of his channels are out.  I've reset his ONT but it didn't make any difference.  Sorta wondering if I should contact tier 3.  \n&gt; **Me:** Did you check the controller?  \n&gt; **Erin**: Yeah.  $HDController shows no errors.  \n&gt; **Me**:  What about the $SDController?  \n&gt; **Erin**:Ummm....  \n&gt; **Me**:  Gotta check 'em all.  \n\n&gt; Controller: Error 404: Controller Not Found.\n\n&gt; **Me**:  Well that right there is worth emailing tier 3 about.   \n&gt; **Erin:** Is it an outage?   \n&gt; **Me**:  I don't know.  Maybe. It could be that our GUI to the controller is down but the controller itself is still working. Let me take a look at the ONTs  \n\nAn ONT is a piece of hardware that funnels video and internet into a person's apartment. They are linked together on a GPON which can be remotely manipulated through a GUI that we don't have a name for.  All I know is that it is a ruddy bloody PITA to log into, and if you leave it alone for more than five minutes it will log you out.  Welcome to my world.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when the GUI (finally) loaded was a sea of yellow alerts.  The second thing I noticed was that every single ONT had a \"Video LOS\" error on  it.  LOS stands for \"Loss of signal\".  No signal means no cable.\n\n&gt; **Me:**  We've only gotten one ticket from this property?  \n&gt; **Erin:** yeah.  \n&gt; **Me:** Strange.   \n&gt; **Erin:** So is it an outage?  \n&gt; **Me** *(long pause)***:** Yeah.  This is an outage.  I'll start the problem ticket if you do the email.  \n\nBy now I've created so many problem tickets that I can do them in my sleep and this one was knocked out in about in 2 minutes.  I pass the link over to Erin who is laborously typing up what sounds like a thesis but ends up being two sentences.\n\n    From: Erin\n    To: Tier 3\n    CC: Admins \n    Subject: Video Outage at Homes on the Hill.\n      We have what appears to be a video outage at The Apartments on the Hill.  \n      The Standard Def controller is 404ing and there are LOS error on all ONTs.  \n\nThat was a perfectly acceptable message, minus one little thing: screencaps.  The unofficial First Rule of Tier 3 is \"Pics or it didn't happen.\"  I was in the process of forwarding Tier 3 the pics I'd attached to the problem ticket when the their reply hit my inbox.\n\n    From: Earl\n    To: Erin, Tier 3\n    CC: Admins \n    Subject: Re: Video Outage at Homes on the Hill\n      There is only one incident attached to that problem ticket.  What makes you think this is an outage?\n\n&gt; ***Inner me:*** `Really dude?  You noticed that but missed the` `part about the error messages?`  \n\n    From: simAlity\n    To: Earl, Erin, Tier 3\n    CC: Admins \n    Subject: Re: Video Outage at Homes on the Hill\n       All ONTs have LOS errors and the $SDController is offline. Please see the attached screencaps.\n\nThat was enough to get Earl to pause his game or whatever it was he was doing and take us seriously.  Twenty minutes later we got another response:\n\n     From: Earl\n     To: simAlity, Erin, Tier 3\n     CC: Admins \n     Subject: Re: Video Outage at Homes on the Hill\n        I've powercycled the $SDController.  It should be back online.  \n        The transponder was offline.  I've turned it back on.  Screencap attached.\n\nAfter confirming that the SD controller was indeed online, I logged back into the ONT server just in time to watch the LOS messages disappear...and then return.  Then they disappeared again...and returned again.\n\n    From: simAlity\n    To: Earl, Erin, Tier 3\n    CC: Admins\n    Subject: Re: Video Outage at Homes on the Hill\n       SD controller's back online but the Video LOS errors remains.  Whatever you did fixed it for a skinny minute but now it is broken again.\n\n\n    From: Earl\n    To: simAlity, Erin, Tier 3\n    CC: Admins, Dispatch\n    Subject: Re: Video Outage at Homes on the Hill\n       The transponder won't stay on.  We'll have to get a tech to look at it tomorrow.  Passing ticket to dispatch.\n\nSometimes all you can do is all you can do. After adding few more notes about the issue I informed our tier 1 so that they wouldn't send up any more tickets and closed the tab.\n\nThirty minutes later the sound of breaking glass filled my ears.  A service alert had arrived.\n\nA service alert is issued anytime anything from a router to an access point goes offline.  We get dozens of them every day and it can be easy to tune them out.  One of the first things I did after starting at the Baby Bell was to program my email to play a sound effect whenever we got one about a gateway or a router. Even then I have to change the sound effect every other month.  This month's effect, BreakingGlass.wav is especially appropriate.\n\nThis service alert announced that a router, two gateways and every frakkin' switch at The Cabins in the Woods had fallen offline.  This is known as a site outage.  \n\n&gt;**Erin:** We've lost the Cabins.  \n&gt;**Me:** Yeah I see it.  \n&gt;**Erin** *(pause)***:** Weather is good.  No power outages in the area.  \n&gt;**Me** *(typing one thing and reading another)***:** Equipment is down hard though.  I'll call the property.  Maybe someone is in the office.  \n&gt;**Erin:** On a Sunday?  \n&gt;**Me:** You never know.   \n\nErin's pessemism was well placed.  Even though the office wasn't supposed to close for another hour, nobody answered the phone.  Erin called the carrier and learned that a fiber cut had taken out service to most of the town. \n\n&gt;**Erin**:  Do you need me to stay late?  \n&gt;**Me:** Nah, I'm good.  See you tomorrow.\n\nFor the next little bit all was quiet on the networking front.  I cleared out the ticket queue and took my lunchbreak.  When I returned there was a message from tier 1 on my screen.\n\n&gt; **Tier1:** simAlity?  We're getting a lot of calls from The Apartments on the Corner. They're saying that the cable is out.   Can you take a look?  \n&gt; **Me:** of course.  One sec.  \n\nUnlike Homes on the Hill, The Apartments on the Corner has one controller for all types of channels. Loading it up, I again find myself in a sea of errors.  But at least these are things I can fix.\n\n&gt; **Me** *(to tier 1)***:** Confirmed.  40 channels off the air. Working to fix it now.  ETR, one hour.  If we don't have a problem ticket already, go ahead and create one.  \n&gt; **Tier1:** Aye-aye ma'am!  \n\nThe next 45 minutes was spent rebooting components and services.  While this may sound impressive it mostly involved a bunch of button pushing.  The hardest part was sitting on my hands and waiting for the reboots to finish.  But finally they did and I had the satisfaction of seeing all channels back online.  \n\n*BreakingGlass.wav*\n\nThis service alert actually brought good news.  The Cabins were back online! Well...mostly online.  A brief but through examination of the wifi controller showed a lot of bad connections.  This isn't uncommon immediately after a site outage.  After monitoring things for fifteen minutes and watching it go from bad to worse I decide that a tier 3 intervention will be required.\n\n&gt; **Me** *(to tier 1)***:**  Be aware (if you aren't already) that we have a wifi issue at Cabin in the Woods.  We're working on it now.  \n&gt; **Tier 1 Supervisor:** Understood.  Could you also take a look at The University Dorms?  \n&gt; **Me:** Of course.  What seems to be the problem?  \n&gt; **Tier 1 Supervisor:** They're reporting that the Internet just went out.\n&gt; **Me:** How many calls?  \n&gt; **Tier 1 Supervisor:** Five in the past 15 minutes.  \n&gt; **Me:** crap.  Let me escalate this Cabins issue and then I'll take a look at the University.  \n\n    From: simAlity\n    To: Tier 3\n    CC: Admins\n    Subject: Wifi Connectivity issue at Cabins In the Woods\n       Cabins in the Woods just came back up after a three hour outage.  The wifi controller is having trouble stabilizing. Two hundred out of six hundred devices with no or invalid IP address.  Please check and advise. \n       Attached: Screencap.png\n\nAs I was typing a another service alert arrived. \n\n*Whatever that is, is going to have to wait.* I thought as I opened the service alert.  It was an empty threat but when you have as much crap going on as I often do, empty threats are a necessary part of keeping your sanity.  \n\nAs it happened the newest Service Alert simply reinforced the Tier 1 supervisor's message to me.  All the network equipment at University Dorms (a 800 bed student housing complex) was offline. Fun!\n\nAfter creating the problem ticket I called the property and left a message on the emergency maintenance line.  99% of the time this is an exercise in futility.  Ten minutes later my GM line rang and on the other side was a member of the 1%.\n\n&gt; **Me:** Thank you for calling the BabyBell.  How may I help you?  \n&gt; **Caller:** yes, this is Joe, property manager of the University Dorms.  I'm down in our server room with a laptop.  What can I do to get things back online?  \n&gt; **Me:** Fantastic!  Okay, first thing we need to do is find the router. It should be labeled `r1`.   \n&gt; **Joe:** Found it.  \n&gt; **Me:** Does it have any lights.  \n&gt; **Joe** *(sounding surprised)***:** Actually, no.  It doesn't.    \n&gt; **Me:** Okay. Go around to the back of the rack and find the power cord for the r1. \n&gt; **Joe:**  Done.  \n&gt; **Me:** Follow the powercord back to where it plugs in.    \n&gt; **Joe:**  Okay.  It appears to be plugged into some sort of generator thing.      \n&gt; **Me:** That's probably the UPS.  Does it have lights on it?  \n&gt; **Joe:** I see the power light is on but the status light is orange.  That's probably a bad sign.  \n&gt; **Me**  Yeah you can say that. Did y'all have a power outage sometime this evening?   \n&gt; **Joe:** Yeah.  It went off and came back on.  That was 90 minutes ago though.  We lost Internet no more than 20 minutes ago.  Maybe 30, max.  \n&gt; **Me:** Something must be preventing the UPS from going back to accepting power from the outlet.  Could be a blown fuse.  I'm assuming the lights in the MDF are on, right?  \n&gt; **Joe:** Of course.   \n&gt; **Me:** Then probably not a bad outlet or a blown fuse.  I mean, I guess it could be a blown fuse inside the UPS but that's a bit above my head.  So, what I want you to do is unplug the r1 from the UPS and plug it into a wall outlet.   \n&gt; **Joe:** What about the rest of the stuff plugged into the UPS?  \n&gt; **Me:** Let's take it one thing at a time.  \n&gt; **Joe:** Looks like I need to clear a path between the rack and the outlet.  This will take a couple of minutes.  \n&gt; **Me:** Take your time.  \n\nAgainst the background sounds of him moving what sounded like bunch of bowling balls, I checked my email.  There was one new message.\n\n    From: Earl  \n    To:  simAlity, Tier 3\n    CC: Admins \n    Subject: Wifi Connectivity issue at Cabins In the Woods.\n      All devices are connected with good IP addresses.  Problem must have resolved itself.  In the future please wait ten minutes before contacting tier 3.\n\nGritting my teeth against a strong desire to tell him what I thought of his instructions I pulled up the wifi controller for the Cabins.  Twenty seconds later I pound out a reply.\n\n    From: simAlity,\n    To: Earl, Tier 3\n    CC: Admins  \n    Subject: Wifi Connectivity issue at Cabins In the Woods\n      Half the access points are offline.  \n\n&gt; **Joe:** I can hear you typing all the way over here.  Everything alright?  \n&gt; **Me (keeping the bite out of my voice with effort):** Yup.  Just dealing with another situation.  \n&gt; **Joe:** Well I'm about to plug the router into this wall outlet.  If this thing electricutes me, you can have my big screen TV.  \n&gt; **Me** *(ever aware that all calls are monitored)***:** If you don't feel safe...  \n&gt; **Joe:** I'm joking!  \n&gt; **Me:** Just making sure.  \n&gt; **Joe:**  Okay I see a lot more lights on the router.  They're flashing.  Actually a LOT of lights are flashing.  \n&gt; **Me:** Excellent!  This means we are on the right track.  Next you want to find the gateway.  It should be right under or over the router.  \n&gt; **Joe:** Found it.  No Lights.  It also appears to be plugged into the UPS thing.  Want me to move the power cord?  \n&gt; **Me:** Got it in one.  \n\nWe did this routine with the core switch and the wifi controller.  Finally everything that had been plugged into the UPS was plugged into a wall outlet.  \n\n&gt; **Me:** Give me a minute to check system status.  *one minute later* Gateway is up, wifi controller is up.  Switches are up.... Looks like we're back in business.  Are you able to connect to the Internet on your phone?  \n&gt; **Joe:** I am indeed.  \n\nAfter a few closing remarks Joe hung up a happy man.  Whew!  \n\nAfter closing the half-dozen tabs that I had opened over the course of Joe's call and then checked the Cabin's WiFi Controller.  All access points were back online.  In my email was a message from Earl's boss, Sam.  \n\n    From: Sam\n    To:  Earl, simAlity, Tier 3\n    CC: Admins \n    Subject: Wifi Connectivity issue at Cabins In the Woods.\n       Restarted the wifi controller.  Monitoring the DHCP service to make sure it doesn't overload again.  Please let me know if you need anything else.\n\nI've worked here too long to believe that Sam's intervention means that he will have a chat with Earl and Earl will apologize for his \"mistake\".  But I do appreciate the intervention none the less.  \n\nThe next couple of hours were spent staring at the ceiling hoping against hope that nothing else would go wrong before I went home.  My hope was in vain.  Half an hour before quitting time (I kid you not) another service alert arrived.\n\nThis one came from The View at The Park (TVATP). Obviously that's not the real name but it is a reasonable approximation.  Where apartment complexes come up with the names they use is beyond me.  Anyway TVATP is a medium size complex about a hundred miles from the far side of the back of the beyond.  It is so far in the boonies that none of the major ISP or carriers service the area and we have to use a little basement business carrier.  As in, one guy runs this little ISP like a one-man-band.  We'll call this place Boonies Online (BOL).  After calling the property (no joy, phones were down) I gave BOL a call and got an answer I will never forget.\n\n&gt; **BOL:**  Hello?  \n&gt; **Me:**  Hi.  Not sure I have the right person.  But this is simAlity calling from the Baby--   \n&gt; **BOL:** Look I'm driving through a fking blizzard taking a generator to my data center.  I'll get service back up as soon as I can.   \n&gt; **Me:**  Okay.  Umm.... Text me when it is back up?   \n&gt; **BOL:**  Yeah.  Sure.  Crap!  Gotta drive.  *click*  \n\nI stared at my phone for 30 seconds after he hung up and then burst out laughing like a mad woman.  Clearly I wasn't the only one having a craptastic day at work.  \n\nAfter writing up the call, the ticket, and sending a message to tier 3 about the ongoing outage it was finally -- FINALLY -- time to go home.  \n\nWhich brings us back to the present day.  \n\n&gt; **Supervisor:**  You did GREAT!  I kept seeing those messages coming in and wondering if I should get you some backup but you handled it like a boss!  \n&gt; **Me** *(flustered)***:** I wouldn't be much of a tech if I couldn't handle a few curve-balls.  \n&gt; **Supervisor:** If you say so.  \n\nBuoyed by the (extremely rare) compliment I walked the rest of the way to my desk feeling like I was walking on cloud 9.  I was so happy I almost didn't notice the person sitting in the spare chair near my cube until he stood up to greet me.  \n\n&gt; **Me:** Hi Sam!  What can I do for you?  \n&gt; **Sam:** I was wondering if you would be interested in joining tier 3?  \n\n--- \n\n[More stories from me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/search?q=author%3Asimality&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all)\n\n(Edit: Fixed formatting errors)",

        "text": "So today is day 3 of this onsite where I am trying to get this ancient DOS computer up and running so the client can reflash this processor that controls a whole production line of stuff.\n\nIt's pouring out today and I gather up my stuff, making sure to bring a folding table and folding chair because I didn't want to spend another day on a factory floor.  Once I got there we set up and I took a closer look at the PLC controller thingie (unfortunately I know nothing about this stuff, I just work on computers).\n\nTurns out they weren't turning the thing on properly before.  The big green button saying start wasn't a tip off, until I pressed it.  Then the PLC controller turned on and we probably will be able to program it.  So got DOS 6.22 out because that is the only reliable installer floppies that I currently have.  Got DOS installed and installed their program.  Tried to work out how to get the program to connect to the processor without any success as always.  Decided to hook up the client's original hard drive and have a peek through it because the last time I didn't get a good look at the files.  Upon booting DOS up again and changing directory to D:, I found that everything was intact and the only issue with the drive was that the operating system wasn't loading.\n\nThis got me thinking, could I copy this program over to the new drive... the answer was no.  It didn't work copied over, however, turns out it will work from the old hard drive.  This was while booted into the new hard drive loaded with DOS 6.22.  Bear in mind, the old hard drive had DOS 5.0 installed so how that works, I don't know.  Probably something to do with DOS just being so simple in terms of drivers and overall compatibility.  So once we started the original program stored on the old hard drive, we found out that the whole issue with us connecting to the processor was down to what is called a KT address.  Essentially, a KT address specifies where the program will be sent into the little computer containing the processor to control the process line.  If you're lost by now, don't worry, I'm still lost too.\n\nSo after a few minutes of WTF and how TF did we just do this.  The employee and I flashed the program onto the processor and began hitting buttons.  The PLC2 processor was located under a big board filled with buttons for each piece of machinery on the line.  So the satisfying clunk as you pressed each button was, well, satisfying.  I began hitting different buttons, start, then another start, and finally the start for the first process, and boom, an alarm goes off.  Not sure why the alarm was triggered, but I nearly needed a new pair of pants.  Turns out it was just like that without any errors.\n\nSo the employee called over a specific job title guy, that you know, knows how the hell to run these machines without breaking them.  Not the tech support guy who is giddy about fixing a very expensive machine and project.  All the different machines worked and that was it, I go cold turkey about thinking about all of this and everything is solved.  Well, now back to my normal everyday dealing with peoples' boring problems like Outlook isn't working or Windows won't boot.\n\nOverall, I gave my chances of doing this a 25% chance.  I even told the clients this.  So either I am a genius or very lucky.  I prefer to think both.  This was an amazing learning experience for me and I kinda like the balls to wall, work at the problem till it is solved sort of thing.  Normally, I don't get to go all out with client's because of price or things like that.  With this one, I had full approval to do anything to get it done.  Wish every client was like that, but that's not the small tech support/repair company life.  Maybe once I upgrade to a big corporation it will be different, but from everything I see on here, it looks like it is just more brown pants moments than anything else.\n\nI hope you enjoyed.  This was my first real multi post experience so let me know what you all think.  Learned this in part II, links for both part I and II are below:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8c1r9r/legacy_support_of_clients_computer_ongoing/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8cbvxn/legacy_support_of_clients_computer_part_ii/",

        "text": "Back in time a few centuries (well, technically around 1998) I worked as a desktop support tech for a company.\n\nSome background: A manger of another department wandered over last minute on  Friday to tell me that they had a new hire starting on Monday afternoon.  Some new 20 year old \"fantastic manager\" hire had been hired away (from a Pizza hut) to be a new manager of a department in a company doing \"customer response management\".\n\nI put it on my schedule to image the new guys PC on Monday morning.  Plenty of time in spite of the short notice.\n\nIn Monday morning I get told by my manager that me and the other guy I mostly worked with (Mike C, the SysAdmin) were going to drive out immediately to a city 6 hours away (each way) to go install more RAM in a dozen PC's we co located in a client office.\n\nWe go out, install the memory, test the PC's, and all working.   Have lunch, drive back.\n\nAt this point, my shift had already ended when we got back.  I go upstairs, read some emails before taking off for the day (salary position).\n\nThere new guy wanders into IT, finds my desk.\"Hey, I did not get my PC today.  I need you to give me one NOW.  I HATE working at a desk that is not my own!\"\n\nI told him that my shift was over.  He did not care.  I promised it first thing in the morning.  He says \"No.\" And threatened to go to my manager.\n\nI told him his new PC had not been delivered yet (we were going through an equipment refresh, from using Pentium 1 - 200's to brand new P3's.)\n\nHe insisted I needed to give him a PC NOW or I would be \"out on my a$$\" and unemployed.\n\nI told him I would need to give him a temporary PC until the new one was delivered.  He settled down.  No thank you.  Just an entitled expression with a smug attitude.\n\nI dropped an old Pentium 1 - 60 with minimum RAM and a 200 Mb hard drive on his desk.\n\nHe whined about it.   He waited until batch 3 to get his new one for being a jerk.\n\n(The guy didn't last 2 months at the company.)",

        "text": "This just happened about an hour ago and is also my first time posting here. \n\nI own a small MSP in Georgia. At one point in my life I was a pretty decent technician but these days my job is mostly shaking hands. I try to work a ticket or two every day though just to keep in shape so I can talk intelligently.   Anyway to get to the story..... \n\nToday one of our system monitors alerted us to excessive login failures at one of our largest customers. This is an alert that is set up to let us know if someone has failed to log in successfully several times and is designed to gives us a heads up if there is a brute force attack happening. We have the threshold set pretty low and we get one alert a week just on the shared computers usually.  But this alert was on a faxserver at one of their smaller remote locations. No users typically are at the fax servers so I decided to go ahead and investigate. I fired up screenconnect and was greeted by the windows login welcome screen just spinning. After a few seconds it hit the password authentication window but almost instantly blinked out of it and was trying to log in again.  RED FLAGS immediately! I watched for another 30 seconds or so and saw it hit the login screen again and fail password check 3 more times again almost instantly!  Clearly this was some sort of bot trying to brute force its way into the system.  This is a pretty secure system as things go and we take things like this incredibly seriously.  I am trying to rack my brain and figure out where an attack like this would even come from and why it would be hitting this server which is much less exposed than a lot of other things on the network. \n\nI grabbed two of my senior techs real quick and put them on the case to try and figure out what was happening and where this was coming from.  We didn't want to log into the system because it might have a keylogger going and we didn't know what the situation was so we were pushing out commands on the backend through Labtech.  Everything kept getting weirder and weirder.  We chased down some suspicious processes with open connections, found something talking to amazon ec2..... something talking to azure......but we were able to determine with some effort that those were benign.  We couldn't find an outside source hitting this machine in the firewall or through the switch. So one of my techs said, \"Maybe it has something already on it trying to brute force itself that will phone home once it gets a domain login???\" \n\n So we decided to isolate the machine on the network to test this theory. Sure enough the attack continued even with no communication from the outside.   It didn't make a lot of sense though..... if the machine was already compromised there are better ways to get passwords? Maybe this is an amateur attempt?  So we start looking for rogue processes. Not much is really running on it and everything looks pretty standard. Regardless though something is causing this so we start terminating whatever looks like the most likely offenders. No luck, every 30 seconds 3 failed login attempts about as fast as you can blink.   Eventually we are digging deep and killing svchosts. Nothing is working.  So we deploy a tech to go pick up the server and bring it back to the shop and get it off their network.  In the meantime I call management and let them know we are seeing an attack on their network and we are investigating. \n\n   This place is only a few minutes away, but as the tech is driving over the attacks suddenly stop. One of the processes we had killed had stopped it.  My tech thinks ESET was the last thing he killed. Maybe we have a compromised ESET process???? How would that even happen???  &lt;panic sets in&gt;  Maybe we have a compromised ESET server???   I play through in my head the thousand machines we have running ESET and start calling my deployment tech (who was sick in the hospital today god love him) and start asking him if he had changed anything with deployment and when the last time we rebooted the ESET instance was.  I am pretty close to a full on freak out at this point.  My tech goes ahead and reboots the server to see if the assault continues. After the reboot though it was quiet.  We pushed out a temporary admin account and new password and went ahead and logged into the box to start poking around.  We dug into the event viewer security logs to see what was going on and started to see all of the audit failures.  Weird thing though,  they were all trying our admin account and they were all coming from the local machine???\n\nIf you have ever seen this kind of attack normally what you find here is a bunch of common names and account names being tried from various overseas IP addresses.  You will see several logins under \"john\" and \"chris\" and \"root\" and \"admin\" and \"local\" etc and normally it would not come from the local machine.  If you already have malware running on the local machine there are a million better less obvious ways to collect passwords.\n\n The server had just come back up when my technician got into the remote office. As he walked in, the front desk receptionist said: \"hey when you get done with whatever you are here for this machine next to me keeps beeping at me\". *she waves at the fax server*   My technician walked up to the fax server,  picked up a catalog off of the enter key and then promptly called back to let us know that we are all a bunch of morons. \n\n",

        "text": "Today, as I was walking down the hallway, I was beckoned in by one of our Senior (in every sense of the word) accountants who had forgotten her password that she has used every day for the last year. I reset her password temporarily to \"password\" and had her enter that so that she could create her new password. \n\nFirstly, she had issues typing \"password\" and would consistently type \"passowrd\" even after I corrected her. She then tried several times to put in \"password\" as her new password. This didn't meet our complexity requirements anyways, but she still tried to type in \"password\" and got the \"passwords do not match\" error several times while attempting to do so. After every attempt, she would say something along the lines of \"I don't get this.\" or \"Why is this so complicated!\". I tried to get her to pass the keyboard over to me several times, but she declined every time, saying \"I've got this\" when evidently she didn't. \n\nFinally, after about 10 attempts of inputting the wrong password or not having the new passwords match, I was finally able to get control of the keyboard from her, have her write down what the password was on a sticky note, and then type it in to create her new password. After I successfully set her new password, she says to me \"This system is so stupid!\". \n\n**TL;DR: PEBKAC**",

        "text": "Another post about fire reminded me of this little gem.  \nI used to work in phone support for a company that makes tools for TV and filmmakers. We used to make drive arrays including one that had to have some internal settings made via serial connection before it was used. Customer is a small post house in Colorado somewhere that had bought 4x 5 drive arrays, each unit of the 4 needed to be individually configured before use. As a side note this was the very first support call ever on that array.\n\nOf course the customer hadn't configured the drives and it wasn't long before the data went corrupt. not lost mind you, all the file names were there but nothing could be read. I spent the whole dang day on the phone with them trying this and that even though I was pretty sure the situation was hopeless.\n\nThe owners of the post house were horrible people, they very rarely spoke, everything was yelled. The editor was a really nice guy, I have no idea why he worked for the jerks. He was a bit of a stoner and I'll never forget the following exchange:\n\n&gt;Editor: Dude, I think our problem is solved.  \n&gt;Me: Why, what happened?  \n&gt;Editor: The array is on fire.  \nHe was so calm when he said it, he might as well have said \"My shoe is untied.\"  \n&gt;Me: (panic rising) Well shut it off!  \n&gt;Editor: Not yet.  \n&gt;Me: Why not?  \n&gt;Editor: Wait for it. \n\n \nLong pause\n\n\n&gt;Editor: Okay, they're all on fire now, I'll shut them off.  \n\nIn his brilliance the editor realized that if all 4 arrays were on fire there would be no chance any data could be recovered and we could finally quit trying.  \n\n&gt;Me: I'll go ahead and process your RMA, can I call you Monday to set this one up correctly?\n\nIt turned out there was a design defect in the controller board in the array which would cause every single one of them to catch fire. Eventually the board was redesigned and the arrays were actually pretty good but I'll never forget that calm voice \"The array is on fire.\"",

The customer had vans so took their own PCs, monitors, keyboards etc. over to the new office themselves.  We went to the old office to get their server, UPS and any switches that were there.\n\nWe got to the new office, got the server connected, flood wired the building so all the network ports were live and then went about setting up everyone's PCs.  I set one guy's machine up and was working on a machine opposite him on another desk.  Then the guy whose PC I set up piped up:\n\n&gt; **$User** \"Can you set me up with two monitors? I'd like two monitors instead of one.\"\n\nI went to have a look at the connections on the back of his PC and there was only one VGA port.\n\n&gt; **$Me** \"Sorry, you've only got one connection on the back of your PC, I'll have to send your machine model to our orders department so we can order a graphics card for it.\"  \n&gt; **$User** \"Do you not have any on you?\"  \n&gt; **$Me** \"No, I don't just carry graphics cards around with me, we'll have to order one that will fit into your PC.\"  \n&gt; **$User** \"What do you mean you don't carry them around with you? You should have everything you need with you to complete the job you're on.\"  \n\nI thought he was just messing around at this point so just smiled and nodded, acknowledged that he was joking and carried on setting up the other PC.  I looked up after afew seconds and he was giving me the death stare.\n\n&gt; **$Me** \"You aren't joking are you?\"  \n&gt; **$User** \"No. Why haven't you got a graphics card on you?\"  \n&gt; **$Me** \"I can't carry around every single peripheral that could fit into a PC. I've only got a Ford Focus, I'd never fit everything in.\"  \n&gt; **$User** \"Well you should have a works van then.\"  \n&gt; **$Me** \"Tell that to my boss, I use my own car for my job. I can't have the whole of PC World in it all the time.\"  \n&gt; **$User** \"This is ridiculous. You should have these things on you all the time.\"  \n&gt; **$Me** \"If you asked us before we set off then we could've brought one and got it working for you.\"  \n**$User** \"Why? They're only little cards.\"  \n&gt; **$Me** \"What do you mean? They need to be installed into your PC. There are different connections inside the PCs and depending what connections are on the monitors we need to make sure we get one that will fit and also the leads to connect the screens up.\"  \n\nThis guy then gets his wallet out and puts a credit card on his desk and explains to me that the graphics cards are only this big and you just plug them into your current monitor to add another on to it.\n\nI told him that's not how it works and we'll order one in and come out when we've got one.\n\nGot back to the office and told my boss about this guy being a pain in the arse. My boss spoke to his boss and she said \"yeah, we've had a few complaints about **User** before and him being rude to people.\n\nA few weeks later we had a ticket come in from this customer saying to remove **User** because he'd been let go.",

Followed by a grunt from $Peer who was working on her machine with his forehead furrowed. Deciding it was best to let $Peer try to sort it out, he continued to his desk which still smelled like onions and mustard. $Snickers had been given some time off as well from recent events, specifically involving a sandwich.\n\nIt was not long before $Peer came around the corner with shoulders lowered, $Selben let out a sigh.\n\n&gt; $Selben: What’s up?\n\n&gt; $Peer: I don’t know, $Ditzy’s machine wont power up.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Power light?\n\n&gt; $Peer: Nope.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Power cable?\n\n&gt; $Peer: Tested.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Ask hardware?\n\n&gt; $Peer: He said to ask you.\n\n&gt; $Selben: … Any beeps or anything?\n\n&gt; $Peer: Nope.\n\n$Selben got up and headed over to $Ditzy’s desk, the machine was 100% dead. They got her a loaner machine and ordered a replacement, ticket closed. $Selben attempted to return to his normal day, but after a couple hours he got a call from $Sup2.\n\n&gt; $Sup2: Hey, $Ditzy’s machine wont power on - can you take a look at it?\n\n&gt; $Selben: I already did, this morning with $Peer.\n\n&gt; $Sup2: Her loaner is doing the same thing.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Huh… Okay, I’ll check it out.\n\nYet again, same symptoms no power dead machine. $Selben replaced the surge protector and had $Ditzy walk through what she did. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. She would get up and the machine would just die, they got her another loaner and chalked it up to evil I.T. spirits and all seemed well for the rest of the day.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA few days later $Selben was crossing the parking-lot and rubbed his hands together to keep warm, it was pretty cold. $Ditzy stood at her desk with a frown - apparently the loaner had died as soon as she came in. $Selben and $Sup2 found her new machine was ready so they brought it out to her, naturally she had gotten her manager involved and everyone was upset. $Selben handed her the machine, she set it on the desk and slid forward then reached for the power button. $Selben saw a massive arcing static bolt leap the last inch or so from her finger to the computer.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Well, this ones probably dead now too…\n\n&gt; $Sup2: What?!\n\n$Ditzy repeatedly pushed the power button, but again nothing.\n\n&gt; $Ditzy: HOW?!\n\nThe desk that $Ditzy had recently received was one of those bent acrylic see through desks. As it was cold she had been wearing wool leggings and a wool skirt which resulted in massive static buildup. She had fried every machine she touched - she was advised to not wear wool skirts if possible and the acrylic desk was removed.",

        "text": "Hi there, TFTS. This story happened a long time ago, I didn’t remember the exact dialogue and everything, but the gist of it should be accurate. \n\nI used to work in a B2B Internet Service Provider as my first real job, a lowly L1 Helldesk, way back in the beginning of this decade. \n\nI arrived in the office for my Saturday morning shift, expecting a quiet day so I can catch up on my reading. No sooner than after I finished making my morning cup of tea, the dreaded phone rang.\n\n&gt;$Me: $ISP, good morning\n\n&gt;$CustTech: Hi, $Customer at $Site here… uh… Not sure how to say this, but your router caught fire… \n\n&gt;$Me: **!**\n\n&gt;$CustTech: Yeah, we shut down the power to the rack just now, you should see it soon.\n\nSure enough, one tiny dot turned red in our 1-minute-timeout NMS. Ruining the beautiful sea of green and, with it, my day. This is a premium level customer, all troubles goes up the chain to Director level.\n\n\n&gt;$Me: Yep, got it. I’ll bring a replacement unit onsite. Is there anything else we can help you with?\n\n&gt;$CustTech: Not really, thanks. \n\n&gt;$Me: Right, see you in a few.\n    \nI proceeded to create an incident ticket, (Eth0 on fire!) grab a spare 1841 from our pile and pulled the latest configuration backup from our system (I have complaints about this company, but thoroughness is not one of them.)\n\nAfter a cursory glance, I see their router has simple configuration, OSPF and IPSEC. Nothing I can’t troubleshoot onsite (this was before my first smartphone). A quick ‘wr’ and I went on a 20-minute drive to $Site.\n\nAs I enter the DC the smell of barbecued technology welcomed me. The fire’s not too big and was localized to one rack - luckily a mostly empty one. Fire department didn’t really do much besides documenting everything. Once finished, they went to talk with $CustTech, who signalled me to join.\n\n\n&gt;$Fireman: Is this your equipment? (Pointing to a silver box just 2U below my router)\n\n&gt;$Me: No, mine’s the one above. That looked pretty bad.\n\n&gt;$Fireman: Yeah, I thought it was an internal short or overload or something, but looking at the wiring this seems to be an unsafe install\n\n&gt;$Me and $CustTech: **!**\n\n&gt;$Fireman: You see here? The AC input caught fire and there’s nothing much left of it, but the output survived. See those exposed copper? That’s a half-assed job if I’ve ever seen one.  \n\n&gt;$Me: Whose equipment is that?\n\n&gt;$CustTech: $OtherVendor I think, that’s your backup link. This will be an interesting discussion.\n\nThey cleared us just after 12 and I had the chance to document everything, pull the charred equipment and give it a once-over on a nearby desk.\n\nIts plastic faceplate melted pretty badly on the blinkenlights side and I see scorch mark all over its bottom plate. That being said, It looked pretty good and I remember it didn’t shut down until the power’s turned off. So I plugged in a console cable and powered it up (I now know this is a really bad idea, don’t worry.) Lo and behold, standard boot sequence. I even pulled the latest configuration from it. \n\nThe router was still definitely toast, so I mounted the replacement, rearranged some cabling around, test the connection and confirm the NMS status is green, asked for customer’s signature on my onsite form, and was on my way back to office on time for a late lunch. \n\nBack at the office, I grabbed my cup of tea (cold) and the phone rang again. $L3, an engineer dedicated solely for $Customer called and asked for an update.\n\n\n&gt;$L3: How was it at the $Site?\n\n&gt;$Me: Surprisingly uneventful, considering it involved a fire. Pulled latest config, mounted replacement, test, get out.\n\n&gt;$L3: Wait, you can pull the config? The router TURNED ON?\n\n&gt;$Me: *grins* I was surprised myself, you should see it on Monday.\n\n&gt;$L3: Ha! I’ll put it on a pedestal somewhere. What happened anyway? What’s the cause of fire?\n\n&gt;$Me: $OtherVendor’s equipment, rectifier I think, caught fire\n\n&gt;$L3: $OtherVendor? \n\n&gt;$Me: Yea, the fireman suspects a bad wiring job.\n\n&gt;$L3: Huh...

        "text": "Hi TFTS :)\n\nThis is a followup and a development of [\"Can I bring it?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8bh0gj/it_didnt_work_can_i_bring_it/?st=jg1znd91&amp;sh=6f0b0af0). I was going to answer in the original post, but due to this short, but funny, development, I decided to post a short story! Enjoy ;)\n\nAs normal, I will be $Tech and problem user will be $PU.\n\nTo update the aftermath on last topic: $PU did the 12 hour drive and showed up at my office, all happy. With him, he is carrying his new PC, his old PC and lo and behold, his monitor. As suspected, $PU did not even attempt to follow my instructions and when I asked why, he said \"we didn't have time\". This is a user who has bitched and cried about getting a new PC for months. Also the fact he said \"we\" makes me suspect his manager, who is famous for ignoringany IT policy and top management letting him get away with it, leaving Hell for IT-service.\n\nAnyway, I connect the PC and start the SCCM installation within 2 minutes and then turn to him and say in my most sarcastic tone \"Didn't have time? 2 minutes was all it needed. 5 if uncertain and follow my instructions.\". (I can tell the $PU how I really feel since I've resigned and will leave the company anyway. What are they gonna do, fire me?). $PU looks a bit sheepish but still tries to convince me he did nothing wrong and asked why his printer, which is installed on his old PC didn't work on his new as well as not being able to logon to the $CRM_System. I proceed to tell him a new PC does not have any info from his old PC and on top of that, he did not do the required installation so there is no company installation on the new PC. $PU looks puzzled (yes, he's that tech savvy). \n\nThen on to the famous \"keyboard not working in monitor\" issue. The problem was that he got the \"no signal\" error message, but he did not read the entire message to me when I asked him. Now that I could see, it said \"No signal\" indeed, but it also specified digital. So I switched source to analogue, and lo and behold, it worked. So his \"keyboard\" was actually his PC/docking station.\n\nNow for the next stage of the story: as part of my initial setup of a PC, we activate Bitlocker. This is a company policy and required on all PC's. I activate it, explain to $PU how to enter the code, let him pick his code and watch him punch it once and see the PC booting. I explain to him this code will never change, and he ALWAYS has to punch it before the PC will boot to Windows. $PU nods and says he understands.\n\nToday I get a mail with an upside-down picture of a black screen with some text on it. The text is the Bitlocker recovery key request. $PU proceeds to write \"It started this way.\" Now, I could always look up the recovery key in the AD, but you know what? First stop (company policy) is Servicedesk, not me.\n\nSo *maybe* I logged a ticket with them, telling them to help. *Maybe*.\n\nI hope this is the last post about this specific $PU, I only have 1 month left on my resignation, but you never know...\n\nEdit: To explain, this SD is in English and that is not native to $PU. $PU's English is not super, if I put it that way.",

        "text": "This is the story about the most emotional call I've ever taken. I work at an ISP as a tier 2 representative for tech support. Essentially, one of the jobs I have is programming calling features.\n\n\nThis call in particular happened about a month ago. A ticket had came to my queue about a customer having trouble accessing her voicemails. I dug deeper and found it was full as well. No problem, there were some programming errors, which I fixed and called the customer who will be known as Sweet Elderly Woman. (SEW)\n\n\nSEW: Hello?\n\n\nMe: *intro, verification* So, I am calling because you reported an issue with your voicemail today.\n\n\nSEW: Oh yes! Is it fixed?\n\n\nMe: Yes! It should be. I found that your box is full. It has *maximum amount* of messages in it.\n\n\nSEW: Dear, I'd hate to be a bother but could I get you to go in and delete them for me? (We have a way of accessing the messages if the customer cannot, doesn't want to, etc.) \n\n\nMe: Absolutely. I will gladly do this for you, SEW and I'll call you back when I'm finished?\n\n\nSEW: Yes please!\n\n\nShe thanks me and I hang up to go access the messages. Knowing full well that this is going to take at least 15 minutes, I go and read Wikipedia articles as the messages are playing. I eventually reach the last message and it catches my attention. I stopped reading, listened to it, began tearing up and saved it in her box. I compose myself before calling back.\n\n\nSEW: Hello?\n\n\nMe: Hi! It's /u/devdevo1919 again. I listened to all the messages and deleted them all except for one.\n\n\nSEW: Oh thank you, sweetheart! Why did you leave one?\n\n\nMe: SEW, I think you should listen to it. I will hang up to give you some time, okay?\n\n\nSEW: Okay, dear.\n\n\nI gave her time to listen to the message and called her back. She was crying when I called her back. It was then I learned the story. The message was from her husband who had passed away due to brain cancer 3 days after he left the message. It was him saying goodbye and that he loves SEW so much and he's \"never felt more alive\" all the years she spent with him. \n\n\n\nSEW was crying because he was deceased by the time she got to the hospital and had not heard his voice. She said I gave her part of herself back that she'd lost when he passed away. She thanked me and we disconnected the call.\n\n\nEDIT: To answer some of the comments I am seeing, no I do not have to listen to them but I explain crystal clear that the messages will start playing and I will hear who they're from. This person had the same last name as her which is why I listened to it and saved it.\n\n\nEDIT 2; Wow! Gold?! Thank you so much!!",

        "text": "This started out as a reply to a comment in the [AskReddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8ceyuq/computer_technicians_whats_the_most_bizarre_thing/), but the story got rather long so i decided to put my first story on here. So LTL;FTP.\n\nI work first line tech support at my university, handling students almost exclusively. Most of the problems are fucked up windows installations, failing hardware or help with installing software. And then there are the other problems.\n\nOne time, a guy ($customer) came into our university tech support. He accidentally wiped his drive trying to install a dualboot windows/ubuntu on it and asked if we could perform a data retrieval. We do have such software, because when you maintain thousands of people this will happen sooner or later (usually about twice a week). So I ask him, what kind of data and how much are we talking about? 'Not too much, some personal stuff'. Hmkay, unscrew the drive, hook it to our retrieval system, start the scan. Leave it on overnight so colleagues can check it out in the morning. Apparently it was a busy day, when I got in the day after my colleagues hadn't done anything to the drive as there were clients who needed to be helped. No problem. Data scan was successful and it looks like there's a hell of a lot of stuff on there. Call up the dude:  \n&gt;$**me**: Can you swing by somewhere today to start your data retrieval?  \n$**customer**: No can do, I'm not at the university today and don't want to come by only for that. Can I come tomorrow instead?\n$**me**: No problem, see you then.  \n\nCue next morning: Morning is fine and easy, dude swings by just as I'm about to go on break. I go to the retrieval PC and log in. `Windows has successfully installed new updates`.  \nWell that's just bad luck. Tell the dude of the situation, start a new scan and tell the customer what happened. He starts throwing a fit for coming down here for nothing and us wasting his time. Well, I tell him this is something that can happen and we are already very generously trying to restore his data for him. Agree with him that we will handle the retrieval over the phone and go about my lunch break. The scan isn't done by the time I head home so I call him to inform him that we'll need to do this the day after. When I get in the following morning the PC is off again. What the hell, it just installed updates the other day, this shouldn't happen. Turns out there was a blackout during the night. !@#!$@, start another retrieval. This one is done later in the day so I call up the dude:  \n&gt;**$me:** Hey I have your data in front of me but the actual retrieval process takes a very long time. You said you know exactly where the files you needed are located. Could you specify me where so I can try to create a backup of them?  \n**$customer:** Oh that's pretty easy. They're in my user folder under Downloads/torrents.  All I need is the movies from there, I kinda don't want to download them again.\n\n*facepalm*\nWhilst I scroll down to the folder to see if there's any non-pirated content in there I ask him if he's aware that I can't be assisting users acquire illegally obtained files. He said there probably was a slim chance I would and that his important uni/work documents were backed up anyways so it is all fine.  \nWell not all fine by me. You've wasted my time multiple times across multiple days for some illegal files you probably could and would have downloaded again the next day? I'm not having any of this. I calmly inform the user that I can't assist in retrieving these files and that he can come pick up his disk the day after tomorrow. I start a zero write on the disk, ensuring this data is actually gone (company policy).  \nNow I'm not done yet. As the university is also its own ISP, we get a lot of DMCA and copyright violation claims. We do take these seriously and send users found in violation of Copyright Infringement mails informing them of their actions. After 3 strikes you're out, and your account will be disabled until you've written a formal apology letter which states you will never, ever, violate copyright law on the university again. If you are found in violation again your entire university account will unconditionally be suspended until the end of the next semester (which can range from 6-10 months).  \nAfter talking to my supervisor, informing him of $customer's behavior and him wasting so much of our time for his 'important data retrieval', he agrees with me to submit the user for review by the committee handling these cases. We also got to immediately disable his account, as per university rules people undergoing review by the committee are not allowed to connect to our networks until the case is reviewed.",

        "text": "The idea that the network, and by extension his job, existed to facilitate the business of the college and the day to day work of the students, staff and faculty at $MidwestCollege was utterly lost on $Red. $Red's job existed so his kids could get an education at the school. The fact that hundreds of people depended on the facilities he managed to get their work done was way down in the list below his kid's education, his paycheck, and his vacation time.\n\nAs you know, when troubleshooting complex issues, especially computer things, you need to kind of move in a step-by-step process, eliminating potential causes as you go and avoid \"jumping around\" to avoid going down the wrong path and making a bad assumption. Not so with $Red. His troubleshooting method was like watching a meth-addled monkey at work. He leapt from potential cause to potential cause with the frequency of a cheap ham radio, regardless of other information or clear indications to the contrary.. He'd be troubleshooting a data-link layer problem, a bad cable or fiber GBIC, and then he'd suddenly decide, no, its a transport layer issue. And of course, because he'd had only a cursory grasp of how these things worked (remember the DHCP server?), often I swear it was like he was using a dartboard to make decisions.\n\n$Red didn't like tools, either. Like Nessus or MRTG. Nothing that gave him any status of traffic or whatever. I think because it required knowledge and skill he didn't have, or he didn't know how to interpret the information and it would make him look stupid to admit that.\n\nBack in those days, spyware was just becoming a thing, and a lot of the stuff that the students got on their systems when off-campus would create a lot of broadcast traffic on the network while it tried to do its thing (this was after $Red \"flattened\" the network into one gigantic subnet, but before we implemented the new switches and NAC system), $Red had no way to determine the actual source of any broadcast traffic using traffic graphs or packet counts or whatever, but even if he did, he'd likely have refused to use them. \n\nOne day, I'd been at the college maybe 2 months or so, and the network was getting beaten up by a broadcast storm. The Help Desk had lit up with people not being able to get to servers, etc. The problems seemed to be moving across the campus. I went over to the NOC to see if $Red knew what was going on and maybe had a handle on it. My confidence in this was low, of course, based on his track record so far. \n\nI open the door to the NOC and there's $Red, on one side of the NOC, standing in front of the core switch, looking over his shoulder at his laptop visible thru the door into his office.\n\n\"What the..?\" was my first thought.\n\nSure enough: $Red's method to isolate a broadcasting computer was to login to the traffic management appliance (a device we'll call a $PayloadAdjuster) and find the source IP address of the broadcast traffic. Then, not having any interest or desire in using any management tools that would ID the location of that source IP on the network (ie. switch and port), he would just start a continuous ping of the offending IP from his laptop, open the door to the MDF in the NOC (20 ft from his desk) and pull each of the campus fiber link connections from the core switch until the IP until he got a \"no reply\" message. \n\n_This_ was his method of narrowing down which building on campus the offending device was located in. \n\nApparently, sometimes, $Red would then call the Help Desk and get a tech to dispatch, or he'd just grab his laptop himself, head for the offending building, and do it all over again with the Ethernet cables on the switches in the building until the process narrowed it down to a specific port.\n\nI had no idea this was his \"method\" and I was completely horrified.\n\nOf course, never mind the people trying to get actual *work* done in some building. Here's $Red just randomly interrupting their connectivity at the NOC. Normally, if it was just web browsing or connectivity to Outlook, not that big of a deal. \n\nBut the client for our Student Information System (talking to Oracle) didn't survive connectivity outages *at all*. Too bad if you were in the ERP at the time. People would be working along and *boom,* $Red would pull the fiber to their building and \"so long!\"  \n\nEven worse, when $Red plugged the fiber back in and moved on to the next building, the user would try to login again, they'd get an \"account in use\" error of some sort because their session was unexpectedly interrupted in Oracle and still hanging open. Then the Oracle team would have to get involved and kill the user's original session so they could login again. But this would entail 2-3 phone calls back and forth between the user, the help desk, the Oracle team, etc. Multiply that by however many people were actively using Oracle in just the Admin building and you can imagine the Help Desk would get pretty resentful when $Red used this \"troubleshooting\" method on a random Monday morning.\n\nI finally convinced him there were probably better ways to go about this than just yanking fiber, but that was quickly overtaken by the NAC project wth all the new switches, VLANs and the NAC management interfaces. The NAC system would monitor for \"top talkers\" and other anomalous behavior next to automagically. It would flag a port using too much bandwidth or putting out too many packets and would shut it down and move it to a quarantine VLAN and then alert $Red. Who would promptly ignore the alerts. \n\nEven after the NAC came on line, $Red refused to take ownership of anything. The Help Desk would call \"We have a guy who says he got kicked off the network..\" (ie. due to being put into the VLAN quarantine) and $Red would refuse to look up the computer in the NAC interface. He'd just say \"User issue. Don't bug me\" and hang up the phone.\n\nYeah, probably 35% of my job running the support side of the house was mitigating conflicts between $Red &amp; my Help Desk or $Red &amp; the rest of the user community.\n\ntl;dr  $Red's troubleshooting technique was reminiscent of the this guy: https://imgur.com/a/vkngr",

For some reason it seems as though the router isn't passing the requests on. I'm not too sure why. I think we're going to set them up on 4G for the interim. \n\nI relay this to $Customer and $CustomerManager. Nonetheless this is all fun, so I trace down the IT room with all our IT gear. It's a mess. A literal dive. I poke around and pretend like I know what I'm doing. I look around and all the internet's back up and running, so whatver.\n\n&gt; $L1: Hey $Manager, internet's working. $L3 has some news to relay to you. \n\n&gt; $Manager: Do you know what's happening? Our Nagios instance isn't complaining of anything going down. \n\n&gt; $L1: No, not a clue. \n\n*Yeah look, I'm not a wordsmith.*\n\nAn hour passes, and it's lunch time. I shoot over to the business as there is a cafe there as well. I get my lunch and decide to walk over to the IT room and take some pictures. \n\n&gt; $Customer: Hi $L1, have you got our s*i* fixed yet? Not sure why you guys are taking so long to fix it. I bet it's something stupid.\n\n*You're darn right it is....*\n\nI then watch as $Customer unplugs the router, and plugs in his kettle. \n\n....he's brewing some tea.\n\n&gt; $L1: $Customer, have you ever realised when you do this, the internet goes down?\n\n&gt; $Customer: Nope. I don't think about it, that's your job.\n\nAmazed, it makes sense. I realise that perhaps to 5 minutes to boil, and 10 minutes to get the internet back up and running. I watch and sure enough, that's what happens. \n\n&gt; $L1: Hi $CustomerManager, I think I've found the issue. I think $Customer unplugs the IT gear to make a tea. The internet goes down when he does this. Is it possible we could make sure he doesn't do this for a few days until we can prove it?\n\n&gt; $CustomerManager: Is he making Lipton or Tetley?\n\nYeah, you heard it right. He was more concerned about the tea. Nevertheless, this was a great eye opener for me. Still unsure why Nagios wasn't reporting the router going down (think the refresh was too delayed) and why no-one checked the uptime, but knew there were much bigger fish to fry at the time.\n",

Because of some logistics issues the tech lead and I were managing tech from a staging lock up and an outpost (literally a closet nearer the convention rooms).  About midday during the first day I was tired of having to go to ops to access the lockup or being one man down because someone has to babysit the room.  At one point the room was unlocked and we didn’t have access to the keys to lock it.  Luckily we had some chains and masterlocks in tech.  The tech lockup had two sets of doors. I made sure one set was locked by the hotel key and I chain and masterlocked the other set of doors with some curious congoers looking on.\n\nThe next day, Saturday of con.  Saturdays are always hard on me because I usually wander into tech 2 to 3 hours before my shift due to my OCD not letting me just let the morning staff carry on as is.  I plant myself in the lawnchair I brought from home and take up my usual roll of manging the flow of equipment and chitchatting with the tech staff that stop in between rounds of convention rooms.  That evening, the party block is in full swing.\n\n&gt;PS:  Public Safety to tech.\n\n&gt;Me: Tech outpost.\n\n&gt;PS: You guys know your room is unlocked right?\n\n&gt;Me: Shit.  No.  Stay there.\n\nI look at the walkie talkie in horror.  We have over 5,000 dollars in equipment unguarded in a room in which only two convention staff members have a key, me to the masterlock and the logicists manager with the hotel key.  Logicists manager would have more of a hissy fit over any missing equipment than me and that’s saying something.\n\nI fish into my lawnchair for the key and the extra masterlock I stored there.  I then pull another chain from one of my boxes.  When I stand up I look over to the tech person that had walked into the room.\n\n&gt;Me:  Hope you don’t mind, you’re in charge of the closet.\n\nI start briskly walking through the convention center and hotel all the while cursing whatever hotel staff member thought it was a good idea to come around and unlock a room we booked when we had it locked for more than half the convention.  \n\nThe party block was between me and my destination.  There I was a tech geek in a staff shirt walking in a huff through a hall full of drunk or near drunk people with a six foot chain over my shoulder.  I got more than one curious look sent my way.\n\nTL:DR-  Hotel staff pisses off the tech equipment babysitter justifying both sixfoot chains in the tech staff possession.",

Did I mention behind that control panel is an entire wing of manufacturing, just sitting there waiting for this to be finished.\n\nSo I get started and have to sit on the factory floor, they don’t have any chairs to be had.    It smells of oil and usual manufacturing waste.  I guess they do a lot of plastics processing.  So we get the ISA card installed and get it booting.  Installed the program and we hooked it up to the machine.  Then began the bumbling around the program because I’m just a service tech, not a technician specializing in this craziness.\n\nThen I somehow get it sort of working, but in flipping through the massive binder of documentation, I find the little tidbit saying, oh BTW, this program only works with DOS 3.3 or 4.01.  Now I had DOS floppies stashed that were version 6.22!  Do you know how hard it is to find that old of DOS disks or even the bootable iso or image?  Well sure you do, this wouldn’t be Tales From Tech Support without it being insanely difficult to solve this insanity.\n\nSo I go back and forth from my work to the clients company about 4 times (hurrah for paid mileage) because I need floppy disks and floppy drives.  I also grabbed some more hard drives because why not, don’t want to go back and forth too many times.  On one of those trips, I had the idea to try pulling all the data from the client’s original hard drive.  This is using that 486 computer I picked up yesterday.\n\nSo I get back to the company and start digging into the 486 computer and hooking up the original hard drive.  After some fiddling, I get that sucker recognized and boot into DOS 6.22.  Miraculously, it recognized the original drive and actually had all the information still on it.  I copied it over and finally had some concrete progress to show the client.\n\nUnfortunately, I was there for a total of 4 and a half hours and that the best progress was getting the hard drive info off.  The rest of the time was used up trying, unsuccessfully to get a DOS image that was bootable using floppies.  Yeah not easy... at least not for me.  Anyway, after finishing up at the clients, I went back to work and worked with my head technician to get a damn bootable DOS floppy working.  Only 45 minutes after we closed.\n\nMy brain has been working overtime thinking of how to make all this crap work and get a massive positive review from this company.  As of right now, my next idea is to try loading a newer program with XP or 98 and getting everything interfaced.  I have the program and now just have to wait till Monday to go on another on-site.  \n\nThanks for the support on the first post!  Part 3 will be coming on Monday night or Tuesday night.  Who knows how many days these on-sites will go on for.  Probably like a week or so.  A week of being stressed out of my mind, but in a good way.",

Trust in the people that use these computers is currently at 0 and has led to the workstations being frozen with Deepfreeze and locked down to the point where they can only access one URL and print to a local Zebra printer. \n\nWhen a label printer goes down, it is a semi big deal as that is all these computers do. \n\nMe: Guy dude that does work\n\nUser: Gung ho screwdriver user\n\nI'm at the office and I get an email from this company saying label printer is down so I head onsite and take a look. I try to print a label and notice the platen roller is spinning freely and not catching the labels, causing nothing to shoot out.

        "text": "I was responding to a post over in r/askReddit, and felt that some of the nuance might be lost. So I'm posting it here.\n\nAt a former job, I wasn't the employer, but I was the one the company owner deferred to for selection during the hiring process. He wanted me to assist in hiring some front-end devs for a start-up, and he had no clue what he was doing (full disclosure, I was really young and didn't know either). So I created a simple exam for applicants to complete so that we could gauge their skill set. The base requirement was an understanding of XHTML (yes, the platform we built required all front-end docs to be XHTML compliant).\n\nThe exam itself was all about creating a mock-up website within a limited time frame. I did this to gain a better understanding of how the applicant worked under pressure, since the job was extremely stressful with multiple deadlines *daily*. From the start of the exam, we inform the applicant that there is no expectation that they will complete the exam, and nothing that they create during the course of the exam will be used for anything aside from their application.\n\nWithin the first week of interviewing front-end developers, *I get* a strange email from a woman out of state. Living about 1,500 miles away. I am not the point of contact, so I initially forward the email to the company owner. He responds by letting me know that he had given her my information, that he had pre-interviewed her, and he thought she was a great fit. From 1,500 miles away. For a position that required someone physically on site.\n\nSo I sat and read, and re-read this woman's email. \n\nThe first half was her life-story, talking about her husband and kids. It just sort of rambled on, and from the way she wrote, you could feel her desperation bleeding through the screen. \n\nThe second half was a quick description of what should have been a resume. She briefly talks about her professional experience with about 4 or 5 different companies, but only gives the correct information for one. I do a quick cross-check and view the company website. Honestly, I've seen better Geocities sites in the late 90's and this one only worked half as well. View source, and it's evident to me that this was a copy + paste job as well. \n\nI go back to the owner and tell him I don't recommend continuing the application process with this woman. He insists that she's the diamond in the rough, that I should go ahead and schedule her for a phone interview and set up the exam for her to perform remotely. \n\nOkay then. I spend time over the next few days setting up a desktop off our internal network that she can remote in to. I send her a detailed list of instructions to follow for initiating the process, assume that this whole thing is going to be hassle, so I pad the usual half hour window with an hour start and hour finish and notify her that she should set aside 3 hours in total. Sure enough, she calls me so I can confirm that we're able to connect via VPN to the testing platform and that she's able to access the exam correctly, but it takes a solid 45 minutes of hand holding before I'm able to start the test. \n\nDuring that period of time, her demeanor starts to switch from being grateful for the opportunity, to why the hell did we make this so difficult. Right, because I had to go through assisting her with installing and setting up the VPN software we used, and it was evident from the get go that she hardly knew her way around a computer. So I remain patient, bide my time, and finally we have a solid VPN connection. The desktop she's remoted into is running Windows Vista (yeah, guess how many years ago this was) and had only the Adobe Creative Suite installed. Her instructions were to use Dreamweaver (preferred, but Notepad was also acceptable) to construct a simple template in XHTML using the guidelines I sent her, and she could access any of the other programs to create additional elements. She had half an hour to create one page.\n\nThe test begins, and I hang up. \n\nI keep an eye on her screen and the timer while I work on other things. At the thirty minute mark, I check in. She's got Notepad and Dreamweaver opened on the desktop. All that she's managed to input is the HTML document tag. At this point, I'm not surprised. I figure she abandoned the test and left the connection open because she doesn't know how to close it. I take over the desktop and proceed to start closing the programs when my phone rings.\n\nHer voice rings through the other end, louder and clearer than a bell. \"HEY! I WAS WORKING ON THAT!\" \n\nShe caught me off guard, so it takes a moment to gather my wits. I calmly explain that the exam is only 30 minutes long. She, again, pleads with me. Starts off with \"but I thought I had 3 hours\" and ends with \"but I was almost done.\" Truthfully, I know that this isn't going to end well, and it's lunch time for me. After a few minutes of pretending to be a hard ass, I give in and say she has another hour. She thanks me, hangs up, and I head off to lunch.\n\nWhen I return, I log back into the machine the exam is housed on, and the screen looks *identical* to the way it did when I left. I screencap the desktop as she's left it, kill the VPN connection, and start to compose an email to the owner. Sure enough, she calls me about 15 minutes later.\n\nAt first she tells me that there's something wrong with the connection and that she's been trying to reconnect for the past five minutes. I tell her that her hour was up 15 minutes ago, and the machine has been offline for at least that long. She then changes her story and blames the connection speed. I told her that she has 30 minutes to send me *any* html document that fits the parameters of the exam. Again, hangs up. I fire off my email to the owner, acknowledging that I gave her one last chance to redeem herself - just incase there was a technical issue. \n\n30 minutes later, I get a nearly empty html document with empty header, body, and table tags. In her poorly-typed email she claims that \"she's done it\" and that I should be more than happy with the free labor I've squeezed out of her. \n\nWith glee, I forward the email, untouched, to the owner. I could hear the resounding \"What the-\" from his office down the hall when he opened it. I don't even bother waiting for a reply. I head to his office and we have an amusing chat about this applicant.\n\nNext day, he sent her a rejection email. It was polite and professional, and we thought it was the end of it. Three days later, she calls back, screaming and yelling at the owner for rejecting her. 3 days. After the email. How often does she check her email? \n\nShe fluctuated between fits of anger and pleading for *another* chance. She accused me of all kinds of things, blamed technology, even blamed her husband for not taking her kids on the day of the exam, and so on. \n\nOwner gave her a warning, told her not to contact the company again. Idiot woman proceeded to call and harass us for the next week or so, before it finally stopped.\n\nThe owner learned his lesson and handed full-control of hiring applicants over to me. Had the positions filled within another week, no additional problems.",

However, the powers that be decided to queue my team to assist with inital call overflow because we are too efficient right now.\n\nAbout a year the auto populate feature broke. It has always had a temper and for the esclation teams already had a 50/50 shot of displaying an internal number. Now it had decided that 2 out of every 3 auto populated calls were all located in the same state; right account number and pin but wrong state code (and not even the state of our office or corporate).\n\nWith the auto-populate mostly useless, I wasn’t too concerned when five months ago I changed desks and the feature wasn’t working on my computer.\n\nAbout a month ago, I finally submitted a ticket, and set it to low priority. The ticket asks when and how I would be available. I only indicate im. I give my work days and when my shift starts and ends indicating my time zone.\n\nThe next day, a day off, I check my work email and there is an email advising me that I didn’t include a phone number so they could call me to address the issue that day.\n\nThe day after I come into work and an email stating I hadn’t replied to the first email. I reply that I don’t have a work number and reiterated my hours.\n\nA week later, I mention in passing the issue to a deskside guy. He said he would look into it. My guess is he forgot. I don’t want to add to his work load, and he already calls me “Care bear” for an incident two years ago.  \n\nNow we come to the current week. It is Thursday and I get an initial tier call.\n\n&gt;Cranky: My internet isn’t working.\n\n&gt;Me: I’m sorry your internet isn’t working, what is your phone num-\n\n&gt;Cranky:  I already told your damn system that information. Your modem isn’t working.  Why?\n\n&gt;Me:  I need your information to find that out sir. What is your phone number?\n\n&gt;Cranky:  Can’t you see?  I already gave it to you.\n\n&gt;Me:  Sir I am just trying to help you get back up and running, I need your phone number because I have a computer issue and my machine won’t display that information.\n\n&gt;Cranky:  Oh so your company can’t even get their own service working.\n\n&gt;Me: No, it is not our service, it is a different company issue with my computer.\n\n&gt;Cranky:  So your company doesn’t even trust its own internet to let you use it. Tell me when I drop your service who should I go with, who are you using?\n\n&gt;Me:  N-no sir. That is not what I said at all. I am currently on a gigabit connection with $mycompany. My computer has a problem, as in my machine, Microsoft. I really want to help you; can you please just give me your phone number.\n\nHe gives it to me.  After being cranky at me for not accepting “the account holder” as an answer for who I am talking with and getting an earful for asking him for his pin, I get him through power cycling his modem and router. His router just didn’t have a valid IPv4.\n\nThe next day, I pull up my it ticket and it is still open. I add an additional comment stating the issue is not resolved and affected a call. IT pops up soon after asking if I am free to have the issue looked at.\n\nI watch the remote person clearing my temp files and it looks like she might have emptied my trash folder. I sigh, chalking it down to policy. After she is done with the routine maintenance steps, I can tell from the down time she is finally checking my profile credentials and software.  \n\n&gt;IT: You don’t use *$phonesoftwareXXA*\n\n&gt;Me: I do use *$phonesoftwareXX* to take calls\n\nI show her the folder for *$phonesoftwareXX*. Most of our machines have 2 files in this folder. Agents are advised to only use *$phonesoftwareXXA* However, both are near identical files, and most agents just call the entire system including the physical phones *$phonesoftware*. I only have file *$phonesoftwareXXB*.\n\n&gt;IT: You don’t have *$phonesoftwareXXA* on your computer.\n\n&gt;Me:  Yeah, well that’s probably the problem. \n\n&gt;IT: Let me install it for you.\n\nI walk over to my manger’s office.  He is chatting with our director.\n\n&gt;Me: I’m going to need a compliance exception for computer issues (this has to come from manger not supervisor).  IT just spent thirty minutes clearing my temp files and such only to tell me that *$phonesoftwareXXA* was missing the entire time. I told her that is probably the problem.\n\n&gt;Director: *chuckling*. Probably.  It’s Friday, the 13th.\n\nTL:DR- Cranky customer leads me to me being a little bit more of a problem child than usual.",

        "text": "We took on a small business client to do a migration to 365 for them. They had been running off of a SBS 2003 server, MS was really pushing for it to be gone at this point. The company had also recently been moving to more of a roaming user setup, so moving to cloud hosting was going to be a more appropriate anyway. We had got the migration mostly done at this point and the ageing server was down to a 'just there for roll-backs' role.\n\nThis occurs soon after company files had been moved. The server was shut off for a scream test to ensure nothing it was doing was needed any-more.\n\n---\n\nThe client calls up looking to gain access to a file that they were thinking had been missed. We had left the server there as-is so they could just turn it back on if there was some urgent problem. However at some point someone wanted a network connection so the cable to the server's Ethernet cable had been unplugged.\n\n**Client** asked if it would be ok if they could do it to prevent us coming out. Nice and simple, if they plug it back in and turn the box back on, it would be fine.\n\n&gt; **Me**: Just make sure to plug it in to the socket at the bottom add-in card. The top socket appears to be broken.\n\n&gt; **Client**: Ok, give me a sec.\n\nA few seconds pass.\n\n&gt; **Client**: Umm, how far in should it go?\n\nWhat?\n\n&gt; **Me**: Err.. it should just click, not go in.\n\n&gt; **Client**: Oh.\n\nGreat, I organised to go out, they weren't that far away.\n\n---\n\nI get there to see **Client** is the only one in the office, I can find a bit more about what happened. I pick up the server and put it on the desk so I can inspect it. The server was a little ml110, a nice workhorse of small businesses, but is basically a desktop case with a server components in. Looking at the back of the server there is nice square hole where I was expecting an Ethernet socket.\n\nWhelp, with no networking we will have to use a USB drive. I ask **Client** if they had a USB hard drive. They did and asked if I can put all the files on to it anyway, they don't want have to turn on the server again later.\n\nI nicked the connections for the desk I was on and booted up the server so I can start the copy. It's quite slow, and without networking windows has to wait for a bunch of services to fail. Being nosy and wanting something to do while windows boots, I decided to open up the case so I can look at the damage that **Client** did to the network adapter. Being that **Client** is not techy, they wanted to see inside as well, so they hover near by.\n\nFirst thing I noticed is how much dust there was. It had apparently been running behind a desk on the floor for a long time. It's a carpeted room so the dust is not that surprising then.\n\nI (carefully) reach in and pick up the Ethernet socket. It had been completely broken off the add-in card, I guess they pushed a bit too hard. I turned to show **Client**, but something else had caught their eye.\n\n&gt; **Client**: What's this?\n\nTheir hand starts reaching into something inside the server.\n\nSomething Pink.\n\nI don't stop them for two reasons. They own the server, they can break it if they want (they already did,) and I realised what they were reaching for.\n\nSlowly out comes a brown grey box with some pink patches visible through the dust. It's about 3 inches wide. We weren't aware of any USB backup being setup.\n\n&gt; **Me**: That's an external Hard Drive.\n\n&gt; **Client**: Would that we where our data is?\n\n&gt; **Me**: I'm sure it must be for backups.\n\nI logon to the server after it boots up and take a look at any backup programs. None are setup to go to a USB Hard Drive. I take another look at My Computer and all the company files are on a D: drive.\n\nI then try to eject any USB devices.\n\nThe D: drive disappears.\n\nOh.\n\nI unplug the drive and give it a big blow. I then pass the now almost completely hot pink box to $Client.\n\n&gt; **Client**: That was quick!\n\nYes. Yes it was.\n\n---\n\nTLDR: Client breaks server network port, leads to discovery that company data had been running off of a consumer external hard drive.",

        "text": "Sorry if this isn't the right space for my post - most of this is computer related.\n\nI work for a large brand-name phone company on the technical assistance/repair sides of things (we double as a retail store) where it's mostly just either booking in phones/tablets for repairs, troubleshooting software issues or just general advice because people don't know how to google things.\n\nWe operate through both pre booked and walk in appointments according to how many people we have staffed on during the day. We're a very opened planned store, with service desks at the back. We do have a concierge at the front who is meant to try and catch every customer who comes in store so they don't just slither towards the back and stand there wondering why no one has helped them but sometimes due to it being ridiculously busy they just can't and customers will take it into their own hands to get served.\n\nI was with a customer already helping her try and find some photos she deleted from both her phone and cloud storage for whatever reason (ended up finding them, anyway) when this older, dishevelled looking man ignores all our floor staff who greet him and comes straight up to the side of my desk, where I'm clearly busy. My initial thought is oh, he must be her husband or dad or something, so I smile at him and say hi and continue what I'm doing for a second before he coughs/grunts and puts his hands on my desk and my customer looks at both of us really confused. \n\n**Me**: oh! Sorry, I thought you were together. Do you need help?\n\n**Man**: Well yeah, this IS technical assistance right???\n\nI apologise to my customer and jump up from my seat to begin walking towards our concierge who is looking equally as confused - she thought he was my customer from before, or that he was also with my current customer - and explain to him that we are by appointment only but we can see if we have any free slots to fit him into.\n\nHe's not happy and starts sighing and grunting and keeps repeating \"this is the only time I've gotten off work\" over and over when I say yes, I know, but we have other people who have been waiting who have made appointments online or have been waiting for ages in store. \n\nHis phone isn't turning on, which means we can't extract data from it (privacy laws and we're not trained in it) and we're a 24hr turnaround time but can give him something to use in the meantime. We just need to book him in first.\n\nOur next appointment is in only twenty minutes so I'm glad, concierge is glad, but he's absolutely furious. He starts yelling and arguing with me about how \"it's the only time I get off work!\" and \"I'm a busy man, just serve me now!\"\n\n**Me**: I get that, really, but I'm obviously busy at my job too. As soon as I'm done I'll be able to grab your details and give you a phone to use in the meantime.\n\n**Man**: WHY CAN'T YOU JUST TAKE MY PHONE NOW? *he pushes it into my hands* SEE? YOU ALREADY HAVE IT???\n\n**Me**: *tries giving it back but he's got his arms folded* Because I'm busy, and the rest of our technical staff are busy, so you're either going to have to wait for twenty minutes or we can make an appointment for another day. \n\n**Man**: WELL YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW IT OUT THEN SINCE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HELP ME NOW\n\n**Me**: I would rather not because it's got your sim and memory card, take it and make an appointment for another day\n\nHe keeps his arms folded and nudges the phone in my hands towards me again with his elbow.\n\n**Me**: Okay, well I have a recycling bin for phones just down the back and if you're happy recycling your belongings that's fine with me.\n\nI take one step towards the back of the store and he snatches it out of my hands.\n\n**Man**: I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW BUSY I AM. I RUN ALL THE THEATRES IN *CITY*. WE'RE RUNNING HARRY POTTER. **HARRY F---ING POTTER!!!**\n\nso yeah he left with those parting words and I got to go back and find photos and have a laugh with my customer who had booked an appointment weeks in advance.

Today we made a copy of our database; we'll convert one copy, and the other is read-only for a week.\n\nI noticed a few minutes ago that I had an e-mail from half-a-day ago, from one of our European superusers. He said his account was inactive and he couldn't log in.\n\nNow, I've been busy today. We had to coordinate some communications and other things related to setting up a new database space, getting production shut down, copying the database, setting up messages alerting people to the database being (about to go|currently) down, which had some other problems because of problems we've had for weeks with some internal hosting...you get the idea.\n\nBusy.\n\nSo I just now saw this e-mail. I'm not even on the front-line for support, there's a layer between it and me. And I noticed it was hours old.\n\nWell, I *really* enjoyed my opening paragraph about how e-mailing me was not the right way to get support, especially for an account issue in production. I got to point out that we had another way to start support questions that he should have used. I also get sick, go on vacation, or get so busy I can't get to my messages for a long time.\n\nThen I checked and his account was...fine. That superuser account hadn't been inactive in any way. I speculated that a patching process the night before might have made some connections lag, so it looked like he couldn't log in to his superuser account.\n\nThen I got to tell him that we were read-only for the next week...and part of that involved shutting down the superuser login screen. That was just the cherry on top.\n\n\"You won't be able to check if the account works for ten more days...\"\n",

        "text": "Yesterday I'm basking in the glow of finishing my big background task and eating lunch when a VP walks by on his way out (at 2PM, jealous) and says \"You're it for the afternoon.  Take a look at this ticket when you're finished\"\n\nWell, I'm just heading back in and in my inbox there's a new email.\n\n&gt; From: $UserAdmin\n\n&gt; Subject: Files Disappear after Sync\n\nMy inner Midwesterner immediately goes 'uff da'.  My less-inner Californian just starts swearing.  So I sigh.  Wonderful.  There's a second email chain from my boss and the VP suggesting the issue - they're all small things.  I've a couple ideas myself too and suggest a WebEx before turning back to a cronjob script I'd been neglecting.\n\nA half hour later this urgent issue gets a response suggesting right then for a meeting.  Sure, why not, let's get this done.  Two minutes later I'm on the WebEx waiting to get going, and 15 minutes later we start.\n\nSince rule 1 is users lie, I figured I wanted to reproduce everything, so I check against the server for what's supposed to be there:\n\n    File(s) not in client view\n\nShit.  That's less simple.  The VP and my boss suggested somebody deleted the files or had them checked out exclusively.  So much for that.  Let's check out the client view ... aaaand it's huge.  WebEx is stuck too.  Why the hell is it so slow?  Moving down one line every 10 seconds, I find the view line that says things should be working and double check it.  It's right.  Checklist time:\n\n  * I'm going against the right server?  Yup.  \n  * Port's right?  Yes it is. \n  * Services are running? Yeah\n  * Rest of the client spec is right?  Oh.  Oh no.  Dear god.\n\nJust above the screen I see the issue - somebody mapped all the chip design data to a subdirectory.  What happens when you try to map the same directory twice?  The higher-priority one takes over, and the one on top is higher priority.  Clearly somebody was manually editing their workspace, so let's force override this.  Get permission from the user to (potentially) kill any changes they haven't submitted and do the override.  Check the client spec again.  It's still there.  \n\nAs a quick aside - this is not supposed to be possible, as far as I know. I'm a server maintainer primarily.  \n\nWe are out of my wheelhouse, so it's time to look at the server and the metadata there.  Unfortunately for me, the saved client-spec looks good (it turned out WebEx caught up really fast and skipped a full page of lines with the bad one.  i think).  The individual client spec had the issue.  Alright time to get expert help (i.e. my boss) ... and he says I should do exactly what  I just did.\n\nAfter another hour of struggling to verify things are working correctly (spoiler, they are) and noticing there looks to be two lines with the exact same spec, we realize those two lines are slightly different and the bad one doesn't seem to exist the same way in metadata.\n\nOpen the administrative GUI, what do we see?  Two libraries (glorified spec lines) almost identical but different colors.   Of course the bad one is a funny color, and I'm sitting here wondering why that is.  I bring in my boss again, and he groans.  He knows exactly what this is: it's a library to pull data in from another unrelated server.  The problem?  Some chucklenuts mapped to the local one and labeled it 'test'.  He must have wanted to try this out (I think) and managed to break a team's workspaces and delete all their work from that day.\n\nFrom that point, it's a two minute edit to get things working and another three to send an email telling everybody to please re-sync and make sure the rest of all the design data gets deleted before it fills your hard drive.\n\nI need to see if there's a way to prevent that in future :/\n",

But instead of filing a ticket, of course it was a direct email to a manager. And of course it said things like \"Fix this NOW or else WORKMANS COMP!\" I can understand claims being filed for things like carpal tunnel, but a blank desktop wallpaper background?! When you can just maximize an app to fill the background?!\n  \n\n\nInitially this was puzzling, because the coworkers in this office had perfectly working backgrounds that were fine. So, researched Group Policies in AD and found out the windows 7 boxes worked since they had the background stored locally, but the new windows 10 ones didn't. Time to update everyone with a new GPO! Or at least once it gets approved. \n  \n\n\nA hilarious side note, while researching this, came across 15 year old background that was 95% eye popping neon bright GREEN, except for the logo. And even that was poorly done like a MS Paint fill operation, with bits and pieces of white hanging out. Now if that was implemented instead of a blank wallpaper, I would believe reports of going blind and workers comp, after just a few seconds of checking it out my eyes were weird. :) \n\n  \n\nTL;DR Briefly had a fantasy of pushing neon green wallpaper with GPO.

        "text": "I used to be a TV Headend guy at a small telco.  We received most of our channels via satellite by way of a giant dish (5m x 10m).  It's cold here and it snows, so the dish had a de-icer system on the back to heat the dish so that the snow would melt off during the winter.  Unfortunately, it died and the manufacturer decided to replace it, in the middle of the coldest month of the year.  After two days of a lot of grunt work in the cold (that I thankfully didn't have to do personally) the new dish is in place and we're trying to get it working.  Nothing works at all, interference everywhere.  It's a disaster.  There's talk of putting the old broken dish back because at least it kind of works (which would be two more days of grunt work in the cold).\n\nMe and the two guys from the dish company are standing outside the headend talking about possible issues and how we can fix the new dish.  One of us just happens to notice this power cable running over to the dish.  It's coming from the giant truck that the old dish is currently sitting on.  Apparently it's an engine block heater because it's THAT cold out and the driver is anxious about not being able to start his truck again.\n\nI'm wondering at this point where exactly he's plugging it in because he's literally right next to a building on the other side of his truck with a power outlet right there.  I trace the wire back to the dish area and find that he's plugged it into a power outlet directly under the fuse box and the power conduit to the dish's heater goes right through that power outlet.\n\nI ask the dish guys if that would have anything to do with our issues.  They were really sure that there was no possible way our issues could be related to the block heater at all.  But, you know what... I'm thinking that it can't hurt to try ANYTHING before rebuilding something we know is broken.\n\nAs I yank out the power plug, all of a sudden we have crystal clear signal!  The day is saved... and all that.  Literally nobody but the three of us seem to care as it's just techies being excited about techie stuff.\n\nPost mortum was that \n\n1. when they installed the power for the dish, the electrician added an outlet on one of the three phases because the dish was far away from other power sources\n\n2. the other outlets available outside were all not working but nobody bothered to tell facilities so they could fix\n\n3. The driver asked where to plug in and someone told him \"anywhere you can find a plug that works\"\n\n4. the signal noise from the block heater was travelling through the power cable and into the heater in the dish and using the heater (just a resistance wire) as an antenna to broadcast a very weak signal (too weak to be picked up by our signal sweep but literally inside the antenna reflector)\n\n5. the dish is really good at picking up weak signals from its reflector (that's its job, after all)\n\nSo when your cable tv isn't working right you can wonder: did someone plug something in an outlet that they shouldn't have.",

        "text": "I figured I would post part one of this story since it happened yesterday and is currently ongoing.  Got a call from a new, potential customer.  They wanted to bring us an ancient industrial pc to repair.  The story is as follows:\n\nThe customer came in with the ancient dos computer (80486 processor inside) and it has a bad 84 mb hdd.  I tried using a 20gb hdd and dos installed fine it seemed, but the computer just won't boot.\n\nWe have another identical hard drive ordered, but it's gonna take a while. It's a company that needs this computer up and running. Single point of failure, no backups or spare parts.\n\nAssuming the ide controller only can recognize up to a cettain drive size, we trieda compact flash card and adapter with a 64 mb compact flash card. Again, Dos installed fine, but when it comes time to boot, the system just hangs at a bios info splash screen. \n\nIn another failed attempt to get it to boot DOS,  I had a coworker resize a hard drive using seatools to something like 82 mb.  This got a hard drive controller error instead of letting us install DOS.\n\nAlso, I tried having the customer use a junk Dell clams hell P.O.S. pentium 4 desktop (note: pos isn't point of sale in this case).  Turned out, what I thought was a serial port was just a breakout from what I thought was a parrelel port.  Curse companies that co-opt a standard plug and rewire it.\n\nThe plug is located on a proprietary ISA slot card for communicating with machinery.  The card has its own processor on it and everything.  And as a small computer store, we definitely wouldn't save anything close to a ISA slot error computer.  The only place we could find a replacement computer with an ISA slot is online.  A huge shipping charge later and we have to wait till that comes in Monday.\n\nThat's where I'm at so far.  It's a little nerve racking because I'm used to the largest repair bills being around $500.  The labor for all this will be in the thousands and the downtime for the company could be costing them big time.\n\nOverall, for my first huge, absolutely massive client, it's going pretty well.  The people from the company are receptive and understand the issues and hangups.  They want their production line up and running again, but aren't taking the slowdown out on me (for once).\n\nThis will only be part one of I don't know how many parts.  To wrap up, I'm in over my head, up s**ts creek without a paddle, and everyone is depending on me to support hardware that was made the same year I was and that I didn't know existed 24 hours ago.\n\nThat's my ramble.  Surprisingly coherent for being on my phone and writing this all on one go without stopping.  In about a half hour.  As always, editing/formatting/spelling mistakes, let me know.\n",

Great guy, but likes getting things done very fast. Has known me since I was a very young kid, and has watched me progress in the IT world from kid doing grunt work for his software developer/sometimes IT guy dad to a certified IT who even dad calls upon to consult when he runs into things he doesn't understand. \n\n$OM - our lovely office manager, whose job is to make sure that our salaried doctors are working and not just sitting there with nothing to do.\n\n$Admin - our administrator, hired by COO and his partners to oversee the day to day operations of the place.\n\nThe story: \n\n**D-day - 1**\n\n$COO has decided to upgrade our internet speed, which involves $majorisp sending in a tech, who needs to replace a modem. $COO schedules the tech to come in...the next day, letting $me know around 2 hours after I'd left for the day. Tech came in, saw this was a big job and he didn't have the right tools, and wanted to reschedule. Unfortunately, $majorisp has an absolutely idiotic policy for business clients: they don't install on weekends, and they only install from 8-5. Also, they give you a window in which they may...or may not show up, with no way to guarantee them showing up at a given time. Essentially, they force you to have downtime during working hours in order to have a service change. Fortunately, we have a backup line provided by $otherisp, regularly checked by me. The last test had been about 4 months ago, and it had worked perfectly.\n\nThat said, I ask to do a test of the backup before $majorisp's tech begins to work just to make sure we have internet, which I'm told I can't do now because we fear downtime, and that $COO wants this done the next day, as early as possible. $majorisp can show up from 8AM-11AM. Our center opens for business at 8:30, docs show up around 9 and by 9:45, all 3 main floors are packed with patients, and the billing and administration floors are packed with staff that need to work. I don't have a choice, so I agree to show up at 8, open the place, run the test, disconnect the old modem (so he can get to work faster) and wait for the tech. We explain to them that it is imperative that they show up at 8 as well, or this isn't getting done.\n\n\n**D-Day**\n\nI show up at 7:30, figuring I'll need the extra time to run the backup test. I open up, go to our server closet, and run the test: I turn off the main line, and see an immediate switch over to the backup, the way its supposed to. Great. I try to go online however, and...crap. It doesn't work. Thank you, Mr. Murphy. So I access the $otherisp modem to see what's going on, and lo and behold, it can't ping the $otherisp. Hook up a laptop directly to the modem, turn the modem off and turn it back on, etc. Nothing. Then I call $otherisp support. By now, it's getting close to 8 when $majorisp tech is supposed to show up, and I'm still on hold with $otherisp trying to get my backup to work. I've also called $mainisp and found out their tech is supposed to be in within an hour (before it gets crowded). Meanwhile my main line is off, in preparation for $majorisp to get there and do our upgrade. I finally get $otherisp's support on the line, and we start fixing the backup.\n\n\nIt's at this time, around 8:20, when staff has begun to file in and ask questions. There had been a downtime warning. So I'm on the phone with $otherisp, fixing my backup, my main line is down and $majorisp still hasn't show up, plus my phone is being blown up by confused department managers. All this means is that my conversation with $otherisp is taking forever because I have to keep switching lines as they all try to figure out what's happening. Finally, as me and $otherisp tech close in on what's causing the problem (around 9 now because he's been on hold a few times, and has a lot of company policy to follow) I get a call from $OM. I put $otherisp tech on hold, again.\n\n\n&gt;$OM: mf9769, I just came and doctor just came in. The internet's not working. Are you aware?\n\n&gt;$Me: Yes. I'm working on restoring service now.\n\n&gt;*begin plugging in main line, realizing that $majorisp isn't getting anything done today. This is a bit of a process as a lot of stuff is connected to that modem*\n\n&gt;$OM: No. We need it now.\n\n&gt;$Me: $OM...I'm working on it, wait. I need to finish up.\n\n&gt;$OM: No. Doctor needs to work now. *hangs up*\n\n\nBy this time, I've almost reconnected everything, $otherisp's tech is still on hold. Get call from $admin\n\n&gt;$Admin: MF9769! WHY IS THE INTERNET NOT WORKING! $OM CALLED ME AND SAID YOU TOLD HER TO WAIT. SHE CAN'T. WE CAN'T.\n\n&gt;$Me: Ok. I'm turning it back on. *reconnect last cables. 2 seconds later, internet is back up*\n\nBack to $otherisp. Fix backup line almost immediately, and go have a chat with $OM about what \"let me do my job means. And as for $majorisp...well, take a wild guess. In fact, you don't have to. Their tech never showed up.  \n\n**tl;dr**: isp's ridiculous service and a lack of planning up top becomes about 10 minutes of downtime during a rush, causing a panic and turning my morning into a Murphy's Law shitshow.  \n\n  \nedits: formatting",

Well... Garbage? Garbage. 2.0 of it was amazing, the backbone of the software is a SQL DB and the developers actually did some pretty good work.\n\nThen they got bought out by a bigger company.

To help reinforce that to an extent, 2.0 shows up in Task Manager as $original.exe and 3.0 shows up as $different.exe.\n\nWhat 3.0 did was take the SQL database and populated their own interface with it. Most of the components we can't edit (i.e. patient statements outside of what we put in for our name, address, phone, payment options, and whether we want the statement in detail or simple which makes for more headaches), even though it's basically a rehash of $WordProcessor in basically everything, but worse somehow.\n\nThat last bit of info ties into the \"fun\" issues I have with my $Manager.

Since our $Software was basically the re-invention of the wheel in a Windows-based environment, things just aren't fluid. $Manager is mostly in charge of pulling the surgical notes from the facilities we use and putting them into our system, however they all use different systems because being standardized isn't fun /s\n\nNormally, her work is easier said than done because our doctors sometimes electronically sign their notes at the hospitals. Most of our issues come from a surgical center that somehow makes it \"hard\" for our doctors to log in with their credentials off-site and in our office to edit or sign them. When the notes aren't signed, $Manager tries to copy and paste the original notes into our $Software and have the doctors electronically sign them on our end.\n\nThat leads us to today's \"short\":\n\nThe cast:  \n$Yorugata - A/R Manager, Medical Biller, and \"on-site IT support\" while going to school for a Bachelor's in Accounting.  \n$Manager - Nearly 70-year-old lady that has been working in healthcare for decades.\n&gt; **$Manager**: $Yorugata, can you help me with getting these notes into $Software?  \n&gt; **$Yorugata**: *Not again...* Sure. One second.\n\nGot up and made my way over to $Manger's desk and was watching over her shoulder for the n-th time that day thanks to other questions earlier in the day.\n\n&gt; **Manager**: I'm trying to copy these notes into $Software, but it either never works right or it doesn't keep the formatting.\n\nShe proceeds to right-click and Copy the .docx file from her desktop and goes back to $Software in RDP to right-click and looks for Paste.\n\n&gt; **$Yorugata**: Uh... $Manager, that's not how Copy &amp; Paste works. We've gone over this several times.  \n&gt; **$Manager**: But I've done it a few times, and even $Coworker has seen it happen.  \n&gt; **$Yorugata**: I'm not sure how that's even possible, but the chances of success are still closer to 0 than if you opened the file to Copy &amp; Paste from there.  \n&gt; **$Manager**: But it takes more time to open every file and do it that way.  \n&gt; **$Yorugata**: *Except it takes more time sitting around, trying to figure that out...Ahem.* Unfortunately that's what we're stuck with because of how $Software works and how Windows and Word work.\n\n$Manager proceeds to demonstrate her methods and attempts while we're talking, and I'm busy internally /facepalming each time she sits there for a solid minute looking or figuring out why Paste is still grayed out after copying. Finally she lets go of our mouse while pointing at her screens and I just casually take over her mouse.\n\n&gt; **$Yorugata**: I know you want to try and do things without taking extra steps, but unfortunately we're stuck with opening up the Word file, copying and pasting the body into $Software, go back to the Word file, open up the header, copy that, then go back to $Software and Edit Header to paste to get the formatting you want.  \n&gt; **$Manager**: Oh $Yorugata! You got the formatting to stick! I still wish there was a faster way and it takes me 5, 10 minutes to do things this way, but this might have to do. I'll probably get faster doing this after a while.  \n&gt; **Yorugata**: Yeah... Until the developers for $Software or Microsoft decide to re-invent the wheel again, we're stuck going this route. Or we can get the doctors to stop being lazy with their credentials or maybe go with a new software that isn't limiting and annoying like $Software?  \n&gt; **$Manager**: $Yorugata, you know as well as I do that those doctors won't change the way they do things since they've done it for so many years that way, and you know they don't want to spend more money to change software since they've put so much into $Software these last 6 years.  \n  \n  \n  \n**TL;DR**: Copying the actual .docx or .pdf (she has tried this multiple times, too) does not equal copying the text to paste into our $Software.\n\n**Note**: I do know and $Manager has shown me what she does that \"works\" is her copying the .docx file from File Explorer and pasting it into Word which basically opens it unformatted in her examples. Seen her try this with a few other files that just put a short cut to open it from Word.",

We found a good location and hired a bunch of pros to set up the hardware, they sent one of their \"best guys\".  It was in a collocation facility and the distance between the antenna on the roof and the other equipment in our cage was too far for copper so we were using RF -&gt; Fiber -&gt; RF transceivers to get the signal to the other equipment.  I'm helping the pro with the install and he's showing me how it all works as I'll be maintaining it later.  He's about to hook up the fiber jumper (which we had to special order because who uses FC to LC connectors...) when he stops for a second and says \"we should probably clean the connection first\" so I start digging out my fiber cleaning pen when I see him RUB THE FIBER END ON HIS SHIRT and then plug it in.     \n\n&gt; Me: \"Did you just rub that on your shirt???\"\n\n&gt; Pro: \"Yeah. It's a cheap way to clean the fiber, fiber cleaners are expensive.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"Ever have any problems with that?\"\n\n&gt; Pro: \"No, never... and I replace a lot of jumpers\"\n\n&gt; Me: (thinking to my self \"I bet you replace a lot of them...\") \"Well, I have my pen and I'd feel better if we cleaned the jumper again\"\n\n&gt; Pro: Grumpily \"suit yourself\"\n\nAfter he left, I spent like half a day scoping and cleaning everything.",

        "text": "So before we get started, this is my first story here so go easy on me xD. I work in government IT for my state, and the majority of our clientele is around 40-50 years old. It is pretty typical for the non-IT clients to not know anything about what a computer is and when I did desk-side support they always said the computer wasn't working and just flat out pointed to the monitor while the tower was off, just for an idea. Now, this is typically not the case with our IT department because it is expected that everyone knows something about computers and the software they use on a daily basis.  \n\n\nAnyway, just to give a little context... I work on a call center styled help-desk and I just started two weeks ago. For some reason my state hasn't moved away from using mainframes for mostly every application we have, so we have a fairly large production control and mainframe team to upkeep the nine mainframes we still use on a daily basis to run most of the vital applications for the state. So typically, we have at least one person on call continually for these mainframe systems in order to perform maintenance if necessary, and this is even more true since the weather hasn't been the best lately. \n\n\n$Me - Me ofc\n\n\n$User - The Mainframe Guy\n\n\n$RF - Request Fulfillment Service Desk Employee\n\n\n$C - Company I Work For\n\n\n*User calls in on Monday*\n\n\n$Me: \"Hello thank you for calling the $C service desk, my name is $Me, how may I assist you today?\"\n\n\n$User: \"The VPN servers are down.\"\n\n\n$Me: \"Hm, let me check on those, I haven't heard anything but it is always good to double check.\"\n\n\n$Me: *Checks on the status of the VPN servers*\n\n\n$Me: \"There doesn't appear to be any issues with the servers and I have not had any other reports of this issue. Do you mind if I remote in to take a look?\"\n\n\n$User: \"No there is a problem with the servers, it keeps telling me that the 'server authentication failed.'\"\n\n\n$Me: \"Well, let's just take a look just in case to make sure there isn't something wrong with the client and we will go from there.\"\n$User: \"Erm, fine... let me turn on the computer.\"\n\n\n$Me: \"Sounds good, just let me know when you are up and running, I have just sent you a remote control link via email.\" \n\n*Currently resting my head on my hand thinking that this is going to be another one of \"those\" users who knows nothing about computers*\n\n\n$User: \"Um, I can't login.\"\n\n\n$Me: \"You can't log into the computer or the VPN?\"\n\n\n$User: \"The VPN.\"\n\n\n$Me: *Thinking sarcastically like... \"Well, you came to me saying that you have a problem with the VPN so, what's changed?\"*\n\n\n$Me: \"Okay, well let's ignore that for now, you should still be able to receive emails from Outlook. Just open it up and follow the directions listed on the link in the email for (insert some web support client here).\"\n\n\n$User: *Opens up link and reads the directions out loud, more than loud enough that it bellows in my ear.* \"I can't find the run button.\" \n\n\n$Me: \"It is at the bottom of the browser window.\"\n\n\n$User: \"Oh okay, I didn't even notice that one.\"\n\n\n$Me: *Hanging my head in shame as the site has a picture of where to find it...*\n\n\n$Me: \"Alright I am going to connect to your computer to take a quick look here.\"\n\n\n$Me: *Looks at the computer's VPN client and notices the user is trying to connect to a totally different domain then the one he is meant to be connecting to.*\n\n\n$Me: \"Alright, can you try logging into the VPN on $domain?\"\n$User: \"Um, sure I guess, I don't see how this will make any difference.\" \n\n\n$Me: \"This is just a step to troubleshoot...\" *Before I even finish my statement I notice that the client immediately kicked him back.*\n\n\n$Me: \"Give me one moment, I am going to check on something.\" *Mutes microphone*\n\n\n$Me: *Starts checking the RSA Security Token administration site to see the logs on the account.* \"Oh great... They are using the wrong pin.\"\n\n\n$Me: *Unmutes phone.* \"So, from the logs it looks like you have a bad pin. I am going to reset it for you.\"\n\n\n$Me: *Resets PIN and gives user instructions on how to get it setup again.*\n\n\n$User: *Sets up PIN and attempts to login.\" \"It still doesn't work.\"\n$Me: *Checks RSA logs again and sees bad PIN* *Goes through reset process again with the user and instructed them on a PIN to use so I could at least test.*\n\n\n$User: \"It still doesn't work. So are we having fun yet?\"\n$Me: *Accidentally lets out a deep sigh of annoyance* \"Yep, we are having a ton of fun.\"\n\n\n$Me: *Checks RSA logs again, user is now getting an authentication error which is typical of the user not being in the AD group for VPN. Because you know, gotta stop people from working at home.*\n\n\n$Me: \"Have you used the VPN before?\"\n\n\n$User: \"Yeah I use it all the time.\"\n\n\n$Me: \"Okay it looks like you might not be added to the group for VPN users, I am going to send this over to request fulfillment.\"\n\n\n*Closes up chatting with the user with the typical goodbye script.*\nNow, the story continues two days later on Wednesday. $RF messaged me dumbfounded by the issue.\n\n\n$RF: \"So I checked with everyone here and he is in all the groups now, but it still isn't working.\" \n\n\n$Me: \"Um, that's odd because the client is just fine and I have double checked everything he was doing.\"\n\n\n$RF: \"Are you able to take over? I am out of ideas.\"\n\n\n$Me: *Begrudgingly* \"Alright, I will take another look.\"\n\n\n$Me: *After finding out that the user got a new RSA token about a week ago when the problem started happening. I decided to check on the token linked to the user account.*\n\n\n$Me: \"Oh great, someone messed up big time.\" *Staring at the screen blankly as I see the three hours of work put into this ticket so far just get washed away with such a simple fix... I found out that the domain that the key represents it's token code was set for $domain2 when $User was apart of the group for $domain. So I change the domain the token is assigned to and move on to call the user.*\n\n\n$Me: \"Hi $User, its $Me calling from the $C service desk. I had a chance to look at some more information on this and could you try logging in again?\" \n\n\n$User: \"Sure! I can give it a shot.\" *$User seemed much more cheery than the last time I talked with him, I think this was because he figured out finally that it wasn't the server actually being down.*\n\n\n$User: \"Um, it still doesn't work, it says 'Bad PIN.'\"\n\n\n$Me: \"Okay, do you remember your PIN?\" *Remembering Monday with $User.*\n\n\n$User: \"Nope! Are we having fun yet?\" *Well at least he is honest.*\n\n\n$Me: *Disables the PIN for the RSA token and has user attempt to login.*\n\n\n$User: \"IT WORKS!\" *As my eardrum feels as if it ruptures.*\n\n\n$Me: *Bewildered* \"Sounds good, it looks like you are all good to go then.\"\n\n\n$User: \"Thanks so much.\"\n\n\n*Click*\n\n\nJust after the call I start banging my head on my desk because I learned two things. \n\n\n1. Never trust anyone else's work unless you have a meticulously detailed ticket.\n\n\n2. Always assume the user knows absolutely nothing, and work from that point.\n\n\nAfter this, I decide to antagonize $RF politely and start talking in the IM conversation with him again.\n\n\n$Me: \"So, did you check the work done on the user's token when it was swapped?\"\n\n\n$RF: \"Um, no I had set it up and so it should have worked perfectly.\"\n\n\n$Me: \"So you set it up with $domain2 rather than $domain?\"\n\n\n$RF: \"I don't think so? Was that what was wrong???\"\n\n\n$Me: \"Simply put yes, that and the user couldn't figure out how to use a PIN.\"\n\n\n$RF: \"Oh. Well thanks for letting me know what fixed it!\" \n\n\n*Ends conversation.*\n\n\nI went back to my normal duties and about 15 minutes later I got an email from $RF's supervisor exclaiming to my supervisor about how good of a job I have been doing since I have only been here two weeks. I literally slammed my head down on my desk because I was expecting an angry email for using a condescending tone toward $RF. \n\n\nAnyway, I hope you all enjoyed! \n\n\nTLDR:\n\n\nDon't trust anyone's work and always assume people never do their homework with an issue. Lastly, users always take the cake at making you lose faith in humanity. ",

        "text": "*February, 2007*\n\n*Afghanistan*\n\nThe call had come in early, a DART (Downed Aircraft Recovery Team) mission was needed to visit a little FOB (Forward Operating Base) in the back end of nowhere, Afghanistan.  I was happy to volunteer again, but after my [previous trip](https://redd.it/7p79wd) I had actually included cold weather gear in my bag and was prepared for once.  I and another fellow E4, we’ll call him Lucha (short for Luchador…another story will reveal that at a later date…), were told to meet up with  one of our aircrews and be ready to fly shortly.\n\nThe flight was actually the best of my entire time in Afghanistan.  I’d brought my camera this time as well as gloves, so I was able to actually enjoy myself and watch where we were flying and actually get to see some of this country I was in. \n\nThe immediate locale of Kandahar was mostly brown steppe, pocked with impact craters and meagre fields.  As we crossed over mountains, the terrain changed to green sheer hillsides covered in sheep and nomadic herder tent villages.  Crossing more mountains, we were in a grey-brown desert which stretched towards a sudden demarcation of green and city—a river ran through the center of this valley and life had stubbornly clung to the edges of it, similar to the Nile in Egypt.  Up over a mountain again, and this time we were back in desert barrens as far as the eye could see.  The next mountain? Suddenly we were in a lush valley, a river winding through it and short waterfalls seemingly everywhere along its length.  Then it was back over the mountains into a steppe….\n\nThe variations in terrain continued until we entered a somewhat greenish valley in the foothills of the local section of the Himalayas and our UH-60L Blackhawk landed, disgorging us and our toolboxes before a stricken CH-47 Chinook.  As we were taking stock of the scene, we heard in very close proximity the *FWISH FWISH FWISH BAM BAM BAM* of rockets and 30mm cannon firing—we ducked and looked up to see our escort AH-64 Apache strafing something beyond the camp.  One of the Special Forces soldiers stationed at the camp and had met us as we dismounted started laughing.\n\n&gt;**SF** “Oh, don’t worry about that.  There’s a gunnery range on the other side of the hill there.”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Holy hell, they could have warned us!”\n\n&gt;**SF** “Naw, it’s more fun to see you guys jump!”\n\nWe hooked up with the Chinook crew and found out they were getting some oil pressure indication issues from the #2 (right) engine, so after discussing it Lucha and I decided he would go up while they ran the engine and he’d check over the wiring connections for security and the engine for leaks.  We explained our plan to the Flight Engineer and immediately that Sergeant dug his heels in.\n\n&gt;**Flight Enginee*r* “Oh, no, no no.  You can’t go up there with an engine running.  You’re not a trained aircrew, it’s too dangerous.  I’ll have to do it for you.”\n\n&gt;**Lucha**  “…We’re engine mechanics.  We’re considered aircrew too, and we’ve done this on numerous aircraft before.  This isn’t new, and it isn’t even as dangerous as a Blackhawk or Apache.”\n\n&gt;**Flight Engineer** “Nope, you guys wait here on the ground and STAY AWAY.  I’ll do it.”\n\nSo, after flying for a couple hours across Afghanistan to deliver the equivalent of “make sure the cables are tight” Lucha  sat back and watched as the Sergeant fumbled through the simple task of checking cannon plugs on the wiring harnesses on a running engine.  I, being easily distractible, had noticed [something else]( https://i.imgur.com/nRpX6tb.jpg) at a distance.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “What’s with the donkey?”\n\n&gt;**SF** “Oh, you mean Ford Ranger?”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Ford Ranger?”\n\n&gt;**SF** “Yeah, Ford Ranger.  He’s on the property books and everything as a Ford Ranger.  Great for getting around these mountains.”\n\nAnd as if to confirm the Special Forces soldier’s tale, the burro turned, revealing emblazoned on his side in white paint the stenciled words “OEF PROPERTY.”  The special forces guy just grinned as I faceplamed and shook my head.\n\n***\n\nCoincidentally, one of the guys who flew back with us on the Chinook happened to be a police officer from the suburb next to the one in which I grew up and knew my dad.  Also, on that flight Lucha took the only picture I have of myself in Afghanistan.  My wife framed it and put it up among our family photos.  \n\n***\n\n*Enjoy what you've read?  There are [More Tales from Aviation Maintenance](https://redd.it/7i0esb)!  I've also started playing with [Writing Prompts](https://redd.it/8a1fx5) too, just to keep my pen sharp...*\n",
