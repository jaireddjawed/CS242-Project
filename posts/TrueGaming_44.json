In most games this is only ever a problem for the first few hours of gameplay, after that it seems that in most games gold becomes completely irrelevant to the player because you end up with so much.

What would the perfect blend of them be and what can these two philosophies of RPG design learn from each other?

        "text": "To discuss this issue, let's consider a specific case: **Halo 3**, which was exclusive to the Xbox 360. The game had some auto aim (though it was far weaker than Call of Duty's), and it could not be played with a keyboard and mouse. I don't think this next statement is controversial: **FPS players perform better when using KBM, when compared to controllers**. So if the game was available for PC, it would probably not feature auto-aim. Still, players would probably be more proficient at killing opponents because KBM is so vastly superior to controller in this department. But does this mean that the game is **better** on KBM? That's the question.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne of my good friends was involved with the competitive Halo 3 scene and he argues that the game was actually improved by its status as a console exclusive where KBM was not possible. In his opinion, the limitations on the mechanical skill ceiling create an environment where players can't recover from bad decisions through raw mechanical ability. In other words, since it's harder to aim quickly/perfectly with a controller, strategic mistakes are punished more consistently. As a result, the game emphasizes teamwork, decision-making, awareness, and tactics over mechanical ability. This is opposed to other shooters, which he claims emphasize \"aiming quickly\" above all else.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPersonally, I can't wrap my head around this line of reasoning and it seems like a bit of mental gymnastics. Consider the situation where Halo 3 is released on all platforms, instead of just Xbox. Can anyone really imagine that the competitive scene would decry the use of KBM, for the reason that it givesplayers more control? I mean, let's be real here, Halo was limited to Xbox not for some lofty game-design reason, but for financial ones. Microsoft paid Bungie a big chunk of money so that they'd only release it on Xbox. It's also hard to see how giving players more control (and better mechanics) would then limit the importance of teamwork and strategy. Players would be better at hitting their targets, but good teamplay is still necessary to win, because the opponents also have stronger mechanics.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyway, I'm interested in hearing your thoughts.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\njust for fun: would Guitar Hero be better to play on a keyboard? On the Guitar Hero controller, you can only cover 4 of the fret buttons simultaneously; obviously you'd be able to cover 5 keys on a keyboard simultaneously. But would this make the game better?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nedits: formatting",

        "text": "I never really liked card games until I tried a [deck builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck-building_game) which really hooked me. If you don't know what it is, the main idea is that you build a deck during the gameplay from a (often shared) pool of cards that you and your opponent can draw from. This is in contrast to pretty much every currently available online card video game (Hearthstone, Gwent, Faeria, ...) where players build their deck before engaging in gameplay, and only with their own cards that the opponents may not have access to.\n\nDominion, the original deck builder, had various online implementations (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)#Online_play) but they were always poorly done and not distributed on Steam or some other way that gave it any kind of visibility.\n\nSo I'm wondering why such deck builders are not more common. Is it because the genre itself is less popular? Dominion is fairly well ranked on [BoardGameGeek](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion), at 65th position currently, and other deck builders are up there too. So board game players seem to like them a fair bit. Is it not popular just among video game players?\n\nAnother possible reason is profitability. Dominion has a huge number of expansions but is not exactly a collectible card game (CCG). The current card video games are almost all CCGs that rely a lot on microtransactions which are probably harder to incorporate into a deck builder. If a card game developer has a choice between figuring out how to make money out of a deck builder all by himself, or between going the route that is already laid out by all the CCGs, he's more likely to go the CCG route.\n\nAm I missing something else to see the big picture and understand the current card video game market? Do you think that it could be possible to make a successful online deck builder in today's market?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the insightful replies!",

I thought it was super fun, but it did mean you had an instant skip to climbing up a building, I still climbed sometimes just for the fun of it though.\n\nOn the other hand the addition of the wrist bow really did make the game just jokingly easy, I'm very happy it's easy to get sucked into combat in Origins and that combat is hard (still can't beat an elephant, level 38 -_-), it gives off a very MGS5 feeling in my head.\n\nWhat struck you as well done? [Shoddy?](https://gfycat.com/MadShrillFinch) Unity inside out head thread?\n\nA particular character that was well created? Yes, we all know Ezio.\n\nWhile I'm at it, Evie and Jacob Frye are the best video game duo since Donkey Kong and Jr, there I said it. They actually put a lot of thought into their characters and it really shows in a contiguous way that's very rare. Often I'll get into a cutscene in a game and go \"that is not how this guy would have handled this situation\" especially Conor in AC3 (I had no idea if he was supposed to be mad or sad or didn't care or all 3), but I enjoyed a lot more of the writing for Syndicate than I thought I would and the voice actors on the main cast are really top notch.\n\nI think I can honestly say that AC was one of the first series whose story and pretense I actually bought into. With most games I don't really engage with the stories but it really captured me at a time when I needed to learn how to put another layer of self-awareness on the information I was getting and these days with \"Social Media Manager\" being an actual job and widespread accusations of government and foreign meddling in popular opinion on Facebook and other popular sites, all of which completely by chance happen to benefit a bunch of rich bastards in some way, the more strained the relationship becomes between real life factions in real life society all across the world, the more I see a parody of the social commentary the developers were making in AC come to life. Facebook is like the Apple of Eden and most of the world is staring right into it.\n\n[Thoughts?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSVHx23ByhM)",

They say it gives it a fresh feeling. Then there's something like Flashback, which alternates the art style from cutscene to cutscene. \n\nHow do you guys feel about this?

        "text": "I personally loved Gears of War 2's multiplayer. On launch, it may have been the most broken multiplayer game ever released by a popular first-party AAA developer AND publisher. It was so glitchy and messy in general, that after someone made a humorous video documenting all the flaws, Epic games filed a cease and desist order and got the video scrubbed from the internet (temporarily). The game was undeniably super janky and frustrating but after around Title Update 4/5, it became a more consistent experience. I easily preferred it to 3 because the maps were less open, less power weapons, and less \"noob cannons\" like the sawed off or pre-patches retro. \n\nOne of my favorite games is also Deadly Premonition. **I also preferred Call of Duty: Ghosts to every single one that came out after it.** ",

I understand that they need to be there in the water near the shore to prevent ships from coming too close: that way soldiers would be forced to swim for a bit and the Germans could easily shoot them like fish in a barrel. So why did the Germans put these things on the actual beach, knowing that the allies could use it for cover once they reached land? Why didn't they just put them in the water, forcing the allies to swim, then have nothing on the beach so there would be no cover whatsoever and so they could just mow them down with their mounted machine guns like target practice?

        "text": "I love retro games, especially 8-bit and 16-bit games; the pick-up-and-play charm, the lack of obtrusive stories, and the simple pixel art all contribute to experiences that seem to attract both old gaming veterans and new players alike.\n\nAs it turns out, a lot of people love retro games for letting the player into the thick of it without long, pointless-feeling tutorials. Much has been said about how several older games \"teach\" you about the mechanics of the games ([example 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrL3iG_uacw), [example 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpigqfcvlM), [example 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcrdJD8whfE)) without invasive, arbitrary tutorials.\n\nHowever, retro games had something that seems to have all but died out by the 2010s, and that was the instruction manual. These booklets contained fairly detailed texts on how to play the game, what kinds of items to pick up, what kind of enemies you'll encounter, and some more advanced mechanics. Additionally, they also tended to contain character and lore information so that you'll be familiar with the game's world and the people in it beforehand.\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding something about how retro games were designed, but it seems to me that manuals actually *allowed* for these \"subtle tutorials\" in the first place because the text was in a physical place that you could read on your own time. If you wanted a good deal of information before getting into the game, then good! If you just wanted to jump into the deep end with all the surprise it entails, also good! For example, in Mega Man X, nothing in-game tells you how to wall jump, but the [manual](http://www.gamesdatabase.org/Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_SNES//Manual/formated/Mega_Man_X_-_1993_-_Capcom_Co.,_Ltd..pdf) for MMX tells you in no uncertain terms how to do so.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I know the reasons *why* manuals were largely done away with. One, it reduces the carbon footprint because of less paper usage. Two, devs have seemingly lost all faith that anyone reads the freaking manual. Which is sad, because I'm one of the only people I know who actually liked reading manuals.\n\nStill, I can't help but think that the loss of faith in manuals has lead to the much-hated forced tutorials of several modern games. I feel that in-game tutorials could be less invasive to the experience if the manual was treated more as an optional yet accessible part of the experience as opposed to forcing tutorials into it.\n\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong and/or I'm misunderstanding how this all worked; I'm not sure how game design standards worked out back then.",

Also it's easter eggs are the best and creepiest. Here's a video about it but it's not mine https://youtu.be/MTEyYylAEXw they are scary especially the first one. Also it's middle eastern and crusades setting is one of the best settings in the franchise which is rarely explored in gaming\n\nAlso about a month ago I was messing with the game files and extracted the audio files. I found some unused beta creepy music here's a link for it https://youtu.be/416jimHrSCA maybe it's just me but the fact that these tracks are unused and hidden in the game files makes it more creepy\n\nWhat made it special in it's franchise is that it's actually about assassins, there was a real focus on the brotherhood itself, the creed, and everything along with that. It was cold and mysterious, and Al Mualim was a great character. The modern day story with Desmond was similarly dark and built up an incredible premise for future games - I remember being stoked with intrigued by the time this game finished.\n\nI also miss the feeling of preparing myself to the assassination. The information gathering, the time i took studying the place and analysing all info i had. It made all that moment feel important and it made me feel great when my blade finally reached the target's troat. And then the trill of escaping the guards runing through the rooftops and the sound of the bells and the badass music that kicks in while escaping made this one of the best experiences in gaming. That's why I consider it having great atmosphere with it's dark gloomy medieval times\n \nAnd it's music played a great role in it's atmpsphere. It makes it so dark and scary. Here's the full ost of the game https://youtu.be/3pmVWCsa4Vg just click on random tracks from the description if you want to make sure that I am right\n\nThat's why I consider this game to be underrated. I know the gameplay is a bit repetitive but the atmosphere was the best and the graphics was impressive for a 2007 game. sorry for terrible English  ",

Most of them play PUBG and CSGO.\n\nSometimes when we play together (CSGO in this case), I sometimes have off games where I dont do so well and my friends usually attribute it to me playing alot of different games. Which then leads to conversations about \"Man , what I like the most about \"x\" game is that I can just play it forever, and It'll never finish\" or \"How can you call yourself a gamer if you're not loyal to a single game\".",

He mentions that in this game and Planescape: Torment, you play as an ancient being that has been around for millennia and almost every NPC in the game has a story about you. As a result, pretty much every conversation in these games leads to the player trying to find out if the person remembers anything about the main character. What happens is that every conversation feels like a detective game, with you trying to sleuth out the events your past. I found this really interesting because it's a simple trick that allows for the gamification of reading.\n\nI find it interesting how some games can take an approach to a mechanic that's usually boring and make it interesting. For example, Zelda BOTW makes a game out of its climbing by forcing you to keep an eye out for stamina, rain, and resting spots. Compare this to something like Skyrim where the climbing is just sort of \"there\".\n\nWhat do you think? What are your favorite examples of gamification of boring mechanics?\n\n",

Lines like \"take their pride\", \"humiliate your enemy\" are a couple if I remember correctly. But this is actually not the only game that does this, a lot of games have taunts built in to their quick chat system system like the Tribes games and Rock Band 4 for example although the latter only lets you send the premade taunts to your friends. Another example is Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 and the shit talking and bragging the highest scoring players characters do at the end of a multiplayer match. In contrast Halo 5 shows the winning player characters too but they don't say anything, is this an indication of differences in the communities or developers(cause or effect) or is it meaningless?\n\nMy questions to you guys are, do you think this sort of stuff contributes to toxic multiplayer communities even if subtle? Are developers putting this stuff in there because multiplayer is inherently toxic and they think this appeals to players? What are your opinions and thoughts on anything regarding this? You don't have to limit comments to just answers for my questions.",

Its use case would be something like if I had a certain about of gold in Hearthstone for example, and coins in Path of Exile, and platinum in Warframe... I could transfer all of those currencies out of the respective games, convert them into Tap Coin, and then use the resulting total amount of Tap Coin to purchase in-game stuff from another totally different game, or maybe even buy new games from Steam or something.\n\n\nI could definitely see gamers wanting that.

It sounds as though that kind of implementation would prevent them from earning more... or would it? It sounds like the same thing as being able to cash out your in-game currency into dollars and buying other stuff from other games using those dollars.\n\n\nNow, I'm big on cryptocurrency.

        "text": "Alternate title: Why is the Witcher 3 considered deeper than Skyrim? (This post will be comparing the two)\n\nLet me preface this by saying I'm a fan of both, although I prefer the Witcher 3. I also play games for the story and worldbuilding so I don't particularly mind shallow gameplay mechanics. \n\nI often hear Skyrim criticized  as \"wide as a ocean but deep as a puddle\" and even though I am a fan I'm not going to deny this. Especially compared to Oblivion which, even though that wasn't a terribly deep game either, threw more numbers at the player character, (such as attributes). However, I'm not sure why the gaming community doesn't levy this criticism against The Witcher 3 either. I suspect it's because W3 has a much better story, which I would agree with, but that doesn't change the shallow,easy, minute to minute gameplay. I recently did a completionist run on both on the fourth highest difficulty, Death March on Witcher 3, Expert on Skyrim. Let's compare the two.\n\nCombat: Combat in Witcher 3 was really simple, Other than the arrow keys I used like three buttons, click, 'q' and 'spacebar' Those are the three I used because I would use Quen, attack, roll, attack, roll, if I got hit, use Quen, and repeat. During the more difficult fights, I may have used some potions to help out, but I never felt like the game was punishing, even at the beginning, and towards the end I could not tell the difference between the easiest and hardest difficulties. Like seriously mutliple times I checked to make sure I was playing on Death March and hadn't somehow switched over to easy mode. Skyrim on the other hand, while not hard or deep either, was more challenging than Witcher, sometimes this meant more frustrating than fun, but I at least felt challenged at points. TBF I don't like how Skyrim makes stealth archers overpowered, and I don't like how higher difficulties do nothing except increase enemy health and damage, but even on Expert (not even the hardest difficulty) I felt that the game was occasionally a challenge, something I never felt on the Witcher 3. And even though I haven't confirmed this, I'm pretty sure ramping up the difficulty on W3 does nothing except increase enemy health and damage, something I disliked with Skyrim. \n\nMagic. Skyrim flat out has more options when it comes to magic. Witcher 3 has 5 spells exactly, all of which have an equivalent in Skyrim. A defensive spell, a trap spell, jedi mind trick spell, a fire spell, and a force push spell. Skyrim has spells to increase your armor, trap runes, trick enemies into fighting for you, shoot fireballs out of your hands, and fusrodah. But it has stuff the Witcher doesn't, such as conjuring allies to fight for you, healing spells, frost spells, etc. TBF the Witcher 3 does have multiple versions of each spell, something Skyrim doesn't have. But I feel that with Skyrim, even with the number of spells removed from it's predecessors, still has more options, enough so that a pure mage build is viable, which brings me to my next point\n\nCharacter build. The Witcher 3 has three slightly different character build. A 2 handed swordsman, A 2 handed swordsman who knows some magic, and a 2 handed swordsmen who is good at alchemy. You do have some options when it comes to these three different builds, but you are still playing as a rolling 2 handed swordsman. Now Skyrim does have a dominant strategy of stealth archery, but you're not forced into that. Play as a pure mage if you want, play as a sword and board knight. And isn't this what traditional RPGs such as D&amp;D excelled at? You got to fight however you wanted. Skyrim's problem is that you couldn't change the story at all (except for the Imperial/Stormcloak conflict) but in the minute to minute gameplay I felt I had more options in Skyrim. \n\nPerks: Skyrim did have a lot of boring perks. So did W3, but I felt that Skyrim was worse in this regard, so I'll grant W3 this point.\n\nExploration: This is what made me want to write this post. People complained about how the fast travel and compass made Skyrim's exporation shallow, which I would agree with. but at least in Skyrim you had to be close to a cave or fortress or whatever and facing it's general direction for it to show up on your compass. Witcher 3 however, has each point of interest is a question mark on your map. Who in their right mind thought this would be engaging or fun? It simply becomes set waypoint to question mark, go there, kill drowners, repeat. And with Roaches fast speed, I feel like all of Velen and Novigrad can be explored in a few hours. There's no challenge or sense of exploration to... exploration. \n\nAlchemy: Alchemy is extremely simple in Witcher 3. Find a recipe for a bomb or potion or oil (they're all over the place) craft it *once* with ingredients that are also all over the place, then when you run out, rest up a bit and one portion of a common item will replenish all alchemy items. I never once ran out of alcholest This gives no sense to item management it simply becomes \"rest for one hour anywhere when you run out.\" Skyrim is a little more traditional in this sense, with each item making one potion that needs to be remade each time you consume the potion with the same ingredients you made the original potion with. There is also a little bit of trial and error because you don't just find potion recipes all over the world, I mean you do occasionally but these are rarer than the Witcher 3, you have to discover the potion recipes yourself.\n\nStats: people complained about the removal of attributes from Oblivion but Witcher 3 doesn't have attributes or anything similar like SPECIAL from Fallout. It's just health, or vitality, a magic(ka) bar, and stamina/adrenaline-points. You can't level up individual skills like you can in Skyrim. \n\nStory: Witcher 3 blows Skyrim out of the water in this regard. And it's why I think Skyrim has less praise and more criticism given to it. But I wouldn't attribute that to W3 having deeper gameplay, it has a better story, which is different. Which brings me to my original point, what constitutes 'deep?' I mean, I could make a game that could throw as many meaningless statistics at the player as I possibly can and declare I've made the deepest game of all time but somehow I don't think that alone would make a great game. \n\n",

        "text": "Hey, All. I’ve been Working on the concept for a Metroidvania Side Scroller RPG (working title: Project Thorn) and at this time, I have two ideas for how I’d like the gameplay to go based on a companion element to the gameplay. Whichever peaks more intrigue is probably the one I’ll go forward with through the development stage:\n\n1. For a Turn Based Sidescroller RPG, I’m thinking that the game switches to a battle mode whenever the player encounters an enemy and the playable characters and enemies fight based on something called an Initiative System. This would allow playable characters and enemies alike to perform one large attack or several paced-put lighter attacks based on the time when they choose to act according to a meter below the battle screen. (ie Child of Light)\n\n2. For a Real Time Sidescroller RPG, I’m imagining something along the lines of a tTrade System, wherein you fight enemies in real time, but have the ability to swap between the main character and any companions they take in the middle of battle. This way, attack patterns could be adjusted to exploit certain weaknesses or debug specific types of depended that enemies or bosses may have, based on special attributes that companions may possess that are unatinable by the main character. (ie Portrait of Ruin)\n\nI also have a few ideas for how I’d want the companion system to work outside of combat in the game:\n\n1. In terms of the number of companions, I’m thinking of the advice my friend fazermint had given me, and I’ll be working with a roster of about six Companions for base game, but the player can only have up to three companions per playthrough. These companions would either be acquired in the tutorial level, or throughout the early levels of the game. If you thing this is a good number, or if you’d like to see more or fewer, let me know.\n\n2. For each encounter between possible companions throughout the game, the player can choose to save one of two of the characters they encounter, while the other is killed off permanently. Alternatively, the player can choose to ignore both characters if they wish to go through the game solo, and the character that survives the battle becomes a miniboss later in the game.\n\n3. Each companion would possess a special attack that grants access to hidden treasures and save points, along with secret hidden areas in the game (thinking about one area per companion). Thus, it can encourage variation in companions per playthrough to allow for variation in which areas and treasures can be accessed, and which remain hidden.\n\nAny input you guys may have on this would be highly appreciated. This is still an early concept and any input that I could get from you guys on this would be extremely helpful. Thanks ;)",

I started when my parents bought us an NES, played Tecmo Bowl with Dad, Mario with Mom, and watched my brother slog through the first Final Fantasy. I feel like people our age, give or take a few years, are subject to a strange and culturally significant perspective of having witnessed the emergence of video games as an art form from the very beginning. Telling someone who is 18-20 years old that you remember when the SNES first launched is now in many ways similar to someone recalling when they bought their first color tv, or nokia cell phone. In other words, we're old and as far as games are concerned, we've just about seen everything there is to see. Few things surprise us anymore. Not to say that we don't enjoy MGSV, Skyrim, Witcher III, etc., because many of us do (including myself). Nor to make the tired and lonesome argument of \"Games Were Way Better Back In My Day\", what I feel is the ultimate cop-out when failing to garner the same enthusiasm for games as you did when you were a kid, when life in general was infinitely less complicated than it is now. \n\nHow many of us in 90's thought to our kid-selves when playing our favorite games, \"what if you could go anywhere? do anything?\" Games became bigger. Final Fantasy VII was released with 3 separate discs in 1997. Me and my friends were all \"it's so big they had to make 3 separate discs for this shit\", bringing issues of EGM to school to show each other screenshots of fucking final fantasy in 3 dimensions. This is very hard to explain to someone who isn't older but if you were there, you were there, and you know what I'm talking about. Games were undergoing a metamorphosis, from quirky to vast, from niche to mainstream, from telling to showing. The required suspension of disbelief to enjoy and become immersed in a game was lower than it had ever been and continues to decrease, rather exponentially, to this present day. Video games have been become what we dreamed of. Go anywhere, do anything. It seems like around half of all modern games include some variation of this aesthetic. \n\nAt some point, I feel like most of us (from what I've seen on this sub anyway), eventually get bored with a certain game or games, and begin to struggle to find something to play. You may even begin to ask yourself why you even play games anymore, as sometimes, it often feels more like work than relaxation. So we take a break from games for a week or two, get bored or stoned, fire up A Link To The Past or something with an emulator, and have a fucking ball, being reminded why you love to play games, whatever that reason may be. It's not open world, choices rarely have meaningful impact on the story (if there is a story), and doesn't resemble reality in even the slightest sense. And yet, many people our age prefer this linearity, attention to simple yet effective game mechanics, and character. I feel this is almost certainly correlational with the increasing complexity of our personal lives, something that is inevitable with age. \n\nWhen we were kids we dreamed of possibility. Now that we're grown, we yearn for certainty. \n\nWe dreamed of open-worlds, go anywhere, do anything. We have them now. We complain that it usually amounts to a checklist of things to do, people to talk to, places to see. In this way, modern games intrinsically mimic reality. The sad truth is that adulthood itself often devolves into a checklist. Things to do, places to go, chores that have to be done. I spend my whole life keeping track of these things, like we all do, then I come home with a couple hours to kill with Witcher III before I hit the bed, being reminded yet again that there are things to do, places to go, people to talk to, not only in real life but even in my attempted diversion from it through a video game. \n\nPeople that have played games since their near-inception are to due to experience a kind of nihilism, I feel. Our primary interest, as gamers and consumers, was to lower the requirements of suspension of disbelief, to allow maximum freedom and input from the player, to create more realistic environments, and to make us feel that we were actually there. That was our god, our form. We have it now, it has emerged, and yet many of us resent it. It reminds us too much of the nature of our own lives.\n\n**tldr**: When we were kids, we dreamed of what video games would become, wishing for open-world environments, go anywhere, do anything, etc. but as adults we find that newer games remind us too much of real life, creating an existentialist dilemma of sorts.\n",

        "text": "So, I worked on a video for the last four months or so of last year about Final Fantasy XV, intending on releasing it on November 29th to coincide with its first birthday. It was delayed a bit, but that was essentially what I wanted to cover. I essentially review the entirety of the game while covering what has changed over the year.\n\n[Here is the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amzIqLJu6aE)\n\nA couple notes about it (which I mention in the video), I left out the Comrades multiplayer update, as well as December's update. I plan on doing a video for February covering those things as well as anything new that comes over January/February.\n\nThe video covers everything from story to gameplay elements, like combat, sidequests, events, etc.. Now, this video is two hours long, which is an investment of time that I'd understand some people may not want. So, basically what I have to say:\n\n* The story is unfortunately rushed in chunks, so there will be two major events where a lot of things happen, but distanced by chapters of almost nothing. It does, however, contain a lot of really interesting ideas that make the story worth experiencing. That and the updates they made fixed a lot of the parts people were more critical of to be more enjoyable\n\n* The gameplay is similarly disappointing, with the combat being somewhat of a less involved version of Kingdom Hearts. It's filled with really cool ideas but it always seemed like the devs took the easy way out and simplified everything\n\n* The main characters are actually pretty engaging and are part of the reason the story has any areas that are more positive than negative\n\n* Square Enix has improved the game a fair amount in the year of updates, but not completely in the most important ways. Despite that, I'm excited for its future and the future of the series, hoping the FFVII remake is done well\n\nAnyway, for those who want to watch the actual arguments, the video link is there. Let me know what you think about either the video or the game here!",

        "text": "Look, video games coat money, they cost money to make, they cost money to sell, and it costs money to buy.\n \nSo, when I was just out of Highschool, I would get paid about 10$/hr. \n \nSo the average game costs 60$ (new), meaning it took me 6 hours of my life to earn this game (not counting taxes). So in turn the game should entertain me for more than 6 hours. \n \nLast time I checked, I put in 40 days into GTAV online, so that is 960 hours, I did buy 2 copies (one for 360, one for the Xbox one) and I did pay 360$ in Xbox live the 6 years of playing the game (and others) leading to a grand total of 450$ to play GTA V for 6 years. OR 90$ if you don't count internet due to the fact that would have been used in another online related game.\n \nMeaning I spent $.46/hour (to account for xbl) or $.09/hour just on the game by itself. \n \nThis is actually rather cheap, the most expensive part of it all is my xbl. And I never bought any shark cards. And it took me 46 hours to pay for it \n \nLet's compare that to my \"race car\"\n \nI own a 1990 Volkswagen Corrado g60. It costs 3000$ to buy, it then cost me 4000$ to get a new engine (those numbers is everything including transportation and licencing. Insurance costs me about 300$/year\n \nSo 7300$/10 means I need to work 730 hours to pay for the car. Now I don't believe I put in 730 hours in fun in that car.\n \nBut the point I'm trying to make is other hobbies are expensive, gameing is cheap, but how much should the game cost?\n \nGames cost money to make and maintain. They still make updates for GTAV. I definitely got my money's worth, but I feel like I may be spending... Too little. \n \nWhy is this a bad thing? Because this leads to pay to win games, this leads to more dlc, it costs money to make these games.\n \nBut I could also be wrong. Maybe games are far more profitable than before. But games need to make a profit to give us all the fun Stuff that we want out of a AAA game.",

        "text": "I like labeling things. It's almost natural to me. I can't listen a metal band without thinking, \"hum, I would categorize this band as Death Metal or a Death/Doom mix?\" So I have no inherent problem about categorizing games into genres. I do think genres are good generalizations, a helpful way to group similar works. With that being said, I hate \"catch-all\" labels. If completely different works of art are included in the same category, that category is useless. It gives no useful information about its members other than \"it exists and I don't know how to classify it\".\n\nWhich brings me to the action-adventure genre. What, in fact, is an \"action-adventure\"? What differentiates it from other genres? What are its unique characteristics? The more I think about it, it seems \"action-adventure\" is the gaming equivalent of \"other\". If a game doesn't have a well known mechanic (like platforming, pointing and clicking or shooting) or aesthetic themes (like horror), we just stick an \"action-adventure\" label on it and call it a day. I've seen completely different digital experiences like The Legend of Zelda, Assassin's Creed, God of War, Tomb Raider, Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil all classified as the same genre.\n\nIn the case of the latter two, once more games influenced by them appeared, they all got bunched together in new genres — Stealth and Survival Horror, respectively. It's as if action-adventure is a temporary label, used until there are enough games similar enough to group together in a new category.\n\nWhich brings me to two questions I would like to ask you:\n\n**1. Do you think there are more genres that should be separated from the action-adventure label, just as Stealth and Survival Horror did?**\n\nI think it's about time we had a \"zelda-like\", or something like that. Okami, Bastion, Alundra, Darksiders are either classified as action-adventure or action-RPG — which feels wrong to me. I don't know what to call those \"beat the dungeon, upgrade your arsenal, get the macguffins\" games, but the formula has been out there long enough to be considered its own thing.\n\n**2. What to do with the action-adventure genre?**\n\nI have no answer to this, besides trying to come up with more meaningful labels to classify games.\n\nSo, what do you guys think?",

I base this opinion on the people ive talked to about watch dogs. Each time I did id open up notepad and make a note of it, 37/40 people I talked about it with more than 20 of them said they hated the game. All 20 of them also said they did not play the game before. \n2 of them said they felt it was mediocre who did play it.  The rest loved the game. \n\nSo most people I talked to didnt play the game and they hated it lol. \n\nI played through both Watch Dogs 1 and 2 this past week while I had the flu and heres my opinion on the game.\n\nI feel like it was more than alright. Its open world to me was more detailed than any other game ive played, in terms of poly count, textures, everything. I was re texturing some guns in the game and was baffled by how much detail was already there. Pausing the game with cheat engine and then releasing it would make the physics snap back into action revealing all of the npcs having multiple layers of clothing with physics on them. Npcs while not having variety had great detail. \n\nI felt the characters were more interesting than what the game gave off, as if saving for a sequel. For example Raymond Kennedy was easily the best character of the first game to me. But that part of the game was short lived. \n\nI get why people would only focus on the bad things but I didnt see hardly anything praising its attention to detail. Only Ubisoft game Ive felt got the recognition it deserved for attention to detail was Unity, when they took those photographs from the game and stuck them over real life in Paris. \n\n",

If the theatrical release tanks, it will be on Netflix, Hulu or Prime in a few months. If it's a really good film, streaming sites might not offer it free or even for rental for a long, long time.\n\nWith music, it's all cheap/free to stream or hear on the radio but concert prices vary wildly between your favorite band and some random local band.\n\nFor most tangible goods you get what you pay for more often than not. Food, electronics, furniture, clothes, houses, cars, etc.\n\nWith video games you pay $60 for Battlefront, $1.99 for Portal, $10 for Undertale.  Those prices seem completely backwards if you look at from the standpoint of value per dollar.\n\nAm I imagining this disparity between price and experience?
