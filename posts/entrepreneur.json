The last 10 years I've spent operating my own solo engineering services business'. Zero outsourcing - just me in my home office working for clients all around the country that have found me through my website.\n\nIn this post I'm going to show you exactly how to model (yes in a spreadsheet that I will share) **a solo consulting or service business (emphasis on SOLO).** This will be post one of a two post series (I'll follow up on this in a week or two or assuming there's interest).\n\n**Post 1: Developing a Solo Business Model**\n\n**Post 2: Strategic Business Design**\n\nWhat does this mean in context?\n\n*By* ***\"model\"*** *I mean a relating all the variables around time, money, costs, and clients. Literally a spreadsheet where you can change inputs and see how the output changes.*\n\n*By* ***\"strategic business design\"*** *I mean figuring out how to package and position your service offerings in a way that allows you to achieve the model targets.*\n\n# Why Does This Matter?\n\nWhen I started my business, my biggest fear wasn't \"failing\" in the context of having to shut it down and go back and get a real job. My nightmare scenario was trapping myself in a situation where I was working too many hours for too little pay for clients I didn't like. Lifestyle was a huge priority of mine - ending up worse off in that regard than a typical 9-5 wasn't an option for me.\n\nWhat I'm sharing should be a useful baseline for virtually any solo service business where you trade time for money working (from handyman to high end consultant)\n\n# Your Business Model\n\nWe're going to work through four steps to identify and calculate the inputs to our model. Note - this simplified process is meant to be conservative - no consideration for tax treatments and such.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Net Revenue Target**\n2. **Time Targets**\n3. **Fixed Expenses**\n4. **Client Value and Acquisition**\n\nLet's review these one by one.\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jem0UgT.png](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jem0UgT.png)\n\n## 1 - Net Revenue Target based on an equivalent salary\n\nI like to explain this as \u201csalary equivalence\u201d because if you\u2019re working a 9-5, it can be VERY easy to underestimate how much revenue you\u2019re going to need to match that cushy corporate paycheck. Health insurance, self-employment taxes, 401k matches, bonuses, etc.\n\nTreating it as a \u201csalary equivalent\u201d makes it easier to do apples-to-apples comparisons for someone used to a paycheck (which is where I think someone going this route is probably coming from).\n\nHealth insurance costs and self-employment taxes are big hitters. Healthcare can be a  HUGE hitter ($18k for family of 4),  but it's complicated to estimate with [healthcare.gov](https:\/\/healthcare.gov) subsidies and such.\n\n**\\*IMPORTANT\\*** Even if you get healthcare from a spouse - bake it into your model. Why? Well why should your clients get a subsidy from your spouses employer?\n\nNOTE: This is based in the US. Considerations will be different elsewhere so adjust accordingly.\n\n* Start with a Salary target\n* Adjust for health insurance\n* Adjust for FICA \/ self employment taxes\n* Adjust for bonuses or other benefits as appropriate\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/abQpETk.png](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/abQpETk.png)\n\n**BLOCK #1 OUTPUT: Now we have a \"net revenue\" target for our business that we can compare to a typical corporate salary. Net revenue is how much your business has left AFTER business expenses. Ignoring business structure and tax treatments, this is the income that flows down to your personal taxes.**\n\n## 2 - Time Targets\n\nDon\u2019t want to accidentally build a job you hate? **Don\u2019t want to grind 70 hour weeks and make less than your old job?** Then you better model how your time will be spent.\n\n**2.1 Yearly Time Budgets**\n\nDesign your business around a regular work schedule. **If you grind 60 hour weeks it should be by choice because you\u2019re making bank not because you\u2019re desperate to squeak by.**\n\nA person year is 52 x 40 = 2,080 hours\n\nDon\u2019t forget holidays. Don\u2019t forget vacation. Bake those hours into your model. 10 holidays + 4 weeks vacation is 240 hours. That would mean you have 1,840 regular business hours available to hit your baseline objectives.\n\n**2.2 Time Allocation**\n\nKeeping it simple - divide your time up into three buckets\n\n1. *Revenue generating*\n2. *Business development*\n3. *Overhead \/ browsing reddit*\n\n**Revenue Generating Time**\n\nThis is time you spend doing work for clients that they will pay you for. Whether it\u2019s hourly billing, project based, value based or whatever. Think of this as a \u201cbreak even\u201d number of hours for your model. Nothing says you can\u2019t spend more time generating revenue and make more cash, but your baseline model shouldn\u2019t *require* that.\n\n**Business Development Time**\n\nHaving clients requires landing clients. That might be phone consultations, generating proposals, follow ups, etc. This bucket is for the time you spend converting leads into paying clients.\n\n**Overhead Time**\n\nCatch all for everything else. Sending out invoices. Tweaking your advertising. Trying shit. Writing a blog post. Typing up a huge guide and posting it on Reddit. You need a big buffer to deal day-to-day tasks and whatever else comes up. Plus maybe you want some time baked in for other projects (remember 20% time at Google?).\n\nThe default breakdown I have in the spreadsheet is as follows but you do you:\n\n* Revenue Generating: 60%\n* Business Development: 20%\n* Overhead: 20%\n\n**BLOCK #2 OUTPUT: Yearly hourly budget figures for each of our three \"buckets\". We'll use those time allocations to determine our break-even hourly rate and budget time for activities like phone calls and proposal generation.**\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/r4XP2bd.png](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/r4XP2bd.png)\n\n## 3 Fixed Expenses\n\nThis is the easy one. Account for your fixed expenses in your model. These are super low for this type of business when you\u2019re leveraging a home office, home internet, home utilities, etc. ***HOWEVER - you should build these costs into your model as if you had to actually pay for them.***\n\nWhy? Unless your goal is to compete on price (which is dumb - never do that) - then why are you subsidizing your business and letting it permanently couch surf and leech off you and your family? Make it pay rent and utilities. It\u2019s a business not a teenager. And your business model should never be DEPENDENT on working from a home office - meaning it all falls apart if you you had to sublet a small office or rent in a shared workspace.\n\n**BLOCK #3 OUTPUT: Yearly\/monthly budget allocation for fixed expenses to feed into our model.**\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FhGvzmv.png](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FhGvzmv.png)\n\n## 4 - Client Value and Acquisition\n\nThree important variables for your model come from this section.\n\n1. *Client Acquisition Cost*\n2. *Average Client Value*\n3. *Lead-to-Client Conversion Ra*\n\n**4.1 Average Client Value (ACV)**\n\nThis is a simplified model - so we want a single Average Client Value (ACV) that represents the average revenue we expect from a new client over a 12 month period.\n\nGenerally speaking - this is the ONE variable you're really going to experiment with in your model. Think of something like graphic design. Imagine how different the business model is of someone who pumps out logo designs for a few hundred bucks each versus someone doing complete branding packages for higher end clients charging thousands of dollars.\n\nThis is why you want a spreadsheet to plug-and-chug so you can see how different your business looks at different ACV's - then figure out how to package, price, and position your services consistent with the ACV that fits your goals.\n\n**4.2 Client Acquisition Cost (CAC)**\n\nThis is the hardest concept to try and explain in a paragraph.\n\nMarketer types tend to call this CPA (cost per acquisition). I call it something different because I treat it a little differently. I want us to always view CAC as a percentage of our top line revenue. In other words, if you generate $150k - and CAC is 10%, then it costs you $15k to generate that revenue.\n\n**What you\u2019re doing here is baking a marketing\/ad spend budget into your model.** I think 10% is a reasonable target for a solo service business generally, but there can be huge variations here. High-ticket, high margin premium services can afford much higher percentages.\n\n\\*NOTE\\* Successful solo businesses tend to become saturated with recuring work and referrals. This cost can go to zero several years in. Investing in finding \\*high quality\\* clients pays off in multiple ways.\n\n**4.3 Lead-to-client conversion rate**\n\nAt what point is your lead volume too high to support free phone consultations? Or when does a 1 hour consult need to become a 15 minute consult?\n\nYou\u2019re going to dedicate time to all of your qualified leads. Some percentage will become clients, but all will require some of your time. Estimating your close rate helps us understand those time commitments. Remember, it\u2019s not about nailing our model with 100% accuracy today - it\u2019s about understanding the relationships so we can establish realistic targets that meet our objectives.\n\n**BLOCK #4 OUTPUT: Key variables that describe the value and cost associated with our clients. Generally, this is the block you tweak to test different models because your revenue and time commitment goals are probably not going to change.**\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9KYn87o.png](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9KYn87o.png)\n\n## Putting it All Together into a Model\n\nI'm not going to write out equations here (you can interrogate the spreadsheet if you want). There's lots of different ways you can look at this, but my preference is breaking down the outputs across timeframes (weekly and monthly mainly). This starts to give you a clear idea what the business looks like in practice.\n\nRevenue is too noisy to track weekly, but tracking leads weekly can be good (if you go from 10 to 0 you know something is wrong)., So different time frames for different KPI really helps your brain see the big picture of what you're doing.\n\n***Ok so in summary - here\u2019s the inputs we need to in order to build out model:***\n\n1. Net Revenue Target\n2. Time Targets\n   1. Revenue Generating Hours\n   2. Business Development Hours\n   3. Overhead Hours\n3. Fixed Expenses\n4. Client Variables\n   1. Average Client Value\n   2. Client Acquisition Cost (as a percentage of revenue)\n   3. Qualified Lead-to-client conversion rate\n\n**Plugging and Chugging with those inputs we can discover:**\n\n* *Your Top Line Revenue Target*\n* *How many clients you need*\n* *How many qualified leads you need*\n* *How much you\u2019re going to spend to acquire those leads*\n* *How much time you dedicate to each client\/project (consistent with ACV)*\n* *How much time you can dedicate to each lead (consult, proposal, etc)*\n* *What your \u201cbreak even\u201d hourly rate is*\n* *And daily\/weekly\/monthly\/yearly breakdowns of these targets, allowing you to develop KPI to track and monitor your progress.*\n\n[*https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/tH4UQfX.png*](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/tH4UQfX.png)\n\n***Now you can compare and test different approaches and stress test what happens when things don\u2019t break as planned.***\n\nDo you think an $8k ACV with a 25% acquisition cost is your homerun position? Or do you see a clear path to landing $1k clients over and over for a 5% acquisition cost? Simply doing the math on any of these concepts goes a LONG way to understanding them, assessing feasibility, giving your criteria to test, and trading them against each other.\n\nCritically, it will let you DESIGN your service offerings around the ACV that best suits the kind of business you want to build.\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nAll entrepreneurs are risk takers. Good entrepreneurs take calculated risks. Having a well thought out business model (that you clearly understand) does not in any way guarantee success, but it's a step away from just winging it and a step towards that \"calculated risk taker\" category.\n\nSolo service businesses aren't sexy, but they have the best risk\/reward profile of any entrepreneurial venture - particularly when the service is something you already know how to provide. I didn't start my engineering services business because I was desperate to keep doing engineering work - I did it because I had instant credibility on the core thing I was providing so I could focus 100% of my early effort on the \"business\" stuff that I had to learn.\n\n**Direct link to Google Spreadsheet:**\n\n[https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1YTnFBK44yFUR40Od7reSuxbl58ljwdYfSY3Ye4rRM-Q\/edit?usp=sharing](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1YTnFBK44yFUR40Od7reSuxbl58ljwdYfSY3Ye4rRM-Q\/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nFire away with questions!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678718574.0},{"title":"Lifehack books","author":"Dazzling-Map-6065","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11pl7qo\/lifehack_books\/","text":"So I'm reading 'how to win friends and influence people' because someone suggested it on this sub.

I am located in South-Eastern Europe where I can do the same work for much better prices.\n\nThe problem is, I am unsure on how to approach, I know most companies are hesitant to do this because of the endless scams and bad companies that create shitty software full of bugs that in the end will cost more to fix that if it was developer for x3 the price.\n\nI have one idea which might be stupid because it will make me look desparate, but I can offer for example 1 month of free (or almost free) development (of course with some limitations - for example only 1 dedicated developer).

There aren't many reviews online, which is why I'm sharing my experience. I found out about Apex in a Facebook group for salespeople.\n\nHere's what I learned after joining:\n\nThe Apex salesperson really sold me on monthly meetups with Ryan as one of the most compelling benefits and 1 monthly phone call, but I was disappointed to find that Ryan barely showed up or showed up for such a small part at many of the monthly meetups I attended.\n\nWhen I was attending the monthly meetups, I paid $3,500 per month (current members pay more, around $5k-6k) to fly to Dallas and listen to mediocre speakers.\n\nIt was disappointing to me that Ryan missed so many of the monthly meetings, considering the exorbitant amount of money we paid per month and the fact that many of us had to take time off from work and spend money on flights and hotels. Laziness to show up made me feel that they don't appreciate the significant financial and time commitments made by me and the rest of the group for this.\n\nThe monthly meetups:\n\nMonthly \"Fly-in Friday\" meetups were marketed to me as opportunities to hear from A-list celebrities. In reality, mainly the current Apex executive members spoke every month, offering mostly unusable information for my industry. In my experience, 95% of the speakers were less successful than the average member. I always left feeling like why would I want to continue to pay $3,500 a month to hear from people that are averagely successful? \n\nThe speakers that are chosen:\n\nThe fact that I didn't meet any A-list celebrities at the monthly meetups made me feel that the salesperson just used it as a tactic to get me to join. \n\nThe never-ending requests for money after joining:\n\nAfter I joined the endless pitching and requests for money were overwhelming. And in my opinion, the events that offer substance often require members to pay even more money. With an annual fee of $40,000 to $60,000, it's disappointing to learn that additional fees are required for most events with good speakers, like Million Dollar Mastermind. Apex charged much more for Executives members to attend, which felt unfair. It felt like nothing special was done for Executive members. I was told I would get an included Cabo event if I joined as an Apex Executive member, only to discover that it would cost an additional $10,000 to actually attend it. It was a disappointing reality for me and I felt misled.\n\nRyan also frequently asked the group if we wanted to donate to his various projects, including a movie about himself he wanted to make. At one point, it was encouraged for members to send money to a crypto wallet to purchase NFTs as a group but after I sent it I did not get an update on the status of it. Last time I checked, Apex is trying to sell the members a new mastermind on creating masterminds. It\u2019s nonstop. \n\n6. The marketing strategies they teach within Apex \n\nI was told that Apex would teach me cutting-edge techniques to grow my contracting business.\n\nHere\u2019s what I learned instead:\n\nTheir \u201choly-grail\u201d advice for marketing your business, is to 'Build Your Machine'  which is daily Facebook posts. That advice is more relevant for those starting a new business without the funds to advertise.\n\nI was encouraged to pay around $2,000 to join Forbes Councils and was told it was a secret strategy to get publicity. I found out after that it's actually a method that can make you look inexperienced to others in the industry. It also does not help the average member who is a service-based business. How will writing sponsored articles (it\u2019s clearly labeled on the article as paid) going to help me sell more contracting services? Makes no sense.\n\nI was also encouraged to pay someone thousands of dollars in the group to ghostwrite a book so I could become an \u201cAmazon Best Seller,\u201d Once again, how does becoming an \u201cAmazon Best Seller\u201d has anything to do with selling contracting services?\n\nThe strategies I paid thousands to learn at Apex are outdated and sometimes laughable. The marketing tactics are not suitable for most successful and established service-based business owners, as they tend to be outdated and geared toward beginners. \n\nI honestly didn\u2019t learn anything to grow my business besides some feel-good motivational speaker talk. It\u2019s like an MLM convention.\n\n7. Conversations About Former Staff and Students\n\nOne of the most disappointing aspects of Apex is the way you will get spoken about if you leave. This is for members and some employees. If you leave Apex because you feel like it does not provide value can trigger Apex staff. This can create a cult-like toxic environment that's reminiscent of MLM companies. Many people who leave Apex never return because of the way they are made to feel about taking a break from the program. I've personally witnessed the leader of Apex speaking poorly about a former employee whom he once praised from the stage. For example, he fired his CFO a few months back for \"stealing.\" He told this story multiple times, claiming that he caught the employee red-handed. However, the truth was that the leader encourages all of his \"employees\" (most of whom are 1099 independent contractors and not actual employees) to build their own businesses and coach others. When the CFO had someone join his coaching program and stopped paying Apex, the leader accused him of stealing and fired him. This happened while the CFO's wife was fighting cancer and undergoing chemotherapy. If they can treat someone they claimed to love and respect on stage in such a callous way, think how they could behave similarly toward other members he doesn\u2019t care about. \n\n8. Is Upgrading to Apex Executives From Entourage Really Worth It? \n\nWhen it comes to upgrading from Entourage to Executives at Apex, there's not much to gain. In fact, many members in the lower-tiered groups receive more edification and opportunities. The leader seems to offer opportunities to lower-paying members who show worshiping behavior to him like the guy who got on his knees and begged to stay in Apex. If you don't worship Apex and its leaders, you will not get the same opportunities as others.\n\nConclusion: \n\nIn conclusion, I  regret joining Apex. It was a waste of time and money.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678660355.0},{"title":"What skill to learn to make money","author":"Goku560","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11pu18n\/what_skill_to_learn_to_make_money\/","text":"Hi all,\n\nI lurk on this sub Reddit and every time there is a post where the op says I have money what should I do most common answer is learn a sellable skill.\n\nMy question is other then coding, marketing, sales, video editing and Graphic design.

Depending on which chip you use during a battle, it would trigger different things: for example, if you used the \"HP 10\" chip, you would gain 10 HP for that turn, very similar to the Mega Man PET toy. You can also level them up by training them and breeding them, which would unlock different characteristics so that every 'pet' would be unique both looks and stats wise (similar to Pok\u00e9mon\/Chao Garden from Sonic Adventure 2) and then you can battle with friends! \n\nThere's a lot more details I have written down and even more that are still up in the air, but I wanted to ask if this even sounds interesting to others, or just to me?\n\nThank you for your time!","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678686129.0},{"title":"Anybody here affected by the Silicon Valley bank collapse and want to share?","author":"MoreLynx6389","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11ow0c5\/anybody_here_affected_by_the_silicon_valley_bank\/","text":"I know this came abruptly and is very sad \ud83d\ude1e curious who here was affected and if they would like to share.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678570963.0},{"title":"What are some creative ways of advertising an Airbnb outside of Airbnb?","author":"rakibnaz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11q0vsk\/what_are_some_creative_ways_of_advertising_an\/","text":"TLDR: what are some creative ways of advertising your Airbnb thats 1.5 hours away from Charlotte, to folks in Charlotte?\n\nI have a gorgeous 3100 sq ft 4 Br 3 Ba mountain cabin Airbnb with gorgeous views.

You feel stress or tension. Focus on this feeling. It helps to lower your shoulders and breathe into it. Take the time to just sit down and figure out which emotion this is \n\n2. Now that you\u2019ve identified it, let yourself sink into the feeling. Welcome that feeling like you would a guest into your house and truly get to know it. \n\nLearn what these emotions feel like. Become familiar with them. The more you let yourself feel the emotion the faster it will pass and you can move on \n\nRumi wrote \u201cpain is where the light enters you\u201d this is true in my experience. There\u2019s only so much pain there and underneath it is love, not bullshit Hollywood love, but something far more profound. \n\n3. Repeat the pattern again. Next time you feel stressed take note of it and sit with it when you have time \n\nHERES A QUICK LIST OF EMOTIONS\n\nyou know what anger feels like so let\u2019s focus on some emotions that you might now be familiar with. All these emotions carry so much weight to them. The weight makes life so heavy, you want to shed the weight and then you have more energy \n\nGuilt (feels like duty, obligation, \u201cI should\u2019s\u201d blame and accepting blame, defensiveness and accusations\n\nShame (embarrassment, humility, unworthiness, self hatred, self sacrifice, living for others, what will others think of me?)\n\nGrief (heavy heavy emotion, sadness, weakness, excessive need to be strong and just get by, \u201clife\u2019s so hard\u201d mentality \n\nFear (scarcity esp. around money, not having enough, \u201cI\u2019m not safe\u201d freezing up)\n\nYou\u2019re gonna say \u201caren\u2019t their good emotions\u201d \n\nThis is where we stray from the path\n\nAll emotions are distortions. By simply having emotional blockages we\u2019you\u2019re giving up so much of your energy\n\nPicture this, your boss tells you manager to pay you $1,000 and the manager pays you $100. Because you didn\u2019t know what was available you thank the manager so much for his generous contribution. Emotions are the same. \n\nWe believe that feelings of duty or anger can give us that energy but they actually take it and regulate it and give a fraction back to us. If you knew what was available you wouldn\u2019t settle for a moment. That energy is rightfully yours you just have to figure out how to access it. \n\nFollow this emotional release framework and you\u2019ll free up SO MUCH of your energy, you\u2019ll drastically expand your comfort zone, you\u2019ll clear up your cognition and be able to think so much clearer now that the latent fight or flight response is gone \n\nI truly hope this helps you as much as it\u2019s helped me.

Let me explain .\n\nThe most expensive part regardless of marketing and development is Processing Time. Let's have a look at Image AI Tools. I omit marketing cost (it depends on the product), development cost and maintenance is constant  in SAAS\n\nFor example on a monthly basis I need to do:\n\n* once logo generation\n* few times to remove background on the photo\n* sometimes to create memes \n* sometimes to combine the results together\n* generate artificial models or items again few times per month\n* e.t.c.\n\nThe main problem is that everyone wants to charge me monthly regardless of usage of resources I consume. Fair or Unfair is it?  I have no idea. \n\nProbably I am not the target audience. My main point is that to perform common, sometimes even boring operations few times per month, you have to pay more than 300+,  use a lot of tools and still polish the final result.

Framing Effect on Pricing \n\nIt is meant to change how consumers see pricing of a product. \n\n**What most people think it is:** Showing a price in a format that makes people think it is relevantly cheap. For Example, $30 for Netflix, No it is only $1 per day! \n\n**What goes into Framing To make people buy:** \n\nConsumers take account of these factors to make the end decisions: \n\n* Actual Price \n* Perceived Quality \n* Perceived Sacrifice \n* Perceived Value \n* Willingness to Buy \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t just say $1-3 per day just to fool people into buying. They still won\u2019t buy, big brands calculate all these factors to come up with a framed pricing that makes people. \n\n**My Advice:** Study how Dollar Tree prices every product by framing perceived value & pricing in their stores. \n\n#2. Labour Illusion doesn\u2019t work for everyone \n\nThis cognitive bias talks about how people care more if they see the work behind it. \n\nWell explain why then Apple charges 5x for a new Mac and when you try to exchange it after 1 day of buying it, they lower the pricing by 3-4 times the original price. \n\nDid the work behind MAC decrease in value within 24 hours? There are millions of examples showing that companies putting the least input are charging more than SMBs putting more and more work. \n\nPeople care about end product quality & things that matter to them. \n\nLabour illusion is tied with storytelling, if you want to show the work behind your business. You need to understand what to show & what to not. Again it is another cognitive bias that doesn\u2019t lead to billions! \n\nIt helps in community building the most. \n\n#3. Goal Gradient Effect works in two ways \n\nThis effect makes people more eager to contribute towards a goal by incentivising their progress & presence of other people taking action. \n\nTo explain a study done by Elsevier proves that consumers were more likely to contribute to donations when told how far the organisation was to reaching a goal. \n\nThe set of consumers who were not informed about progress donated less than set of consumers informed about the progress. \n\nAnother similar report showed a set of Consumers that how many people have contributed to goal of helping X individual reach 32 candy sales. And this effect of showing the presence of other people joining made people contribute too. \n\nIn real-time, Using this bias, Harry\u2019s (shaving Company) crafted a great referral campaign showing how far were people from winning a new shaving kit. This campaign resulted in upto 100k new email sign ups. \n\nThe other bias about presence of other people, You can visit Ahrefs landing page where they show how many people signed up last week for their platform. And that gives website visitors to join and test the platform like others. \n\n#4. Humour Effect Exists but Impact is hard to measure \n\nThere are likely reports from platforms likr Discord, Hubspot suggesting that Humour can increase how consumers perceive your brand but buying decisions are still hard to change. \n\nFirst various research papers show Humour at its best can influence small buying decisions like buying of ballpoint pens. \n\nBut humour advertising & Meme marketing helps brands to turn the consumer behaviour around as perceived humour by consumer will make the most impact & how often the Consumer notices the brand connected with Humour Ads. \n\nOverall this bias affects consumers but in long term if you do other things right too. \n\nAnother bias that can\u2019t make billions for you! \n\n#5. Underdog Effect- An Effect that requires way more time \n\nThis bias explains that people tend to support underdogs and brands that are underdogs in a market full of unicorns. \n\nConsumers also feel more passionate about the brand that is underrated. \n\nHow can we use this bias in reality? Well you can\u2019t because first you need to be generate brand awareness as a new business to be considered as an underdog. \n\nAfter that the feelings about your brand are developed after purchasing the product. \n\nMeaning this is another bias that won\u2019t make you millions, unless you are really good but don\u2019t have the marketing budget. \n\n#6. Nostalgia Effect \n\nI don\u2019t even need to explain this bias because the brands that are already established probably made billions from bringing back the nostalgia design like Coca Cola. \n\nFor SMBs & Startups, You can only create posts about Y2K or old trends to be relatable and that\u2019s part of your social media strategy not buyer psychology. \n\nChances of making billions ~ 0 \n\n#7. IKEA Effect \n\nThis is the only bias, I genuine agree with. This bias states people tend to love or value things more that they had part in or if they put their own work into completion. \n\nThere are many studies to prove this bias but the real time examples are Dads & Legos. \n\nI haven\u2019t met a single person that throughs legos after creating. And I have never seen a dad sad after putting together something that he bought from home depot or IKEA. \n\nThis bias connects with human nature, but it\u2019s very limited to usage. As you need to find the hidden element of your business that makes people feel connected. \n\nThere are few businesses where people don\u2019t wanna get involved like lawn mowing. \n\nThis can make billions but hard to use! \n\n#8. F**k Decoy Effect \n\nAt this point, we have been told that it works so many times. Even 90% of the consumers know that there is a decoy in this offer. \n\nWhich brings us to that may be it\u2019s time to not use the third option as decoy & replace it with more valuable plan. \n\n#9. Believe Me Bias is the most powerful \n\nFirst I wanna say, You don\u2019t need psychology to be good at business marketing. These biases & psychology threads are known to go viral & I find 100 of these every month being recreated on Tiktok, Twitter, IG & reddit. \n\nIt\u2019s a piece of content idea that brings engagement & traffic. Nothing more than that! \n\nYour industry changes every week. Marketing also changes every week & these biases won\u2019t help you. \n\nFirst, You need to understand the consumer (not consumers) only one or at the most two personas to do better marketing. \n\nSecond, You need to do better at content, and it can be in any form. A review on yelp is also a piece of content that helps your business. Just make sure you are listening to your audience & creating content that matters \n\nThird, You need to track how marketing is changing. There are on average 20+ new updates, 10 new tools, 50+ Valuable reports launched every week. \n\n**To stay on track with marketing updates & news, I recommend readers [this newsletter](https:\/\/jaskaransaini.com\/thesocialjuice\/) with no BS, only information about trends & new changes.**\n\n*That\u2019s all I have to say! I hope this post helped you to understand marketing better. I know this post won\u2019t get 1.8k upvotes like that one. But still I hope this was valuable!*","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678519998.0},{"title":"Working Out of Storage Units?!","author":"JoeMothCatcher56","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11otxf2\/working_out_of_storage_units\/","text":"There is an increasing number of social media videos showing new entrepreneurs working out of storage units. - Packing orders, taking product photos, etc. \n\nSince storage units are much cheaper than leased warehouse space, I see the appeal.\n\nLegality?

Obviously I still have a lot to learn but I feel that I\u2019m at a point that I could add value to other companies besides my employer.\n\nThe concept behind the business idea that I\u2019m trying to develop already exists, they\u2019re called IoT integrators, essentially they find small industrial operations (such as factories or mining operations) that don\u2019t have a predictive analytics (for preventive maintenance and failure prevention) and install the require hardware and software to make it possible.\n\nI have a lot of familiarity with certain types of equipment such as gearboxes or generators and l know the constantly fail in different ways that can be predicted and prevented.\n\nThe challenge that I face is that I don\u2019t even know where I would begin to make this happen, where I live there are plenty of factories and similar potential clients, but I don\u2019t know if I have the experience, capital or tram to do a full solution yet (hardware, software, alarm solution, cloud solution, etc.)\n\nI\u2019m planning to begin to call some of these locations to find out how they\u2019re failing equipment, and maybe that way I\u2019ll begin to build some insight and additional knowledge of what a good product would look like.\n\nAlso I was thinking of looking for a mentor or trying to recruit a couple of people who\u2019s be interested in building something like this with me.\n\nAny insight or feedback will be greatly appreciated, I\u2019m willing and eager to work hard to make this happen, I just need a little nudge to know where to start.\n\nThanks in advance!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678555741.0},{"title":"Advice to business idea","author":"Scr3w_You","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11ohp5e\/advice_to_business_idea\/","text":"Hi guys, I'm a German programmer and webdev and I'm thinking about creating an online place for startups, small and medium sized companies to promote themselves and their products.

The journey is bound to be fraught with challenges, setbacks and failures. If your \u201cwhy\u201d isn\u2019t rock solid now, when the going gets tough, you\u2019ll begin wondering why you are doing any of this in the first place. Don\u2019t just dive in because it seems easy \u2013 get clear on your why first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **Know what your pricing needs to be to make a sustainable profit**\n\nSure, you might be able to borrow your uncle's box truck and convince your buddies to help you with a move or two in exchange for a case of beer but that only works for so long. Eventually, you\u2019ll need to rent or purchase equipment, hire employees, pay insurance, service debt, etc. Just because you c*an* start super cheap and \u201cbuild the airplane on the way down\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you should. Give yourself the best chance of success by doing detailed market research. Some things you should know before beginning:\n\n* How much investment will you need to begin?\n* What\u2019s the going rate for labor in your city?\n* How much are competitors charging?\n* What are all the expenses you will incur running your business?\n* How much will you have to charge to make a profit?\n* Is there demand for your service at that price point?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Niche down and know the pain points of your target audience**\n\nThere is nothing more important in business than knowing your customers - and failing to do this is a mistake I see businesses big and small make all the time. It can be tempting to make assumptions about your customers because of the false consensus effect: A cognitive bias where we believe that others must think, feel, and judge the world in the same way we do.\n\nI started my company, Oncue, after spending hours interviewing multiple moving company owners - my potential customers. During one interview an owner\u2019s phone rang. Exasperated by the amount of calls he was bombarded with he handed me his phone saying,\n\n*\u201cHere, you take this one.\u201d*\n\nThere it was! My target audience didn\u2019t have the time or energy to manage their calls or to document and manage their leads \u2013 so I created a company to help them do that.\n\nI would encourage you to do the same. Find out from people who need to move what their stressors are and how other offerings aren\u2019t meeting their needs. Are Millennials in your area worried about moving with young children? Are older folks who are downsizing overwhelmed with all the clutter they have to sort through? Are renters worried about losing their damage deposit if they don\u2019t patch up holes and leave the place in perfect condition for the next tenants? Are people immigrating to your city for work worried about a language barrier?\n\nKnowing your potential customers needs, beyond just that they need to move, will help you niche down your offering and provide the best quality service \u2013 all while out maneuvering your competition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. **Know your competitors**\n\nSpeaking of competition \u2013 you need to know what you are up against. Keep in mind that in a service industry with low barriers to entry, like moving, competition is going to be a threat to your success. In order to succeed, you need to be able to provide significant value through a combination of high quality service and competitive pricing. So do your research and know what it will take to stand out in your local market.\n\nAdditionally, know who your indirect competitors are. Potential customers choosing to rent a truck and invite their friends to help is a version of indirect competition. People choosing to sell all their furniture and buying new items in their next location would be another form of indirect competition. Being aware of all the possible solutions your potential customers may turn to will help you determine if, and how, you should fight for their business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. **Know what your plan \u2013 and your backup plan \u2013 are**\n\nOne thing in business you can bet on is that things won\u2019t go the way you expect. In the early days of starting Oncue, one of our customer\u2019s clients called (as we were managing their calls and leads) and was furious. She told us that her clothes had been soiled during the move. Not wanting to sour the relationship, I offered to pay for her dry cleaning bill directly. What I didn\u2019t know was that she was referring to all of the clothing that she had ever owned\u2026 We had to eat a massive dry cleaning bill! This was during our startup days and this unexpected expense was significant.\n\nWhile you can\u2019t know the future, you can do your best to mitigate risks. Think through how things can go wrong. What if an employee gets sick last minute? What if a truck crashes? What if a home is damaged during a move? What if a competitor lowers their price and targets your customers? Considering how things can go wrong, and making preparations, will help you avoid failure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 5 Things successful movers have in common:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **They know their lead sources (and how to maximize them)**\n\nWhile organic leads - people who find you via research and word of mouth - convert at the highest rate, no moving business can survive on them alone. To grow, movers must pay for leads, be it through advertising (like Google or Facebook ads) or through lead sources (like Angie\u2019s List or Thumbtack). Successful movers understand which channels yield the best results, and know how to market successfully into each. Each market is different, however, so there is no one-sized-fits-all marketing solution for moving companies. The best way to learn this skill is to experiment on these different platforms, keep close tabs on which channels your leads (and closed deals) are attributed to, and then by modifying your spend to maximize your budget.\n\nFor more on how to find leads for your moving business, check out our free (no email required!) ebook [Top 7 Lead Generation Tips For Your Moving Company](https:\/\/bookmorejobs.oncue.co\/top-7-lead-generation-tips-for-your-moving-company).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **They have a robust follow up process for leads**\n\nMastering paid lead channels is only half of the battle \u2013 if those leads aren\u2019t converting to won-jobs they aren\u2019t worth anything. The best moving companies understand the importance of capitalizing on their inbound leads and have systems in place to do so. The result is that they are quickly returning calls, giving accurate and competitive quotes, and following up on quotes to win more deals. For smaller moving companies, this responsibility often falls on the owner\/ operator. Larger movers may choose to hire someone to manage these calls, or outsource them to someone like us to help manage them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. **They communicate clearly with the client**\n\nMoving is a stressful life event and, while it might be another day at the \u201coffice\u201d for you and your crew, for your customer this is a massive and exhausting undertaking. The best moving companies recognize this, and do everything they can to reduce stress for their customers. They communicate critical information, like:\n\n* How to prepare for the move and additional services they offer to make the process smoother\n* When they are on their way and their ETA\n* How things are progressing, particularly if the client isn\u2019t onsite\n\nThe best movers communicate early and often, helping answer questions, mitigate confusion, and reduce anxiety for their customers - increasing customer satisfaction (and positive reviews).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. **They follow up with clients**\n\nWhen running a business, it can be easy to get swept up in the chaos, constantly moving (ba-dum-tiss) onto the next thing. However, the best moving companies don\u2019t just finish the job, collect payment, and leave \u2013 they have processes established that maintain contact with past clients. These follow ups - usually in the form of emails -  increase positive reviews and help win repeat business. Post move email campaigns might ask for a review two weeks after a move, ask for a referral a month after, and then 10 months later (when a year long lease is expiring) they follow up to see if their services are needed again. By providing timely and valuable emails, movers can stay top of mind, increasing repeat business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. **They differentiate from their competitors**\n\nIn the highly competitive world of moving, it\u2019s important to find out what makes your business stand out. Successful moving companies know their niche and lean into that specialization. We have seen movers differentiate in many different ways: Some hire a certain group of people (like[ firefighters](https:\/\/firstduemovers.com\/),[ military veterans](https:\/\/veteransmovingservice.com\/),[ ex-convicts](https:\/\/slc.theothersidemovers.com\/), etc.) while others focus on what type of things they move (such as[ piano movers](https:\/\/walterpianotransport.com\/),[ heavy items](https:\/\/www.prestigemoversca.com\/large-heavy-items), and[ antiques & collectables](https:\/\/www.paulasmovers.com\/services\/antiques-artwork\/)). Some brands differentiate by making their operation seem small and down-to-earth with names like[ Two Men and a Truck](https:\/\/twomenandatruck.com\/), while other brands stand out with funny names like[ GTFO Movers (Get That Furniture Out!](https:\/\/gtfomovingco.com\/)) However you choose to do it, find a way to distinguish yourself from the competition in your local region. Remember, everytime a potential customer calls asking for a quote, the real question going through their mind is \u201cWhy should I trust you?\u201d Help make the decision easy for them.\n\nI hope you find this helpful.

While I know many people will argue that I\u2019m still young. It\u2019s hard to see it that way. Especially now a days with social media when I see 15 year old millionaires. Who are making more money in a day than I make in a year. While I understand that not everything you see in social media is true there is still some who truly aren\u2019t lying. And I can\u2019t help, but compare myself to them and feel like a failure. Ever since I was a little kid I knew what I wanted in life was to be rich. When teachers would ask what you wanted to be when you grew up and everyone gave stereotypical answers like doctor, architect, teacher etc. My answer was always \u201cMillionaire\u201d. Didn\u2019t matter whether I was in 3rd grade or a senior about to graduate. Now fast forward to the day I graduated high school. I went part time to college just to appease my parents. I dropped out within the first semester. However, I was still obsessed in wanting to make it to the top one percent. I\u2019ve focused the last 4 years to try and make it. I\u2019ve tried many different ways to create a business and make money. I\u2019ve read more financial, self improvement, and psychology books than I can count.

It was known for its delicious eggs, cheap whiskey, and the lively conversations that took place between the patrons. On this particular day, a Native American from the Wild West, a Space Marine from Warhammer 40K, and Odin himself found themselves at the same table, engaged in a heated debate on the merits of hiring from within.\n\nThe Native American, whose name was Grey Wolf, was a seasoned hunter and tracker. He had lived off the land all his life and had a deep respect for nature. \"I believe in hiring from within,\" he said. \"I have seen the wisdom of our elders, who pass on their knowledge to the younger generation. It ensures that our traditions and skills are preserved.\"\n\nThe Space Marine, who went by the name of Captain Grim, was a towering figure with bulging muscles and glowing eyes. He was clad in power armor, and his weapons were never far from his reach. \"I disagree,\" he said, his voice deep and authoritative. \"In the Imperium, we must always seek out the best and brightest, no matter where they come from. We cannot afford to be sentimental when the fate of the galaxy is at stake.\"\n\nOdin, the All-Father of Norse mythology, looked on with interest. He was a wise old god who had seen many battles in his time. \"I have seen the value of both approaches,\" he said. \"There are times when loyalty and tradition are more important than raw talent. And there are times when you must cast your net far and wide to find the right person for the job.\"\n\nThe conversation continued for hours, with each of them presenting their arguments and counterarguments. Grey Wolf spoke of the importance of community and the bonds that are forged through shared experiences. Captain Grim spoke of the need for discipline and the importance of meritocracy. And Odin spoke of the ever-shifting tides of fate and the need to be adaptable to changing circumstances.\n\nAs the night wore on, they all began to see each other's point of view. They realized that there was no one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of hiring. It depended on the situation, the people involved, and the goals they were trying to achieve.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses in a toast to the power of debate and the wisdom of learning from different perspectives. They had come to the Eggbar as strangers, but they left as friends, united by a shared respect for the power of words.\n\nThe Eggbar Debates may have been just another conversation in a long line of debates, but it was one that would be remembered for years to come.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678471756.0},{"title":"Money transfer from overseas (Morocco) to USA.","author":"mouhsinetravel","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11nw2w4\/money_transfer_from_overseas_morocco_to_usa\/","text":"Hi everyone,\n\nMorocco has very strict laws on how you can transfer your money legally as a normal citizen.\n\nIs there a way to transfer money overseas by creating LLCs or something like that.

I have a degree in business & finance and a passion for food so I will do whatever to be successful, strictly looking for opinions and thoughts on the concept\/idea so here it goes:\n\nA restaurant with the korean bbq setup except its all latino foods. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about how those restaurants easily up-charge you just on the fact that its \u2018all you can eat\u2019 but in reality their margins are still decent with cheap meat in bulk, hardly any need for any type of gourmet chefs since its just waiters taking meat from the fridge to the table, good experience for drinking, etc. \nAnd think about it, with most places charging 35$ a head, thats a hell of a dish to sell at any other decent restaurant. \nBut what really had me thinking is why do we associate korean bbq with the whole self cooking meats restaurant experience?  Who said only korean bbq is like that and who said that is even korean bbq?  90% of the meats at those places do not come marinated making them basically just a neutral cut of meat. Yes the sides are definitely korean but other than that, doesn\u2019t every culture grill their meats socially?\n\nSo thats why I think a latino version would be a hit. \n\nYou could offer a wide range of beef for carne asada styles, chicken, pork such as carnitas, etc all either marinated or not (up price for marinated of course). And sides could include corn, different styles of beans and rice, salsas, chips, quesos, tortillas, etc\n\nWith an emphasis on selling alcohol drinks as well of course, I dont see why it would be hard to keep a good margin especially since latin food can be very cheap to produce. \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts or any reason you think this would not work.

Just expressing myself coz I feel a bit lonely.\n\nNote: I'm appointed to run the company, I don't own it. There are other managers who own stakes and I can't just fire them. All of this is not much relevant since the post is about my emotions but just setting up the context. \n\n_____________________\n\nI got friendly feedback from one of the managers today that irked me too much. The feedback goes as follows:\n\n\u2022 \"You know what, the people who get big are the ones who aren't ready and aren't even deserving but shoot their shots when opportunity arises\" (gave an example of someone from her college)\n\n\u2022 \"I have friends who were very intelligent in college and can code very well but they are working at minimal salaries and are stuck in their positions because they can't communicate or they feel they are not ready\" \n\nThe context behind these statements is me taking too much time to set things right on the website. \n_______________________\n\nI lead the team and my style of management is a disastrous combination of perfectionism, micromanagement, and on top of that, my Lazyness. This doesn't make a good leader. \n\nI fully accept my imperfections. \n\nBut even with my imperfections factored in, I'm literally the only one in company who can set the direction we should go. I'm the only one that can think strategically about product, marketing, operations, design etc and putting it all together.\n\nThis is not too much work to show on paper, I know. But they are of extremely high significance. This is one such thing that makes everything else easy - including the work of the managers. \n\nBut they don't even have the intellect to understand I made it easy for them. Marketing became easy coz the product is designed to be fckin marketable. Getting partnerships is easy because the propositions are fckin lucrative. But yet they don't do a good job at it.\n\nAll of this is high level sh*t. It takes time to get it right.\n\nI can't give this to managers because I did it previously and was surprisingly disappointed ! THEY DON'T. THEY CAN'T. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY CANT. \n\nThis is too much burden and consumes too much time too. I don't have the bandwidth to take up my personal projects that can bring in 100x more than what I'm paid here. \n\n____________________\n\nBasically, the managers and their ignorant incompetence is what's holding me back and I get to hear lectures today \ud83d\ude2d\n\nShe has absolutely no clue how I'll demolish the \"opportunity siezers\" that she was quoting me. I felt insulted while hearing because one - she doesn't think I'm a killer, and two - I already am in a better position the person she was quoting as example. When I tried to get to the bottom of it, asking why she's telling me all this and how those others are better than me, she cut off the conversation telling me I'm blowing it out of proportion. \n\nIt's not just her. \n\nThere's another friend of mine who was praising the potential of a guy he met recently. He introduced me to him. I was not as impressed with that guy. \n\nIn a later conversation, this friend of mine started giving scenarios about how that guy, his charm, his communication, etc will end up getting him funded by some VCs and kept insisting on it. I told him I don't think so. I also added that by the time he gets funded once, I'll get funded 10 times over - for which his response was that I have my own ways of getting things done. \n\n_______________________\n\nSo, what makes me so unlikeble?  \n\nWhy did she even tell me about that opportunity siezer when she knows my growth was even better? (I'm her CEO ffs) \nWhy was this other guy being praised infront of me when I already did what he wants to and do it 10 times over before he gets funded even once. \n\nAnd finally, why do I never hear praises about me? Nobody from my college, friends circle, and even workplace is doing as good as I am. Hell ! I got friends who went to the US for higher studies and came back with a borrowed personality and ego.

It forms the first impression of your company and provides all crucial information and links in a concise form.\n\nThis is a make-or-break stage as the customer may leave the site instantly if unimpressed or may proceed to make the purchase. Either way, it takes just one click!\n\nHence, it is crucial that your landing page is built in an attractive and compelling manner that convinces your customers to go ahead and buy your product or service.\n\nNow, there are 5 key pillars on which your landing page is built and if all 5 are strong, your landing page will generate large sales and revenue for you. Let\u2019s discuss them one by one-\n\n**The offer**\n\nThe landing page must provide key details about your offering and convince the visitors to go ahead and buy it. You must make a brief yet impactful offer along with clear call-to-action links to direct the customers toward making the purchase.\n\n**The visuals**\n\nA picture not only says a thousand words, it also attracts attention! Hence, visually appealing and informative images can make your landing page engrossing and easy to understand. Naturally, this will impress your visitors and lead to higher conversion rates.\n\n**The text**\n\nText that is written lucidly and thoughtfully will certainly have a favorable impact on the visitors to your landing page. The text must introduce the offering to the reader and explain how it will benefit them in a concise yet compelling manner.\n\n**The focus**\n\nYou may be tempted to add as much promotional material on the landing page as possible, but this could be disastrous! The focus should always be on the course of action that the visitor must take. Hence, explanations should be to-the-point and call-to-action buttons must be highlighted. Excessive text, media, or popups should be avoided as they may result in distraction.\n\n**The performance**\n\nThe overall experience of your visitor should be interesting and comfortable to ensure that he or she acts favorably. Hence, you must make sure that the page works quickly and smoothly across all device platforms. Also, it must be free of glitches, hanging, or delayed responses.\n\nSo, you must make sure that your landing page is unbeatable on these 5 criteria; and you\u2019ll find high conversions and sales from your landing page in no time!\n\nAll the best!","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678368533.0},{"title":"Which of these media houses would you pay to get yourself featured?","author":"onlinegrowthguy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11nqhb7\/which_of_these_media_houses_would_you_pay_to_get\/","text":"\n\n[View Poll](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/poll\/11nqhb7)","upvote_ratio":0.21,"created_utc":1678458017.0},{"title":"looking for Beta testers to try our product, are you creating on TikTok?

That's how it was for me when I got hit by a car and ended up in a coma. I felt lost and helpless, not knowing what my future would hold.\n\nBut then something strange happened. In my coma, I found myself in a place where I met Didi Kong, Jair Bolsanaro, and Atilla the Hun. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, but they told me that they were there to help me. They said that they had come together to give me a message, a revelation that would change my life.\n\nAnd that message was about egg bars. They told me that egg bars were the change I needed in my life. At first, I didn't understand what they meant, but as they explained it to me, everything started to make sense.\n\nEgg bars are not just a food item, they are a symbol of change. They represent the idea that you can take something ordinary and turn it into something extraordinary. You can transform your life in the same way that a simple egg can be transformed into a delicious and nutritious meal.\n\nThe message that Didi Kong, Jair Bolsanaro, and Atilla the Hun gave me was clear - egg bars could be the change I needed. And I took that message to heart.\n\nWhen I woke up from my coma, I knew what I had to do. I went out and found an egg bar, and it was the best decision I ever made. Not only did it nourish my body, but it also nourished my soul. It gave me the strength and energy I needed to keep going, to keep striving for a better life.\n\nSo if you're feeling lost or unsure of your future, remember that egg bars can be the change you need. They may seem small and insignificant, but they have the power to transform your life in ways you never thought possible. Give them a try, and see how they can change your life for the better.","upvote_ratio":0.46,"created_utc":1678422392.0},{"title":"need ean code from aliexpress pdoduct for amazon listing","author":"lennard1115","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11n59og\/need_ean_code_from_aliexpress_pdoduct_for_amazon\/","text":"hi!, so im trying to buy some things off aliexpress which i know are good quality cause i bought them for myself and sell them for a little higher price on amazon. i buy the products in advance from aliexpress and have my own stock so its not dropshipping at all. now te problem is i got to find the ean or different product id code to add to my amazon listing. ive found that theres a code in the url of the item page, but this gives me an error. thanks in advance for the help","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678399299.0},{"title":"I have a decent business plan, including some crude models for my product.

TikTok\u2019s Carousel format is organic but it\u2019s bad \n\nLast year, Business insider talked to Tiktok team and they found out that tiktok is trying to make an average user more engaging & trying to be like Instagram to make the platform easier to post content. \n\nWhich lead to Tiktok launching carousels to make it easier to post imagery content. And since the launch, this format is more organic than any other feature on platform. \n\nBut again the problem here is adult content, people are adding adult imagery content in between images to escape the content violation. \n\nOverall it\u2019s organic for businesses to use now but at the same time children are getting pitched adult content through it. \n\n***Another Good news:*** Tiktok announced \u201cSound for Business\u201d update to make it easier to use sounds without legal approvals. Bc\n\n#3. Pinterest\u2019s New Ad Format is game changing \n\nPinterest is very limited as your industry defines how well your Ads will perform. But to target a broad audience, they have introduced a premium Ad spot. \n\nYou can book a 24-hour spot on Pinterest search page where the platform will preview your Ad for a whole day. This format is a great opportunity for advertisers to generate brand awareness. But still the format if is expanded to more & more advertisers. It can change how Pinterest advertising works for a business. \n\n#4. Newsletters are the future of LinkedIn & WhatsApp \n\nLinkedIn is doing a great job with Newsletters & they have added features like one-click subscribe to make it easier for people to subscribe. \n\nWhatsApp is also working on newsletters feature to help WhatsApp communities & Brands reach their audiences more frequently and get better conversions. \n\nThe reason newsletters are growing, the content deliverability is improved and brands can reach their followers without dependence on the algorithm. \n\nSocial media platforms working on adding newsletter & community features like IG broadcasts is better for organic growth. \n\nBut at the same time bad for advertising business, these same platforms want you to pay to reach your audience. But that\u2019s also the reason we are seeing rise of paid subscriptions on social media platforms. \n\n#5. Social Marketing is Changing to Community Building \n\nAs I mentioned above social media platforms are moving to paid subscriptions. And that\u2019s a threat to advertisers because there are many challenges coming up like \n\n* Data laws in EU \n* CPM goes higher every year \n* Paid subscription users  \n* Short-form content requiring more efforts \n\nLast year not a single platform expect Tiktok showed growth in terms of Ad revenue. \n\nThat\u2019s why platforms have been moving to paid subscriptions. And are brands successful with paid features? \n\n* LinkedIn have 236 million paid users\n* Snapchat crossed 2 million users in less than a year since the launch of their paid plan. \n* Meta (IG & FB) is expected to have 100 million paid users by 2025. \n* Twitter Blue was a failure before but the numbers are increasing. \n* Reddit is steadily acquiring more users \n\nNow, Meta has promised advertisers that the paid subscriptions won\u2019t affect advertising business.\n\nBut thinking from Meta\u2019s POV & other platforms, the revenue from subscriptions is easier to grab & lesser work. \n\nWhich leads us to what marketers are doing to survive the changes is community building. \n\nIt\u2019s important to have control over your audience. And that\u2019s why they are focusing on move audiences to private communities, newsletters & platforms like Discord & Slack. To make sure they listen to their audience better & more consistently. \n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t matter Meta, Tiktok or Snapchat get rid of advertisers or ignore them. Community building is one of the important part of social marketing. \n\n#6. Wrapping up with Three other marketing trends regarding Social Media \n\nMeme Marketing is becoming a bigger part of social media strategies as for short form content. Brands have started valuing engagement over conversions. \n\nSocial media managers are taking over influencer roles for brands as the budgets for influencer marketing are shrinking due to recession & inflation. \n\nPeople are calling out human written content as AI wrote it & doubting every single piece of content they see.\n\n\n**Thanks for reading.

As the title says I am trying to scale a business that is pretty unheard of and unknown. Let me explain.\n\nIn October of 2022 I learnt of a new business from a guy I knew. It was cryptorelated where you sell USDT to people. You have your own rate (price on one usdt) and it is usually higher than the market price which makes it profitable. People who cant buy it inside an exchange or whatever can then buy from another person with their own bank or app (like cashapp, paypal etc) directly.   \n\n\nAnyways, the guy explained how he did and everything and after a lot of research and trial I finally found my own way in this odd business and Im pretty much the only guy doing this in some certain countries (2 countries that I have directed to where I sell USDT to those people).

We think bold VCs and brave founders are on two sides of the same coin, so we wanted to share his story here. Hope it's helpful to someone who's looking for a reason to go all-in on their crazy idea.\n\ntl;dr on Mike Maples: He's a superstar on the VC scene. He's been on the Midas List eight times, has taken two companies public, and was an early investor in Twitter, Lyft, & Twitch. But his path to the top wasn't easy. It was filled with doubt, uncertainty, and risky decisions. Sound familiar?\n\n**Here's his story:**\n\nIn 2006, seed funds weren't really a thing. But Mike knew that was about to change.\n\n$500k was the new $5 mil. Founders could prove\/disprove their idea quickly with little cost.\n\nThe startup world needed a \"Super Angel,\" so Mike set out to address this gap with 'Maples Investments.'\n\nMike's first two angel investments were in Twitter and Digg. He was off to a hot start.\n\nSo he raised a fund and his first deal was the\u00a0textbook rental site, Chegg. His\u00a0deal flow burst open. Mike started investing $500k at a time.\n\nLightning kept striking. So he added a partner and officially co-founded Floodgate. He had proven that the \"Super Angel\" model of seed-stage investing could work.\n\nOver the next decade, thousands of seed-stage firms entered the movement Mike started. Competition became fierce. So Mike had a decision to make:\n\nCompete for deals based on Floodgate's brand equity and track record, or find a new way to source investments.\n\nHe took his own advice: \"I tell founders to avoid the comparison game. You want to force a choice, not a comparison.\"\n\nBut Mike's job was to invest. And now instead of investing, he was going to be spending 70% of his time looking for founders before they had even become founders.\n\n\"This is an opportunity to be different.\"\n\nSo he gave himself 1 year before declaring it a failure or going all-in. Even with a definite end date, it was a huge risk.\n\nWhat if Mike was wrong about who was going to be a founder in the first place? Or he picked someone who started a bad company? Or the founder started a company and didn't pick Floodgate as an investor?\n\nStill, Mike moved forward. His decision propelled the firm to new heights. One example:\n\nMike found Qasar Younis in his early days and helped him iterate on his idea of software for the autonomous vehicle industry. When the now-CEO launched Applied Intuition, Floodgate was one of its first investors.\n\nWith this strategy, Floodgate has backed:\n\n\u2022 Twitter. Before it was Twitter.  \n\u2022 Lyft. When it was Zimride.  \n\u2022 Okta. When it was Saasure.  \n\u2022 Twitch. When it was Justin. tv.\n\nIts companies are worth $100B+. To say Mike's decision was successful is an understatement.\n\nWe love this story because Mike was prepared to be very wrong at multiple points throughout his career. He put in the risky work upfront to divert from the crowd. And reaped the benefits of wild success after he proved out his hypotheses.\n\n**That's how greatness is achieved.**","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678375527.0},{"title":"fashion store owners, help","author":"Santikus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11muz9a\/fashion_store_owners_help\/","text":"Hi everybody!\n\nWondering whoever has an online or physical clothing store (or fashion in general), how do you get models to pose your products?

Social media platforms have made it easier than ever to connect with people from all over the world. However, with so many people vying for attention, it can be challenging to make meaningful connections. In this post, I will share some tips on how to effectively socially network in a digital era and provide an example of a meaningful interaction.\n\nStep 1: Identify your goals\n\nBefore you start networking, it is important to identify your goals. Are you looking for new job opportunities, mentorship, or to expand your professional network? Once you have a clear idea of what you want to achieve, it will be easier to target your efforts.\n\nStep 2: Choose your platforms\n\nThere are numerous social media platforms available today, each with its own unique features and benefits. Consider which platforms are best suited to your goals. For example, LinkedIn is great for professional networking, while Instagram is better for building a personal brand.\n\nStep 3: Engage with others\n\nEngaging with others is key to building meaningful connections. This means liking, commenting, and sharing other people's posts. When you engage with others, it shows that you are interested in what they have to say and that you are willing to invest time in building a relationship.\n\nStep 4: Reach out\n\nOnce you have engaged with someone, it is time to reach out. This could be as simple as sending a message saying how much you enjoyed their post and asking if they would like to connect further. Be sure to personalize your message and explain why you want to connect.\n\nExample interaction:\n\nLet's say you are interested in pursuing a career in marketing, and you come across a post by a marketing professional on LinkedIn. You like the post and leave a comment complimenting their insights. A few days later, you send them a personalized message saying how much you enjoyed their post and asking if they would be willing to chat further about their experiences in the field. They respond positively, and you set up a call. During the call, you ask thoughtful questions and show a genuine interest in their experiences. By the end of the call, you have not only gained valuable insights but also made a meaningful connection.\n\nIn conclusion, effective social networking in a digital era involves identifying your goals, choosing the right platforms, engaging with others, and reaching out with personalized messages. By following these steps and investing time and effort into building relationships, you can make meaningful connections that will benefit you both personally and professionally.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678330298.0},{"title":"Friendly Fraud \/ Chargeback Abuse","author":"RichMango7002","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11mjiar\/friendly_fraud_chargeback_abuse\/","text":"If you're a small business owner or run a SaaS product with a small team, how do you handle customers doing chargebacks?

(for someone whom is underaged)","author":"whynamehardtofind","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11mm2ax\/farmers_market_or_a_website_for_someone_whom_is\/","text":"Hey, long-time lurker here and possible wantrepreneur for the past couple of years but I think I\u2019ve finally found something I\u2019ve been able to stay consistent in which is selling candles! But I\u2019ve come across 2 issues for which I seek advice \n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA bit of an intro: (basically just background knowledge if you are quite busy you can probably just skip to the next section!)\n\n1. I\u2019m currently 16 so I\u2019m underaged and unable to get a decent online storefront due to the fact that the majority of sites require you to be 18+ or have a legal adult sign up for you unforuanltey most sites also ask for an ID and my parents just aren\u2019t comfortable sharing those things, and at the end of the day, I just have to respect that. (I do have listings on Facebook marketplace and a couple of groups) I 100% understand that digital marketing is a huge asset for many businesses nowadays but I think maybe if I can prove to my parents that my model is truly working (I've had my fair amount of failures)  then they may be willing to have a talk and be convinced about making a website and online payments under their name!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. (This one\u2019s not really a problem just a worry) I have just enough money saved up from summer jobs which I have budgeted to start the business but I don\u2019t want to jump into any big purchases before I have validation of my product so still finding a place where I can do that! Here\u2019s a picture of my current product of anyone\u2019s intrested: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/KTHdY8F](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/KTHdY8F) (hopefully this doesn't break subreddit rules!)  if anyones willing to critic my product that would be great! I'm hoping to release 3 different scents to start off with  which are\n\n1: Coffee shop\n\n2: Lavender Fields\n\n3: Watermelon (A bit weird I know haha)\n\n(Big issue is jar supplier still trying to find a good one)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMAIN DILEMMA: \n\nAlright and now for the main dilemma, I can either pay for a website and have someone to design it for me but the hosting of a site cost a decent amount of money and idk if online transactions will really work out for me being underaged, and unable to use parents credentials the benefit of the website is I can do a Pre-sale model although there a huge benefits to this like posting things on tik tok somethnig just doesn't feel right about it and I have worries about it such as attempting to setup payment systems while being underaged.\n\n But alternatively, I could start selling weekly at flea markets and farmer markets which personally feels a lot more right to me it\u2019s just a gut feeling. But this would mean I need to invest more money into stock and supplies which is scary because I don\u2019t know if my products will sell. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo should I risk getting in trouble and possibly losing money by going the online website route? Or should I risk selling in person at markets an risk losing money on supplies?\n\nI also have fears in the back of my mind such as setting up insurance due to the nature of my products being flammable which will likely also require an LLC. I will now go to sleep and will check back in the morning! thanks so much for reading through my semi essay and I can't wait to come back and reply to your responses roast me hard if ya want! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSidenote: Sorry if my whole thing is messy lol typing on mobile and my phone laggy as heck for some reason.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678347199.0},{"title":"Genius idea you can have for free","author":"dsbtc","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11mtlwb\/genius_idea_you_can_have_for_free\/","text":"1. create llc with german name that has to do with tools or quality or being a professional\n\n2. import a bunch of chinese tools from alibaba\n\n3. hire a german designer on fiverr to make a couple 3d images of the tools\n\n4. repackage tools with new german brand and put \"designed in germany\" on the package\n\n5. list on Amazon for 200% markup\n\nI just looked up a tool on Amazon and they all had these insane alphabet soup names, only one of them had a german sounding name, so I clicked on it even though it was otherwise the same as the rest of them.

Millions of web pages and ads are unread, ignored and abandoned.\n\nThe reason? Boring headlines.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019 Mr. Robot gave us 43 of the most intense, thought-provoking, emotional episodes in television history. Ever.\n\nMr. Robot tells the story of a genius *hacker* and an underground *hacker group (Fsociety)* trying to take down powerful corporations... AND save the World.\n\nIn the second season of Mr. Robot there's this scene when Angela is kidnapped and locked in a dark room. 4 hours later she meets Whiterose.\n\nWhiterose is the leader of the Dark Army, a Chinese hacker group. Angela is a childhood friend of Elliot Alderson (a cybersecurity engineer, hacker...and the main protagonist of Mr. Robot)*.*\n\n*\u200d*So Whiterose says, \"You've been here close to four hours, and you never thought to walk out the door.\"\n\nAngela, puzzled, looks back to the door.\n\nThen she says, \"The door was locked.\n\nWhiterose replies, \"I\u2019ve always found doors fascinating inventions. They hold the entry to unlimited imagination.\"\n\nThen she adds, \"Before you open any door, a World filled with possibilities sits right behind it. And it isn\u2019t until you open it they are realized. Such potential they bring to our minds. And yet a lock stopped you from all of that. How...lazy. \"\n\nEvery trade has it tricks. You see, in copywriting, getting people's attention is the job of the headline.\n\nThat's why headlines are like doors. They serve as the connecting link to new possibilities on the other side.\n\nIn other words, the #1 job of your website headline is to get people to read your second sentence.\n\n\u200dOR as as ad legend David Ogilvy once said, \"It's the ticket on the meat\". But the reader will never read past the headline unless what you have to say is clear AND relevant to the reader.\n\nRemember, a headline is a story.\n\nYou either make it intriguing, or you make it forgettable.\n\n**When writing headlines consider using one of these 17 techniques that have been proven to work by real sales tests.\u200d**\n\nMost homepage headlines are so buzzword-y they sound like they were written by a lawyer. These writing techniques and headline formulas are good enough to help you craft headlines far more believable, more vivid and more persuasive than any headline written by the average fluff AI copywriting tools out there.\n\n# Type of headline: News Headlines\n\n  \n\u200d\u200dNews headlines work because they are good pullers. They\u2019re fabulously effective (when used correctly) in getting attention and promoting sales.  \nSo use them if you\u2019re launching new products (or things that you want to be perceived as new).  \n\u200d  \n**1.

This does have the added benefit though of the managers being able to see all correspondence between the workers and management.

With two friends of mine, we joined and created a berth booking platform (Berth= spot to park your boat in a marina). One of my friends is a sailor who came op with the idea because when he was sailing back at home he hhad the option to email, call or show up and ask at a marina if there is any berth available. During the summer, when it is very busy on the water, The chance is big that there isn't a berth available.\n\nWe though we might could turn this customer pain into an opportunity. That is why we were developing an website and app were boaters can see availability of nearby marina's for their boat measurements specific and book a spot directly. As easy as that quick, easy booking a secured spot.\n\nWe found out that the boaters community loves this idea and a lot of them were willing to pay a little extra to give them this convienient way of booking. \nHowever, our problem is on the other side of the platform: the marina's. Although we can offer marina's an more automized way of handeling bookings, leading to less time and more customers, a lot of marina's want to keep full control over their booking and keep their current booking system. Also since a lot of them have a high ocupancy rate, they don't feel the need for this change.\n\nSo this where the story ends for now. We learned a lot until now and I really would like to continue in entrepreneurship and make this opportunity work.\nDo you have any advice on how to change the business idea to make a viable business out of this?

I am, however, still planning to go college nonetheless to gain new perspective (overseas exchange maybe) and also network and stuff;\n\n### How to focus on becoming a tech founder in college?\n- In high school, I did ALL SORTS of things and I felt like I learned SO SO much. I'm not saying I'm a damn genius now, but I feel like doing these things on a repeat in college would be less productive.\n- I found my love for entrepreneurship in high school and I deeply believe that my time in college should be to work toward actually becoming a tech entrepreneur rather than grinding for good grades and trying to be president of all clubs.\n- Now the challenge is I'm not sure what's the \"best thing to do\" if tech entrepreneurship is my goal in college. I trust that an experienced mentor's guidance would be immensely valuable and I would love to hear any advice at all!\n\nTLDR; I learned a lot in high school through being heavily involved in everything and I don't think I want to do this on a repeat in college, because my primary goal is tech entrepreneurship.

Today I decided to look for some feedback and tips!\n\nToday I decide to share another story about my journey with my startup [Affistash](https:\/\/affistash.com\/companies) \\- Growing partnership\/affiliate programs using AI\n\nSince I reached a new milestone in MRR, I decided to write a short post where I will share things I think I did right, but also some things that I think I did wrong, so I hope you enjoy and if you have any tips or feedback, I am looking forward to it : )\n\n\ud83d\udccdAfter 70 days of Affistash here are the stats that I managed to achieve:\n\n\ud83d\udcb8MRR: 400$  \n\u2b50Marketers: 948  \n\ud83d\udcbcCompanies: 9\n\nI am content with my current results, but there is always room for a lot of improvement. Anyway, here are some things that I think I did good:\n\n1. Using live demos to close deals: Since my startup operates B2B, but also B2C, I always liked to do meetings with the companies that wanted to use Affistash to grow their affiliate\/partnership programs, I feel like the communication is way smoother, and statistically it worked better for me, than just a simple application form.\n2. Finding mentors: In the last few weeks I have been on a mission to find people in the SaaS world that I can follow and talk to. I always felt like I was lacking in that aspect, but fortunately, lately I had the chance to speak to lots of other experienced founders that helped me with tips and suggestions :)\n3. Posting a lot on Indiehackers, Reddit, Twitter, PH: Being consistent on these platforms helped me reach lots of business owners that were happy to try my product and get their company listed. Most of them were happy with the results, a couple of them decided to leave, but I am aware that partnership programs don't work for any type of business.\n\nI am looking to grow Affistash to $2k MRR by June, so I have a few things that I am looking to improve to reach that goal:\n\n1. Start doing some outbound marketing\n2. Implement tools feature for marketers and business owners, something that many of our users requested\n3. Looking for some accelerators and incubators - I think that would be a game changer for my SaaS, so I started to search for some fundraising since I started seeing consistency in the revenue growth\n\nHope you found this interesting and I am more looking forward to your guys feedback : )\n\nCheers!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678313526.0},{"title":"From Zero to $5000\/month in 5 months - Can AutoUnsubscribe.me Hit $5000\/Month with 30 Days left?","author":"swalden123","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11mhl7r\/from_zero_to_5000month_in_5_months_can\/","text":"There is over just one month left for me to get to $5000 monthly recurring revenue in [My Web App Challenge: From Zero to $5000\/month in 5 months](https:\/\/spencerwalden.com.au\/my-web-app-challenge-from-zero-to-5000-month-in-5-months\/).\n\nThe problem? I\u2019m at $20.\n\nThe app I\u2019m building lets you automatically unsubscribe from unwanted emails that you never open, so you can focus on the emails that matter, saving yourself time and effort. You can see it here: [AutoUnsubscribe.me](https:\/\/autounsubscribe.me\/).\n\nI\u2019ve left launching too late, I feel the idea is valid as I\u2019ve had a lot of interest and have managed to get my first few paying customers who have found my app by googling and finding my Reddit posts. However $5000 with only one month left to market is a tough goal. I\u2019m going to give it my best.\n\nI regret setting a monetary goal. There are a few reasons for this:\n\n* It focused too much on the destination, rather than enjoying the journey itself.\n* It took away the joy of creating.\n* The goal was not quite immediate enough to spur me into the action I hoped it would\n* I would prefer to focus on building an amazing product, then the outcome.\n\nI didn\u2019t start Indie Hacking to get rich \u2013 I started it because I wanted to live a life full of creativity and passion. For me, Indie Hacking is more than just a way to make money \u2013 it\u2019s a way to build things that I\u2019m truly passionate about and that bring value to people\u2019s lives. I believe that Indie Hacking can lead to a fulfilling lifestyle that allows you to work on projects you love and make a positive impact on the world.\n\nWhen I first posted this challenge, I was blown away by the sheer number of people obsessed with validating their ideas. I get it \u2013 validation is important. But what many fail to realize is that it\u2019s not enough to just throw up a landing page and call it a day. You need to show something real, something that people can touch, feel, and use. That\u2019s the only way to truly validate an idea. A mere email list won\u2019t cut it. So, while I\u2019m all for validation, I believe it\u2019s time to stop obsessing over it and start focusing on what really matters: creating something of value that people will love and pay for.\n\nI instead used my own experience, gut feeling and intuition. I spent a few months building out an MVP then I am about to fully launch. The biggest mistake I\u2019ve made so far is waiting too long to launch, as perhaps I put too much pressure on it.\n\nEven if this fails and never amounts to anything, I\u2019ll be happy either way. Not everything has to be validated, or for a purpose. No time is truly wasted. I\u2019ve seen people trying to validate ideas for years, where they could have built 10 products in that time. Even if none took off that\u2019s some very valuable experience.\n\nIt\u2019s time to launch and do my best for the next month.

Sadly it was also the best experience I've had working in someone else's company.\n\nI'm training my 2nd employee right now and thinking back to those days. Of course I don't kid myself that in reality, as companies grow, the culture gets harder and harder to influence as a leader and it eventually takes the shape of the individuals involved. But that's a good thing. \n\nThat's because I've noticed that when you are the leader and you actually trust your people and empower them to figure things out, and when you treat them like an equal without any of the status\/power headgames, and when you compensate them fairly for their wins, your people start to mirror you and genuinely enjoy the work, putting extra time and effort into what they do.\n\nEvery leader I've ever worked for cautioned against treating people that report to me as an equal because you can't control how they do the work.

The more you can standardize and optimize your process, the less painful it'd be. If you can then outsource that process or parts of it to either somebody else or a bot, even better!\n\nI own an automation agency( [lunadawn.dev](https:\/\/lunadawn.dev) ) and people often ask me how to DIY automation for their business, so here's a bunch of tools and advice (I am not affiliated with any of these tools)\n\n1. [zapier.com](https:\/\/zapier.com) : Perhaps the king of modern automation, Zapier lets you create 'zaps' that automatically do things like sending emails, scheduling calendar events etc etc\n2. [ifttt.com](https:\/\/ifttt.com\/)\/[make.com\/](http:\/\/make.com\/): Zapier competitors. IFTT is free.\n3. [slack.com](https:\/\/slack.com): A lot of people benefit from slack bots, and slack has a large marketplace where you can select bots to automate your workflows\n\nBut what If I don't want to or can't use those tools? Hope is not lost! Because just about any process on the internet can be automated, even if it's not supported by automation tools. Here's a few tools that can let you make bots:\n\n1. [bubble.io](https:\/\/bubble.io) \\- Simple enough, [bubble.io](https:\/\/bubble.io) lets you build any kind of automation without writing code. But it can still get extremely complex!\n2. RPA (Robotic Process Automation) - RPA is able to automatically click buttons, fill text fields etc on any website. It is a very useful tool, though it comes with a learning curve.\n3. Hire a professional - In the end, you can spend days struggling with [bubble.io](https:\/\/bubble.io) or RPAs, or you can hire a specialist. Professional bot developers are also able to implement a lot of things that are simply impossible with off-the-shelf tools\n\nIf anybody has any questions about automation, please post a comment!

Founder and CEO of Rootmate.\n\n**Tell me about Rootmate.**\n\nRootmate is an e-commerce of design pieces, right now they are specifically pots. The core of Rootmate began as \u201cthe design for a love of plants\u201d. I am an interior designer and before that I had an interior design studio with which we did very well, we were nominated for studio of the year with several projects. When I had the studio, I noticed the gap in the market for design pots. It took me some time to really think about this idea and decide to close the studio so I could fully launch Rootmate. From the very start we wanted design pots that were very easy to buy and that were very easy to put somewhere. In other words, we wanted to make it painless for the consumer from the very start of buying the pot, receiving it, accommodating it within the home. \n\nPersonally, I am very picky with my space, and I like to go around my space and you know, adjust the tiny 3 centimetres. When these were heavy pots, it was terrible. In client projects we suffered. We would say, \u201cHey, that one looks better over here.\u201d Bringing over the piece to the other side of the room required four people! With all this in mind, I said to myself: \u201cOne day I'm going to close the studio to start my own pots company.\u201d This is what the core of Rootmate is now - a design for a love of plants. We launched Rootmate in October of 2020 and we slowed down a bit the production of our products because of the pandemic. \n\nWe carry the bigger sized pots and we just launched one type for the desk, but we are going to launch new products soon. Right now, Rootmate is based in Guadalajara, and as you can tell by the name, the brand was designed with the intention of selling the products in the United States. Currently due to lack of production, we are only selling in Mexico. 50% of our sales come from the general public market. These sales come from our website and publicity on Instagram. The other 50% are designers and architects who buy from us for hotels, their projects, etc. \n\n**What inspired you to create Rootmate?** \n\nThe lack of product in the market. The truth is that if nobody is going to make these design pots, I\u2019ll just make them myself! In the studio, we used to order to make so many things, around 70% of the things we put into a project. Pots was something we never could do, especially design pots with cool colors that matched the room aesthetic and the paint on the walls. So yeah, this was where we went, \u201cThis is definitely needed!\u201d \n\n**Tell me about what you do on a typical day. What do you do at your job?** \n\nThis year we\u2019ve started with a ton of new recruits, a lot of new faces for the company. We have new people in the factory as well as on the administrative side. With the administrative team we have stand-up meetings. Here, anyone can talk for 15 minutes or less about what they did yesterday, what they\u2019re going to do today, what\u2019s going on with a task or project, what the challenges are. Every day my mornings start with these stand-ups. I have to organize myself every morning for these meetings. After that I start to review with my team on one on ones if needed and anything that\u2019s pending from my side to approve or review. \n\nI also take care of recruitment and that requires a lot of my time, around 20%. I also take care of alliances with designers, alliances with new suppliers, etc. That's also like 30% of my time. I has have a big presence on the creative side, our creative direction, the new products, shootings, etc. In general, this is another 20% of my time. Day to day mornings I go to the office or the factory, I go two days to the factory and three to the office if my team\u2019s there. As you can see, depending on the issue, whether administrative or on the manufacturing side, I go to the team with whom I\u2019m going to resolve the problems with. Finally, in the afternoons is when I can focus on corrections that I have to make or revisions that I have to concentrate on, things that I have to write or interviews I\u2019m scheduled for, I do all this in the afternoon. \n\n**What do you love about what you do?**\n\nI love being on the go! I love having so many things to do all the time and I love my team. We call our team the \u201cMates\u201d. The \u201cRooties\u201d are the pots, the market already knows they\u2019re called the \u201cRooties\u201d, which is an incredible feat we\u2019ve accomplished. No other company has \u201cRooties\u201d nor our \u201cMates\u201d! Anyways, what I love is being active every single day, working with the \u201cMates\u201d on a daily basis and growing and strengthening the team. \n\n**What\u2019s the hardest part about what you do?** \n\nBuilding good teams! The hardest thing about Rootmate is the manufacturing of the pieces. It\u2019s a complex process, incredibly inefficient. I design products that are very inefficient to manufacture so that\u2019s the biggest Rootmate problem. On my side, the hardest part is building the team and managing the people. \n\n**Tell me about some plans Rootmate has for the near future.** \n\nRecently we\u2019ve changed our focus which was on \u201cthe design for a love of plants\u201d to \u201cthe design for a love of life and style\u201d. We want to grow our product line so it\u2019s more in line with the home d\u00e9cor lifestyle. That will be a great step for us. Right now we have six products \u2013 three designs in different sizes. We also want our new products to be printed by 3D printers. We want to build a huge farm of 3D printers that will allow us to launch more products. Our other big goal is to build a store next year in Mexico, our first store, and begin to export to other countries in 6 months. \n\n**What do you want to learn?**\n\nBe a better leader!

I want to keep things very simple and not have food, but instead, there will be a focus on aesthetics and lifestyle through the store's interior design and branded goods (cups, reusable mugs, totes). Aesthetics tend to be the drawing factor besides cup quality, for social media marketing as well as just to lure customers in with a trendy minimalistic design. I also plan to utilize a website to sell all these goods and expand my reach beyond just the physical location.  \n\nThere are also plans to use the larger stores as a space for group cupping events, to encourage knowledge sharing with customers, and to keep within the community amongst enthusiasts.   \n\n\nI understand this is no easy task and many posts have warned about coffee shops being very low profit, but I can't seem to take this advice to heart since the offerings and business models are very different.   \n\n\nJust for perspective, there are less than a dozen coffee shops offering specialty coffee in the lower mainland of my city. The mass majority are second wave focusing on starbucks-like offerings with baked goods and deli foods. \n\nMy estimate of the initial investment is $150,000 CAD for the equipment, interior design, and construction.","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1678238486.0},{"title":"How long did it take your trademark to go through?","author":"Beautiful-Ice7622","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11lvvj1\/how_long_did_it_take_your_trademark_to_go_through\/","text":"It had to have been 6-8 months ago for me and my lawyer likes to charge me $50 every time he \u201cchecks\u201d the status.

For reference, the highest quote is 50% higher than lowest one. \n\nI want to go with higher price higher quality manufacturer, but also want their price to be lowered.

I'm going back to this paragraph now as I type and realize a few things, that this post is pretty disorganized as I rewrote it from an old post in \/r\/juststart which I recommend to anyone looking to learn about niche websites. The details are far to much to type out in this post, I'll try to answer specific questions as I get them.\n\nI was able to achieve passive income with a niche website monetized with an ebook (eventually added 3 more ebooks), a paid membership and ad revenue with a staff that I outsourced all necessary duties to. I spent $0 on ads to get the sales, everything came organically through SEO.  \n\n\n*Timeline*\n\nI started my niche website at the end of 2016. The first 2 years were pretty slow but by early 2018 I made enough to live and travel around cheap parts of Asia and decided to make the full time jump.  Year 3 is when things started really taking off-- all the efforts started to compound.  At the peak in 2020, I was generating close to $20,000 per month in  digital sales revenue on around 100K users per month, including about $4,000 in recurring membership revenue.\n\nOn top of digital product revenue, I was receiving payments from advertisers at around $1500 per month from a private ad network for display ads and also landed a sponsorship deal that paid $16,800 up front and up to $1750 per month additionally.\n\nCosts to operate started around $1000 then grew to $5,000-$8,000 per month and would have been significantly less had I not delegated basically all of the work and paid my staff generously as I was travelling extensively and surfing a ton, living the \"4 hour workweek\".  I actually didn't intend to fully sell the website and was upset with how the deal ended up (started with a partial equity sale), but I now know to be a lot more intentional when starting a business and who I choose to partner with.  \n\n\n*What tools I actually used, investment, and what my team looked like*\n\nI started everything with under $100: I wrote the eBook in Adobe acrobat PDF, simply bought a domain on Namecheap, hosted it on Siteground and had a sales page on Wordpress and fulfilled all sales initially through a free plugin called Easy Digital Downloads and eventually through Woocommerce.  \n\n\nI had a Youtube channel in the niche that brought in the initial sales as the website started to rank on Google.\n\nI actually knew very little about SEO and I didn't do any keyword research initially, I simply answered questions in my niche that I knew people would value in the form of articles, and I wrote news on high traffic topics with the unique lens and data points of my website to provide the reader value.   \n\n\nI was producing about 3 articles\/week and 1-3 youtube videos per week as my website grew and started to get 5000-10000 in traffic per month and making $1000-$2500 per month.  \n\n\nWhen I broke $3K, I decided to start hiring writers who I found from my email list (I actually hired the bulk of my team from my email list). My first writer eventually opened up running a paid forum which I priced at $40\/month.  \n\n\nI hit $10K \/ month at the end of 2019 and throughout 2020 I was brushing $20K\/month. I was netting about 40%, spending money on devs and paying for SEO but I was pretty bad at hiring contractors so got ripped off a few times paying for services I didn't need or those that didn't turn out as expected.  \n\n\nYears 3-4, unless something major happened like the website going down or if I was building out a new product, my workweek though consisted of paying people and doing meetings\/some check ins with the team for a total of less than 10 hours\/week.  \n\n\nI had delegated email marketing, article writing, management of the article writing, social media posting and customer service.  \n\n\nSo to summarize the nuts and bolts of the business, it was a niche website monetized by ebooks, ad revenue, and a forum that was promoted entirely through SEO -- consistent publishing of articles around the niche which caused the website to grow over time. As the numbers got more serious, I hired help for SEO\/web design which had hit and miss results but basically I didn't learn the technical skills myself for these things, I was able to hire these out.  \n\n\n*Mindset\/ Soft Skills*\n\n\nI really didn't know what I was doing in the beginning, I was just curious and I pursued and learned along the way, and I attribute a lot my success to instinct and my optimistic mindset. I know a lot of people hate to hear this because they consider it fluff, but 2 key points I want to get across are:\n\n*Know your audience by being them first.*\n\nI made my website as the solution I wish I had when I was dealing in my niche. I knew I could make a resource better than anything out there, and with that in mind, I was able to write articles initially without doing any keyword research for the first 2 years and ranking #1 on Google for many associated keywords.\n\nPerhaps a bit of luck was involved but you have to remember, the inputs of search terms on Google come from real people who want answers to questions-- I simply wrote articles that answered every single question that I had about my niche -which brings me to my second point:\n\n*People want answers to complex questions within the areas of health, wealth and love, and they'll pay for efficient solutions.*\n\nThat's why I was able to sell my ebook for $47 a pop which earned over $250,000 in sales in its lifetime. The process of writing my ebook was fairly simple-- I simply compiled all questions I and others had in my niche, and I organized everything and came up with a catchy title.\n\nFinding order in a world of chaos in the form of a clear solution is something that all humans want, so creating this solution is what product market fit is. I also tested this early on with a Udemy course on the topic before I went through the whole process of pushing my site, and when that did well I knew the concept would scale to my website.  \n\n\n*Be a visionary with a strong mission, and you'll attract a team and customers*\n\nThinking back on what I did right, I think this might be one of the biggest things that helped. If you can't tell by how I'm writing this post, I'm super ADD, definitely not the brightest, but I always had a strong intention to build something helpful, and I think purity and alignment in this intention is critical to long term success.  \n\n\n Think of the whole passive income thing like a seed of intention that you're planting that you water with effort and as it grows you eventually get help to tend to it, but at a certain point it becomes self sufficient and bears fruit--it's at this stage that you have passive income.\n\nI was able to shortcut small initial successes with 2 new products by using this mindset, and I'm scaling a third product now with the same system I used to make my first.  \n\n\n*Mistakes\/pitfalls of the \"four hour workweek\"\/passive income\"*\n\n\nOne thing about passive income is that it requires maintenance. Obvious, I'm sure but I was so used to not working and having money print basically that I made major mistakes towards the end of the journey. I messed up by raising my expenses for the sake of having pure passive income and being super out of touch with my business in the end as it began to not be so profitable as it used to be, and I ended up in somewhat of a forced sale.\n\n A bunch of other mistakes made like not thoroughly vetting devs, investors, etc, but all in all this was an incredible payoff based on the effort I put into it, and I'm now bootsrapping a new website with this same system and hoping to achieve the same results. \n  \nTL;DR:   \n\n\nI had a go at the \"Four hour workweek\" business model and somewhat successfully lived the passive income lifestyle and was able to make a full time remote income for 3 years with an eBook + paid membership built on organic traffic from a niche site which was fueled primarily by article writers and email marketing which I both outsourced.  Messed up bad on the tail end of it and the exit though, doing my best to start again\nSome Proof: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/DB6G5tz](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/DB6G5tz)","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678155292.0},{"title":"Can i get your video maker contact?","author":"No-Establishment3985","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11ldco0\/can_i_get_your_video_maker_contact\/","text":"Are there succesfull youtube cash cow channel owners who can help me ?\n\nI want to grow i got 50\u20ac budget per video\n\ni need to have a list with good editors etc\n\ni dont find good ones on fiverr and upwork , now looking on reddit thanks bro","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678227564.0},{"title":"Starting a long-term storage business on 5 acres of land near major metro area?","author":"wkern74","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11l66si\/starting_a_longterm_storage_business_on_5_acres\/","text":"Hey there, my in-laws have about 5 acres of nice land 40 min from a major metro area and I was thinking of starting up some sort of long-term storage business.

I always wonder who you guys really are.\n\n\\- A 24 year old waiter in St Louis desperately wanting to start a dropshipping empire?  \n\\- A 30 year old gamer girl with cat ears in Albany?\n\n\\- A 45 year old dad that hates his day job in Salt Lake City?\n\nIts always intriguing to meet you guys. The group chat was fun btw. I got to chime in about visibility.   \nOk, enough daydreaming. \n\nCourses are still an excellent way to generate revenue despite the animosity some people have for them. I have probably earned over $35k with no ads ever and my member reviews were really good. \n\nIf you want to get into courses, you need to first learn what a BAD ONE looks like.   \nThanks to Tai Lopez, JT Foxx and Kimra Luna, we have a perfect model of what not to do if you have any scrap of morality and business ethics: \n\n\\- You need to price to results. If 85% of people got strong results from your course, you're doing well. Remember that many people buy courses and just don't do the work. That's their choice, not yours. If you create strong content and tactics, your students should thrive. \n\n\\- Don't be a shitbag and offer payments for a 16% interest bump. Don't ever encourage people to go into debt to buy your course. (If they are that broke, I can almost guarantee your course will NOT magically make them successful overnight). \n\n\\- Don't teach things you aren't an expert at (cough Tai L cough). Anyone with an IQ of a radish can get on ChatGPT, churn out some shitty how tos, and film a few videos and call that a \"course\" The problem with this is that you are selling low value info and taking people's money while not actually helping them. \n\n\\- DO NOT MARKET LIKE A SHITBAG. Making comments about implied future income or \"I'll teach you to be rich overnight\" or having shitty ads with money raining down on you is predatory and scummy. If you cannot produce results from your course, you need to sit down, and actually create better tactics and content and GET results with your students\/clients \n\nNow that you know what a bad course looks like, here are the hallmarks of a good one:  \n\\- Strong production value that looks good, this includes hosting site, videos, PDFs, training guides, etc\n\n\\- A proven track record for past students and attendees. You should have case studies and easily accessible results\n\n\\- ***IMPORTANT*** \\- quality of information. I am foot stomping this. Low value information is subject based in nature. It just has a general overview. This is what the gurus put out and why they have such a high refund rate. High value information is at the tactics\/strategy level and teaches: How to\/checklists\/unique info\/effective websites\/apps\/programs\/a process that worked well for you and your students \n\n***EXAMPLE****:* \n\nThis is the difference:  \nLow quality: A course about Chat GPT (Teaches WHAT)\n\nHigh quality: 20 prompts to optimize Chat GPT\/Brief history\/10 Industries and How to Use It\/Money Making Potential\/Weaknesses and Cautions\/How to Sign up\/Competitors in the Market\/Step by Step: How I Used It To Generate $5k in a Month (Teaches WHY\/HOW)\n\nIf you guys are thinking about courses, I HIGHLY encourage it. Remember, don't focus on the money and sales. Focus on actually solving someone's problem and helping them thrive. \n\nPRO TIP:   \nRemember that courses are Do it yourself, Done With You or Done For you. Price higher as you get more involved. Don't let some of the negative people in here dissuade you from pricing higher **IF YOUR COURSE IS WORTH IT AND YOU HAVE RESULTS.** \n\nIf you need results, create a low cost course and improve. \n\nIf you have course questions, reach out. - Rob The Warrior Strategist","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678211247.0},{"title":"Lost interest on my hustle because it doesnt seem fun anymore","author":"horsearound8","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11l1xi6\/lost_interest_on_my_hustle_because_it_doesnt_seem\/","text":"I apologize if this isnt technically the right sub but I was hoping to read some input on my position.

I am posting this with utmost humility, seeking advice from the Reddit community on how to take the project to the next level, as it is not as easy as it seems to make certain decisions.\n\nTo give some context, I am a young guy of 23 years. I have always enjoyed video editing, creating things with music in general, and the world of 3D. One day by chance, I saw a project similar to mine and it inspired me (Kizuna Ai). I trained and learned a lot to achieve the videos that you can see on my social media today.\n\nThroughout this process, I have tried many things in order to establish the KiraRem brand and give the best content to my followers. In one of these attempts, I met a girl who was interested in the project and began streaming with the KiraRem avatar, just like many Vtubers do today. Although the project was REALLY DOING WELL, I didn't see myself working with this person in the long term, so we decided to part ways. I think that if I entrust the voice of the character to someone else, in the end if something happens with the girl, the project will not be able to move forward since the identity will have been lost. In summary, I didn't see a long-term future in the terms we were in. It would be different if there was a company involved and they managed the situation with contracts, but as an individual, I felt overwhelmed by the situation of having to entrust the project that I was dedicating so much time to a single person, feeling that they could leave at any time.\n\nSo what am I looking for by writing this post if it seems like there is no future? I am looking for ways to collaborate with companies and partners who share our passion for technological innovation and high-quality content. I am interested in any advice they may have on how to find suitable partners and establish successful relationships. The biggest problem I have faced in this project is precise that I am alone, if I could get a suitable team, I could achieve results such as [**https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@apoki\\_vv\/videos**](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@apoki_vv\/videos). Right now, I am not interested in making a profit, I would love to see the project grow, as I have managed to create a very united and strong community and I would not like to waste its full potential. I have many ideas that could make the project more than profitable in the long run, but right now I lack a team and obviously, the capital.\n\nI appreciate any advice that can be offered and hope to work together to take KiraRem to new levels of success.

It's the daily effort we put in, day in and day out, that adds up to something great.\n\nThink about it like this: if you were building a house, would you lay a brick one day and then wait a week before laying another? Of course not! You would work diligently every day, laying brick after brick until the house was complete. The same goes for building a successful business.\n\nWe often hear about the overnight success stories, but what we don't hear about are the countless hours of hard work and consistency that went into making that success a reality. It's like the old saying goes - Rome wasn't built in a day \n\nConsistency is not easy, but it's necessary. It requires discipline, focus, and a strong sense of purpose. And just like a muscle that needs to be exercised, consistency needs to be practiced every single day.\n\nSo, my fellow entrepreneurs, I urge you to commit to consistency in everything you do. Whether it's waking up early to work on your business, or making that extra phone call to a potential client, every little effort adds up.\n\nDon't let the fear of failure or the temptation of giving up stop you from achieving your dreams. Remember, every great success story started with small consistent efforts.\n\nLet us all strive to be the consistent bricklayers of our dreams, building a strong foundation that will support our businesses for years to come. Let us not falter in our efforts, but instead rise up and meet every challenge with steadfast consistency.\n\nAs Martin Luther King Jr. said, \"If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.\"\n\nLet's keep moving forward, my friends, with consistency as our guide.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour Kind Cousin\n\nMastermindM","upvote_ratio":0.61,"created_utc":1678174131.0},{"title":"I sucked at coming up with business ideas. So I built The Startup Idea Firehose. I tried to monetize it, but the market response is a huge flop. Feedback on the value of the tool\/website?","author":"What_The_Hex","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11l4b4g\/i_sucked_at_coming_up_with_business_ideas_so_i\/","text":"Here is the website \u2192 [https:\/\/startupideafirehose.com\/](https:\/\/startupideafirehose.com\/)\n\nBasically here's the background behind this tool: I was trying to come up with a business idea for something that's truly valuable, and something that's innovative in the sense that something like it doesn't exist. I also wanted the idea to solve some problem I personally had so it would provide value to me. I realized one of my biggest current problems was just my inability to come up with original business ideas. So I set out to create an online tool for this.\n\nThere were a few shitty \"online business generator\" tools, but all of them sucked. They would just like, randomly match a few random nouns and adjectives together: \"You should start a \\[cafe\\] for \\[senior citizens\\]\", etc.\n\nSomething else I realized was, one of the main pieces of advice you'll get for, how to find business ideas? Is to go to social media and search for posts that contain pain points, frustrations, ideas for businesses, etc etc. And I had personally spent some time on Twitter in the past finding potential business ideas using the right keyword search terms. The thing is, THAT process sucked because for every legitimate idea you'll find, there's a ton of fluff.\n\nSo I set out to build a tool that would basically compile, filter, and centralize a huge library of business ideas -- so for users it would just be like drinking from a firehose of business ideas. How I actually went about building this was pretty complicated, because on the back-end there's a lot of filters in place, using both regex and also integrations with GPT3, to effectively search Twitter using combinations of hundreds of keyword search terms, then filter the raw results using a bunch of complicated criterias, to have the end result be: business ideas. They're then categorized so people can fine-tune by Product, Service or Software based on their needs -- and they can also refine further by searching for business ideas that include a certain keyword. Then users can also save ideas they like, shit-test ideas by basically prompting themselves with a bunch of questions that help to challenge each idea to decide if it's truly a good one or not, then finally, users can speed the whole process up using keyboard shortcuts so they can just blaze through it very quickly.\n\nThe end-goal of this tool was basically: Help entrepreneurs quickly find business ideas that meet their ideal criteria, by coming to this website, selecting the type of business idea they're looking for, further refining the criteria if needed, then BAM, just get a ton of REAL ideas coming from REAL people, about potential businesses to start, or potential problems they could solve in a way that they could monetize. For example, me personally? I'm interested in starting a software business, so I use the tool by selecting only Software Ideas, then as needed I'll further refine by searching for ideas that include a keyword like \"chrome extension\" or \"GPT3\" or something like that. Then it's just, bing, bing, bing, software idea after software idea after software idea, in a rapid-fire manner -- and it's simply way faster than me sitting around with a pen and notepad trying to rack my brain to come up with some ideas on my own.\n\nI thought the market response would be very positive, since one of the main complaints you hear from aspiring entrepreneurs is: They can't come up with ANY good business ideas that are actually somewhat original and innovative; everything else already has 20 companies already doing it. I also thought the response would be positive because, it's not like these are just some randomly generated ideas; these are actual ideas that real-live people are presenting, for products, services or software that would enhance the quality of their lives and solve some real problem that they have in some real way. That, plus the speed behind using the tool to find ideas, in my view made it a really good way to provide value to entrepreneurs by helping them to find good ideas that real people are expressing actual demand for.\n\nThe market response is just not what I expected. So far I've only had ONE person pay to use the premium version of the tool (which allows unlimited daily access), and on any given day, only about 5-10% of people even use the tool enough that they hit the \"daily limit\". That means 90-95% of people land on the website, use it briefly, then bail and decide that they just don't want to use the tool. In other words that effectively means that 90-95% of people in the target market aren't even interested in using a FREE VERSION of the tool -- let alone paying for it.\n\nBottom line, the market simply doesn't seem interested in using the tool and doesn't view it as providing enough value. I'm fine with accepting that fact, and I'm not going to run around trying to save face and defend the value of a tool and claim that the marketplace is somehow wrong or foolish when the actual target market is plainly telling me that it's NOT very valuable.\n\nI AM curious about what others think-- and especially what other entrepreneurs think about this tool.\n\nOne quick point: I know the UI looks pretty crappy and basic. This is the v1 version of the tool that I am testing the market response with. Yes it's not going to win design awards, yes there should be a dark mode and it should look better. It's simply the functional version I launched with to test the market response. If the response was better, I would absolutely improve the visual appearance of the tool. I'm looking more for feedback about: The actual value of the tool itself that it provides or doesn't provide to users.\n\nThanks!","upvote_ratio":0.47,"created_utc":1678207495.0},{"title":"Sharing a very costly and dumb mistake I did in the first year of business so that maybe someone can learn from it and not repeat the same..RANT \u2b07\ufe0f","author":"Snoo_37953","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11kesux\/sharing_a_very_costly_and_dumb_mistake_i_did_in\/","text":"I have a product based business and I thought it would help to get mentions of said product in the media\/magazines \n\/articles etc to gain traction.

In a [global survey by Pega](https:\/\/www.pega.com\/future-of-work), 78% of the executives surveyed believe that increasing the use of AI and robots will dramatically reduce the middle management ranks. A [2020 BCG survey](https:\/\/www.bcg.com\/publications\/2020\/end-management-as-we-know-it) declares that \u201ctraditional management has reached a breaking point.\u201d\n\nSo, Who is a manager? A manager is a person who determines or influences the organization\u2019s policies, and supervises a team or a project. The amount of influence on company policy depends on the management level, whether middle or C-level and the amount of focus on building and maintaining teams is dependent on size and scale of responsibility. Your boss may have years of experience under their belt, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re irreplaceable. In fact, managers are some of the easiest people to replicate with AI, and here\u2019s why.  \n\n\n# Economics of the middle layer\n\nLet\u2019s get this simple one out of our way. Managers with heaps of experiences are costly. Managers in Middle layer are almost always costlier than junior individual contributors. Businesses pay more for their knowledge and experience and in return the manager is on the hook for the successful completion of a project or task. Higher the risk, higher the reward.\n\nAI on the flipside is cost-effective. Hiring a human manager can cost a pretty penny, but once you make the initial investment in AI, the cost of maintaining and upgrading it is significantly lower. Today this exists in the shape of variety of tools on subscription models, tomorrow it\u2019ll be a full fledged solution on a payroll. The lack of EQ in AI would also mean that it is also very less likely to ask for a raise.\n\n## Replication and Predictability of a manager\n\nManagers generally tend to have more work experience or knowledge in a domain as compared to young creatives, or professionals. (Because they were there once) As a manager, you\u2019ve probably developed a routine and a way of doing things that works for you. You make decisions based on your experience, and you\u2019ve developed a certain leadership style that suits your personality. And let\u2019s face it, you\u2019re probably not the only manager in the company who\u2019s doing things this way.\n\nThis is precisely why managers are easy to replicate. Because they are more predictable, and there are multiple data points to capture, replicate and train an AI model. AI can analyze the data from multiple managers and identify common patterns and trends, which can be used to create a predictive model of management behavior. With this predictive model, AI can make decisions that are similar to those made by human managers. It will be far more accurate, thanks to the data points, than if we were to make an AI model mimicking a young professional who simply doesn\u2019t have the experience. It can analyze data and make informed decisions based on it, just like a human manager would. All of this, faster and more efficient than any human.  \n\n\n# Managers are bad at forecasting success\n\nIn multiple studies conducted by [Justin Berg](https:\/\/www.gsb.stanford.edu\/faculty-research\/publications\/balancing-creative-high-wire-forecasting-success-novel-ideas), his key finding was simple \u2014 Managers are not always the best at forecasting successful ideas. Berg explains: \u201cWhen we generate ideas, we first engage in *divergent thinking*, which involves searching for novel connections or combinations that may be valuable. After we generate possible ideas, we engage in *convergent thinking* as we evaluate the ideas based on our previous knowledge and experience. Since managers evaluate ideas after creators have generated them, they skip divergent thinking and go straight to convergent thinking.\u201d In evaluating ideas, \u201cconvergent thinking alone is dangerous because you\u2019re just relying on the past,\u201d says Berg. \u201cWhat will succeed in the future may not resemble what succeeded in the past. Divergent thinking helps people stay more open-minded about new ways ideas may succeed.\u201d\n\nThe individual contributor who works in a team, in the same studies, was shown to have better results at predicting successful ideas generated by their peers. That does not mean a manager magically loses creativity at that position, they simply don\u2019t have the most efficient and thoughtful evaluation process. My argument here is that high skilled workers may not require as much supervision as business owners think. AI tools that empower individual creators, creatives and professionals will be able to equip them for proper reporting, self management and data backed decision making, further eliminating a need for the middle layer.  \n\n\n# Is it that bad?\n\nWhile AI has the potential to automate many tasks traditionally performed by managers, there are still some tasks that require the expertise of a seasoned manager. For example, handling complex client relationships, boosting team morale, and negotiating deals are all tasks that require a high level of emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and creativity \u2014 skills that are currently beyond the capabilities of AI.\n\nAny great manager requires a combination of high EQ and IQ, as they need to be able to connect with their team members, handle difficult situations, and make strategic decisions that drive the business forward. These are all tasks that are currently best performed by human managers. However, with the new wave of AI-equipped younger creatives, the role of the traditional manager may become less relevant. AI can handle routine tasks, such as data analysis and workflow management, leaving managers with more time to focus on high-level tasks that require their unique skills and expertise.\n\nIf you\u2019re a manager in a particularly creative environment, it\u2019s time to start collaborating with younger designers and creatives to redefine your role. With the rise of AI, companies need to redesign their work processes to best utilize AI capabilities. This shift will not only disrupt your role but the current structure of organizations, both big and small.  \n\n\n# About me\n\nI'm an industrial Designer in the consumer tech space and deeply interested in technology, culture and creativity.

I am currently working in a Marketing Agency for a niche in my area. The problem I am having is billing for the website\n\nFor the website I want customers to be able to  use the website to book an appointment with the niche. And I'm having a problem trying to figure out how to apply for a  service charge. My first idea was to charge a $5 convenience fee for each booking through the site. But the problem with that is what's to stop the vendors from going around me and doing business directly with the customer after the initial payment.\n\nMy second idea was to set up a month subscription maybe 40$ a month to remain on the site. I haven't done anything like this before so I'm not really sure how to convince someone to pay me 40$ a month from a website that has yet to show results.\n\nAnd my last idea was maybe I could charge them based on how much business I actually bring them so if they only get 0-4 leads because of me it's free that month. But after 4 meaning once they get 5 customers because of me it's 25$ and I could charge 25$ more for each additional 5 customers I bring to them.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this please share any ideas or personal experiences really trying to wrap my head around this situation so I can move on to something else.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678170283.0},{"title":"Branching out into my own thing and the interpretation of my contract agreement with my employer (a cash bonus)","author":"Trustingmeerkat","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11krarc\/branching_out_into_my_own_thing_and_the\/","text":" Hey everyone,\n\nI just wanted some feedback regarding my potential departure from my current employer to pursue my own venture in a tangential industry. When I first joined the company three years ago, my contract stipulated that I would receive a base salary and 5% of sales for two years before a review and 10% of profits for five years.\n\nIt's been nearly three years since I started, and there has been no word of any review of my contract, except for a minor raise about a year in. I would appreciate some help interpreting these bonuses, as a lot has happened since I joined the company. The business generates multiple streams of income, including retail sales and in-person trading income. Does the 5% of sales apply to all of the company's income during those two years, as listed on the profit and loss statement?\n\nAdditionally, while the company has yet to turn a profit, am I entitled to 10% of the gross profit from those sales? Or am I to receive nothing since the profit loss is in the black? The company doesn't appear to be in a position to pay out these bonuses anytime soon, and I recently informed my boss that I'm considering my own venture. I've done this because it's getting real with this new venture and I've spoken to them in the past on a different project, which seems to be working. In saying this, I've set myself up this time to leave if necessary, but I don't want to leave the bonus off the table. For example, 5% of sales would amount to $18k.\n\nI know this may sound clich\u00e9, but I truly believe that the company either needs me to move forward or needs to make a change by finding someone else. It's a bit polarizing.\n\nThank you for your time and any feedback you can provide.

Problem: People want to memorialize their pets with custom portraits, but they don't want to spend a lot of money.\n2. Solution: Offer affordable custom pet portraits that capture the unique personality and characteristics of each pet.\n3. Target market: Pet owners who want to immortalize their beloved pets in a beautiful and affordable way.\n4. Value proposition: Our custom pet portraits are affordable, high-quality, and personalized to capture the unique character of each pet.\n5. Key metrics: Number of orders, revenue per order, customer satisfaction rating.\n6. Channels: Social media (Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest), Etsy, pet stores, word of mouth.\n7. Customer segments: Pet owners who want a custom portrait of their pet, including dog and cat owners, as well as owners of more exotic pets.\n8. Revenue streams: Sales of custom pet portraits, additional sales of related products such as frames and canvas prints.\n9. Cost structure: Materials, marketing and advertising costs, website and platform fees.\n10. Key activities: creating custom pet portraits, marketing and advertising, customer service and support.\n11. Key partnerships: Pet stores, animal shelters, veterinary clinics, and other pet-related businesses that can refer customers to the business.\n12. Key resources: Talented artists who can create beautiful and accurate pet portraits, a reliable platform for selling and advertising the product, customer support and service team.\n13. Unfair advantage: A focus on affordable and high-quality portraits that capture the unique personality and characteristics of each pet sets us apart from competitors who offer generic or expensive portraits.\n\nOverall, a LEAN business plan for a custom pet portrait business should focus on the key elements of the business, including the problem and solution, target market, value proposition, key metrics, channels, customer segments, revenue streams, cost structure, key activities, key partnerships, key resources, and unfair advantage. By using a LEAN approach, the business can stay focused and agile, making adjustments as needed to improve the product and grow the business over time.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678164656.0},{"title":"Looking for guidance","author":"trol1l","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11kpf20\/looking_for_guidance\/","text":"Im looking for a way to make easy money online!

The business has 100% ownership and is up for sale at a very reasonable price of $30k.\n\nUnfortunately, the main reason behind this decision is a lack of running capital, which has caused us to struggle to scale the business. However, I strongly believe that the business has the potential to generate between 4-5k dollars per month and is easily scalable, given the right resources and management.\n\nNow, you might be wondering, why should you invest in this business in Dubai? The answer is simple - Dubai is one of the fastest-growing business hubs in the world, with a thriving economy and a strategic location that offers easy access to emerging markets. By buying this business, you'll be gaining exposure to a dynamic and diverse customer base that spans across the UAE and beyond.\n\nMoreover, the business model itself is a unique combination of ecommerce and offline models, which is a relatively untapped market in the region. This means that there's plenty of room for innovation and growth, and you'll be well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.\n\nAs the founder of the business, I am also willing to offer my services to the new owner, should they require it. I am confident that I can continue to generate and develop the business, and ensure that it reaches its full potential under your leadership.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a promising investment opportunity that offers great exposure and scalability, my Dubai-based startup might be just what you're looking for.

I am in initial stages. I have purchased [www.modernmindsconsulting.com](https:\/\/www.modernmindsconsulting.com) and have hired someone to design the webpage for me. It should be ready to share in a day or two. I am going to lay out what I have so far, in the hopes that I can get some valuable feedback and advice. \n\n**Niche**: I am targeting small online businesses, such as new ecommerce companies and freelancers. I'll offer the standard amenities, such as strategic planning, process improvement, organizational development, and website feedback. Additionally, and this will be my expertise, I will offer help with Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning (DL), viral marketing, and data analytics.   \n\n**Tagline:**  \"Modern Minds Innovating Today for a Future-Proof Tomorrow\" \n\n**Description:** Modern Minds Consulting is a dynamic consulting firm that specializes in providing innovative solutions for modern business challenges. Our firm's aras of exertise include AI, ML, NLP, DL, virtal marketing, content marketing, and data analytics. \n\n**Marketing efforts:** \n\n* I am thinking that I should send an email to all of my small business\/freelancing LinkedIn contacts and offer my services for free. The exchange can be them allowing me to feature their business on my website as a company I've successfully helped. I also thought it would be a good idea to offer this service free on several Reddit pages, such as r\/smallbusiness and r\/freelance. Is this a good idea? \n* Create social media pages on Twitter and Facebook and connect with small business groups and freelancing groups. Offer free services there as well. \n* I will go over those with a slideshow I create implementing the information I gleaned through research, interviews, surveys, and more during the consulting period. I'll also furnish to them a detailed list and step-by-step instructions. \n* My idea to profit from the free services would be with affiliate sales and upselling. I'll offer them coupon codes which will work as affiliate links if they purchase any of the tools I offer. They can choose to use my links or not. I'll be up front about that. I will offer to implement everything for them as a bundled price. This means I'll implement all the tools and train their in-house staff, the same as I would in a paid gig. They can choose to do that or not, but either way they will still have all of my valuable consulting experience and advice to implement on their own, and I'll have a logo I can add to my list of companies I've successfully worked with. \n* Once I have built up my reputation a bit, I'll send out an email campaign asking for referrals. \n* I also thought to attend some conventions or business events for networking. I do very well in face-to-face sales.  That's all I have right now. \n\nMy paid services will include me handling everything on the list, but the list should be digestible enough that the companies I help for free can easily implement it. My free service would be to survey and interview their department heads and employees. Provide all consulting features, and then provide them with DIY strategies. In my full-service paid consulting gigs, I will provide training to departments and handle changes myself, such as implementing features, updating tools, updating metadata and things of that nature. \n\n**What I will charge:** I have determined that I should offer packages and ala carte services rather than pay-per-hour. I think my pricing should include a standard, premium, and deluxe package. Because I am working with small businesses and freelancers, I thought to price these packages at $299, $499, and $699. \n\nI am having trouble determining exactly what should go into these packages to set them apart and justify their pricing.  \n\nConsulting includes: Initial consultation to discuss needs and goals. Assessment, which will include surveys, meetings, and townhalls. Analysis of data and identify key issues and opportunities for improvement. Presentation of findings. Implementation of recommendations. And, evaluation of the effectiveness of recommendations and providing ongoing support. \n\nThat's what I have got. I appreciate any help here!

We can use Jira, Asana or some other product for this (other recommendations are welcome as well!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a university edu google drive account, which is advertised as unlimited (yeah, I know it's actullay limited). So if the \"large file storage\" isn't available than I want to use my google drive account as storage and when I drag-and drop an audio file I want it to be stored on my google drive instead of the software's cloud that will have a smaller storage.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678099548.0},{"title":"Taking business plan to next phase","author":"olivepitzz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Entrepreneur\/comments\/11k0eqg\/taking_business_plan_to_next_phase\/","text":"I have what I think is a really good idea for a platform to offer a service.
