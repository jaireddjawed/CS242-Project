I use free credit monitoring. I have unique passwords and two-factor authentication on all my financial accounts. The only personally identifying piece of info in my wallet was my driver's license. I never would have thought that this could happen to me.\n\nWhat I learned, first as a victim and then as a reporter writing about it, was that identity theft happens to millions of people every year and very little is being done to prevent it from happening. Every victim, like me, is on the hook to clean up after the thieves that stole our identities and the institutions that let them do it.\n\nI wrote a¬†[front-page story about what happened](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2022-10-26/identity-theft-nightmare)¬†when my financial identity was taken from me and how I fought back.

        "text": "Hello, I‚Äôm NPR investigative reporter Chiara Eisner. I‚Äôve been covering execution workers for more than a year, to find out what it‚Äôs like to do these kinds of jobs. I tracked down 26 people who worked on executions across 17 states and the federal death chamber. They were executioners, lawyers, correctional officers, prison spokespeople, wardens, corrections leaders, a researcher, a doctor, an engineer, a journalist and a nurse. It‚Äôs hard to report on this ‚Äì many of the people I talked to shared their names and stories publicly with me for the first time. Some had never even told their families about their roles before.\n\nA few said they volunteered for the jobs they did and that it didn't bother them much. But many more said the work was often a required part of their jobs, and it took a toll. Most of the people I interviewed told me they suffered serious mental and physical repercussions ‚Äì and just one person said they received any kind of psychological support from the government to help them cope.\n\nThe workers told me the experience was enough to change many of their views on capital punishment. Out of all the people whose work required them to witness executions in Virginia, Nevada, Florida, California, Ohio, South Carolina, Arizona, Nebraska, Texas, Alabama, Oregon, South Dakota and Indiana, none told me they still support the death penalty today ‚Äì even those who started off their jobs in favor of capital punishment.\n\nHere‚Äôs the [story](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/16/1136796857/death-penalty-executions-prison) NPR published about it in November which aired on All Things Considered (check out the photos there of some of the execution workers I spoke with). [Here‚Äôs](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1137380268) a slightly different audio version of the story that aired the next day, and here‚Äôs the [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ChiaraEisner/status/1592989561332039681?s=20&amp;t=LBFTJ7LNztbpT2tep90ICA) I wrote up about some of the reporting. [Here‚Äôs a photo](https://imgur.com/a/JbrqOhA)I took while reporting in Nevada ‚Äì it‚Äôs of the gas chamber where Catarino Escobar, a former corrections officer who volunteered to pretend to be executed so other staff could rehearse the protocol, became convinced he was about to die. And [here‚Äôs a shameless selfie](https://imgur.com/a/9lDxfsZ) from back at the NPR studio.\n\nSo ask me anything ‚Äì about the execution workers, what it was like to find them and report on this, the death penalty in America today or whatever else comes to mind! We'll be starting at 1 PM ET!",

        "text": "Hi Reddit, We are Sadeka, Hannah and Sandhya.\n\nOur research is on developing technologies to detect cancer at its early stages. Early detection significantly increases survival rate in cancer patients. For example, for ovarian cancer patients, the 5-year survival rate is below 30% when diagnosed at stage 3 or higher (stages are levels of cancer advancements). If detected early at stage 1, this survival rate increases to &amp;gt;90%. However, early detection of ovarian cancer is challenging due to lack of unique symptoms, especially since we do not yet have a screening device.\n\nOur research vision is to design a screening device for the early detection of ovarian cancer. We are developing microfluidics-\nbased devices for screening. These tiny devices have a little inlet port into which we will be able to load patient blood samples. These samples will travel through the device and if there are any cancer cell secreted molecules or vesicles, these will be detected within the device. When captured, the device gives a signal and the patient will be advised to take more sensitive tests for further investigation. \n\nPlease ask us anything about using engineering approaches for detecting cancer.\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://www.flickr.com/photos/uniofbath/52532179298/in/dateposted/)!",

Each reskinned game will be fully playable and reimagined with the artist‚Äôs vision - redesigning all graphics and backgrounds.¬†Every rendition of each game will be released as limited editions of Digital Cartridges, available for purchase on the blockchain.¬†\n\nOur first limited title release is with contemporary artist Shantell Martin who was tasked with reskinning the classic Atari game Asteroids¬Æ. The Digital Cartridge will include three editions (Artist, Gold, and Silver), with the minting date set for December 12 and the Digital Cartridges will be stored on the [Ethereum Blockchain](https://ethereum.org/en/).

        "text": "Hey Reddit, I‚Äôm L, James Giocomo, a writer of sorts. I started my career in 2015, and there's one particular project I've been working on since I got my start, Yonggary. Yonggary is an upcoming American kaiju epic and a reimagining of the character [Yonggary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonggary_(character)), introduced in the 1967 South Korean masterpiece [Yongari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongary,_Monster_from_the_Deep). Although [it was already remade in 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonggary_(1999_film)), that was a Korean remake of their own film. This, meanwhile, is going to be a major Hollywood production. And while the film has yet to commence production, things have still been quite busy. Last year, I tapped [Rockford, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockford,_Illinois)\\-based artist [Sasha Spataro](https://gladiknow.com/index-people/Sasha-Spataro/Rockford-IL) to design the eponymous reptilian being. You can check out our designs for both the infant and adult forms [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreatureDesign/comments/zbr11n/yonggary_adult_infant/).  As with other AMAs, I‚Äôll answer the questions that get the most upvotes from the community. Once they‚Äôre selected, I will answer as many of them as I can. \n\nPROOF:  [https://www.mycast.io/stories/yonggary](https://www.mycast.io/stories/yonggary)",
