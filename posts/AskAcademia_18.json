I worked on biochemical and wearable sensors, public health, statistics, machine learning, behavioural change, digital health... basically I have a broad knowledge of many things, rather than the deep knowledge of a niche that is normally expected from a PhD graduate. I have 6 first-author papers (4 in journals), but I am really struggling to find a postdoc because I don't have deep expertise in anything. I've had a few interviews, but they've all chosen candidates with more experience and deep technical expertise. Also, I need to mention that my supervisor won't help me find something or connect me to other PIs. Given all this information, does anybody have any suggestions on what I could do to land a postdoc?",

My current position is an analyst position so I am no longer doing pure research. I take things that have been completed and apply them to new problems to try and identify potential solutions. My project timelines can be very short and my priorities can rapidly change. I was moreso hired for my ability to present technical research to non-technical audiences and I enjoy making presentations. I enjoy scoping out my projects but I have trouble completing them, I get bogged down in the shifting priorities.\n\nI am not friends with my coworkers. They are mostly loners that tackle things by themselves and regroup for the 30 minute meeting once every two weeks. Communication can be poor so work can often be repeated by multiple people and it is unclear what the priorities are. They also come in on weekends and over breaks to get extra time in. My work demands seem so unclear and overwhelming and I feel like I am letting everyone down. I am not performing up to my potential.\n\nI no longer enjoy learning and doing physics research or programming. I don't want to deal with these shifting deadlines, unclear priorities, or posturing. I think about work on the weekend and how I haven't done enough of the right things or if a project deadline will come up unexpectedly. My partner has commented that I always look stressed and angry when I get home.\n\n Have any of you dealt with these issues at your first job post PhD? What sorts of career changes should I be thinking about? I have been really bummed, doubting myself, and am worried my career is over.",

Immersing myself into research and writing reports, attending conferences, exchanging opinions it's... all I ever wanted. Finishing my studies and pursuing a PhD is a given, even though I know the chances of surviving through an academic payroll are extremely low, especially here in Greece. Unfortunately, to make due I had to work two jobs (completely unrelated to my field of studies), hence I didn't prepare well enough for my finals. Not wanting to risk my overall marks and another chance to get a scholarship, I chose to withdraw from the current exam season and join the next one, pushing back my thesis by 6 months. And this is where all the problems began.\n\n By taking the \"safe\" route, I have developed tremendous anxiety. I know other people could finish their degree successfully, in time, while working 2+ jobs, having children etc. I thought by making this decision my cortisol levels would be lower, but the exact opposite is happening. Ever since, I have developed an eating disorder, my hairs are turning to grey and falling out. My average resting bpm have increased, I can't stand up for prolonged periods of time and I feel completely exhausted in the middle of the day, which leads me to take frequent naps. \n\nAm I just not cut out for Academia? Although my marks are top of the class and I have received two scholarships so far, it seems like the field I love the most is destroying me, inside out. I have no one to relate to in my family, since we don't have an academic background and everyone thinks -including the doctors- that it's just anxiety and I should get over it. \n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThank you dearly for your time.",

I mean, I can work, sure, but will it be enough to pay. Or are there any other options?\n\n2. I can apply a program in my hometown, in my city. I am living with my family. However I feel like I have to earn my own money and live my life more like an individual, but it's not gonna happen if I attend a program in here. \n\n3. I can attend a program in a different city in my home country that is more prestigious than the program/university in my city. However life expenses are high, and the I'll have the same struggle with the first option in here. Will the money be enough.\n\nI am open to all your suggestions. And would be thankful for any of your insight.\n\nP.s. My gpa and other requirement are enough for all the program I am planning to attend. The problem is kinda like either struggling to find money or struggling to feel like an individual.",

It took me four years to finish. 2020 I started again and am currently enrolled in an Art History in Global Context program at the same university. I have minored in Philosophy and Film studies in my BA and Film studies also now in my MA. I am planning on graduating this fall. \n\nDuring the whole time, I have been working as an editor for the national broadcast company and focussing more on online in recent years. I also worked 100% during the 'gap' year between my bachelor's and my master's. Last year, I started taking on the additional responsibility of a commissioning officer, funding and co-producing multimedia projects. I talk to universities, supporting their art programs, and get to comment on submissions on a national level. But it isn't easy to hold, as this position only officially existed before restructuring. So my current department lends me some additional time, and I get to do my things.(But I still have a lot of say concerning these specific projects. The fund still exists and requires an expert, but I don't have a boss.). \n\nCurrently, I am at a fork in the road. I am turning 29 this year. (I wasted some time thinking I would become an engineer). While taking on more responsibility, my pay and job description at work have not changed in the last seven years. (This was also my first official job starting with 21) I feel stuck and stuck in corporate, where I don't get challenged, and sometimes I think at least 30% of my work could be automated. I have applied for various positions at the company. It's either you are overqualified (which is a nice way of saying that I am underqualified) or that I am still too young. \n\nI finished most of my classes on only have my master's thesis to work on, which stretches over two semesters. I have been considering going for a semester abroad. That would imply I would have to quit my job. Is there a place for someone like me in the private art sector, museums, and cultural institutions? Is a semester, which is only four months plus change, worth it? Should I go all in and pivot to art history also professionally or stick to media? I feel like I have a lot of soft skills that I can't communicate or demonstrate on the spot. I grew up bilingual on two continents and speak four languages plus some dialects. So it's not that I have never experienced other cultures. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you managed up to here, thank you for your time. I appreciate it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\npanda",

Coinflip odds seems to good to be true given everything I've heard about the academia job market.\n\n(I understand placement stats don't factor in people who exited the program, but the placement pages are listing cohort sizes of 19-23, which I believe is generally close or slightly below the number of PhD candidates that start out. I also understand getting into a T3/10 program is difficult and unpredictable. I'm just curious whether the pladement rate actually is 50% or slightly below).",

He doesn’t use linkedin and may have retired. I don’t think any other lecturer would remember me after 3 years, and would not give a representative reference. Similarly, with my BSc I finished it in 2018, and the cohorts are so big I think even my supervisor would barely remember me. Also, I know would be hesitant to write someone a reference after 4 years. \n\nI have worked in a contract research organisation, where my line manager can say how I work in industry research, but she doesn’t have a PhD herself, just years of experience. I currently work at a university, and have just moved from a lab role supporting students to a research technician role in the same institution. However, they still are considered professional references as they don’t know my academic work. \n\nI feel I have no other choice but to use these but I still feel I’m shooting myself in the foot for something out of my control.

This past semester I've asked 2 people who I've worked with in their labs to write me a letter of rec. We are pretty close. They agreed, fast forward to the end of December till now. I've been emailing the professors and I sent out the requests for all the programs that allowed it. I'm working on all the applications but so far I haven't gotten any response to my emails. I understand it's the holidays but the biggest problem is that over break professors typically go inactive. Meaning they don't check their emails during break. \n\nThat's a major issue because most of the programs I'm applying to are due before the semester starts. And the letter of rec has to be submitted before the due date. I have no clue when or if they're reading their emails. And all the requests have been emails. I'm extremely afraid of them checking their email one day and seeing like 6 requests due within days of each other. And then they can't write me a letter of rec they don't have enough time. Some of the other programs I have to upload the letter of rec so I need an attachment as well. I'm not sure what to do because I've been updating them and been sending them info but with no response. It is the holidays so I do understand but I'm not sure how to go about this. \n\nI'm not sure if I should email the programs because I literally have no one else who can write me a letter of rec.

I was a BAD STUDENT, I didn't do readings, I wrote all my projects the night before (including the 60 page $40,000 reports I still do!!!), I party, I take many romantic (not sexual) partners, I do psychedelics... The faculty members don't seem to do these things. It feels as though I am leading a double life. I kind of just want to quit everything and do nothing but write music, but then I'll starve. What do.

I found out that a Master's degree can get really broad and you can only get an enfasis using your electives rather than being 100% focused on a specific topic like certificates. Machine Learning and AI are super facinatign technologies and there are some schools ofering certificates that look very attractive to me. Specifically [MIT](https://professional.mit.edu/certificate-programs), [eCornell](https://ecornell.cornell.edu/certificates/technology/), [Harvard](https://extension.harvard.edu/academics/?live_global%5BrefinementList%5D%5Blevels%5D%5B0%5D=Graduate%20Certificate) are some of the ones that looks very good. I know that to get a Master's the application process to any of those schools and prices get astronomically high so I looked at programs like [ASU's Master's CS Degree](https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/graduate/computer-science-mcs/) and others. The question is, specially for developers and professionals out there. What would be better ? IF you have done both or either, how much does it help you professionally to get either one of the previous options. Should I get a certificate from a top School like MIT to Harvard or a MS Degree from another school like ASU, etc. Which option would help me advance my carrier further ? Considering costs and the time it takes to complete either, what is the better option ? Do those certificates look good on a resume or people would value more a MS Degree?  \n\n\nAny helpful insight on this is highly appreciated.",

Happy new year!\n\nSecond year Phd student here, Physics, Quantum Info. \n\nRecently it came to my attention that not all Journals (namely Nature, I hate Nature) do not publish the reviewer's take on an article but rather keep all correspondence strictly confidential. Other journals do (eg. SciPost). \n\nThis question of mine came to be since a recent article was published in Nature claiming bombastic and revolutionary results. The article then got picked up by the media and they extricated every single drop of milk out of the article. At first glance, sure, the results were amazing. \n\nBut then a reviewer's take on the article got filtered in Twitter in which the reviewer heavily criticized the article's language and how the authors presented the results. The results were solid but the authors made claims of things they didn't actually achieved (namely, the authors claimed \"they made a &lt;thing&gt; in the lab\". Great! but actually there was no &lt;thing&gt;, never was, but the results could be physically interpreted as if there was a &lt;thing&gt;. Quite a difference). \n\nBut by then, the article had gotten all the attention possible and the damage was done. \n\nLong story short, what do you think: should reviewer's notes and comments be made publicly available, albeit keeping the reviewer's identity secret?",

        "text": "Looking for advice, or perhaps just anecdotes for how people in similar situations have dealt with this.\n\nI'm in the third year of my PhD program. It's a 3-4 year philosophy degree. I'm funded by a research institute that funds me for three years, so if I go into continuation and take the extra (4th) year I won't get paid (I also write freelance so if this happens finance shouldn't be *too* much of an issue).\n\nMy thesis should be 80-90,000 words, and I've done about 40,000. I've done four chapters out of eight. I expected to be well ahead of where I am, but I didn't anticipate that I would spend almost a whole year attempting to understand one philosopher, reading his various books, secondary texts, taking courses on him, and so on. Taking so long to understand him properly was very humbling. My thesis isn't on this philosopher, but he's central to my thesis's main argument, and it was necessary to know him very intricately (and he's notoriously difficult).\n\nBecause of this unanticipated 'setback', I'm in the spot I'm in. I'm also doing my freelance work to top up my meagre scholarship (my current life situation renders this necessary, money-wise).\n\nI've also had some family issues (health-related) which had me caring for someone for quite a while (that responsibility ended a couple of months ago), and other such normal life things. I'm at the point now where I feel so overwhelmed that I've almost stopped working. Sometimes I find it difficult to get out of bed - it seems like life has so much going on that it's not even worth trying. Silly, I know, and I do overcome this feeling a lot of the time by telling myself the only solution is to make progress to alleviate it, but it's my default state.\n\nThe problem is exacerbated because I've been given the opportunity to potentially land a great post-doc project, *providing* I complete the PhD this year and don't go into continuation. This will mean I have to do half the PhD in, say, 8 months (+2 for editing and submission etc.). I've got all the theoretical foundation laid, now, so I'm hoping the second half of my thesis will be much easier, but it still feels insurmountable to do it all in a few months given my other work and life commitments. I could go into continuation, struggle with money for the extra year, and pass up the postdoc opportunity, but that's not ideal even just considering I won't receive scholarship/studentship funding for that final year and I'll be a month shy of 30 when I finish when I already feel like I'm delaying my life's potential 'progress' at the moment compared to where I want to be with my partner and family and so on.\n\nI think my brain's struggling to deal with the scale of this and is shutting down a bit - like I said, sometimes I'm struggling to even get out of bed and do chores that need doing because of the knowledge of what I have in front of me, let alone do the actual work. I should have completed another chapter to send to my supervisor a month ago and I'm not close yet.\n\nWas anyone in a similar situation with their PhD? What would you advise I do at this point with such little (potential) time left?",

        "text": "After a year and a bit (already with one 3-month extension), I submitted my research masters thesis a week or so ago (30,000 words, subject English Literature). I got it in 1 minute before the deadline with multiple citations missing, chunks that were disordered and hadn't been properly integrated and a whole chapter absent. Technically, it was submitted but given what was actually in the document, it will certainly have failed. I think there may even have been a sentence or two where I inadvertently (and I really do mean inadvertently) plagiarised (not in the sense of nicking other people's ideas, rather not using quote marks for a sentence while still citing it - this was a product of my poor and rushed note taking and not intentional, but I'm aware the markers are still likely to take a dim view of it). \n\nObviously, I'm very disappointed about this and, frankly, ashamed to have failed to submit something even close to passing in the time I've been given and I'm wondering about next steps. If, as will surely be the case, the thesis fails, is this the end of the line for me? Are there normally options for students to go away, fill in the gaps so to speak, and resubmit, or is it more of a one-and-done? (My university has been quite poor on communicating about this sort of stuff, although, of course, nowhere near as poor as have been my research efforts.) \n\nIf the opportunity presents itself, a part of me would like to try and finish off this thesis and get a qualification. In part because I have spent a lot of money to get the chance to obtain it, and in another part because my studies have been beset and undermined by quite serious illness. I have recently been diagnosed with a functional neurological disorder but there is genuine ambiguity that this may actually be young-onset ALS (since many of my symptoms do not fit FND and are more of a piece with that disease - indeed, I personally have become quite convinced that it is ALS, which is obviously a challenge all of itself). I have been struggling with ill physical and frankly terrible mental health for several years now and despite pushing hard for clinical help have found this difficult to obtain. My tutors are aware of this which was why I was granted a 3-month extension in the first place, however, obviously I have still failed to submit a passable thesis.\n\nI have very copious notes and scattershot paragraphs for the remaining chapter - and indeed an additional chapter that would probably be a good addition but I ran out of time to complete and submit. I have been told by my tutor (who I unfortunately fell out of contact with as I kept missing deadlines) that I have enough knowledge to gain the qualification and that my ideas are all good etc. but I have struggled to write them down on paper. This has obviously been massively exacerbated by my health issues. \n\nAny information and or advice you can give me would be much appreciated. Although a part of me has come to peace with the reality that this whole project has been a disaster and that I will not be receiving this qualification, another part of me would like to try and find a way through this to get at least something out of the year of study. Finally, please be gentle: I don't need reminding that I've fucked this up badly, or that I'm an awful student - I am well aware of both these things. Thank you.",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am wondering how others feel about their past publications. I recently had an interesting conversation about this with a senior scholar. When I said something along the lines of \"I think like many scholars I am rather critical of my previous publications\" he immediately declared that he is very fond and proud of his own work.\n\nWhile I might be an extreme case in terms of being critical about my work (I have written here about my anxiety about my work before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/yvhlb1/anxiety_and_letting_go_of_ones_old_work/)), I was still surprised by the reply of said senior scholar and am interested in what others think. It is not that I cannot step back and feel proud about my books and articles at certain times, but I always took publications as something that needs to be done but that I am not necessarily ever fully happy with. I do get some closure after a publication is out, but I remain afraid of possible imperfections or errors and, for instance, have to stop myself from looking at previous publications and checking for possible mistakes. Therefore, any publication is somewhat ambiguous for me: I am happy it is out but afraid of possible mistakes and criticisms by others.\n\nSo, I am wondering whether my attitude is the outlier here or that senior scholar's.",

But then, what can we do? Besides formal education, and also the ocassional class for that (which often, being one semester long, I woudn't think highly of it), there are some books that have good advice and I think are worth looking into:\n\n\\-  Thomas J. Tobin: \"Reach Everyone, Teach Everyone\" and \"Evaluating Online Teaching\"\n\n\\- Ken Bain: What the Best College Teachers Do\n\n\\- James Lang: Small Teaching\n\nBesides the books, there's the obvious (although unfortunately not always implemented) anonymous feedback from students about asking what things could be improved in class.\n\nAlso, Paul N. Edwards has a brief guide on [How to Give an Academic Talk](http://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/howtotalk.pdf), which I find to be excellent, and the advice applies also to giving lectures.\n\nWhat other things can you routinely do to improve your classes?",

I was recently accepted by the university and they offered me a departmental fellowship for my first semester with subsequent semesters being funded by the advisor's grant money (which includes a stipend and full tuition). Also, my employer put me on a scholarship that covers my tuition and a very low stipend for the duration of the PhD even though they are also paying the advisor grant money for the project. I am currently in my first year in the PhD program working under the advisor on the project. I realized that the stipend I receive from my employer's scholarship is barely enough to pay for the rent and all the other students working on the same project are being paid an RA departmental standard stipend which is double that of my scholarship stipend. I brought this up indirectly to my advisor in the hopes that he will offer me an RA that at least augment my scholarship stipend to a livable wage similar to my peers (which is the department's policy) however he would give me vague answers and then complains that my company still hasn't paid their grant installment for this year/or how other students are having a hard time finding affordable housing..etc. I just feel like I am being treated like a bargaining chip, even though I am a student and bringing outside money that pays my tuition in full and half the departmental standard stipend. Should I be upfront with my advisor and ask/email him to augment my stipend and hire me as an RA just like my peers who are working on the same project? What if he refuses? To whom should I talk? I don't want to take out loans to compensate for the low stipend since I live in a high cost of living area.\n\nI also checked the grant contract written by my company, it mentions no restriction in me receiving a stipend. I don't want to bring this up to my company management and make things sour between me and my advisor since we get along well and his advising style checks all my preferences.",

        "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nTLDR: I have my Ph.D in chemistry and have been working as a Sr. Scientist and now as a scientific project director for the federal/national lab system. I am looking to volunteer my free time at a local community college or small PUI. What would be the most appropriate way to do this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been working at a National Lab for a while now. Recently, I moved over from the contractor side to the federal side of things as a federal scientific project director. While I now get to be an integral part of making some absolutely massive multi agency scientific projects happen, my ability to do small scale niche research at work as become a lot more difficult due to the rules and regulations built around federal positions and how they can interact with their contractors. Rather than trying to deal with all the red tape I was hoping to connect with some of the local community colleges and PUIs in my area. I do miss getting to mentor undergrads, and I have a lot of solid projects that are more academic in scope and don't really fit the mission of the lab I am working at, I believe these would spark some serious interest and would be great for establishing some collaborative efforts. I would also be happy just helping out in the lab as well. What would be the most appropriate way to cold contact a university or professor to volunteer my free time and resources?",

My PI doesn't work in the area of this experiment at all, and it will likely be published in journals they don't publish in or have any experience with.\n\nShould I tell my PI I want to work with this other author (assuming they are open to working with me), should I offer the PI co-author?\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking this. I just don't want to upset my PI or break norms.",

        "text": "-First off all apologize for my grammar, English it's not my first language- \nFor context, I live in Brazil where we have public and private colleges, the private one its basically the same thing as in other countries but the public ones are different because not only it's completely free but all so great academically spiking. \nI go to a private college and I study International relations, my mom is paying for me, it's cost R$ 500/ per month ( I have scholarship so I got the price reduced).\nBut it's still very hard to maintain my lifestyle because iam currently unemployed, but iam looking for a job and I have been selected to some selection process in so companies.\nMy problem it's, my college doesn't provide much academic resources, lest semester I had a conversation with one of my professors and we agreed on make a scientific research about a really interesting topic, but she left the university and all so I received the news that my college will only provide 300 opportunities to scientific research. \nSo I found out that one of the best public university (USP) on my county does this transfer test, and the passing score its not that high. And by going to this university I can do my scientific research without worry about being chosen as one off 300 opportunity.\nThe thing is IF every thing works out fine I a got in this university, it will probably be on the morning time ( I go on the night period because this easy to get a job opportunity). So I wouldn't be able to work.\nI don't know what to do, I really want to start my academic career because my dream job is being a professor/researcher.\nWhat should I do ??",
