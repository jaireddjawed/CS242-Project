It was at a local coffee shop. I found him sitting in one of the booths at the coffee shop. He was on his phone. I was really scared. A part of me wanted to tackle him with a hug and beg for his forgiveness. Another part of me, wanted to leave before he noticed me. I said his name to get his attention. He didn't even leave his seat; he just looked at me and said hi. I asked if I could sit. I started asking about how is he doing. He said he was fine. I was about to apologize, but he interrupted me by saying, \"Before you apologize, I want to understand how the relationship between Max and you even started.\"\n\nI started telling him everything. When it came to mentioning my meet-ups, he interjected me and started asking me questions that were difficult to answer. He asked \"So all the times that you were going out you were lying to me about where were you going. Weren't you?\" I nodded. \"What about the times I asked to spend time with you? Did you lie to me so you meet up with Max instead?\" I started tearing up. It was hard being there. \"Did you miss out on events to be with Max? What about my birthday?\" That's when I started crying. He told me to save my tears. He said he figured that out soon after he learned about the relationship with Max. He just wanted to hear it from me. He then asked me if I was still with Max. I told him I was married to him and I have a daughter with him. He seemed to need a minute to process that.\n\nThen he started speaking. He told me he never had an issue with me dating or meeting someone. In fact, he hoped I found love. He understands that I needed companionship and a type of love he couldn't offer as my son. He told me throughout all these years he felt conflicted because both Max and I were both consenting adults and adults have a right to find happiness. My son admitted he shouldn't Max and was glad he didn't press charges. He said despite all of that, they were some things that he can't get over. He told me he can't get over the fact that I didn't take him into consideration when it came to pursuing the relationship. It was also hurtful to realize that I would value a romantic relationship to the point of being willing to throw away a close relationship with him for it. If I had the attitude of being done raising him and finally pursuing my own life, then that's valid, according to him. However, I would have no right to want to have a close relationship with him in return. Again, that's what he said he believes. He told me he wouldn't have forgotten me when he left for college. He would have wanted me to move close to him after he got a job if he couldn't move close to me. In this ideal world we would live close by so he we could still see each other even after he had a family.\n\nHe said he loves himself and his life too much to have back in my life.. My son said he works as a mechanical engineer now. He is engaged to the love of his life. She was also raised by a single mom like him until she was 16 when her stepdad into the picture. Both of them have welcomed him into the family. He told me his future in-laws and his fiance are his family now. He said he was getting a job near them.\n\nHe finally admitted that he just wanted closure before permanently cutting me off. He told me not to contact him or his family at all. He made it clear he wouldn't be there for me at my last stage of life or even come to my funeral. He made it clear he won't even hold my hand when I pass away. I won't have the privilege of knowing his fiance or his future kids. He made it clear that if his half-sister ever contacts him as an adult he'll be upfront on why he doesn't want a relationship with her. He said good bye to me and left. I cried so hard that I got the attention of the people in the coffee shop. I was crying on the way back home. I don't even know how therapy can even help. I never felt so much emotional pain in my life before. What do I do now?","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1678630366.0},{"title":"In a really bad mood.....

He's the one person that stuck with me throughout high school and even to this day, but there's a number of things about him that bother me and I need to help on how to deal with it.\n\nKeep in mind that's he's autistic so it makes things more complicated, although he's able to act like a normal person. We hangout and play video games together and we recently found out that we're actually cousins. He's also about the same age as me at 21 and since he doesn't wanna listen to me, I have to make this post instead.\n\nBut the issues are this: I'll start with his driving, he drives okay-ish but has issues that he refuses to correct and he doesn't want to listen to anyone for advice and that's one of his problems, he's really stubborn and refuses to take other peoples advice. He doesn't slow down for speed bumps, he takes off before I put my seatbelt on, and he nearly got into wrecks that if I weren't there, he would've had an accident. Yet he refuses to listen to anyone at all.\n\nSecondly on games, I always have problems hearing him speak through his mic, whether his volume is too low or if he's cutting out. I used to always ask him to fix it but he just refuses every time. He seems to think nothing is wrong at all and that it's always my side. He also gets immediately annoyed whenever I try to ask him to fix it, he doesn't want to listen to me about it, so it forces me to deal with it. With this in mind, he's extremely territorial about everything, if I try to move something, help him with stuff, or even try to talk to him about something, he gets into an aggressive attitude with his voice and warns me like an aggravated dog to leave it alone.\n\nSometimes he and his little brother can be really disrespectful and he's a little bit of a hypocrite. Any time he wants to show me something, I always put my attention to it and watch it or listen to it, but every time I want to show him something like a youtube video, he just has his attention on his phone and acts like he saw it, the only thing he listens to is when I play music in the car.\n\nLastly I think, he grew up with parents that didn't do much of a good job teaching manners or proper respect as a kid, so I'm always having to deal with him and his little brother talking back, being a smartass, and them just refusing to listen to advice or how to learn to do something better.\n\nHe's not a bad person and doesn't treat people poorly, but when you combine autism, stubbornness, and improper learning, you get a mixed bag of issues.\n\nSo please, how the hell do I deal with him when he doesn't even want to listen to me, his own best friend about his issues? I'm the type of person that has trouble with confrontation and I can't help but keep anger to myself, it's as if I've been conditioned to hold in my emotions. So it makes it hard for me to deal with him, and the only time he listens is when multiple people agree with each other and team up against him to make him listen and understand something. Now those people are gone and I'm left by myself in which, he doesn't listen to me. Sometimes he seems to act like he's in control. \n\nI just don't know how to deal with it anymore, how do I fix my friendship? If all else fails, it feels like the only thing that will solve the problem is to let myself get angry and yell at him and start an argument, drama, and worse of all, a fight, which I don't want to resort to any negativity.\n\nI'm making this post again to see if this community will actually respond, I posted this in another but it was just completely ignored and swept under the rug.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678679554.0},{"title":"Ive lied to my online friend about my name.","author":"goshawtyitsyourbday","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11px9yl\/ive_lied_to_my_online_friend_about_my_name\/","text":"Just like what the title says.

It wasn't always my sister, I (19F) had some issues previously with my mother (46F) doing the same thing when I had lived with them before. Well I'm living with them again and I had set boundaries when it comes to my room such as getting a doorknob that could be locked with a key because that was the main issue; them coming into my room and using my things when I'm not home. I don't mind sharing generally but I do mind that they use my things without even asking and leaving it a complete and utter mess when they're done. Everything was fine for a while after getting the lock but recently I've noticed things being out of place, my floor being so dirty when I swept it before I left to go to my s\/o's, as well as this gut feeling they were still getting in. I had even brought it up to my mom and now that I think about it, it wasn't a really good idea because it then lets her know what I'm thinking and the fact that I'm catching on. My suspicions were confirmed when I had found smudges of whatever grime my sister had on her hands was smeared on the doorknob on the inside as well as a charm I keep on the outside, sitting on my bed. A couple days after that I had went to the store with my mom while my sister was at home, I closed and locked my door like I always do. We then get back from the store and the door is open, still locked, mind you, but open. In the 7 months I've had that doorknob installed it has not once done that until recently so now I definitely know she's been going into my room. Words can't describe how upset I am, I am absolutely disgusted. It's just so mind boggling to me that not only would I have to go as far as to get a lock for my room because she wouldn't stay out but also that she has broken it. Earlier today I had purchased one of those hatches that goes over the door that requires a padlock to see if that helps; I'm just not really sure what to do anymore. I've tried to reason with, call out, express how that makes me feel, and just straight up tell her not to but to no avail; she just lies through her teeth each and every time. I've also tried to chalk it up to it being her age because she is 12 which does make a lot of sense but even when she was younger she has never had any real consideration for anything that wasn't hers and has an extreme lack of guilt or remorse for the things that she does and says. It's been really hard to talk about this with anyone in my family considering the age gap between my siblings and I and just the overall distrust I feel towards my entire family. I'm hoping when she gets older she'll eventually grow out of it but hoping doesn't really do anything in this case considering a child needs to be shown how to be a good person through good role models and becoming aware of how your actions affect others and also making that conscious decision to better themselves (that's what I had to do idk). But she doesn't have a lot of good role models, her dad is in and out of rehab centers and jail and our mom is a classic narcissist with a victim mentality (sorry mom it's true), and I'm so sick and tired of having to play the mom role; I am 19 and I hadn't even graduated a year ago, I am my siblings' older sister not the parent. My sister is going to go for a psych evaluation soon as well as getting into therapy and I'm honestly really happy that's happening, maybe then someone can help her with all that she's got going on. And don't get me wrong, I love my family but this type of behavior really drives a deep wedge into how I feel and see them; I don't want to involve people who treat me and what I say with so little consideration into my life further. I've become more secluded because I'm so over the constant negative energy and drama that always seems to come out of their mouths and just the passive aggressive or just straight up aggressive things they say and do towards me.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestion, let alone reads this, please PLEASE don't be afraid to say something.\n\nthank you","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678682370.0},{"title":"My life is a series of failures, and I am unsure if my future.","author":"Popculturefan99","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11q074i\/my_life_is_a_series_of_failures_and_i_am_unsure\/","text":"TL : DR\n\nWhy is it that I can\u2019t maintain any good relationships. Just why. Like I am 23, male, Autistic, bisexual and all alone. Like I would BEG right now for a friend. Someone to take me to coffee. Someone to take me out to drink. Someone who understands. Anyone. \n\nSo I have been mistrated by all regards. As a kid because of my Autism I went through ABA therapy at elementary school, where teachers would take away special interests (I loved movies) and was told to stop talking about movies and \u201conly getting movie talk as a reward\u201d and couldn\u2019t draw about them, or other interests like video games, Pok\u00e9mon, and dinosaurs. I was always a sensitive kid too who was prone to meltwodns, and the staff would violently touch me, restrain me or segregate me to other rooms. Students would bully me for my Autistic interests, and would often scream or bark at me when I wanted to be nice to them, and teachers were not only okay with it, but encouraged it.\n\nAnd staff always had their eyes on me and would yell at me over getting something wrong on schoolwork, or being my autistic awkward self or anything. My parents were no different either, my mom was someone who trauma dumped on me all the time about my dad, her aunt Irma, her mom and work, and child me couldn\u2019t comprehend it. So in high school I wanted friends so bad. I wanted to get drunk or high to escape my situation at home or school. But when you\u2019re autistic you don\u2019t get invited because you aren\u2019t \u201cmature\u201d enough to be invited, which is infantilization, treating us like we\u2019re much younger due to our Autism. Like growing up I felt like most of my peers treated me like a 5 year old child. \n\nCollege I thought would be the time I would get the close friends I always wanted to have as a child and teenager. But NOPE, instead covid comes and I get an existential crisis. The fact with so many rules with covid brought back a lot of untreated PTSD from childhood where there were so SO many rules that I would be in trouble for that I didn\u2019t know I broke or people getting mad over me not understanding social cues (more on that later). My mom didn\u2019t allow me to leave the house at AGE 21 bc I wanted to be socisl and meet people because I wanted CONNECTION. then in the 2020-21 school year was when my life went completely down the gutter. Residence rules for the college I went to were more strict which sucked bc again, I wanted to meet people as I was deprived of a friendship my whole life, as my parents were overprotective.\n\nMy mom even saw me being alone as a \u201cgift\u201d (my asshole) since being alone more to her would \u201dhelp creativity\u201d when the school environment literally STIFLED my creativity AND mental health. I can never finish the projects I do, have severe writers block and haven\u2019t written or made anything since 2020. Pandemic was a high energy draining situatuon especially for Autism. Often being around good people and close connections HELPS and BOOSTS creativity and when alone I get more destructive and less motivated. The year and rules only got worse, and my mom and I would bicker over EVERY little decision I made during the pandemic.\n\nThat same year I made a friend group only to lose it because I never understood a social cue. Another moved away. The next year was worse. Someone excluded me from an event which triggered a high and grade school flashback when people deliberately didnt invite me due to my Autism. And it was bc of not many guys going in an Uber and just girls, I was sad I was excluded from the \u201cgirls night\u201d bc to them I wasn\u2019t \u201cgay enough\u201d for the girls and not \u201cmanly enough\u201d for the guys. Oh I forgot to mention I\u2019ve had a series of falling outs with many people. First it was a friend who I grew up with a girl well call Isabel, who I thought was my friend but she was infantilizing me, she never let me smoke weed with her or go to parties w her due to her not seeing me as \u201cmature enough\u201d, as well as talking to me like a 5 year old, and saying \u201cautistics shouldn\u2019t have equal rights\u201d and put all types of autism in the same box. So I called her out on social media.\n\nIt only gets worse from here. First my grandma and I\u2019s relationship was detoriating, and she was surprisingly starting to become more ableist, which wasn\u2019t like her. At first she was telling me to give up talking to my old counsellor. She told me to give up convincing my parents to drop their rules (I used to be close to her) and to also stop behaviour and stims I can\u2019t help. Like meltdowns I try to tell her those I CANT help like screaming or yelling when they overwhelm me I tell her i can\u2019t help it, she thinks I can but I can\u2019t, but she just argued I can instead of convincing her it gives me sensory overload! Autistics HATE yelling, and I thought her old ass knew that for years. But then the big kicker was first when her son (my uncle) over the years would be ableist towards me and screamed at me for not lifting something I physically COULDN\u2019T lift due to low muscle tone, on top of homophobia and judging me for autistic interests. \n\nMy nana though did something horrible by when I was at her get together being mad at me for not eating much food (was eating dinner at home) and \u201cnot making eye contact with anyone\u201d like first off I can\u2019t help it and instead of understanding why I can\u2019t help it, she instead decided to be a bitch and ARGUE BACK, and then we had an argument over something again that I couldn\u2019t help, even saying I was \u201ctoo old for sensory overload\u201d \u2014 and I was rightfully pissed off. And since then I\u2019ve cut contact with her. I realized that her opinions came from the fact her husband who was bipolar schizophrenic was very likely actually autistic and adhd, since he had special interests of his own with religion and sports, and he didn\u2019t make eye contact, and often lived in his own world and kind of was like the Chris Chan of my hometown in the 70s where he thought fictional things were real. And my nana believed schizphrenia with him, and back then Autism was often mislabeled as schizophrenia, and adhd was mislabeled as bipolar. My nana hates anyone who shows even an ounce of mental illness, but when you call her or anyone in my extended family out on their bullshit, they throw a hissy fit, make themselves out to be victim and call you abusive.\n\nI also had friends, two with adhd who I was briefly close with. One well call Patty for protection. I feel like looking back she may have been only friends with me for clout. She had a brother with autism she didn\u2019t get along with much. We were so close and at one point I thought I had found my found family. But fast forward a year and a half later we were at the other friends party, and since it was friend #2\u2019s party I asked her what we wanted to watch and she said mitchells vs machines since we both loved it. But then Patty wanted to watch the cowboy bebop reboot so we switched briefly. She later left to use the bathroom, and we switched back for a bit, then dinner and a game. so we kept fighting and it would go back and forth between both things. Until we agreed to Mitchell\u2019s. The next day we watch bebop. But then patty for a month has apparently held a grudge against me for watching mitchells over bebop. And she said how \u201cwe wanted to watch bebop but you overruled us\u201d when I did not, and made me FURIOUS with her saying that (more on that later), and then said we \u201conly watched what you wanted after bc we just didn\u2019t give a shit\u201d and told me to \u201csee a therapist\u201d and cut me off. She refused to see my side of the story. Now what makes me angry is if my ex girlfriend with autism who had a popular mom who worked for the govt and relative a cop, Patty would be the one cancelled. Patty is in the wrong, the birthday girl came forward later n said how she herself requested Mitchell\u2019s reminding me of so, and how the other guests didn\u2019t care what to watch (they were drunk) and other hated anime so she was a VAST minority.\n\nAnother friend I known for a long time our friendship got worse since I had a falling out with Isabel, as she got more suspicious with me. She then asked me for a \u201cpersonal question\u201d and I said \u201cno, sorry\u201d and then she blocked me, end of that. Then I briefly made a friend at my school who we both overshared with and we both had different types of autism (her pdd-nos, me Asperger\u2019s) and she didn\u2019t understand I had suicidial ideations one day and she took it the wrong way. Then a couple weeks later I told her I needed a break. Then a couple days prior to a party she changed her name. Then when drunk I accidentially said her old name and she took it too personally and then she blocks me. Turns out most of my friendships were awful.\n\nI know growing up and even nowadays I always would fluctuate between two things: quiet and reserved or I\u2019d overshare. Like often the minute someone shows an ounce of vulnerability I talk to someone like I\u2019m telling a doctor my life story. Well here\u2019s the thing, I always wanted growing up for people to see my point of view on things. Like when Patty accused me of \u201coverruling people\u201d well as a kid when I wanted to watch a different movie or do a different activity I\u2019d be in the wrong, or when I got my wish still in the wrong. Like as a kid in class when I wanted to watch something it was \u201cno\u201d and I was in trouble. Often growing up and even nowadays somewhat my parents made choices FOR me even if I scream and beg not to do something and why some things gave me anxiety but do them anyways. Like at age TWENTY, I wanted to do a meating with CAMh online, and my mom overruled me and forced me to do it in person despite a rant on not wanting to go drive there for a bad meeting (it was, the people there were rude), and I wanted to go to a concert that summer. Or wanting to go to a party one night at a bar in my hometown but my parents manipulating me into family night and them not trusting me bc \u201cdrugs it\u2019s not safe\u201d when I know how to take care of myself. Why is it that when I do something with people they are pissed at me for having my way but when I protest against others for their ways often because irs ablesit or somehow offensive, I\u2019m in even more trouble! \n\nAs a kid growing up people would never see my view or perspective on things, but they would instead listen to the feelings and voices of neurotypicals. Like I said, growing up yelling screaming and even certain noises and feelings like fists or being touched or people in my space is overwhelming but nope, nobody listened until I got physically violent to prove a point. I also know too growing up and now as an adult I have undiagnosed Adult ADHD, Undiagnosed C-PTSD, and undiagnosed BPD. For a whole lifetime I always suspected I had ADHD, like I was always very hyperactive and inattentive combined (latter more so) and despite my autism my adhd was obvious. My mom though didnt think so. And because of this I suffered for YEARS. My mom was even told by a shady ass doctor that \u201cadhd is under the autism umbrella\u201d and thought they can\u2019t be diagnosed seperately but my mom is stuck in the 90s somewhat with neurodiversity. It wasn\u2019t until recently my mom saw a YouTube video where it talked about an Autistic guy who struggled with it and his successes, as well as the fact he was diagnosed with adhd, and what comes with that, and they finally opened her and my dads eyes and made them realize \u201cyep, max was right, he DEFINITELY has ADHD\u201d and said \u201cnow that you say it, it was obvious from the get go\u201d and it was. And my mom apologized. I accepted but at the same time felt it was too late. My grades and social skills faltered because of it. \n\nOne thing especially I always struggled with was one impulse control, and two, maturity. I know ages 12-14 were the marking period of a lot of traumatic and stressful things in my life, where both teachers and parents mistreated me, I was always in trouble or placed in trouble for other kids and basically anything I said landed me in trouble, no matter what. Kids would say things like \u201cshut up\u201d I\u2019d be in shit but when I did I\u2019d be in more trouble. The next year I started standing up to myself. Punched a bully from the previous year and said an insult to fight back against him calling me a fag, a twig (I was skinny) and judging for my interests, and scared him that day and not only did he not tell on me but oddly he said \u201cgood job standing up for yourself\u201d. Then I stand up to the worst bully (she bullied me since grade 3) and they got a cop to verbally assault me, and he had NO REGARD for Autism. And that year until grade 12 I relied on a counsellor who would be my voice against my parents, since often in society people would rather listen to someone who isn\u2019t Autistic than someone who is Autistic, often because both a lack of understanding and stereotypes. When she left my life was fucked since. My parents relationship got worse until I saw a new therapist at 21. And I was 14 when I was bullied and mistreated, and abused emotionally by family, the height of it all. Then when the cop screamed at me it was the kicker. That was 2013, and that was the year my mental health went a million ways sideways at once.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve literally living above people, and it didn\u2019t help either that most of my role models tried to either infantilize, change, or stifle me prior to the pandemic. Hell I wasn\u2019t even allowed a goddamn email until 13 and my parents supervised that until 15. It did me more harm than good and i never understood much onlime skills until ironically the pandemic because of this. Most kids in middle school went to 7\/8 dances and I didn\u2019t, I was stuck at home being lonely. My lack of internet skills in high school fucked me up too where I often took posts personally and would be honest about feelings which led in backlash. And instead of an apology my parents are still \u201cstanding firm\u201d over it no it did me more harm than good with how so message people without sounding like a big paragraph and not a small text! My parents too were also those boomer parents who thought the internet was like the old west well into the late 2010s.\n\nAnd people growing up would tell me \u201ctoughen up\u201d, \u201cget to work\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re being lazy\u201d, \u201cexcuses\u201d and what not. It only made things worse. I told my mom too how \u201cmy untreated adhd and ptsd ruined my life\u201d and she said \u201dI agree\u201d. Nowadays I barely have friends, I\u2019m all alone and don\u2019t go out, because where I live (toronto) it\u2019s expensive and idk \u2026 too big. I only have one friend but I hope that doesn\u2019t fall out. I also have a couple friends on campus, and it\u2019s my and their last year and I want to get close with them or hang out with them a couple times before the year is over idk if I still can.\n\nIt\u2019s so sad looking over my life, and I feel like I lost 7 years of it due to mental illness. I want to make friends, or pursue a film career, but it\u2019s too late. I told people in elementary and high school I\u2019d find my \u201cgroup\u201d and I failed at that Bc I don\u2019t know social cues for shit, and this untreated ptsd and adhd has fucked with my life, and can\u2019t get it back. I\u2019m not sure what to do anymore.

I'm not a counselor, Dr, or even an expert at literally anything. My job description is as simple as \"Helping people with disabilities achieve their health, financial and social goals. I absolutely love and adore my job. This is the poorest I've ever been while working but the most satisfied I've ever been with a job, the feeling of pride when I help someone accomplish something they've been struggling with is a drug unlike any other.\n\nI also lucked out with my group of clients as they are all really cool people and not too much younger or older than me so I have a really good dynamic with all of them. That being said one of them (M24) is giving me fits with his social goals because he is incredibly isolated, he lives in a rural area and doesn't drive and his mom works a lot so she isn't able to give him rides to things very often. Which is where I usually come in. When I started hanging out with him for work he told me that this was the most socialization he's had outside of his mom and sister since he graduated 6 years ago. He's an incredibly lonely guy and laments his lack of experience talking to and meeting potential girlfriends etc.\n\n\nThe problem is, he has apparently spent the last several years of isolation on some dark corners of the internet and picked up some unfortunate ideas about women. He believes that everyone who calls themselves a feminist wants to kill all men and that \"modern women\" hate men and want them all dead and that he needs to find a woman who doesn't mind catering to him because that's the way it should be. And of course all the stuff about how women don't want him because he's too nice.\n\n\nI'm not saying this stuff to trash on him and I hope you commenters don't either. His ideas are clearly very wrong\/harmful and unfortunately not unique but I empathize with his isolation and while I'm horrified by some of the sources he cites when talking about this stuff I understand how a lonely young man can find comfort in them. I'm not excusing his ideologies I just understand how he got there.\n\n\nWhere I need advice is figuring out some gentle ways to steer him away from those ideologies. While obviously I'm not going to be judged negatively if he never achieves his goal of finding a relationship, part of me feels like since dating is a part of his social goals it is partly my responsibility to redirect him from those negative feelings and thought patterns if I want to help him expand his social options. \n\n\n\nI've tried telling him plainly that I don't agree with those ideas and I think that he should look to other places for comfort but that just shuts him down and he stops talking. I don't want to close the conversation forever by saying what I really feel about the things he's saying because apparently I'm the only guy in his life and when he was working with a woman before I joined he never opened up to her about this stuff and I feel like if I'm going to help I have to keep the lines of communication open.\n\n\n\nAnd then the even more important question, with the job description I gave you is this even my responsibility? Should I just ignore it and hope it goes away?\n\n\nAlso I promise I'm not trying to white knight or anything I'm plenty toxic in my own right and have a lot of my own shit I have to work on. I'm just struggling with how I should handle this. Because he likes talking about it and I'm going to have to have these conversations from time to time. \n\n\n\n\nTldr; I work with an extremely isolated young man in his early 20s who has fallen into a deep pit of incel ideology and I need tips on how to deal with it or if it's even my responsibility to say anything at all.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678675420.0},{"title":"How do I fight my overwhelming desire to be above others.","author":"Cautious_Savings_745","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pxuok\/how_do_i_fight_my_overwhelming_desire_to_be_above\/","text":"When I try to think of a world where i just accept that I am equal to others my mind recoils.

It's 1,000 miles, about a 16 hour drive. My mother was going to move to Texas for the same reason, but I asked her to come to NC with me for my first year to help me afford and acclimate and then she could continue down to texas if she still wanted to.\n\n\nMy goal is to get down there and buy a house as fast as possible to avoid renting.\nRight now I'm doing okay financially, I have around $15,000 cash, $15,000 in available credit lines, and then like $20,000-$30,000 equity in a house I currently own (and will be renting out after I move for extra income)\n\nI know I have enough to move, but I'm freaking out about financials because I don't want to blow all my money and not be able to get a loan for a house once I'm down there. Especially because I dont have a job that can transfer to that state, so I'll be starting fresh there (but I'm not worried about getting a job)\n\n\nMy main concern is *getting* there in the first place, as cheep as possible.\nMy mom and I have both liquidated most of our stuff so all we have can fit in a couple vehickes, and a small trailer. (We wouldn't even need the trailer but we have some irreplaceable furniture we are bringing)\n\n\nI have two vehicles, an SUV and a car. My mom has none. The plan was she would drive my car and I would drive my SUV pulling a small uhaul trailer.\n\n\nI went with a trailer because that's just like a $50ish dollar charge per day, where renting a uhaul truck is like $0.70 a mile, and then gas, and then $30 a day, and then that would have to tow my 2nd vehicle, so the car dolly would be around $50 a day as well.\n\n\nI figure renting a trailer would cost like $100-$150 where going the uhaul truck route would cost something like $1,500-$2,000.\n\n\nNow here is my delema.\nThat SUV is on its last leg. Basically ready for the scrapyard. The BIGGEST problems were that there's no radiator, no A\/C, and after tonight, no alternator. \n\n\nAt a very minimum for it to run, the alternator has to be fixed, which is like $500 apparently (according to google) And my dad is convinced if I don't have the radiator fixed it will never make it to NC pulling a trailer, so that's about $900ish. And even then, there are a plethora of problems like the a\/c unit being cracked (so no AC) and no blower controls. No windshield wiper fluid sprayers. Window regulators broken (literally taped the windows up)\nNot to mention it is covered in rust and has 270,000 miles on it.\n\n\nIf everything was fixed on it, Kelly Blue Book says it could only be sold for like $3,000. But it would cost way more than that just to have everything fixed.\nI don't want to spend thousands fixing it just to sell it for less once I'm there.\n\n\nDo I spend the money to fix the truck and use it to get me there then sell it? Do I just take a uhaul truck there and tow the SUV? Should I just scrap the suv and not even bring it? Is it worth fixing?\n\n\nI'm really worreid about money because I dont want to spend too much just getting there and then not be able to get a house and have to rent for god knows how long and basically throw away the money.\n\n\nIn an ideal senario, the alternator wouldn't have blown up, and the truck would have gotten us and our stuff there for like $150 and then all would have been fine. But now it looks like the cost to get there just shot up to like $2,000 minimum and I'm freaking out about it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678683987.0},{"title":"No body wants to help me and I'm not even asking for money.

Since the beginning, based on the things she would tell my boyfriend and he would tell me, I always knew she hated me. Things like making me pay him for gas money when we hang out, and not allowing me to stay the night in ONE of their TWO guest bedrooms when my power had been out for 5 days, because they \u201cjust wanted an empty nest\u201d\n\nI know they think I\u2019m mooching off their son and I\u2019m not what THEY wanted for their son. I\u2019m just sure they envisioned an upper class girl from an upper class family with 40 year old parents who also live on a lake and they can go on each others boats and have cocktail nights together and talk shit about other families in the area.\n\nBut in reality, I grew up in a low income household with divorced parents, and everything I have is from my hard work. I go to a university and will graduate with a bachelors in a year. I also work 4 days a week. I pay my own rent and all my own bills. I\u2019ve been working since I was 14. I\u2019m not that dream girl they envisioned and I think the mom is jealous of me for being so happy with their son. We really do love one another.\n\nThe problem is he\u2019s having a hard time putting his foot down since they do provide mostly everything for him. He said he doesn\u2019t want to ruin his relationship with his parents. He said he wants to say something to them, but doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to go about it. He said he\u2019s gonna attempt to stick up for me this week.\n\nBut it\u2019s exhausting.

I wish I had a healthy relationship with my (possible) step mom where we could hang out on our own and she would actually appreciate me and treat me like a person not an animal.\n\nPEOPLE OF REDDIT, PLEASE HELP.

I treid talking to her over text and she in essence said 'yeah forgot about what i said, you do what you want i take it back.' I asked her 'would u be happy if I invited you?' I just wanted to know what she said and she said 'I mean i only want things professional between us....' I mean i tried then inviting her twice, Second time was to a party at my home and she gave the excuse that she had to get ready for work the next day. Thats bs because she went out the previous day for a small event....\n\nI mean on one hand, shes upset because i didn't invite her. Then I confront her and she takes it back. Then I try asking her to hang twice and she Both said she was busy.\n\nWhy is she doing this? She says she wants things professional, but doesn't act. Why doesn't she just say, 'stop texting me, we aren't hanging out period.' Doesn't a professional relationship mean not to interact with me via text or anything.. \/??","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678683460.0},{"title":"Should I (23F) really leave my job?","author":"newrules-norules","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11q0jp8\/should_i_23f_really_leave_my_job\/","text":"I'm a new grad from East Asia with a degree in statistics and I wanted a data analyst position in Canada (I live in Toronto). I couldn't manage to find a position related to data so I'm currently working at a very small company with four people including myself as a project manager. The problem is, my boss is very condescending and micromanaging. \n\nI cried at least once a week for the past 3 months. I have a lot to say, but just to put out a few examples... my boss once told us how her nephew quit his job without lining up a new job. While she was talking about it, she suddenly pointed to me with her finger and said \"your generation has a problem.\" She repeated that 3-4 more times saying \"What is wrong with your generation?\" Then she also directed to one of my coworkers that's three years older than me, saying \"your generation is slightly better than hers (me).\" On the first day of work, when she was explaining things to me and I wanted to take notes of it, she said \"can you not remember what I just said?\" I'm also going to a trade show next week and she said I shouldn't be wearing a short skirt since it could give people the wrong message, which sounded very weird. She also uses the word \"retarded\" to refer to people that don't understand what she's saying. Most importantly, I'm a very inquisitive person but she often tells me not to ask her any stupid questions since she hates stupid people. Very discouraging. She sometimes brings us food and gifts but my friends call it gaslighting. \n\nI do cry a lot after work but I'm also not the type that likes to be \"obedient\" if that makes sense. I cannot hide my emotions very easily. So these days I'm starting to get passive aggressive towards her, don't look at her into her eyes and I think my boss knows that I do not like the job because she recently started telling me the perks of working at this company. She's also trying to give me more responsibility. I'm trying to stay resilient and not take things personally but I can't condone things anymore. I want to save money, pay my expensive rent without getting help from my parents, and apply for PR next year which is making me hesitant to quit the job. I'm trying to submit job applications after work but sometimes I don't have the time because of my lack of energy or my part-time tutoring job. \n\nI honestly don't know what would be the best decision for me right now.

My (27F) stepdaughter (11yo about to turn 12) has been going through a bit of a rough time lately. Her mom has a 3 yo son with her long time boyfriend, and she, SD, and the son recently moved out of his house into an apartment. \n\nThey are not technically split up right now even though they are living separately. It\u2019s honestly a pretty confusing situation: basically they weren\u2019t getting along and at one point were going to split up but now they seem to have decided not to. I honestly don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with that, but I do know it has seemed to have an effect on SD. They moved out of a 3 bedroom house into a one bedroom apartment and SD is now sharing a room with her little brother because of the circumstances. She has also been told the entire time that the move was temporary and seems a little confused by this. \n\nShe insists that she doesn\u2019t miss living with her mom\u2019s bf (they have been together since she was around 5 so she calls him her stepdad) and that the new place is fine, but her issues have seemed to ramp up lately, so I\u2019m not so sure. Anyway, the main problem is that lately she has been exhibiting a ton of anger toward her mom, and even went as far as physically attacking her in front of people and screaming about wanting to kill herself about a month ago. This obviously was very concerning to us as well because we don\u2019t support her acting this way toward anyone and especially not her parent, but we\u2019re also very worried about her mental health for obvious reasons. She said she doesn\u2019t fully remember doing it and that she sort of blacked out. My husband and I talked to her mom about getting her in to see a psychologist because we think it would benefit her at this point and she agreed but has not set her up with one. \n\nThe only reason we haven\u2019t done it is because we only have her on weekends. She has been telling many people about how it bothers her that her mom and stepdad smoke weed and that apparently she witnessed him selling it one time. They told her he was selling Girl Scout cookies, but at her age she was easily able to figure it out. She claims she will go in the garage and they will act weird immediately hiding what they\u2019re smoking and asking why she\u2019s coming in there. She also says that her mom won\u2019t listen to her about any problems she\u2019s having and that she feels ignored by her among other things. \n\nMy husband and I do not add anything negative about her mom to the conversation because we don\u2019t want to speak badly of her parent to her, but we do let her talk about how she\u2019s feeling because she really seems to need it. She has been very upset lately that she isn\u2019t able to live with us, and has started throwing 30 minute fits of hysterical crying and clinging onto her dad anytime we go to drop her off. I don\u2019t feel like her mom is abusing her or anything like that because she has generally seemed to try her best as a parent. Basically, I just feel bad about the situation and do not know what to do. We have to be very careful with what we say when we talk to her mom or else we risk not being able to see her as often, so this makes it hard to have a conversation about this with her. We have no money for a lawyer right now, so we have to tread carefully. \n\nHowever, I am very very concerned about her wellbeing, her mental health seems to be declining, and she is slowly becoming more negative in general and acting depressed sometimes. We don\u2019t want this to continue, but we\u2019re really not sure of what is the best course of action here. I have no experience with parenting outside of being her stepmom since she was 8, so I don\u2019t always know what the best way to handle things is. If anyone has ever had a similar situation or even just has some advice I would love the help. We just love and her want what\u2019s best for her.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678683028.0},{"title":"Considering eating meat again (pescatarian of 7 years) to gain some weight, but I hate most meaty textures, any suggestions on different cooking methods?","author":"brokenribbed","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11q0fk6\/considering_eating_meat_again_pescatarian_of_7\/","text":"I really enjoy a couple bites of pretty rare, bloody steak, but I can\u2019t eat much of it.

I still watch her kids  whenever asked to but will take my daughter to the hospital with me if need be rather than ask for help. I grew up very tough, homeless a majority of my childhood, and struggle with my mental health. I started therapy and she said it was weak of me to talk about my problems and that I better not start acting crazy if they put me on medication. I'm very proud of how far I have come and I am a huge advocate for mental health. I'm currently trying to get into college to be a counselor, and she scoffed and said that's probably not what you should be doing with everything you have. I try to be the very supportive friend no matter what, like hype her up and build her confidence, give advice or just listen if need be. When I talk about things I have going on it's like she gets angry and compares her life to mine, and says how easy I have it compared to her. I reached out at a point when I was feeling very low and just needed to talk, and she scolded me for feeling that way. I just need a friend and I feel like my friends are in fact not my friends.. Despite everything, I still try to help with the kids and watch them while she builds her own business. I feel like I cannot stand up for myself or I would be without a home. I also don't want to leave her high and dry with no babysitter.

Want to tell the bf, but I'm afraid of what might happen if I do due to her mother being terminally ill and her having strong manipulative and lying tendencies.\n\nI'm not sure how to summarize this... but let's call my friend Sally and her boyfriend Matt. Sally and I were best friends since we were 13. We had a few falling outs until we reached 20yo, and then from then on, our friendship was quite stable and we became closer. Right now, we're 23.\n\nFull story:\n\nThe last time I rekindled my friendship with her, she was going through a breakup with Matt who she'd been dating since high school because he wasn't giving her the attention she needs. Matt was in the military, and was often on deployment and did neglect to call her and she'd have to beg for his attention. For that reason, she broke up with him and was struggling to find another partner. She was on Tinder which meant she would get with guys that just wanted sex with her and would ghost her after.\n\nThen, later that year, Sally and Matt ended up getting back together while Matt was still away in the military... keep in mind that this isn't even their first time breaking up and getting back together. During the times Sally and I weren't in contact, they were on and off for some time. Either way, even though they were happy to be back together, the same issue kept happening where Matt was depressed and barely messaged or called Sally, and Sally didn't want to lose him again... So instead of breaking up with him again, she would go seek attention from other guys.\n\nApparently many many years before this happened, Matt broke up with Sally to be with another girl, and Sally never got over that. So Sally admitted to me that she cheated on Matt by having sex with one of her exes just to break even (Count 1). Matt from my knowledge is unaware of this.\n\nBut now fast forward to 21yo, she was talking to that same ex again this time around and flirting with him, telling me that she just wants attention because Matt won't give it to her and she's tired of begging him for calls and messages (Count 2). I admit that I must be a terrible person for this, but I kind of just didn't say much about it because I was afraid to... I was a pushover and a doormat (not an excuse) and I'd often get berated by Sally if I ever disagreed with her on anything and spoke up against something I didn't like that she did. I had no other friends and didn't want to lose Sally.\n\nThe ex was dating a girl at the time too, and things came to an end because that girl had found out about it. That girl didn't tell Matt, so... things were kind of back to normal again with Sally constantly complaining about Matt and me and her other friend collectively rolling our eyes at it every time. Around this time, Sally's mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer... so we didn't really want to make things worse for anyone.\n\nLater that year, Sally, her friend, and I ended up meeting two guys and I started dating one of them. Let's call this guy Frank. Frank and I only dated for a month until he broke up with me due to not feeling ready to be in a long term relationship, and I was crushed despite us having ended on friendly terms and him expressing his wish to be friends later on. I often told Sally how heartbroken I was because I really liked Frank, and it was my third time in a row being dumped. She spent half of last year comforting me, and seeing how heartbroken I was she, eventually started telling me how Frank is a player and that I was just one of the girls he played... she told me a few things about him that made me hate him a lot.\n\nLater last year, Frank messages me again, and obviously I was really mad at him about all the things Sally told me. So, I confronted him about it even though Sally told me not to because I wanted closure, and Frank ends up being shocked because apparently, a lot of the things Sally said were outright lies. He went through the trouble of even proving it to me, and this made him really upset... so then he ends up lashing out at Sally and then Sally lashes out at me for it. I was really mad at Frank for it (which was stupid, I know). He had a right to be mad, but I was upset because I still didn't want to lose my best friend of 10 years... it was dumb of me. But anyways, Sally and I blocked Frank and I definitely hated him now.\n\nI was friends with one of Frank's friends, so a few months after, I really wanted to vent about Frank to him and after the first few messages, Frank's friend sent me a screenshot of Sally saying some disgustingly sexually explicit messages... I was convinced it was photoshop and demanded that Frank speak to me directly about those messages, so he did and admitted that him and Sally sexted each other halfway through last year... I sent the screenshot to Sally and asked her if it was photoshopped and she admitted that it was and that she'd been holding it all inside for months and wanted to tell me but didn't know how... I was extremely shocked and numb and felt nothing, so I decided I would leave it all behind and forget about it and forgive Frank and Sally for what they did... until earlier this year, I thought about it more and more and realized that I was letting myself get pushed around by Sally and let her get away with all this lying.... and she had her terminally ill mother to hide behind as well as friends like me and her other friend.\n\nI realized she is a serial liar and manipulator, and I really contemplated telling Matt about all of this, but then decided against it because I really didn't want to set her off the edge and possibly make her hurt herself by removing the last person she has in her support system...\n\nThen today, a mutual friend of Sally and I's from years ago, who I kept in contact with, messaged me to tell me that Sally was sending sexual messages and trying to seduce a different friend's boyfriend. It just feels like everywhere I go, more and more terrible things keep coming out about Sally and I feel like it's time to say something.\n\nBut, knowing how much of a liar Sally is, and how she has a tendency to outright lie and manipulate people into feeling sorry for her, I am afraid of being roped into something crazy if I speak out.. and again, I also would hate to be the catalyst for making her mental health spiral. I feel like she could easily manipulate Matt into thinking I'm crazy and a liar... I only have one source of evidence that has no date or time on it.\n\nSo... what do you guys think.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678681272.0},{"title":"what can I do about the lack of intimacy?","author":"WishNobadluck","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pzvq7\/what_can_i_do_about_the_lack_of_intimacy\/","text":"My boyfriend and I haven't been sexually intimate in almost 3 months now I want to be I feel like he isn't sexually attracted or sexually desires me anymore I know it's a dumb thing to bring up but I feel like it's somewhat Important I love him and want to do things with him again but we haven't I believe it's because of arguments but even when we aren't arguing and calm still nothing happens I want to talk to him about this but I feel like it'll be weird and I'm very nervous to talk about it does anyone have any advice that can help me?

I didn't ask for said responsibilities, nor the pay increase, and my boss keep adding more responsibilities to my plate. \n\nIn the beginning my boss was pretty bad. Like yelling and berating you for following directions of the manager, who he hired. Like one instance, the manager sent me to take my break and upon my return, I more or less got yelled at and insulted in front of everyone. He got a little bit better over the years when he realized I never responded to his verbal tirades and he was out of the workplace for 6 months with a back injury. Most peaceful time of my life, if I'm being honest.\n\nRecently, he's started back at his old toxic habits and berating me and my coworkers due to his own personal issues. He has two small kids under 3 and hasn't been getting much sleep. Which is understandable, but not sure how productive that is to make his employees his personal punching bag? Recently, a patron complained that they were disappointed with their experience because the staff wasn't enthusiastic enough and my boss literally told us 'We need to be positive when we walk through the door'. \n\nI know, the hypocrisy is gigantic in that statement. He also admitted to something pretty illegal in writing in a group text.

We are also training new employees which can be a little tiring for me, because I'm expected to teach them a lot in a small period of time.

The first time he hurt me was when he cheated. But after a while of not speaking and then him apologizing afterwards I ended up forgiving him. The second time he hurt me is because I caught him talking to other females even though I tried giving him a second chance. After that I was completely done. So after me cutting him off entirely he ended up going crazy on me and threatening me with a whole bunch of crazy things. I made sure to have no contact with him and block everything. But after a while I just couldn\u2019t help but think of him. For some odd reason there\u2019s a soft spot for him in my heart. He\u2019s not even a controlling person either.

I try to engage her with outside activities or simply a board game but she prefers the television. Really the only way I can get her away from it so shopping. Which isn\u2019t good. Sitting her down and trying to have a conversation about this isn\u2019t gonna be an option she\u2019ll take offence to it and I\u2019ll never hear the end. It\u2019s really bad I think because when I have a question about something I have to whistle to her like she\u2019s a dog to break her out of the television zone-out. I hate doing it. I feel like I\u2019ve lost her. What do I do? What can I do?

As my mom works most days and I don\u2019t have a car or don\u2019t have any friends or family that have a car (let alone any friends I or they probably consider close at all as I\u2019m picky with friends) It was always school and then i went home and watched TikTok all day. After years it took a mental toll on me making me feel trapped. I don\u2019t like social media anymore and use it to give me something to do. Along with the trauma I\u2019ve experienced in this house and never being able to get out and having to deal with my shitty family and their emotional manipulation, etc.\n\nI\u2019m not too creative even when I try to be and so when I just sit off my phone and try to find something to do in my house off electronics, I end up not knowing what to do, how to be creative, or how to spend my time off social media in the real life. Trying to find something to do in a house you\u2019ve been cooped up in for years is difficult when your not creative or know what to do to have fun, Especially when your family is difficult and drag you down to their shitty level and being stuck at that shitty level.\n\nI feel even more trapped in this house as I\u2019m extremely clean and living in this house that\u2019s always a mess from my toxic family is mentally draining since I pick up their messes even though it\u2019s not my job. My family makes me uncomfortable and I don\u2019t want to be around them, i feel I\u2019m not achieving what I could be while living here.\n\nI\u2019m on the edge of graduating highschool and I was planning to get a job somewhere again after I graduate within walking distance to make money to get a car (I\u2019ve had a job before while balancing school but quit because I mentally was having trouble juggling both things along with feeling trapped in the town my whole life) \n\nI have all these dreams but after I while of trying to achieve these dreams i come back to reality after it fails and remember that I probably won\u2019t make enough money at a job in my small town when I need a car to drive to higher paying jobs, to get a place to leave as soon as I wished too. Then I get reminded of the shitty place I\u2019m stuck in and it makes me upset and sad because I know I\u2019m made for so much more than being consistently dragged down by my family\u2019s problems and living in this shitty home that makes me uncomfortable to live in and be around them. Im working on trying to get my mom to take me to get my permit as I\u2019m 18 before my papers for driving expire, but it\u2019s hard when my mother isn\u2019t a very good mother. \n\nI know I have problems too, this isn\u2019t all about my family, but I work on myself a lot with reading psychology books, reflecting on myself, healing trauma (while still in it), learning about cars and bills and all that to be good on my own to prepare for when i do officially leave, But I still feel as though I\u2019m not doing enough and im still wasting away at home, and living here without anything to do ever has formed my brain to not know how to respond to situations when I\u2019m given an opportunity, leaving me feeling like I\u2019ll be stuck under my family\u2019s \u201chelp\u201d and like I won\u2019t be good enough for the real world, friends and fun experiences, and can\u2019t suffice myself on my own leading me to feel like I need my family even when I don\u2019t, which also leads me to worry about my future and my hopes and dreams not coming to fruition. I dream about manifesting my desired life but i revert back to thinking about being stuck here and i dont want my dreams to come to fruition while I\u2019m still living here i don\u2019t want my desires and my current life to collide, i want to be healed living in my own place, sufficed by myself before I achieve a lover or true friends or opportunity\u2019s and experiences I deserve. \n\nAll of this makes me feel lonely not good enough and jealous when I see people on social media doing fun things and living life i wish I was. Even irl seeing people have friends to go do stuff with. I have to start from the very bottom by myself and work my way up to even be remotely close to where I wanna be and I\u2019m loosing hope.

The first thing that put me off tho was an instance where her dad texted me off of her phone and said she was grounded and was bleeding, but I doubt that that actually happened for reasons so I\u2019m not worried about that. But nonetheless it was a cruel joke to spring on someone you haven\u2019t even met. \n\nSo I finally get to meet her family and everything goes good and her dad has a private talk with me about how he didn\u2019t want us having sex or anything and I completely agreed with that. After that we had our first date and a couple of others, all while us going through 2 week portions where she was ground. I later learned these groundings were for things like missing a piece of clothing on the floor or not feeding the dogs. \n\nAnother thing that her dad had me come over for was, again, another talk about not having sex. After a while we finally said that we loved each other and we started saying it. This caught the attention of her parents and her dad sent me a long message about how they didn\u2019t want us saying that. I opened it but when I was talking to my dad about it, he said to wait and let him think of what kind of response I need to send. Well her dad saw I read it and got angry I left him on read. So we had to go through the process of meeting her parents and talking it out. \n\nAfter we went to homecoming together she gets grounded for about a month. When she finally calls me she told me her parents almost made her break up with me but were willing to compromise and I would have to come over and have dinners and just let them talk to me. I was okay with that because she\u2019s worth it. \n\nAbout a month later and her being grounded, they made her break up with me. Despite this we stay in touch through mutual friends (we go to different schools) and still consider ourselves together.

He said in the west, as teenagers, if you date even 1 grade or year outside your own, you could be easily labelled a pedophille. I actually experienced this first hand in my first week of moving here. I went to a park alone to just be with my thoughts and then these girls started calling me a pedo and saying I was only there to look at little children.  \n\n\nI really don't know what to do and any advice would be really helpful (especially those from the UK or who are experienced in this kind of culture.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678664636.0},{"title":"Is it normal for my dad to take away everything I have for refusing to poo as I farted once","author":"Acrobatic-Garbage404","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pyuyd\/is_it_normal_for_my_dad_to_take_away_everything_i\/","text":"Hello I am writing here for opinions on this.

He introduced me to different ways to smoke weed and so many different great bands that I had never heard of. We went to music festivals and threw house parties and had a grand \u2018ol time but throughout it all he was always very selfish and overall mean towards me. I was a shill towards him, having to convince my family and real friends that he was \u201cgood at heart\u201d, knowing that he always gave a bad impression on good people like my brother or my childhood friend. But in my eyes, he was teaching me \u201chow to be cool.\u201d Because I had never been in his world before. \n\nEvery band or movie he introduced me to gave me joy but in reality he, as a person, was the source of anxiety and  pain.. And he was using me because he knew I was a talented singer and needed someone to be in his band but looking back, I can clearly see that he never cared for me as a person. When I would have a good moment, he would always downplay it or shoot it down to make himself bigger, specifically in social settings like group gatherings. When I would express my admiration of a girl, he would try and bed her first, often succeeding because I was so shy and awkward back then. \n\nI lived, worked with him, and was in band with him for about four years. When I finally decided to quit his band because of his ways, he did everything he could to try and gaslight me. He gave me the bill for our cable weeks after I had moved and then claimed that I was stealing for not paying my share. Then he claimed that I stole his personal property.

I currently work at KFC in UK. I am a female, 4ft 8inches tall. I have worked at KFC for 3 weeks now. I have a new manager, she is aware of my height as everyone else is. Some of my colleagues are not being very nice about my height, making comments. I have been put on window 1 [drive thru window] where you basically stand there when a customer comes and takes an order and that's all. Without even trying other things [like making burgers, packing chicken etc] I was straight away put on window 1, due to me 'being too small for other task' which isn't right. \n\nThis store is short staffed so it means I am more around the burger station, packing and chute area [shelves where you put products like mighty bucket and popcorn] etc. And some of the colleagues do not like it. Yes, I may have a problem putting things on the top shelf at the chute, and reaching to get the fries. But all I have to do ask another member of staff to help me, that shouldn't be a problem at all. But some do not like to help me. I ask the member of staff who is at the chute to put the bags of products on the 2nd or bottom shelf so I can reach [shouldn't be a problem]. I asked the Team Leader on shift that day to put them on other 2 shelf but he didn't take any notice of me. \n\nOne of my colleagues then made comment whilst I'm on the front counter packing, helping out. He said 'that's why she's always put on window 1 taking orders, because she can't do fuck all'. The point I'm getting at is that all of the staff even team leaders and manager have put me on window 1 without thinking of me doing other jobs. They should give me a chance and not discriminate against me because of my height. I had a previous team leader even stop me from doing a job I am fully capable of doing. I have had people push me to the side, grab things out of my hand [whilst I was bagging chicken] for orders and told me to 'go and do whatever you were doing'.\n\nI feel very upset about all of this, I don't feel part of the team. Or if I said anything to possibly make a change, nothing would be done about it. I am actively looking for another job, but I do love the job itself, I just don't want to go to work to be bullied and discriminated against because of something I cannot control. Should I report this to the head office?

I make plans or talk to him. If I don\u2019t. We don\u2019t talk or hangout. Sometimes when i share stuff important to me he makes jokes, n generally makes iffy jokes. \n\nHe says our friendship means alot to him but I honestly do not see it in the way he treats me. Semi recently he isolated from people for personal reasons, meaning he didn\u2019t talk to me or see me in person for months. I thought it was like this was everyone. but he still hungout with his other friends at school, just not me? Him isolating is not uncommon, and with my past relationships the inconsistency of him messes with my mental health\n\nSo i\u2019ve realized with all this. He isnt the right person to have around as much as that hurts. \n\nso reddit what should i do? should i talk to him or let it fizzle out? \n\n* note: i have talked to him about the effort in the friendship, nothing changed. I understand people being an introvert however just not putting in effort to a friendship and being able to leave for months at a time doesnt work for me personally *","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678674465.0},{"title":"I\u2019m 26M and don\u2019t know where my life is heading.

I used to be a curious and naughty kid and got physically and mentally abused from my uncle and my mom(she was an orphan as a kid and probably didn\u2019t knew what it meant to be a mother) and my dad loved me a lot but didn\u2019t used to standup to my uncle. I became tough and started standing up to my uncle as a late teenager and that gave confidence to my dad and I had a great relationship with him.\n\nI always wanted to move away from my home because I didn\u2019t like anyone in my family except my father and also because I always wanted to become a successful entrepreneur and explore the world. But my dad never used to let me move out of the city. He would emotionally blackmail and manipulate me into staying with him whenever I got the opportunity like for graduation or for work. I loved him a lot because he was the only person in my life while growing up who make me feel loved.\n\nI started my first internet startup when I was in college. As always my mom and uncle used to demotivate me and even didn\u2019t let me install wifi at home. My dad too didn\u2019t support me until I started making good money and gifted my parents a pair of gold and diamond rings for their anniversary. I was 21 back then and used to work like 17-18 hours a day. \n\nAfter my graduation, I had 2 options either sell my company to a competitor or to move to Bangalore(silicon valley of India) and expand my team and company. I wanted the later but chose the first option under emotional manipulation of my dad. He gave me an idea to start an apparel brand and offered to help me with connections and funds as our family business is in apparel industry. \n\nI took his advice and started this in 2019 and in 2020 covid hit and I have no idea where 3 years of my life went away. I live a monotonous life now. Go to work in the morning, return at 8pm, mon to sat. Sure I used to work harder in my previous startup but I used to enjoy the process. Right now I make decent money as a 26 year old but it\u2019s still less than what I used to make when I was 21 and I don\u2019t feel like I make any impact in the world. I do employ 5 people and they consider me a good boss. Except that I like nothing about my work or life anymore.\n\nI don\u2019t think of my dad as a mentor anymore because I feel like it was selfish of him to not support me in what I wanted to do because of his own insecurities. I tried over 4-5 different online businesses while running my offline apparel business in last 4 years but nothing has worked probably because of not being able to go all in and focus on 1 thing.\n\nNow when I look back, I regret a lot of choices I made. But I don\u2019t know what should I do presently. I want to shut down this business and move to Bangalore and maybe work in a startup at a much lower salary than what I make being a business owner or do a MBA until I figure out what I want to do. But I have very little confidence in myself as of now. I feel like maybe I got lucky the first time because everything after that has failed. And if I do choose to shut down this business, I will be able to return all the money with interest my dad put in but I will have no surplus left because I will lose some money while winding down the business. So basically I created 0 value in last 4 years. I will also get a lot of hate from my family members for doing that and will get made fun of for being a looser. \n\nI probably sound pity and I know that my dad never put a gun on my head to make the decisions that I regret now. I want to know what could be the most practical and right options for me given the situation.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678624280.0},{"title":"Due to go abroad in 11 days, accidentally washed my passport","author":"chocotripcookies","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pxhuf\/due_to_go_abroad_in_11_days_accidentally_washed\/","text":"As title says, my passport was in my hoodie pocket and I threw it in the washing machine.

(But my parents and sister told me it is more common but not so much more and that sexism is not about hating women nor seeing them as lesser inferior beings, that it's about men having had the roles of power and control, because they were stronger so exerted strength to get them, etc. But that women were also thought to have a just as important role, in the home.) They said violence towards women is not about hatred towards women but instead about power, control, men being physically stronger and testosterone. And that the men who commit domestic violence are also the types to get into physical fights with men in pubs, etc.\n\nI believe it's thought that women like men as a gender more than men like women as a gender due to this. Because people think sexism means mistreating, hating, etc. And that it's thought women treat men better and with more respect.\n\nI believe it's thought that women like men in a more well rounded way than men like women, because of sexism and because because people think men objectify women  and \"only want one thing\" from women, and also that if you took sex away... men would prefer men in all other ways (they think women are unfunny, etc and they think that men are superior, etc.)\n\nI believe it's thought that sexism towards men is only a thing as backlash against sexism towards women. So women who hate men hate them for how men treat women.\n\nI believe traditional roles are not seen as equal but different and are instead seen as representing a belief that women are incapable and to serve men. I believe also that it's thought that women are defined by their relationships to men.\n\nI believe that when men do typically female hobbies and jobs women propel them to success and praise them for the bare minimum (which they wouldn't do for a woman with the same skills), like drag queens and gay male makeup artists. But women doing typically male jobs or hobbies are held to higher standards, have to prove themselves more, are not given the same support and are even verbally abused or threatened online. (Female gamers, female Mps, in sport, female celebs, etc.) And that there are boy's clubs that are hostile towards women in male dominated workplaces, but not girl's clubs that are hostile towards men in female dominated workplaces. I believe that having female main characters, idols, etc is not something many men want nor can relate to, while male main characters, idols are fine for women.\n\nI believe it's thought that women (especially teen girls) hate each other, get jealous, compete and have internalised misogny, but that men have stronger bonds, friendships and camaraderie. (Even though my psychologist told me that it's instead believed that women mostly support each other.)\n\nMy parents and sister told me I was wrong about all of these things and that most people don't think these things, my sister identifies as a feminist herself. But I asked this on this very subreddit and they said my beliefs are \"extremely common.\" And everybody on here tells me this whenever I have asked. Why the contrast?

I want the most useful (brutally honest if necessary) advice I can get. (Important details regarding most desired advice are followed by numbered bullet points). Have no concern over hurting my feelings, only relevance and persuasiveness.\n\n30M NEET collecting unemployment\n\nI live in Miami, Florida with my parents. I have next to no income, (about $200 a week), but I manage to live within my means. In a matter of months, I intend to pay off the debt I owe to corporations, and I expect to have a reliable passive income of about $1100-$2100, which will gradually increase. (Source is not important; let's assume this income is reliable; I wouldn't implement any of this if I didn't think the income was reliable; if income is shut off, I could easily rely on a support system to bring me back).\n\nI could barely afford anything in any part of the country, (much less Miami), but this would make me upper class in Vietnam several times over. I'm targeting Haiphong, Vietnam, (the cheapest large city in Vietnam that I believe has all the amenities I want). Vietnam is chosen in particular because I want a country cheap, developed enough, and with enough people I find attractive, (from dating apps, Vietnam has for the hottest people of any developing country). I would save about $1300-$1600 before I leave, enough for one month there, budgeting for (one-way) transportation, (about $900), $200 for lodgings, and several hundred for sundry expenses. Again, I would expect a month later to get $1100+, (at least $600 would be almost certain).\n\nThere, I'll get, (reserving a week prior), a place to myself 1bed\/1bath, where I can both get acquainted with living on my own for the first time, (I've done a bit foreign travel, but only for weeks, and rarely alone), and determining how it's like living in a country\/city both much less developed than what I'm familiar with, and with much lower general English fluency\n\n.Within a month, I'll try to get a 2bed\/2bath apartment (using Batdongsan.com.vn), hopefully well under $300 monthly, (looking at properties on that site in that city makes this seem very doable). I'll initially spend time making a close to ideal dating profile, (hiring a freelancer photographer if necessary, which should be well under $100), get paid versions of dating apps, (Badoo seems promising, but also Tinder, Bumble, etc.), and then start dating.\n\n\\-Principal questions-(I'm interested in advice on any point, especially whether Vietnam or any developing country is the right choice), but here's details I particularly want answers on)\n\n1.Dating: I'm looking to live with a(n attractive, feminine, feminine and <24 women and men) person I can love and be loved by as soon as I can, (<1 month), offering the extra bed and bathroom to them sooner as a test run. I don't mind dating however, which I would do by taking them to a nice restaurant, on the first date and future ones, and finding other things we would mutually enjoy, (though my favorite activity will always be conversation and perhaps cuddling). I think I'm reasonably attractive (somewhat muscular to average build to overweight, though I intend to decrease fat and increase muscle), but I think I would always be concerned with not having a strong basis for my (potential or actual) partner's affection, I would offer, in addition to my person and physical affection, love, attention, and taking them out to eat at a nice play once every three days, and then gifts, (like clothes), and maybe even just money, as a show of love, (I could probably easily give them well over minimum wage in gifts\/money). I wouldn't want an outright gold digger, (which I'm not sure I could afford), but, to get someone particularly valuable to me, especially in terms of attractiveness, I don't mind the relationship having a transactional element.\n\nI'm particularly concerned that, though I will only date people with some fluency in English, the language barrier will be an issue, (though using data apps tells me at least some people I would potentially date can at least read and write fairly fluently), that I won't actually offer enough to people, and that with such a mentality as above, I'm going to fairly unsatisfied with the sort of relationships I experience.\n\nNote: since I think I would particularly prefer unprotected sex, I would abstain from sexual (though not physical) activity unless I have confirmation the other person is sexually clean. Unsure if this is reasonable.\n\nNote: I've never been in anything close to a romantic relationship, and have never had significant physical intimacy with anyone, including sex.\n\n2.Career: I've been fired several times, but I have never been competent enough at any job. I have a BA from Florida International University, (Interdisciplinary Studies, so fairly worthless), I'm interested in a career in accounting, as I think it's a while-collar job that I can do remotely that will survive automation, (though very unsure about this), so I would spend 1-2 years getting qualified to take CPA, and then pursue remote accounting jobs. I don't mind severely limiting my earning potential like this, and even $30K a year would be fine, since where I'm living would be so cheap, and I'm willing to work for this much or higher, (obviously desiring more income), aiming for 35-50 hours a week first pursuing education, and then maintaining a job. (For reasons I won't go into, besides pursuing the aforementioned earning capacity and potential, I'm not that concerned about long-term finances).\n\n3.Family: As soon as I can, I would like to father children, (ultimately want 3+), assuming I can have relatively free reign raising them, (which would require a woman compatible with my intended parenting style, or raising the children without a partner, especially one who doesn't interfere). Resources (at least in raising them) won't be an issue, especially since I think I could get my parents to extensively support me more if I can provide them a grandchild. I've many ideas about child rearing, but this is it in a nutshell: from birth, and particularly once they've reached the \"age of reason\", (I estimate around six), while I would give them love, everything regarding their upbringing will be about maximizing their functionality and the likelihood of flourishing. I'm willing to be ruthless in these means, doing whatever it takes. My broad plan for them is making education early, rigorous, yet streamlined: the end result is that they will enter the US Military as an officer soon after turning 17 along with a bachelor's degree, (one is required), most likely to facilitate furthering their long-term career in either, (unsure which route is best), the military or once they leave it. (I'm extremely skeptical of the availability of jobs outside the military in several decades).\n\nI think this is is feasible if they basically work as hard as adults do in full-time jobs as a student as soon as possible, so they'll get bachelors' from the best college, (that offers them mostly\/fully covered tuition), and to get there they'll have best SAT\/ACT scores\/ACT scores, which they'll be prepared to do since their primary education will be narrowly focused towards that end.\n\nI'm not so attached to the means as much as the result of maximizing functionality\/conventional potential. This whole plan might seem wrong-headed, but I'm fairly pessimistic about the future and the availability of jobs for the next generation.. I'm expecting the West to basically become South Korea (and eventually worse) in my lifetime.\n\nNote: Particularly concerned with obviating my kids becoming socially dysfunctional, (since they'll devote so much time to preparing for exams), or psychopathic, (becoming a mass shooter is pretty far from flourishing). I'm open to some, (but fairly limited), socializing to prevent either of these things.\n\nThanks","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678673960.0},{"title":"How should I deal with my sister's disrespect and neglect of her child?","author":"tenalive","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pxc9x\/how_should_i_deal_with_my_sisters_disrespect_and\/","text":"Last year my mother passed away and My sister (f32) and nephew (M9) came to live with me (M40).

I by no means am having a mental break, *just stressed* and running out of ideas to help her get better. I need *advice* on *how to power through* *this* and *help my daughter* if there is anything I have missed or haven't tried. \n\nTLDR So my 19mo is having a bad week and I am at wits end teaching her how to be calm or express her needs. She is usually better during tantrums, utilizing a combination of ASL, pointing, and short words to express her needs - This has begun to change out of character.\n\nI think she is in a sleep regression, I can't be sure since the others weren't quite like this. It just feels different this time, but she is developing and changing, too, so that might be why.\n\nThe 'before' times.\n\nDown at 8\/9pm, up at 8am, begin nap around 1\/2pm for 3 hours, and repeat. No fuss usually unless she was teething or overtired. Havent had food strikes or bedtime strikes for 6 months - That was because 'Dada' wasn't home yet and separation anxiety was HUGE for her back then.\n\nThe 'now' times.\n\nDown at 8\/9pm, wakes up at 6\/7am, nap at 12\/1 for 2 hours TOPS and the shorter the nap the earlier she goes to bed, repeat. Earliest bedtime with a nap was 7pm, one day when she skipped her nap entirely stayed up till 530pm, then woke up 8am next morning. \n\nThe tantrums that have arose in the last 2 days, and I have watched her behavior spiral into this and nothing I have tried has worked. \n\n* \"I'm mad!\" At the top of her lungs sobbing.\n* \"Oh no\/Ow no!\" Screaming and crying.\n* Throwing everything she doesn't want.\n* Almost wanting to skip naps entirely. \n* Complete and utter breakdown over engaging in usual routines. \n* Grabbing her head and ears, saying 'Ow' yet *no ear infection or fever.*\n\nToday was the absolute worst of it for a variety of reasons. Last night she got bit by a dog. She is refusing ibuprofen, even quarter doses, to help her lower lip - the dog bit her lower lip, just two tiny pinpricks that almost look like she bit it herself it is *that* tiny. I was in the same room, just couldn't separate her in time before she pushed the dogs muzzle away and it reacted negatively. The dog kept getting in her face to lick despite our verbal discipline, pulling away, and redirections. Doggo was put straight into a kennel after the bite - Doggo isn't terribly socialized with tiny tots, and since it was only for a night I definitely do not blame the dog in this. Doggo simply doesn't know any better, the youngest in doggos life is 6\/7yo - Has never hurt that 6\/7yo, we are strangers to this dog in its home giving orders with a tiny creature it has never seen before. I'd be mad too. My kid went to bed at 1030pm last night and woke up at 930am this morning, Daylight Savings accounted for - As far as her circadian rhythm is concerned it was 830am. Tantrum off and on. Nap at, appropriately, 1pm until 3pm for a total 2 hours, and immediately tantrum - until we tried a bath, now she is back at it out of the bath.\n\nWe try not to abuse the bath to soothe her since it only works about once or twice a week. If she was tired in the 'before' times singing would work and ibuprofen if she was teething. Sometimes gentle rocking. I've tried letting her run around with lights out across the house to see it was 'nini time.' Otterpops are too hard textured, fudgepops are too sugary to try this close to bed, and BOTH 'Dada' and 'Mama' are at wits end over here. \n\nSome of her behavior for the week reminds me of a migraine or headache, could this be growing pains? How can I help her through this and how can I maintain my sanity through this regression\/ growing pain\/ whatever this is? And to encourage her to feel better after the bite?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678672308.0},{"title":"Being disgusted by a drink after being drunk","author":"Fl4ppyFox","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pr9la\/being_disgusted_by_a_drink_after_being_drunk\/","text":"M17, Europe\n\nMy favorite drink used to be whisky.

I am F(22) college student and this upcoming week I\u2019m going on our senior year spring break with my roommates. My dad was going to be visiting a friend in town around one of the days we\u2019ll be in the city for break so he wanted to treat us to something fun. He offered to take my roommates and I put on a boat for a few hours and he even offered to treat us to lunch if we wanted. \n\nMy dad is the type of guy that loves to host and do fun things for people so he\u2019s really excited and bought captains hats for everyone. Until last week, I had believed all my roommates were on board because they all expressed they\u2019d be down and it\u2019d be fun. A few days ago, one roommate expressed she found it weird that\u2019d we be hanging with my dad on a boat for a bit during spring break. The way I see it and explained it was that it was only 2 hours of the 5 days we\u2019d be there and it be a chill time with some drinks and maybe lunch. She knows and likes my dad and we\u2019ve hung out with all our parents plenty of times before. She agreed that maybe it wasn\u2019t as weird as she thought but I told her she was welcome to do what she was comfortable with if she didn\u2019t want to join for that part.  Then today I received a text from her that she doesn\u2019t think she wants to go on the boat and rather just chill by the pool which is totally ok. \n\nThe issue is that then another roommate casually commented shortly afte other one had texted me that if we wanted to we could split off in pairs and do things separately if there was ever something one person didn\u2019t want to do. I\u2019m unsure if this was directed at boating specifically, but while I understand it\u2019s a valid point it did hurt a bit if it meant 2\/4 roommates were no longer joining the boat. If just 2 of us end up going it def could still be fun but I know my dad is gonna take it personally which hurts me a bit. My dad is really excited and even bought cheesy captain hats for my roommates. I was gonna wait and see how it all plays out in case the one roommate changes her mind before saying anything to him. I know myself and probably one other roommate will still go regardless. Worst case scenario I\u2019d go alone to visit with him for a bit. Best case scenario we have another group of friends in the same city who I could extend the invite to as well possibly just to have a few more people.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna lie when I say I myself am a little disappointed, especially if only 2\/4 roommates are going. I don\u2019t wanna push anyone to do some thing they don\u2019t want to do and I know it won\u2019t make or break the trip, but I can\u2019t help but feel a bit bummed and weird about the whole thing. It\u2019ll def work out not matter what happens but I still feel a bit anxious over the entire matter.

It\u2019s the little things, the forgetfulness, the zoning out, the inability for his brain to continue to develop and the way it inhibits him to grow up. I\u2019ve voiced my frustrations, I\u2019ve told him that he can do it all on his own time and that I\u2019m here to support him. But for how long should I stick around and wait? He doesn\u2019t see a problem with it, he has his own business (which would be much more successful if he was clearheaded, in my opinion), and he is generally productive. He said he does want to stop but I don\u2019t want to take any further steps in our relationship (like moving in together) before I see some change. In the past year, since I\u2019ve quit, I\u2019ve healed and grown in so many ways that I feel I\u2019ve sort of outgrown our relationship. \nShould I give him an ultimatum? If anyone has any advice please don\u2019t hesitate. \nSincerely,\nNo longer dazed, but still confused.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678657686.0},{"title":"Problem with my Laptop's (MSI Modern 14 B11MOU) Internal Audio (Speaker Realtek (R) Audio)","author":"WhenURSane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pways\/problem_with_my_laptops_msi_modern_14_b11mou\/","text":" So last night i updated my windows and suddenly after i restarted, my laptop's internal audio doesn't work.

We met through our program at university, and we quickly became close friends. My family and I are not close and they are also overseas so her family quickly felt like my second family. They even had me over for Christmas one year so I wouldn't be alone.\n\nAbout half a year ago I was struggling quite a bit financially as I was paying for all of my own expenses (rent, tuition, etc) and Jane's family offered for me to move in with them and rent the basement in their house. I agreed as I would love to live with my friend and her family. I moved in about 4 months ago. Everything was fine at first, more than fine. They were very generous and had me eat dinner with them, they would have me watch tv and play games with them, and I felt like part of the family. However, things seemingly started to fall apart between my friend and me.\n\nShe stopped speaking to me around the house for the most part, and when she did talk to me, it was about cleaning stuff up. The energy was just bizarre, I don't know how else to describe it. I asked her family if they felt as though I wasn't cleaning up enough or not doing my part and they said no, and they also said not to take Jane's behaviour personally, that she was just stressed from school etc. I still tried to be nice to my friend but she seemed very disinterested in interacting with me.\n\nLong story short, Jane's family decided that they wanted to sell their house, and so we all had to leave for a few weeks in order for people to come to see the space. After I came back things got worse. It felt like they wanted me out of there as soon as possible and that my presence was bothering them. They barely spoke to me and I had to be the one to initiate a conversation. There were multiple times when I was asked to leave the living room and it was implied that I should just stay downstairs. I thought perhaps that this was all in my head and my anxiety was just making me feel crazy as nobody had told me outright that they were upset with me. \n\nWhen I moved out recently only my friend's father said bye, nobody else. I had a very chaotic couple of days after moving between school and work, but after things settled I messaged my friend's mom to say thank you for letting me stay with them. She read my message, didn't respond, and then also removed me from social media. We also had a group chat for the family and everybody has started leaving it.\n\nIt clearly seems like they all don't want to talk to me or have anything to do with me but I have no idea what I did to upset them so badly. My boyfriend thinks I should confront them as he knows them and he doesn't think I've done anything to warrant this type of behaviour at all. My friends at work think I should just let it be and wait for them to come to me: if I've done something to make them upset they should communicate it to me instead of giving me the silent treatment.\n\nI don't know if I should just let it go or ask them what's going on. This is hard because they were the closest thing I've had to family in a while and I genuinely don't think I've done anything to deserve this. If you have any advice on what I should do it would be appreciated.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678670785.0},{"title":"Should I go on a date with this girl?","author":"moonkie888","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pw605\/should_i_go_on_a_date_with_this_girl\/","text":"Long story short, met this girl on hinge, we have some friends in common, the date goes well but idk she went on this trip and she said she would lmk when she gets back.

We've been hooking up since Aug(exclusively), but I've known him for a whole year prior. We originally met on Tinder and talked for a little bit on Snapchat but never really went past the talking phase. (you know how most tinder matches go) We later found out that we have a mutual friend and started to get to know each other. He would hit me up every couple of months just to see how I was doing and asked about my car (he and the mutual friend are mechanics) and that would be the most of it.\n\nA couple of months pass and he finds me on Hinge. We start joking about how we can never seem to avoid people we know on dating apps. He says \"maybe it's a sign\". Things went on from there. He said in his messages that he was not really looking for a relationship at the moment but I still agreed as I had just escaped a bad relationship 4 months prior. I met him at his house a week later.\n\nI was doing really well initially but I've been starting to catch feelings these last 2 months. It brings a smile to my face to see his name come up on my phone, I love when I get an opportunity to invite him to my house, I love spending time with him, and I don't really have any desire to try and go out with other people. I am really trying not to get my hopes up but at this point, it is becoming difficult.\n\nHe told me recently that he may be getting deployed (he's in the military) and I am really thinking about confessing. I honestly couldn't live with myself if he left and I never told him. I'm afraid he doesn't feel the same but at the same time, he does things that suggest he feels some type of way.

Following his divorce from my first stepmother my senior year of high school, he remarried within 5 months and moved from Ohio to Florida without seeing me before he left, and I haven\u2019t had a face to face conversation with him since. \n\nMy father has always confused me. He was in and out of my life as a kid, often only appearing when he had a gf to impress and I probably didn\u2019t really start having regular visits to see him til he married my stepmom #1 when I was 8. He then started seeing me on weekends, but never had any interaction with my life outside these visits. There was no intermingling and while as a kid o was happy to see him, I later realized most of my time at his place was spent bonding with my stepmom while he played video games. He is a very closed off emotionally, only really going between being stoic, getting angry, or making fun of ppl and laughing. A lot of my social anxiety I think comes from our dynamic\u2026he always told me ppl found me uncomfortable to be around or that I\u2019m awkward\u2026and my moms side says this isn\u2019t true, but growing up I always hated having attention on me for this reason. I feel like I do have a few happy memories with him where I felt he loved me, which is part of why I\u2019m so confused how to handle this situation. He always supported my love of art and kept a studio space for me at his home. Took me driving when I was 16\u2026idk\n\nThe first time I stood up for myself with him I was 17. He didn\u2019t show to my high school graduation and the next time I heard from him he was telling me he got remarried via text. I didn\u2019t care if he wanted to get married, I felt more hurt he didn\u2019t feel the need to include me or even see me\u2026I felt like I was being pushed away. I\u2019d been trying to get closer with his new wife but this resulted in him really using me as the butt of every joke. He hung up on me when I called him and told him i felt like he used me to look good and was now dropping me now that I was basically 18 and he got what he wanted, which was to look like a good dad in front of her. He hung up on me and I later found out he\u2019d moved away without saying goodbye. This resulted in another screaming fight between us over the phone when I called him. After that I went to college and I never heard from him. He came back to Ohio and I\u2019d find out from Facebook but he\u2019d never try to see me. My sophomore year I tried patching up our relationship but he told me \u201cI could call him more\u201d and it wasn\u2019t on him to. Which\u2026just made me feel done. And I hadn\u2019t heard from him til this year.\n\nHe moved back to Ohio, married wife number 3 and started showing up and family events. No one warned me he\u2019d be there and actually I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s been telling family I\u2019ve been ignoring his calls (he has not tried to contact me) and his new wife has tried to connect with me. She seems very nice and I don\u2019t blame her at all, but I know he\u2019s probably told her a bullshit narrative. My grandmother is insisting he\u2019s changed, but he has yet to actually try and speak to me. He doesn\u2019t look at me at these parties and pretends I\u2019m not there. I\u2019m super drained by the stress of being in small gatherings where he\u2019s there and ppl keep telling me I\u2019m being stubborn. \n\nI keep thinking about what I\u2019d do if he did try to fix things\u2026and I honestly don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do. As of rn I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s changed at all and it hurts as it always has to have a parent not give a shit. This behavior falls in line with his history of appearing with a new woman. On the other hand, if he does have regret and is just scared to talk to me, I don\u2019t know this man anymore and he hasn\u2019t been in my life for a decade almost. It hurts my heart, but also I don\u2019t like him as a person, so loving him and accepting him seems like it\u2019s own kind of pain. I also am unhappy with my family, but I don\u2019t want to isolate myself even further. Some of them have been supportive and some I think might just not know how he is. Regardless I think this might be building up to him putting me on the spot in front of them eventually and I don\u2019t know how to handle it.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678668925.0},{"title":"crush on guy at work","author":"eastbro","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pvg45\/crush_on_guy_at_work\/","text":"I work at a grocery store and there is a guy that started working there less than a year ago that I see every day despite being in different departments.

It\u2019s worked out very well for me and while I am not cured I feel better than I have in years. Here\u2019s the problem my husband and children hate the food. My husband wants me to either stop the diet or cook three meals one for me, one for him and one for the kids. I already cook a separate meal for the kids because they are autistic and have food aversions. \n\nA little backstory my husband is an extremely picky eater, probably also on the spectrum. Before I went plant based he would eat what I cooked at most 2-3 days a week. He usually would end up getting fast food. Now that I am eating plant based he is never eating what I make. He is upset because he says he misses home cooked food. I offered to grill up some chicken, ground beef, etc. for him to add to what I already am making but he won\u2019t touch any of the plant based food. \n\nSide note. My husband doesn\u2019t cook, but he does the dishes. I stay home with my children because they cannot go to daycare or full day preschool because of their autism. (They won\u2019t accept them). My husband has a long day, gone 7-7 working in an office. I know he is tired when he gets home, but I\u2019m also exhausted myself in the evening trying to keep the kids entertained and safe. My health condition makes it really hard to get through the day sometimes. I have considered making my own food at lunch time, but it would mean more screen time for the kids and I feel like they already get too much. They use iPads while I make dinner so they are safe and occupied (please don\u2019t shame me for this I am in survival mode raising two very young autistic children and I do my best). \n\nAnyways I am looking for some advice.

When we met she was in a dark spot with her brother and I felt pity on her so I gave her more patience when I saw red flags as she tried getting a relationship going between us. She lied a LOT to make herself seem wealthy, kind, forgiving, and understanding so I figured I would give her a shot at the relationship, not realizing that they were lies.\n\n During the relationship, she sexually abused me twice for my v-card, told mutual co-workers about the sexual encounters, playing it off as completely consensual when it wasn't, despite me telling her in person that I regreted it and wanted to pretend it never happened, and showed extreme arrogance when I tried helping her with her brother situation. After about two months I was fed up with the abuse, arrogance, and blatant lies. I broke up with her.\n\n A month later, the night before school was supposed to start, she messaged me saying I should keep my distance or else I might get hurt. I kept distance for personal safety, but she would actively choose to sit at my lunch table because we had shared friends. One day, a few months into school,  she followed me to one of my classes and threatened to punch me after I told co-workers that she threatened me (calling the false rumors). I reported this and the first threat to school resources and managers at our job.\n\n Now (both of us are 18) she keeps her distance but continues to sit at our lunch table, even trying to strike up conversations with me as if nothing happened. I know if I tell people she'll threaten me again or hit me but she sits right across from me and plays her sweet angel card for the people there. I have moved tables when she comes over but I worry that the passive aggressiveness of it might trigger her as well. Note: a few of my friends at the table don't like her either for different reasons but they pretend to like her to prevent drama.

I have a grandmother (dad's mother, 66F) who I rarely saw in the first few years of my childhood, and when I did, she always acted negative towards me and my mother. She started becoming involved more when my little brother (9M) was born, and she has always adored him, even referred to him as her \"first grandchild\", in front of me, which always made me confused, this would always end with me crying and my mother taking her into another room to argue quietly.\n\nWell because I have not been able to get my passport wihtout my birth certificate, unless mom does it for me, I decided to sneak in her room where I found the lock box where I know she keeps the stuff. I'm going to be honest, at this point I was pretty pissed off and I through the box off the balcony to get it open (my parents hide the key).\n\nI found the familiar envelope where my birth certificate is and while I found my birth certificate, it showed that my birth last name was my mother's maiden name, and only my mother was listed on there. A paper found with it was an adoption certificate showing that my father adopted me when I was six. I called my mother demanding to know who my biological father was. My mother came home, and we had a huge argument. After we calmed down, my mother explained that my dad is my biological father, and that he just did not sign the birth certificate at the time because he was fresh out of high school and did not want to pay child support, and that he acknowledged paternity later.\n\nI didn't know whether to believe this, sure my dad was fresh out of high school, but the adoption papers did not make since to me. I talked to my friend later that night and she told me that the story is not believable at all, and that I should ask my dad about it. Mom told me not to tell dad about me finding out, which made me believe more she was lying. I talked to my dad later by saying that I found the birth certificate but did not tell him that mom knew. He told me he did not sign because his mother was angered by the fact that he got my mother pregnant before marriage, he only turned eighteen three days before I was born, so he could not marry my mother without his mother's permission, which she refused to give because she did not approve of my mother and talked him out of singing the birth certificate.\n\nI feel like one or both of my parents are lying, and I need answers. he also told me not to tell mom I found the certificate, as she would be really upset. So now they have secrets against each other. I feel I need answers and my friend told me about this subreddit because I am confused on what I should do, and this is honestly making me question a lot of things. Should I take a DNA test? should I talk to my grandmother if she knows something? I am just very confused and if I do have a bio father out there, I want to know about where I come from, but my dad is always going to be my father.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678654971.0},{"title":"How can I help my best friend get sober?","author":"stonedbunni","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pprmg\/how_can_i_help_my_best_friend_get_sober\/","text":"My best friend (21) has been on a lot of different drugs over the last 5 years, to the point where I can\u2019t even talk to her because it is hard to comprehend her or understand the things she is talking about.

But I can't help but feel anxious and hurt if she doesn't express a certain amount of love or is prioritizing something (or someone) above me. Or feel abandoned if she can't hang out with me. I sometimes get anxiety if she doesn't reply quick enough or shows me her full attention. She isn't a distant partner by any means and it isn't her fault that I feel this way. I have something mentally wrong with me that causes me to overthink and feel this way but I don't know what it is or how to stop it. I never take these emotions out on her or act controlling by any means. I understand she has her own life outside of our relationship and I truly would rather her to enjoy spending time with her friends and family as well as priotizing her studies than focusing all of her attention on me. I really want what's best for her but I also want to stop feeling so needy all the time. I have told her how clingy and needy I feel and she is completely understanding and supportive of me. This is something that I am 100% at fault for and I'm desperate to find a solution to it so I can move forward with our relationship. I understand that it is normal to feel clingy at times. But normally when people feel clingy they just want they're partner more. But when I feel clingy, I get depressed, anxious, and feel abandoned. It just pains me so much that I'm like this when she doesn't deserve it. I know and trust that my girlfriend loves me. But it seems the only way I can feel loved is through attention and affection. \n\n\nI just want to feel safe and secure without having to worry all the time and not sabatoge everything. I also think it's worth mentioning that I never feel this way with other friends or family. It's only her and when I was in a relationship with previous women I've dated. It's nothing to do with her and I would probably feel like this no matter who I was dating. I have a doctor's appointment here soon and plan on trying to get in contact with a therapist to help me out. But in the meantime I just want to be safe and secure and to just be a normal person and stop overthinking so much about every little detail. I am on here in desperation for advice because I just want both of us to be happy.

She was (and still is) tracked with her phone and seemed to be very organised and sane for a child. Now that we are growing up we both notice how a lot of things her parents do aren't normal and very manipulative. Her mom is very overprotective and doesn't allow her to be outside after 6 pm. She always tells Her that she's a whore because she has male friends and says that she probably screws around with everyone of them (she's not that type of Person, actually quite the opposite). One time we went outside with a group of friends and since she's not allowed to be outside after 6 pm she was a bit late, so her mom called her and was like \"no where are you im picking you up right know stay where you are\". She also had her tracking thing turned of, because she's not allowed to be where we were (which was a normal way around a lake). When she got in the car her parents started to fight. Her dad tried to defend my friend and then told her, that it is her fault that they were fighting. She pressures herself a lot, especially in school. She has all A's except for two B's. We always considered her situation as normal and not so Bad, because she overall seemed fine on the outside. When I try to talk to her about it, she always says \"but I like my parents they do so much for me\". But the actual reason why I'm writing this is because yesterday I realized how serious this really is. We were at a friends house with almost All of our friends and our friend group is really close. Some of us, including myself, don't drink generally, but the rest usually drinks a bit (except for that one friend who always drinks too much lol). We went out to buy some stuff (mostly alcohol) when my best friend noticed that she hadn't eaten in two days. But she didn't sound concerned it was more like \"Oh you know what I just noticed, I didn't eat for two days\ud83e\udd2a\". Then when we got back everyone knew and we tried to get her to eat something. She didn't want to because she \"wasn't hungry\". She wanted to drink and most of us stepped down and told her no. But that one friend that always drinks too much didn't give a shit (lol) and they drank together. Obviously that wasn't good and she got really drunk. Like reeeeaaaaally drunk. I was pissed at her because she drank though she told me she wouldn't and honestly I was a bit scared of her because I've never seen her like that. We All were in a room with a big TV and a couch and she with another friend was in the bedroom. But then she came in and layed down between me and one of our friends. I was stilled pissed at her so I didn't care but then she started to talk. She talked about her parents and that she is a disappointment to them and that she has such bad grades and that maybe her friends would like her if she looked different. It Was All very emotional and she started crying. I was also crying before that (but only like a few tears) and then my other friend started crying too. I can't get this moment out of my head, when we three were All on the couch crying together. Fun fact, the others were watching wolfes of Wallstreet and there were a lot of naked women in the background. Anyways, she also ate something, but only because she had promised she would and she had such a bad conscience (but I guess a win is a win). When she was in bed trying to sleep she still wanted to drink even more, which scared me a lot. She has had panic attacks in the Past and hyperventilated to the point where we had to call an ambulance. Now she hasn't eaten in two days. She also can't sleep at night and usually gets about two hours sleep per night. \nSo now we Don't know what to do. We can't just let it stay this way because of what will maybe happen in the future. But we also can't do anything, because either way it would make things just worse. I'm trying to be there for her and I know that she knows that and I'm trying really really hard, but this eats me. I cant sleep, because I know that she isn't sleeping right now. But then I also feel bad that I make this about me. Today me and that friend whom we were crying with talked about yesterday and what his \"plan\" now is, first to talk to her parents (they want to meet all of us before she can come to any more parties) and then he also said that she just needs her friends, especially me.

We went out for dinner last night. My previous relationship ended coming up on 6 years ago on the grounds of me being cheated on which has left me with significant trauma in the way that it occurred. My girlfriend did some volunteer work at her brother's bar Saturday night and offered to let me use her iPad as I was at her place that night and hadn't brought mine. As I was finishing up I noticed her exes name in her messages app, whom she had broken up with just a few months before me, and I open it to see that she had been messaging him around my birthday just over two weeks ago with the last messages being just a few days before. She was the one to initiate contact with him generally just asking what he had been up to, this then led onto her asking if she could see him as they live quite close to each-other, asking if she'd ever see him again, and apologising for how things ended with him. I can see from his replies that he declined to see her. I confronted her about this to which she responded that she didn't think she had to defend her privacy from me. She then proceeds to tell me that I don't know the full story of how they ended and that she broke his heart and always felt guilty for it. I somewhat accept this, we hug for a little while and we move on kind of.\n\nFlash forward to later in the evening, we stop near the park near her house, where she proceeds to give me the full picture of why she and her ex ended. She claims that towards the end they were both unhappy and that she ultimately cheated on him which caused the end of their relationship. She claims to have reached out to him out of guilt after hearing my story. She has apologised to me for this and says she regrets reaching out and knows she never should have messaged him. She blocked him shortly after. It is at this point she proceeds to cry and talk about how I deserve so much better than her and that I'm too good for this world. The conversation generalises about trust until we bring up a prior incident that occurred around two weeks ago, in which she claimed she was going on a walk with her father only for it to transpire that she had in fact gone on a walk alone and had admitted to lying to me. She then proceeds to reveal that this was too a lie and that she had in fact gone for a drive with a male friend who is also in a relationship. She then tells me that the male in question forced her to perform oral sex on him, threatening that if she didn't he would drive off a cliff. I try my best to see things from both ends with this. I let her know how angry I am that she lied to me and betrayed my trust, whilst also comforting her as this is rape(provided her story is true). I ask for the guys name which she didn't give me as she believes this will ruin this life. I say my piece and ask her what she would like me to do, she asks me to please not leave and to stay, but would understand if I didn't want to see her again, which I say I will. We walk back to her place and spend the rest of the evening watching tv somewhat silently. She's currently asleep in bed as I'm making this post. We have spoken this evening and have laid out some ground rules going forward. This was her idea as she says she's never known a love like mine before and that no-one has ever done the things for her that I have. She claims to be scared to death of losing me. I am at her beckon call more or less 24\/7 and spend most nights on facetime even while we sleep.\n\nI want to make peace with this so badly as I know our love is real, the realest I've ever known. Things feel somewhat normal tonight but I don't feel this is something I can just move on from overnight.\n\nEdit: she has also proceeded to begin unadding all her male contacts from snapchat, iMessage etc. not because I asked her to, she chose to. She has promised several times tonight that she wants to be better and will try to better and that she will love me the way I deserve to be loved.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678667302.0},{"title":"I fucked up.","author":"Blankusernamees","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11puu3x\/i_fucked_up\/","text":"I just left my girlfriend. I had to do it because I realized that I'm not the right person for her. Despite my love for her, I felt numb in the relationship, and I knew deep down that she deserved someone who could give her everything she wanted.\n\nOne of the reasons for the breakup was that she was always talking to her guy friends on calls, including her close guy best friend. I couldn't help feeling insecure about their relationship, and I knew that it wasn't healthy  for our relationship.\n\nEven though I tried my best to be there for her, he seems to be the one she turned to when things got tough. I felt like I was always second best.\n\nWhat made it worse was the fact that she had known him for longer than she had known me, and they had a connection that I couldn't compete with. Even though I understand the importance of having close friendships outside of a romantic relationship, it still made me feel like I wasn't good enough for her.\n\nmy heart still aches with the realization that I may have made a mistake.\n\nI already want  to call her and hold her close again, but I know that I can't. I'm the one who ended things, and now I may have to live with the consequences, \n\nThere's this thing that's holding onto me so tight - my love for her. It hit me too late, but now I know for sure that she's the one thing that my heart beats for above all else. Losing her made me realize just how much she means to me, and I can't deny it any longer - she's the most important thing in my life.\n\nI wish I had recognized my feelings earlier and expressed my love to her. But now, all I can do is hope that fate will bring us back together, so I can tell her how much she means to me and how much I need her in my life. \n\nDespite being the one who broke her heart, I'm determined to make things right and win her back. I know I made a promise to never hurt her, and I regret not fulfilling that promise. But I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make things right and show her that my love for her is true and everlasting. Until then, I'll carry this love with me, never letting go, and always hoping for a chance to make things right.\n\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if someone could offer me some guidance and support during this difficult time.

Basically, I am looking to study filmmaking in September and I have received offers from two universities. Now that I have visited both university's, I genuinely can't decide which one to pick. \n\nThe first university is more esteemed, and has the superior work environment as it is solely dedicated to film. The University was built recently so it is very modern, and has state of the art technology. All of the staff work within the film industry and the course looks incredible. I would be more likely to get connections in the industry here. I was also offered an 'emerging talent' bursary (about $500)(which just means they give you some money and you don't have to pay it back) for my portfolio that I showed them. The downside is mainly the location of the university. The city that it is located in is notorious for being a terrible place to live. Most of the people I encountered were pretty rude, and the whole place surrounding this state of the art university is dirty and unappealing Also, because this university is closer to my house, I would have to still live with my parents, which make me feel like I'm missing out on one of the main parts of uni, which is living with and getting to know other people outside of class.\n\nThe other university is in a much better location. It is located on the seafront, with very nice weather. The university is also very nice, but the course, while still being pretty good, is quite far off the level of the other one. This university isn't dedicated to film but rather has many different courses. Film being one of them. The people here were a lot more friendly and talkative and is was just a very pleasant place to be. Another benefit of this university is that not only would I get to live there either on my own, or with other students, but I also get free membership to the Universities gym, pool, sauna, and other things. I have been trying to get in shape, so having a free gym so close to where I would be living would help a lot.\n\nI am having a hard time choosing. Should I go with option A and pick a better course but miss out on a lot of the social aspects of uni, or pick option B, a worse course but in a better location, being in a more sociable environment and gainingcsome independence by living on my own?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678665932.0},{"title":"I have no friends in 1st year university","author":"anonymous_46290","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pubdo\/i_have_no_friends_in_1st_year_university\/","text":"I f(18) have made no friends in university.

Normally, this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. But it is. And it\u2019s over the most insignificant fucking thing. I don\u2019t know there to start so I\u2019ll try to start from the beginning.\n\nMy brother and his girlfriend got together than a year ago, in July. she was moved in a week. She even had her damn cat moved in a week after that. But they both seemed made for each other. They were both happy together, and my parents and I both adored the GF, as she seemed to make my brother happy.\n\nQuickly, within weeks of their relationship did the gf fall pregnant with a kid. I\u2019m gonna be honest, my brother is 21 but is not an adult. He has far to go to grow up as he still only thinks about himself. Even through the pregnancy he always claimed he would spend his money on games he wanted, not the baby. He was still immature and not ready to raise a kid. But they got through the pregnancy together and gave birth to a beautiful baby boy just 2 weeks ago.\n\nRecently, both before and after the baby, they both have been acting very hostile towards my parents. Never an issue with me, but my parents began to have to walk on eggshells around their own house to keep my brothers gf happy. For whatever reason there was always\u2026 tension. Though they never had much issue with me. I\u2019ve no idea how she felt about me, but at the very least I know she found me funny. But she turned on my parents, and my family, within the past couple of months. And in turn, turned my brother against us all too. \n\nEven before the baby was born they never left my brothers room in the house but especially after the birth we never saw them. They were constantly hold up in their room with the baby day after day. Not wanting to be around any of us at all. They\u2019d only ever come downstairs when they wanted to smoke or to go to her mothers house, which even the latter was rare these past two weeks. Even with no kids myself I cannot understand how much of a toll such a life would take on any new parent. But this baby has been nothing but a weapon against my parents and I since he was born. \n\nIt\u2019s about now that I want to go into more detail about the GFs cat that I mentioned, because it\u2019s around this that the tension turned into full blown civil war.\n\nAt this point, we had 3 cats in the house, her cat, that we\u2019ll call N, my brother cat P and my cat B. We\u2019ve had B and P since they were kittens. They\u2019re super well behaved cats that came from a bad home. They\u2019re full grown now and so we\u2019ll behaved they don\u2019t eat out of each others food bowls. They can be discouraged from doing or going anywhere they shouldn\u2019t with a single \u201cpsst\u201d. They\u2019re good cats. \n\nN is different. Since the GF brought her into the house she was nothing but nasty and vicious. She would scratch and claw anyone that came near her. The GF had to carry her while holding her front paws to make sure she didn\u2019t get scratched. No one was safe.\n\nAfter the baby was born, brother and the GF neglected N not allowing N in their room and not feeding her. They didn\u2019t give her any attention. They cat was depressed. As nasty as it was, I felt bad for it. But despite their neglect of N, GF accused my parents of being cruel to the cat and treating it badly. This is where my parents decided to tell them the cat needed to go back home. But even GFs mum didn\u2019t want the cat back. So wherever it ended up I don\u2019t know.\n\nSince then they had it in for B. They say he hissed at the baby and got fur everywhere and needed to go. Not N or her fur, or P, my brothers cat. Just B, my cat. Only his fur was an issue for the baby. I called them out on this hypocrisy but they claimed I cared more about the cat than the baby.\n\nI refused to let them only get rid of my cat though. It didn\u2019t seem fair nor did it make sense. It was hypocritical. And because my parents were on my side with this, GF and my brother moved out today. And since they did they\u2019ve been nothing but vile and disrespectful. Calling my mum selfish and always having a new issue with GF, though was never specific about what these \u201cissues\u201d were. It was always vague.

Every booing they tried to gaslight my mum into thinking she was the villain. And then essentially told my brother that I didn\u2019t consider him welcome in my home any more. He wasn\u2019t acting like my brother. He wasn\u2019t my brother any more. Ai was cold, I was calculated. I was upset and wanted to hurt him the way he\u2019s hurt me and my parents.

But I don\u2019t know where to go from here. No one is only my brother OR the GFs side. But the situation is just fucked. On of my older brothers doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on right now because my mum tried to protect him from the situation. I messaged him a few hours ago about it but he\u2019s not seen the messages yet.\n\nI just want some advice from here from some others with more life experience. Where do I we go, what do I do? Is this a lesson my younger brother needs to learn or are we being inflexible? It tore me apart to tell my brother I\u2019m essentially disowning him but genuinely hope it hurt him the way he\u2019s hurt us.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678665506.0},{"title":"Help with what to do tomorrow after my stay at a hotel ends.

I was never heels over my head about her and I don\u2019t think I was ever in love 6 months in, but I did get strongly attached to her and she was so caring and nice to me. Then back in November I got kinda attracted to someone else and thought it was a pretty good sign of how my relationship was not really meant to work.\n\nI got cheated on in the past by someone else and I believe this had a strong impact on my decision to break up this time (the whole \u201cshe deserves better than someone thinking of another girl\u201d \/ \u201cI don\u2019t want to recreate what I went through\u201d type of thing).\n\nThat was back in late November.

I know people around my age are all struggling. They have just graduated from college, trying to start self-sustaining life, get a job, and become an adult.\n\nI have already achieved all of that. I have been working in the software engineering field for 5 years. I have established my career, and I can get enough salary to maintain my life while having the freedom of choosing what to work on. I am not financially independent yet, but I have enough savings to enjoy life while doing nothing for a few years. \n\nI have friends. Friends with who I can rely, friends with who I can have fun times, both inside and outside of work. I know what I love and what I want to do. I like programming, and I like my job. I have hobbies that make me fulfilled - playing synths, skiing all across the globe, etc.\n\nI have several psychological disabilities, including ADHD and ASD, but now I know how to treat them. I take medications in a formula that I have found works perfectly for me. I no longer feel depressed, anxious, or distracted. If I want to work on something, I can focus on it. I have practiced neurotypical social behavior, so I am socially functioning well. Nobody knows I have ASD unless I tell them. \n\nYet, I don't know what I should do now.\n\nIt feels like fixing a broken car for 20 years. The engine is broken, so you spent 3 years to make it start. You have also found the car has flat tires and spent another 4 years replacing them, just like debugging. Whenever there is a problem with yourself, you figure out the problem, find the solution, and apply it. Now the car is fully functioning and can drive in any hazardous environment. Suddenly you find out you have nowhere to go. You have a vehicle that can take you anywhere, but you need to have *the desire* to go specific place. You don't have such desire, so just decide to go to Walmart and bring some Sprites. What a waste.\n\nThe problem is that my desire needs to be stronger to maintain my current situation. When I started programming, it was stimulative, so my brain could get obsessed with it. I have studied all the historical and theoretical backgrounds of computer science. After working in this field for a few years, it no longer gives me the same degree of stimulation. It is fun, I would write some code instead of playing games in my free time, but I am not *enthusiastic* about it. I get quickly bored and watch some youtube after writing like few lines of code. \n\nThis could be burnout, but I know what it feels like to be burnout. Your last spark of passion in the heart gets extinguished, and the only thing you want to do is retreat from everything. Staying in your room, sobbing and regretting your past choices. I am not like that right now. I have energy, want to pursue something, and don't want to waste time anymore. But pursue what? Nothing that I like gives me that feeling of obsession and enthusiasm I felt when I first started programming. There is nothing I love among the things I like.\n\nMy biggest fear is that this might be my maximum level of internal motivation. Without people pressuring me to do something or teenage hormones that drove me to start programming, this might be my capacity to work on something. I have no limitations in my life right now, and what am I doing now? Scrolling Twitter and reading Reddit posts. Is this where I belong? Is this my natural place to stay when there is no external pressure or sense of obligation? Was everything I have done just the result of the overwhelming self-pressure and fear of missing out, not my genuine desire or motivation? Do I even have such a desire to actually work on anything?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678665228.0},{"title":"Please help me decide what to do in my group therapy tomorrow.","author":"Alternative-Log6663","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pu13z\/please_help_me_decide_what_to_do_in_my_group\/","text":"Brief context: I am in a trauma therapy group and we have started a new phase where each week one person sits in the middle with one of two therapists, and talks about a difficult experience from their life.

First time posting, why not make it in regard to some serious life advice! Thanks in advance to anyone willing to answer.\n\nSome background: I graduated with a master\u2019s degree about five years ago, and am just starting to develop my career. I currently work for a medium-large nonprofit in the US, managing a subregion for a direct service program that is spread over a good chunk of the state. I have been there for going on five years now, and due to some staffing changes am the most experienced staff member (a contractor has been there fifteen). I work in a pretty technical field so it takes time to build expertise, and I\u2019ve also designed a great deal of the systems that we use day-to-day. On top of this, I\u2019m a union member and have seniority over my coworkers in the program, and several outside of it. We are also grant funded and have at least a couple years of funding lined up. In short, I have a few buffers in the event of shit hitting the fan.\n\nNow, I had been relatively content at this job, hours are shit in our busy season but I work with a great group of people, and my boss was the bees knees. Unfortunately, last year amid some cultural changes at our organization my boss found a new position, and the poor culture along with a fuck ton more work made its way to my doorstep. In short, I like my coworkers, strongly dislike my supervisor, and feel that our HR person doesn\u2019t give a fuck about employees and the organization as a whole is more unfriendly towards workers. Because of this, and the intense busy season I want to leave. \n\nI don\u2019t have any specific position lined up, but have a couple promising irons in the fire. I\u2019m not in a position financially to leave without a job lined up, and things aren\u2019t bad enough to necessitate it. I\u2019m not too concerned about hating the new job or getting into a position with a bad culture. My primary concerns with this transition is an abrupt tanking of the economy (maybe fallout from SVB) or organization which I may have been temporarily insulated from at my current job, but will be the new guy with questionable funding anywhere I go. My wife\u2019s employer is pretty reliant on economic development happening, and we don\u2019t have much in savings (working on that) to protect from both of us losing our jobs.\n\nSo to the question\/advice piece: I was wondering what the people of reddit\u2019s experience has been in a similarly volatile position. Maybe from the great recession or a sudden change in a company\u2019s fortune. Did you make a similar change you came to regret due to a sudden economic\/financial calamity, were you able to bounce back relatively quickly, or has it indelibly impacted your life? Are there other things I should be considering as I think about a move? What would you do in a similar position?\n\nTL\/DR: Young professional looking for a new job, concerned about possible economic instability after transition resulting in firing that I\u2019d have been insulated from, and wondering what people\u2019s experiences have been.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678665091.0},{"title":"Advice to you: Add salt and cinnamon to your ice cream!","author":"CapInternal6661","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11ptz73\/advice_to_you_add_salt_and_cinnamon_to_your_ice\/","text":"Any flavor!

We met through a mutual friend who informed me he was gay. I know he's dated women in the past, but I was under the presumption that he discovered he only liked men (turns out this may have been a false presumption). This man is ridiculously attractive and he has many qualities that I would like to see in a partner, although I never thought of him romantically because I thought he was exclusively attracted to men. \n\nA few nights ago I went over to his apartment for a movie night and he was being more \"touchy\" than usual (hugging a lot, leaning up against me, etc.,). This still felt like normal behavior and I was completely comfortable with it. After the movie, we went to a party. I didn't drink at all, but he downed a few. After that, he was becoming even more touchy with me (hugging for LONG periods of time, holding my hand, hugging me from behind, etc). I was still comfortable with this and thought it was him being himself but drunk. \n\nAt one point we were sitting together in a loud, dim room and he looked at me and said he had a crush on me. I thought he was jokingly flirting, as we tend to do so quite a bit, so I said \"I have a crush on you too!\" He stared at more for a while and said \"No, like I really have a crush on you.\" I continued to be playful back, as I assumed we were joking around. He pulled out his phone and opened a conversation with one of his life-long best friends. He scrolled through it, stopping at a conversation they had just before the party. He texted her something along the lines of \"I have a crush on a girl. Her name's (My Name). She's very cute.\" The conversation went back and forth between his friend asking questions about me and him answering. At this point, I was extremely flattered but also really fucking confused. One of the later messages he sent read something along the lines of \"I'd never fuck her but...\" Reading this definitely made me a bit uncomfortable. After reading their conversation, I looked back at him not knowing what to do or say. He was staring back at me with such intensity and desperation. No one has ever looked at me like that before and I wanted to die. He was still being quite touchy throughout the rest of the night (which I didn't mind) and he drunkenly made a few flattering statements to me. \n\nAnd now, I simply don't know what to do. We haven't talked much since then (other than the typical boring conversation about our day). Does he remember showing me those messages? I wanted to convince myself he was just drunk and didn't mean it but those were sober messages. We are extremely close friends and I feel as this is definitely going to change our friendship dynamic. Should I bring this up to him and ask him about it? Is he discovering a new part of himself? Like I said, he is incredibly gorgeous and I have told him I would 1000% date him if he were attracted to woman. But now that it may be a possibility I don't know if I meant that. I also feel as though this is him discovering new parts of himself and I don't want to be his experiment.

I won't say the countries we are from but I will say I live in Europe and he lives in South America. \nI haven't told my parents I am in a relationship with him as my parents are very protective and I already know all their concerns about my boyfriend, like what if he is using the loverboy technique on me? What if he is actually an old man pretending to be a young guy? \nI am a very careful and cautious person. More than anyone I've ever known. I wouldn't do anything stupid without thinking it over 100 times. I've stayed on the phone with him for 7+ hours at a time almost daily since we met.

This is the second relationship I have been in (last one was when i was 14 and in HS), and I genuinely love my partner so much. Him (19M) and I are so deeply compatible, our relationship is filled with lots of healthy communication and laughter, and I adore the fact that we feel so comfortable being ourselves around each other. We're a Tinder match gone right. Being in a relationship is something I have always wanted, and though I acknowledge that being with a man is not what is going to complete my life, this kind of relationship we have is something I have always wanted.\n\nUnfortunately, I really do struggle with anxiety and OCD. I was diagnosed with anxiety\/depression when I was in 8th grade, and I have been on three different medications (Prozac, Zoloft, and now Cymbalta). Though I currently have a prescription, I haven't been taking it recently because I honestly don't support the idea of taking pharmaceuticals. I have found weed to help, it makes me really simmer in my emotions and opens new doors for my thought process. I have had a lot more \"I'm going to be okay\" thoughts when high than I have when popping a pill. As I got older, OCD symptoms really started to flourish in me around 17. I would have to do things in increments of three or I was convinced that something bad was going to be happen to me or a loved one. 17 is when I got my car and my license, and then false memory OCD started really come through. If I was driving my car and I heard a sound, I would automatically assume that I hit someone\/something or killed someone\/something...and didn't remember it. This was hell for me. There was one instance where I was driving home from work, it wasn't dark out, it was literally a three minute drive down the street, and I heard a noise while driving. I was so panicked that when I got home I sat by the window expecting the police to show up to arrest me for a hit and run. There have been times where I would drive around the same spot in loops to double check and make sure that whatever I heard was a noise and nothing more than that to prove to myself I didn't hit or kill anyone because my brain told me I did and didn't remember it. These are examples to really help you understand the situation I will now explain about my relationship.\n\nI am not a disloyal person. Loyalty is a very important trait for me, and it is something I feel like I do a very good job of doing. I'm the type of friend where I will despise someone my friend doesn't like even if I don't know the person. It is a priority to me to show those I love and care for that I am there for them in my entirety. In the beginning of my relationship I went on a family trip without my partner outside the US and on that trip I was drinking. I don't drink frequently, and I prefer weed over alcohol any day. Alcohol for me is a special occasion thing, therefore I drank on this trip as celebration of my birthday. This trip had a lot of nothing to it, just lounging by the pool, walking the beach, and eating amazing food the resort had to offer. The first day of the trip (more like evening since we arrived around 3pm) was just sitting by the view with nice cocktails, dinner, and going to bed. Throughout that, as well as throughout the rest of the trip, I very frequently spoke with my boyfriend on the phone. The first night, after going to bed, I woke up in the middle of the night due to an earthquake and I had a thought \"What if I was so drunk last night that I did something with someone and I don't remember it\". And thats when I started spiraling. I was texting with my friends about it and they all assured me that there is no way that could have happened, and one of my friends even reminded me of the fact that if I was drunk to the point of memory loss, that means the situation would be sexual assault and not cheating. Then I was freaking out that I was sexually assaulted, didn't remember it, and that my boyfriend wouldn't believe me. This was a lot for me and I was losing my mind. I dwelled on this just about every day for 5 months. I spoke to my boyfriend about it, and he was so understanding and gentle and loving. He reassured me that he trusts me and that I'm okay, and that if it did happen it would be an assault and that I didn't purposefully be unfaithful. I've talked about this anxiety with my partner, my friends, and my therapist. My therapist helped break down my Attachment Style (Anxious Attachment) and I was able to feel a lot more at peace of the situation. I remember that trip and I didn't talk to any men or anything like that because things like that are not of interest to me when I have a boyfriend.\n\nBut then.. Now I'm having more anxiety about the same thing in different fonts. I don't have any social media. My contacts are just my friends and important numbers I need to have like family, my dogs groomers etc. I deleted numbers of past flings and the only men in my life other than my boyfriend are my gay besties and two other guys I met my first year of college who are like brothers to me (I even set one up with his now current girlfriend), and my boyfriend has met them and really likes them. I was on my phone the other day and all of a sudden I had this thought..\"What if you just did something unfaithful\" and don't remember it. But its like..what could I have done? There's nothing I could have done or would have done that was disloyal because that is NOT like me.\n\nSo why do I keep having these thoughts??\n\nI don't know if its because I'm finally in a relationship that is happy and healthy and its not something I'm used to so I keep having thoughts that could ruin it or what, but I'm so over it,\n\nI'm really in love with him, he's my best friend. I would never intentionally hurt him. In the beginning of our relationship we were having a lot of problems, and I talked shit about him to my friends. But when things got better, I took the step to tell him about what I said about him to my friends and apologized for my behavior. So being a cheater is not something in my character. Like shit, I have a personal rule I established for myself that if I'm going to have sex with anyone, they need to prove negative STI results, like my current boyfriend and I did to one another when I lost my virginity to him. I don't even like touch or intimacy unless I first really get a feel for someone, so all of these thoughts of me being disloyal or unfaithful and not remembering it just doesn't make any sense, yet I continue to have them! I'll be doing nothing and then these thoughts will come into my head, or if he does something kind for me I'll think to myself that I don't deserve it because theres a chance I cheated but don't remember it.\n\nIf you read all of this, thank you so much for taking the time to do so and I would really appreciate your help with this. I love my boyfriend, I love my relationship, but I do not love these thoughts I am having.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678663440.0},{"title":"I just want some Advice about my Nationality.","author":"Elegant-Lettuce-5405","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11ptbwv\/i_just_want_some_advice_about_my_nationality\/","text":"I just gotta lay it down quickly.

At 7 years old she told me that our mother got pregnant with me as an accident so I was a mistake. At 12 years old, she stopped talking to me despite us living in the same home. So until I get was 18, my home life with her was a living hell. \n\nShe would throw out my dinner at times, leave me stranded out of the house for hours when I had forgotten my house keys, tell me I was worthless, humiliate me in front of my friends, mock me, call me obscene profanities, hide my things. She would judge every single action I would take and use it against me. She would reject and hate on me every single day. \nThe abuse got so bad that I spent every evening when I came home from school locked in my room just to avoid the abuse. \n\nMy parents knew she was mistreating me, and did nothing to stop it.

We were talking a lot, stayed up at night to chat, and met up once to hangout, have coffee, and then hookup. We both went into it expecting nothing more than casual, but when we met up I felt chemistry. He was acting way more publically affectionate than I expected him to. I started fantasizing about and obsessing over him. \n\nBut, it gets a bit more complicated. We got into a fight because he invited me out one time unsure if he'd be able to make it, so we agreed that he'd text me to confirm, and then he didn't do that. He messaged me eventually hours later, panicked, and chalked it up to sleeping in. I didn't believe it because he posted a story with one of his buddies a few hours before. And really, all I wanted is a 'can't make it' text. I didn't care about him cancelling but I did care about him not communicating, probably lying to me, and having no regard for my time. \n\nWe talked through my frustrations and he took the blame well and apologized. I didn't bring up the thing with his friend as I thought that might've been a step too far and wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. \n\nEventually, it got to a point where he asked me why I'm still talking to him if none of what he's saying is making this better and I'm as mad as I am, and that's when I said that I really like him, and when he asked me if I like him as more than a friend, I said I don't know. And that was true, I didn't. Sure, I felt a rush around him and butterflies, but it couldn't be love, that'd be too soon. It could easily be lust or anxiety. A crush at most, but I didn't want to lead him on while I was still figuring it out. \n\nI don't know if he got the right idea, because he kept asking me if I hated him or had conflicted feelings. Eventually we both settled on taking a break from hooking up and chatting for 'a bit', whatever that means. We haven't talked in a little over 2 weeks now. \n\nNow he has his graduation showcase in about a week that he keeps posting on his socials. I thought about going, but I wasn't sure if that'd be crossing any boundaries or seem too desperate. I wasn't thinking of approaching him to talk, but just to attend to be there for something that I know is special and important to him.\nAlternatively, I was thinking of messaging him the morning after and asking how it went. \n\nI'm really just not sure about this whole situation. He's given me mixed signals. He's pursued me for years, and now he's hot then cold. He's said he was just looking for casual but his actions and words for a while showed otherwise. Maybe it's because I made it clear when we first started talking that I'm not ready or looking for a relationship. And though I'm still unclear on where I stand with him, I know there's feelings there that I feel an urge to pursue. \n\nSo my question is whether it is too soon to try and reconnect, and what the best way to go about it would be. I miss our conversations and just want to see where our chats go, no expectations for anything. \n\nAdvice? Suggestions?

The last time I saw her was New Year\u2019s, so it hasn\u2019t been too long\u2026 I just saw a picture of her (taken today) in our family group chat, and she looks dangerously thin. I reached out to my sister-in-law, Melanie, who was in the photo with her, and asked if she really looked that thin, or if it was just the camera angle. She responded saying that she was really that thin and that my brother Aidan- her husband- told her she \u201clooked sick,\u201d and she brushed it off and laughed. \n\nApparently she and my brother-in-law Geoff are dieting together. Geoff is a burly and tall dude, and has lost 30 pounds. I don\u2019t know his previous weight but I have to guess it was over 200 just based on height and appearance. My mom was probably <150 the last I remember, and she\u2019s said she\u2019s lost 45 pounds\u2026\n\nI\u2019m really worried about her. She looks legitimately frail in this photo. I know my mom has suffered with issues with weight all her life. She\u2019s had multiple weight loss procedures\/surgery, and in 2019, she got a gastric-something to help her lose weight again. She had anorexia and bulemia as a teenager for sure, and her mom\/my grandma has some messed up views on weight that have definitely been passed down to my mom and to me, frankly. My mom has tried every fad diet out there: Atkins, keto, brightline, intermittent fasting, hour of power, etc. Currently she\u2019s doing a low-carb thing and mentioned to me on the phone a few days prior that all she had eaten that day was 3 deviled egg halves and a piece of bacon.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to say to her, if anything at all. We have a complicated relationship, and part of our problems together have been weight associated, like she would put me on diets when I was 14 or 15 and weighing only 120 pounds, or encouraging me when I\u2019d say I wanted to be 110 pounds, or warning me I\u2019d get fat every time I ate something like ice cream or cookies or pie. \n\nThe other part of it is that I\u2019m struggling with weight problems of my own. I\u2019m 25, 5\u2019 2\u201d and 225 pounds. I\u2019m trying to do it the right way, I see a licensed nutritionist regularly, I\u2019m working on the mental illness part of it, trying to work through insecurities about working out. I try to give myself grace because I\u2019ve recovered from two suicide attempts, gotten off medication that messed with my metabolism and cravings for a long time. \n\nI\u2019m worried that if I do approach her, she\u2019ll write me off because I\u2019m fat and haven\u2019t been able to lose much weight in the 3 years that I\u2019ve been heavy. Or that she\u2019ll get defensive and lash out with the same body-insults that I\u2019ve tried to move on from. \n\nBut my mom is only 60 and I\u2019m worried what it will mean for her longevity to keep up with the dieting and malnutrition.

One day I just had the gut feeling that she was up to something and started to suspect she was texting another dude, which I don\u2019t mind in a certain extend if it\u2019s about work. Anyways long story short, I asked her for her phone one day and she didn\u2019t want to give it to me, I went to the bathroom then when I came back I knew she had cleared the messages so she let me go threw her phone, didn\u2019t find anything!! I started to do my investigation and found out about her talking to a supervisor where she works at and the conversation was more than friendly, it wasn\u2019t anything sexual, but the guy was flirting with her and she wasn\u2019t really denying the attention. From the messages I felt like it was a lot of cat and mouse interaction which I feel like it wasn\u2019t serious, but I was also mentioned in the conversation , like her telling him details about our relationship , for example \u201c you have complimented me more than he has the last month\u201d. \nGoing back to the cat and mouse analogy, she did invite her over one day to the house and he asked for the address and I know he was ready but she didn\u2019t go threw with giving him the address and said goodnight, but I felt like when he was pulling away from talking to her she was missing that attention!! That was all going on when she was still with me!!!! By the time I found out about their little friendship, I know that she had ended things with that conversation, she said things like \u201chey I know we are not going to be together, sorry that I won\u2019t be there for you, your a good guy but you need someone better for you\u201d\n\nWhen I told her I knew she was first of all shocked about it because there is no way I would know, but she really seemed to be ashamed and also regretted doing it. She said it was a mistake and that it was a stupid error. \n\nI know it wasn\u2019t anything sexual and they only saw each other at work 3 times barely wouldn\u2019t even talk in person. Also this conversation went on for 3 weeks with the dude. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to get out of this is that, she is begging me to go back with her, she said she would do anything to be with me. She said she would work from home, share her location with me. Let me go threw her phone whenever, but I don\u2019t want someone to be loyal to me because they are scared. BTW if it was anything sexual I wouldn\u2019t even talk to her right now !!!!! \n\nI\u2019m trying to find out if I should even consider going back with and continue our 6 year relationship or call it quits.

Can you give me advice on what to do?","author":"BasicDog5067","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pru5z\/exgf_moving_10_hours_away_in_another_province_and\/","text":"My ex (34F) and me (30M) had a 10 year on and off relationship since we were 23 and 19. We broke up about 8 months ago, and have been living separate for about 6 months now. Our relationship had ups and downs, obviously, but we did share a lot of nice moments together through these years, and are still over all on good terms.  \n\n\nIn the spring of 2021, we had a small dog of a long breed who got hit by a car. We both liked her very much and it was hard to let her go. We were both sad and uncertain if we wanted another one, but we would look every now and then to see what was available. During the summer, I ended up finding this other dog on the internet, a little senior of 14 years old with no teeth and a crumpled ear, that was supposed to be terrible with commands and men. I took the day off and we went to check him out. As soon as we met, I called him over and he came and sat on my feet. He wasn't going to be my running partner, but he was very cute and gentle. Fast forward a few hours later, we're on our way back with our new friend, Mr. W .   \n\n\nSince then, we shared our lives with him. Ex had to travel a lot more than me for work and vacations\/family\/friends, so I ended up spending a whole lot of time with him. It took me a while, but I got him used to my habits and to the house, and when ex would come back she would take more care of him (walks and suchs). We had a lot of fun with Mr W. and he would really love us both in return.   \n\n\nWhile we were together, we would both say that this was my dog, and the other one was more hers, and that if we were to ever break up it would be mine (along with the house, which I kept). When we broke up, I thought I would get both. She insisted that if she could find a place where she could have him, she would like have shared custody.   \n\n\nNow, this was maybe not my wisest move, but she loves him, and takes very good care of him as well. I thought \"Well, this can work. There are no reasons to not let her spend time with him. He loves her too, and it's not that much of a hassle to exchange since we live close by.\" And so we did shared custody, for the last 6 months or so. She still traveled a lot, and so the dog ended up spending way more time at my place than hers (about 2\/3 to 1\/3).   \n\n\nWe had a 2 weeks \/ 2 weeks thing, but I would also take him when she couldn't during that time, and my schedule (evening 4-5 hours usually) just works for having this dog. I trained him for it (he was anxious at first, but now is very good), and so I never really need someone else to take care of him while I work. (It can happen, but rarely ever does.)  \n\n\nNow, she bought a house about 10 hours away from where we live, in another province. She wants to keep doing shared custody, months or so at a time. I thought we would have figured out something in the meantime, and really hoped that she would say \"ok, you can keep Mr.W while I live my new life\", but I guess that was wishful thinking. Every time the topic was brought up, this became a \"we'll talk about it later' thing and I hoped but realistically, she doesn't want to give him up. Fair enough, I mean I don't want to either.   \n\n\nShe says she will have more time, although she doesn't have a job yet there. Her new husband will also be there, working on their house, and they will live in a place where they have a huge outdoor space in a rural area. A bit more dangerous wildlife wise, but still, probably not more than in the city with cars and such. Just different problems. Basically, I think they're looking at a stable-ish life at home (Her and I are both professional artists), and making a family.  \n\n\nI will live at the same place, a small townhouse with a backyard for my furry friend (the reason I chose this house at first), where he has lived most of the past 2 years, doing the same job, and spending time with me mostly during the day, and then resting while I go work at night. We walk maybe a bit less, as I am less outdoorsy, but we walk once a day at least from March to November ( he hates the cold, and we live in the cold during these months), often 2-3 times per day in the summer. This might be a problem with a young dog, but I think it works well as he is now almost 16, and you can tell he is exhausted the next (few?) days if we walk a lot in one day. We also have a ton of toys here and, despite his age, we still learn new tricks together which I haven't really seen on her part.   \n\n\nAFAIK, his needs are met at both places. I think though, it would be better for him to live at one of our places instead of changing environment so much. He is in very good shape for his age, but I think he deserves a nice smooth life with lots of pets and hugs from his friends, and some stability. He is also a good traveler, but you can tell it is a lot for him even for when we would go see our respective families and friends in other cities.   \n\n\nSo... \n\nI don't know what to do, and I need advice. Since we can't seem to decide, I thought maybe we could go to court and have someone decide? She didn't seem thrilled by the idea, but since we can't decide, I don't know what else to do. I really thought we could talk it out, but again, I think that was wishful thinking. If we both feel like we want him and we both agree that he is well taken care of at the other place as well, then I don't know what else to say. He did spend more time with me overall ( like I said, maybe 2\/3 1\/3), and is more used to this environment, but that's kind of my only real plus here.   \n\n\nRight now, she wants to take him for a month and a half to \"see how it goes\", and then give him back for a month or so, then take him again for a few months. To me, this doesn't make sense. He isn't a lamp or some other object that we just move around, but a very nice furry friend that deserves some wonderful last few years. He might be *able* to do the shared custody, but I really don't think this is the best for him.   \n\n\nShould I let him go with her? Should I accept this weird shared custody of no fixed lengths? Should I say no to him moving? Should I try to have us go settle this in court? Should I just say goodbye to my friend and let him move away forever? Do you have other solutions to propose?  \n\n\nI really thought that things would be solved by now. I really don't know, and I'm trying to keep this smooth for everyone involved, but this is really stressing me out and I would like this to get solved.  \n\n\nThank you for reading this far, and hopefully for your advice.  \n\n\nBasicDog5067","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678659806.0},{"title":"How do I [27M] deal with self hatred for my race and gender combo?","author":"DrSeussDeuce","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pm188\/how_do_i_27m_deal_with_self_hatred_for_my_race\/","text":"I hate being a South Asian male.

I'm very comfortable with my sexuality and so is he so i don't think what i'm going to it a strictly \"gay\" experience. I've known lots of straight people who have fallen for someone they just met and seen many of them mess it up by admitting to what they're feeling too early.\n\nI know that he at least feels physically attracted to me seeing he's had his tongue down my throat uncountable times haha and he didn't seem to be against it at all, but then when I brought up the question of \"when do you wanna meet up again\" he answers with the word \"probably\". Even though he did mean to come off in a joke away I can't help but wonder if he was actually thinking something else in his head but didn't want to hurt me. At this point I would just rather he be honest with me before I get too attached because they do say when you know you know if you really have a connection with someone and I was feeling that connection. Whether he was or wasn't I have no idea.\n\nHe's also really bad at replying and I really don't want to double text him so he doesn't think that I'm too interested in him because I obviously don't want to come across as desperate. I guess I just want to know what I should be doing with all this time I have in my day because now I just find myself waiting to hear my phone buzz to check if it's him. I went out with him last night on a kind of date but I don't know if you could call it that because we didn't really go to a bar or to dinner, he just took me back to his apartment which would suggest more of a casual thing although there was some actual interesting conversation too. I'm probably overthinking it all. He was also very late to the bar where we met and didn't proceed to go into but I think I'm putting his tardiness down to the fact that he's not from the same culture as I am and so doesn't have the same ideas about punctuality I guess. Anything except him not really wanting to see me.\n\nWhere do I go from here? I'm obviously trying not to check my phone that's often as I did yesterday but it's so stressful leaving my phone so where thinking that I could miss a text.

The quick version is having my first child, developing an autoimmune disease during postpartum, and leaving my SO of 13 years (and father of my child) as he spiraled into an abusive alcoholic. Of course all of this happened during covid and the strange global events adding their own stresses.\n\nAbout 1 year after my child was born, my brother (34m) starting dating C (28f). Despite living in the same metro area, this brother and I aren\u2019t too close. We both feel a lot of family obligations and general fondness but we don\u2019t just chat especially since we have so little in common outside of family things. Not surprisingly C is very different than me and more like my brother in being very conservative, religious, and traditional. They got married last year and I\u2019m happy for them.\n\nWhen C is around me in social settings but talking to me one on one, she asks deeply personal questions like \u201care you just against marriage and that\u2019s why you haven\u2019t married SO?\u201d (That one was asked while attending a wedding). It\u2019s strange because she never tries generic small talk like chatting about my job, talking about crafting (which is our ONLY mutual interest), or things about my brother. And now that I\u2019m a single mom in these similar situations with her, C will ask like \u201cwhen did your child last see her dad?\u201d \u201cAre you dating at all?\u201d Which are such painful and complicated topics I really only discuss with my closest 2 friends. The last instance of this happened at a wedding last night during which I was already stressed handling being a bridesmaid with my daughter as a flower girl.\n\nAny thoughts on how I can get her to stop asking such probing questions especially at such inappropriate places? \n\nFYI I think part of why I feel awkward about this all is everyone raves how kind C is but my experience of her has always felt awkward and off putting. Usually I just try telling myself she is young and naive, but this has gone on for years now and I\u2019m not wanting it to continue.\n\nPS C has no relevant life experiences, so it isn\u2019t like she can empathize or offer any advice either.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678657808.0},{"title":"Feel lonely but like being alone a lot","author":"notyourbaeboyyy924","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pqu6q\/feel_lonely_but_like_being_alone_a_lot\/","text":"i have like 2 close friends and a bf. other than that, I mostly just have acquaintances and people that I\u2019m friendly with.

Great job, House, new dog, and serious relationship for about 3 years.

My first week or two I received many comments from my bosses about how good of a job I had been doing. Then, on January 14th, I was asked by my supervisor (well call her F) if I had any interest in being promoted to cashier supervisor. I told F I would be interested and if she needed anything information from me to just ask. F also told me that corporate has to approve me to get the job and once they do I can start and she will train me.\n\nAbout a month later, on February 12th, I was told by the women in charge of hiring (well call her C) that when I get back from a 10 day absence I was taking I would begin training for the cashier supervisor position. I would get back on the 24 of February or so.\n\nMy first day back after my absence I did not receive the training. Then the second and third day pass and I still had yet to start the training. I asked C if she knew when I would start and she said I would need to ask F about it. When I asked F about it seemed as if she didn\u2019t know that I was going to be starting, not just this week but in general. She told me that I would be able to start \u201cnot next week but the week after (this would be tomorrow)\u201d and I assumed she was telling me the truth. \n\nFast forward to yesterday. I was talking to one of my other supervisors and she said that F told her I would start my training not tomorrow but the week after (the 20th-24th). \n\nThis is a very brief summary of what has happened thus far.\n\n\nI am not sure what I should do or say at this point. Should I ask F and C about it again? I feel like I am being taken advantage of if don\u2019t ask. I am also worried that if ask they will be annoyed. I am worried that if I don\u2019t keep asking about it then i will always be told it will happen next week.

Luckily I made a little group of friends ranging from 22-30 years old. The best friend I've made here is also a fellow transplant. We talk pretty much everyday. She's smart, she can be funny sometimes, she goes out of her way for me, we have similar worldviews, she's really pretty, we have great conversations, etc. I normally take a long time to like someone, and I've slowly developed feelings for this person. I also think she probably likes me too, but that's besides the point of this post.\n\nShe definitely does some things that set off some alarms in my head. I think they're probably red flags, but I need to be certain so I am consulting my fellow redditors.\n\nThe main thing is **I don't like how tolerant she is of shitty people.** The biggest example I can think of is we used to have this other girl (25F) in our group. Long story short, we ended up exiling her from the group because she basically stalked this guy she dated a bit in a group after he very gently broke up with her for valid and non-personal reasons. I'm talking showing up to his apartment blackout drunk unannounced in the middle of the night banging on the door, sending him insane walls of texts, manipulation, projection, gaslighting, fake crying, etc. Pretty much every toxic trait in the book.\n\nAside from all of the horrible things she did to our friend (22M) (who btw is the nicest guy ever) she's still completely unhinged. She threw a \"going away party\" for herself which was a end up being a complete lie! She just wanted people to hang out with her! **SHE WAS NEVER GOING ANYWHERE**. I also recently found out this person **PRETENDED TO BE DRUNK** one time in hopes I would take her back to my place and sleep with her! I remember being super concerned and spending 20 minutes trying to convince her I could drive her home, before I eventually she called an uber. Not only that, this person has admitted to driving drunk multiple times and doesn't seem to think anything of it.\n\nShe also might be the dumbest person in the history of people. I'm talking like room temperature IQ. I am from Michigan and I sometimes wear a shirt with a simple outline of the state. She asked me once \"where am I from\" even though I had told her 100 times. I point to the shirt and she claims \"she'd never seen that place in her life\". Excuse me, what? It's one of the most recognizable state, and this girl is from the US!! Then she proceeds to apologize and tell me she always gets Chicago and Wisconsin mixed up. Well one of those is a state and the other is a city in a different state and I'M NOT FROM EITHER ONE. Holy fucking SHIT! Oh she also didn't believe me when I told her Egypt was a country, she just thought it was \"made up for movies, and we should be Egyptians for Halloween\". Are you kidding me? You can't dress up as a race of people, wtf.\n\nI have about a million more interactions with her like that, but that's besides the point. I stopped interacting with this person pretty quickly after I learned some of the bad stuff, and cut her off entirely after learning the really bad stuff. My friend (29F) still talks to and interacts with this person and I cannot fathom why. I told her my concerns. She says it's just a \"surface level thing\" and it's \"fun for her\" even though she had made it clear to me she does not care for this person. Ultimately, I am not going to tell anyone who they can and can't hang out with, but I do think it's pretty weird to continue a friendship with a person who did horrible things to our friend and is horrible as an individual.\n\nOn top of that, my friend (29F) is the one who told me most of this stuff, which I find super weird. As far as I know, she didn't call out the other person (25F) on any of it. Which is fine, but I think if you don't want to try and tell this person why what they're doing is messed up, then you just shouldn't engage with them at all. It just gives me a very two-faced vibe. Obviously I am nothing like the other girl (25F) but I can't help but wonder if and what kind stuff she says behind my back, or would say if I our bond ever suffered rather than consulting me about it like adults. It makes me feel like keeping a medium friendship for this person may be for the best.\n\nThis is not the only case of my friend (29F) doing stuff like this, but it's worst one. If I am being honest, I think it's a pretty big red flag. However, I have been told I put too much weight into things and often write people off way sooner than I should.  Which I totally agree with, and I am trying to step back a little bit, because I definitely look for problems that sometimes aren't there. No one is perfect, in fact I would say everyone has some form of \"red flags\".\n\nAn explanation could be she hasn't had a lot of great friends in her life, so maybe this is just what she's used to. I myself have been very lucky with my friends. I have a very solid group of friends back home who I trust completely and I love dearly, and not a lot of people can say that. I don't feel the need to hang out with shitty people because I already have good people I really like I can fill that time with. I do remember however, hanging out with some real jerks (although it was middle school) because I didn't have any other friends at the time. Maybe some people are never lucky enough to get out of that, and even the company of an evil person is preferable to loneliness.\n\nThere's more I could say, but I have gone on long enough. I am mostly wondering if I still even want to pursuing this person, or maybe if should distance myself from her entirely. It sucks because other than this, I really do like her. If you need any more information just ask, thanks.

We\u2019ve known each other through high school, really liked each other, and somehow ended up back together.\n\nI\u2019m newly an ex-Mormon. I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t think the church is true, it\u2019s a cult, and that I don\u2019t believe in Joseph Smith and their prophets. I also believe in the Holy Trinity which goes directly against Mormonism.\n\nMy boyfriend is Christian. He goes to his college church, attends two activities a week on top of that, and is pretty serious about it. His mom is a leader at their church in our hometown. He has one-on-ones with his group leader, and they obviously talk about me because I\u2019m going through a religious journey.\n\nI believe in God and Christ, I pray every day, I believe in the teachings and lessons in the Bible, but I\u2019m not sure if I qualify as a Christian. I\u2019m just very confused about when I\u2019m allowed to call myself thaf because in Mormonism your membership is a title that needs to be earned. \n\nAs I said, my bf has one-on-ones. His leader said he thinks we should break up because this relationship will be a factor in my religion. I should choose God because of me, not because my bf wants that of me.\n\nI get the sentiment, but I just feel like it implies that I haven\u2019t already chosen God. \ud83d\ude05 It feels counterintuitive for the person inspiring me to leave me in order to keep inspiring me. I\u2019ve loved dating him because he\u2019s the first bf I\u2019ve had that didn\u2019t push religion onto me. Mormonism varies from Christianity in lots of ways, but I believed (and still believe) in God. I had a relationship with him before. I was able to take a step away from Mormonism because of my bf. I finally felt safe enough to leave. It\u2019s because of him and his mom that I\u2019m able to explore religion and ask questions. Lots of people date members of a particular church and convert. He\u2019s scared he\u2019s pressuring me into Christianity, and now I feel like I can\u2019t choose God without it being perceived as for him even though I know it isn\u2019t. I felt like his leader and him set me up to appear that way UNLESS we break up. \n\nMy bf doesn\u2019t think we should break up, but obviously anyone you admire telling you that you should is going to mess you up for a bit. \n\nWe talked last night about it and agreed that when I attend his college next year we\u2019d try to go to church together. I want to go to church again and when I\u2019ve visited on weekends, I\u2019ve enjoyed the group he goes to. I didn\u2019t feel stressed going to bed last night, but now I\u2019m all stressed about it again. I just feel like there are a lot of expectations on what I should be doing in terms of my relationship with God, and that\u2019s exactly why I left the Mormon church.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do and it\u2019s been weighing on my mind. He doesn\u2019t know what the right thing to do is because obviously my relationship with God is more important than my relationship with him. I just don\u2019t understand how those things can\u2019t coexist. \n\nBreaking up so I can figure things out is just confusing. I don\u2019t know what there is to figure out. I believe in Christanity\u2019s core principles, it\u2019s just a matter of getting involved. So, the idea of breaking up to fulfill my religious journey is just weird. I feel separated from the get go from other Christians. \n\nI\u2019ve prayed about it and I\u2019m into sure. \n\nI don\u2019t know. What should we do? Is it a good idea to break up?

But throughout 2022, I had mentioned there were issues I was concerned about. Every few months, the doctor DID help me with trying to resolve the issue and on my last appointment of 2022, I was told to come back only if needed. At the end of 2022, I call and let them know the issue still persists but the office wanted to charge me a fee since I just hit the 1yr mark they would offer complimentary visits. I pay the fee.\n\nApt day comes around and I go, doctor makes the adjustment to fix the issue, and I ask the office manager (who is also the treatment coordinator) my questions because I want to be FULLY prepared for all these charges and make sure it makes sense. \n\nThe lady starts getting really defensive and starts speaking to me in a condescending tone and starts telling me that the office is a business and she has to collect the fee (because that\u2019s how they make money, her words). I KINDLY ask if there was any wiggle room in case my teeth needs more time and $80\/visit for an issue that wasn\u2019t resolved after I already paid $6k for was concerning to me. She says nope no other way, (which is fine btw I never pushed for free visits), and then mentions the work the doctor did for me that day SHE would and could charge me hundreds more for and that the doctor was doing me ~a favor~. \n\nShe then told me that I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to see the doctor anymore unless I paid for \u201cactive treatment\u201d all over again ($6k). My only other option was to be DONE and purchase their retainer plan which is just under $1,000 that covers 5 years. \n\nThis is when she says to me \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can pay for anything anyways because you had questions and issues with the office visit fee\u201d.

Honestly I wasn't too keen on ending a friendship I thought was gonna last forever. But\nThe problem is I don't know if it's the right decision. But I just don't know if I could stand being her friend anymore. She had just had her quince which was important to her and I was even one of her damas.\n\nThe problem is her. For starters she just turned 15. Believe it or not she's living with her s\/o. Her mom knows she's living with him. Not to mention he's 17. They've been together since she was 13 and I'm positive they've been having you know for a long time.\n \nPart of the problem is her s\/o. He's really toxic. When they argue he hits her like a grown man. Last time I saw them fight he knocked out her nose ring and made her nose bleed.This was when they had us as company over so you can only imagine how they fight when no one's around. \n\nHowever, she's not afraid to hit him back. So I guess they have somewhat equal fights even though he's much stronger than her. Not to mention he calls me the N word every chance he gets.\nHe knows what it means even thought his English isn't good. She had told him over and over but doesn't try to stop him or correct him. She just acts surprised and laughs it off. Another problem is the last time me and another friend stayed over.\n\nLike I said, he's 17, I am 14. We all had to share their bed which was disgusting but we had no other choice, the arrangement they chose was that I'd be by the wall, he boyfriend would be next to me, she'd be next to him and our friend would by on the other side of the bed.\n\nI wasn't exactly comfortable with this but they didn't really care. All of my friends have considered me the prettiest in all of my friend groups. And knowing that he has cheated on her before and he's showed a little interest in me I knew he would try something.\n\nI was right. While we were all talking together and he could just barely understand us but she would translate for him. Anyways while we were talking I felt his hand in between my thighs slowly traveling up. I kept moving my legs and pushing his hands off. He stopped trying after about 5 times, and I told her he kept touching me.\n\nShe didn't say anything and brushed it off like she didn't hear me. That's only some of the problems of her s\/o but I'm moving on. Now because she stays with her s\/o, she doesn't care to attend school.\nWith how things are going I won't be surprised if she gets pregnant and never goes to college. She's already missed basically the entire school year.\n\n I know it's not really my business but it just shows how she doesn't care about her future.She's a bad influence for me. Everyone says the same. Another thing she's goes out with random guys all the time (who are usually 18-20) and even has me an my other friend go with her sometimes. Sure none of them have tried anything but still. It's dangerous and these men are too old for her.\n\nThey all have cars as well so I guess she just likes when they take us wherever we want and usually buy whatever we want(mostly food) but it still seems stupid to me. We're barely in highschool and she's already ruining her future.\nAnother thing, she always avoids important conversations. Like when I try to talk to her about her boyfriend, the situation she's put herself in, her bad choices, how stupid it is to hangout with grown men, everything really. I just couldn't anymore. There's too much.\n\nShe never listens to anyone and only does what she wants. She said things will change but I don't think it will. I can't be apart of these bad situations anymore. They put me in danger too. I could get in trouble for her.\n\nLike a while back her s\/o was taking us to go swimming but decided he wanted to make some money before we get there unto my knowledge. He decided to make a drug deal. He sold drugs to this guy. I had told them over and over again I didn't want to be there.\n\nIt was at this trailer park. So I was confused when we got there but as soon a they told me I nearly begged to leave. They were saying we were already there. But I kept saying I wanted to leave, I didn't want to be a part of it, I wanted to go straight home, I would literally call immigration on him if he didn't take me back.\n\nwe got to the trailer but stayed in the car while the guy who was buying came to the car and stood in the door. I saw him look at my friend and in Spanish he asked who she was.\nHer s\/o said she was his s\/o. I didn't want to draw any attention to myself so I kept my eyes on my phone unless he wasn't looking at me. He then looked in the backseat at me and said something in Spanish but I couldn't understand.\n\nThe only reason I was somewhat ok that we went there was because I saw this really really fine boy and I wanted to talk to him. We still went to the lake after but I swas still mad. I just can't be apart of this stuff anymore. They can dig their hole as deep as they want but I won't deal with them anymore. Anyways I kinda got off topic.\n\nMy things is am I making the right decision? I mean we've been friends for years, we grew up together but I'm not sure, I told her she was a bad influence and she told me how much she was crying. I stayed despondent and later I got a text from one of our mutual friends. But I only said I'll think about it. The friend said how could I be so cruel and emotionless.\n\nThat I was just throwing away this friendship and how I should give her one more chance.\nWas I wrong for being despondent? Is there a different way I should've went about it? What should I do next?

(yes I sound like a Discord mod, can't wait for hate comments) We've known each other for a while and although I don't know exactly how she looks as we never met in real life, she's very nice to me and tries to cheer me up if she suspects I'm feeling down. I thought for a while that she's a catfish, but my suspection was wrong after the time and heart she puts into our conversations. I had never experienced so much empathy from an (almost anonymous) friend and her gentle and kind nature drove me insane. I really like her a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, she likes another boy who doesn't love her back and ghosts her. She's been sad for a month and told me that's why she's been in such a bad mood lately. I want to help her get over it, but at the same time I'm in a constant mood because she keeps reminding me how much I like her and that there may be times we'll never get together since it was always like that in the past. (I often think about us too and I can't turn it off, it's been part of my nature for as long as I can remember)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I'm thinking about leaving her because she'll probably have to deal with it herself, because as a friend I can't do much. But I don't want to break off contact with her because I don't want to do the same thing to her again and we already had a small argument about it, because at some point the feelings boiled over and I blocked them. If I hadn't stayed in the discord server where I met her, all contact would have been cut off. She didn't like that and said she would like to keep in touch with me.

He treats her so badly she litteraly calls herself a crybaby and cries after him and then has negative things about her crush in her status. I'm very confused by this and have no idea if it's worth continuing on the emotional rollercoaster now or just finishing it off and leaving her and making sure she keeps crying for at least a week... .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis situation is like a double-edged sword:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption 1:\n\nIf I take the chance and stay with her, I can help her and we both could get together which is a win-win then, BUT I've been through hell of emotions up until then and my already broken psyche and the uncertainty is bothering me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption 2:\n\nIf I don't do it and then another 5 to 6 years pass before the next chance for a relationship arises, I will probably still regret it and then I will act prematurely again based on my mistakes, which could ruin the situation again. What I want to mention about the second option, even if it doesn't sound bad and I'm just exaggerating, I know myself very well and I know that after that I'm not looking for friendships (like now) and I'm looking for a relationship again , since for me it is the only meaning in life at the moment.

I picked her up and took her to A&E. The doctor who seen us didn\u2019t actually look at my daughters shoulder, she was wearing a T-shirt, a school shirt and a blazer and none of them were asked to be removed and her actual skin was never seen by this doctor. The doctor did feel her fingers and said that she had a pulse in her hand (her hand had gone numb). They sent her for an X-ray and the doctor said that her shoulder wasn\u2019t dislocated and her hand was numb because she had anxiety(?!). When we left I was not happy so I took her to an urgent care centre who took one look at her and said that her shoulder was very clearly dislocated and sent us to another A&E department. They rang ahead and the orthopaedic team were waiting for her. \n\nShe was kept in the hospital that night because her shoulder would not go back in. Many doctors and nurses tried and when it was put in place it was just immediately coming straight back out. She was diagnosed with hyper mobility. The next morning (Tuesday) she was seen by an orthopaedic consultant who said that he thinks the problem is that she\u2019s had hypermobility all this time and because the joint has been moving in and out over her life it\u2019s now at a point where the muscles and ligaments would not hold it in place because they were too damaged. They brought up a physio therapist but she said that my daughter needed to be seen by a specialist and she would put a referral in and she would be seen urgently by Friday. \n\nWe got home at 11pm Tuesday night. While In the hospital my daughter was given Entonox, paracetamol, ibuprofen, and Orpmoroh because she was obviously in agony with the shoulder. She was not given any medication to take home. When she woke up on Wednesday morning her had completely lost the use of her hand and the numbness had travelled to her arm. I called the number for the socialist Physio she was supposed to be seeing before Friday, and they said that they couldn\u2019t see her till next Wednesday. So I took her back to the original A&E (as this is our closest hospital) and they basically said that there was nothing they could do until she had seen the physio and that losing the use of her hand was just unfortunate. I was quite frustrated as she was in agony to the point where she couldn\u2019t even sit and watch Tv because of the pain, so i asked if they could give her something to help the pain. They weren\u2019t going to but eventually decided to give her some diazepam in the hospital in the hope that it would relax the muscle and that would help with the pain, but would not let her take any home. It did seem to help but she was still in considerable pain. \n\nOn the Thursday she accidentally fell up the stairs and knocked her shoulder and it moved from hanging downwards, to sitting backward and the pain was so much worse. So I took her back to A&E and was pretty much told that I shouldn\u2019t have and we just needed to wait till Wednesday. They acknowledged that he shoulder was still dislocated and wouldn\u2019t relocate. \n\nI took her to the specialist appointment on Wednesday and when we got there she had been referred to the wrong department and the appointment was for adult physio not childrens physio so no one would see her. We were told that another referral would be made and that we would need to wait up to 4 weeks for another appointment. I expressed how this made me extremely concerned as she was in agony, missing school and every day her arm and hand are more and more swollen but I was just told she has to wait. \n\nShe still has a dislocated shoulder and it hasn\u2019t been back in joint at all since last Monday. I feel like I am desperately trying to get someone to help her but we just keep being told to wait. But the longer it is like this the worse it\u2019s getting for her and it\u2019s so horrible seeing her so distressed. The last time I took her to A&E a paediatric nurse said that I was \u2018showing red flags\u2019 by constantly taking her to the hospital as we\u2019ve been told nothing can be done, I explained to her that the advice I was given was \u2018if anything changes or gets worse being her back to the hospital\u2019 so that\u2019s what I was doing. She said that she knew that but as a paediatric nurse she has to look out for warning signs. I explained that I have a Social Work degree, am Safeguarding Adult and Child level 3 trained, and I deal with serious safeguarding risks in my profession every day. I said that if she felt the need to complete a safe guarding form and put in a referral I would even sign it for her because her accusation was ridiculous. My daughter has a very clear Injury and it\u2019s not the case that I\u2019m trying to convince people she\u2019s unwell, there are 3 X-rays showing a dislocated shoulder and my daughter is the proof. The nurse said that this wasn\u2019t necessary but it\u2019s now made me hesitant to take her back to A&E. Her whole hand is now blue and her arm is again swollen. \n\nIs there anything else I can do to try and get someone to take seriously how much pain she is in. Is it reasonable that she has just been left with a dislocated shoulder and no use of her hand for over a week. Am I wrong in thinking more should have been done? I would really appreciate any opinions.

She\u2019s in 5th grade now. We haven\u2019t had any major issues until now. The school has a GATE program and a dual immersion Spanish program. I tried to get her into both programs but wasn\u2019t successful. My kid meets standards, isn\u2019t disruptive, just generally a decent kid, so I never hear from the school except at conference time. This year her academics still look good but she\u2019s been really stressed and she\u2019s gotten sick more often. She\u2019s the kind of kid who feels physically bad when she\u2019s stressed, and will throw up if she feels too nervous. Turns out that eight out of the thirty kids in her class have a pattern of verbally or physically disruptive behavior. There are two 5th grade classes at the school. The other class hasn\u2019t had any ongoing behavioral issues. The reason (I believe) is because rather than split up the students with behavioral problems, the school made the other class into a GATE\/accelerated class. My daughter\u2019s class is the dumping ground for everyone else, and it\u2019s really gotten to her and affected her self-esteem. The administrative staff at our school has always been unapproachable, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do much if anything. I want my kid (and all the other kids in that class) to have the same opportunities as the kids in the other 5th grade class. We can\u2019t change schools or swap classes at this point but I think that her school should offer some kind of reparation such as tutoring or some kind of activity or therapy. Worst case they could let me pull my kid out for the rest of the year. How do I get results from the staff? I feel like I\u2019ve been stonewalled because I don\u2019t know which buttons to push.

I've been friends with my friend since middle school and he's my most consistent and longest standing friend. He's cheated at least 4 times that I know of and likely more.

They're really toxic and have been on and off for years. I know she's left him and been with other guys while he begged for her. He always uses that as an excuse for why he does what he does which I know doesn't excuse him. I know she is feeling conflicted because she gets upset at him all the time.

So back in summer 2021, a teacher of mine who I had known for years passed away at a young age unexpectedly. As a PE teacher, she had worked in my primary school and was occasionally teaching at my secondary school. In December, there was an assembly happening in the primary school in memory of this teacher where all her family would be there. While preparing for this event, my secondary school vice principal was looking for members of my class who knew her to attend this assembly\/say a few words. Since I wanted to be involved in any events related to this teacher, I put my hand up to volunteer along with other classmates. It was only when I got home, I thought to myself 'What was I thinking, I can't go to this'. So I didn't. The day of the event came and I went to class instead.\n\nI had definitely made the right choice because if I went, I only would have made things worse, probably would have cried and embarrassed myself. But, I don't remember if I told my vice principal that I couldn't go anymore. I know this was a really crappy thing to do. I've since graduated from school, but I can't get rid of the guilt for not telling my vice principal, as it was rude not to inform her that I wouldn\u2019t be there.

I had a friend with benefits for almost three years. We had a nice time together and everything was fine. Last year, after one night together, I discovered that I was pregnant. I told him. He immediately said that he doesn\u2019t want to be a father and that the best option for the both of us was to make a abortion. \nI wasn\u2019t sure about what I wanted. All my life I dreamed about being a mom and having a family. \nWhile living this situation we got closer and I started to develop feelings about him. I was pregnant and in love. Things got really confused because he was really unhappy with the situation and I felt so bad because I didn\u2019t know if I want to make a abortion. I was feeling pressure to decided and I really think he was staying with me, acting like he had feelings for me and wanted us to build a relationship just to use my feelings as a form to get me to get the abortion. \nI didn\u2019t believe his words, that everything will be fine and I was constantly feeling that I was putting his priorities and needs before mine own. I didn\u2019t felt respect or loved. I spend so many days crying and alone because he was with his friends in parties and I didn\u2019t had energy to go out and live my life normally. \nI also didn\u2019t tell my family and friends about nothing that was happening. He was the only person I could talk to. \nSo, I felt like I was in such a complicated situation. Because my health was also being compromised in the middle. Physic and mentally.\nHe always told me that he will help with everything I needed if I made the abortion, but when I asked \u201cwhat will be your attitude if I decided not to abort?\u201d He never knew what to answer. \nMy first decision was to hide everything from him. I told him that I made the abortion and everything was over. But I was so overwhelmed and in one day we were fighting and I told him that I had lied. He was furious. He offend me, said that he was never going to be a father to my child, said horrible things\u2026 I was so broken. I\u2019m still broken. Because the pressure was even bigger. He was always saying that I needed to end this problem that if I didn\u2019t get the abortion I was going to ruined his life and mine. \nSo I decided to lie again. I decided to told him that I get the abortion, he asked for proves so I change the result in one old lab test\u2026 I\u2019m not proud of what I did. But in my head I could give this baby for adoption and she or him have a beautiful and lovely life or keep the baby like I always deep down felt was the right thing to do. I was putting my body and my choices in the trash because of someone else\u2019s opinion. He never cared about what I wanted or about what I really was feeling. Everything I asked him for he told me to wait or that was not the right time. I was considering doing this really big thing for his happiness and he even was capable to love or respect me like was supposed to. We had good times in the middle of this but deep in my heart I was feeling something was missing or wrong. I wasn\u2019t really happy. \nToday, I\u2019m seven months pregnant and NOBODY knows. He broke up with me a few weeks ago because he had one birthday dinner and he said I could go with him and his ex also were going to this birthday. He never introduced me to his parents or friends, our relationship were based in my house, like only exists in four walls. He never told anyone about me, about us. \nI\u2019m feeling very lonely without someone to talk to, to share my feelings, my doubts, my problems\u2026 all this hormones and being almost nine months isn\u2019t nothing easy physically. \nI\u2019m considering to tell him the truth, because I\u2019m almost without forces\u2026 and before all this he was my best friend, the first person I confided everything, but I know he will be so angry and never forgive me. \nWhat should I do?

I'm a 20 year old (M) college student who used to work with a much older woman (35F). I always found her attractive. In my eyes she was the the prettiest woman I've ever seen in my life (she actually looked much younger than her age).\n\nAnyways we started talking at work and we had chemistry. We pretty much liked the same things and we had great conversations. As  time went on and on, things got more intimidating. She started starring at me in a very intimadating way. She also started texting me daily and consistently. I knew that she was in a relationship with another guy and i just thought she was just being friendly.\n\nBut one day, she told me to hang out after work together. And we did. I had an amazing time with her. I honestly haven't met anyone that interesting in my life. As i was walking her home, she caught me off guard and kissed me. It was the sweetest kiss I've had ever experienced. I told her i liked her a lot and so did she. I always had in my mind that i shouldn't get into other people's relationship and i genuinely felt bad about her boyfriend. But i couldn't resist to her, it was magical. \n\nWe worked for 3 months together (basically all summer). This was honestly the best time of my life. We started dating somehow. (we kept it between us, but we started seeing each other a lot). She's the most amazing woman I've ever met, idk if her age makes me think of that. Maybe it's her maturity Thad made me fell so hard for her? I'm not sure. Anyway, the thing after summer was over, i left the job, because of college. And after this happened she somehow disappeared. She suddenly started texting me rarely and she was cold, but nothing had happened between us. I kept texting her and asking about how she was, but after some time she ghosted me.\n\nIt's been half a year since we texted each other. I honestly can't stop thinking of her. She's been living in my head 24\/7, i can't concentrate on anything and most importantly in my studies. I just think of her and cry, i can't even listen to music anymore, because we had the same taste and the songs remind of her, why did she do that to me? Why she initiated the whole thing if she's was going to do that without explain anything to me. She promised me that she would keep in touch with me no matter what. And i believed her. I know the age gap is huge, but i didn't mind, that's what she said as well. I feel like i was being used.  \n\nI also bear in mind that she was cheating on her boyfriend, and i don't know if i would like to be with someone who's a cheater. I just feel so depressed and don't know how to get over her. I know some of you might say you can find other people as well, but i literally had one gorgeous girl asking me to have sex with her and i declined, because while she was talking with me, i was only thinking about her. It feels like I've developed an obsession with her and it's unhealthy. I've been with other women before, but this just felt so special to me, i can't really explain it. I feel so blank. I've been waiting for a text from her every single day, and the urge of texting her is huge, idk if she's gonna reply or not. did she just play me? I just crave of seeing her just one more time. She stigmatized me. Every other girl i meet, i subconsciously compare her to her and she's always better. I can't feel anything for other girls and it's been a long time. I'm so embarrassed of going to therapy because a woman 15 years older played me like that. \n\nTL;DR i had an affair with a much older co-worker, and when she left the job she stopped texting to me, but i can't get over her.\n\nPS: excuse me for my English, im Argentinian.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678650410.0},{"title":"My depressed friend is slowly letting himself turn into a literal zombie.","author":"The_Dukes_Of_Hazzard","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pntgn\/my_depressed_friend_is_slowly_letting_himself\/","text":"Basically I go to school with him and here are a few things I\u2019m worried about for him\n\n1.\tHe has been wearing the same pants for the entire year (unwashed)\n2.\tHe has been doing the same thing with shirts as far as I know\n3.\tHE HAS BEEN WEARING THE SAME SOCKS for the past four months (also unwashed and they have lots of holes, he wears sandals so that\u2019s how I know\n4.\this teeth are yellow as the sun and have layers and layers of grime and plaque on them\n5.\this hair is so oily he could stay afloat\n\n\nI know I should let people look how they want to look, but he has told me he is as of late very depressed (past year or so) and I\u2019m just worried he could be doing serious damage to himself in the long run.

I'm sorry if this gets all over the place and long, it's been a year in the making. Almost exactly a year ago I got fired from a job I was excelling in quickly, I got tips every night, one time I got tipped $85 for two events I hosted. Here's some background, I (16f) at the time had just landed a job that I loved, even though it came with its drama, I was working with my ex, Jack (19m), (we broke up two years prior after a short relationship, ended mutually) my boyfriend at the time (we'll call him Z) and his girlfriend at the time didn't like it, she even came to our work one night to try and fight me, there was a scandal between a manager and worker, people got into fights, drunk people, you get the point. I should also mention that Jack was promoted to supervisor after the manager scandal\n\nWe had just hired a new girl, Donna (16f), my first impression was that she was a bitch, and she would hang all over Jack and refused to ask anybody else for help. Eventually she branched off of Jack and onto Seth (18m) we all became friend and would hang out after work. I broke up with Z and got with Jack, and the four of us would hang out all the time. Because of events that happened with Z I felt like I couldn't talk to Jack about my feelings so I would talk to Seth. Seth and Donna got into a relationship and we would double date, then she decided she didn't like Seth and I being friends and caused a whole bunch of drama and created lies to get me fired. I got fired and refused to go back there to be with friends for a couple months. I eventually went back to be with friends and Jack, and Donna and Seth were at the counter, Jack had just gotten off work and came over to be with us. Donna refused to serve us and wouldn't let Seth serve us, Jack got fed up and did it himself. \n\nRecently I found out Seth and Donna broke up around Christmas, Seth and I got back into contact and I found out that Donna moved out of her moms house and into her dad's. Donna's mom came to my new work and I tried to avoid her because I didn't know what to expect, but she recognized me and then called Donna a bunch of names, then she texted me that night to ask what actually happened at my old job and we have been in contact ever since. She asks me questions and I answer or she just wants to talk. Today Donna called me on my number after a year since I got fired and was screaming and yelling at me to stop talking to her mom and stop telling lies, and stop taunting her, I don't know how I'm taunting her, I made her even more mad and hung up on her and blocked her number, why she still had my number I have no clue. Then Jack called me saying Donna called him to complain about me, as soon has he heard her name he hung up on her and blocked her number. Jack and I are now 21 and 18, we have been together for over a year and a half, and just recently got engaged, we don't want to be in the drama and before I get told to stop texting her mom, I try to, but several weeks later she would text me again, when I texted her today was the second time I texted her first.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678649274.0},{"title":"what\u2019s happening to me..?","author":"shingaling40hours","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pnbnm\/whats_happening_to_me\/","text":"I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t experience problems atm, but I find myself crying for simple to no reason for a few seconds, then acting as if nothing happened, then I cry again..and act as if nothing happened...then feel enthusiastic at some point in the same day.

In retrospect, he was controlling and manipulative person, not to say I was a saint but it was a whole other messy thing don\u2019t want to get into.\n\nThen, there\u2019s my friend (X). Similarly, he had fallen for a girl and got broken up with abruptly.

We were friends before all this and I\u2019ve only ever saw him as a friend but after all the talks I suddenly saw him in a different more vulnerable light I\u2019ve never seen before. Then, he asked me out to a meal (just the two of us) as he had a coupon he wanted to use with X but couldn\u2019t. I agreed to meet up with him and I felt something change.

I'm hesitant to launch into a conversation about it with them because of the way they behave when they're upset and I'm also wary of reinforcing their point of view, but it's also causing me a level of anxiety which is affecting my every day life. I'm wondering if anybody has experienced this sort of thing and if they have any tips or angles to come at it from which could help us see eye to eye. I'm very nonconfrontational and they are very confrontational, but I think they probably see it like I always just accept when they are right.\n\nWe have a group of friends which started talking a lot more in a group chat since the pandemic - there is usually activity on it every day. Several times a week we go on discord and play games and a couple of times a year we all meet up. Over the last couple of years there's been a few times where the person I'm asking for advice about (person A) along with another member of the group (person B) have been upset about me hanging out with a third member (person C). \n\nThe first time was about two years ago, I went to visit person C after we had organised to meet as a group and postponed the plan. At the reorganised group meetup a few weeks later it naturally came up that I had been, and A and B were shocked and said it was weird that we'd do it secretly. I was confused and a little offended because it didn't really make sense that I would tell them about it afterwards if it was meant to be secret. Person A said they had booked time off work for the original plan and was annoyed that it was wasted. \n\nThe second time was a few months ago and myself and person C had gone to see a band. Very late in the evening A and B messaged on the group chat to suggest we play games, and we didn't respond because we were out. The next morning I replied to explain we had been at the show - to which A and B reacted very angrily about, person A especially. They accused us of repeatedly meeting up without them and only revealing after the event, which they said was weird and clearly deliberate. They agreed that it was a genre of music they repeatedly make fun of us for liking and had no interest in having been invited. When we said that we just hadn't thought to mention it we were accused of being liars because they thought it was impossible that we wouldn't have mentioned the plan as we talk every day. This went on for almost an entire day, person B quickly backed down saying they didn't want it to cause an issue but person A would not budge and refused to engage in conversation. Eventually I said that I would make sure to announce if I was going to visit any of them, to the whole group in advance. This seemed to placate person A and they appeared to drop the whole thing.\n\nThen, last week I played a game with person C and another mutual friend, which the rest of the aforementioned group do not play. After a few hours we tired of it but were still talking, so we jumped on another game for half an hour before saying goodbye. This other game was one which the group do play. Person B noticed that we were playing and sent a message to the group saying 'guess I just play this by myself now'. I didn't want to get into anything (and I'm pretty sure it was mainly a joke) so I left it and replied in the morning that we had only played for a short while before getting off. However, that evening I played the same game again and only with person C. We were just bored and wanted to do something, person B was not about and we had all agreed to play together the following night, so we jumped on for a couple of hours. Whilst we were playing, person A messaged the group chat saying 'guess I'm also not invited anymore, you guys really are fucked up'. When I saw the message, I didn't want to get into a massive argument on a messaging app and I couldn't really tell exactly how serious they were being so I didn't reply. They appear to have muted the group chat and ignored us all since (just over a week). \n\nThey have a history of dealing with problems by cutting the problem out instead of facing it, and other times in the past they have gotten annoyed with somebody and completely stopped talking to them for a few weeks. I want to just leave it until they decide to talk to me, but I'm finding it really hard to cope with feeling like I'm being punished in an incredibly petty way and knowing that if they return to talk to me they won't let me talk about what has happened - they'll want to just pretend nothing happened. Has anybody experienced something like this where they really don't want to just cut somebody off? Is there a way I can help them to open up and talk about it, or see my point of view?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678648947.0},{"title":"Mom won't let me go to my choice of school","author":"_An1matr0nic","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pn76l\/mom_wont_let_me_go_to_my_choice_of_school\/","text":"I'll make it as short as possible.

We(Mom and I) made a deal that if I didn't get accepted she would transfer me to another school of my choice (regular public school). Over the next few months I regretted my decision especially when I realized there was no Orchestra in the school. I started to hate the idea of going to the academy as it's too far, no orchestra and not many familiar people would go there. In late January the school sent me and email stating that I got accepted and that I had the choice to decline or accept. I told my mom that evening and she didn't say anything about it. The next day, all day, she was trying to persuade me to sign up and so on. She went as far as to call every single one of my aunts and people who had kids that also signed up. They all tried to persuade me to sign up for the academy, which I kept politely declining. The next day she woke me up, forced me to unlock my phone, shoved me to the floor, and sat in a chair in front of me. I was on the verge of tears telling her that she can't force me, she then snatched my phone and filled out the form stating that I accepted. Right after she did that she hid my phone and said \"Looks like you're going there now, and you can't do anything about it!\" I locked myself up in my room, crying, my dad came in later saying that he didn't want to see me upset and that if I wanted to transfer I should. I don't know what to do as I want to transfer to the regular school because of orchestra and how much closer it is to my home.

My mom was married to my stepdad, the grandparents I am mentioning are his parents. We have to interact because they made my youngest brother, which is his son, and I've known my stepdad's family for at least 3\/4 of my life. My mother divorced my stepdad because he didn't care for the marriage and cheated with his current girlfriend, who now have four kids together(including my brother). The girlfriend makes me uncomfortable because she's always talking down on my mother when all she does it stay out the way and wants my brother to have a relationship with his father, and I try to interact with her but 9\/10 she has a sour attitude. My mom works hard, has her own business, performs, and even works a regular 9-5. She only ever interacts with stepdad when it's about my brother, but when the grandparents come in town to visit us and the entire family is there it's very awkward because the girlfriend likes to get slick or carries her sour attitude to a family gathering. I've actually tried to be respectful and remain doing so whenever we interact, but she's just very rude. But yeah the family tree on my stepdad's end is very uh...awkward to say the least. But onto the main point:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen my mother and stepdad were married, I spent most of my time with his parents, when they moved away to Indiana, I would spend summers with them. They are devout Christians, my grandfather being a Pastor, and grandmother is First Lady, and not afraid to state it. Church every Wednesday and Sunday, only playing gospel when driving, and events and conventions. The older I became, the more I had started to develop crushes, on both men and women. They claim that they aren't judgmental but even recently my grandfather has always found a way to mention queer people in his sermons, and grandma follows right behind him. I remember her vividly telling me that she didn't want me to like girls and telling me that homosexuality is an abomination before God. I have always been raised in a Christian household and even had strong faith, but battling my attractions at the same time did not help my situation, thinking that I was sinful for being capable to love more than one type of person. When I became a teen, these conversations and feelings became more prominent, and now when I visit, I try to have a good time, but I often know that when they find out they'll cut me off completely, and these thoughts left me to ponder and cry myself to sleep often when I would stay with them for the summer. There was a time that I felt that I would be better off dead, following a (failed) suicide attempt, but I would purposely injure myself. I accepted myself, and later came out to both of my biological parents and both are very accepting and even supportive when I got into my first relationship with a girl in high school. Life has been better for me, and I haven't been speaking to my stepdad or his side of the family for months, and with my graduation coming up, my mother asked if I was inviting them, and I'm not sure if I want to. My brother isn't fully aware that I'm not too fond of his father or that side of the family, so I often put up with them because of him, but I'm an adult, and I want to make adult decisions. But I feel I need another opinion on this. Thoughts?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I love my stepdad's parents, but me being queer and facing religious trauma has tainted our relationship and I want to cut them off completely, starting with my graduation.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678635326.0},{"title":"How do i convince my parents to get a dog?","author":"Entire-Nectarine927","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pn1v3\/how_do_i_convince_my_parents_to_get_a_dog\/","text":"For context I love all dogs.

A little back ground though..  \nI am 24, sadly, and I have been struggling for years to get my life together. My mother has successfully locked me away from the outside world. She prevented me from finishing school, she prevents me from trying to get a job, she refuses to teach me anything about life, ect.  \nExample; I had a job before, but it only lasted like...3 months because she refused to take me and then filled my head with all this false bs, fueling my anxiety to make me not go. She refused to help me get my permit (which I finally got from my own means recently) but now can't get the actual driver's license because I have no car and she refuses to let me drive or learn to drive hers. I **have no friends IRL** and **no family members within my state** to help me or take me anywhere. I don't have a consistent income to uber and I live in the middle of nowhere so nothing is within walking distance. Recently I started to sell a lot of collectables and belongings, doing art and commissions, to try and find a way to move out closer to the city so things are more available to me within walking distance or from buss routes (because they don't go out here where I live), only to recently discover that you needed credit and bank statements that I clearly do not have. I feel stupid for not knowing that, but in my defense my mother hasn't taught me anything I needed to know and I don't even know where to begin to even acquire necessary information. But now I feel lost and hopeless.  \nI have enough to afford an apartment and a couple of months rent with whatever else I need, but now I am scared because I don't have the obvious requirements with bank statements and a credit score to be able to apply. Yea, I could use money to buy a car - but problem - no credit and no knowledge, and not to mention I rather move out of this toxic and vile household and be away from my mothers control and walk places than be trapped forever. My boyfriend doesn't help and he still lives with his parents and I doubt they would let me stay with them because it was brought up before and was told no. I am just now working on my GED, and after that I plan to leave but I don't now how to anymore it seems and I guess my optimistic side was to hopeful for anything.  \nI  don't really have anyone to talk too about the situation, so I came to reddit after finding out that there was a lot of subreddits to ask for advice on numerous of things. It is really needed right now, and anything is needed. Even if it is the harsh cold truth of things. I just need to know what I can do and can not do in a situation like this.

I have had issues finding a purpose (in both long and short term) to still keep up with life, and am in dire need of some advice (which, by the by, I have not been able to recieve in any sphere of life). This might turn out to be a long one, so heads up.\n\nI have had issues with BPD for quite a while now, and I have been struggling with maintaining and balancing relationships for a long time. My first girlfriend had a similar condition, which made the relationship one helluva ride; its conclusion better not mentioned. Shortly after the breakup, however, I was told that I might not actually have BPD at all. It was different with the three psychiatrists I have been to so far, and the state of my mental condition is still rather vague, although I reckon it is BPD given how similar the symptoms are. My second and current girlfriend have been dating for a year, and things have been weird for the most part of our relationship. I genuinely care for her, and even like her. I am unsure of whether or not I love her, snd if I want to stay with her.\nShe was being blackmailed by someone for around three years, and I was lucky to be a part of her journey out of that unfortunate sequence of events. If not for me, she might end up going down the wrong career path, and because I genuinely care for her I do not wosh to do that to her. I also reckon I harbor an asxual attitude, and sex does not excite me. Mastirbation, however, is preferred over sex, and that seems like cheating (if you know what I mean).over my girlfriend.\n\nI'd probably come off as someone really disillusioned, and so I am really hoping someone would want to spare a minute or two, to offer some advice they think might help me in this relationship (and in life in general). \n\nThank you for taking out the time.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678647640.0},{"title":"getting kicked out what do I need?","author":"Professional_Ad_1726","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pmm7h\/getting_kicked_out_what_do_i_need\/","text":"I (18 n.b) and being kicked out and will probably end up in a hostel or shared accommodation im not entirely sure as my 18+ worker is in charge of it (i\u2019m a care leaver) once i get my own place what are the things i will absolutely need, what are things i shouldn\u2019t cheap out on and what can i cheap out on?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678647598.0},{"title":"When should I break up with my bf?","author":"FabulousEast7736","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pmjs6\/when_should_i_break_up_with_my_bf\/","text":"I (19f) want to break up with my boyfriend (20m).

I don't know if I should. \n\nI was at a hotel with my best friend and her 3 children, 4, 6, & 12, and my own 11 year old daughter. We were in the crowded breakfast area. She was having trouble getting her kids to eat their breakfasts, particularly the 4 year old, and commented that it was because they had been snacking on so much gum and candy. She got up to get them something else they would eat, and I stayed and sat with all the children at the table, while my friend made waffles at the waffle maker. The 6 and 12 year old were well behaved, as was my little one. The 4 year old however, was saying things that I found remarkably disrespectful, i.e. \"she BETTER hurry up\" about his mother returning to with his food, etc. \n\nAt one point, the 4 year old decides to get into his mother's purse and pull out gum. I told him to stop, and to put the gum back as his mother was literally fixing his breakfast and had just commented that they weren\u2019t eating because of gum and candy. He looked at me defiantly and continued to open the gum. I got up calmly, walked around the table, removed the pack of gum from the little boy's hand, put it back in his mother's purse, bent down to his eye level and sternly said \"don't test me little boy, I'm untestable.\" \n\nHe proceeded to throw an absolute FIT. Under the table on the floor and everything.\n\nNow for the record, I know his mom\/my friend practices \"gentle parenting.\" She doesn't yell, do time out, or restrictions based on behavior. She believes that even when a child is acting out the best thing to do is calmly reason with them rather than responding with anger. I get that, and I respected her patience, because I THOUGHT that even though she doesn't freak out or lose her cool, the kids still don't get their way, right? That's how I thought it worked. \n\nBut now I\u2019m not so sure because WOW. This little boy was literally telling her \"Will you just shut up and get me my gum? This is taking forever! She's not in charge of us (him and his siblings, in reference to me)\". And she CAVED. She gave that little kid that frickin\u2019 gum. She dismissed it and said he's tired, that he was up late, and that I didn't know he was actually allowed to get in her purse and get the gum if he wanted it. I was absolutely appalled. My child would have never in a million years have been given that gum after my friend, a respected adult in her life, told her no. Especially if that adult had told her no while enforcing something I had just said. \n\nHe got his way, and continued to show his ass even up until we checked out. Throwing boots, punching things, yelling at his sister and mother, stomping, etc. My friend laughed and said \"Haha! He's so tired.\"\n\nI'm angry about this. I feel like not only did she reward his bad behavior which is really none of my business, whatever raise a psycho, but she disrespected me by giving him his way after he made the point of informing her that he did not view me as a person in a position of authority over him.\n\nI love my friend though. I need to just let this go, right? But part of me is plotting ways to reward his siblings in front of him to remind him that his bad behavior has consequences and he did not win with me. I feel anger towards my friend as well. \n\nIs this petty?

Everyone is pretty nice.\n\nExcept for one lately.\n\nThis one guy, I'm not sure how old he is but he's a vietnam war veteran. So I assumed he's around my grandmother's age. He works in the same department as I do and I consider him a mentor, he's very kind, hardworking. Lets call him Bill\n\nBill been teaching me everything I know since I was a new hire but lately I can't shake but get a feeling something feels off and I'm not sure how to approach someone about this issue.\n\nThis behavior started in early February where Bill randomly started asking me for hugs, I considered the hugs to be friendly so I didn't mind it at first and gave him hugs. Then he started gifting me things likes snacks and candy I thought these were really nice of him to do. Like he saw me as a coworker friend or he appreciated how hard I work so I thought it was nice to give Bill things back like snacks such as beef jerky packets or peanuts to show my appreciation.\n\nOne day in late February Bill was handing me a packet of m&ms like he always did. but this time he didn't let go of my hand as he gave me the candy and kissed me on the hand. I immediately felt overwhelmed and uncomfortable by this, this behavior is starting to feel 'unprofessional'. He started making comments to me as well when he'd buy me these gifts such as \n\n\"see how nice I am to you?\" And I'd always just tell him thank  you but in reality I couldn't help but feel so uncomfortable by this. I began to dread coming to work as he started making more off putting comments.\n\nAnother time I was telling Bill a about a trip I had in middle and made a comment like:\n\n\"oh because I am a girl\" he cut me off and said \"you're not a girl you're a grown woman\" yes that may be true I am NOW an adult but the way he said it made me feel disturbed.\n\n every. single. day. He asked me \"did you miss me?\" Even if I just saw him the previous day. And now everyday it feels like he demands I give him a hug everyday before I leave work or when I first see him he'd tell me \"hey I missed you\" but like before I'd seen him the day before. \n\nThere was this other coworker I really liked, i saw him as a mentor as well He's only 12 years older than me lets call him Johnny. Jonnhy Never makes me uncomfortable never asks me for anything never gives me anything and I started comparing the way Johnny treats me to the way Bill treats me taking mental notes to myself in a way trying to justify if maybe I'm just being paranoid with Bill. Johnny is very upbeat and always smiling very welcoming has a way to make others have a smile on their face when they have a bad day. \n\nThe time came when Johnny announced that he was quitting because he found a job that paid him more. I was sad but I was happy for Johnny.\n\nI decided to express my feelings to my coworker, Bill, about how I felt about Johnny leaving. Bill didn't even look at me, he cut me off and said in serious tone \"well you still have me\", i felt dissmissed and even more akward being around him after that.\n\nDays coming closer to valentines day Bill began making me more and more uncomfortable especially since my previous Coworker, Johnny had left.\n\nHe began to tell me \"I want to kiss you on your cheek\" or \"i want to kiss you on your forehead\" when he'd pull me into a hug. I told tell him \"no i don't like kisses\" everytime but he kisses my forehead anyway. \n\nI began to practice aviodance with Bill keeping away from him as much as possible now. It felt like Bill was expressing very possesive behavior towards me. My last straw was when he started asking to be closer to him when we are at work, it's very hard to avoid him because we work in the same department. I can't stand putting up with this anymore, I know the company I work for has an open door policy but I'm terrified of backlash for speaking up. I have some friends and family that I'm close to and I haven't even told them what's going on. \n\nI'm afraid now because Bill is well respected in the company, people look up to him. As an adult I can't help but feel like Bill is taking advantage of my youth and naiveness I feel like he's trying to groom me.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678646732.0},{"title":"DEAD ASS PLANT","author":"Imperious_Waffle397","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11pm8d2\/dead_ass_plant\/","text":"So at work today, a customer returned a dead but pretty smelling lavender plant and he wanted to get a new one, it was a whole ordeal.

Any tips how I can find myself again or detach myself from that relationship slowly?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678646133.0},{"title":"Should I keep a new phone I got the same day I witnessed saw something traumatic?","author":"FBRftw","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/11plyug\/should_i_keep_a_new_phone_i_got_the_same_day_i\/","text":"This may sound very strange but I want to know what the average person would do in this situation.\n\nSo I got a brand new phone after many years of using an old piece of crap. I was super excited and couldn't wait to use it. On the drive home I see a blocked intersection and we are stuck there so I assume an accident just happened. I see a smashed SUV and a bicycle that is absolutely destroyed. I see many people getting out of their cars with a very concerned look and some people are even panicking. I see one of the people that were in the in the SUV breaking down in tears. At that point I knew something horrible happened. \n\nThey move the SUV and that's when I see it. I see the mangled body of a cyclist. Although I'm from a far, I see blood oozing out of his head on the pavement. This is my first time seeing a a dead person in such a graphic way. I immediately feel terrible ans depressed. Not only for the cyclist that was just enjoying a nice day on his bike not knowing it was his last but also for the driver of the SUV who is going to live the rest of their life with someone's death on their hands. \n\nThe remaining day I was depressed and spent the day with my family. Now it's the next day and starting at my unopened phone. I want to know other people's perspectives to see if they would go ahead and use the phone or would the return it\/swap it out. Logically I know it doesn't make difference and it has nothing to do with it but I'm worried about associating it with that terrifying image and depression that followed.\n\nThank you for reading all this.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678646091.0}]
