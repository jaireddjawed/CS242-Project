        "text": "So I've got a bit of a different take on the current social media controversy surrounding our supreme court nominee. I believe it is incorrect to take a definitive stance siding with either of these individuals, because the bottom line is that there isn't enough evidence to know which of the two of them are lying. If the victim is telling the truth, we obviously don't want to disregard her claims. Her testimony should be handled with respect and taken seriously. But we also can't condemn a man based on the *accusation* of another person. Anyone can *accuse* anyone else of literally anything. Imagine if YOU were wrongfully accused of sexual assault, but no one wanted to hear your side because they were *so* caught up in the belief that we should always believe the victim? Not a happy thought. \n\nThere needs to be *evidence* and depending on whether you visit a liberal or a conservative forum, you'll find varying levels of opinions on the existence of said evidence. It's been exceedingly difficult to find unbiased sources in this case that are simply interested in sharing the facts and nothing else.\n\nNow, I'm not interested in debating which of the two of them is telling the truth. My point is, how do we as a society find the balance between showing the victim the appropriate amount of respect and humanity when they are sharing their story, and holding off on making definitive judgments and condemnations against the accused *before* they are found guilty in a court of law beyond a reasonable doubt?",

At the same time people are being warned about the irresponsible and clueless backyard breeders who introduce genetic problems into their litters. \n\nSo what ideally would pet breeding and purchasing look like in the future? I'm wondering because my parents have been looking for a dog for awhile now and so many humane societies are full of pit bulls and chihuahuas and they are struggling to find something else.",
