        "text": "Bonjour, voilà de nombreuses années que je vie dans la maison de mes parents. Ils se trouvent que nous avons été témoin individuellement ou à plusieurs (moi, mes parents et mon frère) de phénomènes étranges. Cependant étant un peut dubitatif à la chose le seul élément dont nous avons été réellement témoin est lié à notre télévision. Je voudrais avoir l'avis de personnes qui pourrait m'aider à trouver une solution terre à terre.\nTout d'abord il faut savoir que sa se résume à 2 chose allumé et éteindre la télévision. Jusque-là rien de très palpitant.\nPour ce qui s'agit de l'allumage il est arrivé plusieurs fois que notre télé s'allume quand nous ne sommes pas dans la pièce et je rajouterai même que pour ce qui s'agit de mon frère et moi nous sommes à l'étage au de côté les plus opposé de la télévision. Cela est arrivé aussi bien le matin que le soir. Quand l'un de nous pouvait ce retrouver tous seul donc sans farceurs juste la télévision qui est allumé dans le salon devant petite précision une chaine autre que celle éteinte par fois. \nCela est arrivé avec nos 3 télévision (une cathodique, télé HD et télé 4k), cela c'est calmé depuis le changement de système qui est depuis quelques années non plus sur une simple multiprise mais une multiprise avec interrupteur avec également un décodeur télé relié à la multiprise. Mais malgré cette sécurité si l'interrupteur est allumé cela peut arriver.\nJe tiens à préciser que cette allumage est depuis petit et que il ne peut rien n'y avoir pendant 2 ans et 2 fois en 3 mois le rythme n'est pas régulier.\nEnfin pour ce qui s'agit du fait que la télé peut s'éteindre c'est ce qui m'a fait écrire ce message. Car c'est un phénomène assez récent et je n'arrive même pas à trouver l'ombre d'une explication.\nIl y a de cela 3 mois je mangeais avec ma mère dans le salon face à la télé et d'un coup la télévision c'est coupé. \nLa où tout est étrange est que la télévision c'est éteinte ainsi que le décodeur sans que la multiprise sois off le bouton rouge de l'interrupteur était toujours vif, aucun télécommande a porté. J'ai du rallumé les deux ainsi que activité l'interrupteur d'alimentation du décodeur.\nMes inquiétudes sont lié à plusieurs éléments :\n- La télévision à ça propre télécommande pour s'allumé\n- Le décodeur télé à ça propre télécommande pour s'allumé\n- L'interrupteur du décodeur un juste un simple on/off sans sécurité et ne peut être utilisé que manuellement \n- Le décodeur est placé de tel sorte que il faut obligatoirement ce levé pour avoir accès à l'interrupteur \n- aucun appareil n'a été touché par une quelconque coupure d'électricité\n- Nous étions seule et nous avons aucun animal de compagnie même pas un poisson\n\nVoilà je ne sais pas si c'est très lisible et également désolé pour les fautes d'orthographes je ne suis pas très bon mais si malgré ça vous auriez des réponses pour aider je serai très intéressé.\nMerci",

        "text": "My FIL had a heart attack and hit his head a few months ago. Since that time, he’s been brain dead in a medical facility. He is currently in a country where withdrawing life support is illegal. He will be kept alive on a vent and support until his “natural” death, if you can call it that, since he’s currently un-naturally alive. I’ve been having waking visions since this happened of him in an old-school Soviet-era bureaucratic office. He’s there, trying to claim his body. He starts each day with a mission: to work his way through the queues of the five windows ahead of him so he can get all the paperwork and stamps needed to claim his body and go home. Each day, when he gets to the front of the line at the final, fifth window, he has run out of time: the bureaucrat behind that window slams it shut and tells him to come back tomorrow. Each day this repeats. Some days he gets closer than others, but every day does not make it to that fifth window in time. My neighbor’s mother comes from generations of women with “the gift.” I asked my neighbor if her mother could communicate with him as he’s in this in-between between life and death, and she told me no. That’s not how it works. She can only clearly communicate with the fully dead. But —- that the family members should tell him that it’s ok to move forward and go towards the light. I didn’t have the heart to tell them. Two weeks later,my neighbor and her mother were doing a reading - and my neighbor’s mother got a message: that I need to tell the family, that my FIL doesn’t fully realize he’s dead, and that he’s lost in the in-between: “Mischa needs her to tell the family. She’s the only one who knows, who can deliver the message.” I never told my neighbor, nor her mother, my FIL’s name, no less his nick name. I still don’t know what to make of this.",

        "text": "Hi, its me again. Maybe you read my previous post and I hope so, so you will understand what I'm about to tell you now. So for a while it all ended and the voice stopped calling me. My girlfriend left me some weeks ago and that made me feel really weak and empty. From that moment on the voice started again, but way worse.\nAs I told you last post I used to dream gore and having nightmares about me eating people alive. Those dreams are not only dreams, I can see them in my mind sometimes. I started having episodes where everytime I talk to someone I get a really strong nausea to the point I almost had to puke. I started having dreams of me mutilating people or images in my mind  of weird dead bodies or head's in state of decomposition in vomit.\nAlso started dreaming about a lot of vomit. The voice don't only calls me now when I'm alone, even when my sister is in the room and during the day when I am alone in house. It started touching me which really scares me. And I started seeing really weird allucination when she calls me. Only last night I saw a weird figure going under the bed on my sister, the worst thing is that it wasn't  a fast thing, it went slowly and was a lot real even though I know it wasn't. I saw My sister being awake and staring at me with wide opened eyes, also heard noises of someone puking under the bed of my sister. In the meanwhile the voice started calling me quite loud and I was scared till the point I couldn't move anymore, I could've but I was way to scare to do anything but look at my phone afraid of crossing eyes with whatever was under my sister's bed or my \"\"sister\"\".\nI started having a really strong anxiety and nervousness and I can get it even with small things. Since it started recalling me I have weird thoughts I don't think I can even tell here. I really hope its my immagination now though.\nI know it doesn't even look like a real story. But it is and that scares me a lot.",

        "text": "Maybe this isn't the place for this but it just happened and I'm kind of sighed out. I just arrived at work thirty minutes ago and had two things happen. For background, I work at a lab at my college.\n\nFirst I walked into work nothing weird until I got in the elevator and went up to the fourth floor. The elevator rose but for some reason passed the sixth floor, not weird cause this elevator is sort of a piece of junk, I think whatever I hit the fourth floor again and wait. It again goes to the first, I tried twice more the next time it again went straight to the sixth floor and then back to first. \n\nI get out planning to go tell the administrator's office that the elevator is on the fritz again, but low and behold my coworker! I say hi and mention the elevator is busted, they ask how so. I proceed to tell them how it went up and down from six for about the last five maybe seven minutes. They give me a weird look and clarify that I had just been in there. I confirm before she tells me she just used the elevator, the same elevator I was on but no one was in there.\n\nThat is unsurprisingly really weird, but I have things to do, I say goodbye after we discuss it for a moment and tell the administration then go back to the elevator and try again to go to the fourth floor this time successfully. I get out and put my stuff in our work area, then decide to go to the restroom. \n\nI stepped into the bathroom and was quickly confused. You see each bathroom has different colored tiles, the fourth-floor bathroom is blue tiles, the first has white, the sixth has yellow, etc. Well when I come in, the tiles are yellow. I brush it off as thinking I'm remembering the tiles wrong. I do my business and leave but to my absolute confusion, I was on the sixth floor. I go back down to forth and my stuff is still there. \n\nI was immensely confused and ended up going to my boss, to have them do a concussion check on me, I had slipped on ice earlier but I thought maybe I hit my head and didn't realize. But from what we could tell I was fine. I told her what was going on. But neither of us has any idea what the hell is going on. That was it though, I went about my business with no other weird things happening, and with no explanation. \n\nSorry I know it might not be that weird but I'm still trying to understand what just happened.",

Before I was banished, I use to stay in what you in your quarters would probably call a hostel or a boarding house of some sort. \n\nThere were four of us staying in the cellar of this particular dwelling, that would be me and three other men/travellers (who I eventually managed to befriend) - Hermaans, Ortneel and Krokki. \n\nThe reason why I'm writing to you tonight is to hear if anyone else has also had strange experiences whilst finding themselves sleeping facing the stars (on their backs)? \n\nI used to sleep always facing the east, however this evening, for some reason, I fell asleep just after dusk 'face-up'. \n\nSomewhere during the evening of sleep, something like a hand made it's way down the stairs and proceeded to push my face hard into the pillow. I did not enjoy this much.\n\nA year or so later, after having been promoted to another room, it happened again, but this time it was some sort of spider on my face and arm. I woke up screaming and fell out of bed. I saw it running away. My bunkmate at the time, uncle Elroy, nearly had a heart attack. Again, I didn't enjoy the experience much. \n\nI haven't slept on back since, and that was many moons ago. Can someone explain why they come for you when you sleep facing the stars (sleep on your back)? Thank you in advance",

        "text": "This is something I experienced years ago and never forgot it. One of my earliest paranormal encounters, but different than the rest. Sharing for the enthusiasts.) \n\nOne night in 2012, my extended family decided to come down. For fun, we all decided we wanted to go “ghost hunting” at a rumored locally haunted cemetery.  We didn’t expect anything to happen. We waited til pitch dark. Important to note: This cemetery is located 11 miles from any town, there is no electricity ran out there, and it’s dead center in the middle of the deep woods surrounded on all sides by trees. There’s only one dirt road in and out of this deep woods area. \n\nI stood by my cousin and watched him take a series of photos. Neither of us had flashlights, and the others were far off on the other side of the cemetery in the back of us to where we didn’t see their phone lights or hear them talking. He took maybe 8 photos of the same grave, never moving from his spot. We physically saw nothing with our eyes but the camera captured something different. The first couple photos were just of the grave. The next was of some pink foggy like mist around the foot of the grave. The next was of the shape of a head sticking out from behind the tombstone. It was shadowy, no discernible features. Just a pink mist. The next photo was of the head and shoulders peaking out, the next was it shooting up to fly away. The next was a plain grave again. It was like something saw us taking pictures, didn’t like it, and literally left the area caught on camera. \n\nIn other pictures I saw that night from my other cousins, and some on my own phone as well, there’s multiple colored orbs flying around trees. Blues, pinks, greens, etc. Nobody captured anything else like I witnessed. These were all grown adults in their 30s, not a bunch of kids mind you. These were all first hand pictures simply taken with phone cameras. I knew they were unaltered. We left after we had enough fun and frankly didn’t think much of it again. \n\nThis was really before we all had a Facebook so nobody posted these pictures. My cousin who I witnessed photographing the body leaving the grave died a couple years later. Never knew what happened to those pictures. Been out to that cemetery a few times since, but never again in the dark. I’ve never caught anything else on camera.",

Then i “fell back asleep” (keep in mind this is all taking place in my dream) I was “woken”  again by my hubby (or something else) saying he came back because he forgot his coat. That’s when the realization hit that something was really off. I knew i was asleep and desperately wanted to wake but I couldn’t. I was in bed in my apartment but everything felt so heavy. It was like groggyness was more than a way I felt but tangible matter, I felt immersed in it. I could see the bottom half of figures in the corner of my eye but wherever I tired to look the “corner” stretched on forever. I could never see or confront whatever was there with me, only see it’s shape and feel it’s presence. This dream felt like forever . At one point I was jumping up and down on my bed begging to wake up. I am not religious but I tried praying . I’m the dream I called my sister on the phone but whoever answered sounded like they were under water. When I finally did wake up for real in this world, I was already calling my hubby on the phone and taking but I don’t know how got my phone or when I actually became conscious.

I went to pick it up, but when I crouched I heard a strange voice whispering her name (my ex). Slowly, in a creepy accent. Everyone in the house was together outside, the bedroom door was closed, the lights were off and only an inch of the window was open. No one inside, of course. Didn't sleep that night and didn't tell anyone, as they probably wouldn't believe me.\n\nSkip 4 years, a couple of weeks before we break up. We were casually chatting when I remember the ocasion and, after all these years, it would be easier to tell her. As I am speaking she went sheet white, and tells me she heard the same thing while showering at her own house (not the beach one), less than a week after we came back. And of course, she imitates the whisper, and it is almost the same as the one I heard.\n\nWell, we broke up some weeks ago, so I will probably never go back to her's or her aunt's houses, but I got really curious about a possible explanation for this.

This place was basically off the grid in terms of electricity, water, etc. and we had to use a generator at night time for power. So, for entertainment during the day we had an ancient battery powered radio that we'd listen to. My parents would turn it on when they woke up and turn it off when they went to bed. \n\nI'm not sure who heard it first, but one of us mentioned hearing the radio during the night, and when they went to turn it off, it wasn't on. Nobody but that person could hear it playing music though. Eventually, it happened to all of us. I remember waking up in the middle of the night and hearing the radio playing. I'd asked my sister (she was playing on her DS) why it was still turned on when nobody was awake. She looked confused and said the radio wasn't on. But I was hearing it, somehow. \n\nOther strange things happened at this shack too. Mostly we'd hear footsteps when we were there alone. I once hallucinated a huge, fat insect flying out of the walls when I was very young. It terrified me, and considering how my sister would patch up the holes in the walls (they were pine planks, so had lots of imperfections) with duct tape, I'd guess she also felt off about them. There were two separate occasions when we turned up and the entire place was infested with fleas. During the nights when it was so silent you could hear a neighbour whisper, there'd be a single loud bang on the tin roof, with no explanation whatsoever. I had nightmares about creatures coming through the access panel above the toilet. Often we'd arrive and light the fire, but the place refused to warm up. Every now and then there'd be an absolutely putrid smell permeating the entire place. No matter how hard we searched, we could never find anything that might be causing it. In certain areas, particularly the bathroom, it felt like when someone attempts to tickle the hairs on the back of your neck, which increased tenfold after dark. Any puppies our dogs gave birth to while at the place died. Long after I stopped being afraid of the dark, I still needed a nightlight to sleep there. And, if we stayed there for too long, we would enter a state akin to depression with no motivation to do anything. \n\nRecently, my younger sister and I were discussing the shack and who/what might be haunting it. I told her I theorised that the spirit was a small boy, but she said she thought it was a tall, gangly man in black whose face is obscured. As soon as she said that, chills skittering through my entire body and I began tearing up because I somehow just _knew_ she was right. We started describing this spirit, and it was exactly the same person. We both started crying (something we've _never_ done together) because the fear was so intense. Just typing this is making me want to hide under my doona, even though I'm a good few hundred kms away from the place. \n\nThe spirit doesn't seem to be evil, but his energy is far from good and I suspect he does not want us there. Nobody knows who he is or why he's there. My theory is that he had some awful depression and possibly committed suicide at the shack, and now he and his energy are stuck there.",

        "text": "I'm a 33 year old man from a very small town in Czech Republic and I'm a heavy smoker. Every night before bed, I go for a small walk to smoke my last cigarette of the day. Those who do this as well will understand when I say I love being alone outside at night. I just enjoy looking at the stars and otherwise misty clouds that cover the moon. I'm a bad singer, so this is also my opportunity to just be alone where no one can judge my little song. Sometimes I sing and sometimes I just hum. I like it, because it just makes a peaceful 'before bed' routine. \n\nA few days ago was different. It was a little later than usual and I had just stepped outside for my nightly smoke walk, but the cold made me reconsider. So, I stayed by my door, huddled in my coat, and halfheartedly smoked my cigarette. \n\nAs I stood there, halfway through my cigarette, I heard something that caught my attention. It was a man's voice, singing a song. At first, I wasn't sure where it was coming from, but then I realized it was coming from somewhere nearby. I liked it, because I always do that too and I just felt some \"me too bro\" kind of way. \n\nCuriosity got the better of me, and I decided to check down the block to see if I could hear it better. As I got a little closer, I could make up the words and my heart dropped once I noticed that it was MY song. And not only that, I realized it came from the area where I usually start singing. Even though I always sing it, every night, and someone might've just liked it, I noped the hell out of there. I'm usually not a coward, but I finished my smoke inside that night. \n\nI know I sound like a pussy, but it actually bothered me so much that I haven't gone for a before bed walk since. Last night when I was in bed, I was almost falling asleep when I heard it again. My song, sung by the same voice. But what's so chilling about this is that it was so much closer. Whoever this is, is he looking for me? Did he just like the little song and did he develop the same kind of routine? Or is it a little darker than I hope? \n\nIt's 10:30 AM as I write this and I haven't felt like this much of a coward in a long time. It just feels off in a way that I can't explain. The energy is way better now and I will gladly go outside, but the night has changed for me and I'm anxious for tonight.",

        "text": "I´m really curious about this, please read.\n\nSince I was 13-14  years old, I´ve have this happen to me. Some days, there is a strange tiredness that takes over me. The best way I can explain it is that it feels like an emptiness taking over my mind, like it went on static like an old TV. It numbs me and sometimes it leaves me so tired that I stay in bed and sleep for several hours straight. That is when I dream of this place.\n\nIs kind of like temple or chapel, round and with a concave dome, it almost looks like a greek tholos. Its build on a small island in the middle of a large lake. Its always at night in there, and the sky, the moon, and the stars look so close and so grand that you feel like you are in outer space. On land there is a very quiet and dark forest, surrounding the lake there is bushes of little, pale blue flowers. A few times, I´ve seen what seems like people dancing inside of the temple, with torches. Every time I´m there, I feel an unbelivable peace, I feel small, and safe.\n\nI never thought much of this recurring dream, because as weird as it felt I always thought it was just a random dream my mind had decided to hold onto. But two weeks ago, I was on a road trip with some classmates and we were talking about strange dreams we have had. I told them about the temple and to my surprise, two of my classmates said thay had had that exact dream too. One of them said she remembered the flowers in particular because in her dreams, she always sat next to the bushes, looking at the temple from the shore. The other one said \"Moon Temple\" (as he calls it) \"had a blue glow sometimes\", and when he said it, it kind of unlocked a memory on my mind, because I remember seeing it glow once too.\n\nThis whole thing send me into kind of a rabbit hole, because I decided to ask more people (friends, family, and other classmates) if they had dreamed of something like that, and several people said they indeed had. INCLUDING the very strange tired feeling previous to the dream. One of my sister´s friends even described the dancing people inside the temple before I mentioned it. \n\nI have no idea what this all means, but now I want to know if more people out there have dreamed with this moon temple. So, has any of you dreamed of it? Or maybe have an idea of what this collective dream could mean?",

        "text": "So this took place many years ago when I was 16 years old. I still remember it like it was yesterday, or maybe last year. I apologize for the length, and for those that read all the way to the end, thank you in advance.\n\nI was hanging out with my boyfriend at the time (let's call him Kyle, not his real name) and we were all alone in his apartment. Just him and I and his cat. It was all very innocent, I promise. \n\nWe sat in his bedroom at one point as he was showing me some pictures that he had drawn. I didn't even know he was artistic (we hadn't known each other very long).   \nHis bedroom had a bed on the left wall, back against the wall in the middle. Just left of the door was a closet, and across the room from it was the window and on the right wall sat a big computer desk. \n\nI'm sure those of you who lived in the 90s will the remember these desks. Big surface, a few shelves on top, underneath the desk was space for the tower on one side and a set of drawers on the other. His desk had 3 drawers on the left side underneath the desk. And, of course we all remember those sliding keyboard slots.   \nKyle walked to the desk and pulled out the drawer completely. Now, these drawers don't pull out all the way, they have a stopper. If you want to remove a drawer you have to pull it all the way and then lift it up and pull it out. This becomes important. \n\nAfter pulling out the drawer he set it on the bed and showed me all of his drawings.   \nThey. Were. Amazing. I was floored.   \nThe drawings were all of people and faces, but I remember one in particular. It was a pencil drawing of a hand holding a pentagram (5-sided star), the three top points each held by the pinky, middle finger and thumb, the other two points pointing downwards towards the ground. The pinky had a couple of blood drops falling from where the point of the star had broken skin and there was a small puddle of blood underneath the hand. It was really an amazing drawing.   \nAnyway, we put all the drawings back in the drawer and slid the drawer back in place and went to the livingroom to watch tv. We made some lunch (fish sticks with potatoes) at some point and went back to hang out in the living room. \n\nAfter a little while we heard a loud crash from the bedroom. And I mean LOUD. We both said WTF? We looked at each other and Kyle said \"it was probably the cat knocked something over\" and got up from the sofa to check it out when we looked down and the cat was asleep on the carpet right in front of us. He was there the whole time. Weird. \n\nWe went to the bedroom and we saw the drawer upside down on the floor and papers littered the whole room. I mean it looked like a tornado has been through there. The room looked trashed. We were shocked for a few seconds but then Kyle just picked up the drawer from the floor and we began putting everything back and slid the drawer back in place. He checked the drawer to see if it falls out if pulled but it stopped as usual. We thought, well, that was weird and returned to the living room.\n\nA couple of minutes go by in silence as we are both pondering what the heck just happened when suddenly the cat, who was still curled up asleep on the carpet woke up and his fur just exploded. He looked feral and twice the size he was a second ago (cats do that when they feel threatened). He started hissing at seemingly no one, so we followed his gaze and it was in front of him and about halfway to the ceiling. \n\nHe then started growling and pounced in the air so friggin high I was stunned. He kept jumping in place trying to catch something that looked just out of reach, and by out of reach I mean the ceiling. We just sat there staring.\n\nSuddenly he took off towards the bedrooms (hallway behind us) and screaming, growling, yowling the entire time. Seconds later he's running  and jumping into the living room, jumping off the walls to make a faster turn around the corner, and through to the galley kitchen (in front of us) towards the dining room. \n\nThe galley kitchen had an entrance on one side of the living room and one on the other near the dining room and balcony door. He ran back and forth through the kitchen to the dining room a few times and then finally one final time he stopped right in front of the balcony door. He stayed there a few seconds panting, fur still raised, tail between his legs, snarling. Then, suddenly, as if nothing happened he curled up by the door and went to sleep.\n\nKyle and I were glued to the couch the entire time, nothing moving except our heads and eyes. As soon as the cat calmed down I said \"ummm... bye\" and left the apartment. \n\nNow, I know some people would say that the cat probably saw a fly or something like that and he was just chasing it and having fun. Those of you who had/have cats would know that is just not true. I have had many cats throughout the years and I have seen them play with flies and insects. This wasn't it. Anyone who has seen a terrified cat would tell you this is what we witnessed. Thank goodness this cat was so territorial that he defended both his territory and us. I just kept thinking of the big knife Kyle used earlier to cut the potatoes and it sent shivers down my spine. If \"it\" can fling a full drawer it can probably fling a knife. \n\nI never went back to Kyle's house. This may also have been the last time we saw each other, I don't remember now. I tried to find him in recent years on facebook but wasn't successful yet. I'm wondering if he remembers this day. \n\nThanks for reading/listening to my story.   \nHas anyone else had a crazy experience with an angry ghost (which is my theory about this incident)?",

No discernible features, just a dark gray figure with a hat, although I would describe the outline of his hat as being like a fedora.  I was wide awake laying in bed when I looked toward the foot of the bed and saw him standing over me there. I looked away and looked back and he was gone. I didn’t feel any maliciousness from him. It felt very neutral.  \n\nThis isn’t the weirdest part.\n\nSo a whole time zone away, the same morning, my mother also was awakened by something.She said she looked and just caught an arm and a hand and then she looked away thinking it was just my stepdad at the end of the bed coming back from the bathroom or something but she turns over and realizes that it wasn’t because he is still in bed sound asleep beside her. This is probably a half hour to an hour before I saw my shadow person. So when I was seeing this shadow my mom says she couldn’t get it out of her head that she needed to text me and this was 4:3/5:00 her time. She would never text me that early normally. So she waited an hr and then she texted me asking if I am doing ok and I ask her if she is ok mostly because this is still early for her to be reaching out. We did not tell each other about what we individually saw this morning until several hours later after work when we could talk on the phone.\n\nWhat does this mean? Is it an omen? Just a coincidence? It just seems so weird to be a coincidence.",

        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nSo first of all I should say I was probably one of the biggest sceptics to ever walk this planet, but I start to think otherwise.\n\nSo to start, when I met my boyfriend he was doing urbex woth his friend group, if you don't know what that is it's an activity where you explore abandoned places. When we started dating he introduced me to the group and they started taking me with them.\n\nLet me tell you, we explored abandoned prisons, hotels, hospitals, psych wards and on our Euro trip we even went to this cabin called \"Statek Pohádka\" in Czechia where MANY people were murdered, and I've never felt anything strange, it always made me curious about what I could find in places like that.\n\nWe have a friend in this group, let's call her Natalie for sake of internet anonymity. Natalie was always \"sensitive\" to things, told us if something felt weird but never stayed back because she felt weird, she always investigated her feelings, until one time we arrived at one place (I won't tell where it is, I have a feeling it's dangerous and I don't want anyone to get hurt because of me)\n\nShe said she is not leaving the car, that something is wrong, we told her not to be a scared chicken and that she should go with us, she insisted on staying, the second I climbed through the window I felt something I've never felt, I felt so scared, my mind was telling me to get the hell out of there, when I looked at my boyfriend and another friend I could tell they felt the same, this sinking feeling going from your chest to the stomach, mind screeming to turn around and run, blood freezing in your veins, heart pounding and the feeling that something terrible will happen if you don't run.\n\nCould anyone who is into these kind of things tell me what was the thing we felt? Are we just crazy? Paranoid even tho it never happened before in worse places then this? I really need to understand.\n\nSorry for post being long, I'm still kinda stressed and I need to vent.",

        "text": "When I was 17 years old, I once got woken up by my dad, since he used to wake me up always before he would take a walk with the dog. First he would wake up my older sister to use the bathroom before me, and when she was like done, he would wake me up. \n\nOkay,, now what’s weird is, he just woke me up and I was just following up my morning ‘rituals’: staying in bed for another 5 min. then switching on the light waking up fast ‘n hard.. followed by going straight into the bathroom, getting myself ready here and go to the kitchen to get myself small breakfast. \n\nMy dad mostly came back in around the time I was done eating and preparing myself to leave for school by cycling towards the bus stop.\n\nSo I did.. I went to the bus stop, got on the bus, stepped over to the second and finally arrived at school. But you know… here something really blew my mind 🤯 My school was CLOSED so.. I started wondering and checking up my online school platform to check if they maybe sent me I was having generally day off. But no.. then I called my mother to check if maybe she knew what happened here.. when I called her she asked me how I already was at school that day. I simply was 1h to early at school, I really got the chills because everything of my ritual really looked the same beside the fact that I indeed was alone on the busses or at the bus stop.. but my dad did wake me up, after checking if maybe the wintertime change (they do this in my country, turning back our clock once a year, in summer we turn it back) did start I really felt like it was more my dads fault but till this day I really don’t know.. \n\nI just decided to go get myself a hot chocolate milk at the gas station next to school.. I didn’t really gave it a lot of attention since I still had to wait for my school to open.\n\nNow 7 years later I really ask myself, what has been going on there. I don’t remember if I even had seen my sister that day, i don’t remember that it was like an hour too dark outside, less cars on the way to the bus stop, on the bus itself.. it’s all vague.. sure the last bus I remembered taking at that moment was pretty empty, and there would have been indeed more people on it but i didn’t even notice it.. but I find it really disturbing that my dad woke me up, what was he experiencing that day being too early at work, I don’t remember coming home that day and even speaking about it.. it does even feel like a dream you know… it’s weird..",

As if my desk had fallen. It was in the same direction as my desk, at the foot of the bed. It was in that spot, without a doubt. When I sat up my cat was asleep, well awake now obviously with the noise. When I looked around everything was in its place. Okay... weird. I was able to lay back down and relax again. Right when I was drifting off the creepiest shit ever happened. \nI heard a very slow, almost eerie music hover over me. No instrument could describe it. It was a high ooooo then dropped lower ooooo. Like a wave. Not human, but a melody a human could hum. When I sat up the music traveled behind me, almost as if it was above or right out my window. For around ten minutes it continued, but got quieter until I couldn’t hear it anymore.\nIt was very pretty sounding, yet creepy. Like I was listening to something I wasn’t allowed to hear. Not necessarily targeted toward me. Just like I was a witness, or someone wanted me to go back to sleep for a while. \nIf anyone has had this experience or knows of anything please comment below?",

It was one of those cribs where the front goes up in down. Once she put him down she heard this beautiful music playing all throughout the house. Meg looked all over the house for the source of the music but found nothing. When she came back to Ron's room to check on him, his cribs gate was pulled down and he was about to fall. Meg rushed to catch him and right as she did the music stopped. From what my dad has told me, there's been more weird stuff that has happened in rons childhood home. Flash forward and ron is about 6. Ron's dad heard him talking in the living room. When the dad asked ron who he was talking to ron said \"my friend\" and pointed at an empty rocking chair. The dad asked ron to describe what his friend  looked like and he proceeded to describe a union soldier to a T. Like i said he was 6 at the time and would have had no idea what that was.\n\nIdk of these stories really belong here but ive been thinking about them for a while and just wanted to put them somewhere.",

        "text": "I'm only 22, so this happened to me when I was 7. I've remembered this for years and nothing before or since has happened to me since, I don't even think it was sleep paralysis. I was fully awake whenever this happened, and I was able to move my body completely, but you can give some insight into what you think. Demons? sleep paralysis? ghosts?\n\nAnyways, when I was 7, me my mom and dad who are divorced now used to live in this little grey house from 2007-2008. It was actually pretty cute looking, but my parents used to fight in it all the time, which seemed like only started whenever we moved into this house. Because weirdly before, I only had happy memories of how my parents treated each other and didn't remember nearly as much violence that happened between my parents.\n\nIt could just be that I don't remember their fights that took place before we moved into this house, however I have a really good memory of everything else that's really specific during my childhood before that. Such as our trip to Disney World that we took in 2006, I specifically remember no fights between my parents happening the entire time we were there. I can even remember the Kodak cameras my mom used to take pictures from back then, a white Disney themed t-shirt that I remember wearing for the majority of our trip to this day, seeing lots of lizards, me wanting to visit this one fake talking tree that had a face down there every day etc. I have a pretty good memory that's vivid from 5 and up.\n\nI even remember the specific apartments that we used to live in next to my mom's parents, (my grandparents) before we moved into this house my experience, I'm going to talk about took place in. My mom has always said my dad always was violent and had anger issues even before I was born when she met him, which I believe since to this day he still has outbursts of anger. However, nothing I remember was as bad as the fights that happened between him and my mom whenever we moved into this house back in 2007. There would be screaming matches daily between my parents, which I would remember yelling at both of them to stop. My dad would also constantly go out drinking around this time period and come home constantly making scary threats towards my mom to kill her and he would sleep with weapons, which he threatened my mom with as well.\n\nAround this time, I remember constantly feeling afraid and watched after my parents would tuck me into bed most of the time. What didn't help was they would always leave my door open, so I always felt like I was being watched by the pitch darkness between the hallway, my door, and at the other end of the hallway where our spare bedroom where our family computer was. You could say it's pretty common for kids to be scared of the dark, but I haven't gotten to my main experience yet. It wasn't uncommon for me to wet the bed at this time and go wake my parents up to sleep with them as a result of my fears. On the night my experience happened, this was one of those many times, only I remember that my mom wasn't in bed, so I went to sleep with my dad. (Can't remember exactly the reason why she wasn't, they might've already separated around this time in the year, or my mom might've been out)\n\nWhile me and my dad were in the middle of trying to lay down and go to sleep, I just remember that I couldn't fall asleep that night. I was laying down and so was my dad, but I just couldn't sleep and at some point, I remember dads' little TV that he had in his room flashing blue and making a static noise. However, I remember I told my dad this, and he didn't believe me and told me to go to sleep, eventually after a few minutes I started noticing what looked like these creatures to the right side of me, both waddling on the bed towards me and some to the right of me on the floor.\n\nI remember only one of them being on the bed that kept it seemed endlessly waddling towards me, looking at me and turning it's head to the left on repeat. Two of the same creature was on the floor standing to the right off the bed, they all resembled penguins to me, but they were all pure grey and black, and seemed to be made of pure static. You could make a beak out of the body shape, as well as wings, however I can't remember what their feet looked like exactly. At the same time that I saw them, I was also seeing and feeling other things in this room that shouldn't have been there, such as I eventually started feeling the sensation of worms crawling on my body and I remember that I could also see them.\n\nTo my left on the wall, there looked to be what's hard to describe as a giant strip of a lettuce lined like creature that was moving with small little skinny/stringy tentacles on the side and like a purple mask in the center of it. This whole time I was telling my dad I was seeing some things and I was making nervous whimpering noises like a scared child does, but I remember he kept saying he didn't see anything that was going on. I think he thought I was just fighting sleep, but I was genuinely seeing things and at one point I tried waving my arm towards this waddling creature's body, but it just went straight through.\n\nThis all lasted for about an hour from what I can remember, before they all slowly started to disappear. To this day nothing similar has ever happened to me since or before that incident, so I'm convinced I experienced something interdimensional myself. I later found out that whenever we moved into that house from my mom years later that every single couple who's lived there has apparently broken up, but I don't know how true that is. I also heard that house was built on Indian burial. What do you all think I may have experienced back when I was a kid? it also feels like not long after this, that's when I got stuck with chronic depression and anxiety/paranoia that's still present. Sometimes I feel I'm destined for something.",

        "text": "I haven’t shared this story with a lot of people. Mainly because I’ve just never been given the opportunity to bring it up. But me and my sister shared an experience that we will never forget. When I was around 7 and my sister was 9 my family moved into a house that was beside a huge cemetery. I’m talking thousands and thousands of bodies buried there. Along with a mausoleum that had probably a hundred or so people it in. You couldn’t see our house from the road, it was hidden by trees. So our driveway was long, and as you drove up our drive way you could literally read headstones. It was convenient for my family at the time because my dad worked at this cemetery as a grave digger. \nAs young kids my sister and I weren’t scared of this house or the cemetery. We hadn’t really ever been exposed to the idea of paranormal things yet. We actually would spend a lot of time walking around the cemetery and the fountain thats there. We would also go visit our dad while he was at work. But my parents were kind of off put about the house once we started living there. I remember them mentioning how there were holes in the corner of the rooms like the previous owner had cameras in the house. But as kids, we didn’t really get why that would be weird. \nMy moms mom lived with us at the time. We called her nanny. She had strokes in the past, and was kind of frail. She couldn’t walk that well and needed assistance doing certain things. She was just really weak from her strokes. But at this point in time her mind was still sharp. My nanny’s room and my sisters room were connected by a bathroom. So each room had a door to the bathroom. \nOne day my parents went to grocery shop and left us with my nanny to watch us. It probably wouldn’t have been a good idea to do that, but my sister and I were pretty well behaved. We wouldn’t do anything bad or give her a hard time. My sister and I were sitting in the middle of my sisters room playing on the floor. All of a sudden the bathroom door, that was closed, started shaking violently. Like someone was grabbing the door knob and shaking as hard as they could. We immediately got up and went to my nanny. She was sitting in her room watching tv. We stayed in her room until my parents came back. I know for certain it wasn’t her, because she would’ve said so. Even then, there’s no way she would have been able to shake that door like that. She was just too weak. \nMy sister had other things happen in that house. Like figures peaking in at her through the crack in her bedroom door. We also would see a little girl with black hair, most of the time not even inside our house. Mostly outside around our house. That’s the only paranormal things that I have ever experienced. But to me, it’s significant especially because I wasn’t the only one to witness it. And my nanny was there to verify it wasn’t her.",

This whole time I was telling my dad I was seeing some things and I was making nervous moaning noises like a scared child does, but I remember he kept saying he didn't see anything that was going on. I think he thought I was just fighting sleep, but I was genuinely seeing things and at one point I tried waving my arm towards this waddling creature's body, but it just went straight through. This all lasted for about an hour from what I can remember, before they all slowly started to disappear. To this day nothing similar has ever happened to me since or before that incident, so I'm convinced I experienced something interdimensional myself. I later found out that whenever we moved into that house from my mom years later that every single couple who's lived there has apparently broken up, but I don't know how true that is. I also heard that house was built on Indian burial. I have a drawing I drew of what I remember the creatures I saw looking like that I might post on another subreddit, but what do you all think I may have experienced back when I was a kid?",

        "text": "I think it all started a month or two after he passed. I'd have nightmares about him rotting away and looking worse than what the cancer did to him. He'd act like himself but no one in the dream thought it was him. He was suffering so much in the dreams but would never die. Even when he did, he would always come back. No matter what I did, he would suffer. I think my brain still thought he was in pain and was hiding somewhere. In these dreams, I never thought this was him.\n\nI had these nightmares once a week about 3-5 times. I finally told my grandma about this and she said not to accept them, that it wasn't my grandpa and that he wasn't suffering anymore. She sent me pictures of him being happy and I looked at them before I went to sleep.\n\nI had the nightmare again but this time I was aware that it was a dream. I asked him why this was happening and he just said it was for a reason and then I woke up. I dreaded having it again and tried to think about all the happy memories. They stopped for 2 weeks and then it happened again.\n\nI was back at my grandparent's house, I was looking for my grandpa but I didn't see him. I went downstairs and it was a lot more calm and bright instead of creepy and dark. Some family members were down there watching tv and I noticed how blank the walls looked. He was there and instead of opening his mouth to talk, thoughts would just enter my mind. He taught me how to paint the walls (it was a passion of his), and it was something I had never learned before. It just seemed so much like him and my mom confirmed that all the things he taught me was correct.\n\nThe nightmares definitely could've been the grief and the dream could've been something I had learned before and forgot but I don't remember that at all. That dream made me really happy though and I've been wishing that I get more like that. It really felt like he was there. I hope this brought comfort for some people.",

Well, when I was about 6 months old, he ended up having either a really bad heart attack, and ended up passing away. \n\nWell, for a little while after his passing, my mom saw some…odd…things happening. For one, she would oftentimes see me hysterically laughing at the corner of the room. Like, the kind of laugh babies do whenever you play with them. And this happened OFTEN. For another, every day, around lunchtime, my mom would hear our metal gate squeak open, like if someone was walking through it. But every time she looked, there was nobody there. And this happened for a while after his death. \n\nSome other spooky things have happened to me since then, but that’s the only paranormal story I know about that happened directly to me (there is another that’s relating to me, but that happened before I was born)",

I'm from the EU and this house has cement filled walls so I've already ruled out mice ect. Every room has hardwood floors btw. My partner woke me up at 4 am the other night to a sound of knocking. A very slow knock that sounds like it's coming from down stairs under our bedroom. I went and checked everywhere even outside and around the house for her. I checked in each bedroom just in case there weren't any intruders. After I checked it went away. Last night there was a loud thud as if someone slammed a door really hard downstairs. It was so loud it made our bedroom door creak and kind of pop. ( Like the sound of the house just settling) I was awake for this but my partner wasn't but it woke her up. Now tonight, my partner is sleeping beside me as I speak. I hear little steps but very separated apart, I'd say 3 seconds apart. I turn on my fan to drown out the noise and I still hear it. Mind you, when I go downstairs and look around. it goes away. (Fyi) I have no central heating and air in my house or anything that could really make noises. It's a 5 bedroom 2 bathroom house built in the 1840s. We're just two people no kids or animals. I don't really believe (or not) in ghosts cause I never experienced anything. Please help.

        "text": "I apologise in advance for how long this may become.\n\nBefore I was born, my mum had been standing in front of the kitchen sink when she felt a hand on her shoulder. When she turned, there was nobody there. On a different day, my dad had been standing in the same spot in front of the kitchen sink when he felt my mum hug him from behind. However, when he turned around to hug her back, there was nobody there.\n\nGrowing up, there were always strange, inexplicable incidences. I don't remember much before my teen years, but as a teenager this spirit seemed to take a particular interest in me. Maybe it was because I acknowledged her, and I wasn't afraid. My aquarium light would turn on to a random setting on its own, and more than once I felt someone behind me when I was home alone. My bedroom door would also open a little bit every now and then, as if my mum was checking on me or someone had slipped into my room. There was a shadow figure that I often wrote off as being in my head, but two of my friends saw the shadow person moving throughout the house on the same night but at separate times. \n\nMy odler sister came to visit once when I was about 15. She'd brought a ouija board with her and managed to coax me into trying it at roughly midnight that night, once our parents were in bed. Our mum never wanted us to try out a ouija board due to a really bad experience of hers with one when she was our age. Curiosity got the better of me though, so we set up the board in front of the kitchen sink. Soon enough the planchette was moving to our questions. I thought maybe my sister was playing with me, but she's too boring for that to even enter her mind. Here are some of our questions and answers:\n\nQ: Where are you from?\nA: Britain\n\nQ: Are you a woman?\nA: Yes\n\nQ: When did you die?\nA: 42\n\nQ: When were you born?\nA: 4\n\nQ: Were you a mother?\nA: Yes\n\nQ: How many kids did you have?\nA: 2\n\nQ:Are you attached to something in the house?\nA: Yes\n\nQ: What are you attached to?\nA: [No answer]\n\nQ: Do you know who this is? (My sister talking about me)\nA: Yes (spells out my full name)\n\nQ: Did you watch us grow up?\nA: Yes\n\nQ: Were you the one turning on my aquarium light and such?\nA: Yes\n\nQ: How did you die?\nA: [Unintelligible answer]\n\nAt about that point the answers became mostly indecipherable so we decided to say goodbye. Other things have happened since, which I attribute to the spirit just telling us she was still around. I sadly moved out a few years after our ouija experience, but I keep thinking about that spirit. She was born and died roughly 2000 years ago, in Britain, and was now attached to something in our house in Australia. I have no idea what she could possibly be attached to in that house/how it got there.\n\nApparently, when my family sold my childhood home where all this happened, the spirit was extra active. My mum said it was as if she was protesting us leaving. \n\nI find myself missing this mysterious spirit that watched me grow up. My current house feels quite empty without any paranormal activity in it, and she was definitely the kindest spirit I've encountered so far.",

I keep my bedroom door open at night because my only heater and air-conditioner is in my living room.  \n\n3. My bedroom light turned on by itself when I was going to bed once.\n\n4. I have 4 posters in my living room hanging up in frames. My friend was over for dinner and actually witnessed it. He said the poster just ripped off the frame and feel on the floor. When I came around the corner, I saw what he said. The frame was still on the wall, but the poster and the plastic frame holding it in place were ripped off.  This was not a cheap frame. The plastic is attached to the sides, so to see it on the floor was weird. I had to buy a new frame, obviously. \n\n5. Very often, a few things on my computer desk are moved. A green vile that is a cool little residential evil  decoration. It has a grey label on the front, so that's how I know it moves. I always have it facing forward, but it often moves to the side or completely around. The other two things on my desk are an Earth Bound Mold and a little pumpkin plush that looks like a jack o lantern. I face them towards me, but they always move back to looking at each other. \n\nThat's all I can remember currently. I'll post more when I remember or if new things occur.",

        "text": "So the past few nights I’ve been having weird dreams that seem to be connected and possibly warning me of something. Trying to get some feedback on this. \n\nDream 1: Had a dream last night. It was outside the apartment my dad died. (Which seems to be more common than one hope, always different scenarios, sometimes dad is there sometimes he isn’t. One time I dreamt I was there doing dishes and he was behind me talking but as a blue glow transparent ghost form) anyways Outside the living room window was a small patch of dirt (in both childhood remembrance [used to be my garden as a kid] and in the dream) in the dream my dad was sick, I think. There was something about sick/sickness/ deterioration of health. Anyways, I stepped on the patch of dirt and it became a sink hole and I fell in. I was looking up at him and behind him there was a tornado forming in the sky, quickly. I want to say there was another person, possibly female (unknown as to who) on another side of the hole. Only appearing as a dark silhouette.  At this point still in the dream I started trying to figure out what this dream was telling me (usually what we do when we awake from dreams) Like I became aware of the dream state and had conscious movement in it (which happens from time to time) I think he was trying to tell me about sinking/spiraling into a severe sickness. Or falling “gravely ill “ idk. I’m probably overthinking and being stupid like always.   \n\nDream 2: \n\nI was watching someone getting out of a car from the living room window. She was carrying someone. I unlocked and cracked open the front door but no one came inside. I want to say that the person was one of my “evil” step sisters. The older one. Queen C***. Lol who she was carrying, I do not know. Carrying I want to say it was Queen C***. Being carried, dunno, smaller in size but a bit more, plump. Short and fat-ish. Also I want to say that the house I was at was the house I lived at with the step sisters and their dad after my dad died. But it’s confusing. I was in the house and it looked like the house but looking out the window the view was from the house next door if that makes sense. \n\nI’m not close to either of the step sisters. I hate them. They hate me. We keep our distance. Also my exwife brought up that it could be about her since my dad never met her and wouldn’t know what she looks like. Which makes me think that the silhouette female in the first dream could be my mom, since I have no memory of her and since the emergence of dream 2 showing one of the sisters. To clarify the same and the step sisters have the same mom but different dads. \n\nBack to back dreams are very rare for me. I can only recall it happening once before. That series went on for like a week straight and was very odd",

        "text": "So back when I was younger I lived in a big house, in my room there was always this dark dusty closet that I never used. To get to it, you had to crawl through a small door about a little smaller than half the size of a normal door. I never went in there for a reason, for one, the room was covered in child’s drawings all over, words, pictures, and other disturbing and unexplainable stuff I’m not gonna say. Oh and quick note I was not like 16 in this story, I was like 8 or 9.\n\n So, for the first few years in this house nothing ever happened, it was peaceful, but eventually we had to take off the door for a reason I forget. When my dad first took the door off it was fine, it smelled a little dusty in my room but nothing really happened. However, that night I could not sleep. All I smelled was something rotting, I kept smelling this for another 3 nights. I didn’t want to tell my parents as they were busy all the time while this was happening so it would just be a hassle for them. I could only smell rotting during the night, so I decided to go looking for what it would be. I looked all over my room and found nothing, the last place to check was the closet… There was a pile of dead rotting rats, atleast 8 of them. I screamed and my parents came in, cleaned up the rats confused on how they got in. Thought this was the end? Wrong. The next night I was hearing creaking floorboards and something mushy moving in my room. I tried to ignore it but could not fall asleep. The next morning I found all of my dolls had black paint on them and holes in their face, I ran to my parents asking if they did it, they said no. I asked my cousin as she had been over a few days before, she said no. I did not really have friends at the time because we lived in the middle of nowhere, so there was nobody else to ask. The next morning I had a smudge of black paint of my face, our paint is still in boxes in the storage room so I was confused. Once I got the paint off I realized underneath the paint I was bleeding, not a terrible amount but more than the amount from a paper cut. The next night I decided to go into the closet and found a small whiteboard with a heart on it. And that was the last night I was hearing stuff.\n\nIt was weird and uncomfortable, for all I know it could have been a prank but there were some things that I don’t think you would do in a prank. Either way I just recently remembered this and wanted to share it, it’s not the most creepy story on this page but whatever.",

        "text": "Deep in the forests of Karpacz lies an eerie and disturbing history. A story so terrifying that it sends chills down the spines of the bravest souls. During the Second World War, German soldiers, on their mission to establish their supremacy, resorted to performing dark rituals at the Sanssouci Hotel.\n\nRumors have it that the Germans conducted black masses at the hotel, calling upon evil forces to aid them in their mission. These forces, they believed, would provide them with the power they needed to overpower their enemies. The black masses were led by a mysterious figure, believed to be a high-ranking member of the German army.\n\nMany locals who witnessed the hotel's activities during the war still talk about the eerie energy they felt emanating from the building. They could hear the sound of chanting and music late into the night, and the glow of candles flickering from the hotel's windows.\n\nBut that's not all. The soldiers had another dark secret. They constructed stone pentagrams hidden in the forests near the hotel. The pentagrams were believed to be a key part of the dark ritual, a portal to a demonic realm that the soldiers were trying to access.\n\nAccording to legend, the Germans conducted the ritual in the middle of the pentagram, calling out to the spirits of the forest to come to them. The locals have claimed to have seen strange apparitions in the forest near the hotel during the time the Germans performed the ritual.\n\nOne such story tells of a group of teenagers who ventured deep into the forest at night, in search of adventure. They stumbled upon one of the stone pentagrams, and one of them, intrigued by the symbols, stepped into the center of the circle. Suddenly, the air around him grew cold, and he felt as though he was being watched. He tried to step out of the circle, but his feet would not move. His friends, who were too scared to approach him, could only watch as he slowly disappeared into thin air, never to be seen again.\n\nAs time passed, the locals became increasingly uneasy about the hotel and the forest. They believed that the evil forces summoned by the Germans still roamed free in the forest, waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc. The hotel was left abandoned, but its dark past still haunts the forest, and the locals, to this day. Some say they still hear the sound of chanting in the middle of the night, and the trees themselves seem to carry the weight of the horrors they witnessed.\n\nThe Sanssouci Hotel, once a symbol of luxury, became the epicenter of evil, and the pentagrams hidden in the forest became the gateway to hell. The truth behind these stories may never be known, but the locals believe that there are some things better left undisturbed, some secrets that should never be unearthed.",

        "text": "In the small town of Miłków, nestled in the heart of the Krkonoše Mountains, there lies an abandoned paper factory that holds a dark and mysterious history. Legend has it that the factory was cursed by a disgruntled employee, and that a malevolent force has haunted the site ever since.\n\nThe story goes that in the 1950s, the paper factory was the largest employer in the town. It was a bustling center of industry, with workers operating huge machines that churned out paper products day and night. But one worker, a man named Jacek, was unhappy with his job and with the way the factory was run. He felt that the management was taking advantage of the workers, and that they were not being treated fairly.\n\nOne day, Jacek had finally had enough. He stood up in the middle of a shift and began to rant and rave about the injustices that he and his coworkers had to endure. The management tried to calm him down, but he wouldn't listen. Eventually, he stormed out of the factory and was never seen again.\n\nThe next day, when the other workers arrived for their shift, they found the factory in disarray. The machines were all turned off, and there was paper scattered everywhere. It was as if someone had gone on a rampage. But the strange thing was, there was no sign of Jacek. He had vanished without a trace.\n\nAfter that day, strange things began to happen at the factory. Workers reported hearing strange noises in the middle of the night, as if the machines were running even though no one was there. They also reported feeling a cold chill in the air, and seeing shadowy figures moving about the factory floor.\n\nOver the years, the factory went through a series of owners and management changes, but the strange occurrences continued. Eventually, the factory was closed down, and it has been abandoned ever since. But locals say that if you listen closely on a quiet night, you can still hear the sound of the machines running, and that if you look closely enough, you might catch a glimpse of Jacek's ghost haunting the factory.\n\nDespite the many rumors and legends that surround the former Miłków paper factory, it remains a popular destination for thrill-seekers and ghost hunters. Some say that the factory is cursed and that no one will ever be able to make it successful again. But others believe that with the right approach, the factory could be revitalized and brought back to life. Whatever the truth may be, the legend of the Miłków paper factory continues to capture the imaginations of those who hear it.",

        "text": "The semi-circular dam on the Łomnica River was a magnificent feat of engineering, built to prevent another catastrophic flood like the one that occurred in 1897. The dam was a crucial component of the flood control program, which regulated the river's flow and mitigated the potential for damage. However, as time passed, stories began to circulate about strange occurrences and unexplained events surrounding the dam.\n\nThe stories started with reports of strange noises coming from the dam's overflows. People living nearby claimed to hear sounds of rushing water, even on days when the river's flow was minimal. At first, people wrote these reports off as the imaginings of people who lived in the shadow of the dam. But soon, more and more strange events began to take place.\n\nOne evening, a group of hikers who had been trekking the red trail that crossed the crown of the dam reported seeing a figure standing at the edge of the reservoir. The figure was tall, with a long, flowing cloak that seemed to billow in the wind. It stood perfectly still, staring out at the water. The hikers, spooked by the sight, hurried away and did not look back.\n\nAs word of the strange figure spread, more people came forward with their own tales of paranormal activity around the dam. Some reported seeing the figure standing on the crown of the dam, while others saw it walking along the riverbank. Some even claimed to have seen the figure moving underwater, its cloak streaming behind it like seaweed.\n\nAs the stories multiplied, people began to speculate about who or what the figure might be. Some suggested that it was the ghost of one of the workers who had died during the construction of the dam. Others believed that it was the spirit of an ancient water god who had taken up residence in the river.\n\nRegardless of the cause, people in the area began to avoid the dam, fearing that they too might see the ghostly figure. Some even started to call the dam \"the cursed dam\" and refused to go near it. Despite the eerie stories, the dam continued to perform its vital function, regulating the river's flow and preventing floods.\n\nOver time, the stories faded away, and the figure was seen less and less. Eventually, it became nothing more than a distant memory, a spooky legend that parents told their children around campfires. But even today, some people still claim to see the figure standing on the crown of the dam, staring out at the water with an inscrutable expression on its face.",

        "text": "There are several incidents in my life which I think are likely brain farts, but who knows they might be something else, so I'll list them here:\n\n2014, 8pm: I was crashing on my sister's couch, and there's a shared bathroom. I saw her housemate get out of the bathroom and went in to shower. However, as soon as I stepped into the door, I felt something and looked behind. I saw her housemate again, but walking in the other direction....then disappeared into thin air.\n\n1. 2016: I was working in an oil rig in the middle of the forest. FYI: an oil rig is basically like a construction site with people wearing helmets and coveralls. We work out of different offices (basically looks like a shipping container each). Company staff like me wore orange coveralls, while contractors wore blue coveralls. I had to go to a different office (Office B) on the other end of the rig to meet with two contractors (blue coveralls) every now and then.  So one time at 4am, I walk out of my office (Office A) to go to Office B and notice someone in orange coveralls and helmet walking ahead of me. I continue walking all the way to Office B, which the guy in front of me seems to be headed to as well. He was right in front of me when we were directly in front of the door to Office B. However, when I opened the door, there was no one except for the 2 contractors in blue coveralls. I asked, and no one came in before me, and both of them were already inside for hours.     \n2. 2021: One time I saw my sister seated at a table downstairs, but when I went upstairs there she was in her room. I looked again downstairs and there was no one there.\n3. 2022: I had a big argument with my wife on Christmas Eve and we slept in separate rooms that night. I saw up reading that night and I heard a soft knock on my door and a soft \"Honey\". Still angry at her, I didn't respond. The next morning I got up early to have breakfast but I noticed my wife had gotten up even earlier than me, which was strange for her. We made up the day after and talked about our experiences. My wife did not knock on my door that night and say \"honey\". What was more scary was the fact that that morning she was woken up at 5am by knocks on the window and someone calling \"honey.\" But she could not see anything or anyone.\n4. 2022: One afternoon, as I fell asleep, I heard \"They cannot help you.\"\n5. 2023: I had a dream about being haunted, and heard \"Come here.\" as I woke up.\n\nThese are some of the things I've experienced which I think were visual and auditory hallucinations. Or were they? What does r/ paranormal think?",

While walking we came across a black cat sitting in the dark that refused to break eye contact with us. We continued on in which something obviously upset my bf. We then heard a cat that sounded like it were in pain. My boyfriend proceeds to start ushering that we get back to the dorms. When I looked up another black cat was standing in the middle of the only lit path. I got that pressure in my chest, and I usually don’t get scared but something felt off. My boyfriend was freaking out but didn’t say anything til we got back to the dorm. The entire time waking back it just felt off, like I was being watched.

He said he swore he say a shadow move behind some construction stuff and then the painful meowing started. I asked if he was sure it wasn’t just an animal or a shift in light, but he said it had to be bigger like a person from his shape. The anxiety still hasn’t gone down and something doesn’t feel right.

My phone was on the bed near my leg and I had a pair of overalls hanging from the top of the wooden bed beam which the entity was infont of. After about 3 seconds of looking at it and trying to figure out what the heck was going on, it instantly disappeared like it pressed a button. At that point my hanging overalls came back into view.\n\nI didn't feel any malicious energy from it, just very startled with my heart beating. It was extremely creepy. Earlier that day, I found that someone had taken one of my older phones and I spent an hour looking for it, feeling very irritated that I couldn't find it.

        "text": "This happened 9 years ago during my husband’s deployment. \n\nWe lived in military housing. It was just me and my 19 month old son in the house. \n\nMy aunt and I were very close. She died of ovarian cancer 2 months before my son was born. I stayed with her through hospice care. She tried really hard to stay alive until his birth. I’m glad she at least got to feel him kick and move around. \n\nThat day was normal. I spent a couple hours chatting with a childhood friend. Went to bed like normal. \n\nI get woken at at 3am to every door on the 2nd floor slamming open at once. The force they slammed open, put holes in the wall. I nearly pissed my self. I sit up and freeze. Trying to process what just happened. Silence. Then I heard my aunt’s voice baby talking and cooing my son, from his room. My son is responding to each time I hear her voice. He’s squealing, giggling, baby belly laughing, and shaking the crib. So I hear her, baby responds, hear her , baby responds, and so on. This went on a couple minutes. I start bawling my eyes out because I’ve missed hearing her voice so much. I get up and start walking to my son’s room. They are still continuing until I enter the room. Her voice stops. My son is all happy and riled up. \n\nI took him and we went to sleep downstairs. I was too freaked out to stay up there. I spent the rest of deployment sleeping on the couch. \n\nThe next day, my nerves were shot. I tried contacting my friend but didn’t hear from him. I tried contacting my uncle to see how he was doing. Don’t hear from him either. Called my cousin and found out my uncle killed himself because he didn’t want to live without my aunt anymore. \n\nThe childhood friend I was talking to  committed suicide that night too. He was talking to all his loved ones before he took his life. He didn’t sound depressed or off. It was the usual banter about the outdoors and science fiction. He was always the strong happy one in the group. \n\nStill dealing with survivors guilt. \n\nI patched the holes in the walls. That never happened again with the doors. \nI don’t drink or do drugs. I’ve been in therapy and I have anxiety and depression, but nothing that causes delusions like that.\nI’m not into the new age spiritual stuff, so this was very strange for me. \nFinishing the last class for my MBA after that was really hard. \n\nThat was the worst week of my life so far. I lost 2 loved ones in the same night from suicide. \n\nThis experience was the weirdest paranormal encounter I’ve had.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I had responded to a comment earlier about mimic ghosts. I mind as well share my horror story . This happened when I used to live in upstate ny. i moved to philadelphia and i barely see or hear ghosts for over 12 years now except for some nightmares and sleep paralysis.\n\n&gt;!In upstate ny, every house I lived in was haunted. The most haunted house was this 3 story house. It has an attic, a second floor, a first floor and a basement.  You can turn this into a duplex rental. Upstate, NY houses are very cheap compared to NYC houses. You can get a 4 bedroom house in Upstate NY in 1999 for only 70k. You can see why the spirits never leave, murdered or not. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!So this horror story happened when I was a little kid. We lived in that big old dying house. We didnt experience activity for 6 months, close to a year. We also speak another language so I am assuming the ghosts didnt like us and is racist lol. Because the activity got really really bad and we didnt even bring anyone in to bless the house or try to communicate with those ghosts. My former aunt sold the house for cheap and we moved somewhere else. Whats funny is the new house we moved into is also haunted......!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Anyways the activity skyrocketed after living there 6 months to a year. It started with misplaced objects, missing objects appearing in another room or random places in the house. It went from that to mimicking my familys voices and habits. I also saw a little girl whose face is blurred out. She was wearing an old fashioned dress . She did not show me her face, it was white and blurry. I saw a shadow dart back and forth., My mom saw a full bodied ghost of a black man walking from the fireplace to the bathroom and then disappearing. She saw him at 5 am when she was in the kitchen looking out into the living room. The ghost showed her his full face. She said she saw everything as if he was alive but he disappeared into the bathroom wall. I was a little kid at that time so I have no control over what my family reacted. if i still lived in NY, i would have  looked up the history of the house. its too late. The ghost went from showing themselves to mimicking. The mimicking was the creepiest and scariest memory I had. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I was 10 yrs old and i remember coming home from school. I was alone upstairs. the dogs are always downstairs at the time. The ghost watched my routine and knew when I came home from school. Right when I went inside my room to change . I began to hear the dogs whining and barking in the upstairs living room. I walked out to go look for the dogs. I saw nothing. I went back to my room. I heard the dogs barking and whining again in the living room. I came to the living room to look for them, again I saw nothing.. This ghost messed with me for a week until week I got sick and tired of it. I came home from school and I closed my door . I began to hear the dogs barking and whining again. This time, I IGNORED IT. It got more frustrated. It kept mimicking the dog barking and whining, like it escalated louder and louder. I never came out of my room. I kept the door shut. All of sudden, everything went dead QUIET. it grew silent. It never try to mess with me again but it went on to mimic all of my familys voices. everyone in my family all saw something and heard other family members voices calling out to them. we would ask each other \"why did u call me \" and each time we would respond to one another saying \"no i did not call u at all\". My brother heard me talking and calling out his name from my room and I was at school at the time. he was home sick. he told me about it. he said he heard me talking in my room and he went in to check and no one was there. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!My mom also had a dream that one of the ghosts was telling her they dont like us talking in an asian language LOL. She confessed years later after we moved out. for some reason the ghosts only appear to her . I only shadows and blurry faces and hearing mimic voices. she saw the whole face, and even have dreams. This time it wasnt a black man. she said she had a dream she saw a white man came to her and he told her in english he doesnt like us talking in an asian language he doesnt understand what we are saying. Only me and my brother speak both languages, we always speak in english so the ghosts was able to understand. it was crazy and it got worse and worse until we moved.  We began to hear footsteps walking in the attic and around the house at night. The tv would turn on and off by itself. Doors open and close by itself. there is a door upstairs that would NOT close no matter what. u close it and the next day it is wide open. this was back in the 90s so my family never thought thought to buy cameras to see why the door keeps opening by itself.  It got worse to the point where each family member was being haunted by a specific ghost. My aunt kept seeing this ghost of this woman that had a routine. She would see the woman walk past her bedroom door . she followed the woman to the top of the stairs and she saw the woman walk downstairs and all of a sudden just disappeared. she would see the ghost woman walk from downstairs to upstairs . I have a feeling that is the ghost that keeps opening the door in the back. I am assuming she might have been killed while she was in that house and she does not know she is dead.  I also had a dream about the same little girl that I saw before. at that time I was only 10 yrs old, I think that girl wanted to be friends. My brother had stolen one of my toys . I was crying and looking for it. I had a dream where a little girl in an old fashioned dress with a blurred out face came and talked to me . she showed me where the toy was hidden. I woke up and I went to the side of my grandma bed and there was my toy hidden in the crack between the bed. The little girl is a good spirit but the rest of the spirits was getting worse. I had a feeling if we did not leave that house, everyone in the family would die one by one. I think the ghosts was angry because we split the house up and turned it into a duplex. we also rearrange everything in the house and threw away creepy old dresses and clothes that was found in the attic. !&lt;",

        "text": "This happened about two weeks ago, it left me terrified and I haven’t really felt fine since. Had a very realistic and terrible dream with possible paranormal interference. I can really use some advice and alternative perspectives..\n\nFor context this dream happened two weeks ago. I went to bed close to midnight. In the dream, my wife and were living in an unfamiliar house. It was old, mostly made of wood, and had decorations and furniture which reflected that. Everything was so vibrant and real. There was no narrative to the dream, which is unusual for me, it was like waking life. An invisible energy was taunting us by throwing objects, and physically pushing us. We were both terrified and retreated into the master bedroom. That is when the door started to shake violently, and flew open. I stood in horror  and stared into the empty doorway, and then the invisible energy flew into my body with great force. I felt a surge of powerful energy in my body, it was overwhelming, it felt like thousands of pounds of vibration entered me. I convulsed while standing, and blacked out, losing consciousness completely. \n\nThis is where it got very disturbing for me. \n\nStill in the dream, I regained consciousness and found myself standing close to my wife who was crying and cowering on this weird bed. She seemed scared for me, and kept asking if I was okay. I asked her what happened, but before she answered, the invisible force pushed us both onto the bed and held us there. The gravity weighing us down was so intense, I can barely describe it. The entity whispered something into my ear and then it all ended.\n\nI woke up in real life, in a state of sleep paralysis at 1am. After immense struggle I was able to shake out of it, a similar gravity from before. \n\nI’ve had many scary dreams in my life, but this was profoundly worse. I felt violated, compromised, and very afraid for days to come. For context, I’ve been reading many old, occult books for research purposes before this happened. And a week before this happened I felt the gravity pushing me down on my couch (albeit with much less force than in the dream). \n\nMy therapist dismissed it as entirely related to my OCD. I haven’t told anyone else, nor even my wife because she is very scared by paranormal things. \n\nSince then I threw a religious “kitchen sink” at the situation. Many prayers to archangel Michael, and reciting verses Freon the Bible at night. Nothing extraordinary has happened after, besides my cat being way more vocal and restlesss at night. \n\nIt’s been bothering me alot, please if anyone has any advice it would mean so much to hear it.",

In this experiment I am able to get into a state in which I can see an entire other human realm.    \n\nIt exists all around us.  They are all around us.  All the time.   Like the Djinn. \n\nAnd I've found a way to see them, touch them and communicate with them. \n\nMy experiments have gotten better.    And in my most recent attempt, I went too far. \n\nI would say that, while our realities normally don't overlap at all, I was in a situation where there was 15-20% overlap. \n\nI could see them clearly.  Hear some words.   We were able to laugh gesture, etc.   If I wanted to make good friends there, they would be great allies.    They could easily make a person wealthy beyond imagination. \n\nWhat was different this last time was touch.   I could sense touch and contact.   Mostly it was just subtle pressure.    But twice if felt exactly like skin to skin. \n\nThat's fine except they also have technology.  And it can be used to cause pain. \n\nSome of them used it to cause pain.  I won't get into why.  But it wasn't anything I meant to happen.    I did something they didn't like because I didn't understand the rules. \n\nI will provide an in-depth report soon, but for now I'll say this:   Virtually everyone I've met there is friendly and relatable.    But not all of them, and if you go too far and get too close, which i did, you can find yourself looking for the first quick exit out. \n\nIf you're into this stuff, be careful.    I almost bit it.   And I'm still sick from the devices they used.  As well as I have some retina damage.    \n\nStay clear of this stuff.",
