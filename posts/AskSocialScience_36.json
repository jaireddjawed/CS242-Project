Now, I would guess that both of these numbers are really higher because of under-reporting.\n\nHowever, I want to know how much of the gender disparity of sexual assault is due to the fact that men are probably less likely to say that they were sexually assaulted than women due to gender norms. I'm interested in general in the gender disparity of sexual assault, but it's hard to know without first correcting for under-reporting.\n\nHas there been much research on this you could point me to?\n Also, I don't mean to disparage anybody's experience, sexual assault is awful no matter who the victim is, and we shouldn't be in the game of comparing who has it worse. Also, when I mean under-reporting here, I don't necessarily mean reporting to the authorities, but rather the denial of the action as assault or the refusal to tell somebody that they've been assaulted in general.",

I always assumed conflict theory was a much more macro and Marxist framework that involved things like Engels' observation the families are microcosms of the wider inequality and class conflict present in socio-economic systems. For example, he describes the Neolithic transition from egalitarian hunter-gatherer tribes where property was held in common to the slave society where property ownership was divided between classes as giving birth to gender roles like women being the homemakers by taking care of kids while the men plowed the fields with hoes.\n\nWhich view is correct, or are both correct?

        "text": "So, I feel like I may not have enough information to ask this topic. I've been arguing with someone over what I feel is semantics, which breaks down to the history of capitalism, when it \"began\", and what defines it.\n\nThe person I'm arguing with believes that capitalism is innate. That even under systems like feudalism there were people practicing capitalism.\n\nTheir arguments boil down to a few things so far. Like what defines currency . Currency is a medium of exchange, as opposed to a barter system, but it also has the clause that it is in \"common use\". A lot of this stuff seems to be pretty relative though, anything can be a currency(pretty rocks, rare earth metals, arrowheads etc), and what \"common use\" means seems also pretty relative. They argue that since people used mediums of exchange throughout history, and since those people were voluntarily exchanging private property, that it was in fact capitalism. \n\nSo my main problems with these arguments is that I was under the impression that capitalism had far more narrow defining traits. Things like a competitive market or consistent pricing system would need to be in place. Capitalism couldn't occur under feudalism since, due to how society was run, there couldn't be a competitive market. The societal goal was the wishes of the nobility, not the pursuance of profit. \n\nHowever, are my ideas too narrow about what defines capitalism? I know many socialists think of capitalism as not too different from feudalism for instance. Though in the cases I've read, they argue more about the class power struggle parallels versus something like particular differences in how the economic system functions.\n\nI feel like this was a bit garbled, and I'll admit some of these concepts I'm not that intimately familiar with. This may have a lot of overlap with historical and anthropological perspectives too, so I wasn't sure where to ask it.",

What I'm wondering is, how applicable do psychologists and other relevant social scientists believe Haidt's models are to the real-world, and how much should we rely on them to structure political discourse (as Haidt seems very confident in their effectiveness)?\n\nJust to clarify, I'm aware that *The Righteous Mind* goes into quite a bit of real-world detail, but I'm a bit skeptical of Haidt's use of it in more recent months/years to justify particular social and political beliefs.\n\nThanks in advance.",

You would have thought that at some size a company becomes too big to fail.",

I'm naturally suspicious of experts commenting on matters outside their field (Lakoff is a linguist). I also understand that the overall paradigm Lakoff supports within psychology, embodied cognition, is not universally accepted within that field:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition#Criticisms\n\nWhich is a long way of saying that not everybody in all fields thinks that Lakoff is right, and therefore I am not willing to base my assessment of his conclusions re:politics on glowing reviews in the non-technical press.\n\nSo: do a majority of social scientists believe that Lakoff's word about social science is to be trusted? What, if any, compelling criticisms of his work in this field are there? I'm aware that Pinker criticized \"Whose Freedom?,\" but I'm wondering if anyone else has stepped forward to point out perceived flaws in Lakoff's social science work.",

The full report is here: https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/file_attachments/bp-economy-for-99-percent-160117-en.pdf\n\nI would love knowledgeable inputs on some of these points:\n\n* The stat and the way it is made up (assets minus debt) is not a true reflection of poverty, as people who live well but are in gross debt reflect as 0 or little or negative wealth. Is there any way to look at these stats and not throw it out because well-off people are considered poor by it?\n\n* There are in fact fewer people in abject poverty now than before. Is this a function of capitalism, or a function of human innovation and advances? (We can already dismiss innovation only happens with capitalism since the communist Russia advanced plenty without capitalism and even beat the US in the space race in most things other than getting to the moon).\n\n* What is the case for capitalism? What is the case against capitalism?\n\n* I actually believe pure capitalism is just as bad as pure socialism, (and marxism, communism, anarchism, everything) that society needs to borrow bits from every extreme to create a better balance than it currently is, but probably will never reach equilibrium. But progress towards it is better than none.",

Is there research that investigates if this is a result of misunderstanding what femimism tries to achieve or something else? Is there any research as to how societal perception of feminism has changed over time (and maybe on how it could become so negative)?\n\nI am not necessary interested (just) in American society, everything that deals with Western world countries would be interesting. \n\nThanks for your answers!",

        "text": "The only study I know is featured in IQ and the Wealth of Nations by Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen but it's not reliable:\n&gt;In the 2002 book IQ and the Wealth of Nations, and IQ and Global Inequality in 2006, Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen created estimates of average IQs for 113 nations. They estimated IQs of 79 other nations based on neighboring nations or via other means. They saw a consistent correlation between national development and national IQ averages. They found the highest national IQs among Western and East Asian developed nations and the lowest national IQs in the world's least developed nations in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. In a metaanalysis of studies of IQ estimates in Africa, Wicherts, Dolan &amp; van der Maas (2009), p. 10 concluded that Lynn and Vanhanen had relied on unsystematic methodology by failing to publish their criteria for including or excluding studies. They found that Lynn and Vanhanen's exclusion of studies had depressed their IQ estimate for sub-Saharan Africa, and that including studies excluded in \"IQ and Global Inequality\" resulted in average IQ of 82 for sub-Saharan Africa, lower than the average in Western countries, but higher than Lynn and Vanhanen's estimate of 67. Wicherts at al. conclude that this difference is likely due to sub-Saharan Africa having limited access to modern advances in education, nutrition and health care.[55] A 2010 systematic review by the same research team, along with Jerry S. Carlson, found that compared to American norms, the average IQ of sub-Saharan Africans was about 80. The same review concluded that the Flynn effect had not yet taken hold in sub-Saharan Africa.\nA 2007 meta-analysis by Rindermann found many of the same groupings and correlations found by Lynn and Vanhanen, with the lowest scores in sub-Saharan Africa, and a correlation of .60 between cognitive skill and GDP per capita. Hunt (2010, pp. 437–439) considers Rindermann's analysis to be much more reliable than Lynn and Vanhanen's. By measuring the relationship between educational data and social well-being over time, this study also performed a causal analysis, finding that when nations invest in education this leads to increased well-being later on.[Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence) \n\nand \n\n&gt;Some criticisms have focused on the limited number of studies upon which the book is based. The IQ figures are based on 3 different studies, one study in 34 nations, and two studies in 30 nations. There were actual tests for IQ in 81 nations. For 104 nations there were no IQ studies at all and IQ was estimated based on IQ in surrounding nations.[2] The limited number of participants in some studies has also been criticized. A test of 108 9- to 15-year-olds in Barbados, of 50 13- to 16-year-olds in Colombia, of 104 5- to 17-year-olds in Ecuador, of 129 6- to 12-year-olds in Egypt, and of 48 10- to 14-year-olds in Equatorial Guinea, all were taken as measures of national IQ.

It's almost as if as a part of maturing and developing their own identity they reject and resent everything about their mother and try to be opposite to her. Then as they mature they begin to appreciate and emulate their mother more, even if by accident. This seems to happen whether the mother was a good mother or a bad mother, a good role model or bad. It is referred to as a \"stage\" and seems common enough to be part of a normal maturation process. \n\nDo boys have this same stage or is this more common in girls with the mother?  Boys rebellion against father seems to be more case by case, an event or decision they rebel against because they want to do something they aren't supposed to.  Whereas for women, girls reject nearly everything about their mothers, for a couple years. \n\nI understand some boys do rebel against dad and some girls don't rebel against mom. I'm looking to see if there is evidence to defend that it is far more common in girls than in boys. (or evidence to prove my assumption wrong)\n\nThank you",

Thank you for the answers in advance.\n\nBut, as I said in my previous post, I know victims of such abuse in the 1950's to 70's, generations older than me, who were victims of abuse, and they are adamant that such things were never discussed in public, and it was virtually impossible to prosecute such perpetrators. \n\nRegrettably, while it may have been true for them, I reject that notion out of hand that simply no one was even prosecuted/brought to account.  I understand then there were a lot of hurdles to cross, and it was scandalous to even mention such actions openly, but surely there were people who were morally outraged by such actions, and dared defied then social norms and did try to pursue it.\n\nHow often did such prosecutions occur, and then what were the consequences for the perpetrators?  I do understand the victims may have been ostracized, but those who were brave enough to overcome that, testify against their abuser, and defy social norms at the time, what would they have expected to occur?\n\nThank you for indulging me in this long post, and I do appreciate the answers given.  Again, this is a touchy subject, but I am curious as to how people could be just so out of touch for the most part, and fearful to speak out then, but I'm interested in those brave ones who were the catalyst to overcome such social norms of the day.  Thank you.\n\nEdit: I debated at length were to post this follow-up.  I tried at r/NoStupidQuestions, which is normally good for everyday answers, but I didn't get any, and it's normally not an academic sub.  r/LegalAdvice doesn't allow hypothetical questions, and r/AskHistorians doesn't allow for example seeking questions, so here it is.",

I'm also looking for purely in the first world/America because they accept it works in developing countries. But they think that most people in the developed world already have enough information.",

Finding think tank work? Want to learn about natural language processing? Have a question about the academic applications of Marxian theories or social network analysis? The history of a theory? This is the place!\n\nLike our other feature threads (Monday Reading and Research and Friday Free-For-All), this thread will be lightly moderated as long as it stays broadly on topics tangentially related to academic or professional social science.\n",

        "text": "If you look at low income areas in the US, poor people are stuck in an education based feedback loop.  So, here's what I hear from the right: that the liberal solution would be affirmative action or throwing more money at the schools, and the conservative solution would be bringing more money into the area so that they could fund themselves.\n\nOne example (apparently?) is if you look at Washington DC, especially the area around South Capitol street. Ten, fifteen years ago it was the height of the ghetto, people got shot regularly and cops would not venture there alone.\n\nNationals stadium has been built there lately, however, and now money is flowing through the area. There are trendy bars popping up, new people moving in, and the locals that have always been there are getting much better schools and graduations and college rates are skyrocketing. People who wanted to move out a decade ago are now fighting to stay (the city is pushing some stupid zoning rules) which is driving property prices up too.\n\nIs this an outlier or a good example of, well, not quite an individual solution, but its not a \"government forcing the solution\" solution either.",
