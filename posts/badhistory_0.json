        "text": "Greetings r/badhistory. Once again, one of the resident Byzantinists has come to whine about people being incorrect on the internet.\n\n\nSo, EU4. Fun game, even if I largely play it modded [Mods that add more depth and unique Roman/Byzantine mechanics, my beloved…]. \n\nAnyway, recently they’ve been putting out dev diaries for their new updates that are coming. One of these was an update for the Ottomans. In the process the Cannons of Mehmed were mentioned, and how Ottomans get cannons via an event earlier than everyone else, but given that they don’t have the mil tech that gives said cannons damage, they can only use them in the siege. This being to reflect how the guns were siege weapons, not really battlefield weapons per se like later developments.\n\n\nAnyway, in the comments on the relevant reddit thread about this in \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/10k653q/development_diary_24th_of_january_2023_the/\n\n, there’s a section where a people discuss the effectiveness of the guns. One user mentions 'the real reason the Otters were able to take Constantinople as easily as they did was because retreating Genevan defenders didn't get a gate shut in time.', only for a Turkish user [as per their flair] to argue instead that 'the walls were destroyed, the gate thing is a legend.'\n\n\nThey are incorrect.\n\n\nBut given that this is the internet and anyone can spew any nonsense without a source, I’m obviously going to give evidence as to why they are incorrect. Both secondary and primary sources.\n\n\nFirst off, we go with a secondary source. Johnathan Harris's *Constantinople: Capital of Byzantium*\n\n\n&gt; ‘These large cannon did not deliver an instant victory to the sultan. They were fairly crude devices and so difficult to load that they could only be fired seven times a day. The defenders were also able to repair the breaches that the flying stones had made, using mounds of earth and branches. These ad hod defences provided surprisingly effective, for the cannon could do little damage to them: their stones merely embedded themselves harmlessly in the soft earth’.  ^1\n\n&gt; ‘Mehmed II launched his final attack on the late evening of 28 May, concentrating the assault on the badly damaged section of the Land Walls between the Gate of Adrianople and the Gate of St Romanos. Although they were heavily outnumbered, the Byzantines, Genoese and Venetians fought valiantly and wave after wave of attackers were beaten off so that, by the early hours of 29 May, there was still no sign of an Ottoman Victory. Then, when the fighter was still raging fiercely, the Genoese commander, Giovanni Giustiniani, was hit by an arrow or crossbow bolt. He retired from the scene to seek treatment even though Emperor Constantine begged him to stay. Their charismatic leader gone, the defenders wavered [….] some of Mehmed’s elite Janissary troops found a small sally port that had been left open by the defenders to make it easier for them to pass between the inner and outer walls. The janissaries slipped through and got themselves up onto the Blachernae battlements. Discovering that the enemy was not both behind and above them, many of the defending troops on the outer wall panicked and fled through the gate of St. Romanos. By dawn, Ottoman soldiers were pouring into the city and many of the surviving defenders were making for the Golden Horn in a last attempt to escape by ship. There were some who remained on the Land walls and fought on bravely till they were hacked down. Among them was Emperor Constantinople XI, the last of the line from Constantine the Great. No one knows where he was buried, if he was at all.’  ^2\n\n\nFrom this overview provided by Jonathan Harris, we can see that the claims that 'the walls were destroyed', are simply incorrect. The cannons did damage the walls, and cause sections to crumble, but these breaches were quickly reinforced, and the Ottomans were not able to break into the city proper till they had found an undefended gate, or sally port, to use to outflank the defenders and cause a route of those stations on the outer walls.\n\n\nBut it would be remiss of us to solely use a secondary source here. After all, one could, albeit incorrectly, claim that Harris is leaving out details or only using sources that support his narrative. Because this is the internet and people are more likely to make up reasons as to why your source doesn’t count than they are to actually admit they are wrong. So to the primary sources we go.\n\n\nThe first of these is the account of Nicolo Barbaro. He was a Venetian, a surgeon who was in the city during the siege and who later wrote up his account of that experience. He attributes a lot of the defences, ideas and help done by the Genoese to Venetians and tries to make the Venetian defenders be the doomed heroes of the whole siege.\n\n\n&gt; ‘On this day, the twenty-first of April, there was a continuous bombardment all day of the walls by San [Saint] Ramano [Romanos], and a tower was razed to the ground by the bombardment, with several yards of wall. […]  Now that such a great part of the wall was destroyed by the bombardment […] Venetian gentlemen, who were much more full of spirit than the Greeks [Romans] were, and the Venetians set about making good and strong repairs where they were needed at the broken walls. These repairs were made with barrels filled with stones and earth, and behind them there was made a very wide ditch with a dam at the end of it, which was covered with strips of vine and other layers of branches drenched with water to make them solid, so that it was as strong as the wall had been.’ ^3 \n\n\n&gt; […]\n\n\n&gt; ‘One hour before daybreak [29th of May] the Sultan had his great cannon fired, and the shot landed in the repairs which we had made and knocked them down to the ground. Nothing could be seen for the smoke made by the cannon, and the Turks came on under the cover of the smoke, and about three hundred of them got inside the barbicans. The Greeks [Romans] and Venetians fought hard and drove them out of the barbicans, and a great number died […] But after being driven back from the barbicans the Turks again fired their great cannon, and the pagans like hounds came on behind like the smoke of the cannon, raging and pressing on each other like wild beasts, so that in the space of quarter of an hour there were more than thirty thousand Turks inside the barbicans, with such cries that it seemed a very inferno, and the shouting was heard as far away as Anatolia. When the Turks got inside the barbicans, they quickly captured the first row of them, but before they managed this, a great number of them died […] Seeing this, Zuan Zustignan [Giovanni Giustiniani], that Genoese of Genoa, decided to abandon his post. The Emperor had made these Zuan Zustignan [Giovanni Giustiniani] the captain of his forces, and as he fled, he went through the city crying ‘The Turks have got into the city!’. But he lied in his teeth, because the Turks were not yet inside. When the people heard their captain’s words, that the Turks had got into the city, they all abandoned their posts at once and went rushing towards the harbour in the hope of escaping in the ships and galleys.’  ^4\n\n\nSo, what does this account tell us? Firstly, that part of the walls were destroyed, but were then repaired in an ad hoc manner by Venetians. The Turkish cannon fire on the 29th was able to breach the defences and allow the Turks in, but the defence didn’t fail till the Genoese Commander deserted his post. This seems to support the claim that 'the walls were destroyed'.. However, this is not the only primary source we have to look at.\n\n\nThe 2nd account is that of the Florentine Giacomo Tedaldi, whose account was likely transcribed following his evacuation to Negropont following the siege, on the 31 of December, 1453 by a Jean Columbi.  ^5\n\n&gt; ‘The assault began [28 of May] and the defenders gave a good account of themselves at all points. The gate of Saint Romanus was the most vulnerable place, and the wall here was weakest, since the Turks had previously broken down a great part of it. The cannon had been placed there, and they had razed a tower and the upper half of the wall for a distance of at least two hundred brasses. […] \n\n&gt; Meanwhile the defenders were plugging the cavities in the wall, filling the two hundred brasses which had been destroyed with barrels and earth and other materials, and resisting the attack to the best of their ability. […] Guistiniani was wounded by a culverin, so he left to seek the attention of a surgeon. Before doing so, he entrusted the guarding of his post to two Genoese gentlemen. All this time, the Turks were scaling the wall more and more, and at this, the soldiers who were guarding it inside, and seeing them already inside the wall in such great numbers, and Guistiniani going away, believed that he was fleeing, so they abandoned their posts and fled too. By these means the Turks entered Constantinople at dawn on the twenty-nineth of May.’   ^ 6\n\nThis account, in contrast to that of Nicolo Barbaro, doesn't accuse Guistiniani of fleeing, and further reinforces the point about the damage to the walls being repaired. It’s not that surprising, given that, as a Florentine, Giacomo Tedaldi had less of a reason to try and shit talk Genoese than a Venetian did.\n\n\nThe 3rd account that we’re looking at is that of Leonard of Chios, the Latin Archbishop of Mytilene, and eyewitness to the siege who sent a letter about the conquest of Constantinople to People Nicholas V in Rome by August 16 1453.  ^7\n\n\n&gt; ‘They then placed a terrible cannon (an even larger one, which had burst, could barely be moved by a hundred and fifty yoke of oxen) near that part of the single wall, called Caligaria, which was not protected by ditches or breastwork. It fired a stone which measured eleven of my palms in circumference. With this they battered the wall, and although it was extremely thick and strong, it nevertheless gave way under the onslaught of this terrible machine.’   ^8\n\n&gt; […]\n\n&gt; ‘He [Giovanni Giustiniani] was taken into the pay of the Emperor and put in charge of the military side of the defence. He made it clear at once to the enemy that the city was being vigorously defenced, and paid great attention to repairing the walls which had been damaged, so that he seemed to be mocking the Sultan’s efforts: whenever the weight of the huge stone brought down the walls, he, nothing daunted, repaired them with faggots and earth and barrels piled together. Because of this, the Sultan, feeling that he was being ridiculed, decided to continue battering the walls with his cannon. […] Since their great cannon had not succeeded in demolishing the walls by Caligaria because of the energy with which the repairs had been carried out, it was moved to another place by the Bactatinean Tower, near the gate of Saint Romanus. There it hurled its shot weighting, it is estimated, twelve hundred pounds, all day long, which shook the target to the foundations and finally destroyed it. The ruins of the tower filled the foss to the op, and it was clear that a way had been opened for the enemy to break in. If repairs had not been effected with great haste, as had happened when the wall was broken down at Caligaria, they would have certainly been able to force their way into the city.’  ^9\n\n&gt; […]\n\n&gt; ‘Giovanni Giustiniani was struck by an arrow in the armpit. Like a boy unused to war, he trembled at the sight of his own blood and feared for his life. In order to not dishearten his soldiers, who did not yet know that he had been wounded, he left the ranks with the intention of seeking a physician in secret. If he had appointed a substitute to take his place, the city would not have been lost. The battle was still raging furiously, when the Emperor noticed that Giustiniani was missing, and went in great distress to see where he had gone. When our soldiers saw they were without a leader, they began to retreat from their positions. […] Our soldiers therefore began to feel weariness overcoming them, and treated for a moment under the pressure of the enemy’s attack from the Bachaturean wall, which they had repaired. When the Turks saw this, they decided that it was possible to cross on the level, because the ruins of the wall had filled in the ditch. […] Giustiniani , forgetting where his glory and his salvation lay, now showed a cowardice so great that it can be compared only to the high mettle that he had displayed before this time. If he had any manhood in him, he should not have retreated, as long as he could bear the pain of his wound […] because of this, the morale of our soldiers was weakened, and they followed their captain as he fled, hoping to save themselves. ‘Give the key of the gate’, Giustiniani cried, ‘to my followers,’ and as soon as it was unlocked they were packed together in a mass in their efforts to get through it. […] Then the Turks overran the rest of the outer wall, from the top of which they aimed stones at any of us who were within range.’  ^10\n\n\n\nAgain, we’re seeing that the damage caused by the Turkish cannons to the wall don’t smash the way open. They’re repaired and it’s the assault on the section held by Genoese and Roman troops that lets them burst into the city, after Giustiniani is forced to withdraw after being wounded. It’s a bit rich for Leonard, a bishop, to accuse Giustiniani of being a coward for retreating after being shot and feels more like he wants to find a scapegoat for the whole affair. No shit someone goes to get medical attention after being shot by an arrow.\n\n\nThe 4th account that we’re looking at is a letter written by the former Genoese Podesta of the colony at Pera, across the Golden Horn. In this, Angelo Giovanni Lomellino, who was present at the time of the siege, was describing the events to his brother.  ^11\n\n\n&gt; ‘You will have heard by now, I am sure, of the unexpected fate of Constantinople, captured by the Turkish Sultan on the twenty-ninth of last month, a day which we longed for, because it seemed that our victory was assured. The Sultan attacked from all sides throughout the night. As morning came, Giovanni Giustiniani received a [gap in the text] and left his gate, and went towards the sea, and by the same gate the Turks entered, finding no resistance, and this was the end of it.’  ^12\n\n\nOnce again, we see another claim of the Turks breaching in through the gate, as opposed to battering down the walls with cannons and storming into the city that way.\n\n\nThe 5th account is different to the others. It’s still a primary source, but it’s not an eyewitness account. It’s from the Turkish History, ten books that cover the period of 1298-1463, written by Laonicus Chalcocondylas, an Athenian.  ^13\n\n\n&gt; ‘For the next forty days the Turkish cannon battered the outer wall and brought down a great part of it, four tower with all their superstructure, and caused damage to the great inner wall and its towers. […] As to the wall which had been damaged by the Sultan’s cannon, they repaired it with great speed at night, making a barrier with ladders and wooden barrels.  ^14\n\n&gt; […]\n\n\n&gt; Giustiniani himself was wounded in the arm by a shot from a cannon, and some of his men were also wounded, and left their positions. The Turks followed up their advantage, and attacked and slew them. Meanwhile, Giustiniani was withdrawing, with his soldiers following, and the janissaries pressing hard upon them. Then the Emperor, when he saw them leaving their position, and giving up the fight, rant to the place and asked Giustiniani where he was going. ‘By the way which God has shown to the Turks’, was the reply. […] When the rest of the Greeks [Romans] saw the janssaries running to the great wall, and firing arrows and stones at them from above, while Giustiniani and his men were fleeing, they too turned to run as soon as the janissaries attacked them.’  ^15\n\n\nAgain, we’re seeing that the walls were damaged, yet able to be repaired, and that the main assault that broke into the city happens by the gates where the Genoese and the Emperor were stationed, with the defence crumbling under the Turkish assault when Genoese elements withdraw. \n\nThe 6th account is, once again, a primary source that’s not an eyewitness account. It’s from the Byzantine History of Michael Ducas, composed some years after the siege.  ^16\n\n\n&gt; ‘Two sections of wall with a tower in the middle collapsed, and the tower by the gate of Saint Romanus was also left lying on the ground, so that besiegers and besieged were left looking at one another. \n\n&gt; […] \n\n&gt; Giustiniani continued to exert himself all through the night, ordering all the brushwood in the city to be brought to plug the gap in the wall, and having another ditch dug on the inside to protect the part where it had been destroyed. […] There were some older men who knew of a side entrance which for many years had been securely blocked up, giving access below ground level to the lower part of the palace. They told the Emperor of this, and by his command it was opened up. Then, protected by the walls which were still sound, they made a sortie from this , and fought the Turks in the outer enclosure; the name of this hidden gate had originally been the Kerkoporta.   ^17\n\n&gt; […]\n\n&gt; He [Giustiniani] was struck by a shot in the back of the arm, above the elbow, while it was still dark. […] He cried to the Emperor, ‘Stand fast, while I go to my ship, and when I have found a surgeon to attend to me, I shall soon return.’ […] The Emperor saw Giustiniani withdrawing, and he and those fighting with him were frightened, since they were already hard put to it to hold their own. The Turks had been working their way gradually towards the walls, protected themselves with their shields and putting scaling ladders in place. But they had gained nothing by this, because the slingers from above kept them off with stones , and they were thwarted in their attempt. The Emperor and all his Greek [Roman] troops were concentrated at that point against the enemy, and all their energies were directed towards one purpose, to prevent the Turks from entering through the breach in the wall. But God, who willed it otherwise, brought the enemy in by another way without their knowledge. The Turks saw the gate which had been previously mentioned was left open, and about fifty of the Sultan’s janissaries leaped inside it, and then made their way up to the top of the walls, breathing fire and slaying all those who opposed them, until they dashed against the slingers on the ramparts. What happened then was the sight to make one shudder. Some of the Greeks [Romans] and Latins who were preventing the enemy from bringing their ladders up to the walls were cut down by janissaries. […] Then the Turks were able to set up their scaling ladders without opposition and swarm up them like eagles in flight.\n\n&gt; The Greeks [Romans] who were with the Emperor did not know what had happened, because the point at which the Turks had entered was some distance away, and because their attention was fully engaged by their immediate opponents. There were twenty Turkish soldiers for every Greek [Roman] […] Then suddenly they noticed missiles falling on them from above and killing some of them, and looking up, they saw Turks on the wall. Their immediate reaction was to turn and flee into the city. But they could not all pass through the gate called Charisius, being in a tightly-packed throng, and those who were stronger succeeded in making their way forward by trampling over their weaker brethren.  ^18\n\n\nAgain, we’re seeing that while the walls are damaged, and in some sections brought down by cannon fire, the Turks can’t use the gap to storm into the city. Instead, some of them breach in through a gateway, clear missile infantry from the top and allow for the scaling of the walls. This account doesn’t outright blame Giustiniani getting injured and withdrawing. Though there is the implication of it with the gate being left unguarded after his retreat.\n\n\nThere are other accounts I count mention, such as the Chronicon of George Phrantzes/Sphrantzes. He was an eyewitness to the events of the siege of Constantinople, but didn’t write his account till far later in his life. However, he spends a lot time blaming Serbians, Venetians etc etc for not giving the Romans more aid and is extremely lacking in actual details for the siege itself. And I don’t have a copy of his work laying around so…yeah. \n\nRegardless, we're not getting the EU4 style 'press button make hole in wall and win siege'. The walls weren't completely destroyed, and were still able to repel Ottoman forces. It wasn't till the elite of the Ottoman army engaged, and the Genoese are the gatehouse started to fall back that the Ottomans were able to break into the city and the defence crumbled.\n\nImo, EU4 doesn't really help with how it uses/shows cannons. Normally cannons just *boost the progress* of the siege, simulating it slowly wearing down the defenders over time by wittling away the defences.\n\nBut you can also spend mana points to make said cannons delete part of the wall to rapidly speed up the siege too. And the latter fits the popular conception of 'early cannons just delete walls'.\n\n\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\n1) Jonathan Harris, *Constantinople: Capital of Byzantium*, 2nd edn (New York: Bloomsbury Academic, 2017), p. 192.\n\n\n2) Harris, *Constantinople*, p. 193.\n\n\n3) Nicolò Barbaro, *Diary of the Siege of Constantinople, 1453*, trans. by J.

        "text": "Hello r/badhistory readers.  Today, I will be covering friend of the subreddit Whatifalthist (WIAH) and documenting his ruminations on the left in his video: How Envy Drives Society, History and the Left.  Specifically, what the self-described historian thinks is the primary cause of social justice movements: envy.  He attempts to leverage history to buttress his points but how well do they hold up to scrutiny?  Well, in this post, I will be covering a section of his video: Social Justice and Envy.  I will not be covering contemporary politics, including current social movements.  Instead, I will explain the historical limitations of his arguments, the political context of WIAH’s statements and their implications on how we analyze history.  So, who’s ready to begin?  \n\nLink to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exCcz6uLbw8\n\n&gt;[22:14]Although in a lot of ways Black people have been really mistreated by the American system, we have to remember that Asians faced some really bad discrimination like being forbidden to immigrate to America, forbidden to bring their wives over, to own land, work in most occupations and don’t forget Japanese Americans who were interned and had their businesses confiscated in WW2.  \n\n&gt;The thing we forget here is that Asians in a lot of ways faced legal discrimination as bad if not worse than black people in the 20th century.  However, due to advantages in cultural capital Asians and Hispanics have done better than blacks and indigenous people.  Although discrimination is, surely is a factor, you can’t mark all inequities up to it.  Just look at different subgroups of black people of wildly fluctuating incomes.  African Americans of West Indian immigrant ancestry are significantly wealthier than those of native black ancestry.  Alternatively black people’s ancestors [who] were freed before the Civil War have consistently been 50 years ahead of black people with slave ancestors and stuff like education, money and the like.  With the term BIPOC the fact is that we aren’t celebrating a success of the Asian and Hispanic community but instead focusing just on the continued oppression of the black and indigenous which precludes any explanation except envy. \n\nSo we can see here that WIAH intends to use the model minority concept to disparage what he considers to be the social justice movement’s analysis of racism.  There are multiple issues with his arguments.  The first is his claim “you can’t mark all inequities up to discrimination”.  There are material reasons behind the varying experiences of different groups that this argument ignores.  During the Great Migrations, millions of black Americans moved to Northern and Western cities, where they faced housing discrimination and redlining, among other things.^14  Along with this community disinvestment and segregation, as a speaker for the New York: A Documentary Film stated, many black Americans moved to Northern cities just as manufacturing started to decline.^12  The unionized manufacturing jobs that helped establish a degree of financial security for earlier American immigrants disappeared as black Americans and other newer immigrants moved to these manufacturing cities.  The Hart Cellar Act of 1965 also dramatically altered US immigration.  Before America passed stringent anti-Asian immigration laws, Asian immigrants were generally low-skilled laborers.^6  The Asian immigrants after 1965 were significantly wealthier and settled disproportionately in the growing West Coast and Sunbelt metros.^6  At the same time, mass incarceration drastically affected black Americans; no other racial group has 1 out of every 3 males incarcerated in their lifetime.^1  Even though WIAH does illustrate the socioeconomic heterogeneity among black Americans in this section, his explanation is not really useful for explaining how this heterogeneity historically developed.  He doesn’t explain why West Indians have higher incomes than “native” black Americans or why the descendents of black freedmen are wealthier than those of black slaves.  Or what his sources are for these claims.  By refusing to back his broad claims on discrimination with substantive evidence, WIAH limits the appeal of his arguments to people who already support them, creating a quasi-echo chamber community.  \n\nNot only do we see WIAH pitting Asians against black Americans when he states both groups have experienced significant legal discrimination while noting Asians are doing better socioeconomically, he also homogenizes the experiences of Asian and Hispanic Americans. Amongst these broad racial groups are historic socioeconomic differences.  Readers may recall [my post on WIAH asking if Western Civilization was committing suicide](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/wk4m1u/is_western_civilization_commiting_suicide/) where I discussed a Chinatown garment strike by Asian women at a time when Asian immigrants overall were significantly wealthier.  Were these Asian women financially benefiting from this “cultural capital”?  If anything, the women were not benefitting from capital, of a different sort, held by the Chinese garment owners who opposed the strikes.  Likewise, I also discussed in the same post the Farah strike of Chicanas from El Paso in the 1970s, another reflection of the limitations of WIAH’s “cultural capital” argument given the poor wages faced by thousands of Chicana workers.  It seems quite arbitrary that he stated Asians and Hispanics had “cultural capital” that black and Native Americans lacked given the YouTuber does not state what metrics, if any, he is using.  Both black and Native Americans have extensive cultural institutions, including black churches^10 and tribal nations,^2,9 respectively  However, as WIAH notably did not mention, “cultural capital” is affected by the material conditions of our class society.  A stark example of this is the history of American Indians, where forced removals, slavery and warfare decimated both Indian populations as well as their culture.^2,9  Genocide makes it difficult to build “cultural capital” when people want your land, labor, and/or you and your culture to die, especially if this is happening for centuries.  \n\nSo, when we look at the history, it seems WIAH’s argument is really only useful as a weapon against black Americans and Amerindians, essentially telling them to shut up about the discrimination they experienced and they should be more like the model minorities.  But this doesn’t jive with the history of discrimination in the US.  Neither discrimination nor poverty ended in the 1960s; the history of postwar America has been shaped by housing segregation,^14 deindustrialization, stagnating wages^17, etc.  It should be frankly unsurprising that WIAH does not discuss economic history in this section, given he argued in another video that people opposed to offshoring are envious.  The YouTuber seems unable or unwilling to recognize the material impacts of economic trends on the working class.  He believes, as he stated [in his video on Classical Civilizations](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/rtaltu/you_really_cant_have_a_democracy_based_upon/), that the interests of the lower classes harm the “long term position” of societies.  Thus, it makes sense WIAH would claim that socioeconomic differences between groups can be explained through “cultural” differences, since he avoids critiquing our current economic system.  However, as we can see through deindustrialization, housing segregation and stagnating wages, the differences we see between racial and class groups can be attributed to specific economic reasons.  Since the aforementioned economic trends have been occurring for decades, it would be unfounded to argue about upper class interests “advancing” society when it seems for most people in society, this is not the case.  \n\n&gt;[25:02] We should also view the hatred of historical figures as an envy for the past.  In real, objective terms what has our generation accomplished in comparison to our forefathers?  They won the World Wars, ended disease and real grinding poverty, reached the moon, ended slavery.  Did actual legal changes with discrimination.  Tamed thousands of miles of wilderness and beat tyrannies.  When we tear down the statues of figures like Churchill, write histories about dead white males or cut Shakespeare out of the curriculum, we enviously destroy their memories that we don’t have to think about them and how we don’t hold up.\n\nI love the idea that people tearing down Winston Churchill statues are jealous of the man who was a major contributor to the Bengal Famine of 1943 and sent London police to deal with the 1910-1911 Miners’ Strike in Wales^15.  There certainly is enough about Churchill to criticize, especially with regards to whether or not there should be statues glorifying him.  His accomplishments as the UK’s primary WWII leader and creating [workers’ health insurance in 1911](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Insurance_Act_1911) don’t negate Churchill and the war cabinet’s prioritization of Britain’s postwar stockpile and Mediterranean and Southeast Asian military objectives over the needs of starving Bengalis.^5,13,16 They also don’t negate Churchill’s racist views on Indians that continued as the Bengal Famine occurred^3 or his strong opposition to Indian Independence.^4  It’s videos like WIAH’s that assume people must be envious about Churchill which disappoint me.  Churchill’s biography includes his involvement in major historical events like the Bengal Famine that would reasonably cause a reevaluation of our assessment of the man.  Instead, the YouTuber shuts down any historical analysis by assuming Churchill’s detractors are being controlled by their negative emotions.\n\nHis statements on what our forefathers accomplished also leave more questions than they answer.  When did “real grinding poverty” end and what does he consider to be “real” poverty?  Would WIAH consider efforts by New York for example to renovate and build hundreds of thousands of housing units in inner city neighborhoods to be ending “real” poverty?  Because this program continued until at least 2000.^8  What does “tame the wilderness” mean to him and does he assume Amerindians barely existed during the timeframe of US colonization?  Would the Black Panthers’ free breakfast program count as ending discrimination and poverty?^11  Probably not given the Black Panthers’ political leanings and his emphasis on legal changes.  His emphasis on “real, legal changes” is reminiscent of Martin Luther King (MLK) Jr.’s Letter from a Birmingham Jail when he accused white moderates of prioritizing process over substantive change.^7  And naturally WIAH included a photo of MLK in this section…\nSo what we have is essentially create your own history where you insist your political opponents’ actions stem from negative emotions.  Which I can do too: right wingers want to tear down Vladmir Lenin statues because they are jealous about Lenin’s ability to conduct a successful revolution, defend against many imperial powers and uplift millions of poor, starving Russians.  They realize they’ll never live up to Lenin’s greatness!  It has as much evidentiary basis as WIAH’s claims and shows the pitfalls of making claims at whim.  There’s little connection to our material reality, only the ideologically warped one in our minds.  And with the YouTube algorithm already primed to recommend his videos to right-wingers who will often support his claims, the self-described historian can maintain a healthy audience base.  Because with channels like Prager U and WIAH, the goal isn’t really to discuss history, but spin a political yarn using “history” as the fabric.  History conveniently already supports their political beliefs, especially when they disregard any evidence that could contradict their ideology!\nWe don’t need to be too scared to analyze history because of how it might affect our political beliefs.  We want to know the truth, what happened throughout history and what we can learn from it, right?  It’s ok to adjust our beliefs based on our growing understanding of the evidence.  Unfortunately, it appears that content creators like WIAH, even if he describes himself as a historian, are much more invested in the political ideology they support than history.  We need to be aware of this because it is unlikely he will change his positions based on being presented historical evidence, especially given how dismissive he is to his political opponents.  Learning what makes “history” YouTubers tick is an important first step in determining how we deal with badhistory proliferation on the internet and how we dissuade people not already ideologically invested from joining WIAH’s maelstrom of pseudohistory and self-flagellation.\n\nSources:\n\n1 A Brief History of Civil Rights in the United States: The War on Drugs and Mass Incarceration by Howard University\nhttps://library.law.howard.edu/civilrightshistory/blackrights/massincarceration\n\n2 Beyond Germs: Native Depopulation in North America by Catherine M.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/11e19yk/a_badhistory_review_ancient_history_guy_gets/",
        "text": "Hello, those of r/badhistory! Today I am reviewing a video called 'Why Did The Persian Not Adapt To Fight The Greeks?', produced by a Youtube channel called Ancient History Guy:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiGt6RL8gjk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiGt6RL8gjk)\n\nMy sources are ready, so lets begin!\n\n1.31 to 1.49: The narrators says that many of the classical ancient Persian units were very lightly armored, that this was because they practiced a mobile form of warfare. This generalizes Achaemenid tactics, and makes the audience believe they had only one style of fighting. The Achaemenids could engage in mobile warfare and skirmishing, but pitched battles were a central part of their military doctrine, and their core infantry were designed to hold their ground. At the Battle of Platea in 479 BC, Persian foot-soldiers arrayed themselves in close order behind a shield war, and at the Battle of Cunaxa both the Persian ruler, Artaxerxes II, and the usurper, Cyrus the Younger, confronted one another in a stand-up melee.  \n\nThe narrator then goes on to state that  Persian sparabara (spearmen) only wore a padded vest as a form of protection. This is contradicted by primary sources, as well as archaeology. To begin with, Herodotus describes the equipment of Persian infantry:\n\n‘Now those who served were as follows:—The Persians with this equipment:—about their heads they had soft felt caps called *tiaras*, and about their body tunics of various colours with sleeves, presenting the appearance of iron scales like those of a fish, and about the legs trousers; and instead of the ordinary shields they had shields of wicker-work, under which hung quivers; and they had short spears and large bows and arrows of reed, and moreover daggers hanging by the right thigh from the girdle ‘\n\nThe reference to ‘ iron scales like those of a fish’, describes the metal armor they were wearing. This is pretty far from being ‘lightly armored.’ Similarly, such iron scales were discovered during excavations at Persepolis, one of the Achaemenid royal capitals. Greek vases also show Persian soldiers wearing armor similar to the linothorax:\n\n[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Classical\\_calyx-krater\\_ARV\\_extra\\_-\\_Persian\\_archer\\_-\\_Greek\\_soldier\\_fighting\\_Persian\\_archer\\_%2801%29.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Classical_calyx-krater_ARV_extra_-_Persian_archer_-_Greek_soldier_fighting_Persian_archer_%2801%29.jpg)\n\nThe claim is thus clearly wrong. In addition, the narrator also says that another form of Persian soldier, the takabara (taka refers to the type of shield they had), did not even wear padded armor. Yet we also have artwork which shows Persian infantry with both a taka shield and a cuirass:\n\n[http://images.perseus.tufts.edu/images/1992.08.1/1992.08.0068](http://images.perseus.tufts.edu/images/1992.08.1/1992.08.0068)\n\nThere is also artwork showing such warriors without armor as well, but the assertion by the narrator was all-encompassing, which as not the case at all.\n\n1.51: The narrator states that, when forced onto smaller battlefields, the Persians were unable to carry about the maneuvers that won them their huge Empire. For this they use the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC as an example. I feel this is unfair as most armies in the period would have had trouble fighting in such constrained circumstances. Alexander the Overwanked had his first assault at the Battle of the Persian Gate in 330 BC fail because of the terrain, and his troops were forced to withdraw. Yet we would not use this to suggest the Macedonian army had major flaws. The example of Thermopylae is also a poor one because the Persians did in fact carry out an outflanking maneuver to win the engagement.\n\n3.04: The narrator says Cyrus the Younger had a self-imposed trait of never telling a lie. This idea has its basis in the Anabasis, by Xenophon:\n\n‘After he had been sent down by his father to be satrap of Lydia and Great Phrygia and Cappadocia, and had been appointed general of the forces, whose business it is to muster in the plain of the Castolus, nothing was more noticeable in his conduct than the importance which he attached to the faithful fulfilment of every treaty or compact or undertaking entered into with others. He would tell no lies to any one.’\n\nThe narrator demonstrates a complete lack of critical analysis by taking this at face value. An important part of studying primary sources is to understand that the authors themselves were not objective. They might have intentionally or unintentionally let their biases influence what they wrote, passed on rumor as fact, or could only draw on a limited array of information and perspectives. It might be the case that Xenophon was trying to explain away the failure of the Greek mercenaries (they did not play a decisive role in the Battle of Cunaxa and were forced to withdraw from Persian territory) by presenting the decision to march with Cyrus not an as error in strategic judgment, but because he was a just and fair individual. Secondly, they do not bother to compare the description of Cyrus’ character with his actions in the Anabasis. Xenophon says (with italics added by me):\n\nMoreover Cyrus's behaviour towards all who came to him from the king's court was such that, when he sent them away again, they were better friends to himself than to the king his brother. Nor did he neglect the barbarians in his own service; but trained them, at once to be capable as warriors and devoted adherents of himself. Lastly, he began collecting his Hellenic armament, *but with the utmost secrecy, so that he might take the king as far as might be at unawares.*\n\nThe manner in which he contrived the levying of the troops was as follows: First, he sent orders to the commandants of garrisons in the cities (so held by him), bidding them to get together as large a body of picked Peloponnesian troops as they severally were able, *on the plea that Tissaphernes was plotting against their cities;* and truly these cities of Ionia had originally belonged to Tissaphernes, being given to him by the king; but at this time, with the exception of Miletus, they had all revolted to Cyrus. In Miletus, Tissaphernes, having become aware of similar designs, had forestalled the conspirators by putting some to death and banishing the remainder. Cyrus, on his side, welcomed these fugitives, and having collected an army, laid siege to Miletus by sea and land, endeavouring to reinstate the exiles; and *this gave him another pretext for collecting an armament*. At the same time he sent to the king, and claimed, as being the king's brother, that these cities should be given to himself rather than that Tissaphernes should continue to govern them; and in furtherance of this end, the queen, his mother, co-operated with him, *so that the king not only failed to see the design against himself, but concluded that Cyrus was spending his money on armaments in order to make war on Tissaphernes.* Nor did it pain him greatly to see the two at war together, and the less so because Cyrus was careful to remit the tribute due to the king from the cities which belonged to Tissaphernes.’\n\nFor someone who did not lie, there was certainly a lot of deception going on. Cyrus levied troops for falsified reasons, raised others in secret, and generally misled Artaxerxes II. If Xenophon is accurate in his account of the course of these events, then it clearly proves Cyrus was not honest at all. The audience would believe that what the narrator was saying was true and undisputed, which would mean the video would miseducate them, rather than providing an accurate understanding.\n\n3.43: MORE CONJECTURE PRESENTED AS FACT!\n\n3.50: MORE INACCURATE CLAIMS ABOUT THE PERSIANS ONLY HAVING LIGHT INFANTRY!\n\n4.05: The narrator says Cyrus gradually developed some of the first armored cavalry in the ancient world. Hahahaha no. Persian cavalry were already armored before this. Herodotus describes them as being equipped with metal armor and helmets. The commander of the Persian cavalry at Plataea, Masistios, wore protection that made him almost immune to Greek spear thrusts:\n\n‘The horse of Masistios, going in advance of the rest, was struck in the side by an arrow, and feeling pain he reared upright and threw Masistios off; and when he had fallen, the Athenians forthwith pressed upon him; and his horse they took and himself, as he made resistance, they slew, though at first they could not, for his equipment was of this kind,—he wore a cuirass of gold scales underneath, and over the cuirass he had put on a crimson tunic. So as they struck upon the cuirass they could effect nothing, until some one, perceiving what the matter was, thrust into his eye.’\n\nAnd this is not even getting the development of heavy cavalry by the Assyrians!\n\n4.13: The narrator says the Greeks made up the majority of Cyrus’ forces. This is another piece of information contradicted by Xenophon’s account. At the Battle of Cunaxa it was said:\n\n‘In the final arming for battle at this juncture, the numbers were as follows: Of Hellenes there were ten thousand four hundred heavy infantry with two thousand five hundred targeteers, while the barbarians with Cyrus reached a total of one hundred thousand. ‘\n\nWhile the total number of non-Greek soldiers should be suspect, Xenophon makes it quite clear they were not equal in amount to the other warriors.  \n\n4.21: The narrator states that, at the Battle of Cunaxa, the Greeks smashed through the opposing lines. Once again, the main source for the battle contradicts this. Xenophon says:  \n\n‘But with the forward movement a certain portion of the line curved onwards in advance, with wave-like sinuosity, and the portion left behind quickened to a run; and simultaneously a thrilling cry burst from all lips, like that in honour of the war-god—eleleu! eleleu! and the running became general. Some say they clashed their shields and spears, thereby causing terror to the horses; and before they had got within arrowshot the barbarians swerved and took to flight.’  \n\nThe Achaemenid troops withdraw before the Greeks could get into melee.

        "text": "https://twitter.com/BayemyBiyick/status/1521493044272549888?s=20\n\nThis is the first time I've heard of this idea. Bayemy Biyick's book was shared with me under a video about Japanese history, and I had to take a look. Looking into how this theory is described, it's complete nonsense.\n\n&gt;For several centuries, the Japansese welcomed millions of African refugees who were victims of genocide.\n\nThis is simply improbable. Later they mention that the supposed Black rulers of Japan were displaced by the 7th century. Considering that the estimated population of Japan in the year 700 was 5M (according to Jean-Noël Biraben in *Demography: Analysis and Synthesis: A Treatise in Population*, Vol. 3, part 1, chapter 66, page 13), we'd expect genetic markers to exist in today's Japanese people had \"millions of African refugees\" been welcomed into the country. [A paper by Osada and Kawai](https://doi.org/10.1537/ase.201215) investigating the genetic history of Japanese people corroborates the 'dual-structure' model of migration to Japan. Osada and Kawai state: \"the dual-structure model, the present-day Japanese population consists of two different genetic layers, which correspond to indigenous Jomon hunter-gatherers and rice-farming Yayoi migrants.\" The Yayoi migrants correspond to the time period in which these African refugees would have moved to Japan--but genetically, the Yayoi people are linked to Korean and Southeast Asian populations (Osada et. al.), and archeologically, the southwest Korean peninsula.\n\n&gt;As a distinctive and partly-African state, Kudara was organized around science and self-improvement.\n\nThe name \"Kudara\" is strange. It comes from the romanticization of Japanese name for the kingdom of Baekjae, 百濟. It's odd to choose this pronunciation, because in Hanja, \"Baekjae\" is written the same--百濟--and is pronounced... \"Baekjae\". Kudara==Baekjae, and I'm not sure why this choice was made. That would be like calling China Jungguk instead of Zhōngguó. I can't assess their claim of a society organized around science and self-improvement.\n\n&gt;In 313 AD, by driving out the Han (Chinese) colonists from the [Liaodong] peninsula, the people of Koguryo (North Koreans) became the first military power in Asia.\n\nStarts strong, but only gets worse. Yes, Goguryeo conqured the Liaodong peninsula in 313 AD. No, Han is not synonymous with Chinese (esp. at this period of time), and neither is Goguryeo with \"North Korean\". As for the assertion that they became the first military power in Asia, that's just wrong. I don't see how this connects to \"Kudara\", anyways.\n\n&gt;From the 3rd century AD, Kudara peacefully civilized all of Asia through culture, science, and trade.\n\nThat's a broad claim to make for a country that also supposedly was destroyed and whitewashed from history.\n\n&gt;In 371 AD Kudara conquered the giant Koguryo kingdom, becoming the first military power in Asia.\n\n? I thought the first military power in Asia was Koguryo? Perhaps they mean \"first\" as in \"preeminent\". In any case, it's just wrong. Goguryeo did suffer a military defeat and lost territory to Baekjae/\"Kudara\" in 371 [(source)](https://books.google.com/books?id=g2mdVwXpMzwC&amp;pg=PA37), but the dynasty would last for several hundred more years--they weren't \"conquered\".\n\n&gt;Koguryo (North Koreans) rejected the traditions of the Han (Chinese) and adopted the African scientific civilization of Kudara.\n\n&gt;As early as 371 AD, Kudara built 9 engineering universities in Pyongyang, capital of Koguryo.\n\nThe earliest recorded higher learning institution in Korea was the 태학 (Taehak), but little is known about it. What is known comes from the 12th Century *Samguk Sagi*, where [it is written](https://ko.wikisource.org/wiki/%EC%82%BC%EA%B5%AD%EC%82%AC%EA%B8%B0/%EA%B6%8C18/%EC%86%8C%EC%88%98%EB%A6%BC%EC%99%95): 二年 夏六月 秦王苻堅遣使及浮屠順道 送佛像經文 王遣使廻謝 以貢方物 立大學敎育子弟. This just merely references the possible existence of a university in that time, and in no way suggests that \"as early as 371 AD, Kudara built 9 engineering universities in Pyongyang\".\n\n&gt;China was founded in 581 AD by the Han tribes after the genocide of Black peoples living between Mongolia and the eastern Yellow Sea.\n\nThe only thing right here was that a Han-led Chinese dynasty that would unify China (the Sui dynasty) was founded in 581 AD. Picking 581 AD for the foundation of China is a strange date, considering that the Sui dynasty was short lived and didn't represent the same cultural and political upheaval that other dynastic transitions came with. The genocide aspect here is too broad of a claim to make in one breath; I don't know how to evaluate this beyond \"there is no evidence for the massive genocide of Black peoples in China prior to 581 AD\".\n\n&gt;Silk, a high-tech industry, was developed, mastered and monopolized by African in Asia until the mass genocides.\n\nThis is unlikely. The proposed Black migration to East Asia occurred for several centuries prior to the genocides and overthrow of Black rulers and people in the 6th and 7th centuries. Silk production has been documented [as early as 8,500 years ago](https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0168042), well outside of this timeline.\n\n&gt;Kudara people are the inventors and owners of the writing system currently used in South and North Korea.\n\nHangul? Possibly the language system with the most documentation as to its creation? Given that we have primary sources written by the person credited with creating the language, the [Hunminjeongeum](https://web.archive.org/web/20051014020418/http://www.hangul.or.kr/M2-4-1.htm) and its associated commentary, [the Hunminjongum Haerye](https://web.archive.org/web/20101231071307/http://ling.kgw.tu-berlin.de/Hunminjongum/hun/p01.htm), it's hard to believe that anyone but King Sejong could have invented it. On the contrary, there is no evidence that Black Koreans associated with Baekjae invented the language system implemented by a Joseon king nearly a millennium later.\n\n&gt;King Sejong is, by far, the most honest regent in Korean history.\n\n&gt;In the 14th century AD, China gave Korea all the scientific and cultural heritage stolen from the Kudara people 800 years earlier.\n\n? Huh? I don't know what this is referring to. As a side note, if they had all this stolen advanced scientific and cultural heritage, why did the Chinese not apply this information themselves?\n\n&gt;King Sejong of Korea abandoned neo-Confucianism, converted to African spirituality and had a temple built in his palace.\n\nI have no clue what this is referring to. I'm guessing parallels are being drawn between Korean shamanism and African spirituality, but those are very distinct belief systems. As far as I'm aware, there's no temple he built dedicated to African spirituality.\n\n&gt;It took nearly 300 years to erase the Shilla culture and impose on the Koreans, by force and law, African culture and traditions.\n\nWho is doing the erasing? \"Kudara\", a seperate polity that doesn't exist at this point? Goryeo, a Buddhist nation that is known for their production of valuable historical records (eg. the Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa) that are absent of mentions of Black Koreans?\n\n&gt;Until the 7th century AD, the empresses of Japan were African and descended from the founding clans.\n\n[Here's a contemporary portrait of Empress Suiko, who reigned from 593 – 628 as Empress regnant.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Empress_Suiko_painting.png)\n\n&gt;The 1953 armistice terms of the Korean War took into account the existence of Kudara, the historic Middle Kingdom.\n\nAs far as I can tell, it didn't. The portions of the Chinese copy of the armistice agreement that have been transcribed show no matches for the text, and the English copy makes no mention of \"Kudara\". It wouldn't make sense for the term \"Kudara\" to be used anyways, since that's a Japanese term, and the Japanese weren't the ones negotiating the armistice.\n\n&gt;The North and South Koreans are as brothers as the Finns and the Congolese.\n\nGenetic data (such as that summarized in the plot in Osada et. al.) show close genetic proximity of all Koreans. Korean families in particular have been great at keeping ancestral records, which allow different the origin and movement of different family names to be tracked. Additionally, Korean culture has emphasized marrying outside the clan. Both of these facts result in a traceable ancestry that aligns with intermingling between South and North Koreans prior to the modern era. (No sources for this one but based on my own family experience. My family originally came from China, settled in North Korea, and my close ancestors moved to the southern part of South Korea. I can directly trace North Koreans and South Koreans marrying into my family.)\n\n&gt;Rooted in Asia for at least 3,000 years, racism and ideological and visceral hatred of Black people inspired ideologists and mass criminals in Europe.\n\n???? I have no response to this. That's a broad assertion.\n\n&gt;Who thought, organized, carried out the genocide of more than 20 million Black people in Kudara, and more than 1 billion Blacks in Asia?\n\nThe sudden genocide of 1.020 billion people would have most certainly left behind archeological, cultural, genetic, and linguistic evidence. Where is it?\n\n&gt;Erased form histoory by China, the history of the victims of the genocides in Asia was encrypted and inscribed in nature and on a continental scale.\n\nSounds like Great Pyramids badhistory.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/112y9ha/debunking_grover_furrs_katyn_screed/",
        "text": "I have posted an [analysis](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2023/02/debunking-grover-furrs-katyn-screed.html) of Grover Furr's 2018 book *The Mystery of the Katyn Massacre: The Evidence, the Solution*. I've already dealt with Furr several times, demonstrating his ignorance and lack of honesty and I have already dealt with some key arguments that he uses in his book (which mostly regurgitates other deniers) in various articles. But since it is still used by the deniers of history to whitewash criminals, I thought I will write a detailed refutation of specifically this book, gathering everything in one place as a handy resource.\n\nIn my analysis I first introduce the Katyn history and evidence in a compact form, as a memory refresher. Then I deal with Furr's concept of \"unimpeachable evidence\": Furr at first insists that he will only use the evidence produced against the interest of the side producing it, i. e. only the evidence that (he thinks) could not have been faked. I show both that the principle is not sound when it comes to history-writing and that he abandons it in this very book.\n\nI deal in detail with his numerous assertions that not only the POWs from the Kozelsk POW camp were found in the Katyn forest, but also those from Starobelsk and Ostashkov. That's one of his key points, allegedly undermining the mainstream historiography, but each single example either turns out to be a dud or can be explained equally or more plausibly another way. For example, he thinks that an Ostashkov inventory tag found on a POW's body shows that he was from Ostashkov. I show that he was from Kozielsk (as follows from the letter found on him) and point to numerous Ostashkov POWs transferred to Kozielsk in the early phase. Obviously, this argument doesn't hold water in light of this evidence.\n\nFurr's attempted defense of the Soviet commission's report is shown to be based on ignorance and implausible assumptions (e. g. he claims that he could tell from a document containing a person's surname (which was partially unreadable - \"Pr??ulski\"), name and patronymic that this person was from Ostashkov; but his candidate's surname is \"Kozietulski\", obviously not compatible with the partially deciphered name). He attempts to prove the existence of the special \"ON\" camps for POWs by abandoning his \"unimpeachable evidence\" principle and simply accepting what the Soviet commission claimed to have found. He never deals with the key fact that the actual archive of the Main Administration for Affairs of Prisoners of War and Internees fully debunks the existence of such camps. Neither does he deal with the fact that the Polish POWs from the three camps transferred to the local NKVD offices in April-May 1940 simply disappear from the official internal POW stats.\n\nFurr also does not deal with the fact that Friedrich Ahrens, accused by the Soviets of directly leading the massacre in August and Sepember of 1941, actually only arrived in mid-November.\n\nI briefly deal with Furr's arguments regarding Stalin's shooting order and other documents from the so-called sealed envelope nr. 1, linking to my previous detailed refutations of the denier arguments. The arguments in this chapter against a specific document (an excerpt from the Politburo decision), which Furr thinks is particularly weak, are pathetic - he simply lists whatever he sees as strange in this document (like the fact that Beria's name and the original date were deleted and Shelepin's name and the new date in 1959 are added, or the presence of the CPSU stamp on an excerpt made in 1940, when the party had another name) without making an actual *argument* for forgery. All the allegedly strange elements are actually explained by a particular bureaucratic procedure necessary for sending out such excerpts to specific individuals - their names and the current date had to be on the excerpts (hence the deletions), along with the names of a Central Committee secretary (hence Stalin's name added) and a stamp (since this happened in 1959, a CPSU stamp was added).\n\nProbably the most important evidence for Furr is the finding of police number tags in Volodymyr-Volyns'kiy. Two of these belonged to the policemen POWs who resided in Ostashkov and then were transferred to Kalinin to be shot. Furr argues that the fact that their bodies were found in VV rather than Kalinin disproves the whole story, but never deals with the fact that their bodies actually were never found in VV, the tags were found outside of the grave space and for one of the two POWs it is documented that he had been in VV in 1939 (which was probably the case with the second one). So the most plausible explanation is that their tags were confiscated by the Soviets and remained in the prison, which was overrun by the Germans in 1941, who then disposed on the things they had no need of (there were whole layers of trash near the graves). He goes on and on and on about this supposedly key evidence without understanding that it can be debunked in a single paragraph.\n\nI then deal with the German Katyn report, pointing out that today, in 2023, it can hardly be considered key evidence, given the abundance of the other, much more important documentary complexes. I also point out that the report certainly contains some propaganda lies as well as contradictions, which limit its value, but none of them come close to showing that the Germans committed a grandiose hoax (especially as the Polish Red Cross workers were directly engaged in the exhumations, had their parallel lists of names etc.).\n\nAs evidence of a German hoax Furr cites Polish placenames translated into German (like Lviv was often translated into Lemberg). According to Furr, this either points to forgery, or destroys the bona fides of the German list of names (because sometimes such translations appear in direct citations from the found documents). I point out the parallel Polish list, in which the Polish placenames are used, as well as the fact, that admittedly less than scholarly translation practices don't indicate that the whole was a hoax.\n\nFurr claims that the Germans captured a Soviet list of POW names from Kozelsk, which I show to be  a list of Polish internees (not POWs) that arrived in the camp after the POWs had been transferred to the Katyn forest, and thus the list had nothing to do with Katyn. \n\nFurr claims that the so-called Ukrainian list had nothing to do with Katyn and contained names of persons arrested in late 1940 and even in 1941. I show in many different ways that the latter claim is untrue and those were simply clerical errors, and point out that the persons on the Ukrainian list had the same sequential numbering system that was used for the Kozelsk, Ostashkov and Starobelsk POWs buried in the Katyn forest, in Mednoye and in Pyatikhatki, and therefore Furr's claim is basically a lie.\n\nThat's just the basic outline - dozens of other topics are dealt with in the debunking.\n\nConclusion: \"Furr is not an honest researcher. What he is writing is not history but \"propaganda with footnotes\". He has completely failed to undermine the mainstream views about the Katyn massacre.\n\nAnd as is usual in such cases, I will emphasize that he could neither *credibly* explain where most of the Polish POWs from three POW camps, transported to three UNKVDs in April-May 1940, resided from May 1940 to July 1941, nor *credibly* identify any German unit that would have allegedly committed the massacre in the Katyn forest. Without this any \"revisionist\" project automatically fails. Ta ta!\"",

For example, Military History not Visualized has [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ6Jx9dwpZo) with David Willey, the curator of the Tank Museum at Bovington, where they touch on this and make some very good points. Soviet philosophy was to use their industrial might to build massive numbers of tanks, which, while not the most sophisticated or technologically advanced, would be available huge quantities. That, together with their large population were fundamental for deep operations, or like how Willey put it: \"echelon formations, etc. You know, when one lot's done the other lot's ready.\" An argument from Chris Donnelly is then brought up: the basic assumption from the Soviets was that during a war every side will take massive losses, and while they respected the British and US Corps, they also knew that there was nothing to replace them if they took too much damage. The matter is not as black and white as Lazerpig makes it out to be.\n\nBut all of this is digressing from the main topic. Arguing whether Soviet war philosophy was good or not is beyond the scope of a T-34 design and build quality analysis. I'll try to focus on what is particularly relevant for the T-34, not philosophy as a whole.\n\n&gt; 46:30 \"[The quantity over quality argument you've been furiously typing into the comments this whole time] also known as the endless wave argument, the disposable tank argument, your dad's argument, or more likely the sentence you've had in the forefront of your mind since this video began. That the Russians built the T-34 in the way it did because it had to. The enemy was at the gates and the endless supply of T-34 as a tank still superior to its German counterparts was necessary to beat back the furious might of the Third Reich, because, hey, the Russians won, my dude.\"\n\nSaying the words in a mocking tone, imitating a neckbeard/douchebag stereotype, doesn't prove the argument is bad. The USSR did indeed build the T-34 in the way it did because it had to, as I have already explained. Shortages and the strategic situation in general affected Soviet production in the first half of the war just as they did German production in the second half. In addition, the USSR started the war with relatively few T-34s, and lost most of them in 1941 for a myriad of reasons beyond their own technical shortcomings. Between the problems caused by Stalin's purges leading to bad tactics, the general lack of experience in the army as a whole, the surprise of the German attack, lack of training, etc. it was inevitable the USSR would take heavy losses regardless of how good their tanks were.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 47:08 \"Let me put it like this: would you rather have 100 cheap tanks or 50 expensive ones? Because 100 tanks is not just 100 tanks. That's twice the crew, twice the training, twice the fuel, twice the supply trucks following it around, twice the spare parts, meaning those 100 cheap tanks can end up costing you a lot more than you would have thought.\n\nThis is a gross oversimplification. Of those 100 tanks, 50 could be placed in reserves to be deployed after the first 50 are lost, so 'twice the everything' is not necessarily true.\n\nBesides, this whole point is made under the assumption that the the Soviets could have used the resources (time, man-hours, steel, etc.) needed to build and operate 100 \"cheap\" T-34s to instead build and operate 50 \"expensive\" T-34s that would be more effective than the 100 \"cheap\" ones. And that they should have risked it to test out this hypothesis. How would one even measure the improvement in the first place? Does taking the time to perform quality welds on one tank instead of quick welds on two tanks make that one tank better than two with inferior welding? Does using the nickel you have to build one tank with armour that produces less spall better than building two tanks that suffer from more spalling? Does not saving rubber and building one tank with rubber wheels instead of two or three with steel wheels make that rubber wheeled tank better than the latter two or three?\n\nThis is a good example of the general *could've, should've, would've* attitude that permeates the script. The notion that the Soviets were dumb, and wrong to produce the T-34 the way they did has no basis. The video doesn't present any hard data to support that any other way of producing it was feasible, or would have led to better results, nor does it propose an actual, specific alternative. What few improvements are indirectly suggested are naive and ignore the strategic circumstances of the Soviet Union.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 47:45 \"Russian tank aces are quite rare.\"\n\nCompared to what? German tank aces—the brainchild of Goebbels' propaganda ministry (Perrett 2012, Ch. 14)? And what sources were used in the comparison? Neither the Americans nor the British even recognized the concept (Zaloga 2008, p. 46; Perrett 2012, Introduction). The Soviets considered destroying tanks less important than infantry support, and not particularly heroic (Forty 1997, p. 60). Soviet propaganda, unlike German propaganda, didn't focus on kill claims. What lists of \"Russian tank aces\" exist are not official statistics, but have been compiled by enthusiasts (and contained plenty of names). Using tank ace numbers to judge the performance or survivability of a tank is really misguided.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 48:12 \"In battles where quantity has met quality, and that includes World War 2, quality has won every single time.\"\n\nThis is a gross overgeneralisation. \"Every single time.\" Sweeping statements like this are *almost* always wrong.\n\nThe implication here, whether Lazerpig intends it or not, is that quality alone invariably wins battles. This is not true. The outcome of any battle does not depend solely on the quality of the opposed forces, nor does it depend solely on their quantity. What it depends on (among others) is the disparity between both of these attributes. If one army has only slightly better quality equipment/training than the other, but the other has twice the numbers, quality won't make much of a difference. Furthermore, focusing excessively on individual performance and not having sufficient reserves can lead to losses crippling your ability to fight. A balance needs to be struck in order to be consistently successful.\n\nBut even if we take all of the above into account, this train of thought is not very useful in practice. It's extremely difficult, if not impossible, to quantify these differences in a sufficiently precise way to make good decisions.\n\nBesides, there are other factors that affect the outcome of a battle—terrain, morale, whether it's defensive or offensive, preparedness, coordination, tactics, leadership in general. One of the most famous examples of supposed quality versus quantity is Thermopylae, where the Greeks lost. Then we have the Battle of Kursk, which the Soviets won.\n\nTo conclude, the absolute assertion above is asinine.\n\nSources:\n\n* Bryan Perrett – Iron Fist: Classic Armoured Warfare (1995, 2012)\n* Steven J. Zaloga – Panther vs Sherman: Battle of the Bulge 1944 (2008)\n* George Forty – Tank Aces: From Blitzkrieg to the Gulf War (1997)\n\n# Germany could have won IF\n\nLazerpig makes the point that the war wasn't won by any one Allied nation alone. That's 100% correct, it was a team effort, and he's right to criticise anyone who claims the Soviet Union won the war singlehandedly, but as with the rest of the video, he pushes the pendulum too far in the opposite direction.\n\n&gt; 48:43 \"The idea that any of the major Allied players could have won the war by themselves is at very best a fantasy.\"\n\n&gt; 48:50 \"Russian eagle [sic?] stats are taken on the basis that they killed more Germans than every other front combined and therefore did most of the work but this only takes statistics from the war that actually happened.\"\n\n&gt; 49:00 \"If the war in the west never happened, if Britain, America never got involved, if we take away the high intensity bombing of German factories, the resistance movements that were funded and supplied to by the allies, the secret bidding war that denied supplies of valuable tungsten and aluminium and titanium to the Germans, forcing them to make lower grade designs without it, the huge amounts of length equipment and supplies offered to the Russians through the war, the supply raiding, the oil denying, the deterioration of the Luftwaffe, the massive distraction America provided for the Japanese...\"\n\n&gt; 49:30 \"...could Russia have actually won the war by themselves? No.\"\n\n&gt; 50:04 \"[...] With all the troops freed up from the Western Front, and the various policing duties around Europe, as well as assistance from Japan, and all the materials it needed to produce better designs it was very likely Russia would have just run out of tanks. In spite of their huge production output, they could not offset their losses had the Germans just been able to hit them with a little more intensity.\"\n\nThe Soviets fighting Germany by themselves is counterfactual. Professional historians don't bother seriously pondering such scenarios because the further away you move from what really happened, the harder it is to determine how things would change, making it utterly impossible to know what would occur with any level of accuracy. To top it off, Lazerpig falls in the same trap most \"Germany could have won IF\" scenario writers fall into: focusing entirely on advantages while ignoring disadvantages, and assuming the enemy won't adapt. He envisions an alternative history where the USSR never gets Lend-Lease, but Germany still gets to plunder Europe in order to save its economy from imploding.^n1\n\nActually, such events are not only counterfactual, but entirely beyond the realm of possibility. The geopolitical situation leading to Operation Barbarossa was as such that a conflict between only Germany and the USSR could not have taken place, at least not without massive divergences from our timeline that would further made any attempts to determine what'd transpire impossible. Lazerpig rightly denounces the improper use of \"statistics from the war that actually happened\", but then forms his argument around undefined statistics from a war that never did and never could have happened. Basically, the scenario he proposes is, at the very best, a fantasy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 49:35 \"Russian armored losses stood at nearly 100,000 vehicles,^1 of which 45,000 were T-34s,^2 leaving them with just 12,000 surviving tanks^3 by 1945. German tank losses in the east stood at 40,000^4 and this includes tanks that were lost and handed over after the war ended in order.\"\n\n^1 Correct. 96,500 tanks and SP guns to be more exact.\n\n^2 Of which 44,900 were *medium tanks*, including ~3,700 Lend-Lease M3 and M4 tanks.\n\n^3 11,000 surviving T-34s, 25,200 surviving tanks.\n\n^4 Krivosheev estimates 42,700 tanks, TDs, SPGs and assault guns. In terms of tanks only, Zaloga said 25,584.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 49:52 \"In order to destroy every tank Russia ever had or produced the Germans would have been required to maintain an average kill death ratio of two to four. They achieved a three to five.\"\n\nI can't believe K/D ratios are brought up. First tank aces, and now this.\n\nK/D ratios are a very misleading statistic that's not a good indicator of anything, and are not very useful to military history. They're something that's generally used by the less reputable members of the community to prop up the idea of German superiority over the Allies, and have been mocked for years now, to the point where they've turned into a meme. And even if they weren't, this whole train of thought is pointless anyway. As Lazerpig himself said elsewhere (in his Tiger video, at 18:59), tanks aren't the only thing on the battlefield. There are a myriad of factors that play into loss rates for the T-34 beyond it's own technical specifications. Oh, and the numbers are wrong.^n2\n\n****************************\n\nNotes:\n\n^n1 There's [a great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1e0hmf/to_what_extent_was_nazi_germanys_economic/) over on /r/AskHistorians that covers this topic, if anyone's interested.  \n^n2 [Actual numbers](https://imgur.com/B8nB6Hb) for tanks.

Krivosheev – Soviet Casualties and Combat Losses in the Twentieth Century (1993)\n* Steven J. Zaloga, Leland S. Ness – Red Army Handbook, 1939-1945 (1998)\n\n# Vicious cycle\n\n&gt; 50:22 \"The 34 was trapped in a cycle of production.\"\n\n&gt; 50:36 \"Russia needed more tanks to make up for their losses and this in turn forced them to crank out tanks of a poor quality, many of which were lost in huge numbers due to that poor quality, which in turn required more of them to be built.\"\n\nThis is the zenith of Lazerpig's 'en mass from day one' thesis, and it's almost entirely wrong. \n\nAs I've said before, the staggering losses in the first stages of the war, as well as losses in the subsequent years, were caused by a multitude of factors, most of which Lazerpig ignores in his quest to paint the T-34 as a terrible tank. And the USSR didn't start with that many T-34s to begin with. And the strategic situation—shortages, lost territories, moving factories—affected build quality tremendously. In fact, it's fair to say it did so a lot more than the quantitative requirements, seeing how quality improved once the situation improved as well, and how Soviet tank tactics are described in the history books.\n\nLosses did indeed lead to higher demand, which affected quality, so I understand why people might perceive a vicious cycle, but even if we accept it as fact, it's nonsensical to claim it all started because the T-34 was built badly from the beginning.\n\nThere's also the matter of the Soviets completely [overestimating German production](https://i.imgur.com/5q3bOxR.jpg), just like the British did during the Battle of Britain.\n\nAll of these things together led to the T-34 being produced the way it was.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 50:48 \"A never-ending cycle which many proclaim was entirely unnecessary, had Russia just made a better tank, or, at the very least, made them to a higher quality.\"\n\nA never-ending cycle which ended as soon as the situation improved, and the Soviets learned to coordinate their armoured forces properly.\n\nCitation needed. Many? Who? His own sources disagree: \"It was necessary to choose between producing better tanks, but in smaller quantities and with some delay, or producing as many tanks as possible that, despite all their shortcomings, could be built immediately, when they were so sorely needed. The choice was clear: The front could not wait and survive on promises and hopes for a better future\" (Kavalerchik 2015, p. 207).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 50:56 \"Even by 1944 it become [sic] common practice to replace the engines of any T-34 that had been running for more than 30 hours before a major assault.\"\n\nI covered this already. It's mentioned in *T-34 Mythical Weapon* and nowhere else; or at least I haven't found it in any of my other sources.\n\nSources:\n\n* Boris Kavalerchik – Once Again About the T-34, The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1 (2015)\n* Robert Michulec – T-34 Mythical Weapon (2002)\n\n# Cost\n\n&gt; 53:08 \"So here is the truth: the T-34 was not designed to be cheap and mass-produced, it was actually a fairly expensive design.\"\n\nHistorians disagree. \"We have already mentioned the simplicity of the T-34's design as something that could not be more suitable to the limited capabilities of Soviet industry at that time. This feature also substantially facilitated both its production and repair under field conditions\" (Kavalerchik 2015, p. 212). \"The T-34's utilitarian and robust design made it easy to mass produce...\" (Fleischer 2018, Tucker-Jones' Foreword). \"The predominant characteristic of the T-34 was the ideal combination of mobility, firepower and armour in a vehicle suitable for mass production\" (ibid. Introduction). \"It was a simple tank with a rough but serviceable finish that was ideal for mass production\" (Tucker-Jones 2015, Ch. 1). \"The T-34/76 was a simple, rugged and highly mobile tank with greater firepower than most of its contemporaries. It was well suited to mass production but suffered some significant design flaws in the early versions\" (Dunstan 2009, p. 9). Even the Aberdeen 'report' notes the \"simplicity of design\" as a \"distinguishing feature\".  At most one could argue that the first models weren't optimised for mass production, since \"early T-34s enjoyed a high level of craftsmanship in their manufacture\" (Zaloga 1994, p. 9). However, designs change as new requirements arise. \"The high level of craftsmanship disappeared but production time of the T-34 was cut in half and the cost was driven down...\" (ibid. p. 19).\n\nThe problem with Lazerpig's reasoning, and why he reaches this incorrect conclusion, is that he has a very narrow definition of 'design'.^n1 As I noted above, a vehicle's design is not some immutable plan to be followed in perpetuity, and changes implemented during the production run aren't conceptually separate from it. Of the 'shortcuts' he listed previously, some are indisputably design choices, such as the steel-rimmed wheels, or the lack of a turret basket, with the latter being part of the T-34 from the very beginning. Those that could be considered desperate improvisations, not part of intended design, were merely temporary practices. And they only further simplified the production of a tank that was already simple to produce. Remember that costs continued to decrease even as quality improved.\n\n^n1 This is first hinted at 35:05, leading to the 'shortcuts' section, where he says: \"There are a number of issues which many haters of the T-34 will attribute to design, but I feel it more fair to place under the category of manufacturing defects.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 53:15 \"American studies of the T-34 suggest that if built to American standards the T-34-76 would cost around the same amount of money, resources, and manpower as the Sherman, even when accounting for the Russian economy of the period.\"\n\nThere is only one American study that mentions costs: the CIA analysis of the captured Korean T-34, which is listed as one of the video's sources. I've seen no mention in the Aberdeen 'report', and there aren't any other studies of T-34s by the US. However, the tank analysed by the CIA was a T-34-85, not a T-34-76, and it was built in 1945, so it was likely on the expensive side when compared to earlier designs.\n\nAnyway, even ignoring the exact model, the CIA report still doesn't say what Lazerpig suggests. It merely states that: \"While no accurate estimate of the probable cost of this vehicle can be made from the information available, it is believed that the cost at the time of manufacture, converted to U.S.A. currency, would exceed $50,000\" (p. 5). So not only does it emphasize from the start that the number presented is just a rough estimate, it also says the cost \"would exceed\" it, further reducing its usefulness. But let's look at the figure anyway. $50,000 in 1951 is ~$34,600 adjusted for inflation in 1945 money. A Sherman, meanwhile, according to the same site Lazerpig lists as a source,^1 which itself cites the 9 August 1945 Army Service Forces Catalog,^2 costs between $44,556 and $64,455. We'll consider the M4A3E2 and M4A6 as outliers and limit the range to $44,556–$54,836. The cheapest Sherman is still around $10,000 more expensive than the T-34 estimate. But wait, the CIA says it \"would exceed\" that amount. Sure, but by how much? 30%? That's the difference between 35 and 45 grand. And keep in mind this was an example of a higher end T-34, so maybe we should compare it to the $54,000 Shermans. So was the CIA 54% off? And Lazerpig specifically mentions the T-34-76, which would likely be cheaper—especially the mid war designs.\n\nTo recap, it was just one study, not multiple, and it was a T-34-85, not a T-34-76, and the report just mentions money, not resources or manpower, and there's no mention of \"American standards\", and Lazerpig forgot to factor in inflation. So, if anything, comparing the CIA figure with those in the Army Service Forces Catalog makes it seem the T-34 was cheaper than the Sherman. Unless, of course, you want to assume the real cost exceeded the CIA estimate by 30-54%, which has been proposed to me in a past argument, but then why even reference the report? That's just wishful thinking fuelled guesswork.\n\nAnyway, even if Lazerpig hadn't messed up the details, the issue remains that the CIA report gives a low confidence estimate, so it shouldn't be relied on too much. The logical next step would be to look at difference sources, but unfortunately that won't give a definitive answer either.\n\nZaloga actually covered the subject of cost comparison in *Armored Champion*. Here are some excerpts from Chapter 1:\n\n* \"It is very difficult to compare prices between two countries since the accounting methods were so different and the exchange rates likely to be artificial. For example, many German weapons prices reflected the payment to the manufacturer for the 'tin box' even though some major components such as the gun and power-train were provided to the assembly plant as government-furnished equipment (GFE). So for example in the case of the Panther tank, the basic price was listed as 117,100 RM (Reichsmark), but the gun cost an additional 12,000 RM.\"\n* \"The price of tanks also varied from factory to factory due to the availability of machine tools and other equipment. For example, for one of the Panther production batches, the additional state investment in machine tools and facilities at some plants such as Daimler-Benz in Berlin and MNH in Hannover was about 25,000 RM per tank, about 82,000 RM per tank at the new Nibelungen Werk in St. Valentin, and some 190,000 RM at Demag in Falkensee. In addition, there was wide variation in prices at the various plants due to different rates of taxation depending on whether the plant was private or state-owned.\"\n* \"Other problems with assessing German prices were the politicization of the process resulting from the 1943 'Adolf Hitler Panzer Program' and the temptation of Albert Speer's armaments ministry to claim enormous cost efficiencies on new tank types such as the Panther and to hide or disguise capital investments needed for production.\"\n* \"It’s worth noting that the price for a Tiger I tank for the German army was about 300,000 RM, but the example sold to Japan was priced at 645,000 RM, an amount more likely to reflect the actual cost including industrial infrastructure investment.\"\n* He also covers, as have other historians, the differences in costs between factories and over time for the T-34. \"The price of a given tank, for example the T-34, varied depending on the contract batch, the plant, and the specific production series. [...] the amount of work needed to manufacture a T-34 tank declined through the war due to efficiencies and automation, but varied considerably from plant to plant.\"\n\n*******************************\n\nReferences:\n\n^1 [Sherman's 1945 prices](http://web.inter.nl.net/users/spoelstra/g104/cost.htm)  \n^2 Army Service Forces Catalog ORD 5-3-1, 9 August 1945.\n\nSources:\n\n* Boris Kavalerchik – Once Again About the T-34, The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1 (2015)\n* Wolfgang Fleischer – T-34: An Illustrated History of Stalin's Greatest Tank (2018)\n* Anthony Tucker-Jones – T-34: The Red Army's Legendary Medium Tank (2015)\n* Simon Dunstan – Centurion vs T-55: Yom Kippur War 1973 (2009)\n* Steven J.

It was a costly tank manufactured cheaply, with its numerous teething issues never getting the chance to be fully ironed out, with Russia's only choice but to continue producing more at extremes of poor quality in order to offset the tank's staggering losses.\"\n\nThe T-34 was \"a simple tank\"^[1] manufactured as circumstances allowed,^[2][3][4] with many if not most of its teething issues solved by the end of the war,^[5][6][7] with the USSR's only choice but to adapt the design when faced with shortages,^[8][9] and make sacrifices to maintain sufficient production to offset the tank's staggering losses caused not by its technical shortcomings as much as bad tactics, training, etc.^[10][11][12]\n\n\nDespite its flaws, the T-34, at the very least in its 1945 form, was a good tank. It was good enough to help the Soviets win the war, and it was good enough to still be built after it. \"The fact that the T-34 continued to see combat into the 1990s is testimony to its durability. The T-34 was no wonder weapon, but it was good and it just happened to be in the right place at the right time. It proved to be what Stalin and the Red Army needed—a true war winner\" (Tucker-Jones 2015, Epilogue). It \"basically won the war for the Red Army\" (Chieftain's Hatch: BT-7, 9:06), \"as a strategic war-winning vehicle, this thing served the Red Army supremely\" (Chieftain's Hatch: T-34-85, 22:31).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 54:02 \"Had the T-34 belonged to any other nation, it would have been regarded as an abysmal embarrassing failure of a machine.\"\n\nNot even the Americans regarded it as such, and they had the highest standards of the war. The Aberdeen 'report' is somewhat critical, which isn't surprising given when the tank was built, and not even it says that. The CIA report, meanwhile, is quite positive, and shows how UTZ 183 improved between 1942 and 1945. \"In general, the study concluded that the T-34-85 was an excellent tank, but that the North Korean crews were not as well trained as their American opponents\" (Zaloga 2006, p. 75). The British praised it too, noting that \"the design and production of such useful tanks in such great numbers stands out as an engineering achievement of the first magnitude\" (Preliminary Report No. 20, Foreword).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI think Pulham and Kerrs end their book with a nuanced take on the T-34 which nicely summarises everything I've covered thus far, so I'll end with some excerpts from their epilogue:\n\n\"With regards to the raging debate on whether the T-34 was a ‘good’ tank or ‘the best tank of the Second World War’ (whatever these terms may mean), [...] the production history of the T-34 was complex and it made the vehicle heterogeneous. In other words, one T-34 from one factory would differ in quality from another—likewise for tanks made at different times (e.g. 1941 and 1943). While it is true that the T-34's construction quality was sometimes abysmal (especially STZ-made tanks, and tanks made in 1942–1943), this was, for the most part, a result of circumstances of the war—chiefly a shortage of materials—and the need for high production figures led to a simplification of the design and rushed production. [...] However, the point is that the design quality of the T-34 not only improved as the Second World War continued, but was always quite high. Indeed, the popular culture (and ‘pop’ history) conception of Soviet tank designers, engineers, and military scientists all as totally ill-educated, inexperienced, and incompetent proletarians is very much a hangover from the height of the Cold War and should be discarded once and for all. [...] The T-34-85, for example, was of a much higher quality than its mid, early, and pre-war predecessors [...] The use of sound tactics is more important to military success than the quality of one's equipment [...] Every tank was built to fit a specific need at a specific time and was designed to fit a specific manufacturing process, thus the use of the term ‘best’ is problematic. [...] Different states [have] different factories, different resources, different military doctrines and war necessities, different front lines, and different military and production experiences, and any given version of these highly heterogeneous tanks is not representative of the vehicle series as a whole.\n\n\"As Boris Kavalerchik (‘Once Again About the T-34’, p. 187) summarises: ‘Any piece of equipment, including tanks, has its own virtues and shortcomings.’\"\n\n***********************\n\nReferences:\n\n^1 Tucker-Jones 2015, Ch. 1  \n^2 Kavalerchik 2015, pp. 191, 205-206, 208  \n^3 Loza 1998, p. 10  \n^4 Pulham &amp; Kerrs 2021, Ch. 25  \n^5 Kavalerchik 2015, p. 206  \n^6 Kavalerchik 2018, Ch. 9.1  \n^7 Zaloga 2015, Ch. 7-9  \n^8 Kavalerchik 2015, p. 195  \n^9 Zaloga 2015, Ch. 1  \n^10 Zaloga 2015, Ch. 5  \n^11 Forczyk 2007, p. 48  \n^12 Töppel 2019  \n\nSources:\n\n* Anthony Tucker-Jones – T-34: The Red Army's Legendary Medium Tank (2015)\n* Boris Kavalerchik – Once Again About the T-34, The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1 (2015)\n* Dmitri Loza, James F.

In fact, it improved beyond that of German tanks of the time, which had degraded. Therefore it is incorrect to say that no British, French, and especially no German tank could match the break down rate of the T-34. The same goes for losses in combat. A tank fielded in massive numbers will inevitably see comparatively more losses in terms of absolute numbers than one barely produced. The T-34 also saw combat for the vast majority of the war, from 1941 to 1945.\n\nBesides, loss rates alone don't give a faithful assessment of the competency of a vehicle as they ignore the strategic and operational circumstances in which these losses took place. One is the issue of the still developing tactics of Soviet tank units, where training was often hastened and units deployed poorly into battle (Forczyk 2007, p. 48). For example, during the Battle of Kursk: \"The 5th Guards Tank Army, they had 850 tanks. If they had used them all in one single counterattack, the 2nd SS Panzer Corps, I think, would have been in trouble\" (Töppel 2019, 1:21). \"The Germans noticed that at this time. When you read the German after-action reports and war diaries, you see that they [...] say we are lucky that the Russians have masses of tanks but they only use them piecemeal\" (ibid. 1:46). \"The Red Army had not recovered from these terrible losses during the 1937-38 to the purges, and of course also the commanders that were killed in the first war years, and so they had a problem on a command level. You can read this in Russian books, modern history books too, that they really had not learned yet how to lead and coordinate [...] and employ such great tank masses\" (ibid. 2:17). Had the tanks involved in the soviet attack been Shermans or Pz.IVs given the same orders, the results would have likely been the same.\n\nIn essence, Lazerpig puts too much focus on the technical specifications of the T-34 and not enough on the other aspects of Soviet performance. Arguably one of the most important area in which the Soviets were lacking was coordinating their armoured forces. Stalin's purges had crippled the Red Army's leadership at multiple levels. And the Soviets were not the only ones suffering from this. German success in general was thanks to how well they coordinated their panzers. Even in 1940, the French did not coordinate their theoretically superior tanks, instead using them piecemeal. \"The decisive cause for the German success in battle against French tanks was the fact that the French always fought against the regiment only with a small number of tanks. Therefore it was possible to destroy them with the concentrated fire of our relatively few armor-defeating weapons. It could lead to a very difficult situation if the French employed a large number of Somua tanks against us.\" (Jentz 1996, p. 123)\n\nSources:\n\n* Robert Forczyk – Panther vs T-34: Ukraine 1943 (2007)\n* Military History not Visualized – [Soviet Tank Doctrine - Kursk 1943 featuring Dr. Roman Töppel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWp1I_zGeow) (2019)\n* Thomas L. Jentz – Panzertruppen, The Complete Guide to the Creation &amp; Combat Employment of Germany's Tank Force, 1933-1942 (1996)\n\n# UTZ 183\n\n&gt; 38:13 \"Factory 183 produced some of the worst T-34s of the war, and are largely responsible for all the examples we're about to go over.\"\n\nBy Factory 183 he means the Uralmash Tank Plant No. 183 in Nizhny Tagil, also known as UTZ or UTF, and not former Kharkov Locomotive Factory renamed to Factory No. 183 in 1936. He first mentions it at around 7:52.\n\nI'm not sure what he means exactly by \"some of the worst\" and will presume he doesn't mean the actual worst. Because it's STZ that probably produced the actual worst T-34s, but that was to be expected. \"Due to the poor conditions at STZ, especially during the Battle of Stalingrad, the quality of STZ tanks was always less than that of other factories\" (Pulham &amp; Kerrs 2021, Ch. 25). At the same time, UTZ 183 also produced some of the best T-34s. In 1942, it \"was producing T-34s with noticeably better quality than all other tank makers. The fact that in autumn 1941 the Kharkov Locomotive Factory—the cradle of the T-34—had been evacuated to Nizhny Tagil and combined with the local train car factory contributed to this in no small way. The UTF arose on this solid base, inheriting its number (183) from the Kharkovites\" (Kavalerchik 2015, p. 189). The T-34-85 captured in Korea was a 1945 UTZ 183 model and the CIA \"study concluded that [it] was an excellent tank\" (Zaloga 2006, p. 75). UTZ also spearheaded quality control for the T-34. One example is when \"the Nizhni-Tagil design bureau had been pressing the GABTU to allow them to impose greater uniformity on the several plants manufacturing the T-34-85 and to put more emphasis on quality control at the subcontracting plants\" (Zaloga 2015, Ch. 8).\n\nSources:\n\n* Francis Pulham, Will Kerrs – T-34 Shock: The Soviet Legend in Pictures (2021)\n* Boris Kavalerchik – Once Again About the T-34, The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1 (2015)\n* Steven J.

That's an impressive 26,000 tanks, more tanks than most nations had in total during the war. How the fuck did they do that? Well, gigantification is a factor. Factory 183 was fucking huge and could therefore produce way more tanks than smaller factories. However, there's another more obvious factor. In 1941, it took 8,000 man-hours to build one complete T-34. Factory 183, by 1943, had gotten this down to 3,700 hours. How? Well, they made shortcuts.\"\n\nThis section is mostly correct, except for the last sentence. In essence, Lazerpig suggests that UTZ built a lot of tanks because it was big and because it cut production costs. So far so good. However, he goes on to imply that shortcuts were the only reason costs decreased, or at least the only one worth mentioning. This is an oversimplification. They didn't just cut corners. \"The amount of work needed to manufacture a T-34 tank declined through the war due to efficiencies and automation\" (Zaloga 2015, p. 38). \"The wide use of welding, cold forging and casting enabled a substantial increase in labour productivity and reduced the tanks' cost of production\" (Kavalerchik 2018, Ch. 9.1). \"The incredible rate of tank production was in part due to mechanical engineer Yevgeny Oskarovich Paton, who designed a portable fusion welder. Nikita Khrushchev recalled: 'Thanks to the improvements he introduced in our tank production, tanks started coming off our assembly lines like pancakes off a griddle.'\" (Tucker-Jones 2021, Ch. 4). These are important aspects that Lazerpig omits. In addition, the next part of the video is dedicated to listing what he considers to be shortcuts which negatively affected the T-34's performance. So the real point he's trying to make is that UTZ decided to cut corners so they could produce innumerable tanks, all at the cost of vehicle performance. This is an overgeneralisation. Many of the modifications were more due to shortages than a desire to further increase production, and were temporary; one was not even a shortcut, but an original design decision, and not that detrimental to performance; but I'll cover them later, one by one, as they are mentioned.\n\nIt's worth looking at [how costs evolved](https://i.imgur.com/MJUgLgf.png) in other factories throughout the war. Notice how man-hour requirements decreased continuously. Quality decreased in the first half of the war, before going back up, but costs only went down. This suggest there is little correlation between the T-34's quality and how long it took to build. Kavalerchik puts it perfectly: \"Soviet [...] engineers were able to improve [...] reliability and length of service life, and did this while the pace of production output grew relentlessly\" (Kavalerchik 2018, Ch. 9.1).\n\nSources: \n\n* Steven J. Zaloga – Armored Champion: The Top Tanks of World War II (2015)\n* Boris Kavalerchik – The Tanks of Operation Barbarossa: Soviet versus German Armour on the Eastern Front (2018)\n* Anthony Tucker-Jones – Stalin's Armour, 1941-1945 Soviet Tanks at War (2021)\n\n# Lights\n\n&gt; 38:58 \"Firstly, they found things to just remove from the design. Lights. Tanks don't need those. Now crews can't see in the dark.\"\n\nLazerpig fails to mention this change was short-lived. \"Later in production, after the move to UTZ 183, but before the implementation of the hexagonal turret, headlights were removed entirely, then re-introduced\" (Pulham &amp; Kerrs 2021, Ch. 16).\n\nSources:\n\n* Francis Pulham, Will Kerrs – T-34 Shock: The Soviet Legend in Pictures (2021)\n\n# Waterproofing\n\n&gt; 39:16 \"During rain, even light rain, the hatches would leak, causing water to drip over the electronics inside and short them out, and this often meant that the turret motor would seize and have to be manually cranked which was not easy given the lack of room inside.\"\n\nAberdeen mentions the possibility of the \"electrical equipment becoming disabled\" due to leaks, but specifically notes \"heavy rain\" (Kavalerchik 2015, p. 194). Regardless, this was not a universal issue. Normally the T-34 had rubber seals, \"but in the beginning of 1942 the USSR was experiencing a severe rubber shortage. Factories that were producing the raw materials for manufacturing it were located in the western regions of the country, and, because of the German advance, were forced to evacuate and started their production in new locations. As a result, from November 1941 through May 1942 industry operated only with prewar reserves and Lend-Lease natural rubber. Therefore, there was an attempt to economize on rubber in every possible way, and it was supplied only where it was absolutely necessary.\" In addition, \"to reduce production's labor consumption and because of the shortage of machine tools, they stopped finish-machining parts, especially hulls, except in those cases where it was completely impossible to manage without it. This resulted in an increase in the clearance between the parts. As a result of such measures the watertight integrity of the T-34's hull also suffered\" (ibid. p. 195).\n\nBasically, this is a faulty generalisation.\n\nSources:\n\n* Boris Kavalerchik – Once Again About the T-34, The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1 (2015)\n\n# Radios\n\n&gt; 39:35 \"Internal radios. Who needs those? In fact only the command tank would have the radio...\"\n\nThis is another faulty generalisation. The lack of radios was an issue that only affected some batches of the T-34, whereas Lazerpig makes it sound like a universal problem. Even worse, in his sarcasm, he seems to be implying that the Soviets were idiots who thought they were fine simply using signal flags.\n\nThe Soviets didn't just decide their tanks didn't need radios. In fact, \"the Red Army intended to make widespread use of radios, but cost and poor radio technology limited it.\" Soviet use of radios decreased at first due to shortages, then increased again as production improved (Zaloga 2015, Ch. 1). \"Not all T-34 tanks were equipped with radios, though the proportion grew as the war progressed. At the beginning of the war, the company commander's tank was nearly always fitted with a 71-TK-3 transmitter/receiver, and efforts were made to provide a similar set to platoon leaders\" (Zaloga 1994, p. 37). In 1943, the \"production of tank radios was two and a half times greater than in 1942. As a result, all new tanks were supposed to be equipped with radios, making coordinated tank tactics easier to accomplish. In practice, about 75 to 80 per cent had functional radios by the summer of 1943, but even this was a vast improvement\" (Zaloga 1994, p. 33). \"About 80% of T-34s were equipped with the 9R AM radio by late 1943\" (Forczyk 2007, p. 34). \"More radios were issued to the tanks, and by the time the cupola was introduced in August 1943, nearly every tank had a radio\" (Pulham &amp; Kerrs 2021). By 1944, the 9-R radio was installed \"on all T-34-85s, without exception\" (Kavalerchik 2015, p. 205).\n\nSources:\n\n* Steven J.

Yes, some T-34s lacked internal seating, and mostly for the hull gunner who would just find a box or something.\"\n\nCitation needed. He includes [some footage](https://i.imgur.com/6QTBQeo.png), but that looks like something filmed in the modern day. I skimmed my sources and found nothing about seats not being installed. Neither Kavalerchik's harsh but fair articles, nor Michulec's harsh and unfair *Mythical Weapon* mention anything.\n\n# Heat treating!\n\n&gt; 40:10 \"Heat treating! Do we really need to heat treat all the metal? I mean, not all of it is going to be under fire, so the internal components like the gearbox, the driveshaft, etc., etc. were not heat treated and prone to excessive grinding which wore them down faster.\"\n\nAnother faulty generalisation. As with everything, the quality of the heat treatment varied depending on the place and time. The Americans criticised the heat treatment of the gears, particularly the teeth, not the whole gearbox, and that of the suspension springs, though heat treatment was not the only factor that affected their performance. Shortages in various materials were also a factor (Kavalerchik 2015, pp. 199, 202-203). The heat treatment of other internal components is not mentioned. There's no reason to believe this did not improve by the end of the war. At the very least, the 1945 built T-34-85 recovered from Korea had good heat treatment on its internal parts. Funnily enough, the transmission gears were an exception to this, but they weren't as fragile as the ones on the Aberdeen T-34. At the same time, some parts were \"unnecessarily heat treated thus adding to production costs\" (CIA 1951, p. 299). However, \"In general, the accompanying heat treatment seemed equally well suited to requirements, and control seemed quite satisfactory\" (ibid. p. 11).\n\nSources: \n\n* Boris Kavalerchik – Once Again About the T-34, The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1 (2015)\n* CIA-RDP81-01044R000100070001-4: Engineering Analysis of the Russian T-34-85 (1951)\n\n# The turret basket\n\n&gt; 40:25 \"Turret basket! You know that platform the gunner and the loader stand on so they're always lined up with where the gun is pointing? Don't need that. They can just turn around like real men and learn to duck so they don't get smacked in the head by that breach every time the turret moves.\"\n\nThe gunner doesn't stand. He has a seat. As for the loader, that's sadly the price you have to pay to stow ammo in the hull floor—it has to be accessible, and a turret floor gets in the way.\n\nTo clarify, as with many aspects of tank design, this is a matter of compromise. Having a turret floor is great, but it restricts access to the space beneath it. The best example of this is the Sherman, which went from a full turret basket to a half basket with no walls at all and no floor under the loader.\n\nLazerpig previously criticised the T-34 for placing fuel tanks \"in the fighting compartment, with the crew.\" Early, 'Dry Stowage' Shermans stored ammo in a similar way, all over the crew compartment (as did many other tanks). \"Penetration from nearly anywhere in the frontal arc would bring a projectile in contact with ammunition\". This and \"the propensity of American crews to pile in added ammunition\" led to burn rates of 60-80%; 'Wet Stowage' decreased that to 10-15% (Zaloga 1993, pp. 15-16). In case you don't know what 'Wet Stowage' is, there's [a brilliant post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4kdbx6/tanks_what_exactly_is_a_wet_ammo_rack_are_the/) over on /r/AskHistorians that discusses it in good detail. Essentially, ammo was moved to the hull floor, where it was a lot less likely to get hit. There was also a 'quenching solution' (hence the term 'wet'), but it was ultimately found to have little to no effect. The location was the most important aspect.\n\n75 mm 'Wet' Shermans still had a turret floor, storing most of the ammo under it. This ammo was accessible via some hatches, as seen [here](http://the.shadock.free.fr/sherman_minutia/manufacturer/m4a375w/m4a375w_27.jpg). Only 4 rounds were stored above, in a sort of ready rack (1). As you might imagine, accessing the rounds in the hull was not easy. The 76 mm variants got rid of the floor under the loader entirely, as seen [here](http://the.shadock.free.fr/sherman_minutia/manufacturer/m4a376w/m4a376w_49.jpg).\n\nSherman crews weren't happy about it, but as I said, it's the price you have to pay. \"Dean Klefman: “I've crewed two versions of the Sherman, the M4A3E8 'Easy 8' and the 'Grizzly'. The Easy 8 is the Cadillac of the Shermans, a really fine tank; but it has one bad feature, and that's a half-basket. The turret basket on this model is only under the TC and the gunner; the loader stands on the hull floor when he isn't sitting down.”\" (Halberstadt 1997, p. 66) People echo this sentiment to this day, even if they haven't fought in the tank. I've held baffling conversations that made me realise I actually have to defend the design decision of sacrificing the turret floor to store ammo in the hull floor. I won't do that, but at the very least I hope I've proven it's not the bad design choice some make it out to be.\n\nAnd the Sherman was not the only other tank to feature a distinct lack of turret flooring. There's also the Pershing; \"there was no turret basket in the Pershing\" (Zaloga 2017, p. 28). Funnily enough, the prototype had one, but \"the turret basket and ammunition stowage were roundly criticized, leading to a redesign that largely removed most of the basket and increased 90mm ammunition stowage\" (ibid. p. 20). Case in point.\n\nAnother example of a tank without a turret basket is the Panzer III, a vehicle that is often compared to the early T-34 and noted to be ergonomically superior, and rightfully so. However, it has neither a turret floor nor a loader seat (Chieftain's Hatch 2018, 7:26). To clarify, the Panzer III Ausf. A through H did have a seat for the loader, and you'll find this 'Ladeschuetzensitz' mentioned throughout Panzer Tracts (Jentz &amp; Doyle 2006, pp. 36, 60; Jentz &amp; Doyle 2007, pp. 64, 70, 74; Jentz &amp; Doyle 2009, pp. 10-11), but the \"Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.J with a 5 cm Kw.K.39 (L/60) did not have a Ladeschuetzensitz (loader's seat) installed\" (Jentz &amp; Doyle 2009, p. 40). \"There was no turret floor, so the loader had to walk on the hull floor as the turret traversed\" (Rottman 2008, p. 18). \"The loader, who stands on the right­hand side of the gun, has no seat and must therefore walk around with the turret as it traverses\" (Green 2000, p. 46).\n\nThe Centurion didn't have a turret basket floor either (Chieftain's Hatch 2016, 9:07). The M24 Chaffee didn't have a basket at all (Chieftain's Hatch 2013, 0:15).\n\nNicholas Moran summarises it pretty well: \"And, of course, there is no turret platform. Certainly you got places for you gunner and your commander to put their seats, but the loader, if he's got to be reaching for things that are not conveniently located, he's got to watch where his feet go. But he does actually have a place that he can sit and the rounds are small enough that it's not so necessary for him to be on his feet anyway. Because they're easy enough to manhandle inside the tank and of course he's got all this room on his side of the tank.\" (Moran 2018, 13:12)\n\nSources:\n\n* Steven J.

The T-34 has steel road wheels on steel tracks [...]\"\n\nJust as with the radios, rubber was used when it was available. Some late KhPZ 183 T-34s had idler wheels that lack rubber; you know, since \"the Wehrmacht was not only close to Kharkov, but getting ever closer to Moscow\" (Pulham &amp; Kerrs 2021, Ch. 17). The biggest shortage was in Stalingrad, where, after a while, tanks began being built with \"cast road wheels [that] lacked any external rubber but had internal shock absorbers\" (ibid. Ch. 23). \n\n\"In November 1942, the rearmost road wheel was replaced. Originally a cast spider type was put onto the fifth position, but it was replaced with a fourth cast steel-rimmed type road wheel. This was done as supplies of rubber road wheels for UTZ 183 were running short, therefore the minimum amount of rubber was used. It should be noted however that all of the other factories were increasing the amount of rubber road wheels used\" (ibid. Ch. 31). UTZM, meanwhile, had no such issues when it \"began T-34 production in August 1942\", using all rubber-rimmed wheels, \"likely due to UTZM receiving their shipments of wheels from a different subsidiary than UTZ\" (ibid. Ch. 34).\n\nKavalerchik covers this topic too, albeit in less detail than *T-34 Shock*. I've already quoted him on rubber shortages on the topic of waterproofing, but he also mentions rubber wheels: \"As one of the measures of this [rubber] economization, from January 1942 through August 1943 road wheels on T-34 tanks were provided with internal rubber cushioning instead of solid tires\" (Kavalerchik 2015, p. 195).\n\nAnd do you know who else did that? The Germans. When Germany began having its own rubber shortages they did the exact same thing. Hilary L. Doyle says in a Chieftain video: \"Rubber eventually was to be only used for things that couldn't be done effectively with any other medium, so gradually they were replacing any wheels they could—like the return rollers could be a steel roller, they could get away with that. Then they were introducing steel tired road wheels where the rubber was still there but it was inside the wheel where it was protected and lasted longer\" (Chieftain's Hatch 2020, 9:40).\n\nAnyway, point is this was not an universal issue. Lazerpig shows one picture of a rubber-rimmed T-34, but otherwise this entire section sounds like another faulty generalisation. And he doesn't stop there. Next, he dumps a list of various parts which were omitted when times were desperate. Frankly, this entire section, as well as the arguments leading to it, disingenuously paint the T-34 as a worse tank than it actually was by implying it universally suffered from issues it didn't universally suffer from.\n\nSources: \n\n* Francis Pulham, Will Kerrs – T-34 Shock: The Soviet Legend in Pictures (2021)\n* Boris Kavalerchik – Once Again About the T-34, The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1 (2015)\n* Nicholas Moran – Inside the Chieftain's Hatch: Panzer IV Pt 3 (2020)\n\n# More reliability talk\n\n&gt; 41:42 \"The designer who was driving the tank at the time was so exhausted he caught pneumonia during the trip and fucking died.\"\n\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with either the design or the build quality of the tank. The poor man fell into a freezing river.\n\nAccording to Igor Zheltov: \"On the way from Moscow to Kharkov, the tank fell into the river, the designer fell into icy water and thus thoroughly undermined his health. Until that moment, he worked for wear and tear, and the cold finally knocked him down.\" This is also noted in Peter Samsonov's *Designing the T-34* (p. 51): \"Early at the start of the drive, the tank Koshkin was riding in slipped and fell into a river. Upon his return to the factory, Koshkin collapsed. A medical examination revealed that he caught pneumonia and needed an operation on a lung abscess. The doctor's efforts were in vain, and on September 26, 1940, Mikhail Ilyich Koshkin died.\" The latter itself cites L. Vasilyeva's *Mihkail Koshkin: Unikalniye dokumenty, fotografii, fakty, i vospominaniya* (Михаил Кошкин: уникальные документы, фотографии, факты, и воспоминания) Izdat, 2008 (p. 107).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 41:52 \"The 8th Mechanized Corps went as [sic?] 500 km march in June of 1941, in good weather, lost half of its tanks due to mechanical breakdowns by the time they'd arrived.\"\n\nIt's true that Major General D. I. Riabyshev, the commander of 8th Mechanized Corps, noted that his unit \"marched an average of 495 km before joining battle and abandoned more than 50% of its combat vehicles along the road.\" (Glantz 1998, p. 135). However, those weren't all T-34s. At the start of the war, on 22 June 1941, the 8th Mechanized Corps only had [115 T-34s, of a total of 932](https://i.imgur.com/wJr1QZM.jpg) tanks. That's 12%. 80% were old tanks, and, like Zaloga put it: \"The readiness of the older tanks varied and was [the Red Army's] principal Achilles heel. [...] Even though the bulk of the older tanks in this category were nominally ready for action, in fact many were mechanically exhausted with excessive engine hours. Furthermore, spare parts were often lacking, meaning that even minor shortcomings such as damaged tracks left the tanks inoperable or prone to rapid breakdown. On average, Soviet tanks had already accumulated about half their engine time on the eve of the war, making them very susceptible to breakdown after typical long road marches to the battle zone\" (Zaloga 2015, Ch. 4).\n\nSo, yeah, not the best argument against the T-34 specifically.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 41:02 \"Now this was actually a fairly common occurrence...\"\n\nCitation needed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 42:03 \"...and even by 1944, the famous tank riders would be writing about their frustrations regarding how often the T-34 would break down and they'd be forced to catch up on foot.\"\n\nI guess this is evidence that Lazerpig didn't list all of his sources. Evgeni Bessonov, in *Tank Rider: Into the Reich with the Red Army* (2003), at page 77, does write about early 1944: \"We did not have many tanks left, and even those that remained had already used up their engine lifetime and were constantly breaking down. The tank that I was on with my soldiers also broke down. After a day-long stop in a village (we were already in the Western Ukraine), our tank stopped and would not move on. The battalion commander ordered me to stay with the tank and wait for it to be repaired. A day passed by and in the morning the tank crew told us that the breakdown was serious and we were stuck for a long time. I decided not to wait for the completion of the repairs, but to catch up with the battalion on foot.\" However, this is one tank rider, and we don't know for what distance or how many hours the tanks in his unit had operated. Let's not overgeneralise.\n\nBessonov would continue to say (p. 177): \"Sometimes tanks broke down and had to stop for small repairs. In such cases the tank riders would as a rule stay with the tank. But if a tank needed more serious repair, the tank riders would travel along on another tank. One of our tanks broke down, and Sergeant Nikolai Savkin with his squad stayed in that village.\" He doesn't seem frustrated to me.\n\nThese are the only two mentions I could find in the book. So it was just one tank rider writing about it, he wasn't really frustrated, and it didn't really happen that often.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne admittedly funny Stalin impression later:\n\n&gt; 43:38 \"Here, the suggestion, if you weren't listening to my perfect Stalin impression, was that the breakdowns were occurring due to crew sabotage, the soldiers who didn't want to fight purposely sabotaging their vehicles. There are no records if or not the mentioned technicians did find any sabotage vehicles.\"\n\nMaybe, but we do have this from an interview with Dmitriy Loza: \"I have already mentioned that we had a SMERSH officer in each battalion. God forbid that you abandon a tank! We had a few cases where before an attack a crewmember loosened the track on his tank. It didn't take much effort by the driver-mechanic to throw the loose track. But our SMERSH officer took note of this and rounded up the guilty parties. Of course, it was brazen cowardice!\"\n\nSources:\n\n* Peter Samsonov – Designing the T-34, Genesis of the Revolutionary Soviet Tank (2019)\n* David M.

All the other sights, however like the wide view for the gunner, the commander, and even the periscope for the driver, were shit.\"\n\nNo, they were not shit. At least not universally. But faulty generalisations are the theme of the moment. \n\nDue to shortages in the raw materials used for the production of optical glass, unavailability of many qualified personnel, and evacuation of factories, the quality of lens material degraded between August 1941 and October 1943. Eventually, \"surviving optical glass and instrument specialists were recalled from the front, and both special equipment for the production and treatment of optical glass and the raw materials for it were ordered and obtained from the US through Lend-Lease.\" Thus, \"the quality of Soviet tank sights during the second half of the war improved substantially.\" This supposedly happened in autumn 1942 (Kavalerchik 2015, p. 197).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 45:07 \"Later versions used copulas [sic] copied from the German tank designs, but these had narrower slights [sic] and offered a very limited view.\"\n\nI found no evidence that the Soviets copied the cupola from the German tank designs. And cupolas weren't something new. They had one on the bloody T-18.\n\nThey had periscopes in addition to the slits (Pulham &amp; Kerrs 2021, Ch. 32). Early Sherman cupolas didn't have slits at all. The T-34 cupolas might not have offered the best visibility, but between the vision ports and the periscope the commander could see just fine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 45:14 \"Periscopes provided to the rest of the crew, if Factory 183 ever bothered to put them on, rather than being made of mirror and glass were in fact made of highly polished metal.\"\n\nUTZ 183 \"bothered to put them on\" when they were available. Because of, you guessed it, shortages! As a side note, 'mirror' is not a material like glass or metal. It's a reflective surface that uses a metal coating to reflect light. The T-34's polished steel periscopes only used metal, whereas prior and later periscopes used more traditional mirrors that also incorporated glass. \"The first T-34s had mirror periscopes for the driver and in the turret. These consisted of a box with mirrors installed above and below at an angle to each other, made not of glass (which might burst from shell shock) but of polished steel. [...] tanks were still only provided with steel mirrors during the first year of the war. Later the mirrors were replaced by prismatic observation devices, in which a glass prism was inserted into the periscope.\" (Drabkin 2006, pp. 35-36)\n\nInterestingly enough, the switch to polished steel happened after a trial from 22 April 1940 which found the glass cracked (Kavalerchik 2018, Ch. 9.6), so not only were the periscopes of the T-34 not made of \"polished metal\" until the end of the war, they weren't even at the start. Steel was only used for about one year, between 1940 and 1941.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 45:31 \"The scopes were unheated and badly sealed meaning they had a tendency to fog up or filled with moisture and freeze making them basically unusable.\"\n\nDid any WW2 tank have heated scopes? As far as I know, defog heating was only a thing in planes. The notion that the Soviets were somehow behind in this area is dubious at best. Quite the opposite—if anything, it seems they were the only ones to introduce such a system before the war ended. The Chieftain mentions that the T-34's gun sight got a heater in January 1945 (Chieftain's Hatch 2014, 5:13), and there's some talk online about how the TSh-16 is a TSh-15 with electrical heating for defogging. However, I couldn't find any other mention in any of the books or manuals I read, and not just that. Further investigation led me to believe this heating device may have never existed even on the T-34. I've managed to ask the Chieftain about it and he doesn't seem to remember where he got the info, but suspects he got it from Yuri Pasholok, who accompanied him for the shooting of the video. Pasholok, however, says there was no such thing. So, I don't know. Maybe there's some misunderstanding somewhere. This is what my research revealed. Make of it what you will.\n\nAnyway, the Soviets did find that \"in conditions of reduced visibility (fog), the PT-6's sight head fogs up within 3–5 minutes up to the complete loss of vision\" (Kavalerchik 2018, Appendix I), but that was in 1940. The Soviets later switched to the PT-7, PT-4-7, and so on. I don't know if the problem persisted, but the burden of proof does not stand with me. Kavalerchik does complain about the polished steel mirrors, saying that \"because of the poor hermetic sealing of the device's body often fogged up in the summer, iced over in the winter, and over time oxidized\" (ibid. Ch. 9.6), but as we saw above, these were only in service for a year. Starting in 1943, they used MK-4 observation devices, which were basically Gundlach periscopes copied from the British (ibid.; Pulham &amp; Kerrs 2021, Ch. 32; Zaloga 2019, p. 13).\n\nTo conclude, most of these complaints about the vision devices don't really apply for the second half of the war.\n\nSources:\n\n* Boris Kavalerchik – Once Again About the T-34, The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1 (2015)\n* Francis Pulham, Will Kerrs – T-34 Shock: The Soviet Legend in Pictures (2021)\n* Artem Drabkin – T-34 in Action (2006)\n* Boris Kavalerchik – The Tanks of Operation Barbarossa: Soviet versus German Armour on the Eastern Front (2018)\n* Nicholas Moran – Inside the Chieftain's Hatch: T-34-85, Episode 2 (2014)\n* Steven J.

        "text": "# Larger Implications\n\n&gt; 35:47 \"All tanks have their serious flaws [...] However, none of the above mentioned tanks [(British, German, French)] have a failure rate that can match the T-34 both in terms of just how often it would break down or be destroyed in battle.\"\n\nI have previously showed that the T-34's reliability improved considerably in the second half of the war. In fact, it improved beyond that of German tanks of the time, which had degraded. Therefore it is incorrect to say that no British, French, and especially no German tank could match the break down rate of the T-34. The same goes for losses in combat. A tank fielded in massive numbers will inevitably see comparatively more losses in terms of absolute numbers than one barely produced. The T-34 also saw combat for the vast majority of the war, from 1941 to 1945.\n\nBesides, loss rates alone don't give a faithful assessment of the competency of a vehicle as they ignore the strategic and operational circumstances in which these losses took place. One is the issue of the still developing tactics of Soviet tank units, where training was often hastened and units deployed poorly into battle (Forczyk 2007, p. 48). For example, during the Battle of Kursk: \"The 5th Guards Tank Army, they had 850 tanks. If they had used them all in one single counterattack, the 2nd SS Panzer Corps, I think, would have been in trouble\" (Töppel 2019, 1:21). \"The Germans noticed that at this time. When you read the German after-action reports and war diaries, you see that they [...] say we are lucky that the Russians have masses of tanks but they only use them piecemeal\" (ibid. 1:46). \"The Red Army had not recovered from these terrible losses during the 1937-38 to the purges, and of course also the commanders that were killed in the first war years, and so they had a problem on a command level. You can read this in Russian books, modern history books too, that they really had not learned yet how to lead and coordinate [...] and employ such great tank masses\" (ibid. 2:17). Had the tanks involved in the soviet attack been Shermans or Pz.IVs given the same orders, the results would have likely been the same.\n\nIn essence, Lazerpig puts too much focus on the technical specifications of the T-34 and not enough on the other aspects of Soviet performance. Arguably one of the most important area in which the Soviets were lacking was coordinating their armoured forces. Stalin's purges had crippled the Red Army's leadership at multiple levels. And the Soviets were not the only ones suffering from this. German success in general was thanks to how well they coordinated their panzers. Even in 1940, the French did not coordinate their theoretically superior tanks, instead using them piecemeal. \"The decisive cause for the German success in battle against French tanks was the fact that the French always fought against the regiment only with a small number of tanks. Therefore it was possible to destroy them with the concentrated fire of our relatively few armor-defeating weapons. It could lead to a very difficult situation if the French employed a large number of Somua tanks against us.\" (Jentz 1996, p. 123)\n\nSources:\n\n* Robert Forczyk – Panther vs T-34: Ukraine 1943 (2007)\n* Military History not Visualized – [Soviet Tank Doctrine - Kursk 1943 featuring Dr. Roman Töppel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWp1I_zGeow) (2019)\n* Thomas L.

He first mentions it at around 7:52.\n\nI'm not sure what he means exactly by \"some of the worst\" and will presume he doesn't mean the actual worst. Because it's STZ that probably produced the actual worst T-34s, but that was to be expected. \"Due to the poor conditions at STZ, especially during the Battle of Stalingrad, the quality of STZ tanks was always less than that of other factories\" (Pulham &amp; Kerrs 2021, Ch. 25). At the same time, UTZ 183 also produced some of the best T-34s. In 1942, it \"was producing T-34s with noticeably better quality than all other tank makers. The fact that in autumn 1941 the Kharkov Locomotive Factory—the cradle of the T-34—had been evacuated to Nizhny Tagil and combined with the local train car factory contributed to this in no small way. The UTF arose on this solid base, inheriting its number (183) from the Kharkovites\" (Kavalerchik 2015, p. 189). The T-34-85 captured in Korea was a 1945 UTZ 183 model and the CIA \"study concluded that [it] was an excellent tank\" (Zaloga 2006, p. 75). UTZ also spearheaded quality control for the T-34. One example is when \"the Nizhni-Tagil design bureau had been pressing the GABTU to allow them to impose greater uniformity on the several plants manufacturing the T-34-85 and to put more emphasis on quality control at the subcontracting plants\" (Zaloga 2015, Ch. 8).\n\nSources:\n\n* Francis Pulham, Will Kerrs – T-34 Shock: The Soviet Legend in Pictures (2021)\n* Boris Kavalerchik – Once Again About the T-34, The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1 (2015)\n* Steven J.

That's an impressive 26,000 tanks, more tanks than most nations had in total during the war. How the fuck did they do that? Well, gigantification is a factor. Factory 183 was fucking huge and could therefore produce way more tanks than smaller factories. However, there's another more obvious factor. In 1941, it took 8,000 man-hours to build one complete T-34. Factory 183, by 1943, had gotten this down to 3,700 hours. How? Well, they made shortcuts.\"\n\nThis section is mostly correct, except for the last sentence. In essence, Lazerpig suggests that UTZ built a lot of tanks because it was big and because it cut production costs. So far so good. However, he goes on to imply that shortcuts were the only reason costs decreased, or at least the only one worth mentioning. This is an oversimplification. They didn't just cut corners. \"The amount of work needed to manufacture a T-34 tank declined through the war due to efficiencies and automation\" (Zaloga 2015, p. 38). \"The wide use of welding, cold forging and casting enabled a substantial increase in labour productivity and reduced the tanks' cost of production\" (Kavalerchik 2018, Ch. 9.1). \"The incredible rate of tank production was in part due to mechanical engineer Yevgeny Oskarovich Paton, who designed a portable fusion welder. Nikita Khrushchev recalled: 'Thanks to the improvements he introduced in our tank production, tanks started coming off our assembly lines like pancakes off a griddle.'\" (Tucker-Jones 2021, Ch. 4). These are important aspects that Lazerpig omits. In addition, the next part of the video is dedicated to listing what he considers to be shortcuts which negatively affected the T-34's performance. So the real point he's trying to make is that UTZ decided to cut corners so they could produce innumerable tanks, all at the cost of vehicle performance. This is an overgeneralisation. Many of the modifications were more due to shortages than a desire to further increase production, and were temporary; one was not even a shortcut, but an original design decision, and not that detrimental to performance; but I'll cover them later, one by one, as they are mentioned.\n\nIt's worth looking at [how costs evolved](https://i.imgur.com/MJUgLgf.png) in other factories throughout the war. Notice how man-hour requirements decreased continuously. Quality decreased in the first half of the war, before going back up, but costs only went down. This suggest there is little correlation between the T-34's quality and how long it took to build. Kavalerchik puts it perfectly: \"Soviet [...] engineers were able to improve [...] reliability and length of service life, and did this while the pace of production output grew relentlessly\" (Kavalerchik 2018, Ch. 9.1).\n\nSources: \n\n* Steven J.

Lights. Tanks don't need those. Now crews can't see in the dark.\"\n\nLazerpig fails to mention this change was short-lived. \"Later in production, after the move to UTZ 183, but before the implementation of the hexagonal turret, headlights were removed entirely, then re-introduced\" (Pulham &amp; Kerrs 2021, Ch. 16).\n\nSources:\n\n* Francis Pulham, Will Kerrs – T-34 Shock: The Soviet Legend in Pictures (2021)\n\n# Waterproofing\n\n&gt; 39:16 \"During rain, even light rain, the hatches would leak, causing water to drip over the electronics inside and short them out, and this often meant that the turret motor would seize and have to be manually cranked which was not easy given the lack of room inside.\"\n\nAberdeen mentions the possibility of the \"electrical equipment becoming disabled\" due to leaks, but specifically notes \"heavy rain\" (Kavalerchik 2015, p. 194). Regardless, this was not a universal issue. Normally the T-34 had rubber seals, \"but in the beginning of 1942 the USSR was experiencing a severe rubber shortage. Factories that were producing the raw materials for manufacturing it were located in the western regions of the country, and, because of the German advance, were forced to evacuate and started their production in new locations. As a result, from November 1941 through May 1942 industry operated only with prewar reserves and Lend-Lease natural rubber. Therefore, there was an attempt to economize on rubber in every possible way, and it was supplied only where it was absolutely necessary.\" In addition, \"to reduce production's labor consumption and because of the shortage of machine tools, they stopped finish-machining parts, especially hulls, except in those cases where it was completely impossible to manage without it. This resulted in an increase in the clearance between the parts. As a result of such measures the watertight integrity of the T-34's hull also suffered\" (ibid. p. 195).\n\nBasically, this is a faulty generalisation.\n\nSources:\n\n* Boris Kavalerchik – Once Again About the T-34, The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1 (2015)\n\n# Radios\n\n&gt; 39:35 \"Internal radios. Who needs those? In fact only the command tank would have the radio...\"\n\nThis is another faulty generalisation. The lack of radios was an issue that only affected some batches of the T-34, whereas Lazerpig makes it sound like a universal problem. Even worse, in his sarcasm, he seems to be implying that the Soviets were idiots who thought they were fine simply using signal flags.\n\nThe Soviets didn't just decide their tanks didn't need radios. In fact, \"the Red Army intended to make widespread use of radios, but cost and poor radio technology limited it.\" Soviet use of radios decreased at first due to shortages, then increased again as production improved (Zaloga 2015, Ch. 1). \"Not all T-34 tanks were equipped with radios, though the proportion grew as the war progressed. At the beginning of the war, the company commander's tank was nearly always fitted with a 71-TK-3 transmitter/receiver, and efforts were made to provide a similar set to platoon leaders\" (Zaloga 1994, p. 37). In 1943, the \"production of tank radios was two and a half times greater than in 1942. As a result, all new tanks were supposed to be equipped with radios, making coordinated tank tactics easier to accomplish. In practice, about 75 to 80 per cent had functional radios by the summer of 1943, but even this was a vast improvement\" (Zaloga 1994, p. 33). \"About 80% of T-34s were equipped with the 9R AM radio by late 1943\" (Forczyk 2007, p. 34). \"More radios were issued to the tanks, and by the time the cupola was introduced in August 1943, nearly every tank had a radio\" (Pulham &amp; Kerrs 2021). By 1944, the 9-R radio was installed \"on all T-34-85s, without exception\" (Kavalerchik 2015, p. 205).\n\nSources:\n\n* Steven J.

Yes, some T-34s lacked internal seating, and mostly for the hull gunner who would just find a box or something.\"\n\nCitation needed. He includes [some footage](https://i.imgur.com/6QTBQeo.png), but that looks like something filmed in the modern day. I skimmed my sources and found nothing about seats not being installed. Neither Kavalerchik's harsh but fair articles, nor Michulec's harsh and unfair *Mythical Weapon* mention anything.\n\n# Heat treating!\n\n&gt; 40:10 \"Heat treating! Do we really need to heat treat all the metal? I mean, not all of it is going to be under fire, so the internal components like the gearbox, the driveshaft, etc., etc. were not heat treated and prone to excessive grinding which wore them down faster.\"\n\nAnother faulty generalisation. As with everything, the quality of the heat treatment varied depending on the place and time. The Americans criticised the heat treatment of the gears, particularly the teeth, not the whole gearbox, and that of the suspension springs, though heat treatment was not the only factor that affected their performance. Shortages in various materials were also a factor (Kavalerchik 2015, pp. 199, 202-203). The heat treatment of other internal components is not mentioned. There's no reason to believe this did not improve by the end of the war. At the very least, the 1945 built T-34-85 recovered from Korea had good heat treatment on its internal parts. Funnily enough, the transmission gears were an exception to this, but they weren't as fragile as the ones on the Aberdeen T-34. At the same time, some parts were \"unnecessarily heat treated thus adding to production costs\" (CIA 1951, p. 299). However, \"In general, the accompanying heat treatment seemed equally well suited to requirements, and control seemed quite satisfactory\" (ibid. p. 11).\n\nSources: \n\n* Boris Kavalerchik – Once Again About the T-34, The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1 (2015)\n* CIA-RDP81-01044R000100070001-4: Engineering Analysis of the Russian T-34-85 (1951)\n\n# The turret basket\n\n&gt; 40:25 \"Turret basket! You know that platform the gunner and the loader stand on so they're always lined up with where the gun is pointing? Don't need that. They can just turn around like real men and learn to duck so they don't get smacked in the head by that breach every time the turret moves.\"\n\nThe gunner doesn't stand. He has a seat. As for the loader, that's sadly the price you have to pay to stow ammo in the hull floor—it has to be accessible, and a turret floor gets in the way.\n\nTo clarify, as with many aspects of tank design, this is a matter of compromise. Having a turret floor is great, but it restricts access to the space beneath it. The best example of this is the Sherman, which went from a full turret basket to a half basket with no walls at all and no floor under the loader.\n\nLazerpig previously criticised the T-34 for placing fuel tanks \"in the fighting compartment, with the crew.\" Early, 'Dry Stowage' Shermans stored ammo in a similar way, all over the crew compartment (as did many other tanks). \"Penetration from nearly anywhere in the frontal arc would bring a projectile in contact with ammunition\". This and \"the propensity of American crews to pile in added ammunition\" led to burn rates of 60-80%; 'Wet Stowage' decreased that to 10-15% (Zaloga 1993, pp. 15-16). In case you don't know what 'Wet Stowage' is, there's [a brilliant post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4kdbx6/tanks_what_exactly_is_a_wet_ammo_rack_are_the/) over on /r/AskHistorians that discusses it in good detail. Essentially, ammo was moved to the hull floor, where it was a lot less likely to get hit. There was also a 'quenching solution' (hence the term 'wet'), but it was ultimately found to have little to no effect. The location was the most important aspect.\n\n75 mm 'Wet' Shermans still had a turret floor, storing most of the ammo under it. This ammo was accessible via some hatches, as seen [here](http://the.shadock.free.fr/sherman_minutia/manufacturer/m4a375w/m4a375w_27.jpg). Only 4 rounds were stored above, in a sort of ready rack (1). As you might imagine, accessing the rounds in the hull was not easy. The 76 mm variants got rid of the floor under the loader entirely, as seen [here](http://the.shadock.free.fr/sherman_minutia/manufacturer/m4a376w/m4a376w_49.jpg).\n\nSherman crews weren't happy about it, but as I said, it's the price you have to pay. \"Dean Klefman: “I've crewed two versions of the Sherman, the M4A3E8 'Easy 8' and the 'Grizzly'. The Easy 8 is the Cadillac of the Shermans, a really fine tank; but it has one bad feature, and that's a half-basket. The turret basket on this model is only under the TC and the gunner; the loader stands on the hull floor when he isn't sitting down.”\" (Halberstadt 1997, p. 66) People echo this sentiment to this day, even if they haven't fought in the tank. I've held baffling conversations that made me realise I actually have to defend the design decision of sacrificing the turret floor to store ammo in the hull floor. I won't do that, but at the very least I hope I've proven it's not the bad design choice some make it out to be.\n\nAnd the Sherman was not the only other tank to feature a distinct lack of turret flooring. There's also the Pershing; \"there was no turret basket in the Pershing\" (Zaloga 2017, p. 28). Funnily enough, the prototype had one, but \"the turret basket and ammunition stowage were roundly criticized, leading to a redesign that largely removed most of the basket and increased 90mm ammunition stowage\" (ibid. p. 20). Case in point.\n\nAnother example of a tank without a turret basket is the Panzer III, a vehicle that is often compared to the early T-34 and noted to be ergonomically superior, and rightfully so. However, it has neither a turret floor nor a loader seat (Chieftain's Hatch 2018, 7:26). To clarify, the Panzer III Ausf. A through H did have a seat for the loader, and you'll find this 'Ladeschuetzensitz' mentioned throughout Panzer Tracts (Jentz &amp; Doyle 2006, pp. 36, 60; Jentz &amp; Doyle 2007, pp. 64, 70, 74; Jentz &amp; Doyle 2009, pp. 10-11), but the \"Pz.Kpfw.III Ausf.J with a 5 cm Kw.K.39 (L/60) did not have a Ladeschuetzensitz (loader's seat) installed\" (Jentz &amp; Doyle 2009, p. 40). \"There was no turret floor, so the loader had to walk on the hull floor as the turret traversed\" (Rottman 2008, p. 18). \"The loader, who stands on the right­hand side of the gun, has no seat and must therefore walk around with the turret as it traverses\" (Green 2000, p. 46).\n\nThe Centurion didn't have a turret basket floor either (Chieftain's Hatch 2016, 9:07). The M24 Chaffee didn't have a basket at all (Chieftain's Hatch 2013, 0:15).\n\nNicholas Moran summarises it pretty well: \"And, of course, there is no turret platform. Certainly you got places for you gunner and your commander to put their seats, but the loader, if he's got to be reaching for things that are not conveniently located, he's got to watch where his feet go. But he does actually have a place that he can sit and the rounds are small enough that it's not so necessary for him to be on his feet anyway. Because they're easy enough to manhandle inside the tank and of course he's got all this room on his side of the tank.\" (Moran 2018, 13:12)\n\nSources:\n\n* Steven J.

The T-34 has steel road wheels on steel tracks [...]\"\n\nJust as with the radios, rubber was used when it was available. Some late KhPZ 183 T-34s had idler wheels that lack rubber; you know, since \"the Wehrmacht was not only close to Kharkov, but getting ever closer to Moscow\" (Pulham &amp; Kerrs 2021, Ch. 17). The biggest shortage was in Stalingrad, where, after a while, tanks began being built with \"cast road wheels [that] lacked any external rubber but had internal shock absorbers\" (ibid. Ch. 23). \n\n\"In November 1942, the rearmost road wheel was replaced. Originally a cast spider type was put onto the fifth position, but it was replaced with a fourth cast steel-rimmed type road wheel. This was done as supplies of rubber road wheels for UTZ 183 were running short, therefore the minimum amount of rubber was used. It should be noted however that all of the other factories were increasing the amount of rubber road wheels used\" (ibid. Ch. 31). UTZM, meanwhile, had no such issues when it \"began T-34 production in August 1942\", using all rubber-rimmed wheels, \"likely due to UTZM receiving their shipments of wheels from a different subsidiary than UTZ\" (ibid. Ch. 34).\n\nKavalerchik covers this topic too, albeit in less detail than *T-34 Shock*. I've already quoted him on rubber shortages on the topic of waterproofing, but he also mentions rubber wheels: \"As one of the measures of this [rubber] economization, from January 1942 through August 1943 road wheels on T-34 tanks were provided with internal rubber cushioning instead of solid tires\" (Kavalerchik 2015, p. 195).\n\nAnd do you know who else did that? The Germans. When Germany began having its own rubber shortages they did the exact same thing. Hilary L. Doyle says in a Chieftain video: \"Rubber eventually was to be only used for things that couldn't be done effectively with any other medium, so gradually they were replacing any wheels they could—like the return rollers could be a steel roller, they could get away with that. Then they were introducing steel tired road wheels where the rubber was still there but it was inside the wheel where it was protected and lasted longer\" (Chieftain's Hatch 2020, 9:40).\n\nAnyway, point is this was not an universal issue. Lazerpig shows one picture of a rubber-rimmed T-34, but otherwise this entire section sounds like another faulty generalisation. And he doesn't stop there. Next, he dumps a list of various parts which were omitted when times were desperate. Frankly, this entire section, as well as the arguments leading to it, disingenuously paint the T-34 as a worse tank than it actually was by implying it universally suffered from issues it didn't universally suffer from.\n\nSources: \n\n* Francis Pulham, Will Kerrs – T-34 Shock: The Soviet Legend in Pictures (2021)\n* Boris Kavalerchik – Once Again About the T-34, The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1 (2015)\n* Nicholas Moran – Inside the Chieftain's Hatch: Panzer IV Pt 3 (2020)\n\n# More reliability talk\n\n&gt; 41:42 \"The designer who was driving the tank at the time was so exhausted he caught pneumonia during the trip and fucking died.\"\n\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with either the design or the build quality of the tank. The poor man fell into a freezing river.\n\nAccording to Igor Zheltov: \"On the way from Moscow to Kharkov, the tank fell into the river, the designer fell into icy water and thus thoroughly undermined his health. Until that moment, he worked for wear and tear, and the cold finally knocked him down.\" This is also noted in Peter Samsonov's *Designing the T-34* (p. 51): \"Early at the start of the drive, the tank Koshkin was riding in slipped and fell into a river. Upon his return to the factory, Koshkin collapsed. A medical examination revealed that he caught pneumonia and needed an operation on a lung abscess. The doctor's efforts were in vain, and on September 26, 1940, Mikhail Ilyich Koshkin died.\" The latter itself cites L. Vasilyeva's *Mihkail Koshkin: Unikalniye dokumenty, fotografii, fakty, i vospominaniya* (Михаил Кошкин: уникальные документы, фотографии, факты, и воспоминания) Izdat, 2008 (p. 107).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 41:52 \"The 8th Mechanized Corps went as [sic?] 500 km march in June of 1941, in good weather, lost half of its tanks due to mechanical breakdowns by the time they'd arrived.\"\n\nIt's true that Major General D. I. Riabyshev, the commander of 8th Mechanized Corps, noted that his unit \"marched an average of 495 km before joining battle and abandoned more than 50% of its combat vehicles along the road.\" (Glantz 1998, p. 135). However, those weren't all T-34s. At the start of the war, on 22 June 1941, the 8th Mechanized Corps only had [115 T-34s, of a total of 932](https://i.imgur.com/wJr1QZM.jpg) tanks. That's 12%. 80% were old tanks, and, like Zaloga put it: \"The readiness of the older tanks varied and was [the Red Army's] principal Achilles heel. [...] Even though the bulk of the older tanks in this category were nominally ready for action, in fact many were mechanically exhausted with excessive engine hours. Furthermore, spare parts were often lacking, meaning that even minor shortcomings such as damaged tracks left the tanks inoperable or prone to rapid breakdown. On average, Soviet tanks had already accumulated about half their engine time on the eve of the war, making them very susceptible to breakdown after typical long road marches to the battle zone\" (Zaloga 2015, Ch. 4).\n\nSo, yeah, not the best argument against the T-34 specifically.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 41:02 \"Now this was actually a fairly common occurrence...\"\n\nCitation needed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 42:03 \"...and even by 1944, the famous tank riders would be writing about their frustrations regarding how often the T-34 would break down and they'd be forced to catch up on foot.\"\n\nI guess this is evidence that Lazerpig didn't list all of his sources. Evgeni Bessonov, in *Tank Rider: Into the Reich with the Red Army* (2003), at page 77, does write about early 1944: \"We did not have many tanks left, and even those that remained had already used up their engine lifetime and were constantly breaking down. The tank that I was on with my soldiers also broke down. After a day-long stop in a village (we were already in the Western Ukraine), our tank stopped and would not move on. The battalion commander ordered me to stay with the tank and wait for it to be repaired. A day passed by and in the morning the tank crew told us that the breakdown was serious and we were stuck for a long time. I decided not to wait for the completion of the repairs, but to catch up with the battalion on foot.\" However, this is one tank rider, and we don't know for what distance or how many hours the tanks in his unit had operated. Let's not overgeneralise.\n\nBessonov would continue to say (p. 177): \"Sometimes tanks broke down and had to stop for small repairs. In such cases the tank riders would as a rule stay with the tank. But if a tank needed more serious repair, the tank riders would travel along on another tank. One of our tanks broke down, and Sergeant Nikolai Savkin with his squad stayed in that village.\" He doesn't seem frustrated to me.\n\nThese are the only two mentions I could find in the book. So it was just one tank rider writing about it, he wasn't really frustrated, and it didn't really happen that often.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne admittedly funny Stalin impression later:\n\n&gt; 43:38 \"Here, the suggestion, if you weren't listening to my perfect Stalin impression, was that the breakdowns were occurring due to crew sabotage, the soldiers who didn't want to fight purposely sabotaging their vehicles. There are no records if or not the mentioned technicians did find any sabotage vehicles.\"\n\nMaybe, but we do have this from an interview with Dmitriy Loza: \"I have already mentioned that we had a SMERSH officer in each battalion. God forbid that you abandon a tank! We had a few cases where before an attack a crewmember loosened the track on his tank. It didn't take much effort by the driver-mechanic to throw the loose track. But our SMERSH officer took note of this and rounded up the guilty parties. Of course, it was brazen cowardice!\"\n\nSources:\n\n* Peter Samsonov – Designing the T-34, Genesis of the Revolutionary Soviet Tank (2019)\n* David M.

All the other sights, however like the wide view for the gunner, the commander, and even the periscope for the driver, were shit.\"\n\nNo, they were not shit. At least not universally. But faulty generalisations are the theme of the moment. \n\nDue to shortages in the raw materials used for the production of optical glass, unavailability of many qualified personnel, and evacuation of factories, the quality of lens material degraded between August 1941 and October 1943. Eventually, \"surviving optical glass and instrument specialists were recalled from the front, and both special equipment for the production and treatment of optical glass and the raw materials for it were ordered and obtained from the US through Lend-Lease.\" Thus, \"the quality of Soviet tank sights during the second half of the war improved substantially.\" This supposedly happened in autumn 1942 (Kavalerchik 2015, p. 197).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 45:07 \"Later versions used copulas [sic] copied from the German tank designs, but these had narrower slights [sic] and offered a very limited view.\"\n\nI found no evidence that the Soviets copied the cupola from the German tank designs. And cupolas weren't something new. They had one on the bloody T-18.\n\nThey had periscopes in addition to the slits (Pulham &amp; Kerrs 2021, Ch. 32). Early Sherman cupolas didn't have slits at all. The T-34 cupolas might not have offered the best visibility, but between the vision ports and the periscope the commander could see just fine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 45:14 \"Periscopes provided to the rest of the crew, if Factory 183 ever bothered to put them on, rather than being made of mirror and glass were in fact made of highly polished metal.\"\n\nUTZ 183 \"bothered to put them on\" when they were available. Because of, you guessed it, shortages! As a side note, 'mirror' is not a material like glass or metal. It's a reflective surface that uses a metal coating to reflect light. The T-34's polished steel periscopes only used metal, whereas prior and later periscopes used more traditional mirrors that also incorporated glass. \"The first T-34s had mirror periscopes for the driver and in the turret. These consisted of a box with mirrors installed above and below at an angle to each other, made not of glass (which might burst from shell shock) but of polished steel. [...] tanks were still only provided with steel mirrors during the first year of the war. Later the mirrors were replaced by prismatic observation devices, in which a glass prism was inserted into the periscope.\" (Drabkin 2006, pp. 35-36)\n\nInterestingly enough, the switch to polished steel happened after a trial from 22 April 1940 which found the glass cracked (Kavalerchik 2018, Ch. 9.6), so not only were the periscopes of the T-34 not made of \"polished metal\" until the end of the war, they weren't even at the start. Steel was only used for about one year, between 1940 and 1941.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 45:31 \"The scopes were unheated and badly sealed meaning they had a tendency to fog up or filled with moisture and freeze making them basically unusable.\"\n\nDid any WW2 tank have heated scopes? As far as I know, defog heating was only a thing in planes. The notion that the Soviets were somehow behind in this area is dubious at best. Quite the opposite—if anything, it seems they were the only ones to introduce such a system before the war ended. The Chieftain mentions that the T-34's gun sight got a heater in January 1945 (Chieftain's Hatch 2014, 5:13), and there's some talk online about how the TSh-16 is a TSh-15 with electrical heating for defogging. However, I couldn't find any other mention in any of the books or manuals I read, and not just that. Further investigation led me to believe this heating device may have never existed even on the T-34. I've managed to ask the Chieftain about it and he doesn't seem to remember where he got the info, but suspects he got it from Yuri Pasholok, who accompanied him for the shooting of the video. Pasholok, however, says there was no such thing. So, I don't know. Maybe there's some misunderstanding somewhere. This is what my research revealed. Make of it what you will.\n\nAnyway, the Soviets did find that \"in conditions of reduced visibility (fog), the PT-6's sight head fogs up within 3–5 minutes up to the complete loss of vision\" (Kavalerchik 2018, Appendix I), but that was in 1940. The Soviets later switched to the PT-7, PT-4-7, and so on. I don't know if the problem persisted, but the burden of proof does not stand with me. Kavalerchik does complain about the polished steel mirrors, saying that \"because of the poor hermetic sealing of the device's body often fogged up in the summer, iced over in the winter, and over time oxidized\" (ibid.

For guns it's called muzzle velocity. And poor accuracy at... range? At what range?\n\nThe T-34 used the L-11, F-34, D-5T, and S-53 guns. For now I'll focus on the first ones, the L-11 and the F-34, and compare them to some equivalents we have data for, such as the 75 mm M2, M3, and M6 guns the US fielded. I've compiled the data in another [table](https://i.imgur.com/rXQjTw1.png). The sources are *Soviet tanks and combat vehicles of World War Two* (1984) by Steven J. Zaloga (p. 225) for the Soviet guns, except the shell named simply \"AP\" that Wikipedia got from [armchairgeneral.com](http://www.armchairgeneral.com/rkkaww2/weapons/art_tanks.htm), that in turn cites *\"Otechestvennye bronirovannye mashiny. XX vek\" : nauchnoe izdanie v 4-kh tomakh/ Solyankin A.G., Pavlov M.V., Pavlov I.V., Zheltov I.G./ Tom 1. \"Otechestvennye bronirovannye mashiny. 1905-1941\" , Moscow, Exprint, 2002*, whatever that is—feel free to ignore that one shell if you want—and the 75mm Gun M2, M3, &amp; M6 Specification Booklet made by the Sherman Tank site with data from Hunnicutt's Sherman Tank book (Hunnicutt 1978, p. 562). Do note that F-534 is actually a typo in Zaloga's book. The actual projectile was F-354.\n\nIn terms of equivalences, I'd say the short L-11 is comparable to the short M2, and the longer F-34 is comparable to the longer M3 and M6. And as you might notice, the Soviet guns had slightly higher muzzle velocities than their US equivalents in all comparable shell categories. That doesn't mean the Soviet guns were necessarily better, of course; just that Soviet guns didn't \"suffer\" from low muzzle velocities.\n\nWe'll talk about precision later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 25:17 \"Though in fairness this was not due to the gun this was due to the quality of the powder that they were using in the shells, which is why on paper this gun can rip through panzers with the sheer raw power of stalinium, but in reality was about as effective as the next few seconds of this child's life against that thing [shows a kid throwing a rock at a tank]. So, decent gun, shit shells.\"\n\nCitation needed. I couldn't find any sources criticising Soviet propellant. Not even the highly critical ones I mentioned previously brought up this issue.\n\nThe only mentions of Soviet propellant quality I found were in quite a different context, all originating from a 1944 Finish report. Zaloga writes in *T-34 vs StuG III, Finland 1944* (2019), at page 17: \"The 85 mm gun is a compact tank gun, identical to the German 88 mm tank gun in main parameters, losing out slightly in range and trajectory due to superior quality of German propellant.\" This is paraphrased by Michael Green in *Red Army Weapons of the Second World War* (2022), at page 92, specifically citing \"a Finnish Army report dated 1944\". The entirety of the report can be found in Zaloga's 2019 book and in [a 2015 TankArchives article](https://www.tankarchives.ca/2015/06/finnish-impressions-of-t-34-85.html). I suspect this article is Zaloga's source because it predates the book and has the exact phrasing. It seems the article is a translation from Russian to English of a Soviet report which itself is a translation of a captured Finish document.\n\nThe \"German 88 mm tank gun\" the Finns mentioned must be the KwK 36, not the KwK 43, because otherwise the comparison would make no sense. Regardless, the conclusion still doesn't make sense if you look at the muzzle velocities of the two guns. Seeing how the KwK 36 had a muzzle velocity of 773 m/s with its APCBC shell (Jentz &amp; Doyle 1993, p. 28) and the ZiS-S-53 of 792 m/s (Zaloga 1984, p. 225), whatever differences in \"range and trajectory\" can't be blamed on the powder, but on the aerodynamic characteristics and mass of the projectiles, as well as the characteristics of the barrels. But even if you want to trust the Finish report on this, it still only notes a slight difference, nothing close to what Lazerpig declares.\n\nAnyway, the next statements are pure hyperboles that aren't even worth addressing. I'd conclude with this: Soviet shells were indeed not amazing. However, this was not because of their powder, but because of the the projectiles themselves—although that's a can of worms I don't want to get into. This essay is long and complicated enough as it is.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 25:37 \"The amateur may look at the T-34 and marvel at its gun for being long and therefore obviously superior, the gun had only a marginally higher velocity than the main gun of the Sherman.\" \n\nI don't know what amateurs those are, because I haven't seen the 76mm T-34 guns get praised much on the internet. This sounds like another strawman to me, or at least something akin to the revolutionary slopes notion. But yes, the gun only had a marginally higher muzzle velocity compared to the M3, as shown above. So what was the whole \"low exit velocities\" thing then?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 25:52 \"The accuracy of using anything outside of solid shot AP ammunition was allegedly about 50/50 of it landing where you aimed.\"\n\nAlleged by whom? Aiming at what target? At what range? Let's look at some actual numbers.\n\nI found [one article](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2013/05/accuracy-revisited.html) that compiled data from Soviet artillery tables that can help us get a general idea. There's some debate over the interpretation of the data, but that's about a comparison with German guns tested with German criteria and doesn't affect us—the guns we'll compared were tested under the same criteria. It lists deviations at 1 km for a number of shells, with full charges. The F-34 has a 30 cm deviation firing HE, Smoke, and AP, and a 50 cm firing HEAT. These are circle radii. So at 1 km, it has a 50/50 chance of hitting a circular target of 60 and 100 cm in diameter respectively. For another example of a 50/50 chance of hitting what you aimed for we have a tank sized, 2 x 2.5 m target, at 3 km (distance at which the deviation is of 1 m).\n\nContinuing the above comparison with US equivalents, the Soviets tested the 75 mm M2 on the M3 Lee and got the same 30 cm deviation for AP shells, and a 30 cm (horizontal) by 40 cm (vertical) deviation for HE (given the lower velocities noted above, this is to be expected). Even so, this is the shorter 75 mm, so the fact that it has almost identical precision at 1 km is a good thing. However, it does decrease at longer ranges, with the tank sized target example described above happening at only about 2250 m.\n\nOverall, both guns have good precision.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 26:01 \"Several stories would later emerging regarding soviet tankers' refusal to use the supplied APCR ammunition due to its tendency to explode in the barrel if the gun was not left to cool after being fired.\"\n\nI couldn't find anything about this in my sources, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's true. The Germans had similar issues with their APCR, which sometimes affected their APC as well. \"The Panzergranatpatrone 40 is no longer fired by the crew because with each round the shell casing sticks or the shell casing ruptures in the gun. This can only be cleared from outside the Panzer by knocking the shell case back out with the cleaning rods. Shell casing ruptures occasionally occur when firing the Panzergranate 38\" (Jentz 1996, p. 243). The Panzergranate 38 was a capped armor-piercing shell (ibid. p. 287). Still, a citation would be nice.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 26:20 \"Penetration tables are typically not accepted as absolutes because they are gained from firing the gun under ideal conditions, with ideal ammunition, at ideal ranges, against solid sheet metal, and as we learned previously casting, welding, sloping, and heat treating are all ways you could increase armor protection without necessarily increasing the thickness.\"\n\nHe mentioned penetration tables twice before, but this is where he develops the idea so this is where I'll discuss it. He's absolutely right that such tables shouldn't be accepted as absolutes. Differences in methodology need to be taken into account. But the notion that everyone tested guns under ideal conditions is very much wrong. Not everyone used ideal ammunition. I don't know what he means by \"ideal ranges\". And solid \"sheet\" metal? What? Anyway:\n\nThe Germans did indeed used \"highest quality ammunition which out penetrated service rounds by about 8-10%\" but they also shot at \"superior quality test plate\" (Livingston 2001, p. 46). However, when testing enemy guns, captured service shells, not \"ideal ammunition\", were used. Livingston notes a discrepancy between the performance of 45mm APBC Soviet shells determined by the Germans and the US that could be explained by the drop in shell quality which occurred from late 1941 through early 1942 (ibid. p. 51). Meanwhile, \"the American penetration data [...] appears reasonable and is consistent with reported penetration ranges against German tanks\" (ibid. p. 56). Another example of tests downplaying the actual effectiveness of Soviet shells (not intentionally, of course) is one done by the Soviets themselves in 1943, against an early Tiger I with higher quality armour, that suggested the 76.2 mm gun could not reliably penetrate the Tiger's sides (ibid. p. 58 errata) in circumstances in which [tests over a year later](https://www.tankarchives.ca/2019/05/t-34s-vs-tiger.html) showed it could—an example of German armour quality degrading over time.\n\nPoint is, a good historian takes test criteria into account and doesn't just outright dismiss the results without a second thought.\n\nNext, he references the previous CHA superiority argument which I've already covered. Casting is actually a way to decrease protection for the same thickness. Welding doesn't affect protection, unless he means bad welds can crack. Sloping is a very important factor, yes. Heat treating is a blanket term, but if by that he means face hardening, and generally tweaking hardness, he's right. Another factor he doesn't mention is the employment of metals like nickel, as discussed under 'spalling'. Generally speaking this statement is fine, bar the few issues highlighted above and the context in which it was used.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 26:45 \"The other problem, which I will admit to, is that most statistical sources on the T-34's gun performance do not differentiate between the L-11 and the F-43...\"\n\nFirst of all, it's the F-34. There is no F-43 gun. This is probably a typo. But more importantly, the claim about sources is downright absurd. I don't know what he means by \"statistical\" sources, but all the sources I used do differentiate. His do too. I guess he could refer to things he didn't list, but honestly I can't think of any source that doesn't do it. I just compared the two guns above using a bunch of book that clearly differentiate. This is a pretty bad factual error, or at least a claim in dire need of clarification.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 26:56 \"...and the ones that do are soviet tech (tank?) diaries (what?) of which two out of the five I have read over the years I now know to be fake.\"\n\nI don't know what he means by this, nor what exactly he says. Tech diaries? Tank diaries? Is he talking about false claims in memoirs? Lies in technical documents? No idea. Clarification needed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 27:02 \"At best, what I can say is that the gun of the T-34 is rather over-hyped. Not a bad gun, but the people who marvel at it are the same people who call the Sherman's gun a pancake only suitable for blowing up trucks and armored cars.\"\n\nI can't say I encountered many instances of it being hyped in general, but OK. Regardless, the rest of the statement is the same strawman noted above, only taken to an extreme. Those are arguments often used by Wehraboos, people who would badmouth the T-34 as much as the Sherman, if not more so, and whose influence has diminished recently on the net. Also, I hope the irony of using this argument after having essentially said the same about the T-34's gun at 25:17 is not lost to him.\n\nSources:\n\n* Steven J.

This makes it more advantageous at moving through soft ground in comparison to the German tanks, the favorite example being the Panzer IV, whose narrow tracks placed the entire way to the tank into a smaller area, causing it to sink quickly into the mud. Footage then often cuts to the Type 4s which have specially fitted track extensions in order to try and alleviate this problem. And while this is true, many have interpreted this as the T-34 *never* got stuck in mud, whereas in fact it did, quite frequently.\"\n\nBonus quote from later in the video:\n\n&gt; 30:14 \"[...] the impression given is that the 34 could somehow glide through the mud like it was fucking Jesus.\"\n\nThis is reminiscent of the sloped armour strawman, with similarly gross exaggerations. Just how many people actually believe the T-34 never got stuck in mud is guesswork. I'm willing to bet that he just read one or two instances of exaggeration and overgeneralised. I'll explain why shortly.\n\nIt goes without saying that no tank is impervious to getting bogged down. The point is, as he himself noted, that the T-34 had better ground pressure than the Pz.IV and thus was less likely to suffer from this. Saying the T-34 got stuck in mud \"quite frequently\" is saying nothing. The statement is too ambiguous to be of much value.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 29:09 \"Notable publications on the T-34, as well as its Wikipedia entry, somewhat missed this statement out regards to the performance of the T-34...\"\n\nWhat notable publications? And miss what? That tanks get stuck in mud?\n\nI actually got curious and checked [the state](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=T-34&amp;oldid=1061323255#Mobility) of the T-34's Wikipedia entry just prior to his video going up. An uncited paragraph by some random editor doesn't mean much, yet I suspect it's what led to Lazerpig's claim here. And, of course, a week after he published his video, [someone changed it](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=T-34&amp;oldid=1063439428#Mobility) to a random example of T-34s getting stuck in mud one time. While a good counterexample to the previous, erroneous claim, alone it's just cherry-picking. Now the article jumps from a short paragraph about the tank's automotive parts to one instance in 1944 of the 21st Guards Tank Brigade getting bogged down, with no further context or comparison to other vehicles. This section has remained basically [unchanged](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=T-34&amp;oldid=1132175325#Mobility) since, and is in dire need of expansion.\n\n&gt; 29:16 \"...but incidents where 34 got bogged down in the mud were almost as frequent as its German counterparts.\"\n\nI'd ask for a citation but why bother? This is both a baseless and pointless claim. In terms of absolute numbers, maybe it's true, given how many T-34s there were compared to panzers, but it would still mean nothing. In terms of percentages, that's doubtful, given the track width of most panzers.\n\n# Ground pressure\n\n&gt; 29:22 \"The Tiger, for example, had wider tracks than the T-34, and with more road wheels, the Tiger's weight was spread out over 16 points of pressure as opposed to the T-34's 10, which, in spite of being half the weight of the Tiger, actually gave it the same ground pressure per square inch.\"\n\n&gt; 29:37 \"Ballpark numbers are one kilogram per centimetre cube for both the Tiger and the 76, and 1.02 centimetre cube for the 85, though people argue about these numbers all the fucking time. Zaloga claims the 34 to actually be around 0.85 kilograms per centimetre cubed and the Tiger to be 1.08, whereas Panzertruppen by Thomas L. Jentz, widely regarded as the best in his field, puts it at 0.74 for the Tiger.\"\n\nI think he means centimetres squared not cubed. Anyway, here are some numbers:\n\n* Michulec 2002 actually lists the T-34-76 at 0.62 kg/cm² and describes it as \"excellent\" and \"very close to the limits of possibility\" (p. 130). The generally negative sentiment that permeates the book can still be felt, but the approach is the exact opposite of Lazerpig's: at page 253, instead of saying the tank *wasn't* good in mud, it says it was unnecessarily good, \"overkill\", and keeps hammering how that's not an important advantage. Anyway, then it lists the T-34-85's ground pressure at 0.85 kg/cm² and suggests its because the tracks were narrowed from 550 to 500 mm. I'd wager the weight increase was a factor too. These numbers are repeated countless times. The author is vague over what exact models are being discussed, but the general impression given is that the 76 had the lower figure and the 85 the higher one. Then on page 351 he suddenly changes his mind and drops a table where the T-34-76 Model 1940 (L-11) has 0.65 kg/cm², the other T-34s (F-34 models and the T-34-85) have 0.8-0.85 kg/cm². Not very consistent, but at least we have a range.\n\n* Kavalerchik 2015 lists the T-34 at 0.72 kg/cm² (p. 198).\n\n* The report on the Korean T-34-85 wrote: \"Desirably low unit ground pressure of 10 lbs./sq.in. - our current design goal\" (p. 6). That's 0.7 kg/cm².\n\n* Zaloga 2006 lists 0.83 kg/cm² (p. 33), not 0.85 like Lazerpig says (this book's cover is shown during the claim) and doesn't mention the Tiger. Another miscitation. I guess he mixed up his sources again.\n\n* Zaloga 2019 puts the T-34 Model 1942 at 0.72 kg/cm² and the T-34-85 Model 1944 at 0.83 kg/cm² (p. 29).\n\n* Fletcher 2012 repeats the 0.85 kg/cm² figure for the T-34-85, and puts the Tiger I Ausf. E (SdKfz 181) at 0.735 kg/cm² (p. 139).\n\n* Jentz 1996 (Vol. 1 &amp; 2) list the Tiger at 0.74 kg/cm² (Vol. 1, p. 281; Vol. 2, p. 294), the T-34-76 at 0.64 kg/cm², and the T-34-85 at 0.87 kg/cm² (Vol. 1, p. 282; Vol. 2, p. 295). This is probably where Lazerpig got his Tiger figure, but he missed the T-34's.\n\n* Hart 2007 instead puts the Tiger (VEHICLES 1-250) at 1.05 kg/cm² (p. 22).\n\n* Jentz &amp; Doyle 1993 repeat the 0.735 kg/cm² Tiger figure, but also write something that might elucidate why different sources give different numbers (criteria differences): \"The unlubricated 725 mm wide, Gelandeketten (cross-country tracks) provided an acceptable ground pressure (when the tracks sank to 20 cm) of 0.735 kg/cm²\" (p. 9). These tracks were a production modification introduced in May 1942: \"Tigers with Fgst Nr 250001 through 250020 had type Kgs 63/725/120 Gelandeketten (tracks for cross-country travel) specifically designed so that tracks on the right side were a mirror image of the tracks on the left side\" (p. 12).\n\n* Jentz &amp; Doyle 2000 confirms this at page 36: \"Because of the Panzer's weight, two types of tracks—Marschkette and Verladekette (operational and transport tracks)—were needed to achieve the lowest possible ground pressure. Ground pressure of 1.11 kg/cm² is achieved with the 725 mm wide Marschkette, consisting of 96 unlubricated track links per side. The outer roadwheels are removed and the Marschkette is replaced by the Verladekette before loading the Panzer on rail cars. The ground pressure with the narrower Verladekette (520 mm wide) increases to 1.545 kg/cm².\" At page 177, under \"PANZERKAMPFWAGEN TIGER I DATA Wa Pruef 6 dated 14 December 1943 (Current as of 1 November 1943)\", ground pressure says 1.03 kg/cm², and 0.9 kg/cm² \"with tracks sinking in 20 cm\".\n\nSo let's compile the data. I don't know where Lazerpig got his 1 kg/cm² \"ballpark\" for the 76, nor his oddly specific 1.02 kg/cm² \"ballpark\" for the 85. I think that's just another factual error. All the sources above suggest both tanks are well under that. So much for \"people argue about these numbers all the fucking time\". As for the Tiger, I don't know in which of Zaloga's books he found the 1.08 kg/cm² figure. It's neither in the one he shows on screen (*T-34-85 vs M26 Pershing Korea 1950*), nor the other one in his list of sources (*T-34/85 Medium Tank 1944-45*). Anyway, it seems the low number he cites Jentz on is valid in very specific circumstances, with specific tracks, sank 20 cm (not sure how that works). It seems a more realistic number would be something between 0.9 and 1.11 kg/cm², so a bit worse than the T-34. This reminds me of the penetration tests argument. Both those and the way pressure was calculated for the Tiger were affected by difference in criteria. However, Lazerpig was quick to dismiss one while enthusiastically embracing the other.\n\nSources:\n\n* Robert Michulec – T-34 Mythical Weapon (2002)\n* Boris Kavalerchik – Once Again About the T-34, The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1 (2015)\n* CIA-RDP81-01044R000100070001-4: Engineering Analysis of the Russian T-34-85 (1951)\n* Steven J.

He adds some good points about the ammo stowage being pretty good in the T-34, then says this:\n\n&gt; 33:17 \"The average Russian crew under battle conditions could fire maybe one to two rounds per minute. Germans could fire four to five.\"\n\nFrom *The Tanks of Operation Barbarossa: Soviet versus German Armour on the Eastern Front* (2018) by Boris Kavalerchik (Ch. 9.7): \"The actual rate of fire of the T-34's main gun, which was revealed in the course of field tests at the end of 1940, didn't exceed two or three shots per minute. Only after improving its ammunition stowage in May 1941 was it able to achieve four shots per minute.\" Kavalerchik exaggerates a bit here. At the end of the book, in Appendix I, the actual report is located and reads: \"The maximum rate of fire – 5–6 rounds a minute. Fire from the halt. The shells were stored in the most conveniently located cases. The rubber mat and lid of the cases had been removed. The obtained average practical rate of fire – two rounds a minute. The rapidity of fire is insufficient.\" This is the December 1940 test. So the rate of fire did exceed 2-3 RPM in some circumstances even before the changes. Regardless, it's clear it was very low on average and the Soviets agreed it required improvement, which is why efforts were made to improve it before the Germans even invaded.\n\nIt's noted that the position of the ammo in the floor was a factor—a trade off for decreased chance of brew up. I couldn't find any data, but I expect the wet Shermans also saw a decrease in rate of fire over their more flammable, dry predecessors. Of course, the M4 had plenty of other advantages in ergonomics that mitigated this, so it still probably had more than double the fire rate of the T-34. Unfortunately, none of my sources list anything but the max fire rate, though Zaloga notes in *Sherman Medium Tank 1942–45* (1993), at page 10, about the M4(75): \"The maximum theoretical rate of fire was 20 rounds per minute, though this was seldom attempted or achieved in combat.\" And in *M4 (76mm) Sherman Medium Tank 1943-65* (2003), at page 7: \"The 76mm gun has an extremely heavy muzzle blast, such that the rate of fire when the ground is dry is controlled by the muzzle blast dust cloud. Under many conditions this dust cloud does not clear for some eight to thirty seconds.\"\n\nBooks aside, we also have some reports to reference. In 1943, Chief of Staff of the 167th Independent Tank Regiment, Captain Galonyuk wrote to the Commander of the Armoured and Mechanized Forces of the 7th Guards Army ([CAMD RF 4366-34212s-3 pp. 91-92](https://www.tankarchives.ca/2019/12/tanks-in-7th-guards-army.html)): \"It is hard to establish the rate of fire. In practice it is 4-6 RPM, a well trained crew can give 8-9 rounds per minute, but this costs great effort and cannot be held up for long, especially on the T-34 tank.\" A trial carried out in March 1941 that tested rate of fire in various circumstances produced results of between 2 and 4 RPM ([CAMD RF F.38 Op.11355 D.1-20](https://www.tankarchives.ca/2021/10/t-34-rate-of-fire-trials.html)).\n\nSo no, even prior to improvements, the most pessimistic estimates puts the fire rate at 2-3, not 1-2 RPM, and after improvements we see 4+ RPM from the T-34-76.\n\nSources:\n\n* Boris Kavalerchik – The Tanks of Operation Barbarossa: Soviet versus German Armour on the Eastern Front (2018)\n* Steven J.

This meant that T-34 units would have to wait on supply convoys catching up with them, giving them less autonomy in comparison with the German units, who could carry sleeping rolls, food, water, as well as digging tools, spare parts, inside the tank with them.\"\n\nWhen he criticised the T-34's welds 26 minutes prior, and it's fuel tank placement one minute after this, Lazerpig pointed at the many pictures of the tank on the net. Yet, somehow, he doesn't seem to have noticed the external storage on German tanks, as well as on other Allied tanks.\n\nPanzers didn't have hammerspace boots/trunks accessible from the crew compartment. They mounted boxes on the outside just like everyone else. The Panzer IV had \"a stowage box for crew baggage on the turret rear starting in March 1941\" (Jentz &amp; Doyle 2006, pp. 14, 20, 34). Before that, the crew improvised with boxes in the same area (ibid. p. 26). Turret rear boxes are iconic on German tanks. The Tiger I had them too. Pz.IIs had storage bins on the mudguards, Pz.IVs carried spare wheels on the sides of the hull (McNab 2020). On the Pz.III, \"clamps and holders on the deck plates are used to stow tools and equipment\" (Jentz &amp; Doyle 2009, p. 3; Jentz &amp; Doyle 2007, p. 8); tool stowage was usually located in the left rear, but was frequently relocated by the crew, sometimes to the right front track guards (Jentz &amp; Doyle 2007, p. 0). The Panther's original tool stowage had vertical \"straps welded to the top of the deck\" (Jentz &amp; Doyle 2003, p. 13). \"Starting in May 1943, [...] heat guards were mounted on the inside of the rear stowage boxes to shield against the intense heat from the exposed tail pipes. Starting in June 1943, holders were welded onto the left superstructure side for a sledgehammer and the track tension adjusting tool\" (ibid. p. 42). I could go on, but digging through sources for this is boring. How about some pictures? [Here's an album](https://imgur.com/a/bnJKEGM).\n\nSources:\n\n* Thomas L. Jentz, Hilary L.

I have no idea where this notion came from. In *The Tanks of Operation Barbarossa: Soviet versus German Armour on the Eastern Front* (2018), Boris Kavalerchik covers various issues with the DT machine guns of the T-34, but nowhere is such a thing mentioned. The other T-34 books don't say much about the machine gun, if they even mention it at all. I actually decided to look through a whole new set of sources for this:\n\n* Chris McNab – Soviet machine guns of World War II (2022)\n* Terence W. Lapin – The Mosin-Nagant Rifle (2007)\n* Bill Harriman – The Mosin-Nagant Rifle (2016)\n\nNothing. No mention of 7.62×54mmR cartridges not using smokeless powder. I could only find tangential info on this topic:\n\nThe T-34 was armed with DT machine guns, of the Degtyaryov family, repurposed from the DP, and used 7.62×54mmR rimmed rifle cartridges, same as the Mosin–Nagant. \"By 1908, using smokeless powder and the new spitzer bullet, [Russian ballistics experts] had developed an effective cartridge\" (Lapin 2007, p. 192). \"The Mosin-Nagant M1891 rifle should have brought Russia into the modern military age with a small-bore, smokeless repeating rifle\" (Harriman 2016, p. 76).\n\nI think this is a case of claim so utterly nonsensical that historical literature never actually had to spell out it's not true.\n\n# Fuel tanks\n\n&gt; 34:34 \"The fuel tanks. Unlike every other tank in the world, these were kept in the fighting compartment, with the crew. This is why you see so many pictures of the T-34 burnt out, with their turrets missing, having apparently exploded.\"\n\nThe T-34 was not the only tank in the world that didn't separate the crew compartment from the fuel tanks. It was a common Soviet design choice, with the IS, KV, and BT all having this problem too. And yes, the Soviets did find their fuel tanks could detonate in a rather spectacular manner, but things aren't as simple as they seem.\n\nFirst of all, what he describes are symptoms of ammunition, not fuel explosion. \"As a result of a fuel tank’s explosion, the armour plate closest to its origin would be ripped from the hull along a welding seam and blown to one side. The tank’s turret, which usually gets blown off by detonation of the on-board ammunition, would remain in place in this event\" (Kavalerchik 2018, Ch. 10). So the pictures Lazerpig shows are likely cases when the ammo brew up. Better examples of fuel tank explosions would be [these](https://imgur.com/a/5ugRZ5c). Notice the turret didn't fly out.\n\nSecond of all, the fuel tanks only exploded under very specific circumstances, based on fuel level and projectile type. The best conditions occurred when the tank was only 10-15% full, was hit with 75 mm or high calibre APHE, and the shell detonated inside it. Shaped charge jets could also ignite the fumes under these circumstances. However, as conditions diverged from this ideal scenario, the likelihood of a fuel explosion decreased drastically. Smaller calibre shells and solid shot were unlikely to cause an explosion. In fact, it seems the tanks actually protected the crew in some cases, mainly when full and against the latter shell types. Kavalerchik even writes that, \"at the beginning of the war, really only the shells of the 88mm Flak 18/36/37 gun could trigger it\" (ibid. Ch. 10), and the report from which he took most of this info suggests that instances only became notably frequent in the spring and summer battles of 1943.\n\nTo summarise, I don't think fuel explosions were a key issue of the T-34. They only occurred in specific circumstances, and you know what a lot of tanks did store in the crew compartment, in easily hit places, and also explodes? Ammunition. A crewman probably doesn't care if his tank blows up with him inside because of the ammo or because of the fuel. I will say that, despite the above, Lazerpig is still right to criticise the fuel tank placement. Even when the fuel didn't explode, it could easily light up and just burn the crew alive, an arguably worse fate, and the real tragedy of this layout. It's possible Lazerpig was also considering this, but with the second sentence pointing at explosions, I can't say for sure.\n\nSources:\n\n* Boris Kavalerchik – The Tanks of Operation Barbarossa: Soviet versus German Armour on the Eastern Front (2018)\n* Report of the NKV No. 101–1 special laboratory: Study of the details of a hit against the T-34’s fuel tanks by APHE and HEAT ammunition of the German fascist army. 11 September 1944.\n\n# Stabilisation\n\n&gt; 35:23 \"As I said, the T-34 design has its flaws, but is ultimately not bad, especially in comparison to a lot of other tanks around at the time.\"\n\n&gt; 35:30 \"Two man turrets were pretty common, British tanks also used a Christie suspension, and the driver of the early cruiser models couldn't escape unless the turret was at its zero position. German tanks were not stabilized to be able to fire on the move, and the French tanks were pathetically slow and fuel hungry.\"\n\nAlmost no tanks were stabilised to fire on the move. The Americans were pretty much the only ones that dabbled in stabilisation, and even they found that the \"lack of azimuth stabilization made the shoot-on-the-move capability more theoretical than practical\" (Green &amp; Brown 2007, p. 21). \"Because the M4 series single-plane gyrostabilizer could not control turret azimuth, it did not allow for true shoot-on-the-move capability\" (ibid. p. 87). \"Jim Francis recounts that while on level terrain the stabilizer might have proven useful. On rough terrain, the gunner and loader were bouncing up and down so much while the sights were not, thus making it impossible for the gunner to keep his eye glued to his sight and for the loader to inset a round in the breech\" (ibid. p. 88). Besides, \"since U.S. tank gunnery practice was to fire after halting, the gyroscope was most useful in keeping the gun roughly aligned to the target while moving\" (Zaloga 2008, p. 39). \"[Troops] did not attempt to fire on the move, preferring to stop before using the main weapon\" (Hunnicutt 1978, p. 215). So it did have it's advantages, but the point is no tank, not even stabilised ones, were able to accurately fire on the move. It wasn't just a Soviet and German issue.\n\nAs for the topic of firing on the move specifically on the Soviet side, which Lazerpig brought up a number of times throughout the video, the Soviets did perform some fire rate tests on the move, but shooting like that doesn't seem to have been doctrine. From an an interview with Dmitriy Loza: \"If we fired on the move, the speed of the tank did not exceed 12 km/h. But we rarely fired on the move, only in order to incite panic in the enemy ranks. Primarily we fired from short halts. We rushed into a position, stopped for a second, fired, and moved ahead.\" And I think he refers to his time in a Lend-Lease M4 here.\n\nI hope Lazerpig doesn't mean to imply the shoulder pad elevation control on smaller British guns counts as stabilisation. It's a stretch to call it that, and even if you want to, it was considerably worse than US stabilisation, and only a thing in lower calibre guns, thus not really relevant for the T-34, Sherman, etc. Even so, I'll address this notion just in case. \"In the late 1930s, some armies still used gun mounts that were free in elevation and elevated using a simple shoulder pad on the gun mount. This was adequate for very short-range engagements; however, for longer range engagements, a geared elevation system was essential so that corrections could be made after the first shot. In the U.S. Army, the transition occurred between the M3 and M3A1 light tanks. The British army still used a free-elevation system in the Matilda infantry tank and early Crusader Cruiser tanks of the 1940–41 period. The geared elevation feature became standard in most armies by 1942\" (Zaloga 2015, Ch. 1). \"One of the oddities of British tank doctrine at this point in the war [North African campaign] was the use of a shoulder pad to elevate and depress the gun instead of the usual geared system. This was linked to British tactical doctrine that favored firing on the move. Although peacetime tests suggested that good results could be obtained, the results in wartime were more likely to be very poor\" (ibid. Ch. 6).\n\nSources: \n\n* Michael Green, James D.

        "text": "The T-34 has seen a fair amount of controversy over the years. Various groups with various biases have misdescribed it one way or another, exaggerating either its strengths or its flaws, but discourse was generally civilised. A few months ago, however, I discovered that the notion the T-34 was an irredeemable tank had gained mainstream appeal in some of the communities I frequented, mainly due to a popular video that kept being referenced: Lazerpig's *The T-34 is not as good as you think it is*.\n\nI had actually watched it not long after it came out, only to give up halfway through after some particularly bad takes, but didn't think much of it otherwise. This was until I found myself arguing with a surprising number of people who hated the T-34 with a passion—not the usual suspects, but displaying similar scorn. Most of them simply parroted the same arguments Lazerpig brought forth, though some misconstrued them to comedic levels. Point is, the video popularised a lot of misconceptions and I decided to address them in depth.\n\nThanks to Intuplat, spike5716, and TankArchives for helping with research.\n\n# Build standards\n\n&gt; 6:51 \"A large number of T-34s were built after 1945, and these post World War II models were built to a much much higher standard, and are typically the ones you'll find in museums masquerading as their war-built counterparts.\"\n\nThe concept that T-34 build standards 1. only improved (or 2. only became acceptable) after the war is false. Lazerpig meant the latter (2), but I've argued with a number of his fans that took it as the former (1), so both claims are worth addressing. Multiple sources suggest the improvement was gradual and started during the war. I'll mostly focus on reliability here, but later I'll also touch on other aspects that improved over the years.\n\nFrom *The Tanks of Operation Barbarossa: Soviet versus German Armour on the Eastern Front* (2018) by Boris Kavalerchik (Ch. 9.1): \"It was only in the second half of the war, primarily thanks to the reserves of weight and space in the T-34's chassis, that Soviet designs and manufacturing engineers were able to improve these tanks with respect to the majority of the main indicators, including reliability and length of service life, and did this while the pace of production output grew relentlessly. The T-34s at the end of the war were much superior to and quite different from those which started it. A decisive turning point in the level of quality of the serially produced Soviet tanks took place in the middle of 1943. As [Chart 1](https://i.imgur.com/7SbHUgN.png) illustrates, failures in quality happened even later, but were mostly temporary than of a systemic nature.\" To clarify, Chart 1 shows the \"Percentage of serially produced Soviet T-34 tanks that covered 300 kilometres during test trials without breaking down.\"\n\nInfo from the same chart is used by Zaloga in *Armored Champion: The Top Tanks of World War II* (2015), which also notes that:\n\n* In 1943 a greater effort was made to impose quality control at the tank plants. All T-34 tanks had to undergo a 30 km test at the plant, followed by a 50 km test by military inspectors before the tank would be accepted by the army. One in a hundred tanks would also be subjected to a 300 km test run. The initial 300 km tests in April 1943 showed that only 10.1% of the tanks could pass. In June 1943 only 7.7% passed. Faults varied from plant to plant. In May 1943, the five plants producing T-34 sent five new tanks for endurance tests near Kazan. UZTM had the best results, reaching 1,001 km in 4.9 days before breakdowns. Chelyabinsk had the worst, with only 409 km in 2.8 days. The average was 710 km. Technical improvements such as the new transmission and air filters, as well as greater attention to quality control, significantly improved the durability of the new T-34 tanks, and by December 1943, 83.6% of the tanks completed the 300 km run. \n* The quality control improvements were evident on the battlefield. Combat losses due to mechanical breakdowns decreased from 8.6% in 1942 to about 2% in the Kursk campaign. In the days before the tank clash at Prokhorovka, the 5th Guards Tank Army executed a three-day forced march on 7-9 July totalling 330-380 km, a distance that would have proved debilitating a year earlier.\n* By early 1944 the T-34's reliability finally reached acceptable levels. During February 1944 tests, 79% of tanks reached 300 km, and of the test batches 33% reached 1,000 km.\n* Overall, tanks in 1943 would reach only 75% of their guaranteed life span in engine hours and mileage, but in 1944 they reached 150%.\n* By the end of the war, quality control at the tank plants continued to improve, significantly reducing attrition through mechanical breakdown. Out of the tanks and AFVs from the 1st Belorussian and 1st Ukrainian Fronts participating in the Berlin Operation only 1% failed for mechanical reasons.\n\nZaloga also notes an increase to 180-200 hours of the T-34's engine life span in 1944 in *T-34-85 Medium Tank 1944-1994* (1996), on page 21, as well as that the \"transmission endurance had been extended to about 1,200 km.\"\n\nIn *T-34: The Red Army's Legendary Medium Tank* (2015), Ch. 6, and *Stalin's Armour, 1941-1945 Soviet Tanks at War* (2021), Ch. 11, Anthony Tucker-Jones says that by 1943, Soviet T-34 units enjoyed a 70-90% reliability rate, in contrast with German Panther units which could only manage half of this. This figure is repeated in Wolfgang Fleischer's *T-34: An Illustrated History of Stalin's Greatest Tank* (2018), in the Foreword: \"in 1943 the T-34 managed an operational readiness rate of 70–90%. In contrast its rival the Panther managed just 35%.\" Robert Forczyk's *Panther vs T-34: Ukraine 1943* (2007) also notes an \"operational reliability rate of around 70-90% in most Soviet armor units in 1943\" (p. 33), as does *Why Germany Nearly Won: A New History of the Second World War in Europe* (2012) by Steven D. Mercatante (p. 237).\n\nArtem Drabkin in *T-34 in Action* (2006), Ch. 2, writes: \"The T-34s that went into combat during the first days of the war and the T-34s that burst into the streets of Berlin in April 1945 differed significantly, not only externally but also internally. But at the end of the war as well as at its beginning, Soviet tankmen saw in the T-34 a machine they could believe in. Initially their confidence came from its sloping armour that could deflect the enemy's shells, its diesel engine resistant to inflammation, and its all-defeating gun; and as the war drew to a victorious close it was its high speed, reliability, stable communications, and powerful gun which enabled them to stand up for themselves.\"\n\nThen there's Boris Kavalerchik's *Once Again About the T-34*, a 2015 article in *The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1*. It's one of the sources Lazerpig lists, and one of the two he seems to have relied on the most (incidentally, these two are the most critical of all the sources both he and I used). Even so, at pages 205-206, he writes: \"One can add that in 1942, for understandable reasons, this quality was at its lowest level for the entire war. Later it began to steadily increase as a result of the enormous efforts of Soviet designers, technicians, and manufacturers. By the end of the war the newly issued T-34s were able of completing forced marches of 500 km, which was far beyond the capability of majority of their predecessors at the beginning of the war.\"\n\nAnother book that discusses the T-34's reliability, a source Lazerpig lists, and the 2nd of the two he seemed to have relied on the most is *T-34 Mythical Weapon* (2002) by Robert Michulec. Of note is page 161:\n\nIt starts by describing the same thing described in the above books, the first paragraph focusing on the reliability issues in 1942. Then, in the next paragraph, it says that in 1944 the Soviets tried to replaced tank engines with more than 30 hours of operation (no citation is provided, and I haven't found this mentioned anywhere else). It suggests this was done because the \"peacetime guarantee in the first half of 1941\" was 150 hours in theory and 100 hours in practice. The issue with this train of thought is that—on top of getting the peacetime figure wrong—it seems to assume the guaranteed life never improved by 1944. What happened is that \"the overall durability of the V-2 diesel engine fell from the pre-war standard of 300 hours to only about 100 hours in 1942\" (Zaloga 2015, Ch. 5). With the eventual improvement of quality control, however, engine life improved as well, both in terms of warranty and in practice. According to a State Committee of Defense Decree, \"Starting on March 1st, 1945, the following guaranteed service lives are set for tank engines: For 500 hp tank engines, 250 hours instead of the previously established 200 hours.\"^1 In practice, the 2nd Guards Tank Army noted that the \"Expenditure of engine lifespan during the period of crew cohesion training and combat by February 11th, 1945 [for the] T-34, SU-85 [was] 185-190 hours.\"^2 The 6th Guards Tank Army noted an increase to 250-300 hours for their T-34s.^3 This is in line with Zaloga's points on the life span improvements in 1944, and similar to what the Sherman was capable of in 1943 (on average, 235 hours without breakdowns).^4\n\nThen the book claims that \"between the spring of 1942 and summer of 1944, the T-34 tank became almost a one-time-use weapon\", using as an example the 5th Guards Tank Army which, prior to Prokhorovka, lost 15% of its tanks due to mechanical failure. But this is the same example Zaloga used to show reliability improved. In fact, the 85% of tanks that survived the 330-380 km forced march is significantly higher than the percent of tanks that passed inspection at the plants the previous months (as shown in Chart 1 above). This is a good thing. Forczyk agrees: \"While the T-34's armor protection and firepower advantages had largely disappeared by 1943, its superior mobility was dearly demonstrated when 5th Guards Tank Army was able to move its T-34s 300km on their own tracks to the front between July 7-9 and still had about 90% of its tanks operational. No Panther unit could ever have moved this distance without losing most of its tanks to mechanical breakdowns\" (Forczyk 2007, p. 32). Next it describes how in August 1943 the 1st Tank Army lost 50% of its tanks due to malfunction, but then itself notes they \"went into action armed mostly with vehicles that were repaired after being towed off the Kursk battlefield\" and \"the faulty condition of the repaired tanks\".\n\nThe following paragraph \"underlines the superiority of the German equipment, as well as their higher technological level, allowing for repeated repairs and overhauls\" by comparing Soviet total losses with German irrecoverable losses and getting the numbers wrong in the process anyway.\n\nAll in all, Michulec is very pessimistic in his interpretations, and his conclusions in the last paragraph are particularly dubious. It starts by saying: \"Of course, with time, the quality factors of the T-34 started to change for the better, but it is doubtful that the Soviets were able to reach a satisfactory level of production before the end of the war.\" This is followed by a footnote: \"Corroborated by data published in [Unknown] T-34. In 1942, only 7% of the tanks leaving the factory were free of defects. In 1943 this percentage rose to reach 14%, and in 1944 it reached 30%.\" \n\nAt first I found this part confounding. What did \"free of defects\" mean? Then I got my hands on the source it cited and it all made sense: *T-34 Mythical Weapon* here grossly misconstrues the information presented in *Unknown T-34*. The latter specifically notes the percentages refer to \"the first presentation\", which was a part of Soviet acceptance testing: a vehicle would be put through a trial run, any uncovered defects would be fixed, then the vehicle would be put through another trial run, and so on until all defects were corrected. With the exception of the desperate early years, tanks were not accepted into service in the state they left the factory. Furthermore, the numbers mentioned didn't describe ALL T-34s leaving ALL factories, but only Factory 183, detail which Michulec omits entirely. Considering this, the data presented doesn't actually support the conclusion. And given the other things covered so far, I'd argue that the opposite is true. Essentially, this notion that the T-34's \"quality\" didn't reach a \"satisfactory level\" even by 1945 is contradicted by all other sources. But perhaps we're approaching this from the wrong angle. What does \"satisfactory\" even mean? Perhaps Michulec's standards are just very high. However, \"one should not forget that the requirements for quality, reliability, and durability of a combat vehicle are different in peacetime than in wartime. While in peacetime one should be able to count on a long usage period for tanks, in wartime they are essentially expendable materiel. Their quality level can be reduced to an acceptable minimum within the limits of the expected life cycle. However, it is possible to increase their production because of the obtained savings in labor and scarce materials\" (Kavalerchik 2015, pp. 212-213).\n\nTo conclude, considering all of the above, I'd say the build standard of the T-34 improved during the war just as it did after, and reached an acceptable level by the end of the conflict.\n\n********************\n\nReferences:\n\n^1 [RGASPI 644-2-444](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/03/extended-warranty.html)  \n^2 [CAMD RF 307-4148-331 p.33](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2020/04/t-34-85-reliability-1945.html)  \n^3 [CAMD RF 500-12462-93](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2013/06/tank-reliability.html)  \n^4 [CMHQ, Files Block No. 55 - 5774 - 3756](https://heritage.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.lac_reel_c5774/3756)\n\nSources:\n\n* Boris Kavalerchik – The Tanks of Operation Barbarossa: Soviet versus German Armour on the Eastern Front (2018)\n* Steven J.

Many will dismiss this as a source because the Americans had not been properly trained on the maintenance of a T-34, or so they claim. So when the engine collapsed during trials it was often blamed on the fact that the Americans had not correctly oiled the engine filters, forgetting of course that the T-34 supplied to the Americans for testing was one that did not have the later model Cyclone filters. Those were the ones that needed to be oiled.\"\n\nPersonally, I've seen more people who take everything written in it at face value (and think its conclusions are characteristic of all wartime production T-34s) than people who dismiss it entirely. Neither are good approaches. The text needs to be read critically.\n\nFirst of all, the real Aberdeen report hasn't been published in its entirety. What most people have read is actually \"a summary of a conversation\" about it. \"Many accept this document as a brief summary of the results of the testing of the Soviet tanks in America, but this is not so. [...] This is not at all an American report, not even the extracts from it. After all, at the time the ‘Assessment’ appeared, tests had still not been finished\" (Kavalerchik 2015, pp. 189-190).\n\nThe information presented within is not perfect. For example, it states the T-34's armour was bad because it was too soft, when in fact it was bad because it was too hard. Soviet rolled armour of up to 60 mm thickness had a BHN of about 450, almost double that of US armour (240 BHN). This negatively affected its performance against overmatching shells, leading to penetrative hits by 75 mm shells from distances of over 1 km when a more ductile steel plate could have withstood the impact without being perforated (Livingston &amp; Bird 2001, pp. 24-25).\n\nAs for the topic of whether the Americans were trained, instructed, or helped... that's quite a can of worms. Some people point at one engineer Matveev or Matveyev who was allegedly helping the Americans and would have known how to properly operate the vehicle, but I haven't found any primary sources supporting this. The only mention of this chap I found in historical literature was in *Once Again About the T-34*, at page 201:\n\n\"There is the opinion that the Aberdeen testers were not able or did not want to service the air cleaner as suggested, thereby causing the T-34 engine to break down. This, however, in no way corresponds to reality. Engineer Matveev was one of the members of the Soviet delegation in Aberdeen. Among his responsibilities was to teach the Americans how to use the T-34 and KV and how to care for them. The Soviet report about the Aberdeen tests noted that they had never encountered more meticulous and pedantic tank maintenance technicians than the Americans.\"\n\nIt, unfortunately, cites no source. However, even assuming this chap existed, just because his responsibilities were as noted doesn't mean he fulfilled them, and just because the Americans were pedantic and meticulous doesn't mean they accepted Soviet help. According to the Deputy GBTU Chief: \"The American command [refused] help from our engineers working in America at this time, and never requested service instruments for our tanks.\"^1 Ultimately, this topic is polemical. Make of it what you will. I've also heard arguments that the filter was broken and couldn't hold oil anyway... which brings us back to the video.\n\nNo, the Cyclone filters were not the only ones that needed to be oiled. From the Soviet report: \"The T-34 sent to America had an air filter of the 'Pomon' type. This filter was installed on T-34 and BT tanks. If properly cleaned and supplied with oil (in exceptionally dusty environments, this must be done once every 2-3 hours), the Pomon filter guarantees normal engine operation with 79.6% air purity at air dustiness of 1 gram per cubic meter. Starting with 1942, all T-34 tanks have an improved Cyclone filter, which provides 99.4% air purity at air dustiness of 1 gram per cubic meter. This filter also needs cleaning and oiling every 3-4 hours. IS tanks in development will have an improved air filter, providing 100% air purity at air dustiness of 3 grams per cubic meter, and can operate without cleaning for 8 hours. This filter is designated 'Multicyclone'.\"^2 This is probably the biggest problem with this part of the video, and the first factual error I found.\n\nAll in all, the Soviet response did not reject all issues the Americans had raised, as some suggest. Quite the opposite, they admitted many flaws, and noted which of them were in the process of being resolved. The Aberdeen T-34 was, after all, an early model. Like Pulham and Kerrs wrote in *T-34 Shock* (2021), Ch. 10: \"Of course, when mentioning the Aberdeen Assessment, the reader must keep in mind that this is a single T-34 produced at a time when the USSR was suffering from some of its greatest production disruptions and when it had significantly simplified the design and production of the tank to meet wartime needs.\" They quite eloquently add in the epilogue: \"One cannot imagine using the M4A3(75)W Sherman to talk about all Shermans, or the Panzer IV Ausf. D to talk about all Panzer IVs, in just the same way one cannot use the T-34 (UTZ Final Early Turret) to talk about all T-34s. Thus, the single T-34 which was tested at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in 1943 in the USA is not adequate proof of ‘the T-34 being trash’ [...] and instead a much broader overview, considering the sum of all technical and combat evidence, is needed to make any valid assessment of the T-34.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 8:43 \"The Americans also had a soviet engineer, who actually wrote the report, who was with them during the trial and was explaining how to properly handle and maintain the tank. This trial has a lot of misconceptions surrounding it and it's very often disregarded by fans of the t-34 and commieboos alike. We are not going to ignore it.\"\n\nSee above. Given Lazerpig uses the Kavalerchik article as a source I assume he took this part from there. Doesn't explain why he made the claim that the Pomon didn't use oil... the article clearly states it does just a paragraph above the part with Matveev:\n\n\"In the summer it was necessary to clean the gimp with kerosene, oil it, and change 1-1.5 liter of aviation oil in the air cleaner no fewer than every 10 hours of engine operation; in the winter, this had to be done every 20-25 hours (Tank T-34, p. 79).\" This part does has a citation.\n\n**************************\n\nReferences:\n\n^1 [CAMD RF 38-11355-1377](https://www.tankarchives.ca/2014/01/rough-handling-at-aberdeen.html)  \n^2 [CAMD RF 38-11355-1712](https://www.tankarchives.ca/2013/04/aberdeen-t-34-and-kv-1-test.html)\n\nSources:\n\n* Boris Kavalerchik – Once Again About the T-34, The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1 (2015)\n* Robert D.

This is, of course, utter nonsense.\"\n\nEh, yes and no. This is indeed a dubious notion. Nicholas Moran talks a bit about it in a video: both the Germans and the Soviets certainly liked to push this, and it was parroted even after the war (Moran 2020, 4:51).\n\nStill, there is an element of truth here. \"After the fall of France in June 1940, the Red Army had reorganized its tank forces into thirty massive mechanized corps, trying to emulate the successful German Panzer Korps. The reorganization was only partly complete when the Wehrmacht struck. The new mechanized corps were too large and cumbersome in view of the available means of command and control and the poor state of senior army leadership\" (Zaloga 2015, p. 100). \"Each mechanized corps contained two tank divisions and one motorized division [...] most mechanized corps were badly deployed, occupying scattered garrisons with the corps' divisions often up to 100km (60 miles) apart\" (Glantz 2001, p. 24). \"At no point after the first week of the invasion was the Red Army able to mass more than 20–30 KVs in one sector and often only in platoon or company size packets\" (Forczyk 2012, p. 75).\n\nThere's also the issue of tactics. \"There are two reasons why the T-34 did not become a decisive weapon in the summer of 1941. One was the wrong Soviet tank tactics, their practice of using the T-34 in driblets, in conjunction with lighter units or for infantry support, instead of—in line with German thinking—using them in bulk at selected points, tearing surprise gaps into the enemy's front, wrecking his rearward communications, and driving deep into his hinterland. The Russians disregarded this fundamental rule of modern tank warfare, a rule summed up by Guderian in a phrase valid to this day: 'Not driblets but mass'\" (Carell 1965, p. 51). This source has a lot of issues (more on that later), but it gets this part right.\n\nThe Soviets had the bad habit of using their tanks—how Dr. Roman Töppel puts it—piecemeal. As some of the above excerpts also hint, the Soviets tried but failed to imitate the Germans (Töppel 2019, 4:00). Even as late as the Battle of Kursk, they \"had not learned yet how to lead and coordinate [...] and employ such great tank masses\" (ibid. 2:17). These failures play a much larger role in the performance of the Red Army and its tanks in the first half of the war than the shortcomings of the T-34 do.\n\nThere's also this bit from an [interview with Robert Forczyk](https://tankandafvnews.com/2016/06/02/tank-warfare-on-the-eastern-front-an-interview-with-robert-forczyk/): \"The Germans were shocked by the technical superiority of the T-34 and KV-1 in 1941 and if the Red Army had employed them properly (in mass, with trained crews), say at Smolensk, they might have inflicted a real defeat on German Panzer-Divisions. As it was, the KV-1 gave the Germans a few bad scares and probably helped to stop their advance on Leningrad in 1941. Ultimately, the Red Army failed to utilize the advantages of the KV-1 before the Germans instituted a crash program to improve their anti-tank defenses in 1942.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 12:49 \"Russia had just over 2,000 operational T-34s and would produce another 2,300 of them in the opening months of Barbarossa alone.\"\n\nThere are two factual errors here. The USSR had just over 1,000 operational T-34s and would produce another 400-800 of them in the opening months of Barbarossa.\n\nI'm not sure how Lazerpig defines \"opening months\", but the Soviets barely reached his number in 1942, after Barbarossa officially ended. They built 2,100 T-34s between June and December 1941, and that's basically the whole operation.\n\nMore info: A total of [115 T-34s were built in 1940, and 3,016 in 1941](https://i.imgur.com/bjkO7RU.jpg); on 1 June 1941, the Soviets had [891](https://i.imgur.com/6IcdP3C.png), and on 22 June, [1,037](https://i.imgur.com/wJr1QZM.jpg)—well, 1,027, since 10 were in in Transbaikal (Zaloga 2015). This is the [monthly production between June and December 1941](https://i.imgur.com/qkqYzF4.png) (Michulec 2002, p. 158). Between 1 and 21 June 1941 the western military districts received another 138 T-34 tanks (Kavalerchik 2018, Ch. 8).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; 12:58 \"They were used en mass from day one. You see a lot of documentaries and stuff like to portray this idea that as the Germans advanced they beat only these super outdated Russian tanks like the T-26 and the BT series and it was only later that the more advanced models make an appearance to the shock of the German commanders. This is not true, they were fighting KVs and T-34s on literally day one of Operation Barbarossa, en mass.\"\n\nI'm not sure how Lazerpig defines \"en mass\", but the vast majority of Soviet tanks were indeed T-26s and BTs. The Germans did meet T-34s and KV-1s from day one, but those were, as a matter of fact, a minority of the vehicles faced. \"In terms of tank fighting, the new T-34 and KV tanks represented only about a tenth of Soviet tank strength. The vast bulk of the Red Army tank force was made up of older T-26 light tanks and BT cavalry tanks\" (Zaloga 2015, p. 100).\n\nBut maybe he doesn't look at the percent, and instead at absolute numbers. So, how many KVs and T-34s did the Germans fight on day one? I can think of two very early engagements. On 22 June, the 7th Panzer Division engaged the 5th Tank Division of the 8th Mechanized Corps which had 50 T-34s (Moran 2020, 4:51). The 11th Panzer Division encountered four T-34 on the 23rd of June, in the morning, then a few more a bit later during the day (Ganz 2016, Ch. 7). Is that en mass? I don't think so, but YMMV.\n\nAs for the German reaction: \"The new Soviet T-34 and KV tanks came as a nasty surprise to the Wehrmacht, most especially to the infantrymen who were still depending on the old 37mm gun for antitank defense\" (Zaloga 2015, p. 104). \"The Germans began encountering T-34 tanks from the first day of the campaign. They came as a great shock to the German infantry, as their 37mm anti-tank gun projectiles simply bounced off its thick armour...\" (Zaloga 1994, p. 11). \"The Wehrmacht had nothing to compare to the new T-34 or KV which proved a very frightening shock to German infantry and German tanks alike\" (Zaloga 1984, p. 126). \"The appearance of the 34-ton T-34 caused much consternation to the German Panzerwaffe\" (Kershaw 2000, Ch. 7). \"[Stalin's] new KV-1 and KV-2 heavy tanks proved a nasty shock to Hitler's Wehrmacht. Rokossovsky wrote with pride: 'The KV tanks literally stunned the enemy'\" (Tucker-Jones 2021, Ch. 4).\n\nSources:\n\n* Nicholas Moran – 5 Things People Don't Understand About the T-34 (2020)\n* Steven J.

Amazing! What an epiphany the Russians had! Like, take the armor and tilt it slightly. Oh, amazing! Why didn't anyone else think of that?\"\n\nBy whom? Who says this time and time again? I know it's meant to be a humorous exaggeration, but the point being made is that the claim is repeated very often, even today. If this is supposed to be a fact, I'd like to see some evidence to support it. If it's just anecdotal, then I might as well share my own experience on this topic, which is quite different.\n\nI've seen this supposedly widespread misconception about the revolutionary nature of the T-34's slopes laughed at since I first started learning about tanks. It's an argument as old as the first debates I've read on the T-34, with discussions I've personally seen dating back to 2012. Maybe I got lucky—or maybe I just don't interact with anyone ignorant enough on the topic but still sufficiently interested to make this affirmation—however, in all these years, I never heard anyone claim the T-34's sloped armour was revolutionary. I've seen the tank as a whole be called that, but never just the slopes. Yet I kept hearing people denouncing this notion as if it were a myth as common as the Clean Wehrmacht. Obviously, sloped armour wasn't that innovative, and I don't think any half-decent history buff would claim it was, especially in the 2020s. The closest thing to such a statement I found was that the T-34 was the first tank with primarily sloped armour to be produced in large numbers, which is true (Kavalerchik 2015, p. 192)\n\nMaybe it's a generational thing. It's possible it was just said a lot in the 2000s, or earlier, and remained in the consciousness of many people as a common erroneous belief even if it's no longer widespread, and it's still being redundantly combated to this day.\n\nEither way, Lazerpig's argument is a strawman. Even if we assume the slope misconception is widespread, his gross exaggerations are textbook strawman fallacy. And he exaggerates a lot:\n\n&gt; 31:15 \"A lot of people will look at the T-34 as the epitome of the sloped armor design and laugh at the other Allied tanks for not knowing that sloped armor makes Nazi shells bursts off your tank like it was gliding through the fucking matrix.\"\n\nI'm really curious what people he normally interacts with, or if he's just poisoning the well. Wait, what's that about other Allied tanks?\n\n&gt; 32:11 \"Now, for those of you with an IQ above that of a garden salad, you may have asked the question why didn't the Allies design tanks with sloped armor?\"\n\nThey did. He even lists the Sherman later. And a ton of other Allied tanks had it too. The British weren't the only Allied nation designing tanks. Other than the M4, the US also used sloped armour on the M3A1, M5, M5A1, M22, M24, M3 Medium, M26, and that's not counting other AFVs like the M10, M18, M36, or M8. The vast majority of US tanks featured sloped armour; over 85% according to [my calculations](https://i.imgur.com/h4DfpGU.png). And even British designs incorporated sloping to various extents.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo conclude, whether you agree with the use of strawmanning for the sake of humour or not, the point remains that his exaggerations poison the well just as much as they make the audience laugh. He paints defenders of the T-34 as idiots, propagandists, or both—and this is not the only time he does it in his video.\n\nSources:\n\n* Boris Kavalerchik – Once Again About the T-34, The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Volume 28, Issue 1 (2015)\n\n# CHA vs RHA and other amazing claims\n\n&gt; 16:15 \"Casting! Casting something from a large single piece as opposed to welding lots of plates together^1 gives you a huge advantage in armour protection without necessarily having to increase thickness and add a shitload of weight^2 hence why the Matilda II with its 60 millimetres^3 of cast armour was shrugging off rounds from an 88 millimetre like they were made of fucking paper^4 but a Cromwell with 80 millimetres^5 of flat plate armour, typically thicker armour, can't do that.\"^6\n\nThis is one of the worst parts of the video. It's completely riddled with factual errors. Here are some initial notes:\n\n^1 The alternative to casting is welding (or otherwise connecting) rolled homogeneous or face hardened plates together, both of which offer superior protection compared to cast armour.\n\n^2 No it doesn't, it's the exact opposite, citations will follow.\n\n^3 Sic. The Matilda I had 60mm, and it wasn't cast. The Matilda II had 78mm, and it was cast.\n\n^4 Citation needed.\n\n^5 The Cromwell had 64mm of RHA on the hull, 76mm on the turret. There were SOME Cromwells with 100mm on the hull, but these were rare.\n\n^6 The 88 could shred both with ease.\n\nSo, to reiterate, setting aside the comparison of CHA and RHA, this entire paragraph is still filled with mistakes. He gets the armour thicknesses wrong, both of them. Even ignoring the exact numbers in millimetres, he gets which is thicker wrong. And even ignoring that, even assuming he was thinking of the 100mm driver plate Cromwell, he gets the penetrations wrong. No variant of the Matilda could shrug off 88mm rounds like that.\n\nAs for CHA vs RHA, it seems I wasn't the only one to take issue. In his Tiger video, Lazerpig says:\n\n&gt; 21:13 \"I actually love how everyone was spewing all over the comments about how I don't know that pressed and rolled steel is better than cast and then someone asked the Chieftain to confirm it and he basically agreed with me. I'll reiterate: shut up! Historians know better than you.\"\n\nHe refers to Nicholas Moran, but since he does not directly quote what the Chieftain said, it is probably out of context. Still, I agree with him on one thing, historians do know better, which is why I have compiled a collection of quotes on the topic from 7 separate books [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TankPorn/comments/yvsmcr/cast_versus_rolled_homogenous_armor_and_claims/iwfyibp/?context=3).\n\nOf course, cast armour is not inferior to RHA in *every* aspect. It has a number of advantages in cost, ease of production, and shapeability. 5 of the 7 books I quoted above mention this, one mention is already included in the quote above, the other four are:\n\n* \"The advantage of cast armor is that it can be molded into almost any shape, furnishing curved surfaces of any desired thickness. [...] In general, rolled armor is about 15% better in resistance to shock and penetration than cast armor. However, this advantage is offset to some extent by the varying angles of obliquity and irregular shapes possible in castings. These variations in shape considerably decrease the penetrating ability of certain types of projectiles.\" (U.S. Army Materiel Command 1963, pp. 10-1, 10-3)\n* \"The biggest advantage of CHA was that it can be molded into almost any shape, furnishing curved surfaces of any desired thickness, hence its use in making gun shields and cupolas on the Panther tank.\" (Green &amp; Green 2012, pp. 132-133)\n* \"This negative is partly offset by the rounded surfaces that mark CHA, which increase the chances of incoming projectiles glancing off.\" (Green 2021, p. 53)\n* \"However, the casting process permitted the use of a smooth streamlined shape providing approximately the same protection for the equivalent weight.\" (Hunnicutt 1978, p. 67)\n\nI'm fairly certain that the missing context from the Chieftain's 'confirmation' relates to the above.\n\nAnyway, I hope this clarifies beyond any doubt, regardless of how you interpreted Lazerpig's statement, what exactly are the advantages and disadvantages of CHA vs RHA.\n\nSources:\n\n* U.S. Army Materiel Command, AMCP 706-107, Engineering Design Handbook - Elements of Armament Engineering, Part Two - Ballistics (1963)\n* Michael Green, James D.

        "text": "Greetings r/badhistory. Long time since I’ve posted here, I know, I know. Disclaimers first and foremost: One, no this isn’t ‘denying crimes of the Soviet regime’. Stalin was a paranoid asshole, Lenin created a rotten system and Beria was a serial rapist. Two, the work I’m discussing is American, but I’ve transcribed material and may have, in places, used the correct spellings for my region. I’m Dyslexic, bite me. I’m not going to go back and take us out. Third: I’m a medievalist so this is all a bit out of my wheelbarrow, so do feel free to correct me if you feel that I’ve massively lost the plot when it comes to refuting the badhistory. Also, I've had to resubmit this, because Reddit gets a bit nuts about russian links. Ah well.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, I was in the library today to pick up some Byzantine material I’d ordered, when I ended up browsing the shelves and picking up another book too. David Satter’s ‘It was a Long Time Ago and It Never Happened Anyway: Russia and the Communist Past’. It’s a 2012 book that talks about how the memory of Soviet era is processed in Russia, the reality vs popular narratives, the disinterest in acknowledging crimes against humanity that occurred, and how the history Soviet state has been warped by popular memory into a ‘The good old days when Russia was strong’. Some of the worries expressed about this has been rather interesting, given what it’s lead to in recent months. The line that ‘In place of national memory, a new national myth has replaced the myths of Communism. It says “We are a country with a great past. There were bad things in our history. No one justifies terror and repression. But we were great in the past and we will be great in the future.” Talk of terror interferes with the return of historical pride’ feels to have been validated rather well by recent events, but I’ll speak no more of that for the risk of breaching rule 5. ^1\n\n\nAnyway, most of the book is about David Satter’s travels through Russia, nationalisation of the Soviet past, looking at how Stalin and co have been rehabilitated in Russia, and how even those that had opposed the Soviet system, like Alexander Solzhenitsyn, have been converted into followers of the post Soviet Russian regime, despite the latter also being totalitarian in nature. ^2\n\nThe book ends with a conclusion that argues that ‘the failure to acknowledge and atone for the mass crimes of Communism has been contributed to a situation where the average Russian is powerless before the apparatus of the state as was a citizen of the Soviet union’ and that ‘Russia differs from the West in its attitude toward the individual. In the West, the individual is treated as an end in himself. His life cannot be disposed of recklessly in the pursuance of political schemes, the recognition of its value imposes limits on the behavior of its authorities. In Russia, the individual is seen by the state as a means to an end, and genuine moral framework for political life does not exist’. ^3\n\n\nThe book has issues. The way it describes Russians as an almost collectivist hivemind that have no agency under the state is…troubling, I must say, and I feel it could have been worded better. The repeated insistence on ‘Communism is totalitarianism’ is disappointing, given how reductionist that statement is when there are many difference branches and he’s just on about Marxist Leninism, but it’s somewhat to be expected. Some of the title chapters are rather misleading, especially five and nine, ‘The Appeal of Communism’ and ‘The Roots of the Communist Idea’, neither of which actually have anything to do with the contents of the chapters. The former chapter is just a collection of his interviews with people talking about ‘the good old days’, and how people were happy because communism ‘filled a basic spiritual need’, ‘appealed to the chauvinism of the ordinary man, who compensated for his personal impotence by identifying with the power state’ and gave sense of ‘stability’. ^4\n\nIt goes on to basically argue that the West ‘tried to win over the peoples of the East with the help of Facts […] this reasoning, however, usually had little effect’ and ‘the fall of Communism left a gap in the psychology of Russians’. ^5\n\nChapter nine, despite its title, just focuses on first outlining that Alexander Solzhenitsyn wasn’t a fighter against political repression, just a fighter against political repression of Russian nationalists, and stresses that he’s an imperialist that tried to absolve ethnic Russians of guilt for crimes against humanity that occurred under the Soviet state. ^6  It then goes on to discuss the Russia state’s view of itself as having a special, God given role as the third Rome, how voices in the Russian government try to blame everything the Soviets did on Jews and how Russia as a nation state developed in a way that was intertwined with the authority of the god invested ruler. ^7  It then argues that Russians accepted communism because the Russian national character was conditioned to accept totalitarianism. ^8  There’s nothing about what the actual reasons for revolution in Russia for, outside of some weird orientalist ideas about how Russia isn’t really European and is thus attracted to totalitarian regimes.\n\n\nIt's the type of book I’d have expected to have come out in the early 2000s, not 2012, basically.\nAnyway, this is just the set up. The actual bad history, since this is a r/badhistory post, not a ‘hi Wil come do a book review for us’?\n\n\n&gt; ‘During the period 1929 to 1953, eighteen million persons passed through the Soviet labour camp system. The artificial famine of 1932-33 took seven million lives. Nearly a million persons were shot during the Great Terror of 1937-38. In all, the number of persons who died in peace time as a result of the Communist authorities is estimated at twenty million. If one considers the demographic impact on three generations (1917-53), it can be estimated that the total population loss -those killed and those who were never born- comes to 100 million persons’.  ^ 9\n\n\nNow, first and foremost, I have to say that it is extremely dishonest to include ‘those who were never born’ when discussing people killed. You can’t kill people who never existed. You don’t even know if said person would have been born anyway, it’s based on assumptions of growth without taking into account other factors, such as economic stability, food production, education and standing of living of the population, how widespread sexual education and contraceptive is, abortion laws and healthcare.\nIt's also an issue because the idea of ‘100 million dead due to the Soviets, if we include people not born’ comes from Ivan Kurganov, a literal nazi collaborator, who later moved to the US, gave a 66 million figure of estimated deaths , then upgraded it to 110 million based on what he thought the demographic should have been. ^10  This number got popularised by it later being used by Solzhenitsyn in a 1976 interview when he urged Spanish Liberals to calm down, and claimed they didn't really know what Dictatorship was. ^11  Satter tries to weasel it by not directly saying ‘100 million killed’ but it’s heavily implied with the way he frames it.\n\n\nSatter also doesn’t actually provide a source for his numbers. In the footnote [or endnote, it’s one of those weird books that put all the footnotes at the back of the book for some unholy reason] is\n\n&gt;  ‘The scale of murder in the Soviet Union was so immense that estimating the number of victims with any degree of accuracy is difficult if not impossible. Figures cited in recently available archival materials are often in conflict with demographic data which places the death tolls considerably higher. In this book I accept 20 million as the number of direct victims of the Soviet regime.’  ^12 \n\n\nHe doesn’t actually tell us where he’s getting that number from, mind you, just that it includes:\n\n\n&gt; ‘200,000 victims of the Red Terror; 11 million victims of famine and dekulakization in the 1930s; 700,000 persons who were executed during the Great Terror; 400,000 additional execution victims between 1929 -1953; 1.6 million persons who died in forced population transfers; and a minimum of 2.7 persons who died in Gulag camps. To the resulting figure of 16.6 million should be added persons who died in prisons, 975,000 Gulag prisoners released during the war to punitive battalions, where they faced certain death, the victims of partisan warfare in Ukraine and the Baltic republics after the war, and Gulag prisoners freed so that their deaths would not count towards the mortality totals for the labour camps.’  ^13\n\n\nSatter, how are we meant to eat your pasta without any sauce? \n\n\nI understand that it’s hard to give exact numbers but it’s very weird to go ‘I can’t give exact numbers or sources’, then list numbers, ya know? Anyway, from looking into myself: Stephen Kotkin has 30,000 heads of households executed, with five million dekulakiszed [arrested and sent to labour camps] or fleeing in rural areas during the early 30s. ^14  Adding to this is 5 to 7 million that died in the famines, 1.2 to 1.4 million in Kazakhstan [out of a population of 6.5 million] and 3.5 million in Ukraine [out of a population of 33 million ] and the remainder coming from across the union. ^15 This is then coupled with 830,000, dead in the  terror of 37-38, combined with previous years to give a million in the terror, though obviously these figures only include those killed up to 1941. ^16  Timothy Snyder meanwhile puts deaths in the Gulags at 2-3 million, a 5 million dead in the famines and around a million for the Great Terror and other executions. ^17  For reference, that’s roughly 6 to 8 million from Kotkin up to ’41, not including Gulag deaths, and 8-9 million in total from Snyder. Nicolas Werth has 1.5 million dead in the Gulag, 770,000 in political executions including those of the Great Terror and 6 million in the famine, though this work is from 1999. ^18  Stephen Wheatcroft, writing back in 1996, argues for 1 million dead from executions, and up to 3 million dead from the gulag system, yet doesn’t include the famines because he had ‘come across no evidence to support the charge that they were part of a purposive killing policy’. ^19\n\n\nRegardless of which you prefer, the modern estimates aren’t following the 20 million dead. And sure was hell aren’t 100 million. Now, it might be that the popular numbers were different back when Satter wrote his book. But between how he refuses to give any sources on his numbers, includes people in Penal regiments who were killed by the Germans, and tries to include people who were never born in his condemnation, it does not paint a good picture. That and the fact that Nicolas Werth’s work came out in 1999, and Synder’s in 2010, whereas Satter didn’t get his out till 2012, so it’s not like he didn’t have the chance to read the newer material! If he prefers the older figures, he could have least given a cite about where he’s taking them from…\n\n\nThe Soviet crimes were, of course, horrific. Smaller numbers do not mean it was any less terrible, and it’s a lesson to us all on what unchecked power and hierarchical systems can lead to without proper checks and balances that aim to protect the individual. Given that he spends most of the intro comparing and contrasting the Russian reaction to Soviet crimes, to the German reaction to the genocide done by the Nazis, it seems to me that he picked the larger number as a hook. ^20  Bait it with ‘even more dead than under the Nazis, yet no memorials’, and then provide his own answer through interviews and analysis [the answer being ‘Russians have a national culture of loving totalitarians and stability over human rights they’re not really Europeans’].\n\n\nIt's weird to me, personally, since the number of millions dead shouldn’t really matter when it comes to the question of ‘should they be remembered, and should there be a monument to them’. Yes, there should be. Be it 9 million, or 20 million. Victims should be remembered. We don’t need to use them for political attack points or make weird takes about the ‘Freedom loving Democratic capitalist West vs Oriental totalitarian collectivists’.\n\n\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1 - David Satter, *It Was a Long Time Ago, and It Never Happened Anyway: Russia and the Communist Past* (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012), pp. 6-7.\n\n2 - Satter, *It was a Long Time Ago*, p. 167.\n\n3 - Satter, *It was a Long Time Ago*, pp. 300, 304-5.\n\n4 - Satter, *It was a Long Time Ago*, pp. 95-111.\n\n5 - Satter, *It was a Long Time Ago*, pp. 109-10.\n\n6 - Satter, *It was a Long Time Ago*, pp. 167-73.\n\n7 - Satter, *It was a Long Time Ago*, pp. 173-83.\n\n8 - Satter, *It was a Long Time Ago*, pp. 183-7.\n\n9 - Satter, *It was a Long Time Ago*, p. 2.\n\n10 - Андрей Сидорчик, ‘Дело Профессора Курганова.

        "text": "[INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9gw98x/historical_inaccuracies_in_the_assassins_creed/): Entries on All Main Console Games of Assassin's Creed.\n\nAfter finishing historical analyses of all the main games of the AC games up to ORIGINS and Odyssey, next on the list was Valhalla. However, I took a long time to get to play it and process it, mostly Covid but also Life. Luckily, Ubisoft took a similarly long break between this game and its next title \"Assassin's Creed Mirage\".\n\nThis Post was extremely long so I had to divide it into two parts. Will present links to second part soon.\n\n**TITLE:** ***ASSASSIN'S CREED VALHALLA***\n\n**SETTING:** Viking Age England, Norway (and Others).\n\n**TIME**: *Year(s) 872-878 CE*\n\n**Valhalla can be understood as the third of a \"pagan\" trilogy** that began with ORIGINS, an attempt to take a series whose motifs originated with the Crusades and resituate it in an antique Pre-Christian era. Origins and Odyssey were effectively Pre-Christian while Valhalla dealing with the last major European pagan civilization (the Vikings) is effectively the bridging game. I am going to focus on MAIN CAMPAIGNS, and the Regional Arcs, and some others. This will NOT BE COMPREHENSIVE as an overview of the full game. I am also Avoiding DLC as is standard for *my series*, with the exception of \"The Last Chapter\" epilogue cutscenes and 'Discovery Tour: Viking Age'.\n\n**CONFLATION OF NOMENCLATURE, PLACES AND CULTURES**\n\nThe biggest problem with the Viking era is that the period is filled with **conflation** in both history and cultural practice. This is a problem that AC Valhalla inherited from its sources, and from earlier popular culture representations.\n\n* Throughout the game, Eivor distinguishes herself and her brother Sigurd as \"Norse\" compared to Danes and English. Norse refers to people originating in what we call Norway. We call it \"Norse Mythology\" even if the sources of the Norse Myth that survived come from Iceland. At the same time, the majority of settlers and invader in England and Frankia were Danes, while Norwegians like Eivor, Sigurd and the Raven Clan were far more likely to settle in Ireland and Scotland **(Haywood 109)**. So it's a bit displaced geographically, and it's a bit odd why they didn't make the characters Danes?\n* One of the major sources of first-hand interactions with Vikings is Ahmad ibn Fadlan's account of his interaction with raiders from the Volga River who he calls \"Rus\" and described them as blonde figures with peak physiques tattooed from head to toe **(Haywood 183-184)**. It's (largely) from Fadlan we get the image in pop culture of Vikings wearing tattoos, which is a whole thing in the game but in fact that was a practice by Eastern Rus settlers not Northmen in England (who were largely peaceful and became extremely loyal mercenaries for the Eastern Roman Empire). The Anglo-Saxon accounts denounced Vikings for being primly dressed proto-dandys who wore rich garments, combed their hair and effortlessly seduced English women with their manners, looks, and affectations for grooming **\\[1\\].** Among the \"grave goods\" of the Vikings were intricately detailed combs and other artifacts. In AC Valhalla we have a Biker Gang version of Vikings, quite at odds with the assimilationist dandies of the actual Northmen Settlers in England.\n* In terms of gameplay map, the England we see in this game is full of regional names like \"Sciropscire\" and so on, but the concept of dividing British regions by shires actually derives from reforms made by Aelfred of Wessex a bit after the timeline of the game **(Keynes 232).** The shire system of English administrative division originated in Wessex in the mid 800s CE and was never exported outside the region until *after* Edington (Late 878 CE) and beyond **(Morris 185).** I suppose the British Shire system proved useful for the game's map builders but it's a case of conflation all the same.\n\n**MAIN CAMPAIGN**\n\nAssassin's Creed **Valhalla doesn't really have a linear campaign**. It has a quest structure which you can complete in mostly any order, one that ends when you reach Level 280 in the game's XP status. This unlocks the questline that brings about the final missions that ends the story of Eivor, Basim and Sigurd, the three focal characters of the narrative. To reach Level 280 one has to complete all the quests in the full map save for \"Hamtunscire\" in the South. **Upon finishing the game's main story, you have to complete two more side-quests** (\"The Order of the Ancients\", \"The Alliance Map\") to effectively conclude the main historical segment of this game.\n\n* **Most of the historical figures are minor figures such as Oswald, King of East Anglia**. All we know of King Oswald was that there are coins minted in his name from the period, and he's believed to have been a puppet King of the Vikings. So there's literally nothing to be said for or against his representation here. The first villain of the game is Kjotve the Cruel who in history was known as Kjotve the Rich who was one of the many petty kings defeated by the legendary Harald Fairhair. The **\"Discovery Tour: Viking Age\"** points out the lack of historicity about Fairhair.\n* In England, a lot of the regional missions follow a pattern: Eivor wanders into a region, intervenes on questions of who should be Ealdorman or King or whatnot, and in exchange gets a promise of an alliance to her \"Raven Clan\". This is roughly accurate to the current understanding of Viking conquests during the Great Heathen Army's invasion. The Vikings allied with local thegns, ealdormen, and Kings, and established their own client kings\\*\\*(Morris 212-214).\\*\\*\n* Among the game's most interesting characters is Ivarr the Boneless, one of the famous sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, who like many Vikings is more legendary than true. Ivarr the Boneless is there to embody the \"Bad Viking\" but he's also a compelling villain who's entertaining to watch, that the story as it is kind of dries up after he dies midway into the \"Alliance\" sequences. He appears as an agent propping up King Ceolwulf of Mercia. In the game Ceolwulf is a Saxon king and ally of the Vikings, whose son Ceolbert becomes part of a cruel plot by Ivarr in his rivalry with King Rhodri. King Rhodri is an actual historical figure and he did in fact win notable victories against the Vikings as presented here. That said there's no record of any rivalry with Ivarr, and Rhodri's death and defeat came in a battle against Saxon kings (who he opposed as much as he did the Vikings). Here he's presented as a personal enemy who's brutally murdered by Ivarr and submitted to the famous blood eagle.\n* The blood eagle is an act of ritual killing that has *zero* historical evidence. It's only attested in Norse sagas, but not in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle **(Morris, 197).** The most famous legend is when King Aella of Northumbria was submitted to it by Ragnar's sons in revenge but the Chronicle records him dying in battle. Most historians doubt this because it's only mentioned in Sagas composed orally centuries later.\n* Other historical figures are tucked away in the corner. **Ganger Hrolf/Rollo the Walker** appears in the Essexe region story arc in a minor role as a 17 year old. There's little record of Rollo the Walker's life before 885 CE **(Haywood 97-98).** He's shown as a lithe young man when historically, Hrolf/Rollo was so huge he couldn't ride a horse, leading to his suffix of \"the Walker\".\n* **Supposedly Ljuvina Bjarmasdottir and her husband Hjorr is a real historical figure.** But I've not been to locate any historical sources verifying this. Academic searches lead to dead ends. The one website attesting this claims it gets the information from author Bergsveinn Birgisson who researching his family history came across this material and used it for his novel \"The Black Viking\". I'm chalking right now to a \"maybe **\\[2\\]**\n* **As Mary Beard argued recently, racial diversity has a long history in Britain\\[3\\].** The Viking invasions saw England reacquainted with global trade so in terms of verisimilitude I accept the presence of the various diverse characters here. Archeological evidence from Torskey reveals Arab Dirhem coins **(Haywood 53).** Likewise remains from the Jorvik Coppergate ruins have found artefacts from across the world **(Haywood 70).**\n* King Halfdan Ragnarsson was, per legend, the youngest son of the Ragnarssons and also the most solidly historical. In the game he appears much older for some reason but he was youngest, originally. Within the game, we see him take over as first fully Viking King of Jorvik. Ricsige, the last Saxon King of York, apparently \"died of grief\" historically whereas here he's killed as a traitor **(Morris 214).** A major plotline in the Eurvicscire story is **\"lead poisoning\"** and the game repeats the story of lead poisoning causing the decline and fall of the Roman Empire **\\[4\\].**\n* The **War with the Picts** is a bit unbelievable to me. We see Picts as woad-wearing barbarians from the Roman past, but at this time they would have been mostly Christianized and not very different culturally speaking from the other characters we see here. The Picts were also brutally suppressed during the Viking Age, and essentially subject to ethnic cleansing and cultural erasure in this time, so I think presenting them as essentially Orcs, albeit with a Glaswegian accent, is unfair **(Haywood 120-122)**.\n* The regional arcs Gloucestrescire which shows a Wicker Man sacrifice is totally fictional, as are most of the regional arcs in places like Suth-Sexe and Cent and so on. The most important historical figure we see in the game is of course King Aelfred of Wessex, he threads through multiple layers across the game, including Two Epilogue Sections. In the \"Hamtunscire\" Alliance Map, that happens after the main (fictional) story ends, we see Aelfred confront Guthrum at the Battle of Cippenham, which led to Aelfred's defeat and fugitive retreat but which the game presents as a Pyrrhic Victory for the Northmen. This is of course a harbinger of the Battle of Edington whose aftermath we see in **\"Discovery Tour: Viking Age\"** and the Epilogue Last Chapter missions. The account of the Battle of Cippenham we see, including the attack on a Christian holiday, is broadly fair as well as it coming from a break in a treaty. The character of Guthrum, who we see briefly here, is shown as older when he was in fact in his 40s.\n\n**MONASTERY MASHING**\n\nThe **most provocative gameplay loop in AC Valhalla** **is** the fact that your player characters is encouraged **to go raiding on a series of monasteries** dotted across the map.\n\n* Obviously the fact that your protagonist Eivor goes a raiding and attacks these monasteries and somehow, implausibly, doesn't kill civilians is a total fantasy. It's true that Vikings weren't serial killers 24/7 and did combine raiding and trading, but on raid they did conduct acts of violence. In one occassion, the 806 raid on the monastery of Iona, they killed 68 civilians **(Morris 181).**\n* At the same time, I wish Valhalla had leaned a bit into the **\"monastery discourse\"** a small controversy that first raised its head when A. T. Lucas first put forth his evidence that before and after the Viking Raids, a good majority of monasteries in Ireland were raided by native Irish Catholics **\\[5\\].** This thesis was groundbreaking and controversial in its time for arguing that monastery raids were not exclusive to Vikings but also involved Christian and Catholic figures. Now of course like all bold claims, it gathered pushbacks, qualifications, and emendations over time, but Lucas' main claim has endured and historians agree that the period before and after did have: *Christian on Christian violence*. Coupland's more recent article, published in 2014 has established similar acts of violence by Catholics in Frankia contemporaneous to the Viking Invasions of France.\n\n&gt;In terms of the looting of churches, we have seen that there was little difference between the Franks and the invading Scandinavians when it came to the sacredness and inviolability of church property. Ecclesiastical treasures were stolen by kings bent on harming their rivals, by nobles intent on lining their pockets, and by opportunist thieves seeking to make a quick profit, as well as by Vikings who had come to Francia for the primary purpose of acquiring booty.**Simon Coupland, Page 95**\n\n* In essence, the principal reason why the Vikings Raids caused so much outrage was that it was done by pagans against Christians, and strong and resourceful pagans at that. Violence at the hands of fellow Christians, or directed by fellow Christians, was a bit different and could easily be justified. Even King Aelfred of Wessex, presented in this game as a virtuous Christian ruler, and remembered as such in Anglo-Saxon chronicles, was condemned by the monks of Abingdon as a \"Judas\" who despoiled their lands, taking land and revenue from the monasteries for royal uses **(Morris 206).**\n* The reason monasteries were targets for attack was that wealth was stored in these buildings. In addition, many monasteries in England were so-called 'fake monasteries' condemned by the Venerable Bede as a way for the impious (in his eyes) to use the monastery as an excuse to claim privileges that were otherwise exclusive to the Church **(Morris 143).** In AC Valhalla, we don't get mention of Christian rulers doing the same in past. Likewise, the Vikings themselves seem to on occassion, offer anti-Christian reasons for the raiding but there's no reason to think that the Vikings were motivated by religious hostility. After all many Vikings after converting to Christianity, continued raiding churches. In gameplay terms, each monastery raid has \"resources\" stored in these large ornate looking golden chests, and we need these resources to upgrade Ravensthorpe and get the Feast Buff or whatever. But the actual wealth stolen by the Vikings from monastery raids was relics, liturgical books, decorations, and slaves.\n\n&gt;\"Saints’ relics were frequently housed in shrines embellished with precious metals and jewels, reflecting their spiritual value and encouraging devotion among the faithful...a list of the many relics remaining at St. Bavo in Ghent after the Vikings had been and gone included a spine from Christ’s crown of thorns which had supposedly been set in gold and precious stones by St. Eligius himself.\"**Simon Coupland**, **Page 80.**\n\nIn the game whenever we go inside the monastery interiors during Abbey raids, we hardly ever see the bling on offer, being scuttled by the Vikings. The wealth stolen by the Vikings were often sold to local and international markets and, in Coupland's view, often melted down by the Vikings to create jewelry, such as the silver arm-rings we often see characters in the game exchange during weddings and other ceremonies **(Coupland 90-91)**.\n\n**SLAVERY**\n\nThe big elephant in the room with AC Valhalla is of course **the question of slavery**.Quite a few commentators have accused Valhalla of whitewashing the role of Vikings in the slave trade. That's true **but it's not just the Vikings who are whitewashed**.\n\n* In the early mission where you settle Ravensthorpe, called \"The Raven and the Cuckoo\" after solving an issue caused by Saxon prisoners, Eivor remarks that perhaps they can \"trade him for a pig\". We see a more direct representation of slavery in the **\"Discovery Tour: Viking Age\"** story missions focusing on Thorstein, a sympathetic Norse tradesman who owns a thrall, treats him well, who attains manumission and then enters into willing partnership with Thorstein, his former master. **What the game misses though is acknowledging the existence of slavery in Christian Anglo-Saxon society,** the period of history where Catholics enslaved fellow Catholics, sold them to fellow Catholics, and kept them in bondage. Within the game, the few mentions of slavery are exclusively seen in Viking society when in fact slavery was rife across Europe and the Catholic Church was deeply embedded in the institution.\n* The most famous anecdote about the Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England, involves Pope Gregory the Great going to a slave market and seeing some English boys on the market and remarking, according to Venerable Bede, \"non Angli, sed Angeli\" **(Morris 58).** Not Angles, but Angels. What Pope Gregory did not do was free the slave boys, instead he purchased them and later dispatched and supported efforts to spread Christianity among Anglo-Saxon England **(Serfass 87-88).** Pope Gregory the Great, like many Popes of his era, before and after, was a slaveowner **(Serfass 77).**\n* Slavery existed in Anglo-Saxon England, *before* the Viking Age and *after* Christianization of the Saxons. a fact not acknowledged in this game. During the reign of the Mercian King Offa, London was already an international slave market, well before the Viking invasions **(Morris 138)**. Aelfred of Wessex *was* in fact an impressive ruler for his time and place, but the game ignores the fact that **Alfred's Wessex was a slave society.**\n\n&gt;\"An even more basic division was between freedom and servitude. Alfred's Wessex was a slave society. No one can even begin to estimate how many slaves (or free men, for that matter) there was in ninth-century Wessex, but from Alfred's laws it is clear that even ceorls owned slaves.**\"Richard Abels. PAGE 36**\n\n* Slavery of course increased tenfold during the Viking Age, as a result of Viking activity. Emphasizing the existence and continuity of slavery in Anglo-Saxon England is not the same as downplaying the Viking contribution in heightening it. It's absolutely true that Vikings targeted slaves in Ireland, England, France and elsewhere and that Dublin was the biggest slave market in Europe during this time. Whether slavery was an inherent part of Viking religion has no real evidence. After all, Vikings after Christianization continued being a slaveowning and slave-trading society, in the same way Imperial Rome, Byzantine Empire and likewise the Anglo-Saxons continued slavery. In general, the only significant exception was the Franks who did look down against enslaving fellow Franks (albeit not non-Franks) **(Coupland 80).**\n* **In general for the common person, there would not have been a great deal of difference between Viking England and Anglo-Saxon England**. As noted by Patricia Dutchak, the Bishop Wulfstan, Archbishop of York, in 1014 CE, advocated for a stratified society where everybody knew their place and, \"He was deeply shocked that runaway slaves had not only been accepted into the Danish army, but achieved a greater social status and received more honour than their former masters\" **(Dutchak 36).**\n\nThe \"slavery\" discourse of AC Valhalla has led to some telling responses. This article by Brett Deveraux, shows up in a variety of places online **\\[6\\].** Deveraux takes issue with the game's presentation of the Norse as protagonists while downplaying and sanitizing their actions. The article talks of the \"Norse practice of slavery\" and claiming that Christians militated \"against the Norse practice of slavery\" while ignoring the existence and flourishing of slavery in Anglo-Saxon Christian communities and across Christian Europe. Looking at the game carefully, AC Valhalla does ultimately validate this \"clash of civilizations\" contrast more than Deveraux credits, but the existence of this ahistorical assumption and not overturning it is the problem here and AC Valhalla I guess ought to be credited for at least challenging this assumption somewhat.\n\nEND OF PART 1(LINK FOR PART 2 WILL APPEAR HERE)\n\n**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WORKS CITED**\n\n**TEXTS**\n\n* ABELS, Richard.

        "text": " [INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9gw98x/historical_inaccuracies_in_the_assassins_creed/): Entries on All Main Console Games of Assassin's Creed.\n\nAfter finishing historical analyses of all the main games of the AC games up to ORIGINS and Odyssey, next on the list was Valhalla. However, I took a long time to get to play it and process it, mostly Covid but also Life. Luckily, Ubisoft took a similarly long break between this game and its next title \"Assassin's Creed Mirage\".\n\nThis Post was extremely long so I had to divide it into two parts. Will present links to second part soon.\n\n**TITLE:** ***ASSASSIN'S CREED VALHALLA***\n\n**SETTING:** Viking Age England, Norway (and Others).\n\n**TIME**: *Year(s) 872-878 CE*\n\n**Valhalla can be understood as the third of a \"pagan\" trilogy** that began with ORIGINS, an attempt to take a series whose motifs originated with the Crusades and resituate it in an antique Pre-Christian era. Origins and Odyssey were effectively Pre-Christian while Valhalla dealing with the last major European pagan civilization (the Vikings) is effectively the bridging game. I am going to focus on MAIN CAMPAIGNS, and the Regional Arcs, and some others. This will NOT BE COMPREHENSIVE as an overview of the full game. I am also Avoiding DLC as is standard for *my series*, with the exception of \"The Last Chapter\" epilogue cutscenes and 'Discovery Tour: Viking Age'.\n\n**CONFLATION OF NOMENCLATURE, PLACES AND CULTURES**\n\nThe biggest problem with the Viking era is that the period is filled with **conflation** in both history and cultural practice. This is a problem that AC Valhalla inherited from its sources, and from earlier popular culture representations.\n\n* Throughout the game, Eivor distinguishes herself and her brother Sigurd as \"Norse\" compared to Danes and English. Norse refers to people originating in what we call Norway. We call it \"Norse Mythology\" even if the sources of the Norse Myth that survived come from Iceland. At the same time, the majority of settlers and invader in England and Frankia were Danes, while Norwegians like Eivor, Sigurd and the Raven Clan were far more likely to settle in Ireland and Scotland **(Haywood 109)**. So it's a bit displaced geographically, and it's a bit odd why they didn't make the characters Danes?\n* One of the major sources of first-hand interactions with Vikings is Ahmad ibn Fadlan's account of his interaction with raiders from the Volga River who he calls \"Rus\" and described them as blonde figures with peak physiques tattooed from head to toe **(Haywood 183-184)**. It's (largely) from Fadlan we get the image in pop culture of Vikings wearing tattoos, which is a whole thing in the game but in fact that was a practice by Eastern Rus settlers not Northmen in England (who were largely peaceful and became extremely loyal mercenaries for the Eastern Roman Empire). The Anglo-Saxon accounts denounced Vikings for being primly dressed proto-dandys who wore rich garments, combed their hair and effortlessly seduced English women with their manners, looks, and affectations for grooming **\\[1\\].** Among the \"grave goods\" of the Vikings were intricately detailed combs and other artifacts. In AC Valhalla we have a Biker Gang version of Vikings, quite at odds with the assimilationist dandies of the actual Northmen Settlers in England.\n* In terms of gameplay map, the England we see in this game is full of regional names like \"Sciropscire\" and so on, but the concept of dividing British regions by shires actually derives from reforms made by Aelfred of Wessex a bit after the timeline of the game **(Keynes 232).** The shire system of English administrative division originated in Wessex in the mid 800s CE and was never exported outside the region until *after* Edington (Late 878 CE) and beyond **(Morris 185).** I suppose the British Shire system proved useful for the game's map builders but it's a case of conflation all the same.\n\n**MAIN CAMPAIGN**\n\nAssassin's Creed **Valhalla doesn't really have a linear campaign**. It has a quest structure which you can complete in mostly any order, one that ends when you reach Level 280 in the game's XP status. This unlocks the questline that brings about the final missions that ends the story of Eivor, Basim and Sigurd, the three focal characters of the narrative. To reach Level 280 one has to complete all the quests in the full map save for \"Hamtunscire\" in the South. **Upon finishing the game's main story, you have to complete two more side-quests** (\"The Order of the Ancients\", \"The Alliance Map\") to effectively conclude the main historical segment of this game.\n\n* **Most of the historical figures are minor figures such as Oswald, King of East Anglia**. All we know of King Oswald was that there are coins minted in his name from the period, and he's believed to have been a puppet King of the Vikings. So there's literally nothing to be said for or against his representation here. The first villain of the game is Kjotve the Cruel who in history was known as Kjotve the Rich who was one of the many petty kings defeated by the legendary Harald Fairhair. The **\"Discovery Tour: Viking Age\"** points out the lack of historicity about Fairhair.\n* In England, a lot of the regional missions follow a pattern: Eivor wanders into a region, intervenes on questions of who should be Ealdorman or King or whatnot, and in exchange gets a promise of an alliance to her \"Raven Clan\". This is roughly accurate to the current understanding of Viking conquests during the Great Heathen Army's invasion. The Vikings allied with local thegns, ealdormen, and Kings, and established their own client kings\\*\\*(Morris 212-214).\\*\\*\n* Among the game's most interesting characters is Ivarr the Boneless, one of the famous sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, who like many Vikings is more legendary than true. Ivarr the Boneless is there to embody the \"Bad Viking\" but he's also a compelling villain who's entertaining to watch, that the story as it is kind of dries up after he dies midway into the \"Alliance\" sequences. He appears as an agent propping up King Ceolwulf of Mercia. In the game Ceolwulf is a Saxon king and ally of the Vikings, whose son Ceolbert becomes part of a cruel plot by Ivarr in his rivalry with King Rhodri. King Rhodri is an actual historical figure and he did in fact win notable victories against the Vikings as presented here. That said there's no record of any rivalry with Ivarr, and Rhodri's death and defeat came in a battle against Saxon kings (who he opposed as much as he did the Vikings). Here he's presented as a personal enemy who's brutally murdered by Ivarr and submitted to the famous blood eagle.\n* The blood eagle is an act of ritual killing that has *zero* historical evidence. It's only attested in Norse sagas, but not in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle **(Morris, 197).** The most famous legend is when King Aella of Northumbria was submitted to it by Ragnar's sons in revenge but the Chronicle records him dying in battle. Most historians doubt this because it's only mentioned in Sagas composed orally centuries later.\n* Other historical figures are tucked away in the corner. **Ganger Hrolf/Rollo the Walker** appears in the Essexe region story arc in a minor role as a 17 year old. There's little record of Rollo the Walker's life before 885 CE **(Haywood 97-98).** He's shown as a lithe young man when historically, Hrolf/Rollo was so huge he couldn't ride a horse, leading to his suffix of \"the Walker\".\n* **Supposedly Ljuvina Bjarmasdottir and her husband Hjorr is a real historical figure.** But I've not been to locate any historical sources verifying this. Academic searches lead to dead ends. The one website attesting this claims it gets the information from author Bergsveinn Birgisson who researching his family history came across this material and used it for his novel \"The Black Viking\". I'm chalking right now to a \"maybe **\\[2\\]**\n* **As Mary Beard argued recently, racial diversity has a long history in Britain\\[3\\].** The Viking invasions saw England reacquainted with global trade so in terms of verisimilitude I accept the presence of the various diverse characters here. Archeological evidence from Torskey reveals Arab Dirhem coins **(Haywood 53).** Likewise remains from the Jorvik Coppergate ruins have found artefacts from across the world **(Haywood 70).**\n* King Halfdan Ragnarsson was, per legend, the youngest son of the Ragnarssons and also the most solidly historical.

We see Picts as woad-wearing barbarians from the Roman past, but at this time they would have been mostly Christianized and not very different culturally speaking from the other characters we see here. The Picts were also brutally suppressed during the Viking Age, and essentially subject to ethnic cleansing and cultural erasure in this time, so I think presenting them as essentially Orcs, albeit with a Glaswegian accent, is unfair **(Haywood 120-122)**.\n* The regional arcs Gloucestrescire which shows a Wicker Man sacrifice is totally fictional, as are most of the regional arcs in places like Suth-Sexe and Cent and so on. The most important historical figure we see in the game is of course King Aelfred of Wessex, he threads through multiple layers across the game, including Two Epilogue Sections. In the \"Hamtunscire\" Alliance Map, that happens after the main (fictional) story ends, we see Aelfred confront Guthrum at the Battle of Cippenham, which led to Aelfred's defeat and fugitive retreat but which the game presents as a Pyrrhic Victory for the Northmen. This is of course a harbinger of the Battle of Edington whose aftermath we see in **\"Discovery Tour: Viking Age\"** and the Epilogue Last Chapter missions.

But the actual wealth stolen by the Vikings from monastery raids was relics, liturgical books, decorations, and slaves.\n\n&gt;\"Saints’ relics were frequently housed in shrines embellished with precious metals and jewels, reflecting their spiritual value and encouraging devotion among the faithful...a list of the many relics remaining at St. Bavo in Ghent after the Vikings had been and gone included a spine from Christ’s crown of thorns which had supposedly been set in gold and precious stones by St. Eligius himself.\"  \n**Simon Coupland**, **Page 80.**\n\nIn the game whenever we go inside the monastery interiors during Abbey raids, we hardly ever see the bling on offer, being scuttled by the Vikings. The wealth stolen by the Vikings were often sold to local and international markets and, in Coupland's view, often melted down by the Vikings to create jewelry, such as the silver arm-rings we often see characters in the game exchange during weddings and other ceremonies **(Coupland 90-91)**.\n\n**SLAVERY**\n\nThe big elephant in the room with AC Valhalla is of course **the question of slavery**.Quite a few commentators have accused Valhalla of whitewashing the role of Vikings in the slave trade. That's true **but it's not just the Vikings who are whitewashed**.\n\n* In the early mission where you settle Ravensthorpe, called \"The Raven and the Cuckoo\" after solving an issue caused by Saxon prisoners, Eivor remarks that perhaps they can \"trade him for a pig\". We see a more direct representation of slavery in the **\"Discovery Tour: Viking Age\"** story missions focusing on Thorstein, a sympathetic Norse tradesman who owns a thrall, treats him well, who attains manumission and then enters into willing partnership with Thorstein, his former master. **What the game misses though is acknowledging the existence of slavery in Christian Anglo-Saxon society,** the period of history where Catholics enslaved fellow Catholics, sold them to fellow Catholics, and kept them in bondage. Within the game, the few mentions of slavery are exclusively seen in Viking society when in fact slavery was rife across Europe and the Catholic Church was deeply embedded in the institution.\n* The most famous anecdote about the Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England, involves Pope Gregory the Great going to a slave market and seeing some English boys on the market and remarking, according to Venerable Bede, \"non Angli, sed Angeli\" **(Morris 58).** Not Angles, but Angels. What Pope Gregory did not do was free the slave boys, instead he purchased them and later dispatched and supported efforts to spread Christianity among Anglo-Saxon England **(Serfass 87-88).** Pope Gregory the Great, like many Popes of his era, before and after, was a slaveowner **(Serfass 77).**\n* Slavery existed in Anglo-Saxon England, *before* the Viking Age and *after* Christianization of the Saxons. a fact not acknowledged in this game. During the reign of the Mercian King Offa, London was already an international slave market, well before the Viking invasions **(Morris 138)**. Aelfred of Wessex *was* in fact an impressive ruler for his time and place, but the game ignores the fact that **Alfred's Wessex was a slave society.**\n\n&gt;\"An even more basic division was between freedom and servitude. Alfred's Wessex was a slave society. No one can even begin to estimate how many slaves (or free men, for that matter) there was in ninth-century Wessex, but from Alfred's laws it is clear that even ceorls owned slaves.**\"**  \n**Richard Abels. PAGE 36**\n\n* Slavery of course increased tenfold during the Viking Age, as a result of Viking activity. Emphasizing the existence and continuity of slavery in Anglo-Saxon England is not the same as downplaying the Viking contribution in heightening it. It's absolutely true that Vikings targeted slaves in Ireland, England, France and elsewhere and that Dublin was the biggest slave market in Europe during this time. Whether slavery was an inherent part of Viking religion has no real evidence. After all, Vikings after Christianization continued being a slaveowning and slave-trading society, in the same way Imperial Rome, Byzantine Empire and likewise the Anglo-Saxons continued slavery. In general, the only significant exception was the Franks who did look down against enslaving fellow Franks (albeit not non-Franks) **(Coupland 80).**\n* **In general for the common person, there would not have been a great deal of difference between Viking England and Anglo-Saxon England**. As noted by Patricia Dutchak, the Bishop Wulfstan, Archbishop of York, in 1014 CE, advocated for a stratified society where everybody knew their place and, \"He was deeply shocked that runaway slaves had not only been accepted into the Danish army, but achieved a greater social status and received more honour than their former masters\" **(Dutchak 36).**\n\nThe \"slavery\" discourse of AC Valhalla has led to some telling responses. This article by Brett Deveraux, shows up in a variety of places online **\\[6\\].** Deveraux takes issue with the game's presentation of the Norse as protagonists while downplaying and sanitizing their actions. The article talks of the \"Norse practice of slavery\" and claiming that Christians militated \"against the Norse practice of slavery\" while ignoring the existence and flourishing of slavery in Anglo-Saxon Christian communities and across Christian Europe. Looking at the game carefully, AC Valhalla does ultimately validate this \"clash of civilizations\" contrast more than Deveraux credits, but the existence of this ahistorical assumption and not overturning it is the problem here and AC Valhalla I guess ought to be credited for at least challenging this assumption somewhat.\n\nEND OF PART 1(LINK FOR PART 2 WILL APPEAR HERE)\n\n**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WORKS CITED**\n\n**TEXTS**\n\n* ABELS, Richard.

        "text": "Hello, it’s me, the world famous badhistory user who posted twice ever about a year ago. But don’t worry, I have returned to claim my rightful place as the king of complaining about [topics no one cares about](https://youtu.be/Rqa3sgSncdk), and I’ve got a real doozy for today. \n\n About a year ago, the famous YouTube channel Kings and Generals (who I will be calling K&amp;G) started their series on the history of the Celtic people, which hasn’t been... the *best.*\n\n Their [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/pwdequ/bitesized_badhistory_kings_and_generals_think/) and [third](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/tchsvq/bitesized_badhistory_kings_and_generals_once/) videos have been criticised by [u/ByzantineBasileus](https://www.reddit.com/user/ByzantineBasileus/), while I myself wrote a post on their [5th video](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/umqmbf/kings_and_generals_the_anglosaxon_invasion_of/), which revealed that K&amp;G had chosen a random website as their source to present information as fact (despite the website being, without exaggeration, 100% inaccurate) to their 2,800,000 subscribers.  \n(Their 6th video on King Arthur is also not very good, but I held off on writing a post about that one as it’s mostly bad mythology, rather than bad history). \n\nOf course, the person who writes these videos (they’re all written by the same guy) don’t actually list their sources, that’s for nerd losers, not cool guys on the internet. Luckily for us, my cranium is large enough to expertly figure out exactly what source they are using at any given time, and this time we’re going to encounter another weird choice of material.  \nYou see, after a 6 month hiatus, this series is back, and it’s taken us to medieval Wales, aka an area that I actually know something about, and the results are exactly as expected: *partially* correct but also with a bunch of bizarre inaccuracies and details that are seemingly made up on the spot, making it hard to recommend yet also hard to dissuade someone from watching them.\n\nRegardless, today I’m going to take a look at this video: [Celtic Britons: the Origins of Medieval Wales](https://youtu.be/Rqa3sgSncdk), with my next post looking at the follow up: [Wales During the Viking Age](https://youtu.be/fSbbrTMsohg).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 'The Picts and the Anglo-Saxons'\n\nThe first thing I’d like to point out is less of a criticism but more of a funny detail. The castle adorned with the Welsh flag shown in the thumbnail (and in the first 40 seconds of the video) is [Bodiam Castle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Bodiam-castle-10My8-1197.jpg) in Sussex, not Wales, and while I personally don’t mind the Welsh flag being featured, it’s worth noting that it is historically inaccurate for the time period, with the dragon (\\~9th century), the colours (15th century), and the flag itself (1959) all being created outside of the timeline of this video.\n\nThis is immediately followed by an ad for Established Titles, which, if you aren’t aware, were revealed as a massive scam shortly after this video. Unfortunate.\n\nFollowing this, at 2:28 a map is shown of Great Britain and Ireland prior to the Roman conquest of what is now England and Wales. Two labels on here stand out, the \"Pictes\" and the \"Gaëls\". Not only does this reveal the fun detail that the person who made this map is [French](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%C3%ABls), but it also seems to show that K&amp;G don't *really* know a lot about this time period.\n\nFirstly, it is debated whether the Pictish people existed prior to the Roman invasion, as the historian Charles-Edwards notes:\n\n&gt;In the early Romano-British period the population of Britain beyond the frontier was considered to be no less British than the peoples to the south. From the end of the third century this changed.\n\nThe Britons beyond the Antonine Wall appear to have begun to be identified by a different name, potentially due to the comparative lack of Roman influence compared to their southern neighbours (Charles-Edwards 2013 p.89-91). Furthermore the Irish migrations, raids, and colonisations of Western Britain *also* appear to have taken place from around the 3rd-5th centuries (Charles-Edwards 2013 p.469), unless you subscribe to the theory that the Irish of Dal Riata were actually there the whole time.\n\nMoving on, from 2:38 to 2:48, K&amp;G say:\n\n&gt;Throughout the 5th and 6th centuries AD, Germanic tribes like the Angles, Saxon, Jutes and Frisians, began making increasing headway into the isle. \n\nThis date estimate is *alright*, [more recent studies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05247-2) have placed this migration period from sometime during Roman rule to about the 8th century, but this is a very recent paper so perhaps they didn’t want to include it just yet, I will give them props for finally acknowledging the Frisians and the Franks (on their map at least), though. It’s a shame their map of England still divides the country neatly into Angle, Saxon, as Jute lands, despite the fact that this division, and even the mere existence of the Jutes has been debated for decades already.\n\nFrom 2:48 to 2:55 we have:\n\n&gt;Whether this was defined by large-scale invasion, or by relatively peaceful assimilation is still up for debate. \n\nWhile yes it is true that the mechanisms of the Anglo-Saxon migrations are still up for debate, the notion of it being a large scale invasion hasn’t been popular for a very long time, as the [2022 paper says](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05247-2), there is a substantial discrepancy between the claims in the primary sources and the actual archaeological record. The theory of it being a large scale invasion was much more popular with the Victorians, speaking of which: \n\n3:02-3:15: \n\n&gt;By 600 AD, the eastern lowlands of Britain were dominated by the Germanic ancestors of the English, while Celtic-speaking polities, the ancestors of the Welsh, were **pushed into the Western highlands**. \n\nThis is *old school*, some proper Victorian, penny-farthing style stuff. I’m sure there are some who still support this hypothesis, but you’d be hard pressed to find an actual historian who would back you up on this. \n\nThere is, first of all, no evidence that the Anglo-Saxons pushed all of the Britons out of England. Not only because that would be a demographic shift of a high estimate of [3.7 million people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1635457/), (that left behind absolutely no evidence), but also because their own laws make references to the “Welsh” still present in these Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, not to mention the presence of Brythonic names in England, including two notable ones of Cerdic and Caedwalla, the kings of Wessex.\n\nSecond of all, this is just [Gildas’s polemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Excidio_et_Conquestu_Britanniae) taken at face value (again, some Victorian-style stuff), which is not at all a popular (or even viable) method or hypothesis.\n\nThirdly, if we can go into genetics for a bit, Germanic DNA makes up only [10-40% of the modern DNA of England](https://peopleofthebritishisles.web.ox.ac.uk/population-genetics), and while yes over time these %s will become skewered, if literally all of the Celtic-speaking people were removed from England, you’d expect the Germanic % to be a little bit higher, no? Or at least the so-called “Celtic” % to be significantly lower, potentially at zero?  Anyway, this is getting too complex, and this isn’t a post on this hypothesis, I'm sure there will be some grumbling over my very short breakdown of a 200-year-old misconception, but let’s continue. \n\n(Higham and Ryan 2013, pp.95-103; Gretzinger et al. 2022)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 'Celtic Christianity and the Time-Travelling Corpse'\n\nMoving on from the Anglo-Saxons, from 3:15 to 3:26 we have the unusual passage of: \n\n&gt;Throughout medieval history, there was **never a single Welsh state**, but rather a multitude of smaller kingdoms united culturally, through a shared corpus of folklore and similar languages. \n\nThis is a bit odd/ridiculously incorrect, because there *was* a singular Welsh state, in the early 11th century a king named Gruffydd united the whole of Wales into one kingdom. Not to mention the existence of two kings who were said to have been overlords over all of Wales, Maelgwn and Cadwallon, although you might choose not to count indirect rule, but this portion would be incorrect regardless (J. Davies 2007, pp.97-99). \n\nAnd then to add more confusion to this already muddled beginning, from 3:41 to 3:47, K&amp;G tell us that they are going to:\n\n&gt; refer \\[to the Welsh, and the Celtic-speakers of Great Britain\\] interchangeably as the Britons, Brittonic, Brythonic, or Cumbric peoples. \n\n**Why?** Britons, Brittonic or Brythonic peoples is *fine* when referring to the Celtic-speaking of the entire island, but I would argue against the usefulness of using “Welsh”. While yes Germanic speakers did call them all “Wealas”, this applied to a huge group of people and has left its mark all across Europe from Wallachia to Wallonia to Wales. In English “Welsh” applies only to the *modern* people of Wales nowadays, and it’s just going to make things confusing in my opinion. If you, for whatever reason, desire *more* than three already perfectly good nouns, then the Welsh term Cymry could be used instead.  \nAlso \"Cumbric\" refers to people from [Cumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbria), or more broadly a vague Celtic area around southern Scotland and modern day Cumbria, in any case it’s extremely local and a terrible term to use in a broad sense. It’d be like calling all Americans “Texans”.\n\nMoving on, I do appreciate K&amp;Gs attempts to shine a light on the culture of this area and era, from 4:17 to 5:33, even if the video so far hasn’t been very good I still want to give them praise for giving time to some less-discussed aspects.  \nShortly after this though, we face some more problems. K&amp;G move onto the topic of Christianity, and despite being accurate in the cultural portion of this video, they seem to have a bit of a misunderstanding of the Welsh church. \n\nThey say from 6:37 to 6:48 that: \n\n&gt;Between the 6th and 8th centuries, Celtic Christianity was fairly isolated from its mother church in Rome, and this developed certain schismatic beliefs, such as a different method in calculating the date of Easter. \n\nThis paragraph, while seeming innocuous, is really symptomatic of the **broader issue of this entire series**: the “Celts” are a *linguistic grouping*. Sure there are some similar factors, but even common elements like their material culture and architecture could vary wildly, some do not even like using the term \"Celts\", as it may portray the image of a far more unified people than reality. K&amp;G in this series have treated them as such, describing the unified “armies” and uniform “battle tactics” of the Celts as a single group, and now they are attempting to describe their churches as a monolithic Celtic entity. \n\nThere is really no such thing as \"Celtic Christianity\". Sure, Irish Christianity shared a lot of roots with the Welsh thanks to the latter’s extensive missionary work, and they had some similar traits, but to portray them as monolithic church is very controversial, and they didn’t exactly agree on everything, including the date of Easter.\n\nFirstly, the various Celtic-speaking people did not “calculate the date of Easter differently”, they used the original date that the church decided upon in AD 314, while Rome used a different date that *they* decided upon in AD 457. \n\nSecondly, the Celts did not all agree with keeping the original date, and they did not all switch at the same time. The Southern Irish accepted the Roman date in **630**, Strathclyde changed in **688**, the north of Ireland in **697**, Iona in **716**, and finally the Welsh in **768**.   \nThirdly and finally, this was not because the Welsh were “disconnected from Rome”, in fact during the 5th and 6th centuries they had *substantial contact* with Rome. The historian John Davies even refutes this point in his book:\n\n&gt;It was the desire to abide by the traditions of the fathers, rather than ignorance of the change, which is the most satisfactory explanation for the conservatism of the Celts; as has been seen, they did not, between 457 and 603, lack contact with the shores of the Mediterranean. \n\n(J. Davies 2007, pp.75-76)\n\nBut who needs sources right? So far I’m not even *entirely* sure what they’ve been using. The Anglo-Saxon misconception has been repeated excessively by them, (they even have a whole video parroting it), but the non-existence of a unified (albeit temporary) Wales? Portraying the churches of the Celtic-language speaking peoples as unified? Claiming that *they* calculated the date of Easter differently? This is just incorrect, and to be honest it reads like they made it up themselves. Being as these videos all have the same author, I am not surprised that the same fundamental problems keep coming up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpeaking of making stuff up, are you ready for the most bizarre thing in this entire video? From 6:50-6:59 K&amp;G state:\n\n&gt;By the 9th century, these schisms had largely been healed, due to kings like Cyngen ap Cadell of Powys, who were recorded to have made pilgrimages to Rome. \n\nThat's not to bad right? A king travels to Rome and helps heal the schism between Rome and the “Celtic Church”? An issue with this however, comes straight from K&amp;G themselves, as in the corner of this portion of the video they note that: \n\n&gt; Cyngen is recorded to have died on this journey, however.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*So how did he heal the schism if he was dead?* \n\nK&amp;G claim firstly, that this schism in the date of Easter was changed in the 9th century, secondly that this was largely due to king Cyngen of Powys, who made a pilgrimage to Rome, and thirdly, that Cyngen never went to Rome, because he died en route.\n\nHow does any of this make sense? Disregarding for the moment that literally none of this is true, *how could Cyngen heal the schism if he died before getting to Rome?* This isn't, like, the worst thing in the entire world, but for God's sake *their own paragraph* (that they wrote, *presumably* read, spoke out loud and then animated) doesn't make any sense within its own context, and this isn't even mentioning how it's completely incorrect!\n\nFirstly, Cyngen is recorded to have died *in* Rome, not on his way to Rome, as is recorded in the Annales Cambriae:\n\n&gt;AD 854: Cinnen rex pouis inroma obiit.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(AD 854 (*recte* 855) Cygen, King of Powys, dies in Rome).\n\n(Philimore 1888, p.165)\n\nSecondly, you may have noticed that Cyngen died in 855. Do you remember when I said Wales changed its dating of Easter?\n\n**AD 768?**\n\nThirdly, no where does it say that Cyngen was on a pilgrimage, only that he died in Rome. His kingdom, Powys, had seemingly been conquered in 822 by the English kingdom of Mercia, and he was most likely in exile in Rome, *not* on a pilgrimage for 33 years (Bartrum 1993, p.202).\n\nFourthly, the date was changed in *Wales* by a man named Elfoddw, the Archbishop of Gwynedd (J. Davies 2007, pp.75-76), the date change *elsewhere* in the Celtic-speaking world was dependent on different people and factors. \n\nSo, to summarise this portion. K&amp;G claim that a *corpse* arrived in Rome to heal the schism between them and a non-existent “Celtic Church” calculating the dates of Easter differently. They ignore the fact that Cyngen did arrive in Rome *alive*, ***40 years after the date had already been changed*** in Wales by someone else, and nearly ***two centuries*** after it had been changed elsewhere?!\n\nThis paragraph is what enticed me to write this entire post. How did they not notice that the words they were putting on the screen directly contradicted what they were saying out loud? Why do they think that a king of a single Welsh kingdom had the power to change the date of Easter for the entire Celtic-speaking world? Why do they think he did this 200 years after the date had already begun to have been changed? And finally why do they think that he was able to do this whilst being dead?\n\nYou may be wondering where they got this from, and with my 22 IQ points I can easily calculate the origin: [Wikipedia dot com/org.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyngen_ap_Cadell) \n\nHere is the claim that Cyngen was on a pilgrimage between 822 and 855, rather than being in exile, and we even have the source of all this ridiculousness:\n\n&gt;\\[Cyngen\\] went on a pilgrimage to Rome and died there in 854. He is thought to be the first Welsh ruler to visit Rome after the healing of the breach between the Welsh branch of the Celtic Church and Rome over the date of Easter.  \n\nThis, very ironically, *may be true*. I am unaware of any other Welsh kings that went to Rome in this period, although again we have no evidence that Cyngen travelled to Rome for a pilgrimage.\n\nWhat I find most hilarious about this, is that ***Kings and Generals read the bloody thing wrong!*** It doesn't say that Cyngen healed the schism, it says that he was the first to visit *after* the schism had already been healed. It also doesn't say that he died en route, only that he died \"during a pilgrimage to Rome\".\n\nWe also see here where K&amp;G got their information on the \"Celtic Christianity\" from, as the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Christianity) pertains its existence, while also again hilariously adding that various scholars reject the notion of its existence. I guess K&amp;G just skipped that part, huh? \n\nNeither of the statements I mentioned in the Cyngen article even have *citations*, why would you assume they're correct, and repeat these words to your nearly 3 million subscribers? I just find this so ridiculous, but I think it'd be best if we finally move on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 'Final Quibbles'\n\nThe next portions of these videos are dedicated to the north and south of Britain, and unfortunately I am not knowledgeable enough to comment on these, although if they’re at all like the rest of the video so far then I imagine they’re not accurate at all, although I think it’d be hard to beat the claim that a corpse time travelled 40 years into the past in order to change the date of Easter in Wales. \n\nWe can first return for some minor quibbles from 12:05, where K&amp;G, during their description of the westward expansion of the English kingdoms have included a text box claiming that:\n\n&gt;Some historians claim that it was due to this geographical separation that the Celtic dialect of Cornwall and Wales began diverging into the separate Cornish and Welsh languages of today.\n\nOf course by \"some historians\" they mean Kenneth Jackson in his book ‘Language and History in Early Britain’... which was written in 1953... and has been heavily criticised/outright dismissed since the 1980s (W. Davies 1982, p.112), hardly a contemporary hypothesis.\n\nFrom 12:56-12:58 K&amp;G claim that Devon was conquered by Essex, rather than *Wessex.*\n\nAnd finally as we return to Wales K&amp;G's map shows the region of Ystrad Tywi (the dark orange portion of their map seen at 14:00) as an independent kingdom, despite the fact that there is no evidence for this, and that the region is heavily associated with the kingdom of Dyfed.\n\nBut who cares about these lesser issues right? How about one final Wikipedia-escapade instead. From 14:05-14:19:\n\n&gt;In 642, Penda, now king of the Mercians, would once more meet the Northern Angles in battle, alongside an alliance of Briton warriors from Powys and Gwynedd, the latter of whom had been sent by king Cadwaladr, son of the infamous Cadwallon. \n\nOnce again, this is straight from the [Wikipedia article on the Battle of Maserfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Maserfield), which contains all sorts of uncited rubbish, gladly repeated verbatim by K&amp;G.\n\nFirstly, neither the Annales Cambriae, Bede, or the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle say that \\*any\\* Welsh forces were present at the battle of Maserfield, unlike what K&amp;G claim. A single, fragmented Welsh poem exists that claims a man named Cynddylan of Pengwern fought at “Maes Cogwy” (i.e. Maserfield), which is not unreasonable, as the Mercians had aligned with the Welsh before, it’s just not mentioned anywhere else (Bartrum 1993, p.191-192).  \nFurthermore, Pengwern is (probably) not the same as the kingdom of Powys, and it is *definitely* not the same as Gwynedd, who are never mentioned anywhere as fighting in this battle, again unlike what K&amp;G and Wikipedia claim.  \nIn fact, even Wikipedia inadvertently prove their own article (and K&amp;G) wrong, as they both claim king Cadwaladr of Gwynedd was present at the battle in 642, but Wikipedia states that he also only became king in 655.\n\nIn reality it does not appear that Gwynedd was involved in this battle at all. Cadwaladr was not yet king, despite K&amp;G’s claims, as his succession had been usurped by a man named Cadafael, who would later ally with the Mercians in 655.  \nSo again, as with the previous paragraph, this is just plain wrong, not over simplified, or missing a few details, it just didn’t happen. \n\nAnd that wraps up the video. To conclude, this video is a bizarre mess of accuracies and inaccuracies. When they get their information right, it really shines, but when they start misreading uncited statements off of Wikipedia, it becomes completely comical, culminating in the claim that a time-travelling corpse changed the date of Easter for the mythical Celtic Church, 200 years after these changes had begun to take place.\n\nAs I said in my last post, a common response for criticisms like these is that these videos are meant to serve as an introduction, and that I shouldn't criticise channels that you like watching. As an introduction, this video is terrible. Not only does it contain no sources, but the vast majority of it is completely incorrect. They parrot Victorian-era hypotheses of an Anglo-Saxon extermination, portray the Celts as a monolithic people, and again they just read sentences off of Wikipedia that *don't have any citations*!\n\nThanks for reading all of this, hopefully it was enjoyable, I'll write up my post on the second video eventually and link it here, cheers.\n\nBibliography:\n\nGenerals, K. a.

        "text": "While this defense is common among lost causers and r/HistoryMemes, the idea that Thomas Jefferson was unable to free his slaves due to Virginia law is complete and utter nonsense. This particular bit of stupidity comes from evangelical \"\"\"\"historian\"\"\"\" David Barton and his book \"The Jefferson Lies\". Barton's book says that\n\n&gt;If Jefferson was indeed so antislavery, then why didn't he release his own slaves? After all, George Washington allowed for the freeing of his slaves on his death in 1799, so why didn't Jefferson at least do the same at his death in 1826? The answer is Virginia law. In 1799, Virginia allowed owners to emancipate their slaves on their death; in 1826, state laws had been changed to prohibit that practice.\n\nAdditionally, he claimed on a radio show that it was illegal to free any slaves during one's life.\n\nThis claim is very easily disproved by the fact that Jefferson [freed two slaves before his death and five after](https://www.monticello.org/research-education/thomas-jefferson-encyclopedia/slaves-who-gained-freedom/). Likely, the reasoning for this being excluded is ~~that Barton is a dumb son of a bitch who wouldn't know proper research if it bit his microdick off~~ an honest mistake, I'm sure.\n\nBut let's ignore that very blatant evidence disproving Barton. Let's look at how he quotes Virginia law.\n\n&gt;Those persons who are disposed to emancipate their slaves may be empowered so to do, and ... it shall hereafter be lawful for any person, by his or her last will and testament ... to emancipate and set free, his or her slaves.\n\nWow, those sure are a lot of ellipses. I wonder what the parts which got cut out were? Let's show them in bold.\n\n&gt;Those persons who are disposed to emancipate their slaves may be empowered so to do, **and the same hath been judged expedient under certain restrictions: Be it therefore enacted,** That it shall hereafter be lawful for any person, by his or her last will and testament, **or by any other instrument in writing, under his or her hand and seal, attested and proved in the county court by two witnesses, or acknowledged by the party in the court of the county where he or she resides** to emancipate and set free, his or her slaves, **or any of them, who shall thereupon be entirely and fully discharged from the performance of any contract entered into during servitude, and enjoy as full freedom as if they had been particularly named and freed by this act.**\n\nYou may have missed it, so let's repeat the extra-important part he cut out\n\n&gt;or by any other instrument in writing, under his or her hand and seal, attested and proved in the county court by two witnesses, or acknowledged by the party in the court of the county where he or she resides\n\nThe law very specifically makes provisions which allow people to free their slaves with *any* legal document, not just a will, at any time. David Barton conveniently cut this part out because he ~~is a miserable little shit who jacks off to pictures of dead deer~~ forgot to put on his reading glasses.\n\nBarton's book goes on to make a number of patently idiotic claims, such as the idea that Thomas Jefferson was a devout Christian, but I'm already too exhausted by his bullshit to deal with him. Barton's book was so stupidly, obsessively fake that his publisher, Thomas Nelson, dropped it. Thomas Nelson, the extremely Christian publisher whose best selling non-fiction book is about how magic Jesus butterflies saved a child's life when doctors couldn't. Those guys felt like Barton was too inaccurate and Christian. The book was also voted \"Least accurate book in print\" by the History News Network.\n\nDespite the fact that it was rightfully denounced by every single fucking person who read it, Barton re-published it again later, claiming to be a victim of getting \"canceled\" because he was too close to the truth. Unfortunately, it fits into the exact belief that a number of people want to have: that Jefferson was a super chill dude who has had his legacy trashed by those woke snowflakes. It still maintains a great deal of traction and circulation in Evangelical and conservative circles. Typically, the people recommending it and quoting it tend to be those who pronounce \"black\" with two g's.\n\n---\n\nI'm not gonna lie, in the middle of debunking this specific claim, I went down an Internet rabbithole. While there, I found out that this was not just a specific stupid claim. In fact, it was arguably one of the *least* racist things this human waste of carbon has said throughout his career.\n\nBarton's work as a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"historian\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" includes other lovely factoids, such as the fact that scientists were unable to develop an AIDS vaccine because God wants the bodies of homosexuals to be marked forever, that the Founding Fathers were all super-duper Christian and wanted religious authorities to rule the country, and that Native Americans totally had it coming. He has also claimed that members of the homosexual community get more than 500 sexual partners. Frankly, I'd like to know where those assholes are, because statistically I should have burned through at least a hundred by now. Lil Nas X, you selfish bastard, save some for the rest of us.\n\nI don't hate myself enough to spend the time reading and debunking every single one of Barton's bigoted comments (although I may turn this into a series, because he has a *lot* of content). But as I was about to click away from the page, I found one specific one which was so patently stupid, and fit with today so well that I had to share it.\n\nHe claimed that Martin Luther King Jr. (along with Hugo Chavez) should be removed from history textbooks because white people like Jefferson were the *real* reason racial equality occurred. He stated that “Only majorities can expand political rights in America’s constitutional society\".\n\nI'm not even going to bother pretending like that needs to be \"debunked\", because it's so stupidly, obscenely wrong that to even pretend as if he's making a real point is insulting.\n\nIn a later article, [he apparently reversed his opinion](https://wallbuilders.com/martin-luther-king-jr/) on MLK after remembering MLK was a preacher, and that fit with his idea that Christianity is responsible for every good thing in America. Then , he praises \"nine out of ten\" of their Ten Commandments pledge, and says that everyone should follow just those nine. The tenth which doesn't approve of? Helping the Civil Rights movement however possible. You can't make this shit up.\n\n**Disclaimer:** It is true that Barton is a relatively significant member in the Republican party. In the interest of rule 5, I want to make it clear that none of this is politically motivated, and I found out about his party affiliation after I had written most of this. I am calling Barton a brainless piece of irradiated bat shit because I truly believe that he *is* a brainless piece of irradiated bat shit, not because of his political views. His bad history speaks for itself.\n\n**Source:**\n\n[https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/an-act-to-authorize-the-manumission-of-slaves-1782/](https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/an-act-to-authorize-the-manumission-of-slaves-1782/)",

        "text": "Despite claiming to be \"based on actual history\", this movie about America's founding is riddled with inaccuracies. I've created a list here of the most glaring and obvious ones.\n\nShortly before Benedict Arnold arrives to kill everyone as they sign the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson loses at beer pong, and mentions that \"At Dartmouth, we use paddles\". However, the first recorded instance of \"Darthmouth pong\" occurred in 1951, with the first photo of it from 1961^(1). I have looked up public records of all Dartmouth yearbooks since 1951, and have found no records of Thomas Jefferson going to school there at that time. So it'd be impossible for him to learn about using paddles to play beer pong.\n\nShortly after that, as Benedict Arnold escapes Ford's theater (after revealing himself as a werewolf and killing Abraham Lincoln), he shouts \"Sic semper my dick bitches!\" However, as Cassell's *Dictionary of Slang* records, \"dick\" first began to be used to refer to one's penis in the mid 1800s^(2). The Oxford English dictionary has it even later, with the first recording of that meaning in 1891^(3). It makes absolutely no sense for Arnold to yell this as he interrupted Martha Washington's drum solo.\n\nDuring the carriage chase that follows this scene, Benedict Arnold's car-carriage is shown to have the bumper sticker \"Keep calm and bugger off\". This is, frankly, ridiculous. \"Keep calm and carry on\" was a slogan used by the British crown in the 1940s^(4). Arnold's coach is making a reference he would have no idea about.\n\nThe movie begins to fall slightly more in line with reality after this, as George Washington begins to put together an army to fight the British. Granted, that army has five people in it, rather than 231,000, but still, technically closer to real history.\n\n However, they then commit one of their most egregious mistakes yet: during George and Martha Washington's sex scene, Martha is shown to have what Stephen King would call \"huge badonkawhoosies\", or potentially \"ginormous honkas\". As we can see from one of [Martha's portraits](https://imgur.com/a/S0Uhhzn), her breasts were not in fact larger than her head^(5).\n\nAfter that, when breaking into the Vietnam bar to try and catch Arnold, George Washington kicks down the door and shouts \"Ding dong, it's America motherfucker!\" This doesn't make sense at all, and the writers clearly haven't done their research. While doorbells did exist at the time, the \"ding dong\" bell sound we are familiar with was not introduced until the 1930s. Instead, they used smaller bells attached to ropes, which would ring multiple times^(6). Therefore, Washington should have said \"Ring ^(ring ring ring ring) it's America motherfucker!\"\n\nSwitching to a design issue, [see if you can find the problem with Thomas Edison's design](https://imgur.com/a/UeDuifo). It's just more proof that they don't give a shit about historical accuracy: she's wearing a Langdorf style tie, which wasn't developed until 1922^(7). Even worse, it's clearly tied in a Windsor knot, which didn't come into style until the 1930s^(8). \n\nMuch later on, when George Washington is shown trying to fight the Redcoats with his chainsaw hands, it is revealed that Benedict Arnold has sucked the gas out of said chainsaws as George slept. Arnold then holds up a gas container to prove it. However, the gas can shown is a jerrycan, which was invented in 1937^(9). Specifically, the can shown is a British model that rose to popularity in the last few decades. So it would have been impossible for Arnold to store any gas in it at all. Frankly, I hope someone got fired over that humiliating mistake.\n\nSide note, which is less about historical accuracy, but... why did Paul Revere's Scottish horse talk to him in Spanish? With a Mexican accent? \n\nBut worst off all are the inaccuracies contained in the final battle ([which you can watch part of here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKLW-eZ1PRM&amp;ab_channel=MalachiBlood)). It'd take way too long to adress all of them, so here are some quick bullet points\n\n* When jumping from the sky, Geronimo yells \"Me-ronimo!\" instead of \"Geronimo!\" Seriously, how do you fuck that up? He's known for yelling exactly one thing, which also happened to be his name. It's, like, the easiest detail to get right. \n* George Washington uses Mozart's guitar to play \"America's national anthem\". Despite that, the song is clearly just Free Bird. \n* In a nice moment of genuine accuracy, Edison *does* use her lightning to kill an elephant. This is the most accurate part of the whole movie. \n* Despite being a reference to the Galactic Empire from Star Wars, the British say \"roger roger\", which is the Trade Federation. Come on guys. \n* The British kill both Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox, despite the fact that Babe actually was killed in a hunting accident in the 1980s, [as seen here](https://imgur.com/a/ru5KZAE). \n\nAfter spreading so much dangerous misinformation, it's hard to see how Matt Thompson and David Callahan manage to sleep at night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1.

        "text": "Scientist in New Zealand believe they have solved this ongoing mystery. The belief now is that Alexander very likely perished from an autoimmune disease that quickly led to the failing of his body from the inside out. The findings and journals have been published in the Ancient History Bulletin.\n\nAt the time of Alexander’s death, medical doctors didn’t use a person’s pulse to determine if they were still indeed alive. Alexander’s breathing would have been very minimal due to his paralysis which is why him still being alive was missed. They just couldn’t see that he was still breathing.\n\nDr. Kathryn Hall writes, “in addition to high fever and severe abdominal pain, Alexander developed a progressive, symmetrical, increasing paralysis during his many days of illness. Yet he remained mentally lucid to the end. Scientists have determined that his symptoms are consistent with the rare Guillain – Barré syndrome. This is a disease in which the patient’s immune system “attacks” the healthy cells of the nervous system, resulting in gradual paralysis. In many cases, the body is so severely paralyzed that it no longer responds to external stimuli”\n\nThe experts who examined him probably believed that he was dead. He was unresponsive, he appeared to be completely unconscious, and he was not breathing. According to the team of New Zealander researcher and scholars, Alexander the Great was buried alive and died of asphyxiation a few days later. This explains the six-day delay in the decomposition of his body.\n\nSource: https://thechroniclesofhistory.com/2023/01/02/ancient-history-alexander-the-great-may-have-been-buried-alive/",

Because humans like cool and impressive things?

        "title": "No, average human life expectancy in the past was not \"60-70 years if you discount infant mortality\"",
        "author": "EquivalentInflation",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/zzy2bh/no_average_human_life_expectancy_in_the_past_was/",
        "text": "This particular piece of bad history is extra tricksy, because it arose from correcting *another* piece of bad history: the idea that historical people all just kinda dropped dead at thirty. However, people ended up overcorrecting, causing the frequent claims that \"If you discount infant mortality, people in ancient times usually ended up living to 60-70 years\". Some of the more bold estimates say that the average was 70-80, but still, the idea remains: people back then usually lived lives that would be considered relatively old by us, and the reason people don't realize that is because all those dead babies skew the curve.\n\nCoincidentally, a number of the people repeating this mistaken belief tend to be those who sell medicine or diets talking about how healthy our ancestors were, how all these \"vaccines\" and processed foods are destroying society, and how you too can live as long as a Russian serf in 1540 by buying their book. One example of this claim comes from noted purveyor of bad history [Ancient Origins](https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-evolution-human-origins/life-expectancy-myth-and-why-many-ancient-humans-lived-long-077889), but it extends far beyond them, especially online and on Reddit. There's even [a post on this very sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/g6az75/for_the_last_time_ancient_humans_didnt_drop_dead/) repeating the claim (which, funny enough, lacks any source for the age range).\n\nI want to make it very clear what I am debunking here: Yes, infant mortality absolutely has an impact on life expectancy statistics, which created a false narrative that people died very young. But the idea that people who survived infancy lived lives that were barely shorter than our own is utterly false. The life expectancy of the United States *today* is 77.2 years, Ancient Sumerians definitely weren't averaging around the same.\n\n\\---\n\n**Terminology**\n\nBefore beginning, it's important to clarify the difference between lifespan and average lifespan (or life expectancy). *Average* lifespan/life expectancy is an average of all people in order to determine how long most lived. It can be calculated at certain ages (eg, life expectancy at ten ignores all people who died before age ten, and calculates the average of people who had already lived that long). Lifespan on its own is how long an individual person can live, so long as they're not shot, stabbed, burned alive, eaten by wolves, infested by the plague... you get the picture. It's about the physical capabilities of the human body, and how long it can possibly keep working, often estimated to be have a hard limit around 125.\n\nAverage lifespan is a matter of history, lifespan is a matter of biology. When people say \"historical people had the same lifespan as us\", they're saying that the percentage of humans who manage to hit maximum age have reached around the same age -- NOT that the percentage of people doing so remained the same.\n\nWith that set aside, let's dive right into the bad history.\n\n\\---\n\n**Statistics**\n\nThe first, and most blatantly suspicious thing about this claim is that it always pops up with the name numbers and term: 60-70 (occasionally 70-80) and \"ancient people\" (or sometimes \"historical people\"). The obvious problem is that \"ancient people\" has no actual definition, and is about the vaguest possible term. Are we talking about the Roman Empire? Pre-colonial Mesoamerica? Meiji-era Japan? What is \"ancient\"? Regardless of your thoughts, I think we can agree it's laughably ridiculous to act as if in *every* ancient society across the globe for the past few millennia, all life expectancies have remained within the same ten year window, regardless of how common war or disease was. The Spanish Flu alone dropped average life expectancies in Europe by a full *decade*.\n\nSo, let's look at some of the actual statistics behind this. [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/its-not-just-about-child-mortality-life-expectancy-improved-at-all-ages) has an excellent article on this myth by Max Roser, drawing statistics on birth and death rates from reputable sources from across the world. He breaks down the myth in detail\n\n&gt;It’s often argued that life expectancy across the world has only increased because child mortality has fallen. If this were true, this would mean that we’ve become much better at preventing young children from dying, but have achieved nothing to improve the survival of older children, adolescents and adults. Once past childhood, people would be expected to enjoy the same length of life as they did centuries ago.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This, as we will see in the data below, is untrue. Life expectancy has increased at all ages. The average person can expect to live a longer life than in the past, irrespective of what age they are.\n\nRoser goes on to show that, in England and Wales, in 1841, the life expectancy at birth was 41.6 years. This [graph](https://imgur.com/a/5HAmFph) from the above article goes on to show the life expectancy starting at various ages. If the claim about infant mortality is true, we'd expect to see life expectancy skyrocket upwards to 70 after someone had survived infancy. While it absolutely increases, the change is nowhere near as massive as people pretend, and it is in nowhere near the region of 70 years. At age one, life expectancy is up to 48.2. If you make it to five, the cutoff point for child mortality, it bumps up again to 55.2. At ten, a small increase to 57.6. Your average life expectancy would not reach seventy until you had already survived to fifty. At which point, people are essentially arguing \"They lived longer if they didn't die\". Which is technically true, but... come on. Even if you just go with the minimum year in that range, 60, you'd still have to be 20 years old to reliably reach that point. That goes far beyond just infant mortality.\n\nAnd remember, this wasn't some far flung era, this was one of the most prosperous nations in Europe in 1841. They were well past the Scientific Revolution, and were living in an age with far better medicine than before. The first vaccine had been discovered by Edward Jenner in 1796, and vaccination and inoculation was already common by this point, with smallpox vaccines being mandatory [just a few years later](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/victorian-health-reform/). People at the time were noting that the death rate had dropped significantly, and populations were rising.\n\n[This interactive global map](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy#a-comparative-perspective-life-expectancy-at-the-age-of-15) shows this clearly (as well as just being fun to mess around with). It takes the average life expectancy of people who had already survived to fifteen across time, as far back as reliable records go. In many countries, even those considered developed like France, they were *just* breaking sixty by the 1940s. The aftermath of WWII certainly impacted that, but the trend continued before the war.\n\nSo, we've shown that this was false for nations in the mid 1800s. But who knows? Maybe the super duper ancients had some mystery to living long that we forgot. Let's look back at some *real* \"ancients\", the one every terrible armchair historian jumps to when they hear that word: Rome. At the age of ten, their estimated life expectancy tended to be 45-50 years. This figure remained relatively consistent throughout both Republic and Empire (obviously with various dips around the times of significant wars and disease outbreaks, as well as variations by location). Notably, this figure is also largely based on the detailed accounts of the *patrician* class. This wasn't just the scum of the gutter, these were the wives of senators, of consuls, even of emperors. Only around 7% of their population would have been over the age of 60, while half was below 25.\n\nSources:\n\nImperial Women Within the Imperial Family, Mary Taliaferro Boatwright, p. 87.\n\nRoman Social History: A Sourcebook, Parkin and Pomeroy, pg. 44-45\n\nPart of the reason many people believe that Romans lived so long is that they take their data from tombs and epigraphs. To put it mildly, that is a *terrible* way of measuring lifespan, which fails to take into account a number of factors, and wildly skews the data. Romans had vastly different funeral practices depending on age, meaning that we have far fewer tombstones from middle aged men, only the elderly (and some from the very young). Not to mention, they *lied*. A lot. The number of graves in Roman Africa claiming the man buried there lived for over 100 years is statistically impossible. One source stated that ages from Roman epitaphs \"mostly demographically impossible and always highly improbable\". We even have concrete proof that one man, Titus Flavius Pudens Maximianus died at age 87, but ordered his death recorded as 100. Headstones and epitaphs don't measure which Romans died, they measure which Romans were *commemorated*. If we take them as fact, we'd have to look at the massive disparity by sex, and conclude that there are thousands of Roman women who just never died, and are still running around today.\n\nSource: Demography and Roman Society, Tim Parkin, pg. 7-24.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, it's easy to discount Rome. After all, they *were* notable for being warlike and having a higher rate of mortality than many others, as well as having less certain records. Instead, let's look at Medieval Europe, across a long timespan. Statistician H.O. Lancaster looked across multiple eras, specifically studying male nobles who had already reached the age of 21.\n\n&gt;1200-1300 Life expectancy: 43 years  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1300-1400 Life expectancy: 24 years  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1400-1500 Life expectancy: 48 years  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1500-1550 Life expectancy: 50 years  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1550-1600 Life expectancy: 47 years  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1600-1650 Life expectancy: 43 years  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1650-1700 Life expectancy: 41 years  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1700-1745 Life expectancy: 43 years  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(The drop during the 1300s was the Black Plague, which obviously had a major effect).\n\nOnce again: these men weren't peasants or serfs, they were elite noblemen. While Lancaster notes that they were slightly more likely to die in battle than most men of the era, this table omits \"those who had died by accidents, violence, poison, or in battle\". They also had little to no risk of starvation in famine, better access to medicine (the Middle Ages weren't *great*, but medicine wasn't *quite* as stupid as the memes portray it), as well as not having to undergo daily back breaking labor.\n\nThis table is about as generous as possible, excluding several early causes of death, and only focusing on the\n\nSource:\n\nExpectations of Human Longevity, H.O. Lancaster, pg. 8.\n\n\\---\n\n**Survivorship bias**\n\nThere's the famous story about the [WWII plane with bullet holes](https://www.deanyeong.com/article/survivorship-bias), which applies here too. Historians, both amateur and casual have judged an era's lifespan by the specific births and deaths of various individuals, such as JP Griffin's [table](https://imgur.com/a/h5Gp62B) (From \"Changing Life Expectancy Throughout History\"). People then see those tables, and take away the fact that ancient people lived for quite a long time. The issue is that they're citing very *important* people, especially roles that benefitted from age. Of course famous Italian painters lived longer, because no one bothered to record the death of all the shitty, poorly known painters. Their fame benefitted from having a far longer career, and their fame is why we still have specific dates for them today. While it was still possible for an artist who died young to achieve fame, it was much less likely. Even setting that aside, all of the people he picked were significant figures in society, not reflective of the average person. The sample size Griffin was using was *incredibly* small, and cannot be considered an accurate picture of those societies.\n\nSimilarly, JD Montagu [wrote an article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1294277/?page=1) about lifespans of Greeks and Romans, arguing they tended to live almost exactly the same amount of time as us (discounting infant mortality). In order to get this number, he discounted all violent deaths, and used 298 figures with known dates of birth and death. First off, ignoring the instances of violence skewed the figure significantly, cutting out 99 potential figures. And second, once again, we have such detailed ages on them because they were important men in Roman society. There were age restrictions on many positions of power, and older men had built up the wealth and connections needed. \"How long did this wealthy consul live\" doesn't tell us anything about how long an average slave lived. Even ignoring all those issues, 298 men over the course of centuries is nowhere close to a large enough sample size to make an accurate statement on age in their society.\n\n(Coincidentally, both Griffin and Montagu used only men for their research, making sure that they wouldn't have to deal with that pesky issue of childbirth messing up their numbers).\n\nNow, neither of these articles were *entirely* bad history. In proper context, they can be useful for determining human lifespan, showing that people were biologically capable of reaching these ages. But when people take them out of that context, and cite them as representative of *everyone* at the time, it becomes seriously misleading.\n\nThis is a common issue across all history, even researchers who are trying to be honest and accurate: the people whose ages we have the most information about tend to be wealthier or more significant than the average person. As such, they can better afford food, medicine, shelter... as well as having documentation of their life and death. Roman elites were obsessed with tracking their and those of their ancestors, they were less concerned about noting down the exact date of death for slave #2987 who got crushed by a block of marble.\n\nBecause of all that, it's important to remember that most data on historical life expectancies, especially as you go further back, will skew higher than it actually was. This effect is magnified by things like tombstones, as mentioned previously. So even when you're looking at a life expectancy we'd consider low, the reality for many people of the era was likely worse.\n\n\\---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSo yes, the idea that people in the past were living almost as long as us if you discount infant mortality is utter bunk. Even if you're generous, and discount all of child mortality, you're still not reaching lifespans anywhere close to modern ones.\n\nYes, public health and sanitation, along with modern medicine, caused infant mortality to have a shocking drop. But those advancements also benefited adults as well. Infection was one of the biggest causes of death, which we have significantly reduced with brilliant new technology like \"soap\" and \"cleaning your medical equipment\". Not to mention that we have far greater access to food and comparatively fewer instances of violence and warfare.\n\nThere's a desire to be correct about things, specifically things that other people don't know. That's why this sub exists, because it feels *good* to be smarter. However, that desire can be dangerous. When there's a correction for a common myth, people start repeating that \"correction\" because they enjoy the idea that they know more than all the unwashed masses. The problem is that those people are just doing the same exact thing -- repeating and spreading a piece of bad history. Even worse, since it's correcting previous history, and it sounds vaguely reasonable, people are more inclined to accept it without question.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n[https://ourworldindata.org/its-not-just-about-child-mortality-life-expectancy-improved-at-all-ages](https://ourworldindata.org/its-not-just-about-child-mortality-life-expectancy-improved-at-all-ages)\n\n[https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/victorian-health-reform/](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/victorian-health-reform/)\n\nImperial Women Within the Imperial Family, Mary Taliaferro Boatwright, p. 87.\n\nRoman Social History: A Sourcebook, Parkin and Pomeroy, pg. 44-45\n\nDemography and Roman Society, Tim Parkin, pg. 7-24.\n\nExpectations of Human Longevity, H.O.
