This is my first post on Reddit so excuse me if I make some mistakes (I\u2019m still learning how Reddit works LOL).\n\nI would like to start saying:\n1. My favourite trope EVER is ENEMIES TO LOVERS (usually with high sexual tension)\n2. I'm a bit picky when it comes to stories, and sometimes I don't quite see what everyone else sees (and vice-versa). I like the characters to be realistic, genuine and authentic, with just the right amount of sass. Sometimes just a bad dialogue or an unrealistic scene\/situation that seems exaggerated is enough to make me lose interested in the audiobook. \n\nI was looking for a fun and sexy story and this audiobook has seriously kept me hooked from beginning to end. \nNot only is the narration top-notch (shoutout to the voice actress for bringing these characters to life), but the story itself is so well written, engaging and addictive! \nI\u2019m talking about finishing a 12 hours audiobook in 2 days staying up way too late kind of addicted. (luckily it was during the weekend LOL).\n\nThe book is just so sexy and fun, the two main characters are just amazing, and their sexual tension is *chef kiss*.\n\nAnd let me tell you, when I was about two hours away from finishing, I suddenly realized that the cover of the audiobook was actually the cover of the movie that was released in 2021. \nWHAT?? I finished the audiobook, and then immediately watched the movie (of course).\nI was squealing like a school girl the whole time: the actors brought the characters to life in such an incredible way, and it was so fun to see everything play out on the screen.\n\nThe first half of the movie closely follows the book, which was exciting to see!\nHowever, they made some significant changes to the story in the second half that left me feeling a bit disappointed. Important details were altered, and the story felt slightly different.\nMoreover the steamy scenes were not at all comparable with the audiobook (which is understandable).\n\nOverall, I did enjoy the movie, especially after falling in love with the audiobook and imagining the characters in my head. The actors were spot on, and it was fun to see they were exactly as I imagined them in my head.\nSo, if you're a fan of the book, definitely give the movie a watch and judge for yourself. \n\nIf you're looking for a steamy, enemies-to-lovers romance that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this audiobook definitely delivers.\n\nThe book is { The hating game } by Sally Thorne. \n\nI would like to know your opinion and if you have similar audiobooks to recommend, I\u2019m all ears!","upvote_ratio":0.2,"created_utc":1678737834.0},{"title":"At what point is book preservation vs piracy","author":"DigitalGameArtist","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/audiobooks\/comments\/11pgre6\/at_what_point_is_book_preservation_vs_piracy\/","text":"I digitized a book that only had one run in the early 90s.

It\u2019s about a 20 year old woman who\u2019s home from college due to her chronic illness. She joins a discord server for people who also have a chronic illness and, without getting into spoilers, one of the member\u2019s chronic illness is lycanthropy, that is, she\u2019s a werewolf. \n\nMost stories about werewolves tend to either be fantasy or horror. Werewolves tend to be this big scary monster that the protagonist either has to fight or escape from. The general gist is that werewolves are big, scary, and bad. I don\u2019t like that. \n\nI really like O\u2019Neal\u2019s take on the genre, the werewolf is just a regular (and insanely reliable) person who\u2019s just trying to live life with a condition that gets them into some weird situations. The story almost reads like a slice of life, tho the stakes do get a bit higher. My only complaint is that I\u2019d much rather hear the story from the werewolf\u2019s perspective. I want to get to know what it\u2019s like to be a werewolf, and not just a werewolf\u2019s best friend. \n\nAnyone have any suggestions for a modern day story with a relatable werewolf protagonist? \n\nAlso, I\u2019m a long haul trucker so a 12 hour audio book will last me a little over a day, so the longer the better.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1678662136.0},{"title":"What\u2019s a better non-pirated audiobook app?","author":"Southernish_History","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/audiobooks\/comments\/11phzaw\/whats_a_better_nonpirated_audiobook_app\/","text":"I\u2019m a truck driver and listen to audiobooks consistently.

The noises she had become accustomed to hearing were gone, as though all life had been sucked out of the world. The deafening silence only proved to unnerve her and set her even further on edge. She was waiting for the boogeyman.

I respect and appreciate both of them as they help pioneer and establish the cyberpunk world aesthetics and atmosphere of science fiction.  I can see how they were huge precursors to other works such as Blade Runner (of course, adapted from DADOES), The Matrix, and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, to say a few.\n\nThat being said, neither books will likely make my top favorite book list this year.  I found DADOES to be underwhelming; you'd really need an open mind and wide imagination to immerse into that cyberpunk world; I commend those who were able to do so back around when the book was first published.  Maybe I was spoiled from having watched Blade Runner and 2045 beforehand, so I kept picturing Harrison Ford when following Rick Deckard's exploits.  I share similar sentiments with Neuromancer; however I doubt I'm the only one who found it very confusing and hard to follow.  Other readers have recommended to accept it as what it is and just enjoy the ride.  Some described it as  a \"stream of consciousness\" storytelling.  The plots, concepts, and theme were compelling, maybe even unique for its time.  However, I would have appreciated it more if it was told more clearly in a way that was easier to connect.  If Wikipedia and academic summary websites did not exist, I don't know what I'd do.  At least it's nice to know that I had a general idea of what's going on and these websites confirmed it.  \n\nI do have several questions.  Are most of the books by both of these authors like this?

I've recommended a few retailers in these kinds of threads that have better terms, like Chirp, Audiobooks.com, Kobo, among others.\n\nLittle by little, I'm starting to notice authors offering their books direct and really pushing it.\n\nI'm actually one of these authors. I'm really trying to focus on direct audiobook sales, mainly because Audible pays us so little. If you're non-exclusive like me, you get about 15% of each sale. Selling direct I can keep 100% minus some minor transaction fees. So basically one sale direct is like six sales on Audible (assuming the same price).\n\nI know I can never beat Audible as far as convenience, so I won't even try. I'm just trying to figure out what people's sticking points are when buying direct from authors, and how I can make the process as seamless as possible.\n\nSo would you buy direct from the author if:\n\n1. It required you to enter payment info and give an author your email (this is required to send the audiobook code directly to the reader in an automated and hands off way).\n2. If it required you to download a new app you've never heard of (BookFunnel) to play the audiobooks. Maybe you've heard of BookFunnel before, but a lot of readers haven't.\n3. It would be 50% cheaper than a credit (let's say $7.50 a book, maybe as low as $5 a book if you bought the entire series in one go). Imagine it's an author you've never heard of before, but they write in a genre you're interested in. Obviously, if someone like Sanderson were to do this he'd have no issues because of his name recognition and trust. Any other author would have to find some way to establish that trust in a way that wasn't too wordy or try-hard.\n\nAs you can see, there are a lot of hurdles to authors taking power into their own hands. It's hard to communicate to the reader, especially readers who have never heard of you before. Every little thing you ask a reader to do that's different\/takes time,  adds friction to the process and makes a direct sale less likely to happen, especially when Audible offers instant convenience.\n\nI ask all this because I'm just trying to understand how readers think. I've been an author for so long that it's difficult to put my reader hat on sometimes. There are probably other issues I haven't even thought of.\n\nSo, what do you think?

In Libby one can notify interest in a title: does that mean one will automatically be put into the queue when\/if your library obtains the title, or will you just get a notification and have to manually place a hold?  The current system in Overdrive is probably not perfect (and my library restricted the number of recommendations one could do likely to limit the number of people in a title queue once a title was obtained), but it seems like when using Libby there will be a free-for-all once your library obtains a title to get into the hold queue as opposed to being earliest to recommend it which works well with Overdrive.  \n\nI\u2019m really bummed to see the superior navigation of Overdrive go away for the inferior search and navigation that Libby has and not looking forward to that.  Libby is great for eBook & Audiobook consumption, but search and title management are so much better in Overdrive.  \n\nhttps:\/\/resources.overdrive.com\/libby-faqs\/","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1677610561.0},{"title":"Do you know any authors with a free audiobook available to introduce their other work?","author":"JensonVDP","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/audiobooks\/comments\/11e6re2\/do_you_know_any_authors_with_a_free_audiobook\/","text":"I'm looking for authors who have an audiobook available for free to get listeners hooked to their content.\n\n\nRest is just for context:\n\nI'm a starting youtuber showing audiobooks in the public domain, but I would love to start promoting authors and narrators that are still alive and would benefit from this!\n\nI already found a few authors who agreed to put a book on my channel Youtube channel.

I've always been a writer, but back in January 2020, just before the Great Pandemic, I started creating YouTube videos for my original book chapters. Because I am a creative-type, I couldn't help myself. I had to act out the dialogue, do music placement and sound effects, and try to create an audio sound scape. This, I've found, put me in a weird category. Because Audiobooks don't do soundscapes - they just read the book. Audio drama usually doesn't mean a drama of a book-read, with narration. Its a script meant to explain the story through sound and dialogue.\n\nSo therefore, my question today my fellow sojourners of this nascent field, is this: Do you think there should be a clear delineation of audio drama versus audiobooks?

But not only is it a solid deconstruction of the *isekai* (elseworld) trope waaaay too popular in Japanese media right now (horrifying reasons it's a \"game like world\" with stats and skills and spells), it's also quite well plotted and fun to read. ANY story where the 'final battle' isn't between some bog-standard Good and Evil but between two powerful beings who are both right, *but disagree about which is the best right*... Pretty good stuff.\n\nPlus, the audiobook version is read by Caitlyn Kelly, who has a *supreme* range. Chef's kiss. \n\nThe problem is there's a \"spell\" that lets a character look at someone's stat block. On (literal) paper, it's *fine*; a quick glance over a page-sized stat block isn't all that important. But every time it happens in the audiobook it drags the story straight to a *halt*. Plus, the character will *always* \\- always! - summarize anything important after the spell, like \"His Dark Resistance *spells* trouble for me!\" \n\nI just finished editing the third book, and out of a 8.5 hour runtime, the Appraisal spell accounts for an entire *hour* of its length. In the second and fourth, it's at similar proportions, though thankfully it stops being so annoying after book 5 and eventually disappears. \n\nBut it's got me thinking about what else could be abridged with nothing of value lost from various audiobooks. Would removing most of Tom Bombadil's (Tom Bombadillo's!) scenes from Fellowship of the Ring deprive the average reader of nothing, or am I in a minority that skips straight from the Old Forest to the Barrow-Downs? \n\nAre there any audiobooks you can think of which would justify a... bit... of trimming?

I reread 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Ender's Game, Ender's Shadow, To Kill A Mockingbird, and The House of the Scorpion.  I can see why these series are highly regarded for their characters, plot, worldbuilding, emotional engagement, and themes.  The funny thing is, rereading them was literally like reading it for the first time.  Perhaps when I read these books in the past, I was not at a point in my life to fully understand and appreciate them.  I appreciate more aspects of what the book has to offer when watching it again.  I've even genuinely enjoyed reading that are highly regarded for the first time, like the first 3 Dune books, all 5 currently released Red Rising books, Flowers For Algernon, Cory Doctorow's Little Brother series, Emma, Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre, Marie Lu's Legend series, I'm Glad My Mom Died, Homegoing, Brave New World, Lord of the Flies, the Overlord series, the first 3 Girl With The Dragon Tattoo books, The Handmaid's Tale, Being Mortal, and Neverwhere to name a few.  I'm currently reading the Prydain Chronicles and The Bartimaeus Trilogy.\n\nAfter a while, the stories, themes, characters, and plots start to blend.  I genuinely enjoy most of what I read and am engaged when I read them.  However, afterwards, I don't always remember most of the characters names or plot points.  I have a general idea of what happens, how it ends, and how certain characters relate to one another.  And at least I remember what I like and don't like and why it stood out to me.\n\nMy questions are: Why is this the case? Am I not used to the depth of these series or am consuming them too fast?  I don't even binge; I give a book series 1 or 2 books at a time at most.  Or am I consuming too many books and series? Does anyone else read books like this?  How can I better read books in a way that allows me to reflect, appreciate, and remember as many things as the series has to offer?  Is it better to space out the watching and take more breaks in between?  Is it more helpful to engage in discussions (online or real life) as I go through them?  How can it be that you've consumed something in the past, genuinely liked it, but not remember much about it when you consume it once again?","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1676006585.0},{"title":"Help me find my next Audiobook!","author":"Ok-Bee-1910","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/audiobooks\/comments\/10y9c9n\/help_me_find_my_next_audiobook\/","text":"I love audiobooks, but I do tend to have a hard time at finding one that sucks me in.

Audible is where my 600-audiobook-collection and all of my credits currently live, and so that is where I am seeking further books. I've hit the point where most of my searches for books on Goodreads and rec lists give me books I've already read or have deeply mixed reviews - but I've also found that all my favorite recs have always come from actual people! Sometimes a 3-star book for the masses is a 5-star book for the right person, you know? so I'm hoping if I put myself out here some of y'all will hit me with the books you adore with an evangelical zeal, and draw me into your faves.   \n\n\nI'm looking for adult MLM fantasy with a male main or POV character who DOESN'T suffer and die terribly - gay or bi, cis or trans, I don't care. Magic preferred, but I'll take swords instead.\n\n  \n**I DO care about, and award bonus points for:** \n\n>Dragons. POLITICAL INTRIGUE. Thieves. Pirates! Talented conmen. Delightfully internally consistent magic systems. Expansive world building. Nonbinary inclusive world building. Disability inclusive worldbuilding. Flirty gays and bisexuals of any gender. Character driven plot. Dashing swordsmen. Dashing swordsWOMEN. Phantom thieves. Non-European fantasy settings. Character driven plots. Witty dialogue. Organized crime. Fake married or there's-only-one-bed romance tropes.\n\nA preference for faux period fantasy in it's own non-earth world, but y'know, I'll take what I can get. I'm not particularly interested in modern urban fantasy, but I'll put it on the maybe list if it checks enough other boxes.\n\nI will *not* read any more coming-of-age flavored young adult fantasy, no  matter how good it is. I *will* read a queer female POV book if it's got enough other good stuff.\n\nI've read as much straight up romance as I have fantasy - I don't mind either way if a book is fantasy flavored romance, or a fantasy book with incidentally queer MCs. I just prefer to know which is which before I get started. \n\nAs a campy flamboyant gay man, I am not insulted by (non-malicious) depictions of campy flamboyant gay men, and sometimes characters that strike others as stereotypical just strike me as accurate.\n\n**These are my favorite things:**\n\n* Heralds of Valdemar (Mercedes Lackey)\n* Realm of the Elderlings (Robin Hobb)\n* Rook & Rose (M.A. Carrick)\n* Riverside (Ellen Kushner)\n* Captive Prince (C.S. Pacat)\n* Off topic, not queer: Myth Adventures series (Robert Asprin) \n* Off topic, not queer or adult: Artemis Fowl, first three books (Eoin Colfer) \n* Off topic, not books: Dragon Age video games, One Piece manga, and other nerdy fantasy epics.\n\n**And these are things I've listened to recently and ticked boxes I enjoyed:**\n\n* The God-King Chronicles (Mike Brooks - Marin & Alazar now own my soul)\n* The Fire's Stone (Tanya Huff)\n* The first few Nightrunner books (Lynn Flewelling) before they got too torture-porn.\n* The Riyria Chronicles (Michael J Sullivan)\n* A Taste of Gold and Iron (Alexandra Rowland - really loved this, actually)\n* The High King's Golden Tongue, Tournament of Losers (Megan Derr - kind of short and very  predictable, but still fun)\n\n**For length:** I like long books\/series! Short is fine, but I'm perfectly willing to invest myself in ten thousand pages of adventures.\n\n**For readers:** I was absolutely stunned impressed by Nikki Massoud's reading of The Mask of Mirrors. And Casey Jones voice in A Taste of Gold and Iron was smooth as chocolate and a joy to listen to.\n\n\\---\n\nIs this rec request both too long and deeply self indulgent? Absolutely!

First of all, the book is completely fascinating. It's about a pair of twins, one who's good at language, one who's good at math, and the alchemist who created them. 5 stars, amazing book.\n\nBut Benson's narration of this book is absolutely god tier. There are places in the book where she uses unusually perfect diction to get across a mood. Her character voices are top notch. She makes the characters feel so complete and real. And she even makes the \"he says, she says\" bits sound like a part of the narrative. It's really subtle, but usually those things kind of feel invisible when most narrators do them. Which I understand, normally that's what you'd want. But Amber makes those things feel important somehow. \n\nThe only other book I've heard narrated by Benson is Lock In, by John Scalzi. I was impressed with Benson in that book, but I'm blown away by her in this one.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674577705.0},{"title":"What are your favourite short audiobooks?","author":"readlover12","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/audiobooks\/comments\/10kg3gk\/what_are_your_favourite_short_audiobooks\/","text":"I'm new in the field and looking for advices.\n\nEvey genre allowed","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674594005.0},{"title":"Using audiobook platforms through Alexa","author":"HandelDew","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/audiobooks\/comments\/10kk0e3\/using_audiobook_platforms_through_alexa\/","text":"I like to listen to audiobooks from digital library collections and public domain collections.\n\nThis means using Libby, Hoopla, and LibriVox.\n\nI would really like to do this through my Alexa, as it\u2019s convenient and I don\u2019t want to get sucked in to spending more time looking at screens. \n\nOverdrive, the e-library platform that Libby replaced, had an Alexa skill associated with it.

TTS adventure","author":"Presidentofsleep","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/audiobooks\/comments\/109ax0l\/brandon_sanderson_has_made_me_search_for\/","text":"So with Sanderson's recent refusal to put his new books on Audible it really opened my eyes to what's going on there with how much they pay authors.  I wasn't going to not listen to his books so I began searching for alternatives.  I've also been tangentially aware of websites such as royalroad where budding authors can post new stories.  I really don't have time to read as much as I would like to and mainly listen to books while at work, driving, or doing chores around the house.\n\nSo I decided to try to figure out TTS (text to speech) since one of the things mentioned on Sandersons post was about speechify.  I've never really messed around with these programs but I've learned a lot over the last several days.  Speechify is not great.  They have a fair selection of voice but they still sound very robotic to me and I found myself just not retaining what was read to me even with their premium voices.  The edge browser has a really good, free TTS function but I was looking for something for IOS so I could listen on the go.  The native IOS TTS is better when you install the enhanced voices which you can do via General settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voices.  You can then have it read whatever you import to your Ibooks app via google drive or whatever but this was still too robotic sounding for me.  I then tried an app called NaturalReader.  Wow.  This app is amazing, though it does have a subscription fee.  But, the voices sound much less robotic than any other app I've tried.  Highly recomend.  Also if you're trying to convert books to pdf check out the app calibre, with an addon called fanficfare you can even pull books from those afore mentioned websites like royalroad.  \n\n\nI'm not associated with the naturalreader app in anyway.  Just wanted to share my story to hopefully spread the knowledge on how to consume more books via your ears vs eyes.

As my teacher's saying, the best way to learn an accent is to imitate the way they narrated. So, I bought *Get Rid of Your Accent* series first on Audible and learned some basic tips. Currently I have three books to follow:\n\n* *The curious incident of the dog in the night*, narrated by Ben Tibber;\n\nThis book is very easy to understand. The reading speed of narration is slow and perfect for me, so it is my very first choice. The problem is that it was narrated by a kid, but i'm a grown-up man. Is that not a good thing to imitate? I'm not sure.\n\n* *Watching the English: The International Bestseller Revised and Updated*, narrated by Joan Walker;\n\nI chose this one because Joan Walker is also a main narrator in *Get Rid of Your Accent* and this is one of her non-fiction books. I also have 2 or 3 her fiction books.\n\n* *Breaking News*, narrated by Samuel West.\n\nOh, I just love Samuel West's voice after watching several his movies. I bought his audibooks for kids and teens at first, *such as grimm tales for young and old*, then a few fictions, and...this one, I thought non-fiction book is a better choice for learning. But all his audiobooks are incredibly fast to follow and to imitate.\n\nI need some advices from natives. Those books and narrators above are only my choices without experience. I think the reading speed of narration is the vital key for me, but I'm not trying to keep myself in a comfort zone, I know that is not good for learning. So, are these books good choices? Could you recommend some more books or narrators? And any other tips for me?\n\nI know someone gonna say Stephen Fry, I listened a few books of his, a very good narrator indeed, but I kinda feel I need books less dramatic. Btw, Obi-wan in The Clone Wars voiced by James Arnold Taylor fascinates me so much, but that is not the way we speak in real world, right? Right? Can I learn this?

(a series will allow you to fudge that a bit, lol)\n\nFor me it was:\n\n**1. Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir, Narrated by Ray Porter**\n* Everyone loves this book for good reason, engaging writing and characters coupled with amazing narration and sound design.  It just makes you happy happy happy!\n\n**2. Murderbot Diaries Series by Martha Wells, Narrated by Kevin Free**\n* Martha Wells writes so well, I'm glad I discovered her this year.  Murderbot is a relatable, reluctant hero with wit, sarcasm, and realistic deficiencies.  Kevin Free's narration is perfect for Murderbot, I can't imagine another voice.  I consumed all 7 books (6 novellas and 1 novel) and enjoyed all, but Network Effect was my favorite as the added length meant added enjoyment.\n\n**3. Empire of the Summer Moon by S. C. Gwynne, Narrated by David Drummond**\n* Pulitzer Prize finalist for a reason, the writing is great and informative about \"The Rise and Fall of the Comanche Empire\".  No punches pulled here, sometimes this book is brutal!  I came away from it informed about a piece of history that was glossed over at best for me in the past and have a new appreciation for the events.  Not a light read, but a worthy one.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1672854871.0},{"title":"I can\u2019t see","author":"gajetgrl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/audiobooks\/comments\/103oico\/i_cant_see\/","text":"any audiobooks on Chirp - when I go to the app I don\u2019t see a \u201cbrowse\u201d or pictures of titles, how do I get to see what\u2019s available?","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1672890091.0},{"title":"Books I Listened To 2022","author":"jumpoffjosh","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/audiobooks\/comments\/10355m9\/books_i_listened_to_2022\/","text":"Hello all! I hope you all had a great year. I ran into a little bit of a rut midway through the year and just re-listened to all the Harry Potter books, so my numbers are a little low this year. I found some of these books to be real bore's and others I slammed through in a day. So without further adieu...\n\n[**Appleseed** - *Matt Bell*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/Appleseed-Audiobook\/0063040174?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=0W9003WYEBE7ENRND8YB) Started the year with this one, and while it received a lot of positive reviews, I just never could get into it. Felt a little heavy handed to me. Could've just been wrong time of year to be listening to it too.\n\n[**John Tyler, The Accidental President** - *Edward P. Crapol*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/John-Tyler-the-Accidental-President-Audiobook\/1515947750?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=PTRJ2WE1P7BH2DP5P6A5) Continuing my journey of a biography of every US President brings me to the first VP to be lifted to President. In the fifth grade we were all assigned presidents to do a quick biography of and John Tyler was who was assigned to me. So I've always had this weird soft spot for him. Always knew the Tippecanoe and Tyler Too ticket. Now, in adulthood, he kind of stinks. I feel as though he meant well, but was either a victim of the times or just didn't have the fortitude to do anything about it. Either way, an enjoyable listen, one of the better biographies and didn't feel like a slog to get through.\n\n[**A Lie Someone Told You About Yourself** - *Peter Ho Davies*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/A-Lie-Someone-Told-You-About-Yourself-Audiobook\/0358395046?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=WYKVETWR6TRPAZZ26QDD) This was a recommendation from a friend, and now I think that friend doesn't like me. It's a good book, but boy does it make you get introspective. Especially as a husband with a child, it's difficult to not put yourself in the protagonist shoes and ask yourself the same questions. I enjoyed it, certainly, but it took something out of me.\n\n[**The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue** - *V.E. Schwab*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/The-Invisible-Life-of-Addie-LaRue-Audiobook\/125077795X?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=WYKVETWR6TRPAZZ26QDD) This was a buzzy book last year. Is it a revelation? No. Did it make me feel things? No. But, it was fun. I don't know how else to describe it. It was an interesting premise, not a great follow-through, but still listened to it pretty quick. An incredible narrator in Julia Whelan though. Really just a perfect voice to listen to. It's worth a listen. \n\n[**Zero Fail: The Rise and Fall of The Secret Service** - *Carol Leonnig*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/Zero-Fail-Audiobook\/0593412109?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=EF73BV7TKXMTTH7VVJFQ) A very interesting listen about the Secret Service, the \"silent\" protectors of the government have quite a few skeletons in their closet. It's a great book for history buffs as it goes through the inception of the service to date and touches on all the important parts of history. If you like American history books, you'll like this.\n\n[**Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland** - *Patrick Radden Keefe*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/Say-Nothing-Audiobook\/1984841130?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=9FK4C1S2TGSEPHXZPTQT) I loved Patrick Radden Keefe's book on the Sackler family, so I've continued to listen to all of his books. Say Nothing was not as strong as Empire of Pain, but my wife is Irish, so it was still an informative listen. I didn't really know much about the events, so it was good to learn.\n\n[**A Country of Vast Designs** - *Robert W. Merry*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/A-Country-of-Vast-Designs-Audiobook\/B003BDZHCO?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=DE9CRQK9F1MA9XKCXQ41) On to James K Polk here, a President I really didn't know much about, but he shaped a lot of how the country looks today. He had a vision and even post presidency he attempted to fulfill. If he fully has his way the US would be even larger than it is now.\n\n[**How Much of These Hills Is Gold** - *C Pam Zhang*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/How-Much-of-These-Hills-Is-Gold-Audiobook\/0593166949?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=DE9CRQK9F1MA9XKCXQ41) Another recommendation from a friend, I liked it, but I think this is around when my rut was starting to rear it's ugly head. I will say, I kept being surprised by what happened, and maybe I wasn't paying enough attention, or maybe it was supposed to catch you off guard in such a way. Obviously people like this book and it's a good look at some of the things that happened during the gold rush. \n\n[**War on Peace** - *Ronan Farrow*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/War-on-Peace-Audiobook\/B07BGHPXZY?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_B07BGHPXZY&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=XX5YBTYG2DQDPWJ6N9CP&pageLoadId=mo3KaAdKCEqvWmQ2&creativeId=4ee810cf-ac8e-4eeb-8b79-40e176d0a225) I really enjoy Ronan Farrow. His book on Weinstein was a masterpiece and he's an engaging narrator as well. This is another great work and I'd encourage everyone to listen. Another good one for American history buffs. \n\n[**In Cold Blood** - *Truman Capote*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/In-Cold-Blood-Audiobook\/B002UZJTXM?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_B002UZJTXM&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=XX5YBTYG2DQDPWJ6N9CP&pageLoadId=mo3KaAdKCEqvWmQ2&creativeId=4ee810cf-ac8e-4eeb-8b79-40e176d0a225) The definitive true crime book, it's a classic for a reason, and adding Scott Brick's narration to it makes it even better. At times it was slow, but the further into it I got, the more and more I had to listen to it. A great story for anyone who likes true crime podcasts or books or anything.\n\n[**Worst.President.Ever** - *Robert Strauss*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/Worst-President-Ever-Audiobook\/B01N2S2MZM?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_B01N2S2MZM&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=XX5YBTYG2DQDPWJ6N9CP&pageLoadId=mo3KaAdKCEqvWmQ2&creativeId=4ee810cf-ac8e-4eeb-8b79-40e176d0a225) All the way up to James Buchanan. There isn't a great selection on Audible for Taylor, Fillmore, or Pierce, so I listened to some podcasts and read some online to fill in for now. But boy oh boy is Buchanan a buffoon. Strauss painted a good picture of the man and Tom Perkins did a good job narrating. Unless you've got the same bucket list as me, you can still probably skip this one though.\n\n[**The Midnight Library** - *Matt Haig*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/The-Midnight-Library-Audiobook\/059334023X?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_059334023X&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=XX5YBTYG2DQDPWJ6N9CP&pageLoadId=mo3KaAdKCEqvWmQ2&creativeId=4ee810cf-ac8e-4eeb-8b79-40e176d0a225) Another buzzy book like Addie LaRue, The Midnight Library was on a lot of best of \"recent books\" lists. Carey Mulligan was a tremendous narrator and the premise was strong. However, at the end of it, I just wondered what the whole point was. It does invite imagination and introspection of what you'd do in the same position, but it just doesn't end with any gusto. An enjoyable read, but not a necessary one.\n\n[**A Confederacy of Dunces** - *John Kennedy Toole*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/A-Confederacy-of-Dunces-Audiobook\/B002V0KKHK?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_B002V0KKHK&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=XX5YBTYG2DQDPWJ6N9CP&pageLoadId=mo3KaAdKCEqvWmQ2&creativeId=4ee810cf-ac8e-4eeb-8b79-40e176d0a225) This was a goofy book, obviously. It took me a little bit to get into it, but eventually I was hooked on the absurdity. Ignatius J Reilly is up there with some of the all time literary fools. But in a good way! I think most people would enjoy this.\n\n[**The Force** - *Don Winslow*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/The-Force-Audiobook\/B06XCM7Y9V?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_B06XCM7Y9V&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=XX5YBTYG2DQDPWJ6N9CP&pageLoadId=mo3KaAdKCEqvWmQ2&creativeId=4ee810cf-ac8e-4eeb-8b79-40e176d0a225) I'm not sure exactly what mood I was in when I decided to listen to this one. But this is like, a \"manly man\" fantasy book. Toughest of the tough, smartest of the smart, but an every man. I don't know. Dion Graham is a great narrator, it took me a minute to realize he narrated The Circle too, which was a favorite of mine. If you need a boost of macho toughness, I guess you can listen to this.\n\n[**The Least of Us** - *Sam Quinones*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/The-Least-of-Us-Audiobook\/B09KMC9XCV?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_B09KMC9XCV&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=XX5YBTYG2DQDPWJ6N9CP&pageLoadId=mo3KaAdKCEqvWmQ2&creativeId=4ee810cf-ac8e-4eeb-8b79-40e176d0a225) I think I had just watched Dopesick (great show on Hulu, I encourage everyone to watch that) and I wanted to read even more into the world of opioids. It's just incredible how this epidemic happened and really is still happening all around us. Anyone with any interest in the subject matter should add this to the list. \n\n[**Doctors and Distillers** - *Camper English*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/Doctors-and-Distillers-Audiobook\/B09FWL2TTZ?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_B09FWL2TTZ&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=XX5YBTYG2DQDPWJ6N9CP&pageLoadId=mo3KaAdKCEqvWmQ2&creativeId=4ee810cf-ac8e-4eeb-8b79-40e176d0a225) I mean, it's a book about the health benefits throughout the ages of alcohol. Are there any? Not really. I mean, it's a disinfectant and a diuretic. But, I enjoy a beer, wine, whiskey, tequila here and there (everywhere), so I figured I'd give it a listen. It's a fine book about the history of alcohol. If that interests you, listen to it. If not, don't bother.\n\n[**The Employees** - *Olga Ravn*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/The-Employees-Audiobook\/B09RQ2FC8V?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_B09RQ2FC8V&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=XX5YBTYG2DQDPWJ6N9CP&pageLoadId=mo3KaAdKCEqvWmQ2&creativeId=4ee810cf-ac8e-4eeb-8b79-40e176d0a225) I'll be honest, this is a real quick listen, 2-1\/2 hours, and I barely remember it. Reminded me a little of the second Three Body Problem book, but yeah, sci-fi book, quick listen, I rated it 4 stars at the time. Clearly not memorable haha.\n\n[**Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland** -  *Lewis Carroll*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/Alices-Adventures-in-Wonderland-Audiobook\/B015D78L0U?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_B015D78L0U&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=XX5YBTYG2DQDPWJ6N9CP&pageLoadId=mo3KaAdKCEqvWmQ2&creativeId=4ee810cf-ac8e-4eeb-8b79-40e176d0a225) Just a classic I had never read or listened to. I think this was the end of my rut and I had just finished Harry Potter, so I wanted to ease my way back in with someone quick and easy. I'm a sucker for celebrity narrators too, Scarlett Johansson narrated this one and I loved it. I'd say it's worth it for anyone to listen to.\n\n[**The Lincoln Highway** - *Amor Towles*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/The-Lincoln-Highway-Audiobook\/0593452100?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_0593452100&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=XX5YBTYG2DQDPWJ6N9CP&pageLoadId=mo3KaAdKCEqvWmQ2&creativeId=4ee810cf-ac8e-4eeb-8b79-40e176d0a225) I feel like a broken record, but this one took me awhile to buy in to, but once I did, (say it with me), I was hooked. Just a great story, great characters, and an interesting listen. I couldn't help but picture myself as different characters, friends\/family as different ones. It ended up having a personal feel to it for me. Definitely recommend. \n\n[**And There Was Light** - *Jon Meachem*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/And-There-Was-Light-Audiobook\/B09W34YVLL?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_B09W34YVLL&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=XX5YBTYG2DQDPWJ6N9CP&pageLoadId=mo3KaAdKCEqvWmQ2&creativeId=4ee810cf-ac8e-4eeb-8b79-40e176d0a225) I waited a long time for this one. I really like Jon Meachem, so when I saw he had a new book coming out on Lincoln, it only made sense to wait for him since Lincoln was next on the list. This isn't the definitive Lincoln biography, but it is a look at his life, his presidency, and the ramifications his death had. It's a story that's been told and retold over and over. But I'll take Meachem's version any day.\n\n[**The Way I Heard It** - *Mike Rowe*](https:\/\/www.audible.com\/pd\/The-Way-I-Heard-It-Audiobook\/1508296227?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_1508296227&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=XX5YBTYG2DQDPWJ6N9CP&pageLoadId=mo3KaAdKCEqvWmQ2&creativeId=4ee810cf-ac8e-4eeb-8b79-40e176d0a225) Last book of the year, a real easy slam dunk. Mike Rowe is charismatic, engaging, and has a perfect performative voice. A combination of personal stories and historical anecdotes makes for a great easy listen. I'd encourage anyone to listen.\n\n\nOk, well, that's all for me this year. I'm currently listening to Devil in the Kitchen by Marco Pierre White. I'm really enjoying it so far, I love to cook but have only listened to Anthony Bourdain's books before. This is right up there with it.

I've no link with them and indeed I'm not even a customer yet, so I can't vouch for their service, but it seems worth checking out. I'm only posting because I think it might suit some people on this sub and because this is a business I want to be successful. I prefer not to buy from Audible\/Amazon, but would rather not pay a lot more for the privilege. \n\nThey seem to be a British company, based in Bodmin, which endears them to me on its own!\n\nThe pricing is innovative. First 5 books in a year are GBP7.99 each (for any book), which is competitive with the 1 credit per month price at Audible UK. There's no subscription so you just buy when you want a book. \n\nThe innovation is that the price drops depending on how many you buy in a year. So, once you have bought 20, the price for further purchases is GBP3.99. That's close to the cheapest price at Audible UK, which is GBP3.66. To get that, you need to buy the 24 credits annual membership, then buy an extra bundle of 3 credits for GBP11. 11\/3=3.66. \n\nAudible would still beat Xigxag if you use your credit in a 2 for 1, but still I don't think any other UK service gets close to this. \n\nWebsite here: [https:\/\/xigxag.co.uk\/pricing\/](https:\/\/xigxag.co.uk\/pricing\/) (that's a clean link)\n\nThe catalogue seems decent. On a random check in the search box for the first 10 names I thought of, they have Richard Osman, Brandon Sanderson, Robert Galbraith, Stephen King, Harlan Coben, Lee Child, Terry Pratchett, Barbara Kingsolver. They don't have Harry Potter, Kite Runner.\n\nThey also have an interesting feature with some books where you get the ebook included and can switch between them. Similar to Audible\/Kindle, except you don't pay extra for the second format.\n\nYou do seem to be locked into their app, so I'm guessing not DRM-free.

The deal Audible demands of them is unconscionable, and I\u2019m hoping that providing market forces (and talking about the issue with a megaphone) will encourage change in a positive direction.\n\nIf you want details, the current industry standard for a digital product is to pay the creator 70% on a sale. It\u2019s what Steam pays your average creator for a game sale, it\u2019s what Amazon pays on ebooks, it\u2019s what Apple pays for apps downloaded. (And they\u2019re getting heat for taking as much as they are. Rightly so.)\n\nAudible pays 40%. Almost half. For a frame of reference, most brick-and-mortar stores take around 50% on a retail product. Audible pays indie authors less than a bookstore does, when a bookstore has storefronts, sales staff, and warehousing to deal with. \n\nI knew things were bad, which is why I wanted to explore other options with the Kickstarter.  But I didn\u2019t know HOW bad.  Indeed, if indie authors don\u2019t agree to be exclusive to Audible, they get dropped from 40% to a measly 25%. Buying an audiobook through Audible instead of from another site literally costs the author money. \n\nAgain, I like the people at Audible. I like a lot about Audible. I don\u2019t want to go to war\u2014but I do have to call them out. This is shameful behavior. I\u2019ll bet you every person there will say they are a book lover. And yet, they are squeezing indie authors to death. I had several meetings with them, and I felt like I could see their embarrassment in their responses and actions. (Though that\u2019s just me reading into it, not a reference to anything they said.) \n\nHere\u2019s the problem. (I\u2019m sorry for going on at length. I\u2019m passionate about this though.) There are no true competitors to Audible. Sure, there are other companies that can buy your book\u2014but they all just list on Audible, and then take a percentage on top of what Audible is taking. Apple? Their books come in large part from Audible. Recorded Books? They are an awesome company, whom I love, but their biggest market is Audible. Macmillian, my publisher? They just turn around and put the books on Audible.\n\nI had a huge problem finding anyone who, if I sold the Secret Projects to them, wouldn\u2019t just put them on Audible\u2014and while I can\u2019t tell you details, all of their deals are around the same low rates that Audible is paying indie authors. Audible runs this town, and they set the rates. For everyone. Everywhere. (I had one seller who really wanted to work with me, who will remain unnamed, who is consistently only able to pay authors 10% on a sale. For a digital product. It\u2019s WILD.) \n\nI found two companies only\u2014in all of the deals I investigated\u2014who are willing to take on Audible. Spotify and Speechify. My Spotify deal is, unfortunately, locked behind an NDA (as is common with these kinds of deals). All I can say is that they treated me well, and I\u2019m happy. \n\nHere\u2019s where the gold star goes to Speechify. Let me tell you, they came to me and said\u2014full of enthusiasm for the project\u2014they\u2019d give me 100%. I almost took it, but then I asked the owner (who is a great guy) if this was a deal he could give other authors, or if it was a deal only Brandon Sanderson could get. He considered that, then said he\u2019d be willing to do industry standard\u201470%\u2014for any author who lists their books directly on Speechify a la carte. So I told him I wanted that deal, if he agreed to let me make the terms of our deal public. \n\nI\u2019ve made enough on this Kickstarter. I don\u2019t need to squeeze people for every penny\u2014but what I do want to do is find a way to provide options for authors. I think that by agreeing to these two deals, I\u2019m doing that. We have the open offer from Speechify, and we have Spotify trying very hard to break Audible\u2019s near-monopoly. \n\nI hope this will rejuvenate the industry. Because I do like Audible. I worry that they\u2019ll stagnate, strangle their creators, and end up burning away because of it. Real competition is good for everyone, including the companies themselves. Lack of it leads to a slow corporate death. \n\nSo I\u2019m not putting these books on Audible. Not for a year at least. Maybe longer. I need to be able to make a statement, and I realize this makes it inconvenient for many of you. I\u2019m sorry. I really am. And I know it\u2019s going to cost me a ton of sales\u2014because right now, people tend to just buy on the platform they\u2019re comfortable with. The Lost Metal preorders were 75% audio\u2014almost all through Audible. I know many of my fans, probably hundreds of thousands of them, simply won\u2019t buy the books because it\u2019s super inconvenient to go somewhere else. Indeed, Audible locks you into that mentality by making you sign up for a subscription to get proper prices on audiobooks, which then makes you even more hesitant to shop around. \n\nBut please take the time to try these books somewhere else. I\u2019ve priced them at $15\u2014the current price of a monthly subscription to Audible at their most common price point. You can get these books with no subscription and no credit. (Though you do have to buy on Spotify\/Speechify\u2019s websites\u2014and not through their apps\u2014because of monopolistic practices by certain providers. Something I\u2019m not qualified to say much about currently. Besides, this rant is already too long.)\n\nEach book you buy somewhere else helps break open this field. It will lead to lower prices, fewer subscription models, and better pay for authors. Plus, these partners I\u2019ve gone to really deserve the support for being willing to try to change things. \n\nWhew. Okay. Rant over. Let\u2019s talk print books.\"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1671750855.0},{"title":"Trying to find an app that plays mp3s in a way useful for audio books.","author":"EisConfused","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/audiobooks\/comments\/ztkj55\/trying_to_find_an_app_that_plays_mp3s_in_a_way\/","text":"I have a bunch of mp3 audio books, but I'm having a hard time listening to them because the several android apps I've tried are all made for music and they restart at the beginning of the file every time I close it.

I read Ender's Shadow in high school and am compelled to reread it.  The Little Brother series had a lot of tech talk but was very character driven.  Nothing against the books I were not feeling, but they were either trying too hard, obviously pushed an agenda, or their plot or character development or writing quality did not stand up well to the other books on the list.  Marie Lu's Legend series was definitely geared towards the young adult genre; it was solid and every enjoyable though I thought the 4th books was unnecessary (like Toy Story 4).  I appreciated the introspection and generational progression and racially charged undertones of the Noughts and Crosses series.  And who knew \"middle school books\" such as Esperanza Rising, The House of the Scorpion, and Walk Two Moons were so compelling haha.  Some books were drawn by outside influences.  My girlfriend got me into a Dungeons and Dragons campaign and my character is a Drow; that got me into the Drizzt book (playing the board game Tyrants of the Underdark helps also).  My girlfriend is a huge Overlord fan and it gave me something to bond with her.  I am caught up with the anime this year.  I will not read the other books that are currently out until the next season comes out.  \n\nI must say, I had an eclectic variety with regards to genres, writing styles, topics, and reading levels. You could kind of tell which series I was into, which I kind of stopped midway, and what my tastes and sensibilities are.  Based on this list, I am open to discussions and recommendations for books to dive into in 2023.

I have 100 codes available for the first three books of my space fantasy series, *The Starsea Cycle*. Its total run time is about 36 hours.\n\nThese codes are for Spotify, which has recently entered the audiobook game.\n\nWhat is *The Starsea Cycle*? Well, it isn't a ripoff of *The Earthsea Cycle*, despite the similarity in titles (I named it that before I realized the titles were close, but that's neither here nor there).\n\nThe best way to describe the series would be that it blends several genres, including space opera and epic fantasy. The brilliant Rob Brinkmann narrates it. If you enjoy Star Wars and The Wheel of Time, Starsea Cycle is somewhat similar to both, though this is NOT to say it's on their level.\n\nSo, I'm horrible at making things sound interesting (unless it's in a story). Those who have enjoyed my series value awesome characters, detailed worlds, and a quest plotline. And, of course, a long series with lots of details and complications. We're up to eight books now, with the first six done in audio, and two more to be released early next year. It has a lot of great ratings and reviews on platforms like Chirp and [Audiobooks.com](https:\/\/Audiobooks.com) (though the reception on Audible has been more lukewarm).\n\nThe series is a slow burn. The MC takes a while to grow and get things right; I understand that's not for everyone. You shouldn't request a code if you need a super fast pace. There are a lot of slice-of-life aspects, especially in the first two books. But you get well-rewarded if you have the patience for me to set the stage. In my opinion.\n\nAnyway, enough rambling. Did I mention I'm horrible at making things sound interesting? If you want a code, comment below, and I'll send it as soon as possible!\n\nSome caveats:\n\n* It's expected you leave a review on Spotify once you finish listening.\n* If I see your code has not been redeemed 72 hours after I sent it to you, I reserve the right to give it to someone else.\n* The deadline to request is one week from this posting.\n\nThat's it!\n\nEditing to add: I forgot to mention: Giveaway codes are redeemable on Spotify at [authors-direct.com\/spotify](https:\/\/authors-direct.com\/spotify).\n\nEDIT 2: I have some updates!  I just discovered some new info. Please read!\n\n* Audiobooks for Spotify are available only in the US, UK, IR, AU, and NZ. The code won't work if you're outside those countries. If you already got a code that won't work, just message me, and we can work something out.\n* If you have a code, PLEASE  redeem it as soon as possible. The code list Spotify gave me is janky and switches around every time I refresh it, so it helps me to see which codes are gone to avoid giving duplicate codes.\n* Originally, I said 72 hours to redeem, **but I'm going to shift the deadline to midnight on 12\/27 Eastern U.S. Time.** If you haven't redeemed it by then, the code will go to someone else. Remember, this is Spotify, not Audible!\n* Midnight 12\/27 (Eastern U.S. time)  is also the deadline to request a code (or while supplies last)\n* I won't be able to respond to everyone because I didn't foresee there being this much demand (which is awesome). Just keep an eye on your inboxes once you make your request!\n\nThanks!","upvote_ratio":0.66,"created_utc":1671573647.0},{"title":"Two month free referral code for scribd if anyone is interested","author":"nikki_potatoe","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/audiobooks\/comments\/zqr5jk\/two_month_free_referral_code_for_scribd_if_anyone\/","text":"Check out Scribd - the membership for readers!

It's such a well written book, and so many lines and images stayed with me.\n\nThe book was published in 1981, and two years later, there was a movie version starring Scott Glenn.\n\nThe story takes place in a mysterious stone keep in Romania during the Nazi occupation. An officer in the regular German army is sent there with his unit to guard the pass that the keep overlooks. Men from the village warn them not to stay there, but do they listen? Noooo. And the soldiers begin to die horribly from some violent, supernatural cause. \n\nThere are many interesting levels to the story, including some tension between the Nazis and the regular army. That's a nuance I don't remember seeing in other stories. \n\nThis is the first book in a series that I suspect was planned after this book was such a commercial success. The series is called Jack the Repairman, but I don't remember that name being used at any point in The Keep. \n\nToday, I suddenly got a hankering to read it again, and it was only $6 on Audible. I love the narrator. He's got a clipped, growly British army captain's voice that works well for the German officers' voices.\n\nI'm only a couple of hours in, so I can't say how well the book has aged. So many books don't age well. There was already some gratuitous boob description when the main female character was introduced. Hopefully, he'll keep that shit to a minimum. Hopefully this will be a book I can enjoy as much in this century as I did in the last.\n\nIt was mainly the narration I wanted to praise.

Audio files are good for most of fictional books that don't include a lot of graphics or illustrations.\n\nAs part of my job, I also read a lot of technical books and I also listen to a lot of podcasts.\n\nI am also used to record my own voice while reading any new book or article. I listen to them again while I am going to walk or when I am in car, etc. This way I could learn more.\n\nWhile simple audio recording apps are good enough to record and playback the voice, but they are not usually good for recording technical and illustrated contents because you need to have access to those illustrations while you are listening back to the audio.\n\nThis was when we have decided to design a completely new app and new format to fill the gap and the result is a new app and new format called: meCordi\n\nUsing meCordi, you can import an audio file (or record your own audio), then you can add related contents like pictures, texts, and even audio effects to timeline.\n\nWhen you play it back, we will play it in sync and as an slide show with audio in background.\n\nWe store all of these file as a single and optimized file.\n\nYou can share the complete meCordi file or, you can share audio file only and generate a PDF as a companion story board and send them separately.\n\nAll of features you require to create and share (or publish) your Illustrated audio files are there including powerful photo and audio editing features.\n\nYou can even publish them as Read-Only so your audiences (or customers) cannot change the original content.\n\nMeCordi is also the only multimedia format in market that allows you to selectively decide which part of your content should be compressed more. For example, we usually don't want our graphics or technical drawings quality sacrificed while we are trying to reduce the size of file by applying compression to our audio. MeCordi app allows you to select which part you want to optimize.\n\nAs a result, you would have a high quality audio file format (including all illustrations) with around 10-20 MB file size instead of equivalent video file with near 1-2 GB file sizes.\n\nThis will open new opportunities for creators for hosting and sharing their own audio books.\n\nFor example if you are a parent, you can create your own audio books by reading your child books and adding pictures. You can send it through Whatsapp or email.\n\nCurrently meCordi is available only for iOS devices.\n\nThe **Free version** is a full featured audio recorder and also a complete meCordi playback app. To use free version, simply close the offer page that you see when you first install the app (use X button on top).\n\nYou can run our app on your older iOS devices starting from iPhone 5s. Then this app could give a new life to your older apple devices.\n\nHere is the link if you have an interest: [https:\/\/apple.co\/3aCoXj3](https:\/\/apple.co\/3aCoXj3)\n\nWe will share limited number of promo codes, send me a personal message if you have interested.","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1670506859.0},{"title":"I have an audio book ready for upload, how or can or should I do that on Spotify?","author":"maabelleee","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/audiobooks\/comments\/zg5ud6\/i_have_an_audio_book_ready_for_upload_how_or_can\/","text":"Hello everyone, \n\nI need a bit of advice.

The title, with the mention of heaven, might suggest this is a religious story, however, outside of the concept of heaven this is not the case.\n\nAs entertaining as mysteries and historical fiction may be, sometimes a break is needed from stories with high body counts and violent deaths. Me choosing this book was supposed to be that break. I am not giving too much away in saying there are more than a few violent deaths in this story. I guess I should have foreseen that getting to heaven would be preceded with a death. \n\nThe world that Mitch Albom\u2019s creates a universal world that every reader can relate to at some level. One of the fascinating aspects of this story is that the plot\u2019s location is constant, and time is the variable that moves through this same location as the characters\u2019 lives evolve.\n\n**Review of the Narrator:** Narrated by the author, Albom has a pleasant voice. However, I felt that each character\u2019s voice was overdone. As I appreciate a narrator who uses very subtle voice variations for each character, I believe the overdone voices did not help move this story along.\n\n**Review of the Audiobook Production:** The production of this audiobook included some sound effects in addition to background music, which is a feature called \u201cBooktrack\u201d. I like these kinds of additions as it feels like I am receiving something extra readers of the traditional hardcopy version are not experiencing.\n\n**My Recommendation:** This book had me completely immersed in the story, rooting for the main character. As with all of Albom\u2019s books, it contains valuable life lessons along with the entertainment of the story and its characters. A unique concept is the way the story follows the main character through his life showing how everyday events and the people that have entered and exited his life shape and mould who he becomes. In turn, Albom\u2019s book invites you to reflect on your own life and how everyday aspects impact, shape, and mould you into the person you become.\n\nHappy listening. \ud83c\udfa7","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1670117977.0},{"title":"German Urban Fantasy with the Reaper \"Chroniken der Gefallenen: Seelendieb\" out now","author":"Tayrint","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/audiobooks\/comments\/zbh7eq\/german_urban_fantasy_with_the_reaper_chroniken\/","text":"Hello, I am Felix Borrmann and the german narrator of \"Chroniken der Gefallenen: Seelendieb \"  \n\n\nSummary\nThe Pied Piper of Czernoc is back!\n\nTo gain distance from her near-death experience and the manipulations of the shadows, the mist-shifter Alexis escapes to the slums.

Anyways, I seen it on my \"watch again\" a few days back and thought I needed to read it, as I'd never gotten around to it, and books always beat the movie. \n\nGuess there's exceptions to the rule for a purpose. The film was waay better. Not to take away from the book though. \n\nAnyways, knowing the twist I sat wondering if I'd have figured it out, and can honestly say I don't think I would have. He wrote it well, in the super vague-ness yet nudging you toward reality. \n\nI found the lack of profanity extremely annoying in the book. You're getting your face bashed in but can't drop an F bomb? Idk, took me out a little, I expected it to be more \"adult\" if that makes sense. \n\nI thought the film played it out a lot better too, timeline wise. This book seemed to be really chaotic and all over the place, which I understand as our narrator is kind of that way, but the sequence of events seemed to flow better in the film. \n\nHaaaated Marla in the book. She seemed like edgy teen. Like, I didn't get that deeply disturbed vibe off her, or that she was \"trying to hit bottom\". It felt like her whole existence was just cliche emo bullshit. Maybe it's just because her actress in the film (blanking her name) fucking crushed it so hard but I didn't find book Marla likable.\n\nThe ending I loved and hated. Film did it better (again) but I really liked that the fucking support groups came to save him. Idk, I thought it was badass that the people he conned into liking him came out to save him. Also that he pulled the trigger, though I didn't like that he botched the bomb. Like, \"Tyler, you used paraffin didn't you?\" seemed so silly. Tyler has clearly been in it, why fuck it at the end? Maybe I missed something there.\n\nAlso, I hope Edward Norton someday re-narrarates.
