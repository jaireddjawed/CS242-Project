The daily pay would be 6(16.04+20n). \n\nA typical week is 4 shifts and assuming there are no vacations, 52 weeks in a year x 4 = 208 shifts in a year.\n\nI did calculus in high school but it’s been *many* years since that, and I know that there’s gotta be a simple way to write this equation and it’s driving me mad. The long way to write this would be [6(16.04+20(1))]+[6(16.04+20(2))]+[6(16.04+20(3))] …. And so forth up to 208. \n\nHow the hell would you write this in a simpler way?

You can give me thousands or millions of integers (on a random number generator site) and I can multiply / divide / add / subtract really large sums of numbers just by glancing at them in a split second. I would impress my parents and family with this arithmetical feat. I never needed a calculator for anything involving calculation or analysis. \n\n If I'm on a math page on Wikipedia, if I'm randomly browsing a topic or sub-topic of something, I can auto-visualize the correct sequence of the symbols and numbers involved in the formula or solutions. Even if I consciously don't understand what I'm reading about; but my subconscious just 'auto-fills' the rest. But the thing is that my mathematical knowledge is only limited to basic elementary school. I slept thru all of my HS math classes and failed all of them due to depression affecting my schoolwork. \n\nIs there any hope or potential for me to be a good mathematician?

I had to take an intro to programming class, but in terms of my major classes, I am just breaking into them (this past semester, I finished Calc 2 and Linear Algebra, so I can now take the more advanced classes). \n\nI am interested to know if coding is typically emphasized in later courses, and if so, would it be enough to possibly land a job in more computer science oriented fields? \n\nAs a side note, I am aiming to become an actuary, but I would like to keep my options open. I would be willing to study coding on the side.",

The lines of \"descent\" represent the addition of a factor, so for example 240=2^(4)\\*3\\*5 can yield 480=2^(5)\\*3\\*5, 720=2^(4)\\*3^(2)\\*5, and 5040=2^(4)\\*3\\*5\\*7. I didn't include 1200=2^(4)\\*3\\*5^(2), since this is obviously less highly composite than 480, which is smaller but has the same number of factors. 5040 has three lines leading to it because it is 720\\*7, 1680\\*3, and 2520\\*2. Numbers that are not highly composite are grayed out and do not generate further candidates.\n\nWhat sticks out to me is that, so far, all of the grayed-out numbers, with the exception of 72, can only be generated by one number in the previous row, while the majority of actual highly composite numbers can be generated by multiple numbers in the previous row.",
