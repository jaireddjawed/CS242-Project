We have approved posts that didn\u2019t state why the  knowledge is useful under the guise that its usefulness was implied.  However, due to an increasing number of these types of posts, we feel it  needs to be addressed. Therefore, starting now we will be enforcing  Rule 2 more heavily. All posts must include (in the text body) an  explicit statement of why the post is useful. Even if you think the  reasoning is obvious, you still must explicitly state it. This should be  done by having a simple \u201c**Why YSK:**\u201d in the text body. (Just for those who might not know, the text body is the area where you can put additional text after the title text when creating a post.) *Please note that it should go in the text body -- not the title or the comments.*\n\nRemember that this sub is focused on self-improvement on how to do things, improve on activities, skills, and other tasks.\n\n*BASICALLY:*\n\n* All posts must include a \"**Why YSK:**\" (typed just like that) section in the text body.\n\n\\[\\[Additionally, we want to take this time to remind everyone that [r\/YouShouldKnow](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/)  is not a place to share personal stories or anecdotes.

If you sell these assets after you inherit them there is likely no tax due at all.  \n\nI\u2019m not talking about an estate tax because that only kicks in on very large estates. If \u201cdad\u201d was married the amount of his estate over $25.8M would pay an estate tax (and only the amount over $25.8M, so a $26M estate pays estate tax on $0.2M). That\u2019s a lot and doesn\u2019t apply to very many people. But a lot of us may inherit \u201cdad\u2019s\u201d house or stock account one day.\n\nA few definitions:  \nCost basis is the price paid for an asset, plus any additional costs added over time to improve or maintain the original asset.\n\nCapital gain is the sale price minus the cost basis. The capital gains are taxed, but often at a rate lower than earned income. \n\nPeople who inherit things benefit from the stepped up basis rule. The cost basis is stepped up to the current value so the capital gain is zero.  \n\nIf dad sells his vacation house and stock and leaves cash to you, he owes a lot of capital gains. If you inherit the vacation house and stock, you skip out on that tax bill.  So these capital gains are not taxed twice, they are taxed never. \n\nFrom investopedia:  Step-up in basis means that the cost basis of an inherited asset is increased to its fair market value on the date of the decedent's death. Step-up in basis, or stepped-up basis, is what happens when the price of an inherited asset on the date of the decedent's death is above its original purchase price. The tax code allows for the raising of the cost basis to the higher price, minimizing the capital gains taxes owed if the asset is sold later.  The step-up in basis provision applies to financial assets like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds as well as real estate and other tangible property. Of course, if the price of an asset has declined from that paid by the owner's date of death, the asset's cost basis would step down instead of stepping up for heirs. In practice, most cost basis adjustments after death are steps up, not steps down. This is because financial assets passed on to heirs are often long-term holdings, while financial assets and real estate tend to have positive long-term rates of return.\n\nAnd for all those people who say that the heirs have to sell the family farm in order to pay the taxes: only the value of the family farm over $25.8M is subject to estate tax. That\u2019s some family farm!  The Desmoines Register warned Iowan farmers of the death tax lie.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1678019230.0},{"title":"YSK: On iPad, you can relocate those double scroll arrows found on any sub post to anywhere on the page by first holding the arrows down then dragging it to where you want it placed","author":"trashyart200","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/11jymv4\/ysk_on_ipad_you_can_relocate_those_double_scroll\/","text":"Why YSK.

The next chunk of your income is then taxed at 12%, and so on, up to the top of your taxable income.\n\nThe progressive tax system increases the tax rate as taxable income increases. The overall effect is that higher-income taxpayers typically pay a higher rate of income tax than lower-income taxpayers.\n\nYour effective tax rate - \nWhile it's likely you will move from one tax bracket to another as your total income increases throughout the year, the actual percentage of your total income at the end of the year that goes to the IRS is different and is referred to as your effective tax rate. \n\nThe rate you must pay on the last dollar you earn (top marginal tax rate) is usually much higher than your effective tax rate.\nFor example, if half of your income is taxed at 10 percent and the other half at 12 percent, then your marginal tax rate is 12 percent (your top rate) and your effective tax rate of 11 percent (your average rate). This means that 11 cents of every dollar you earned this year goes to the IRS.  So your tax bracket is your marginal rate and is the tax rate you pay on the last dollar you earn that year.\n\n\nCurrent tax brackets - \nFor 2022, there are\u00a0seven different tax brackets with tax rates of 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35, and 37 percent. How much you will actually owe depends on both your income and your filing status as well as several other factors.\nFor example, in 2022 if you are a single filer, you will pay 10 percent on the first $10,275 of income, but if you are married filing jointly, you and your spouse remain in that lower tax bracket until your income exceeds $20,550.\n\nDeductions - \nDeductions subtract from your taxable income, which reduces your overall tax bill. The standard deduction allows you to simply deducting a flat amount, no questions asked. That flat amount is called the \"standard deduction.\" Standard deductions ensure that all taxpayers have at least some income that is not subject to federal income tax. In 2022 for example, single taxpayers and married taxpayers who file separate returns can claim a $12,950 standard deduction. Married couples filing jointly can claim an amount that's twice as large, $25,900, and taxpayers filing as \"head of household\" (unmarried individuals with dependents) can claim a standard deduction of $19,400.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677977209.0},{"title":"YSK - HP Free Ink Offer \u2013 Make sure you don\u2019t make this mistake.","author":"SmellySweatsocks","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/11iqd17\/ysk_hp_free_ink_offer_make_sure_you_dont_make\/","text":" \n\nWhy YSK? It will save you from losing control over what inks you decide to use in your HP printer.\n\nIf you already knew this, good. I wasn\u2019t aware.\n\nA few months ago, I bought an HP Officejet pro-8020. Nice printer and I\u2019ve always used HP printers as I find them to be very reliable. So, I got this one setup, and, in the setup, they advertise you can get 6 months of HP ink for free. I\u2019m thinking with the price of HP ink, I thought this was a great deal. Once your ink needs replacing, they automatically send you new ink. I'm thinking, Cool! So, my ink got low enough for the 8020 flashed that they were sending out some ink.\n\nHP ink delivery is slower than Amazon and my ink is low right now. Screw the free stuff, I got on Amazon and ordered 3rd party ink. It came in two days, and I was back in business.\n\nMy 3rd party ink finally runs low, and it needs to be replaced but by then, my HP order is in and waiting. I replace 3rd party with fresh HP ink. Back in business.\n\nNow the deal with the free ink is, you only have 6 months then you get charged the regular HP Ink rate and I\u2019m at the 6-month mark and decided to quit the free ink arrangement. I contacted HP and let them know. I\u2019m going back to 3rd party ink, and I order some. To my surprise, my printer rejected it. I blame the vendor, sent the ink back to Amazon and ordered from a different vendor. It won\u2019t work either and blamed them too. I then think, why didn\u2019t I just order from the original 3rd party vendor that did work. Surprise, that won\u2019t work either. I\u2019m now pissed and get in touch with HP. I\u2019m in a long almost hour and a half BS chat session with HP support. She did nothing but waste my time. With useless tests of my printer and the error message on it.\n\nWhen I had enough, I asked what they were going to do about this problem, they offered to send me free, HP ink. Cool but that doesn\u2019t address the problem and I turned that down.\n\nThere is a happy ending but that isn\u2019t why I\u2019m making this post. What I wanted to alert you to is if you plan at any time to use 3rd party ink in these HP printers, **DO NOT** subscribe to the free ink. What happens if you go along with this, your printer gets an **OTA ROM** update. That completely locks out your printer from using **ANY** ink except for official HP ink. Now if you never plan to use 3rd party ink, go for it. But if you want to determine what ink you use in your own printer **DO NOT subscribe** to their free ink offer.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1677999709.0},{"title":"YSK how high deductible health insurance plans work if you live in the USA.","author":"MrBleah","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/11hgrjv\/ysk_how_high_deductible_health_insurance_plans\/","text":"Why YSK: I keep seeing people confused about how these work and you can get eaten alive on healthcare costs if you don't understand this.\n\nHealth insurance in the USA is deliberately tedious to deal with, because it obfuscates how much you are actually paying to the insurance company versus how much they actually pay out.\n\nThe policies given out these days are mostly high deductible health plans and work the same way. There are some terms you should understand.\n\n# Premium\n\nThis is what you pay out of your check each pay period for the plan.\n\nThis is the obvious up front cost. Health insurance premiums are taken from pre-tax money you earn and that should also factor into your decision on cost. If you have to come out of pocket for healthcare with after-tax money you're paying that amount plus whatever income tax you paid on those earnings. That said, there are few reasonable plans where you can pay everything up front.\n\nUsually, the trade off is that if you pay more up front for the premium you pay less later out of pocket. A lower premium means a higher out of pocket cost.\n\nThis isn't always bad. If you are generally healthy and don't go to the doctor and can cover the out of pocket cost in the event of an emergency then taking a higher deductible might save you money at the end of the year assuming that emergency never comes up.\n\nI want to stress that if you do something like that, you want to have the out of pocket money available in case something does happen.\n\n# Deductible\n\nThis is the amount you have to pay out of pocket each year before the insurance will cover anything at all. Your premium does not cover any of this.\n\n# Co-Insurance\n\nWith some policies once you pay the deductible you are covered 100% afterwards. Plans that do that usually cost more up front in premiums.\n\nWith most other plans what they do instead when you reach the deductible is start paying a percentage for each procedure usually around 80% (can vary). When they do this 80\/20 split they call this co-insurance. The insurance company pays that percentage until you reach your out of pocket maximum.\n\n# Out of Pocket Maximum\n\nThis is the maximum you have to pay out of pocket each year before the insurance company will start paying everything 100%. Your premium is not counted against this.\n\nThe most confusing part is that with co-insurance the deductible is not your out of pocket maximum. You might have a $1500 deductible and then have to pay another few thousand dollars to reach your out of pocket maximum.\n\nIt's important to understand though, that the money you pay towards the deductible counts towards your out of pocket maximum. So, if you have an out of pocket maximum of $6500 and you pay $1500 towards the deductible you only have another $5000 to pay to reach the out of pocket maximum.\n\nIt can also be a bit confusing understanding that once that 80\/20 co-insurance kicks in, only the 20% you pay is counted towards your out of pocket maximum. In the above 80\/20 case if you have $5000 you have to pay to get to the maximum after you hit co-insurance, the insurance company will have been billed $25000 by the time you get to your max.\n\nInsurance pays 80% - $20000\n\nYou pay 20% - $5000\n\n# HSA\n\nIn many cases these plans include a Health Savings Account that you can put money into pre-tax from your paycheck. The maximum you can put in per year is determined by the type of plan (single or family), but is usually set up to be right around the amount you need to pay out of pocket to satisfy your out of pocket maximum.\n\nIf you know that you go to the doctor regularly for service and will come out of pocket then it is smart to put money into the HSA to cover those expenses, because it is tax free money and it's also your money, you control it, not your job. For instance, with my family we usually reach our out of pocket maximum before the end of each year so we take enough out of each paycheck to cover that.\n\nSome employers will contribute a lump sump to your HSA, so if you have a choice between a non-HSA plan and one with an HSA check how much your employer will contribute to the HSA. Whatever they contribute becomes your money that you can use for medical expenses.\n\nThe other thing to note is that HSA funds do not have to be used in the same year they are deposited. They will carry over from year to year if unused.\n\n# The Reset\n\nOne more thing. The deductible, co-insurance and out of pocket maximum reset each calendar year **(people have pointed out that some plans have 'plan years' which still run for a year, but start and end at different times of the year, unbelievable**). Meaning you have to pay all of that again the next year.\n\nIf you reach your out of pocket maximum during a calendar (or plan) year take advantage of it if you or your family need further medical care. Have your doctors schedule as much as possible before the end of the year because it's all on the insurance company at that point.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677881728.0},{"title":"YSK: It\u2019s illegal to drive with only your amber parking lights illuminated, in most of the United States, any time of day","author":"fingerfunk","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/11i2mic\/ysk_its_illegal_to_drive_with_only_your_amber\/","text":"Why YSK: As to not get pulled over by police and potentially fined.

This protects you from financial ruin if you get a heart attack, stroke, cancer, kidney failure, or basically any major illness that impedes you to do 2 out of the daily activities. \n\n**Critical Injury**\n\nAccidents are the number #1 cause of death between ages 18-44, according to the CDC. Poisening is #1 in this subgroup, but motor accidents are #2. If you were to get a critical injury that totally disables you, life insurance would pay out a partial if not all of the death benefit, and you will not have to pay the premiums anymore. Critical injury varies by state.\n\n**Terminal Illness**\n\nWhile doing research on other companies for clients, terminal illness seems to be offered by most if not all companies. If the doctor diagnoses you as terminal, the life insurance company will pay you up to half of the death benefit. So you can handle your arrangements, maybe pay off some debt, so probate court is a lot easier to handle, or cross off some things from your bucket list. The remainder of the death benefit will go to your beneficiaries. \n\n**Significance**\n\nHow many times do we hear that Americas healthcare system sucks, how many people would rather die than leave their families financially ruined? We see it on the front page quite a lot. If you can't return to work after a major illness or critical injury, that work policy will be taken away, and if you die shortly after your family will be left with nothing. You shouldn't have to unload all your assets and pay taxes on them to pay for treatment, mortgages, groceries, and bills. This is Why YSK that there are policies out there that have more than just a death benefit atrached to them, dont run to the cheapest company that doesnt offer anything other than a death benefit and is rated B or C becuase they will prolong the process to not pay.

If you are 18 - 45, the #1 cause of death is accidents. 45 and beyond is cancer and heart disease.\n\n**Living benefits**\n\nMost term life insurance companies offer this at no extra cost.

Creating a budget will help you visualize where you can cut back spending and where you can apply that money to your debt.\n\n1b) To get started, you can look at old credit card and debit card statements to get an idea of where your money is being spent on expenses, and then figure out areas in which you can cut back. Budgeting with software, websites, or apps can also make budgeting easy to stick with. Creating a budget can help you better track your money.\n\n2) Consider consolidation: If you have multiple debts with different interest rates, consolidating them into one loan with a lower interest rate can save you money and make it easier to manage your payments.\n\n3) Negotiate lower interest rates: If you have good credit, you may be able to negotiate lower interest rates on your loans, which can help you to pay them off faster.\n\n4) Create a debt repayment plan: Prioritize your debts and create a plan to pay them off as quickly as possible.\n\n5) Find ways to increase your income: Consider taking on a side hustle, negotiating a raise at work, or looking for a new job with a higher salary, to help you pay off your debts faster. \n\n5a) There are dozens of websites online that allow you to browse jobs from the comfort and convenience of your home. It does not hurt to browse jobs, and you may be able to secure a job that pays more.\n\n5b) Additionally, due to technological advances, we are also living in a time where the \u201cgig economy\u201d is more popular than ever, and it has never been easier to pick up a \u201cside hustle\u201d to earn extra cash. Many apps and websites allow you to work on your time, and on your schedule. There are so many options such as dog walking, cleaning, tutoring, being a driver, simple home repairs and handyman work, delivering food, picking up groceries, and helping others move just to name a few.\n\n6) Being frugal can help you pay down debt because by being frugal you are being more resourceful with your money. Being frugal is not the same as being cheap. Being frugal is prioritizing your spending so that you can focus on spending your hard-earned money on paying down debt.\n\n6a) It is important to have an idea of how much you spend on wants vs. needs, such as entertainment or eating out. You need to Know the difference between needs and wants.\n\n\u2022 Needs (food, shelter, utilities, basic clothing, healthcare, transportation)  \n\u2022 Wants (Entertainment, Vacations, dining out, the newest tech & electronics, new clothes\/ designer clothes, luxury car payments, multiple streaming services).\n\n7) An easy way to save and cut expenses, so that you can use that money to instead pay down debt, is to shop around for cheaper auto insurance or homeowners\/ renters insurance. By just doing a quick comparison online, you can potentially save hundreds of dollars. Other insurance companies are interested in having you as a customer and tend to offer competitive rates.\n\n8) Avoid taking on new debt: Avoid using credit cards or taking out loans unless it is absolutely necessary.\n\n9) Use the Avalanche method to pay off high-interest debt first, you can save money in the long run by reducing the amount of interest you pay overall.\n\n9a) Based on math, the debt avalanche method is the best strategy that uses money as a tool, because it will save you money due to paying less interest in the grand scheme of things. Mathematically, it makes sense to pay off debt first that charges a 21% interest rate, over debt that is only charging a 4% interest rate to borrow money.\n\n10) Stay committed to the debt repayment plan and celebrate small victories along the way to stay motivated.\n\nTwo methods to pay off debt are the \"snowball\" & \"avalanche\" methods, here are the basics:\n\nAvalanche Method:\n\n\u2022 Pay debts from highest to lowest interest rate regardless of balances.  \n\u2022 Prioritizes high-interest debts to minimize interest paid.  \n\u2022 Pros: More financially efficient, saves money on interest and helps pay off debts faster.  \n\u2022 Cons: Could take longer to pay off smaller debts, which could discourage some. It may require higher monthly payments, which could be challenging for those with limited cash flow.\n\nSnowball Method:\n\n\u2022 Pay debts from smallest to largest balances regardless of interest rates.  \n\u2022 Prioritizes momentum and motivation from quickly paying off smaller debts and helps tackle larger debts.  \n\u2022 Pros: Boosts morale, builds momentum and motivation, increasing the likelihood of staying motivated. Smaller debts paid off quickly can provide a sense of achievement.  \n\u2022 Cons: Not the most financially efficient method. It could take longer to pay off all debts and cost more interest over time.","upvote_ratio":0.68,"created_utc":1677518082.0},{"title":"YSK: Do not place round glass balls near windows","author":"mmmaddox","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/11cspib\/ysk_do_not_place_round_glass_balls_near_windows\/","text":"Why YSK: I had heard the warning about crystal balls, like fortune tellers have.

[Source](https:\/\/www1.racgp.org.au\/newsgp\/clinical\/is-it-time-to-rethink-rice-for-soft-tissue-injurie)\n\nWhy YSK: If you're the type to search the internet for medical advice (bad habit, but I am guilty of it, too) then you will almost always find conflicting recommendations if you search long enough. Among these disagreements is whether to use ice\/cold packs on injuries to reduce swelling as well as manage pain.\n\nIcing is part of the \"time-tested\" RICE protocol -- Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation, but many healthcare science professionals are starting to consider negative effects of using cold to reduce swelling. In theory it actually sounds like a bad idea to ice an injury, because *inflammation* is an integral part of the body's healing process. Icing an injury (among other things) causes blood vessels to constrict, and reduces blood flow to the injured tissues. This reduces swelling but also reduces key healing cells that have specialized jobs to repair the injury. So, swelling is good, right?\n\nWell, not for joints. If you get hit with a line drive on the forearm and develop an \"egg\", then the swelling itself is not a problem. But any time you are dealing with a sprained ankle, or knee, or elbow, the swelling does not just happen at the site of injury, which is usually just one or two tendons\/ligaments, but it affects the whole joint (more or less). This means that the other tissues are put under increased strain, and the joint loses a lot of mobility. The tissues themselves become less pliable because they are distended with fluid. The joint is stiffer and more tender, as well as possibly more vulnerable to further injury. Once swelling occurs, a portion of that swelling will (edit: can) remain for a few weeks, and this means it keeps you from using the joint for at least that long. It also could mean chronic inflammation (edit: should say development of chronic scar tissue) of the tissues, which means chronic pain\/stiffness\/susceptibility to re-injury.\n\nWhen we were less knowledgable animals (circa 1976), this was good because it increased the likelihood that we would avoid using the joint until it was healed. It was better for our body to be safe rather than sorry, because long-term complications (edit: like stiffness and reduced ROM) are preferable to catastrophic injury progression by using the damaged tissue as if it were healthy. But it (unchecked swelling) came with negative side-effects, including those described above, but also in atrophy-induced weakness and loss of proprioception of the surrounding muscles and tissues even after healing, because of the prolonged immobility of the joint. So even when the injury itself is healed, the rest of the joint is now susceptible to injury!\n\nIn summation, while icing an injury may have some unwanted reduction of the body's natural healing response, it is pretty clear that for some types of injuries, the benefits far outweigh the negative consequences. These injuries are mainly joints, especially lower limb joints which are even more susceptible to swelling because of their location relative to the heart.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a medical professional. You should only ice an injury with proper protection from frostbite (a protective barrier between the ice and skin), for 10 minutes per hour for the first 24-72 hours, and then reduce to 3-4 times per day, as needed. Always consult your doctor who actually went to school for this stuff, because I SURE DIDN'T. I'm just a guy in the waiting room with you.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n***\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\****  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nSome credentialed folks have weighed in against my post. They are pointing to some studies done that they interpret to show that icing has no statistically significant benefit to healing, in randomized trials. After reading the articles (you can, too, below!) you will see that the studies either indicate no finding (either for lack of significant correlation, or because of lack of quality data, i.e. not enough research done on this topic), or they indicate a small or weak POSITIVE correlation. I did an undergraduate degree in pure math and took 3 semesters of statistics, and I particularly enjoyed exercises in thinking about weaknesses in the numerical reasoning behind verbal interpretations of what those numbers mean. Given the results provided by commenters alone, the conclusion seems to actually be that icing is very probably generally safe and somewhat probably slightly beneficial in general.  \n\n\nPlaying Devil's Advocate, a better case AGAINST MY OPINION is made in the *Men's Health* article linked immediately below, although they don't give sources. But let's give these claims the full benefit of the doubt:  \n\n\nI found [this](https:\/\/www.menshealth.com\/fitness\/a29710918\/icing-sore-muscles\/) article summarizing the current case against icing, which points to two main theoretical drawbacks: it slows down inflammation (healing response) as well as lymphatic drainage (which flushes out swelling), and it may kill otherwise healthy tissue by restricting bloodflow to tissue that is already getting reduced bloodflow because of the injury. The articles are (allegedly, as the sources are not given...) :  \n\n\n\\- a 2013 study in the *Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research* (showing that ice reduces fluid influx by restricting blood vessels). This is pretty much accepted as true. Cryotherapy will slow down the influx of fluid, and thereby will slow down the inflammatory response of the body as the beginning of the healing process. However, I have not seen any evidence that this is anything but a temporary delay, and that the inflammation response just completes after the blood vessel restriction is over (after the ice is removed. I doubt there has ever been a study done on this, given the number of variables required to be controlled.)  \n\n\n\\- a 2015 article published in *Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy* (showing that reducing bloodflow can kill otherwise live tissue). This seems to be contradicted by another review article given by another user ([https:\/\/www.bodyworkmovementtherapies.com\/article\/S1360-8592(21)00052-8\/fulltext](https:\/\/www.bodyworkmovementtherapies.com\/article\/S1360-8592(21)00052-8\/fulltext)) which concludes that Ice is not harmful to injuries, and can be safely used in general. I assume that the cases where it is not safe to use are particularly bad injuries, or ones with complications that are generally not the case, and so it remains statistically safe for general injuries, as determined by the review article.  \n\n\n\\- They also point to a study published in the journal *Sports Medicine in 1986* (after prolonged ice exposure, lymph vessels become more permeable and leak fluid back into the interstitial space). ON THE OTHER HAND, [this](https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/9884790\/) study shows that, within certain time and temperature parameters, cryotherapy actually assists in lymphatic drainage. This counteracts (to some degree, possibly more than 100%) the bad permeability effect of the lymph vessels. \\[This is also my personal subjective experience as an outdoor swimmer, cold water definitely helps my aches and pains more than just the temporary numbing of pain, I believe it cleans out the cellular waste.\\]  \n\n\nSo my understanding is, in view of all of the aforementioned articles, the following can be said about potential drawbacks on a population-wide scale: There is no clear evidence that ice is harmful to injuries in general -- there are conflicting reports that it can worsen some injuries, but also literature reviews that tell us this is not the case in the vast majority of injuries, and it remains a safe treatment in general. This is why you still see MayoClinic, and other large medical institutions with information for public consumption, telling you to ice your injuries. They know about these studies and alternative acronyms, but they still say RICE.  \n\n\nThere IS clear evidence that ice has a few different anatomical effects, although possibly over a range of different temperatures \/ durations \/ skin coverages -- it both harms (no source given) and helps lymphatic drainage in different ways, and it slows down the body's inflammatory response.  \n\n\nMy original post was about the relative importance of reducing swelling in average sprains to knee\/ankle, and I encourage anyone with a history of injury to read these articles to draw their own conclusions. My ultimate bottom line after reading them is, Ice is good for pain, Ice is good for swelling when done properly (my subjective experience is 20 minutes at a time every hour for first few hours, then a few times a day until the swelling stabilizes, which is pretty much what every professional recommends to some degree, or another \"intermittent\" regimen of 10 minutes ever 30 min, etc.) and Ice does not kill off the body's healing process, but slows it down so that the attendant swelling does not get out of control. All this is ideal for my experience of ankle sprains, because keeping swelling down at the cost of slowing the cellular repair process, is worth it so that I can retain range of motion and so that I can resume controlled loading as soon as possible.  \n\n\nThere may be other ways to achieve the same goal, but I either find them less effective (elevation, compression) or to have drawbacks (NSAIDs, compression, massage).  \n\n\nThat's it for me, folks, thank you for anyone who is still reading this \"thread\" -- I hope this helps and doesn't hurt! Again I am not a doctor, and if you yourself have an injury, it is up to you and your doctor to make the decision about treatment, on a case-by-case basis. We are learning a lot of stuff about what's healthy and what's not these days, so be open and savvy as new info is published (Anyone see that about no \"safe level of alcohol\" anymore?)  \n\n\nStay healthy everyone!","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1676875749.0},{"title":"YSK US credit union members can use any other credit union's ATMs for deposits and withdrawals without fees","author":"NateNate60","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/116o04w\/ysk_us_credit_union_members_can_use_any_other\/","text":"Why YSK: Some people get turned off by the \"local\" nature of credit unions and think that if they travel then they won't be able to easily get cash or pay ATM fees to use out-of-network ATMs. Almost all credit unions in the US are members of the Co-op Network which lets their clients use any other US credit union's ATMs as if they were owned by the original credit union.

The email will give you ZERO information about the fact that you can avoid it.\n\nIn their contracts, it stipulates that they can raise the rates after your first year, but the contract also stipulates you have 30 days to give written notice stating you do not want a rate increase. If you provide written notice, they have a choice to either agree to keep the same rate, or they can continue with the increase. If they continue, you have the option to drop the services at that moment, without any additional penalties or early termination charges.\n\nI got that email today, so I went and read through my contract online.

Imagine my surprise that I can't do the one thing they tell me I need to do.\n\nSo, the next step was to call customer support. When I got to a representative, they informed me they could stop the rate increase over the phone, and so they did. Great right? The caveat is that this only stops it for the next year, then you do this all over again.\n\nAlso, I asked the representative on the phone for an email stating we had the conversation and that they were not increasing my bill. ADT DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF SENDING OUT AN EMAIL REGARDING YOUR CONVERSATION. I thought this was insane, but I'm not a customer support savant, and it very well could be the norm. Either way he stated he put it in the notes on his system. Fingers crossed!\n\nSo, in summary, be diligent with ADT about the emails you get and read them.

Hope I can help save some people what little bit of cash they have left!\n\nTLDR; ADT raises rates once a year, but with written communication (or apparently calling support), you can get this revoked and keep your same rate.

It also can instill a stronger sense of community in an age where most of us don't interact much with neighbors.\n\nMost importantly, they can strike.  And the fear of a total rent strike is one of the only things that has successfully halted rent increases.

One of the most common obstacles they run into is a lack of good documentation or a paper trail.  \n\n\nIn a legal context evidence is king. Your feelings and experiences may be valid, but if you are accusing your employer of wrongdoing the burden of proof is on YOU. If you don't have evidence to prove your claims law firms won't work with you and judges won't care.  \n\n\nMany employers know this. They know a lack of evidence protects them from legal action, and will suggest methods of communication that don't produce a written record. Have you ever been texting your boss or HR about an issue when they asked \"do you mind if i called you about this? it would be easier to talk.\" RED FLAG. Information given or promises made over the phone or in person don't produce a written record, and without hard evidence it may as well never have happened.  \n\n\nThe solution? If you're having issues with your employment, insist on communicating through email. Email is the gold standard of paper trails. An email chain says exactly who said what at what time to whom, and provides extremely little wiggle room. They can be easily produced and are easy to organize by subject, correspondents, and timeline.

The next day I called and the first rep told me the the previous rep was wrong and it couldn't be returned to store. I had to wait 48 hours while he contacted the vendor. I explained I'd already done that and offered to forward him the email where that has already happened. He then admitted that he saw that and told me the new policy was I had to call back at 8pm and the order would be \"unlocked\". That seemed totally made up so I told him I was going to stay on the phone until he emailed me a confirmation for that. He tried to avoid it, but I was avid I was staying on the phone until he sent me an email with that information. He hung up on me. I called back and got a new person. She told me the same spill.... 48 hours , vendor replies... blah blah.. I told her the same thing and they realized that has already been done. She then said that I could go in store and if the store manager approved we could drop it off there. Sounded made up, but I did it because I live close. The in person CS rep said no problem bring it in. After I lugged in all 3 boxes they told me nope they can't do it. I have to do it on the app. I downloaded the app and setup the return in the parking lot. Everything they told me would exist to get a return label didn't exist. I walked back in and explained this. They're annoyed now, but I'm persistent, because at this point I'm in a perpetual loop of incompetence that prevents me from returning a broken, unassembled pile of furniture. After a long wait I get to talk to the salaried manager. She tells me there is nothing they can do. When I showed her the Walmart marketplace return policy that sets a minimum set of expectations that allows me to return it in store she said that it used to be the case.

A resistive glass top electric stove is not much different than a classic coil-top electric stove except the heating elements are hidden behind a sheet of glass that is easier to clean. When you turn on the burner, you can see the heating elements glowing through the glass.\n\nAn induction stove uses a magnetic coil to generate heat inside the pot or pan itself. As such, they are extremely efficient and very fast since the heat is generated very close to the food, and nowhere else. If you turn on an induction stove with no pot present, nothing will happen. Also, only steel or cast iron pots\/pans will work. The material needs to be ferromagnetic to be heated (no copper\/aluminum) since heat is generated by repeatedly flipping the magnetic poles in the pot.\n\nI've seen several people dismiss induction stoves because they thought they used one before and had a negative experience. More than likely, they used a resistive electric. If you didn't buy the stove (renting an apartment), you likely used a resistive electric as they are much cheaper than induction and a popular choice among landlords.\n\n[In my personal experience](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Cooking\/comments\/seaint\/for_anyone_contemplating_upgrading_from_an\/), induction uses almost half the energy and can heat food almost twice as fast as resistive electric.

All of this works for a time, but requires consistent discipline and routine to actually do it\u2019s job.\n\nEventually the dry flaky behavior found its way to other parts of my skin - between my nose and cheeks, near my ears, by my eyebrows. Here too consistent moisturizer kept it at bay, but a missed day would mean a flair up.\n\nWhat I find is that not many people bring it up to their doctor - myself included. I would try many cocktails of fixes and browse the internet for a new method someone swore by. I eventually just came to the conclusion that maybe the climate is just too dry for my skin and I\u2019ve got to deal with it. \n\nHere\u2019s where a lot of ignorance in terms of dandruff comes in - dandruff is not due to the dryness of one\u2019s skin. The flaky nature of the stuff is quite the opposite. When your skin or hair is too oily, it attracts a normal fungus on your skin to have a feast and flair up. Throwing more oils at dandruff does not solve dandruff.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, I mentioned it to my doctor during my physical and he prescribed me a topical cream for my face, and a prescription shampoo for a few times a week. What I was diagnosed with was Seborrheic dermatitis - and it was in fact very treatable.\n\nSkeptical, I applied the cream without any lotion or moisturizer; not thinking it would do a thing. The shampoo as well after a shower.\n\nIt\u2019s gone. All of it. Completely gone. No flakes or problem areas anywhere overnight. It\u2019s so relieving to just have it gone. According to the PCP, it also doesn\u2019t require a refill - once it\u2019s done you\u2019re good to go.\n\nBasically tldr; talk to your Dr about bad dandruff and stop trying a concoction of remedies. It\u2019ll change your life.\n\nEDIT: woah this blew up. My prescription is as follows:\n\n- Topical Ketoconazole 2% cream\n- Ketoconazole 2% shampoo\n\nEDIT 2: A lot of you have pointed out that Head and Shoulders and lots of other shampoos have Ketoconazole as the active ingredient. Unfortunately for whatever reason this did not work for me and I had to get a prescription. Though, I think this is why you should bring it up to your Dr. - if the treatment doesn\u2019t work then your Dr. can help you navigate what will work instead of you searching the internet and trying everything!","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674289397.0},{"title":"YSK: ChatGPT Creates A Web Application In 5 Seconds","author":"warrenant","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/10hnf37\/ysk_chatgpt_creates_a_web_application_in_5_seconds\/","text":"ChatGPT generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a website that functions like an online paint application in mere seconds.\n\n[Here](https:\/\/chatgbt.net\/2023\/01\/16\/chatgpt-created-a-website-in-5-seconds\/) you can see the post where ChatGPT did that.\n\n**Why YSK:** As the world evolves, so do the tools at our disposal.

Ride Elevators and Escalators Safely With Your Dog\n\nIs your dog one of the many that steer clear of elevators and escalators? Some safety tips and proper protocol measures can help you use these fixtures with a dog. You can also use some measures to help them handle scary stairs. \n\nGoing up? Follow these tips to keep your dog safe. \n\nElevators \n\nIf you routinely use an elevator with your pet, make sure that they are wearing a breakaway collar. Always pay attention to your dog during the elevator ride, and do not become distracted by phones. Don't try to take an anxious dog in an elevator; take a brisk walk and return when they have calmed or go ahead and take the stairs. \u202f \n\nElevator Safety \n\nIt is always safest to carry your dog in and out of the elevator, but if this is not possible, know how to safely navigate an elevator with your pet: \n\nLet people get off the elevator before you enter with your dog. \nKeep the leash taut and your dog close to your side. \nLead your dog in the elevator while holding a door to prevent the elevator doors from shutting on your dog or their leash. \nCommand your dog to sit in a corner of the elevator. \nGive your dog praise for calmly following elevator procedures. \nWhen getting off the elevator, again, touch the door to ensure it does not close on your dog or the leash. \nWait until you are far from the elevator before loosening or lengthening the leash. \nAlways keep a short leash while you are getting on, riding in, and getting off an elevator with a leashed pet. An elevator ride can become dangerous if the leash gets caught in the doors, as the leash could tighten against the dog's neck. \n\nEscalators \n\nMost dogs are nervous around an escalator, and escalators and moving sidewalks can be dangerous for dogs. Skip the escalator and opt for an elevator or the stairs instead when you are with your pet, or at the very least, carry your dog on to, off of, and during the escalator ride. \n\nEscalator Safety \n\nIf you are going to let your pet use an escalator, teach them to hop over the ledge and lip on the beginning and end of the escalator. For optimal safety, only use the escalator when it is not too busy and keep the leash very taut throughout the experience. \n\nModel the small hop off the device so that the dog will also jump over the area where the steps are fed in the track of the escalator; again, keep your attention firmly focused on your pet during any use of an escalator to ensure they are safe and don't get their paws caught in the track's feed. \n\nAnxiety Around Stairs \n\nMany pet owners struggle with dogs that have a fear of stairs, particularly if the dog doesn't encounter or use steps regularly. To overcome a dog's apprehension or anxiety, be confident and calm when you approach the stairs and try to distract your dog when possible. \n\nBe patient and start small with just a few steps consistently; see your veterinary provider in San Diego to rule out any medical issue - like arthritic pain - that could be contributing to your pet's anxiety regarding stairs. \n\nUse these tips the next time you encounter an elevator, escalator, or decide to take the stairs with your canine. Make sure to always pay close attention to your pet during use of any of these fixtures to preserve their safety.\"\n\nFrom: https:\/\/www.ssdpetvet.com\/goingup-ride-elevatorsand-escalators-safelywithyour-dog#:~:text=Most%20dogs%20are%20nervous%20around,and%20during%20the%20escalator%20ride.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1674041327.0},{"title":"YSK: On desktop Wikipedia pages, you can choose between several \"skins\".

A lot of injuries result in the kitchen because of the annoying process of trying to open a stuck lid over a glass jar.\n\nIf you can't open the jar, DO **NOT** try to grip the glass jar harder in the middle to get a better grip and force your way through it, as it is easier to break it and harm yourself.\n\nWhat you should do instead, is try to warm the lid up a bit by placing your palm over the lid gently, until it stops feeling colder than your palm. Then try to open it again.\n\nGently placing\/resting the palm over the lid is important. Avoid cutting blood flow over the palm to keep your palm warm.\n\nWhy it will work? I'm not 100% sure if it is due to material expansion or the seal becomes softer with temperature, hence a slight give to it.\n\nAnd notice when someone else tries to open the jar on the 2nd attempt, it opens up. That's because the first attempt technically loosened it up with the body heat, so the 2nd attempt has a higher chance of opening the jar. (Your older sibling isn't that much stronger after all)\n\nTips: \n\n1. If the lid is too cold for your hands to warm up, DO NOT warm it up with hot water. That can shatter the glass, and called thermal shock. Instead, either wait for it to warm up a bit, or warm it up with a cold water that is still warmer than the cold jar itself\n\n2. If the lid has water droplets, wipe them off before placing your palm over it to warm it up, as water takes a lot of energy to warm up. So you'd lose body heat to warm up useless water instead of the target lid.\n\n3. Honey jars need more time to warm up until they become loose, as you also have to warm up the stuck honey between the jar and the lid that's acting like a glue\n\nDramatic Tip: place your hands over and under the jar, close your eyes while you tell a spell, shake yourself a bit, maybe whisper to the lid to open up or else (warm breath on the lid, a plus), and attempt to open it.\n\nThis is a scenario of work smart not hard.

The earlier you start investing, the more time your money has to grow.   \n\n\nBy investing a small amount each month, you'll be able to build wealth and achieve your financial goals.  \n\n\n**3) Have an emergency fund:**   \n\n\nUnexpected expenses come up at any time and having an emergency fund can provide you with the financial cushion you need to survive those unexpected expenses.  \n\n\n**4) Create a budget:**  \n\n\nThis is the most important step in taking control of your finances. A budget helps you track your income & expenses and identify areas where you can cut back & save.  \n\n\nCreating a budget ensures that you are living within your means & saving enough for retirement.  \n\n\n**5) Invest in yourself:**   \n\n\nYour biggest asset is yourself, so it's important to invest in your own education, skills, and career.   \n\n\nBy investing in yourself, you'll be able to increase your earning potential, which can help you achieve your financial goals more quickly.  \n\n\n**6) Pay off high-interest debt:**   \n\n\nHigh-interest debt, such as credit card debt, is a major damper on your finances.   \n\n\nBy paying off high-interest debt, you'll be able to free up more money each month to put toward your other financial goals.  \n\n\n**7) Use credit wisely:**   \n\n\nCredit can be a powerful tool for building wealth, but it should be used wisely.   \n\n\nMake sure to only borrow what you can afford to repay and be mindful of the interest rates.  \n\n\n**8) Develop multiple income streams:**   \n\n\nHaving multiple income streams can be a great way to increase your earning potential and build wealth.   \n\n\nThis could include starting a side business, renting out a room, or investing in rental properties.  \n\n\n**9) Consider the power of passive income:**   \n\n\nPassive income is income that you earn without actively working for it. This can include rental income, dividends from stocks, or sales from courses or ebooks.   \n\n\nBuilding passive income streams can be a great way to increase your wealth.  \n\n\n**10) Avoid lifestyle inflation:**   \n\n\nLifestyle inflation is when you increase your spending as your income increases.   \n\n\nBy avoiding lifestyle inflation, you can ensure that you are saving and investing a significant portion of your income, which is crucial for building wealth over time.  \n\n\n**11) Live below your means:**   \n\n\nOne of the most important keys to building wealth is living below your means. This means spending less than you earn, and investing the difference. This allows you to save money and invest in your future, which is the key to building wealth.  \n\n\n**12) Surround yourself with the right people:**  \n\n\nBuilding wealth isn't just about making good financial decisions, it's also about surrounding yourself with the right people, who can provide you with support, guidance, and valuable advice.  \n\n\n**13) Have the right insurance coverage:**   \n\n\nHaving insurance coverage can protect your assets and safeguard your income, in case of unexpected events.   \n\n\nHaving appropriate insurance coverage for health, life, auto, home, and liability, will give you peace of mind and protect you.  \n\n\n**14) Use the power of financial planning:**   \n\n\nFinancial planning is the process of setting financial goals, creating a plan to achieve them and managing your money to meet those goals.  \n\n\nA good financial plan can help you set realistic goals and make better financial decisions.  \n\n\n**15) Learn about and use the power of real estate investing:**   \n\n\nReal estate investing can be a great way to build wealth over time.   \n\n\nBy investing in rental properties, you can earn passive income and benefit from the long-term appreciation of the property.  \n\n\n**16) Power of tax-loss harvesting:**   \n\n\nTax-loss harvesting is a strategy that involves selling investments that have decreased in value, in order to offset any taxes that you may owe on other investments that have increased in value.   \n\n\nThis can help you reduce your overall tax bill.  \n\n\n**17) Use tax-advantaged investment accounts:**   \n\n\nTax-advantaged investment accounts such as 401(k)s, IRAs, and health savings accounts (HSAs) can help you save on taxes and grow your wealth more quickly.  \n\n\n**18) Dollar-cost averaging:**   \n\n\nDollar-cost averaging is a strategy that involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price of the investment.   \n\n\nThis strategy can help you avoid market timing.  \n\n\n**19) Avoid trying to time the market:**   \n\n\nTiming the market is a difficult, if not impossible, task. Instead of trying to time the market, focus on long-term investment strategies and dollar-cost averaging.  \n\n\n**20) Keep your emotions in check:**   \n\n\nBuilding wealth requires discipline and patience, and it can be easy to let your emotions get in the way of your financial goals.   \n\n\nKeep your emotions in check, and don't let fear or greed drive your financial decisions.  \n\n\nThe power of options trading:   \n\n\n**21) Options trading allows you to speculate on the future price movements of a stock.**   \n\n\nThis is a high-risk and high-reward strategy, and it's important to have a good understanding of the risks and rewards before getting involved.  \n\n\n**22) Be mindful of fees:**   \n\n\nFees can eat away at your returns, especially over time. Be mindful of the fees associated with investments and take steps to minimize them.  \n\n\n**23) Taking control of your finances can be difficult, but it is worth the effort.**   \n\n\nWith a plan in place and the right mindset, you can achieve your financial goals and build wealth.   \n\n\nBe patient and consistent, it's a journey worth taking.","upvote_ratio":0.65,"created_utc":1673485593.0},{"title":"YSK, if you (or your child) accidentally purchased something on Fortnite using Vbucks between Jan 2017- Sep 2022 you could be refunded due to lawsuit.","author":"The_Yogurtcloset","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/109owxh\/ysk_if_you_or_your_child_accidentally_purchased\/","text":"Why YSK, refunds for online currencies rarely happen and ofc get your money back!\n\nHere\u2019s how, visit [ftc.gov\/fortnite](https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/enforcement\/refunds\/fortnite-refunds) and check in regularly for updates. \n\n\u201cEpic Games, the company responsible for the popular online video game Fortnite, has agreed to pay $245 million to settle FTC allegations related to in-game purchases.

They'll complain so much about the heat, sweat buckets, hog the fans, \"cool down\" with iced drinks, but it doesn't occur to them to take a shower.\n\nWhy YSK: Sweat, dirt and oils from our body trap heat, and with humid weather it doesn't dry out as much as you're used to especially if you're from a colder climate, so it traps even more heat, leading to that sticky uncomfortable hot feeling. Plus us locals can smell if you're \"unwashed\" even from a few feet away so consider it as a courtesy to us as well. Lol.\n\n-----\n\nETA: Sweat alone doesn't cool you down.

It's common to see people use it as extra protection from the sun.\n\n- Those small USB-rechargable fans are also pretty popular. In the philippines, you can buy them from almost any novelty store (eg Miniso, Mumuso), supermarkets, convenience stores, roadside and mall kiosks. There's also a version that's worn around the neck.\n\n- Cooling powders are also great for when you want to freshen up on the go. It's a little harder here in the Philippines to find but you can try buying from drugstores -We usually buy them from lazada\/shoppee (our version of amazon). We love \"Snake brand\" which I think is a Thai brand.\n\n- Wet wipes are also great to have with you on the go to help with the stickiness. There are several cooling menthol kinds.

People often make this mistake because apostrophes are used to indicate possession when the subject is a noun, like 'the dog's nose' or 'Alice's restaurant', so it's easy to get into the habit of going for an apostrophe whenever possession is involved.\n\nHowever, possessive pronouns do not take apostrophes. Consider how words like 'hers', 'his', 'ours', 'yours', and 'theirs' do not have apostrophes. 'Its' is no exception.\n\nAs a bonus, 'who's' means 'who is', as in 'Who's there?'. The word meaning 'belonging to whom' is 'whose', as in 'the cat, whose paw we mentioned earlier, is wagging its tail'.\n\nEdit: Someone made a great point, which is that 'it's' can also mean 'it has', as in 'it's been a long day', so my title is incorrect.

It's an anaerobic bacteria that lives in soil and especially in horse manure","author":"Vozka","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/108f5wz\/ysk_that_tetanus_has_nothing_to_do_with_rust_its\/","text":"Every time there's a photo of some big rusty thing posted, especially shipwrecks and such, there's a highly popular comment about tetanus shots, \"tetanus speedrun\" etc.  \n  \nI can only guess where this comes from, perhaps from warnings about stepping on rusty nails, but it's wrong. The reason why rusty nails are dangerous is because they typically lie on the ground and stepping on one can mean transferring bits of soil and soil bacteria into the wound. And because, being anaerobic, tetanus is more likely to survive in a puncture wound where there's often no oxygen.   \n  \n**edit:** As has been explained below, rust may help because the small bits of un-rusted iron on it could pull out some oxygen if they're also in the wound. So there may be a point to this claim, but it's too often misunderstood, the culprit is soil.  \n  \nStepping on a dirty thorn with your bare foot or getting a dirty splinter is just as risky as stepping on a rusty nail. That said, getting tetanus from either is not *that* common. And shipwrecks in the sea are likely to be tetanus-free (still don't go there) - unless the ship is called The Tetanic, in that case be careful.  \n  \nThe highest risk comes not from stepping on stuff but from working with manure, especially horse manure. If you work with horses, tell your doctor, it may be prudent to get more frequent tetanus shots than the general population, just like big animal vets do.  \n  \n\n**Why YSK:** Because tetanus is deadly (even if uncommon) and it's important to know where it really lives.  \n  \n**source:** [Wikipedia page on Tetanus](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tetanus) is the most accessible source.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1673370938.0},{"title":"YSK potholders don't work when they're wet","author":"Phyredanse","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/108sxto\/ysk_potholders_dont_work_when_theyre_wet\/","text":"Why YSK: Fingers burn and floors don't need to eat dinner.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1673404171.0},{"title":"YSK that the right side is always cold","author":"mushroom_man__","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/108mqyt\/ysk_that_the_right_side_is_always_cold\/","text":"Early plumbing was created for right-handed people during a time when all plumbing was cold.

Because of the weird crossover\u2014though I am not a speech pathologist\u2014I have been able to help a number of classmates and friends learn how to roll their Rs. \n\nFor whatever reason, saying the word \u201cbutter\u201d (or, more specifically, \u201cbudder\u201d) helps people find the proper placement and form for their tongue to be able to roll their Rs. \n\nTo break it down:\n\nThere are three main components to rolling your Rs: tongue placement, relaxing your tongue, and air flow. \n\nFirst, you have to place your tongue properly. Breathily say , \u201cTuh, Duh, Kuh,\u201d and really concentrate on where your tongue is when you say each consonant. The T consonant is on the front of your hard palate, the D is just behind that, while the K is in the back of your soft palate. \n\nWhen you roll your Rs, you need the tip of your tongue in the middle of your hard palate, where you say your Ds. If you run your tongue against the roof of your mouth, you\u2019ll notice it\u2019s hard and flat towards the teeth, then slopes back, then flattens out again before it gets soft and becomes the soft palate. [You need your tongue at the beginning of that slope on your hard palate so the air properly passes over your tongue](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/kpyE3U5). \n\nNext is relaxing your tongue, and this is what most people who cannot roll their Rs struggle with. The goal is to relax just the tip of your tongue enough that it will vibrate back and forth as you blow air out of your mouth. It\u2019s weird, but you can practice by sticking your tongue all the way out like you\u2019re trying to lick your chin, then work on relaxing the tip while keeping it out of your mouth. (With a clean hand) you should be able to pinch and move the majority of your tongue around while still keeping it stuck out of your mouth. \n\nWhile that\u2019s a good exercise to get better control of your tongue in general, the word \u201cbutter\u201d really helps here. I\u2019ll explain more below. \n\nLast, you need air flow. Like I said before, your goal is to let the tip of your tongue vibrate as air passes over it. To get the air where you want it, press your lips together tightly into a narrow, flat line, then pout your lower lip out so you can blow air out of your mouth. The goal is to engage your cheeks so that they are tight against the sides of your teeth, so air must pass over your tongue to get out. \n\nNow we get to \u201cbutter.\u201d We\u2019re actually going to be saying the word \u201cbudder\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cbudder\u201d is perfectly formed to help you roll Rs. The B allows you to have an explosive start to the breath, which starts the tip of your tongue vibrating. The D helps you place your tongue in the right place for that rolled R. The R helps you elongate your breath so you can continue the vibration in your tongue. If you do this while holding the flat mouth pout I described above, you\u2019ll have better success. \n\nThe magic rolled R won\u2019t happen right away. You need to say, \u201cbudder budder budder\u201d over and over again. Start by repeating it so you can feel what your tongue does as it goes from the D to the R. Then, slowly make the \u201cer\u201d longer and breathier each time you say it, while saying the \u201cbudd\u201d as fast and forcefully as you can. As you do this, you may suddenly start hearing yourself say multiple \u201cD\u201d sounds\u2014that\u2019s the roll! **Once you hear that, move towards saying \u201cburr\u201d**.

Depending on what data you look at, somewhere between 80-95% of long term, purposeful weight loss attempts fail, with people regaining all or even more of the weight they lost during the attempt.\n\nhttps:\/\/newsroom.ucla.edu\/releases\/Dieting-Does-Not-Work-UCLA-Researchers-7832\n\nhttps:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/unexpected-clues-emerge-about-why-diets-fail\/#:~:text=Research%20suggests%20that%20roughly%2080,they%20lose%20within%20two%20years.\n\nThere are many reasons why a focus on weight fails, some known, others unknown. There are elements of human behavior, genetics, hormones, culture, mental health, medication, and tons of others. People who are constantly told to lose weight by friends, family, doctors, etc. can go on to suffer from anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia, and eating disorders. Many overweight people actually practice doctor avoidance for these reasons. Doctors give bad advice, or non-helpful, non-actionable advice related to weightloss.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health-news\/weight-loss-doctors-tend-to-give-ineffective-advice-to-people-with-obesity#:~:text=The%20researchers%20found%20that%20when,by%20research%2C%20the%20researchers%20said.\n\nhttps:\/\/academic.oup.com\/fampra\/advance-article\/doi\/10.1093\/fampra\/cmac137\/6849537?login=false\n\nOverweight people are often denied medical care simply being told they need to lose weight even in cases their medical needs are unrelated to their weight.\n\nIf you want to make a change for your health, you are better of focusing on new behaviors, not an outcome related to weight. Weight isn't a behavior, it's an outcome. \n\nWe're now learning that physical activity may actually be more important than weight, per se, for general health and all cause mortality.\n\nhttps:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/34417979\/\n\nCommentary from Greg Nuckols of Stronger by Science:\n\n>Just to put those findings in perspective, all-cause mortality rates are ~70-80% higher in smokers than non-smokers, and in people with a BMI of 40 vs. a BMI of 23 (for a BMI of 30 vs. 23, the difference is actually fairly trivial).\n\n>This is striking, because people (rightly) criticize smoking, and there's a lot of panic about the \"obesity epidemic,\" but activity levels seem to be more predictive of all-cause mortality rates than either smoking status or BMI.\n\nIn this study, physical activity, in the form of daily steps, was actually more predictive of all cause mortality than either weight or even smoking, a categorically negative health behavior.\n\nWhat to take away - if you have a weightloss goal, and\/or you've worked from advice from a medical professional, work towards that goal. This post is not to tell you that you can't or shouldn't lose weight. It is to lay out that weightloss as a focus, per se, has historically failed. So, not only has the medical community, with its focus on weightloss, failed to succeed in getting their patients to lose weight, they've actually made the situation worse by creating social stigma and contributing to mental health issues, eating disorders, and body dysmorphia. \n\nBased on what we're now learning about health and physical activities, I recommend focusing on behaviors rather than a weight outcome. Improve your physical fitness. It can be as simple as walking. Find what you like, what you will enjoy doing. That is the only way to make it sustainable for the longterm. Walk, jog, bike, golf, basketball, weight training, doesn't matter. If you want to look at changing your diet, don't look at \"going on a diet.\" Find a diet model that you enjoy that becomes your daily habit over time. \"Going on a diet\" implies you will go off of it. \n\nLook for ways to implement lifestyle changes that are enjoyable and sustainable for you. There is no one size fits all. Anyone who tells you this diet model or this fitness regimen is the magic one that works for everyone is mistaken or has an agenda. There are people who successfully adhere long term to nearly every diet model - balanced omnivore, plant heavy, vegetarian, vegan, Mediterranean, high carb, low carb, keto, etc. Maybe don't even try any drastic changes to your diet. Make small nudges towards healthier behaviors, e.g. increase daily fiber, make a small reduction in processed foods. Small, incremental changes have better adherence than drastic, large scale changes. Try things out and see what works for you. \n\nMove away from the obsession with weight and focus on building new behaviors. Maybe your weight will go down, maybe it won't, but your overall health will improve dramatically.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1673190543.0},{"title":"Ysk: Elon Musk is officially setting a Guinness Record","author":"communist-Daddy420","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/108dfny\/ysk_elon_musk_is_officially_setting_a_guinness\/","text":"Why Ysk: Elon Musk is officially the biggest loser ever, at least when it comes to losing personal fortune.

I was surprised at the number of things I repaired in my old car, quick fixes to electronics, solving an issue with a friend's record player speed, and much more.\n\nRather than throwing the object out, or immediately \"calling a professional \", take some time to see if a bit of time may allow you to fix it yourself.\n\nI was taught\/learned that gathering information about the issue is quite easy, doesn't take much time, and saves a ton of money. It may be an problem so simple you can do it yourself, or if not , you are equipped with knowledge of the repair proces\/time, parts cost,  and will be harder to be taken advantage of price wise.\n\n*Here is the process that I use, which is copied from a post regarding a broken clothes washer:*\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nHonestly, if you or a friend have a little bit of tool experience, and YouTube\/ Google skills, you can save a lot of money by either determining the issue, ordering the part and possibly doing the job yourself .\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by this thougnt, it may be something super cheap and easy that will save you a ton of money.\n\nAnd the first 2 steps help immensely, even if you call someone else to fix it.\n\n**Step 1:** find the Brand\n\nThe brand is usually in big letters on the outside \n[Here is my washer, obviously a Samsung](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/B7FsB2Q.jpg)\n\n\n**Step 2:** Find the Model\n\nThis will be on a sticker. Usually inside the door of the washer.

Or even one [with troubleshooting tips] \n(https:\/\/youtu.be\/2TCFjmBI4IA)\n\nYou can also try adding **Troubleshooting**, **Common Issues* \n\nIf you can describe the issue, add that after the model number,  search something like:\n\n\n**Samsung WF45M5100AW\/A5 leaks around front**\n\n[You will find videos with the exact same problem](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/oQBDA8r.jpg) including the one in red that lists the part number that you can easily look up on amazon or a local appliance parts store, which may be cheaper than the person you (may) hire.\n\nNow watch the video. If the video looks simple and like something you could do, (yourself or with a friend), then give it a go.\n\nIf you look at it and your first thought is \"This is way beyond what I feel comfortable doing, \" then at least when you call the repair person, you can ask for a quote with the Brand, Serial Number, likely issue, and ask how much the part will be  (since you have the part number from the video (sometimes its in the description).\n      \nNow when you are dealing with the person, you will be educated on the issue  know what they have to do, approximately how long it should take them (from the video) and be able to tell if they are trying to overcharge.\n\nThis 15-30 min of research can be applied to anything broken. As anything from washing machines, to computer issues, to car issues, they all usually have a few common ways they fail.\n\nAnd most likely the answer will be on YouTube, for free.\n\nThis process has saved me thousands in household repairs\/car repairs, etc.\n\nRemember, if its something life or death (like car brake lines) I would rather pay the money than risk doing a bad job.\n\nHope this helps, as it is invaluable information for saving money, whether you fix it yourself or not, the knowledge will save you money.\n\nGood luck.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1673043166.0},{"title":"YSK that if you live anywhere in the state of New York, you can access the New York Public Library.","author":"TLynn7","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/10517d5\/ysk_that_if_you_live_anywhere_in_the_state_of_new\/","text":"You just have to provide proof of residency. \n\nWhy YSK: the NYPL is huge and has a lot of resources, including a lot of ebooks that you can access without having to be in NYC.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1673028958.0},{"title":"YSK How to cook for people with dietary restrictions","author":"chequecipote","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/1056f7p\/ysk_how_to_cook_for_people_with_dietary\/","text":"Why YSK: Dietary restrictions are very common, and knowing how to accommodate them when preparing a meal can go a long way to helping friends and loved ones stay safe and comfortable.\n\nMy wife has developed a number of dietary restrictions in the last few years, and I have several friends who have a wide assortment of allergies and other dietary restrictions. I'm certainly not an expert , but I wanted to share some things I've learned over the years. Hopefully this can get you through the intimidating experience that is cooking for someone who you might seriously hurt.\n\n**Find out in advance.** If you're planning on having someone over for dinner or taking someone out to eat, ask beforehand if they have any dietary restrictions.\n\n**Learn about common allergens.** The big ones are milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans. Thankfully, companies have to mark these on their packaging, so they aren't as much of an issue. The FDA has a decent summary of these here: [https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/food\/buy-store-serve-safe-food\/food-allergies-what-you-need-know](https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/food\/buy-store-serve-safe-food\/food-allergies-what-you-need-know). However, some people have allergies to less-common foods like beef, oranges, sesame, or anything else.\n\n**Some dietary restrictions are not allergies.** People can be intolerant to a number of things, commonly including lactose (dairy) and gluten (wheat, barley, and rye). Some conditions (like Celiac's Disease) are not technically allergies, but consuming the wrong foods can still cause serious problems. If you're cooking for someone with Celiac's Disease and you're not familiar with it, the safest way to go is usually to use pre-packaged food that is labeled and certified \"gluten-free\". It is also valuable to understand vegan\/vegetarian dietary needs.\n\n**Be careful with spices and sauces.** Spices and sauces often contain allergens, and it took me a long time to start instinctively checking them. A friend of mine went to the hospital because someone completely forgot oyster sauce contains shellfish and put it in some orange chicken.\n\n**Save Packaging.** When we visit my parents, they save or take a picture of the ingredient list for everything they cook with so my wife can check them before we eat. We've mostly learned what brands of common foods are safe for her, but it's really nice being able to double-check.\n\n**Look out for cross-contamination.** When you're cooking for someone with an allergy or serious dietary restriction, cross-contamination can be a huge issue. It is usually courteous to ask in advance if they are sensitive to cross-contamination, or if they only need to avoid large amounts of an allergen. Cookware and utensils are common culprits for cross-contamination. Spreading butter on toast and dipping the knife back in the butter, for example, is an easy way to get gluten in the next dish you cook with that butter. For some very sensitive people, cooking an allergen in a cast iron pan or using a contaminated wooden utensil can cause a reaction, since it is nearly impossible to get allergens completely out of cast iron and wood. Silicone, glass, stainless steel, and nonstick are usually safe bets for cooking allergy-friendly.\n\n**People know what they can eat.** If someone has a lot of dietary restrictions, it can be helpful to simply ask what they like to eat. They will almost certainly have ideas that are easy to cook. When my father-in-law was trying to figure out what to feed us when we visit (after my wife found out she has Celiac's Disease and a few other allergies), we gave him some recipes she can have, and we labeled his spices and sauce mixes so he knows at a glance what she can eat.\n\n**Have a couple go-to recipes.** If you often feed guests, it's good to know a few recipes that are naturally free of most common allergens. Here are a few ideas of allergy-aware foods we like to make:\n\n* Stir fried chicken or beef with vegetables served with rice (using a safe sauce)\n* Roast chicken (we roast a whole chicken with some vegetables in a dutch oven in the oven)\n* Tacos in corn shells with Spanish rice (using a safe taco seasoning)\n* Self-assembled southwest bowls (with things like chicken, beans, rice, corn, tomatoes, lettuce, and cucumber with a safe dressing)\n* Orange or sweet-and-sour chicken (breaded in cornstarch and fried before adding a safe sauce)\n\nHopefully this can be helpful. It can be really intimidating to cook for someone with dietary restrictions, but it really just takes a bit more caution than typical cooking.","upvote_ratio":0.68,"created_utc":1673041292.0},{"title":"Ysk that you should check energy effcient grade while buying electronic products.","author":"Hallowmew","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/104wlxf\/ysk_that_you_should_check_energy_effcient_grade\/","text":"Why YSK: You can see that most electronic products boxes and packaging have an energy efficiency grade.

Oral thermometers generally read a core body temperature LOWER than what it actually is\n\nMost importantly you should know this because it is directly related to your health!\n\nFor example [Long story] my primary digital thermometer registers my body temperature consistently at 97.6 degrees.  If I feel a fever and check my temperature and the thermometer is displaying 101.2 degrees it doesn't mean my temperature is 101.2 or 102.2 or 100.2.  It would simply mean my body temperature has increased by 3.6 degrees.  Understanding this is important because the standardized average temperature is based on 98.6 degrees.  Under this assumption, without knowing the thermometer tolerances\/accuracy\/baseline reading it would seem the temperature was 101.2, a low grade fever.  But the fever was at least a 1 degree higher.  At 102.2 a fever needs to be treated differently and monitored more closely.  At 101.2 a fever is mostly far less serious.\n\nAn oral thermometer is extremely common.  Most are limited.  It is a matter of safety and health to know how the one you own operates (if you have one) and what it reads your baseline temperature at (go the distance and average it after sleep, mid day, before rest, and so forth).  If possible have a second oral thermometer.  Also there are other methods to measure body temperature.  \n\nIt is very important.

Therefore, a good way of bypassing phone menus and numerous back and forths with customer service reps is to find the CEO's email address and email directly. I'm sure this won't work for *every* company, but it will work more than you think.\n\nI work for one of the largest tech companies in the world, with a $10b market cap and operating in 6 continents and dozens of countries. Almost daily I get messages that have been forwarded from our billionaire CEO through the entire C-Suite chain of command, that trickle down to me in middle management. As the audience is pretty high up, you can imagine these issues are treated with a great deal of urgency. The thing is, almost *none* of it is important. We will get repeated messages about a $3 refund they want, or about how they are upset that blah blah blah was changed, or whatever. Very little of what I end up handing is significant. BUT these very quickly become bloated threads, with software engineers, our legal team, account execs, etc. all getting involved. 99% of the time it is a pointless use of resources. But 1% of the time, some user will have found a gap in our policies or processes, and in identifying that, could save us millions of dollars. Maybe it is something we want to prevent from getting exploited, or maybe we don't want the bad press, or maybe it just isn't an efficient way of doing things. This is why these issues get treated so quickly. \n\nMost of these issues won't fall into an easy bucket for the customer service team to handle, and nearly all of that work is outsourced to a half dozen countries around the world. Meaning a lot of agents will incorrectly disposition an issue and file it as \"resolved\" just to move on. When a user gets so irate about it they email the CEO, it almost universally gets a speedy resolution. We are more likely to issue a refund on something for $3 even though it is out of policy than we are to adhere to said policy and continue angering the individual. Going through the proper channels (emailing customer service, calling, using the chat feature), that will never happen. \n\nSo next time you are having some issues with customer service, find the names of everyone in the C-Suite and email them. If you can find their actual email address, perfect. But most likely you'll just have to guess. Is John Doe the CEO of XYZ Corp? Try every variation of that email. A bunch will bounce back, but you're likely to get one through.\n\nEdit: some in the comments seem to think I\u2019m referring to you as an employee emailing the CEO, but I mean you as the customer.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1672782577.0},{"title":"YSK: how to get reduced pricing for theater shows and events.","author":"Square-Dragonfruit76","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/102e9tb\/ysk_how_to_get_reduced_pricing_for_theater_shows\/","text":"If you go online, the price is often jacked up due to fees from the online distributor.

If they are mistakenly allowed to reenter by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at an airport or other port of entry (like a land border crossing), they can later be found to be deportable and can be placed in removal proceedings.\n\nEDIT: Learned from the comments that National Parks are federal land and fall under federal laws,  so your state might be cannabis friendly but once you  enter the park\u2026 same goes for any federal land.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1672383789.0},{"title":"YSK: Air-fried french fries has 70% lesser calories than regular french fries.","author":"Bhallaladevaa","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/YouShouldKnow\/comments\/zy0pv3\/ysk_airfried_french_fries_has_70_lesser_calories\/","text":"Why YSK: Many of us are trying to lose weight and we occasionally crave cheat meals and these cravings can sometimes get out of hand.
