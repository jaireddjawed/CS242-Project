        "text": "I just finished S2 and this show has been a phenomenol and eye opening experience. So much so that I've been staying up all night watching episode after episode. One episode that I wanted clarification, though, was 15 MM. \n\nBasically, my question is whether Abi \"accepted\" the offer to join the pornographic Wraith stream because she, despite feeling/being shown as reluctant, ultimately decided to accept the judge's offer to escape the cycling tier of society or because she was coerced by the drugs the attendants gave her before her performance. This seems like a minute detail but, to me, it gives the entire latter half of the episode new context. For example, Bing going mental in his room and later rebelling the way he did because of a feeling of betrayal at her abandonment versus feeling of vindication at a dystopian society that screwed over a person he cared about. He's clearly shown also having knowledge about the drug having brought the empty container with him in his second interaction with the reality show. I've been looking around on reviews/wiki plot summaries online trying to find clarification on this to no avail.\n\nEdit: Also, while I'm here, I'm wondering if you guys think that could be a reason why he ultimately \"Accepted\" the judge's offer. Maybe to try and actually help her? (As evidenced by the penguin at the end?) I hope I don't sound *too* melodramatic, but wouldn't this imply that he's not quite the sellout that we thought he was, but the tragic hero doing what he does for the person he loves. What's the say that wooden sculpture wasn't made by Abi herself, perhaps as either another thank-you (like the oragami penguin) or as decoration for their apartment?\n\nI appreciate any/all inputs and responses. Thank you.",

[SPOILER ALERT] (/s \"this comes up a bit more in Black Museum in Season 6\") but I'm more referring to the ending of San Junipero.\n\nThe idea of your consciousness existing outside of your brain comes down to different discussions, both scientific (as in, does the consciousness even have it's own form that could be altered or transferred) and also philosophical/theological (what is a conscious, is it a soul, etc).\n\nWhat is everyone's thoughts on whether the human race would actually be able to develop technology or some sort of method of maintaining the conscious after death, essentially allowing people to become immortal in a way.\n\nThe only way I could see this feasibly happening is some sort of operation (probably for the super rich) where their brain is put into cryo and they are connected via plugs to a virtual interface, that way the brain still survives which generates the consciousness. I say super rich because this is not something I could see them offering to everyone as it would have a considerable cost and storage issues. I'd like to think that the brain could be moved to a tiny, easily stored plug but then I run into the star trek problem, where every time they energize transport, they are essentially dieing and being rebuilt. I could see a computer \"rebuilding\" us onto a digital form, but technically for me in my body, I have died and a new version of me now exists.\n\nAnyways, what's your guys/gals thoughts?\n",

        "text": "After a re-watch, I did some thinking about theories I've read, and came to my own conclusions I don't think I've seen before.  \n\nBranching off the cookie theory, I think that the community in 15 million merits isn't so much an entertainment farm as some people think, I believe it is a market research farm, likely owned by a large media conglomerate.  I agree with previous theories that the cycling does nothing, it's simply to occupy minds to prevent insanity.  \n\nThe reason everyone is youngish, is because that's the key research demographic. Roughly 18-45.  I don't necessarily think they utilize the content created for broadcast purposes (though I'm not specifically opposed to), it's to base content generation.  That's a partial reason everything is monetized.  Skip a commercial?  That info is collected and studied.  What subjects rarely get skipped?  What subjects get skipped immediately?  \n\nIt's also a partial explanation as to why society seemed to shift so lowbrow openly,, with the porn and fat slob show.  This isn't an actual shift in culture, they just openly broadcast in the cookie world.  \n\nI'd imagine the large cookie population was easy to get for a media company, \"allow us to extract your cookie for a 20 dollar/quid/unit discount from your television/internet bill for 12 months!\"   This would also aid in talent recruitment and try outs, you already know who is going to be popular with your exact target audience.  It's also part of the reason that hotshots isn't just a singing/talent competition, and they can so easily switch the role.  They've already found someone with a popular look and personality, now they just have to plug it in the right position.  \n\nThe cool part about this would be picturing a cookie academia simulation, where all the world's doctors and scientists are working to solve all of society's problems.  The horrifying part is that I would guarantee that in China or somewhere similar, there is a cookie world consisting purely of children perpetually playing with toy prototypes",

Everything in this episode shows tech being a bad thing *except* that one moment. Maybe this is about highlighting the idea that its not what is used, but how its used. San Junipero is a heartwarming example of the tech being used for good, a rarety in this series, and with Nish blaming Haynes for the torture (and rightfully so) wouldnt this mean she knows that its the one using the tech.. not the tech itself. \n\nThis follows suit with Nosedive (a personal favourite). That episode circles round how the protaganists shitty life is entrenched with tech. The only truly happy ones are those using the tech for good, cutting down on it and not using it to control others. \n\nBlack mirror does such a good job at making tech look bad I think sometimes I forget its actually usually the protagonist abusing it or becoming entrenched by it, much like Haynes.",

        "text": "Everyone thinks Metalhead is the end of the timeline but what if we are actually seeing the middle of the timeline in Metalhead. Initially things are much like our world. Be Right Back doesn't require the cookie technology or neural interfacing - it harvests social media to make the personalities for its insanely realistic robots. \n\nThere is a moment when the show moves into the future, and that is when all the bees die offscreen. Bees and associated pollinator insects are dying out in the real world. If this went to the logical conclusion you would have all flowering plants dying out in short order, this would eventually lead to desertification and possibly Ireland ending up looking like Iceland like in Crocodile. HOWEVER: The total collapse of all flowering plants would not happen all at once or everywhere at once, even after it became irreversible. The attempt to make artificial pollenating robots like in Hated in the Nation would stave off collapse in the countries rich enough to have them, but that technology might end up banned after the events in the episode. Faced with food shortages, you might see the government taking increasingly draconian measures - Men Against Fire [Spoiler Alert](/s \"might be about the government designating certain bloodlines as roaches and eliminating them to reduce the ecological burden during the hard times to come\") which would explain why they were willing to burn food today, but at the same time were acting in such an inhuman fashion. After that Metalhead could be [Spoiler Alert](/s \"a separatist bloc attempts to rebel against the eugenic practices that are being put into place and as punishment is totally depopulated by the Dogs.\") \n\nThe events of Crocodile happen about the same time as Arkangel, The Waldo Moment, Shut Up and Dance, Men Against Fire, The National Anthem and White Bear. The brutality of White Bear in particular is normalized in this world of increasingly desperate people. Mia builds the complexes to house the poor that we see in 15 Million Merits. This is the low point of humanity. TKCR cookie tech hasn't arrived yet, but somewhere out there Rolo is [Spoiler Alert](/s \"installing the sensory transfer system in a doctor's head.\") \n\nThe cookie technology from White Christmas is invented shortly after with The Entire History of You, Playtest, USS Callister and San Junipero happening in this time period, as can be seen by the advancing state of brain interface tech until they end up with those neat little buttons that non-invasively copy your personality [Spoiler Alert](/s \"leaving your body on the couch.\") \n\nIn my mind, Nosedive, Hang the DJ and Black Museum happen last - and we are seeing an attempt at repopulating the world after a crisis period. And trees are back, reconstituted from DNA to not need bees. In nosedive everyone has an augmented reality set in their contact lenses, and Hang the DJ really needs cookie technology to work.  This is the bleakest and most satisfying outcome for me, because the world didn't end and humans and cookies will suffer for many more episodes to come.",

        "text": "... Kenny’s family was established as being very religious and sheltered. The consensus on the episode seems to be that everyone was wondering from the beginning why Kenny was willing to do literally anything, even kill, to stop the video from leaking when it’s safe to say that most of the population masturbates to porn. His desperation makes sense only when you realize he was watching child porn, which means there’s much more at stake than some embarrassment. But if he was in a family that made masturbation out to be a terrible sin, his reaction would make more sense and the twist that it was actually CP would be that much more shocking.\n\nAlso, how does the video of him prove what he was looking at? I originally thought it must be videos that could be heard through the recording that would implicate him, but he said several times it was only pictures. Why wasn’t this something he could’ve reasonably denied?",
