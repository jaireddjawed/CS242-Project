For the last few years we've been increasingly uploading things from our lives to the internet, like information and communication. You could easily think this will continue infinitely to the point where our entire lives exist online. But I think that's the wrong conclusion. Internet is, and should remain, a tool. We've seen the negative effects of people living their lives through the internet. It's not healthy. People don't want virtual lives. People still enjoy going outside, they enjoy talking, touching, feeling. What we should do is we should bring the internet to the physical world. We should use AR rather than VR. We should add to our real lives rather than abandoning them. \n\nAt least this is what I hope happens. Maybe Zuckerberg is right, maybe the metaverse is revolutionary and our future way of living. Maybe it's ahead of its time and we're limited by our old-fashioned thinking. We will see.",

        "text": "Recently, I found a Chrome extension called Engage AI. I've been using the tool for the past week or two. I wanted to share my experience with it.\n\nThe Chrome extension essentially writes comments for you for LinkedIn posts. All you have to do is copy the link of a post and paste it into the extension. The app scrapes information from the post and comments, then it generates a related comment for you using AI.\n\nThe comments generated by the extension are accurate and have perfect spelling and grammar. They sound genuine, human, and high-effort, far better than generic comments such as \"Great post\" or \"Thanks for sharing.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the comments aren’t always accurate. Occasionally, the app will generate a comment that doesn’t make much sense with the post and I need to refresh it. It’s also a shame that it’s specific for LinkedIn and no other platforms, so you’re out of luck if you don’t use LI.\n\nIt's not for everyone, but for someone like me who uses LinkedIn to build relationships with leads for my employer, it's a great help. I feel like VAs could benefit a lot from this, and anyone else trying to stay in front of your target audience on LinkedIn.\n\nPersonally, I comment on prospects' posts on a weekly basis. It can take me hours to come up with, say, twenty insightful and well-thought-out comments. With this extension, those hours are reduced to just a few minutes. I've gotten positive feedback from the comments I've made with it so far.\n\nOverall, the app is a great time-saver and saves me the effort of needing to write a comment that makes sense in a field I’m not always familiar with. I’m already on the paid plan, but there’s a free trial if you want to test it out.\n\nIf anyone else has tried it, I would love to hear your thoughts.",

        "text": "I seen a recent post where the person was thinking 3D printers are going to be in every home. This isn't realistic, and one thing people who don't own one seem to not know this isn't as simple as a paper printer. Jamming happens, getting the thing to stick to the plate can be a nightmare, changing hotends is a thing and currently no way plug and play, and so on. This is just FDM printing. And then resin printing you are dealing with harsh chemicals.\n\nPlus the waste you can't do anything with and it builds up fast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is more realistic is programmable matter. This is a good video on what is likely to happen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN7BUKb0OIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN7BUKb0OIA)\n\nThis gets into claytronics but there is other types of programmable matter. But I think this is the highest likely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt should be noted we already have this stuff tested and working. Not to a degree to be used in homes, and the holdup is actually nanobots. The tech isn't good enough **YET**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What will happen?\n\nYou will have something. This something might be some liquid, solid block, or maybe dust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou will tell some interface you want a chair, table, etc. Or a number of things. Maybe you have people coming over and need a bigger table, more plates, and so on. You tell the interface what you want.\n\nThen after they leave, you tell the interface you don't need the stuff anymore, and it turns back into the previous state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt might even be smart enough where you can tell it you want the chair or whatever here, and it moves to/from there when it makes it or goes back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDepending on the stuff used, it might even be possible to tell the interface you want to go to bed. It makes the bed in front of you including the bedsheets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow there is limits to the technology. You can't be like I want a car, and a car is made. Like if it has enough energy technically it could make a car and take you where you want. But it isn't a true car. At least at first. The material it brings would have to be right. Like it is likely the material used will be basic stuff that will be able to change hardness to a point and color (changing the structure of something in RL can change the color. There has been experiments in RL where if you shoot lasers at something to change the structure which changes color of things and make paint simply not needed.)\n\nBut it is likely at some point you could have different materials which makes more complex things like a battery, a computer, a car, etc. Maybe even have it where the matter could have raw carbon and other things next to it to use as needed. But at this stage it's an unknown since there is likely more understanding in the quantum field which might help with this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny case, basic items like a chair, cup, and so on should be possible. It could even be possible to make a moving art thing on hand rails.\n\nDepending on things, it could even be possible to make a 3D TV like thing. The video shows things coming out of a TV. But at this stage if it can make mostly any shape and color. As long as you have a speaker somewhere, it can sync up and on one of the walls or maybe middle of the floor you cand see a full movie as if you were there.  Like you can walk around the characters and even touch them depending on the safety. Keep in mind it can control the hardness. So even if it hits you, it can make it so soft it's like a blanket falling on you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt would also be possible to have a robot helper around the house with this. Remember, this stuff moves on its own and can make any shape. Meaning it technically should be possible to get it to do basic cleaning and even make you a virtual romantic partner.\n\nAnd with mods like it grabbing a small speaker some AI somewhere controls. It might be able to talk and look like it's moving it's mouth when doing so.",

        "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare in many ways, and one of the most promising areas is in the field of diagnostic imaging and drug development.\n\nIn diagnostic imaging, AI can assist doctors in identifying and analyzing medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. This can help to improve the accuracy of diagnoses and reduce the need for invasive procedures. Additionally, AI can be used to develop computer-aided detection (CAD) systems that can automatically identify abnormalities in medical images, such as tumors or other masses. This can help to improve patient outcomes by detecting diseases at an earlier stage.\n\nAnother area where AI is making significant strides is in drug development. AI can be used to analyze large amounts of data, such as genetic and molecular data, to identify new drug targets and predict which compounds will be most effective. Additionally, AI can assist in the design and optimization of clinical trials, helping to speed up the drug development process.\n\nOverall, the increased use of AI in healthcare has the potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs and make healthcare more efficient. However, it is important to note that the implementation of AI in healthcare should be done responsibly, taking into account ethical and privacy concerns.\n\nLet me know your thought about this topic",

        "text": "Everything will be EV, including semis and motorcycles; these 2 types of vehicles needed this new battery chemistry that is only slightly more energy dense than Li-ion but improving every year and is said to eventually double Li-ion density eventually (insert whatever chemistry  you think will win. Solid state, lithium sulfur etc.). \n\nThis new battery is expensive. It's used first in drones, phones, laptops etc, but since it's the thing EVs have been waiting for, it's scaled quickly to drive down the price, as Tesla and Panasonic did with Li-ion. So it's 2030 and this new battery is double the price of Li-ion, but Li-ion has come down in price every year since this new battery is first produced on a small scale in 2025. Most people now buy EV because: 1. they are pretty much all that is being produced and 2. They are cheaper than ICE.\n\nWhile Li-ion battery tech improved between 2023 and 2030, it was only by about 1% per year; whereas Lithium-iron-phosphate and Sodium-ion were improved by around 2% per year while at the same time becoming cheaper. In 2030 Li-ion and LiFePo have almost no room for improvement and can't get much cheaper, but Sodium-ion still has room to get cheaper. It's being increasingly used in stationary storage because of the price and battery life, but is now being put in 100 mile range ($5000) street cars that were formerly built using LiFePo. Lithium iron phosphate has improved to the energy density of 2020 Li-ion and is now suitable for EVs in general. They are cheaper, perform better than Li-ion in cold weather, and have ten thousand or more charge cycles in their lifetime. An inexpensive car built with these costs around $15,000. Since they are not explosive, they are able to be integrated in the frame as part of the structure, displacing some frame weight. The real world range is between 300 and 550 miles and because of aerodynamics, solar and other efficiencies such as regenerative suspension (going over bumps sends a little charge). Charging is everywhere and gas stations are repurposed. Vehicles are so efficient that just a level 2 charge gives significant range in the time it takes to eat lunch. Gas stations find other products and services to sell while you are waiting. Charging slowly is free, you just have to let an ad play. The stations are motivated by you spending money in-store. DCFC is used off the highway for people on road trips and truckers, but most people are content with L2 chargers which are free. Gas stations  figured out they didn't have to bring in new transmission lines to just provide L2. In addition, most stations use a solar array with stationary storage. Solar has continued to decrease in price and by 2030 it's everywhere. The cost and maintenance of the array is recouped from the ads. Someone could purchase a $5000 vehicle that is fuelled for free and almost never needs maintenance. They could finance it over 5 years.. 60 months, and have a car payment under $100/month. They could also put the vehicle on a sharing app and have someone pay them to use it when they aren't using it. If they weren't using it for a couple days they could make enough for the car payment, making it a free car with free fuel. Of course if they charge at home that's not free but it's extremely inexpensive. Many people are adding small solar systems  to their houses. During the day while they are not home, the electricity is sent to the grid or a neighborhood battery bank to use later. Electric bills are very small for most people not only because of their solar panels, but since most people are in the virtual power grid, the price is driven down.\n\nAs gas vehicles become obsolete (do you want to pay $10 to $100 per day or $0?) it's posited what we should do with them. Some are crushed, some are converted to EV, and some like big box trucks are converted to tiny houses.\n\nSmall airplanes have been being converted to EV for years, but it took the battery chemistry advancement for short-hop flights and midsized planes to be feasible. In 2030 large jets are being built to take off and land with electric engines but use jets when they are at altitude, saving fuel. There are also hydrogen fuel cell/battery hybrids and a company with a working prototype of a large jet that uses a micro nuclear reactor to charge an 800 kwh battery pulled from a used Tesla semi. They say the plane will only need to be fuelled once every 30 years.",
