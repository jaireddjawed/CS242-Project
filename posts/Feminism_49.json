        "text": "First of all I am a man and am for a modern feminism.\n\nAs a father of a young daughter myself, I want her to have all the chances man have and that she can rely on herself and her skills.\n\nBut 2 things I never hear from feminist and dont get are:\n\n1. That women no matter which position they have in society tend to have heavy bias against other women. Only one example is the wife of a friend of mine which is a doctor. And she even got to run several clinics. He is a doctor himself and when they worked in the same hospital he became lots of cakes and other treats from the mostly female nurses. His wife on the other hand got none because of envy.\nThe same women also tried to create a community of successful women who could push each other to get even better jobs or better position in society. This idea failed because of small things like bias against expensive hand bags from the women attending and other little things. There are also studies that suggest that women in even small groups of five cant work as productive as five man commonly. Because its harder for them to keep personal differences out of the work atmosphere. Why does no one talk about that insanity?\n\n2. I completely understand that many women dont like the approach many man do when it comes to flirting. Especially when its sexually aggressive or without shame and dignity against the other sex.\nBut what I dont get is why they think man will change because they call them out for that. Yes if you are smart and understand what the other sex want you wouldnt act that way. But will all man ever be that way? Are all women smart and know what man want?\nTo come to the point I dont get why women and especially feminist, which complain (rightfully) about such a behaviour, doesnt support a change in womens behaviour when it comes to flirting or approaching the different sex. If you as a women doesnt want that behaviour why you dont do the first step when it comes to approaching men? And dont promote such a selfreliable behaviour to other women?\nI mean for me its like going to a restaurant because you want to eat but saying the man does the ordering for both of you because it always was that way (in the past). And when he at the end orders fish for example  and you tell him thats offending because you hate fish. Where is the logic? \nI for mine learned the hard way that talking and pointing the finger at something that isnt right is easier, but less effective.\nAs actually changing your own behaviour to change the counterpart. I know it isnt fair, but its more effective from my experiences in many fields.\n\nCurious about how especially feminists and women think about that food for thought especially.\n\nNo native speaker so please no hate for grammar mistakes. Love you all.",

Her word isn't enough once she's drunk, but what if i ask ahead of time AND in the moment for an enthusiastic yes? Or could i ask several times through the night as we both get more drunk to make sure she's still very interested in having sex? Is there any moral way to experience drunk sex?",

The British Navy, wary of the cost of expanding the treatment, turned to malt wort, a mashed and cooked byproduct of barley which had the advantage of being cheaper but the disadvantage of doing nothing whatsoever to cure scurvy. In 1747, a British doctor named James Lind conducted an experiment where he gave one group of sailors citrus slices and the others vinegar or seawater or cider. The results couldn‚Äôt have been clearer. The crewmen who ate fruit improved so quickly that they were able to help care for the others as they languished. Lind published his findings, but died before anyone got around to implementing them nearly 50 years later.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This kind of myopia repeats throughout history. Seat belts were invented long before the automobile but weren‚Äôt mandatory in cars until the 1960s. The first confirmed death from asbestos exposure was recorded in 1906, but the U.S. didn‚Äôt start banning the chemical until 1973. Every discovery in public health, no matter how significant, must compete with the traditions, assumptions and financial incentives of the society implementing it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Which brings us to one of the largest gaps between science and practice in our own time. Years from now, we will look back in horror at the counterproductive ways we addressed the obesity epidemic and the barbaric ways we treated fat people‚Äîlong after we knew there was a better path.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
