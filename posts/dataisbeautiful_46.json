        "text": "Anas Kataya, a 22-year-old Franco-Syrian student in dental medicine, who was educated at the faculty of Brest and who was doing an Erasmus exchange with the University of Porto Fernando Pessoa, was sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment for  the murder of 23-year-old Portuguese student Paulo Correia in the city of Porto, in October 2021.\n\n Mr. Kataya had tried to flee by car after the facts by accusing one of his acolytes.  His group had videotaped themselves inside the prison van joking after beating the young man to death.\n\n\nhttps://www.cmjornal.pt/portugal/detalhe/grupo-de-franceses-que-agrediu-jovem-no-porto-grava-video-dentro-de-carrinha-celular\n\n In addition to the prison sentence, to be served in Portugal, the court of São João Novo, in Porto, which tried the accused, also condemned Anas Kataya to pay 202,000 euros to the parents of the victim, Paulo Correia, 23 years old.  The latter was a basketball player of the Guifões Sport Clube, in the municipality of Matosinhos, district of Porto.\n\n The student's family was asking for 535,000 euros in damages.  Anas' parents, who were present in court, reacted to the sentence with tears and great regret.\n\n The other defendant in this case, Jean Paul Jelali, who attacked another young man with a bottle on his head, was sentenced to 10 months in prison, with a one-year suspended sentence.\n\n The case occurred in the early hours of October 20, 2021, near a nightclub on Passos Manuel Street in central Porto.  A group of friends had a disagreement with young French women in the entrance queue.  There was confusion, insults and hair pulling between Portuguese and French women and the latter were forced to leave the queue.  They left and complained about this episode to friends, including Anas Kataya, a group that went to the Portuguese and attacked them.\n\n The court ruled that it was proven that Anas walked towards Paulo when he realized that he was crossing the road in an attempt to avoid the confrontation.  As he was about to reach the other side of the street, Anas punched and kicked him in the face and head, then went after the deceased victim,  \"pushing him very hard in the head\", the indictment states, noting that the victim staggered towards a car parked there and crashed into it, \"falling to the ground and remaining lying down\".  .\n\n It was these injuries that led to his death.\n\n The president of the court stressed that we were not dealing with \"a defendant who belongs to the delinquency\".  It was about a student who had been involved in a fight with other students and that a \"punch assault resulted in a death he neither intended nor intended.\"\n\n The judgment underlines that the two defendants have no criminal record and are well integrated socially and economically.  In the case of Anas, he has \"parents who protect him in everything and are an example in how they accompanied him in all circumstances\".  And the judge pointed to the fact that the mother had moved to Portugal to be closer to her son.\n\n In its indictment, the Public Ministry (MP) had already abandoned the qualifier of aggravated murder, asking that the defendant be sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison for bodily harm, aggravated by the result of death.\n\n While Mr. Jelali has since been released, Mr. Kataya has been detained in Portugal.",
