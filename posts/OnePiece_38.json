I'm curious as to what the story behind this is? And then why all of a sudden it went back to normal. For me it was quite unsettling because I was high while watching it and the sudden change in quality was very jarring. I thought I was going crazy. So I'm just wondering does anyone know the story behind this?",

        "author": "JaysonLloyd",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11eyvvq/how_many_more_power_ups_do_you_think_each_straw/",
        "text": "I‚Äôm really not too sure how some of the characters could get even more powerful. How do you guys see it playing out? Here are my predictions for how each Straw Hat can/will ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù. Warning: major spoilers for Wano and up. \n\nLuffy: after &gt;! awakening his DF/unlocking gear 5, I‚Äôm not too sure where he goes from here. It doesn‚Äôt seem like he has full control on his awakening yet, so I‚Äôm assuming that EOS Luffy will likely have full control over his Nika form. I do not believe we will see a 6th gear, and that Luffy will receive one more major power up. !&lt;\n\nZoro: I think that with zoro, we will likely just see more power attacks after he &gt;! obtained Enma and unlocked conquerors haki. !&lt; I think we will see at least a few new moves that could put him at the level of Mihawk. I see him gradually improving his skill up until he faces Mihawk rather that getting one giant boost. \n\nSanji: &gt;! Sanji‚Äôs genetic awakening completely changes his potential in my opinion. I could totally see him receiving some sort of tech upgrade with the help of Franky to replace his Raid Suit. I see him actually receiving a couple of boosts caused by his recent glow up in Wano before we hit the end of the series. Advanced armament? !&lt;\n\nJinbe: Jinbe has been a Straw Hat for such a short amount of time that I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs gonna be about him gaining strength so much as it‚Äôs gonna be about him showcasing abilities that haven‚Äôt been revealed to us yet. I could see him unlocking  COC. \n\nRobin: I think that she could actually end up awakening her devil fruit abilities at the end of this series. I think her power is very downplayed, and that she could receive a few major boosts. This is even after she unlocked a few new abilities in Wano. I could see her being able to use basic armament haki, too. \n\nBrook: I think that Brook will potentially be able to use observation haki before the series ends. He has already shown extremely increased control over his devil fruit abilities post time skip, so I think that we‚Äôve seen most of his peak; I expect that most of his strength to just grow at a steady pace rather than a major growth at once. \n\nFranky: I think that Franky will receive the most boosts in strength before the end of the series. With Vegapunk potentially giving access to greater technology or improvements, Franky could prove to be a series threat to many high tier characters. His strength has seemed a little stagnant post time skip, so I hope the ship is righted before the Straw Hats hit the end. \n\nChopper: I don‚Äôt really see Chopper unlocking anything super crazy in terms of combat skills, especially after improving the Rumble Ball. The most I see in terms of improvement would likely be more in the medicinal department than combat ability. He seems to have been made into a mascot more than anything at this point (not to downplay his strength!)\n\nNami: After obtaining Zeus in her Clima-Tact, Nami‚Äôs attacks will likely grow stronger as she learns to better control her newfound power. This is similar to Zoro with Enma. I don‚Äôt expect a Haki awakening or DF consumption. \n\nUsopp: I think that Ussop could potentially end up consuming a DF before the series ends. Considering that Elbaf is a real possibility for the Strawhats, I could see Ussop wanting to impress Yassop/the brave Giants and consuming a devil fruit to boost his strength; I also expect him to strengthen his observation haki, though it‚Äôs been a while since we‚Äôve seen him use it. He definitely will receive a few upgrades before it‚Äôs all said and done. \n\nWhat do you guys think? What type of abilities/strengths do you think the crew gets before we reach Laughtale?",

Straw hats and Laboon. The crew keeping their promise to return to Laboon and now even with Brook - the one who promised to meet him again long time ago will be really emotional.\n\n7. Zoro and Mihawk. Zoro fighting his former master and beating will be one of the best moments in One Piece.\n\n8. Zoro and his former teacher from East Blue. Cant wait to see the teacher's reaction when Zoro comes back after he had fulfilled his and Kuina's dream.\n\n9. Usopp and Buggy.

Considering the personalities of the original members, Luffy and Zoro both don't really talk about the past. Nami, Sanji, and Chopper will talk about it if asked. Usopp will talk about it even if you don't ask, but the adult members are good at detecting lies, so they usually get information from Nami, Sanji, and Chopper.**\n\n&gt; Q: In chapter 1045, \"Next Level\", Kaido says \"emonogatari\" (an illustrated story). does that mean that manga don't exist in the world of One Piece? Wait?! Has Kaido never read \"OnePiece\" before?\n\n**Oda: \"Picture books\" and \"illustrated stories\" do exist in One Piece. Picture books are just picture books, but think of illustrated stories as the manga in the world of One Piece. Since there is no concept of speech bubbles, the story is told through text and dialoque within a frame, similar to manga. Some famous titles in the One Piece world include: \"Sora, Warrior of the Sea\", \"Fire Dog\", \"Pokeemon\", \"Monkey Ball\", and \"Marco-san\".**\n\nThere are various other titles as well.\n\n*****\n\nAlso feel free to ping me if new info is revealed.",

        "text": "To start off, this is just a random theory, that might not have any sense at all, but judging how this series is considered to be light-hearted and even the last island is called laugh tale, there's even a very very small chance that this paradox will turn out true, and Oda may have been trolling us since the beginning.\n\n1st: The Strawhat Crew Will Travel to the Past and Leave their Legacy On The Last Island. Idk how, but since we're in egghead island right now and vega punk have knowledge about lineage factors and creating artificial df's, he may have joined the strawhats in their journey till the strawhats wins on their battle with the blackbeard pirates. He may have created a df contrast to toki, which can make a person go back in time. And df contrast to doc. Q that can cure diseases and so on...\n\nZoro is the 1st samurai who built Wano country, Zoro is the Ancestor of ryuma not Ryuma being the Ancestor of Zoro. Reason why oda said on an sbs that ushimaru is not zoro's father, but he's still related to zoro\n\nUssop's lie coming true, since he already saw what happened in the future from his adventures.\n\nChopper is the Ancestor of mink tribe. And will create the medicine to all diseases after defeating doc. Q\n\nNami is the creator of sky ƒ∞sland and the map of the one piece world, but she didn't draw its full details on the whereabouts of one piece and other treasures, since she's stingy.\n\nFranky built the ancient weapon pluton and all the advance technology in the OP world that Vega Punk studied in the future\n\nRobin is the creator of the ancient langguage inscribed on the poneglyphs \n\nJinbe is the creator of Fish man Island after knowing they will be discriminated in the future and he's also the 1st to teach fishmen the fishman karate to defend themselves from abductors, him and franky also created Noah's Arc.\n\nBrook is the creator of the cheerful song Bink Sake üé∂ so the future sailors can sing it through bad times at sea( also a paradox on what he experienced on the florian triangle)\n\nSanji is the indirect ancestor of Lunarian's, the lunarian race may have already been there, but sanji taught them how to make fire out from their body\n\nLuffy Created the devil fruits by his Nika God Form, by the use of the eve tree in elbaf(?)\n\nAnd at the end of their journey, on the Laugh Tale, we see the treasure One Piece, which is a Bronze Meat Statue, it is the Treasure of Luffy, who prefers bronze statues over gold, and beside the statue a poneglyph with messages inscribed from the future strawhats, wrote all of their impossible adventures, and below a name and signature who referred to himself as joyboy is written, which robin suggested.\n\nSo after roger found what the one piece is, he just laugh and he wished he could met joyboy.\nI know this theory sounds stupid, but i just wanna share the laughter i got from this idea.",

        "text": "I know this is just a bad take and people will get mad at me but hear me out.\n\nSo we know that Oda is a fan of using similar themes on a character, what if since Luffy couldn't save his brother (Ace) we have a scenario where Sabo either is controlled or Luffy is and they are forced to fight with the end result of Luffy killing Sabo. \n\nAce dies in front of Luffy against his will, Sabo is killed by Luffy against his will.\n\nSince Sabo picked up the Mera Mera no Mi from Ace what if when Sabo dies (my guess is the government releasing Doflamingo and controlling these Luffy and Sabo against each other in revenge for Dressrosa where they were both present) Luffy finally eats the Mera Mera no Mi picking up the will of both his brothers (presumably during or after the Blackbeard fight and learning how to hold 2 devil fruits successfully from him) and the final fight being against the government or more importantly akainu for getting revenge for Ace. Luffy would finally have a logia style fruit and he would be a huge force to reckon with and a true joy boy sun god.\n\nAlso if you need more convincing it would make sense that since Ace had Mera Mera no Mi first (the first to show up on the island and oldest orphan of the 3 brothers) then Sabo gets it (the 2nd to show up and oldest orphan) then Luffy would get it last being the youngest and last on the island.",

        "text": "\n# Theory: Caribous swamp harbors a \"parasite\" that controls him from the inside.\n\n## **Why is this theory important now?**\n\n- Caribou is present at Egghead island.\n- The frontier Dome is completely isolated to the outside \"sealed mode\"\n- But the infinite storage Capacity of Caribous swamp allows to transport \"traitors\" and \"assasins\" into the dome without prior notice\n- with Caribou as the original parasite carrier this could develop similar to science fiction horror movie Alien, where dead colonists are serving as incubators for an alien \"hunter\" creatures reproduction\n\t- one indication of the horror route Oda is going with egghead: the glass capsules with weakened CP - members inside them [chp. 1076], treating humans like cattle, inside glass boxes ...\n\t- splitting the strawhat crew into small groups, and having Nami cry for help from afar\n\n## **The Importance of Caribou**\n\nIt is really weird how Oda gives a seemingly unimportant character like Caribou so much screen time and knowledge since the beginning of the post timeskip.\n- he knows about Poseidon and Pluton\n- he has infiltrated the straw hats ship and Wano\n- he has an extremely long and detailed cover story during the Dressrosa arc\n- his disgusting slimy persona, and swampy power seems to be Odas attempt at creating disgust and \"Horror\", but for now Carribou is plenty stupid, very weak and we dont know what kind of dangers he carries inside his swamp.\n\n&gt; So he had all of this stuff stashed away in that swamp-like Body of his ... ~Zoro, chapter 651\n\n- well, Zoro ... besides the treasure there also was a Gatling gun and a scythe that you never saw[chapter 652].\n\n## Theory\n\nCaribous ability allows him to store **living things** and food, the two things needed to supply a parasite or warrior living inside him.\n- sidenote: Caribou still should have Scotch inside of him -- one of Kaidos men he absorbed in the cover story of chapter 721\n\nWhat I am saying here is that Caribou is just a slimy ... or swampy shell for something much more horrific and stronger hiding in the swamp INSIDE Caribou. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoP_47575c  Someone who sees and hears everything what Caribou does, an extremly  competent assasin. Caribou himself feels free, is not directly controlled all times but rather \"nudged into the right direction\" sometimes by that force that lives inside him -- similar how parasites nudge snails to be eaten by predetors.\n\nIn chapter 946 Caribou talks about how the signaling between snails work. This leads to the question: How smart is Caribou, is his mind controlled by someone sometimes?\nNote: His eyes are shaded while his **eyes are not double ringed** in that scene, sweating, while he gives that unusualy smart explaination. -- A man who does not know about Haki in the new world \n\nHe looks very similar to revolutionary Gaburu. This leads to the following hypothesis:\n- **Revolutionary** Gaburu was captured by the World Government because of his revolutionary activities and his body retrieved by them (in chapter 731 we see Gaburus grave is on a metal island where **no corpse** can be dug, meaning Gaburus body is somewhere else) \n- they healed Gaburu but his personality and soul became evil and twisted, during the torture they put him through\n- his will broke and he became a completely different person, a stupid carrier agent to infiltrate the pirate world without much (similar to Stussy but on the evil side)\n- they infected him with a parasite that lives inside Caribous swamp comfortably of unlimited food supply inside the swamp, controlling him from the inside sometimes, in vital moments mostly to have a spy into the pirates of the new world.\n- his body still looks similar to Gaburus, thats why Gaburus grandmother recognized the husk in chapter 690 and rescued him, but she noticed her grandson is already dead / his previous will was broken and replaced\n\nThe parasite does not care for Caribous feelings or his wounds, as he is repeatedly defeated and hurt, but never killed while he travels through the new world. Only if Caribou dies the parasite will be revealed.\nCaribou follows the straw hats for fishmen island, interested in :\n\n&gt; Killing them all from the **inside**! (chapter 603)\n\n- interesting statement for someone who can harbor a parasite in his swamp, who controls him from the **inside**, and always listens.\n\nhe is also interested in the ancient weapons, spying in on conversations about Pluton.\n\n&gt; There is a certain someone who would love to hear about this!! [Chapter1056]\n\n- if that certain someone was the parasite who lives inside him, he already heard about it, laughing his ass off about Caribous stupidity\n\nCaribou was described by Luffy as a wild beast in Fishmen castle [chapter 650] , maybe referring to the beasts hiding inside the swamp rather than Caribou himself.\n\n----\n\n## What is the beast hiding inside caribou?\n- not a question that this theory attempts to answer, just want to show the possibilities of Caribous swamp and the danger that creates.\n- propably a Zoan of something that lives in the swamp and mud, Sankes, Snails, Fish, slimy animals, insects, eal, leeches\n\t- this theory was inspired by this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=manUdOCIUN0, describing Imus right hand asassin was ... a Hagfish. Smh it gave me the dark distrubing horror vibes to come even up with this ...  But the conclusions is unrelated!\n- to create a twist: propably way stronger then Caribou himself, capable of using all kinds of Haki, a skilled assasin who can hide his presence and is hyper intelligent\n\nTlDr: Something weird is going with and inside Caribou. Someone is hiding in him.",

Shouldn't Sanji also got KOed and rest for a week too?\n\nWhy is this happening/what do you think Oda meant by this?\n\n- That Luffy and Zoro is in another level than Sanji? Like, these duo are the power duo.\n\n- Is it because of Exoskeleton's healing and regen?\n\nWe know muscles got stronger by being broken and rejuvenated. Their one week sleep can imply that their strength is upgraded a lot. \n\n---\n\n\n\"Sanji didn't take that much of damage\" is a good reason, but remember that he is also not as durable/strong as Luffy and Zoro for most of the fight (before Exo). So the damage he took is like in proportion to his pre-Exo strength.\n\nThe focus on both Luffy and Zoro during that wake-up scene did seem like a special treatment for both, and I wonder why.",

We don‚Äôt see Blackbeard receiving as much hype as Shanks is though, and this guy is the most likely candidate for a final villain compared to Shanks, who is likely more of a lore-related character. \n\nIt‚Äôs been proven that attractive people are more likely to succeed in life and receive positive feelings (support, reassurance, etc.) from those around them, and I was wondering if that applies to characters. Compared to his yonko peers, he‚Äôs a human dilf who‚Äôs obviously going to stick out with a big ass fish guy, a 15 foot burly man, and a circular woman.\n\nAssuming everything was the same in the story of One Piece, aside from Kaido and Shanks swapping designs, would Shanks receive the same amount of love and hype? I mean, the guy hasn‚Äôt really done anything until now, so there‚Äôs not much reason to have him as a favourite character unless there‚Äôs a level of attraction right?

For example one character shouldn‚Äôt randomly do something with no explanation, like Zoro shouldn‚Äôt randomly make his swords Black Blades mid fight)\n\n- Length (This would get coupled with pacing but I think a lot of people would not like this fight to be 1 chapter long even if it‚Äôs paced well. Let‚Äôs hope it can make it to 2 chapters by some miracle)\n\n- Tension (Supposedly Oda has already failed to make anyone care about Zoro‚Äôs dreams so no one cares whether Zoro achieves it. And the alternative is to have there be Life or death stakes in this fight which is unlikely since Oda doesn‚Äôt kill anyone. And lastly there is no animosity between these two. So I think we can give tension a 0% right now)\n\nAnd whatever else you care about. Like do you need both Zoro and Mihawk‚Äôs backstories? Do you need to see Zoro‚Äôs training in the time skip? Do you need to know about Zoro‚Äôs eye? Do you need Oda to finally explain Ashura? Does Oda have to maybe also explain what ‚Äúswordsmanship‚Äù even means?
