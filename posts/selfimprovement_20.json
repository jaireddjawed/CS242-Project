        "text": "Hi, \n\nLong story short, I am coming from a chaotic family enviorenment/anger issues and maybe undiagnosed narcisstic disorder in my brother who was the one mostly raised me. In my past relationship, I was choosing chaos over peace, trying to hurt when they hurt me, I was lashing out, name calling, and had huge trust issues. I do not know but mix of therapy/reading/journaling and maybe getting older (lol) I do not have most of these. My current (and ex as of last week) relationship was the first chance to test myself out. \n\nI honestly caught myself much more peaceful/calm/understanding like we had zero fights. There were two incidents the old me kind of took over and they were the ones kind of made him doubt but honestly if he saw old me probably was running and giving me restraining order if he is doing for them haha. Another thing I am thinking, I might have become too much conflict avoidance or too forgiving but anyway.\n\nThe two incident was accusing him of something and getting upset with him. One I was not rude at all, second was jealousy I think I was rude in that one and I even felt the dark voice/old me took over but just could not stop. \n\nI wanted to ask do you catch these moments after the self work? How do you explain them to your partner? Saying stuff like yeah that was old me taking over is weird, saying that was my normal is also not right and I do not want to lose him for something I am also not fan of already and working on.  \n\nSimilar thing happened last week, we already had plans but he wanted to have laid back weekday night before weekend. It was okay, I randomly wanted to manipulate him felt like it is always him making the final decision, like two minutes later I am already realizing it is absurd but I have just made the stupid comment already. In that moment, I am also realizing the dark voice/old me taking over. That is new, is that trigger moment or something?  Do you have similar experiences? How do you explain them to other people without looking crazy haha",

I've tried the advice I was given and have been working towards it and trying to talk to more people and just be more social. But every day it seems like it is very pointless. I try to find things people have interest in and things we have in common but it seems like that doesn't even work and it is just making me feel worthless. I downloaded tinder and bumble and other apps and tried to make friends and find a girlfriend and not a single match from a single person. I try everyday to see if it works and even that seems futile. I don't really know anymore. I hate that I'm so alone. I hate that I'm so undatable. I hate everything about myself because at this point, I'm the problem and no matter how hard I try to solve it, it never works. No one just doesn't like me or wants to talk to me. Hell, even on here, trying to make a friend, they just ghost you after a day or two, yet they beg for friends. So I think I'm the problem. I'm really tired of being here and being alive. I don't want to anymore. I can't gain confidence, I don't feel happy. I can't really find anything that makes me happy, I'm trying to work on myself but it doesn't make me feel any better. Only when I think of being dead or dying do I feel like I'm at peace. I hate living here. I hate being alive.",

        "text": "I thought it would be pretty cool to share some of the habits we incorporate into our lives and reflect on what we could do better. We could also share some feedback on how we could improve our habits (I would definitely like some feedback on mine).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContext: I am a high school senior. I have a somewhat busy schedule with involvement in a couple of organizations and advanced classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Habits that are easy for me:**\n\n**-**brushing my teeth\n\n\\-showering\n\n\\-starting my work right away\n\n\\-skincare\n\n\\-logging in my work\n\n\\-having a schedule\n\n\\-finding productive things to do in my freetime\n\nWhenever I'm bored and I know I have some free time, I always try to look for events and opportunities to volunteer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Habits that can be kind of easy for me, but can take some conscious effort**:\n\n\\-busywork/studying/self-learning\n\nOftentimes, I enjoy studying because it's a way for me to learn without pressure from school. The part where it gets tough is feeling like I have too much I want to study. While I try to study for my classes, I also feel the need to do some self-learning for some of my interests outside of school such as public health, bioethics, medicine, and neuroscience. I have this feeling that I'm asking too much to be truly fulfilled and I always feel guilty for studying one thing and not the other haha. I tried learning one subject each day, but for some reason, I don't do well with structure so I would rather go with the flow.\n\n\\-exercise/stretching\n\nI do color/winter guard which is the main physical activity I do right now. Just as a recreational hobby, I do indoor cycling with some indoor cycling videos on YouTube. When I get more time in my schedule, I want to buy a bicycle and travel. If I get more involved in yoga and pilates, I might work on getting certified to become a yoga or pilates instructor for a while. I think where I fail is incorporating stretching into my morning routine because I feel like I never have enough time (on weekdays, I wake up at 5:30 AM and I have to leave by 6:15 AM). Sometimes I don't do it in my night routine either because I get too tired. \n\n\\-drinking water\n\nI usually carry a water jug wherever I go, but I mostly drink it during practice. I think there's a mental blockage in my head that stops me from reaching my water goal because I don't want to constantly go to the bathroom haha\n\n\\-chores\n\nI always feel bad for not doing them as often as I should, but a lot of the time I'm not even home, and home feels like a hotel for me at this point. But I try to do them on the weekends when I can. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Habits that I need to focus on:**\n\n\\-sleeping earlier, waking up earlier\n\nThis is sooo important, but I have such a hard time with this. It can get tough with my schedule because I don't go home until 8:30 PM on weekdays and then after that, I have to shower, eat, and do work. So by the time I'm done, it's 11:30 PM and my night routine actually starts. When I'm about to sleep, I don't like the feeling that I'm about to end my day cause I always feel like there's something to do which makes it harder to sleep. So I end up sleeping around 12-1 AM with 4-5 hours of sleep in total and then wake up miserable and tired. I think I can improve this by meditating and focusing on mindfulness before I sleep as well as just balancing my schedule.\n\n\\-meditation\n\nMindfulness and focus is my biggest weakness because I always feel like my head is running. I think I don't do this because ironically, it feels like it takes a lot of work and I want my night routine to be more relaxed. But hopefully, I can fake it til I make it and do it until it feels natural.\n\n\\-drinking milk every day\n\nThis is something I need to focus on because I am a short, Asian girl and my mom has osteoporosis. A nurse told me that it's important to drink milk and avoid soda because calcium stops growing in women by the time we are thirty. And since I have an increased risk of it due to my background, I need to consider it more. I mostly just drink milk from school, but I don't actually think about it in my day-to-day life. \n\n\\-journaling\n\nI did it for the first month of January and then stopped doing it cause I kept forgetting haha\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know what habits I should incorporate into my life and how I can improve my bad habits and be sure to share your own habits.",

It’s either I see better opportunities of what I could’ve become or see easier jobs paying more then the harder jobs I do. And then I get depressed about how I could’ve done more in high school and gone down a better career path because I didn’t think too much about it back then. The regret just fills up and I can’t control it no matter how much I distract myself. If I work out I think about it, if I watch a movie I think about it, go out with friends laughing I end up thinking about it. Now that everything is going up in price I don’t even know if ill ever get a house. I see my cousins and family have good jobs and doing well in school and have set careers. I’m not jealous of their money, I’m jealous they know what they wanted to do and finished the schooling. I just reapplied to school but don’t even know if I’ll get accepted and if I do I’ll be like 32-33 by the time I’m done lol. I wanna be married before then and what girl is gonna want someone who doesn’t make much or is still in school at 30 with no career. Should I go talk to a therapist or what should I do, I have no idea. I am a catholic so I find rest when I pray but it all still comes back to haunt me when I’m just living my life. I find myself taking longer showers staying up more just sad or crying. My family is supportive and always tell me don’t worry about money or anything. My mom always says “if you start worrying about money in going to just put this house under your name if it stresses you out that much”. They are all supportive but I never tell them anything it’s embarrassing to me. I wanna do something I love, something that will give me a future and pay well and just keep me happy. And I don’t give up, won’t hurt myself or cause any harm. Everyone sees me as such a happy guy and I make people happy and laugh and help others with their problems, but little do they know I’m always dying inside behind the smile. I don’t know where this is going. I guess I just need someone to talk to and give me advice, do I go see a professional or something?  Thanks in advance.",

        "text": "A working list... \n\n1. **Be kind not nice** \\- BE KIND. It's so important. Treat other people in a way that makes your soul feel good. Offer help when you can. Give compliments. Be understanding. BUT RESIST THE URGE TO BE NICE. Don't just tell people exactly what they want to hear. Say nothing if you have to. Take no bullshit and put people in their place when they need to be. Do you really want the best thing people have to say about you to be \"oh, they're nice\"?\n2. **Do things you will remember** \\- \"It's for the plot\"... in a sense. This excludes cruel things and dangerous things, obviously. But at the end of your life, what you have is memories. And think, do you remember every single sunday night where you made dinner and then watched a movie? No. If all you have left at the end if memories, then you're cheating yourself out of memories. Take some risks, and do as much as you can. \n3. **Know when to shut up, and do it** \\- It's ok to not be speaking all the time. Let people say things to you and really try to listen to them. If someone's mad at you, that's ok. Sometimes they have reason and like, that's fine. You're not a horrible person or anything. Let them say their piece. And figure out how to read a room. It will take you far. \n4. **Ask people questions, and listen to their answers** \\- EVERYONE has a story. Little kids will tell you the funniest things you've ever heard in your entire life. Just simply asking questions and listening to your peers will bring you so much closer together and you will make the most meaningful connections. Make people feel like they can talk to you, and most importantly, be trustworthy. Don't tell people's secrets. Let people talk you and let them trust you for good reason. \n5. **Take care of your body** \\- this is not about weight or if you're ugly or anything!!! Drink water, exercise, eat the veggies and also eat the chips, stretch, maintain your hygiene. Show compassion to your body because it does so much for you. It deserves all those things because it is powerful. The hygiene one is a big one, be clean, wear clean clothes, brush your teeth. \n6. **Just do it once** \\- try everything. Because if you hate, it never do it again and don't even give it a second thought. Try all the foods, all the sports, meet all the people etc. Because you will probably hate a lot of it but you really never know. I was so sure that I was just NOT an athletic person, and that I was an artist but I joined my school's marathon training club just because I saw a flyer. I told myself to go on runs with them for just a month - give just a month and then I would quit. And I did end up quitting! I found super long distance incredibly boring, but I found my love for cross-country and I joined my school's cross country team. Then, I joined soccer, And then I joined track and field. Now I find so much passion in sports and even though I quit the marathon club, I found activities that I really loved. \n7. **Be sparkly** \\- doesn't have to be literal. For me, it is, because I love to wear a ton of jewelry. But find a way to decorate your life. Cover your walls in posters of things you love. Wear the makeup that makes you feel happy. Avoid sad beige life at all costs. \n8. **Show respect to authority, but NEVER fear them** \\- You know exactly the kind of authority I'm talking about... the teachers, bosses, parents, that feed off of fear. DO NOT GIVE IT TO THEM! Show respect to them, always. Don't talk back or give attitude, do what is asked of you. When they ask you a passive-aggressive question, or try to shame you for something, respond with reason and understanding. Someone yells at you, saying \"You did this wrong!\" respond with. \"I'm sorry. I guess I understood. Do you want me to redo it or should I just correct it next time?\" Someone yells at you, do not yell back. Do not ignore it. Do not talk back. Speak maturely, ask questions. It takes all their power and will put them back in their place.",

        "text": "Hey guys, first of all, thank you in advance for reading this because I feel it may be long. \n\nSo, I recently came out of probably the worst two years of my life. Filled with anxiety and depression and just a whole roller coaster of emotions. I had never experienced anxiety or depression before so it took some time for me to even realize the situation that I was in. After going to therapy for some time and REALLY making my mental health a priority, I can finally say I feel like I am out of the rabbit hole and I am very proud of myself. Having death/health anxiety is something I would never wish on anyone, even the worst people in the world. Prior to this, I was in the best shape of my life, had been training for years consistently, my diet was also very good for years on end. The gym was my passion and I loved everything about it, it took years of sacrifice and an endless amount of time and effort to build the physique I had. Alongside the gym, I had many other good habits. Cardio, my hygiene, reading books, eating healthy and eating at home, etc. \n\nNow that I’m finally on the other side of the tunnel, it is so hard for me to get back into these things. I gained 50 lbs in the past ten months, and I’m in the worst shape of my life. My hygiene is also probably the worst it’s ever been. I tried working out this week and it kills me how much progress and strength I’ve lost, it is as if I never trained in my life.\n\nI guess to make this as short as possible, for anyone who’s ever gone through a similar experience, how did you start to get back into good habits? Even though I feel like a ton of bricks have finally been lifted off my shoulders, I still can't seem to get back into the good/healthy habits I once had, and I really want to be the best version of myself I can possibly be.\n\nThank you for reading this, and for anyone who’s going through a hard time, I promise you will reach the end of the tunnel. You will learn so much about yourself and this world as I have, and I genuinely believe in my favorite verse. Romans 8:18: For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.",

It just keeps popping up in my mind, almost daily. Also, for some reason, if the person apologizes and is genuinely sorry, that makes all the anger go away very quickly. \n\nI’ve gotten quite lucky in real life, not many people have insulted me, so I’m actually not holding a grudge against anyone IRL. The few grudges I’m holding are actually against people on Reddit, who have said rude things to me on forums. The Reddit users said these things to me months ago, and I’m still thinking about it for some reason. It still pops in my mind almost daily, and I get reminded of it whenever I see anything that uses the same type of wording. I’ve been insulted on Reddit several times, but these two instances pop out for some reason. I think the reason is because those insulting comments were actually upvoted, and my attempts to defend myself were downvoted. \n\nI know full well that this isn’t normal, and most people would have easily let it go a long time ago. That’s the exact reason I made this post, I don’t want to get focused on such little things for so long. Any help?\n\nAlso, the posts with the comments are lost to time, so I can’t link them unfortunately.",

        "author": "tom4tto",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/11cshta/long_rant_atheist_loving_religion/",
        "text": "I am an atheist who sees value in religion, I can only speak for Christianity and a bit of Buddhism because I have learnt from them, feel free to share some insights from other religions too. \n\nThe big 3 takeaways\n\n1. Dealing with self hate and guilt:\n\nA core concept of Christianity is salvation, that all your sins are forgiven and you can go to heaven when you repent and believe that Jesus died for your sins, they also call it “grace”, there is “grace” whenever we sin. \n\nIt tells us how to be more patient with ourselves and that there is nothing inherently wrong with ourselves. Our actions and thoughts do not always define who we are. If there is something we hate about ourselves or something we did, we should first be aware of it and accept that we are a work in progress and work on ourselves (repent) instead of wallowing in self pity and allow it to happen (treating grace as a license to sin, a misconception of Christianity).\n\n2. Dealing with stress and anxiety\n\nBuddhism teaches detachment and mindfulness which we actually see in general spirituality. To detach isn’t to feel less but actually, to be mindful and present in your thoughts and emotions that you experience them closely instead of suppressing them. This gives you an extra perspective to situations, you start to let go of all the “What ifs” and control we are tempted to have. A lot of stress and anxiety comes from trying to control things, the future and also the past where we feel like we could have done something better. Instead, being mindful and surrender the control which we cannot have. This also aligns with Christianity, Matthew 6:34 says “Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.” \n\nSimilarly, Proverbs 3:5-6 says: “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; all your ways submit to Him, and he will make your paths straight.” This is a bit harder to get. But if you look at it as trusting the Lord, as trusting the universe, trusting the process, letting things play out and surrendering control (submit to Him) instead of leaning on our own understanding (trying to rationalise and control everything based on how we believe things should or could work out). In reality, we can’t always have control, situations and coincidences play out, there may or may not be a high power, I don’t think there is personally but it’s like the school of fish in Nemo forming complex behaviours (making shapes) as a whole unit, even though it isn’t 1 entity controlling their group behaviour, it’s all the little behaviours of how each fish relates to one another that gives rise to the larger result. We may not always predict things because there are too many factors that determine a single outcome.\n\n3. Idea of immortality and purpose\nAs an atheist I actually believe this is possible. I remember there was this movie Troy starring Brad Pitt as Achilles invading Troy, he gave a speech about immortality to his men before the battle. What he was talking was immortality by being remembered. Our actions, our deeds, our memories we gave others, will outlive our bodies, truly. This is why a lot of cultures place emphasis on how we act, religions do also. Sometimes you need to behave if not you can’t live forever in a heaven (Christians  also teaches “grace” so you have room to make mistakes). It doesn’t mean we have to do something species changing like great scientists like Isaac Newton. But it can be as simple as making someone’s day. Even if your name is forgotten, your actions may have changed them to take certain actions differently, maybe to make someone else’s day, who in turn makes another person’s day, etc. The cascading effect down generations may have been caused by something you did too. Helping people is fulfilling, and discovering your purpose that resonates with you, that you can show the world something you truly believe in, that you know can make an impact to others and to yourself. Yes I do believe as humans we our purpose is often tied to helping others, not just directly like healthcare workers but also solving the world’s problems through engineering, arts, a business entrepreneur, etc, as we can really live on after death by changing the world together.\n\nI am writing this because recently I also watched Vikings and a quote by Ragnar also impacted me, and he has loads of them, I love his character. One of it was “I hope one day your God and our gods can become friends”, I hope that all gods big or small G can become friends and we as believers or non believers do not have to hate each other and be involved in endless emotional debates. What we want to believe makes our reality and we can keep an open mind. I understand that religion is sensitive because so many people are tired of being hard sold or even challenged again and again, but nevertheless, if we keep an open mind, there is probably something we can gain from them because general spirituality is good and flexible, but the wisdom in religions have a clear structure and direction, not to mention often centuries upon centuries of studies, by combining both we might learn more and be better individuals.\n\nThis post might get deleted because well, religion and people may get sensitive, but please hear me out. These are just my thoughts and I may have misinterpreted stuff and be wrong, I would like to hear anything feedback too though. Recently, I’ve been thinking and reflecting about religions because I have several religious friends who I cant connect fully with. However, I’ve begin to see how religions can teach me so many self improvement strategies that is related to the usual strategies we are familiar with.\n\nI am an agnostic atheist, meaning I do not believe in a god but I am open to the fact that I might be wrong. The reason is it’s impossible to prove or disprove something like that because we are talking about the realm of spirituality, we can’t measure that using today’s technology. We don’t even understand our own consciousness, when do the atoms and brain matter end up leading to our perception of reality? But I am not willing to plunge into religion as I cannot believe in flying deities or a God in the sky who loves us just because someone told me about it, I value logic and actually knowing rather than blind faith. Anyway, usually people believe in a religion and all that comes with it (some higher entity with powers) because of the way their lives changed which is the main topic.",

I am barely pushing on some days and i just wanna  express my emotions to someone on an intimate level. I dont want one  night stands i dont derive any pleasure from that. The whole inside me  grows by the day and even if search for a gf now i know it will come out  of desperation rather than having the time to genuenly know the  potential partner even if i wanted to. Everything is going to feel  rushed because of the lack of time due to my priorities. The saddest  part is i know that there are thousands of other men in the same  position like me.",

I lifted my feet up and strightened my body and started pulling up on the bar. Then I saw the top of the door frame pass before my eyes! I had lifted my first chin up. I managed to do about 3 of them before I fatigued but to me being able to do these small number of chin ups is a real sign of progress towards greater strength. \n\nAchieving that made the march of progress real to me and has reinvigorated my willingness to continue training and progressive overloading.

Figure out who you are. You are not your name given to you by your parents and you are not your parents. You will never be your parents. Believe me, you are your own entity.\n2. Figure out what you want. Ask yourself this question sincerely. It may not come to mind immediately. It may take some time. It may be more than one thing. That's expected. When you discover what it is that you want and you decided to make it your reality then your current hollow life will suddenly become filled with **purpose.**\n\n**Purpose** is the magic wand. It may be the cure to cancer, too.\n\nOnce you start to feel a sense of purpose, trust me, it will eradicate all of these feelings of being lost. It will empower every fiber of your being. You will not remember what it was like to not feel empowered and know who you are. I call this path \"the Narrative.\" Once you get on to this path, it will take to the wildest places and you will meet the most amazing people. It's hard to explain, but you will meet people that you were suppose to meet. Mark my words; Everyone who is breathing air into their lungs at this very moment is worthy of this power and can make this happen. Set a little time aside today and buy a composition book to journal your thoughts to help you make this happen.\n\nLastly,\n\nForgive yourself.\n\nYou already have everything you need.\n\nBest,\n\nduke of who knows where",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my journey towards increasing my productivity and getting my work done. It's been quite a process, I am note quite there yet; but I'm happy to say that I've enjoyed this process however I would love to hear some of your views as I am finalising and perfecting system that works well for me.\n\nInitially to start with I started with Pen &amp; Paper challenges for Journaling. This was an amazing experience, which I was avoiding for long time as I was always pro-technology. So this lasted from initial 90 to 280 days. However, I found that it wasn't enough to keep me on track. Now I wanted to plan better and for longer periods. \n\nIt was hard process, trying out different software over the years because I could never stick to anything for very long. I would only manage to stick to certain platforms due to obligations, like using OneNote for notes and collaboration in university.\n\nEventually, I moved to Notion, which allowed me to keep track of my ideas, brainstorming, planning, and journaling for about 400 days. I also was keep using Yellow Legal pads for brainstorming and I also started using a timing app, which I used intensively daily for about 120 days to learn about how I spent my time and occasionally and situationally for the rest. I would then API this data into my Notion.\n\nHowever, I soon found myself overwhelmed with the amount of information I had on Notion. It was great to have it all there, but even though I made it work, the software was not designed for that much and so Notion was not capable of managing everything to such an extent. So, I started thinking about what I should change.\n\nI began using Obsidian for notes and brainstorming (Canvas was great), DevonThink for files, websites, and PDFs, and Notion for journaling, vision, goals, projects, tasks and calendar (API to iCalendar).\n\nAt this point I then realised that I need to stop looking for the perfect tools, and just use what I have, which is a full apple eco system. I recently, borrowed from my sister an iPad, and I love it! I've been using it heavily over the last two weeks and found that I can have what I loved about journaling but also have it organized down to the files level. \n\nI've been using Notes, Nebo, and Freeform, which have been fantastic for me. I've also loved being able to highlight PDFs and much more. But now I am considering of using my iPad as if it were a journal. It's a new approach, but I'm excited to see how it goes.\n\nI really liked the fact that I was able to do everything from inside Notion, but I am not sure if it is worth long-term. Notion also does not work well with iPad and Apple Pencil and this seem to be quite important for me now, because I loved this in Journaling and using Legal Pad however I did not like that this information was then getting lost on paper and I think it was great that it taught me that I can actually do it, as I struggled for very long time. But now think I need to make some big changes to simplify my Productivity set up and rather than using Notion for almost everything. I want to break it into apps that are actually designed for it, and most importantly, can benefit of being able to use it cross device. So I am looking for apps to manage the following:\n\n1.  Journaling\n\n2.  Notes\n\n3.  To-Do\n\n4.  Calendar\n\n5.  Habit &amp; Life Track\n\n6.  Ideas\n\n7.  Brainstorming\n\n8.  Saving Websites from Research.\n\n9.  Notes from Kindle Books &amp; Audiobooks.\n\n10.  Goals &amp; Project Management\n\nI think Apple – Files, Notes, Calendar, Freeform might do the trick from Apple Side, but concerned with the rest. I was looking into Day One/Stoic and Omni Things / Things 3 and maybe use notion for Project Management &amp; Goals.\n\nI really would love to hear your thoughts on this or any productivity tips that have worked well for you. Thanks for reading!",

I feel if I don’t pick one thing and focus all my time into it then one of 2 things may happen, either I become mid and eventually just bad at all of these things and end up with a random 9-5 or a “good job” like a doctor or an engineer because of my academics or if I create a super strict schedule stricter than my current schedule (current one limited because of school and the IB diploma) I could become above average at all of these things but not extraordinary at any of them and still possibly end up with a job I don’t like because of my indecisiveness.\n\nI fear being another former “gifted kid” turned burnt out adult with random job.\n\nAnother issue is I feel a deep sense of loneliness and can’t seem to get much done when I’m not around others and seem to 10x my productivity when I am around people trying to achieve what I’m trying to achieve, which is strange because I used to like being alone, now I hate it\n\nBut it’s starting to seem more and more likely that if I want to excel at anything that I have to stick to a lonely repetitive strict schedule everyday, and I just think that that would be a shame as there’s so much more to life than just the pursuit of excellence.\n\nIf you read this far I feel obliged to thank you for your time 😅\nHopefully this helps some people and not just myself",

I like the fact that I moved out of my hometown to pursue my studies, especially in a place where the language is unknown because I believe growth is achieved outside my comfort zone\n\nBut there are things that bothers me every moment of life, hence taking away my focus from studies.\n\nI was an introvert in school as well as college. Didn't talk to a lot of people, didn't enjoy going out, wasn't social at all, etc. Due to this I missed out a lot in those years which I regret a lot. Although I have worked on myself in the last 3 years and become so much better that nobody wants to believe that I'm actually an introvert and not an extrovert. I had a lot of plans and dreams with MBA when it comes to extra curricular activities, but none of it is going to happen as the curriculum doesn't let us gel with the other departments and take part in activities.\n\nI've been single my whole life. Never had a girlfriend. Never really worked out for me. I think I'm someone who is at that stage of life personality wise where women find me attractive and they talk to me. But still with all the talking and going out with them. I still end up rejected. I see couples in my campus and it saddens me a lot. I require intimacy and companion. The girls I've been associated with earlier, most of them have always been the ones to make the first move, but it never goes anywhere.\n\nEveryday feels the same. There's nothing much to do here. The fact that this is enough motivation to work hard and get a good job after 2 years kind of makes me worry that this is going to make the way towards me becoming materialistic. Lately I have been introspecting and I come to know that I think money matters the most, people are just a part of life, they'll come and leave so I should use them as much as I can, etc. This really bothers me cause I don't want to become that shallow and materialistic of a person.\n\nI just wanna be happy and experience things that most people can normally do, like studying, getting good grades, dating, sports, etc.",

Somehow I got the feeling I screwed up. she knew we were not compatible on only one meeting. I decided I wanted to meet up again but just as friends. Because I genuinely find her a intresseting girl. I Somehow got a feeling that I'm bothering her and she's just being nice to me. What would be the right course of action here?",

        "text": "Money can't buy your success. But who said money is the only form of payment it'll accept? There are 3 prices you must pay if you actually want to reach any goal you set and change your life. And it doesn't matter where or who you are in life. It doesn't matter if you're black, white, Indian, Asian, Mexican – whatever. Doesn't matter if you're broke or suck at everything you do, young, old, fat, skinny, a man or woman – none of that matters. All that matters is you show up and pay the price.  \n\nWhat's the price you must pay that, if you do, it will guarantee your success? Before we dive into that, I want you to understand that the higher your goal, the more expensive it is. Meaning you're going to have to pay a higher cost. \n\nSo don't expect to make a one-time payment and achieve success. Just like you'd be put on a payment plan to gradually chip away at a mortgage, college debt, or even that purse you saw for five easy payments of $79.99, your higher goals also require a payment plan. So don't get discouraged if you pay the 3 prices and nothing's happened. All that means is you've got more payments to make. If you keep showing up to pay the price, you'll chip away at the cost until it's one payment away.\n\nNow, what the heck are the 3 prices you must pay? If it's not money, what is it? \n\n# Price #1\n\nThe first price is effort. If you want to achieve anything meaningful in life, you've got to put in the action and the hard work to get it. But what do most people do? They avoid putting in the effort because, let's face it, it's hard. \n\nIf you want abs, you gotta work for them in the gym and at the table. \n\nIf you want a successful business, you gotta work for it by putting your product or service out there only to get months of nothing.\n\nIf you want to excel in school, you must work for it by hitting the books while your friends hang out. \n\nAnyone can put in the effort, but most people don't. \n\nAnd then you've got the worst type of person (and this was me for many years) who tricks themselves into thinking they're putting in effort, learning, and planning how to reach their goals as much as possible. They think that watching videos, reading books, writing notes, and plan after plan are getting them closer to the finish line when in reality, they haven't even moved. \n\nYou must put in real effort to reach your goals; there's no other way around it. You gotta do the hard work, and you already know what that is. \n\nIf you want a new job, try searching for one, driving there, and asking to speak to the boss about the value you can bring. \n\nIf you're going to write a book, sit down and get to writing. \n\nIf you want a fit body, drop to the floor and do pushups. \n\nStop running from the effort it takes and start embracing it. That's the first cost of success. \n\n# Price #2\n\nThe second cost is pain.\n\nOh, you thought this was gonna be fun, easy, and pleasurable? You thought wrong. Expect pain. Don't be like the majority who run from pain and seek pleasure. Be like the top percent who seek pain as if it were pleasure because they know with pain comes growth.\n\nAnd I'm not talking about the pain of a cut finger. I'm talking about the pain of dealing with the lazy side of you who wants to procrastinate on your goals, who wants you to take it easy, who wants you to give up the second things get uncomfortable. And if you don't listen to this side of you, it'll attack to make sure you do. It'll fill your mind with doubts and make you think you can never make it, that things will never happen, and that you aren't good enough. \n\nIt'll fill you with anxiety, stress, dread, fear, and so much more, all tempting you to quit. The price you must pay is feeling the attacks of your lower self and choosing to push through. \n\nWhen you're on your seventh job interview, you're thinking, \"Man, why am I doing this? My old job isn't even that bad. I should just turn around,\" don't. You said you wanted a new job, so endure the pain it costs.\n\nWhen you're writing or studying for some test, and all you feel is boredom and a burning desire to check your phone and spend hours distracted, don't. Embrace the pain it costs, and stay locked in and focused on your work. \n\nWhen you're on pushup 42 out of 100, and your arms are burning, your mind is saying, \"You've done enough! Chilll, let's stop here.\" Endure the pain it costs and do another pushup, then another until you've shut your mind up because it knows you aren't leaving. \n\nThe pain will always be a cost to pay, and the sooner you accept that fact, the less likely you'll be to run away when it comes. But paying those two costs alone isn't enough because, without this third cost, you'll never achieve your goals. No matter how much effort you put in or how much pain you endure, nothing matters if you don't pay the third cost.\n\n# Price #3\n\nThe third cost is time. And I'm not talking about a short amount of time; I'm talking about months or even years' worth of time. Can you put in the effort it takes and endure the pain for years on end? Or will you be like most people who only give a few weeks, if even that, before giving up or just forgetting what they wanted in the first place and reverting back to old habits? \n\nEverything you see in life came from the result of time. Time is the foundation on which everything stands and if used wrongly, where everything falls. And the thing about time is, it's tricky. It tricks you into thinking the effort you put in and the pain you endure was for nothing over and over again. \n\nYou could be hitting the gym 3x a week and not see a hint of progress. You could be working on a business for months and still not make any money. Heck, you could be doing every single little thing right and have nothing to show for yourself. \n\nAnd even worse, you could eat that box of donuts and not see any difference in your weight. You could lay on the couch all day and still feel relatively healthy. You could never think about the future and have a comfortable present. \n\nAnd then time passes, and its tricks are revealed. If you kept putting in effort and enduring the pain, no matter how many weeks, months, or years it took, you'll be standing 10x better than before.\n\nYou'll have the 10 out of 10 body, a successful business, and everything else you've wanted from life.\n\nBut if you don't pay the price of time and continue showing up for what you truly want, you'll be 10x worse than before. You'll be unhealthy, fat, broke, depressed, and stuck living an average, unfulfilling, pleasure-driven life. \n\nTime works slowly, but it reveals itself with a heavy hand. You want to be on the good side of time because, believe me when I say, it's coming. Either you'll pay the cost of time, or you'll suffer in debt. The choice is yours. \n\n# Bonus Price\n\nEffort, pain, and time are the 3 costs you must pay to guarantee that you'll reach your goals. And as a bonus, I'll tell you a fourth cost.\n\nConsistency. \n\nIf you show up every day for yourself, time will be on your side as it passes. Consistency beats all because who can stop the person who keeps showing up at the doorsteps to their goals, knocking every single day?\n\nNo one can stop them, and eventually, their goals will get tired of their knocking and let them in, if only for some peace and quiet. Be the one who makes your goals give up, don't be the one who walks away.\n\nNow, remember, time is passing anyway. So you might as well start taking action, working on your goals right now.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/11ci9mo/gonna_do_a_1_month_self_improvement_challenge/",
        "text": "I just want to get this out of the way first, in regards to the \"1 month\", I do plan on doing it for longer. But I need to start off with a reasonable yet still difficult goal, and first I'm going to do only 1 month, see how it goes, then adjust and continue. So I'm not going to stop after 1 month, I will continue.\n\nThis post is going to be very long, just as a heads up.\n\nSo recently I have been trying self improvement stuff, but I've never done anything consistently. Often times I find myself going back to my old ways after several days/weeks, so I wanted to try breaking out of that habit. I've come up with a relatively strict plan for myself to hopefully improve my mental and physical health as well as my academics. \n\nThe schedule is a bit different for every day because of rest days from workouts, time that school ends, etc, but in general, here is how it goes:  \nWake up at 5AM, meditate for 10 minutes, drink water, workout, get ready (e.g. brush teeth, take a shower), some free time, then go to school.   \nOnce I get back I do any school work/studying for about an hour, then a 20 minute break, then continue with school work/studying, then eat dinner. Usually after dinner my parents and I watch a few episodes from a TV show, and we usually end around 9pm.   \nSo from 9pm I brush my teeth and go to bed.\n\nI'm also someone who believes in having free time, so I made sure to have quite a bit of free time every day while still having enough time for studying and other things. I've also left a lot of free time for myself on weekends because I don't believe in doing school stuff over weekends. Although sometimes I have to anyway, so I have set some time to do any school work/studying that I need to.\n\nAnd for my workout, I did a bunch of research and found some full body workouts (since I think those will work the best for me) that I can do at home. I'll alternate between 2 different workouts, and have a rest day on Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday. \n\nI'm also going to reduce the amount of screen time I use. I've already cut down on the amount of time I spend on my phone by a lot, but I still end up using it for longer than I'd like to, so I'm going to try to not use my phone at all for anything other than checking messages and the other essential stuff (like timers, calculator, alarm, etc). And I also need to cut down on the amount of time I spend on my computer since I usually spend several hours a day on it and don't do anything productive most of the time. I'm going to try to use social media like YouTube, Reddit, and Discord a lot less (funny how I'm using reddit right now). \n\nAnother thing I'm planning to do is eat healthier too. I already eat pretty healthy since I eat whatever my mom cooks and she cooks healthy meals, but I also tend to eat junk food whenever I'm watching TV shows/movies with my parents. I'm going to try to completely cut out that junk food and replace it with more dinner. I tend to eat and get full quickly, so by the time we start watching stuff I'm usually hungry again. I'm still eating a lot but at least it's healthy food and not junk food. \n\nI do have several concerns for this though. First and foremost I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it consistently. I suck at staying dedicated to things like these, so I'm scared that I will fail again. But I'm going to try anyways, because you can't improve if you don't give it a shot. Second, I don't know what I will do in my free time. Since I can't do what I usually do in my free time (basically just binge YouTube or scroll through Reddit or something), I'll need to look for something else. I'm going to see if I can develop a hobby that I can actually enjoy and that I can still feel rested (mentally) after doing it and not like I've done something that I needed to do. I could try reading some books, but my mind tends to wander after like 30 seconds of reading and I usually take about twice as long as I should have to finish a book. But maybe that was a byproduct of using social media so much, so maybe that condition will get better once I start doing this challenge. I won't know until I start trying.\n\nIn any case, wish me luck guys, I will do my best, and after 1 month I will post an update (if I remember to). I am going to start tomorrow, so the next time I post should be on the 27th of march.",

However, I've found that I often overestimate or underestimate how long they'll take, so I don't think it's a good method.  \n\nI've also tried tracking every minute of my day (used Toggle Track) using this formula: (*number of tasks I completed) / (total productive time)*. However, I've encountered a couple of issues with this approach.\n\nFirstly, I noticed the formula can sometimes motivate me to spend less time being productive since the less time I spend, the higher my productivity score. Obviously, this isn't the goal.  \n\n\nSecondly, different tasks have varying levels of difficulty, and this formula doesn't take that into account. I've thought about using time estimates to factor in difficulty, but not sure about that.\n\nLastly, I've had a hard time deciding what time I can count as productive. \n\nSo, I'm turning to you all for some advice.

        "text": "Hi everyone, for some reason, I (21) suffer from a lot of overthinking, assuming the worst on people. At work, at home, while driving, while in a relationship, for my own self.\n\nSome examples of my way of thinking are like this: \n\nAt work: Whenever I see someone who is talking, not doing much compared to me, and I get annoyed and pissed. I assume that some people may be annoyed at me when they are not interacting with me or have never spoken to me before. I also tend to overdo things due to anxiety of thinking that I might be underperforming and then get mad at myself for *doing too much* compared to other coworkers who are just calmly working.\n\nAt school: I assume similar as when I am at work. I also compare myself to those who cheat and I feel bad because \"it's not okay\", this is not a positive thought at all and I am aware that I should be worrying about myself and no one else.\n\nWhile driving: I always have anxiety from people driving behind me, whenever turning right, or people who tailgate me, I drive an old car, that's older than me, and I feel insecure driving. Again, this is because of my thinking habit.\n\nIn a relationship: Even if everything is going well, I still manage to feel insecure about something and fall in a thinking hole. Afraid of being cheated on, left on, I have been in 3 relationships, and I am aware that I will be totally fine if it ever ends.\n\nAt the gym: This has diminished, but I assume that the fact of me doing exercise in front of a large group of people will make them think that I look weird, or I feel insecure about my own self, my progress compared to others, etc.\n\nI have around 1k in debt for mismanaging my credit cards. I am currently paying them off while working part-time while in college, but I still feel bad about my actions, and I reminisce a lot on my bad actions from the past, I was aware that was not okay prior getting a cc when turning 18. So I knew better, but I still made a mistake.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way? What do you do to cope with life? This is not healthy anymore. I have goals and aspirations, but some of this non necessary thinking gets in the way and it's not okay at all. It does not let you live in peace.\n\nI have tried THC or a marihuana edible. And it has helped diminish my anxiety. However, because of the way I was raised, I do not want to depend on substances for my wellbeing. This may be the origin of another question.",

        "text": " From mindless distractions to letting others think for us, *we don't think for ourselves anymore*.\n\n We keep our minds busy with distractions, or we outsource our thinking to others; becoming products of our consumption, as what we consume shapes our beliefs, opinions, and thoughts; without us critically thinking about and consciously choosing them. It starts to shape our life and character in a way we might not actually want, without us being aware and that we might later regret - *what we don't bring to consciousness appears in our life as fate.*\n\n Are you living the life you want?... You've become someone you are not...\n\n How to **change** this?\n\n Fundamentally, by *thinking more consciously*.\n\n**-** **Pause after consuming content you find valuable**  \n After consuming valuable content, **pause**; let it sink in. Think about it - What did it say? What do you think about it? Argue against yourself and try to go deeper. ***Consuming less information becomes more valuable***.\n\n**- Write a little every day**  \n Writing *is* thinking. Writing extends your memory, facilitates editing, and clarifies your thinking. If you learn to think - to write and edit - you will also be able to tell the difference between good and bad ideas; it **improves** your **judgement** and with it, you will reject lower quality content and consume higher quality content, while knowing what *you* think. Write about problems or things you find important, interesting or valuable.\n\n**- Sit with yourself**  \n Sitting with yourself turns your attention inward, toward yourself. It declutters and organizes your mind, while revealing what ***you*** think and feel; you'll gradually start to feel better, think more clearly, and act more purposeful. You don't want to focus on anything, you just let your mind wander - it's that simple. Though, it's not easy. Sit through the discomfort. Try it out; if you don't think it was worth it, downvote this post.\n\n The more, the better; but you can start by doing just a little each day (e.g. 3 minutes), and gradually increase it :).",

        "text": "Been reading this book for a bit and it's been calling me out in a way that's super depressing.\n\nChapter 2 talks about narcissism. It says that we're all narcissists to a certain degree, but some are so-called \"deep narcissists.\" These people don’t have a stable sense of self, and so they rely exclusively on the outside to give them their approval. If they don’t receive constant attention and/or approval they have a breakdown. “Normal” people, by contrast, have a sense of self (i.e. self esteem) which allows them to cope with not having outside approval. The book makes a very clear point that these people cannot be helped because they lack a stable sense of self - something developed in early childhood when the brain is still developing. I see a lot of the “deep narcissist” traits in myself and it’s depressing to think that I can’t really fix myself. The book says that for everyone else, you should work on empathy and focusing your energy outwards. Maybe I’ll try that too. Get a bit of progress in at least. \n\nChapter 3 discusses body language. There’s a (transphobically written, although still accurate) passage about a trans woman who got identified as trans because of her body language. As a trans person who’s trying to blend in as cis myself, it hurts to be called out like this. At least this one I can kind of work on, but it really called me out in a way I didn’t expect. \n\nChapter 4, which I’m on now, discusses the concept of a person’s core character. Some people have a strong and resilient character by nature, and constantly improve themselves by being able to handle criticism and being secure in their interactions with others. Some have a weak character and falter under pressure and cannot grow because they cannot handle criticism. There’s a kind of spectrum here - everyone has some character flaws but some have stronger characters than others. At the bottom of the spectrum, there’s toxic individuals. One of the toxic archetypes he lists is the personalizer. This passage describes my character almost to the letter, so I’ll paste it here:\n\n&gt;**The Personalizer**: These people seem so sensitive and thoughtful, a rare and nice quality. They might seem a little sad, but sensitive people can have it rough in life. You are often drawn in by this air of theirs, and want to help. Also, they can appear quite intelligent, considerate, and good to work with. What you come to realize later on is that their sensitivity really only goes in one direction—inward. They are prone to take everything that people say or do as personal. They tend to brood over things for days, long after you have forgotten some innocuous comment that they have taken personally. As children, they had a gnawing feeling that they never got enough from their parents—love, attention, material possessions. As they get older, everything tends to remind them of what they didn’t get. They go through life resenting this and wanting others to give them things without their having to ask. They are constantly on guard—are you paying them attention, do you respect them, are you giving them what they paid for? Being somewhat irritable and touchy, they inevitably push people away, which makes them even more sensitive. At some point they start to have a look of perpetual disappointment.\n\n&gt;You will see in their life a pattern of many falling-outs with people, but they will always see themselves as the wronged party. Do not ever inadvertently insult such a type. They have a long memory and can spend years getting back at you. If you can recognize the type early enough, it’s better to avoid them, as they will inevitably make you feel guilty for something.\n\nLike chapter 2, a big part of this chapter talks about how you can’t really change your character, all you can hope to do is be aware of your flaws and patterns and try to mitigate them. \n\nIdk about you guys but this seems kind of… depressing? The message of the book is that you can’t really change who you are as a person, and these toxic personalities that the book describes and that resonate with me will stay with me forever. I guess it’s good to be aware of your flaws so you can mitigate them, but am I really doomed to be stuck with this toxic personality forever, always trying to fight who I am and mitigate the damage that my core character will cause to my life?",

My main problem is not being able to find topics to talk about. I think I'm confident, I look people in the eyes, I listen, I use good body language, and I give feedback, that's it, I cannot start a conversation and keep it going. \n\nI usually ask if they have any hobbies or anything interesting they're working on. We chat for a few minutes about that, then I usually balance it out with my hobbies and projects.\n\nIf they are interested in anything I like, I can extend the conversation to that. For example, the Girl I like is into mixology (mixing drinks and whatnot) so I asked her if I can set up a reservation someday to give her creations a taste. Then I try to balance it out with something interesting from my side, with emphasis on the try, 90% of the time I cannot offer anything useful since my hobbies consist of playing the Electric Guitar, and the Cello, and the occasional video game session with a side of anime.\n\nBesides talking about hobbies, their daily life, and family members, I literally do not know what to say after that, and it usually ends with silence. The girl asked me to drop her off at a family member's house that's an hour away and I'm panicking figuring out what to do to not make the trip and awkward one",

But it doesn't stop my anxiety from telling me to keep it up, and don't slow down.\n\nThe main thing that I am feeling aimless about is my job/career.

I want to switch job paths, but I'm clueless of where to go, or what I would be good at.\n\nThat gets me thinking about school, but that just stresses me out more because I don't know what I want to take, and I don't want to end up paying thousands of dollars for a course I'm unsure about. And going to school will set back my plans for a house, which is something I desperately want. Apartment life is another thing that I feel is eating away at my mental health slowly.

If we are only working hard without actively improving our abilities to handle the challenges of our goals, our efforts will not bear fruit. \n\nWe might feel at times that we want to get promoted or be in a position to guide people or take charge of more responsibilities. However, what you don't realize, whether you like it or not, is that you are only able to do what you are capable of right now. If you want to do more, you simply have to upskill, or basically work on being more competent overall. Only then will you naturally be able to start doing more. \n\nWhen I say more competent, I don't mean just your technical skills. Other things are also important. For example, getting the right amount of rest, having a proper diet, staying fit, knowing people skills like how to talk to all various kinds of people we meet, when to stay silent in group conversations and so on. \n\nLet this post become a moment for you to reflect and asking yourself on \"what steps are you taking to make yourself more capable for the challenges in your life?\"",

I lull myself into this basically dissociative high and just fucking love it.

I’ve never done drugs, but I’m afraid of becoming an addict. I desperately crave that “zoned-out” feeling that I’ve lulled myself into for around 10 years now.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice from where to go from here? I want to get better, but at the same time, I’ve always hated being present in the moment, it just doesn’t feel right. I guess I need advice on how to feel like I belong in the moment?
