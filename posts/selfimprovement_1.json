And furthermore the financial aspect as well. \n\nWhen I really think about it I find that they are not so enjoyable as any other kind of soft drink. And in the absence of them I don't seek caffeine from other sources such as coffee. In fact drinking coffee instead has not satisfied the itch.\n\nThe itch starts once I am engaged in the morning. For instance when I arrive at work. And allowing mtlyself to go and buy a drink gives me a great sense of relief from an unseen burden.\n\nWhat I really want I suppose is some ideas on how to break this cycle.",

They are interested in themselves** \\- twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. A show of interest in other, like every other tips here, must be done sincerely. It must pay off not only for the person showing interest but also for the person receiving the attention. \n\n# Smile \n\nThe expression one wears on their face is far more important than the clothes one wears. Action speaks louder than words and a smile says “I like you and you make me happy.” **Your smile is a messenger of good will that brightens the day of any individual who sees it.** \n\nWhat if you don’t feel like smiling? Force yourself to. Act as if you are happy and you will tend to be happy.  \n\n# Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language \n\n**We should realise that someones name is completely owned by there person who you are dealing with. Their name sets them apart, makes them unique.** \n\nRemember that name and you have paid a subtle but very effective compliment. But forget it or mispronounce it then you have placed yourself at a disadvantage. \n\n# Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves\n\n“Exclusive attention to the person who is speaking to you is very important. Nothing else is so flattering as that.” - Charles W. Eliot, former Harvard president. \n\n**The most violent critic can be subdue in the presence of a patient and sympathetic listener.** A listener who is silent and will let the critic get everything off of his chest. That is what we all want when we are in trouble, a sympathetic listen who we can unburden ourselves. \n\n**To be a good conversationalist, be interesting. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that the other person will enjoy answering and encourage them to talk about themselves.** \n\n# Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely \n\nThis law, if obey, will bring you countless friends and happiness. But the very moment you break it, you shall get into endless trouble. The law is : **Always make the other person feel important.** \n\n**Give unto others what we would have other give unto us.** The age old saying “treat others how you want to be treated” is the key to making someone feel important.

My sleep scheduale has been basically backwards for almost a year, I have no hobbies outside of smoking and going out for drinks. I know I’m meant to achieve something and become successful I just have no clue what really interest me anymore. I don’t like the same things that I used to like, I don’t have the motivation to workout anymore, I live at my parents house still and basically stay in my room doing nothing until the weekend comes and I’m able to go out and get banged up with the boys. \n\nAt this point, most of my friends have started a career or atleast something that interest and is working for them. I just don’t know where to start. Something may peak my interest for a minute but I’ll eventually forget about the idea and go back to my day of accomplishing nothing.\n\nI know I’m headed down the wrong path, but I also know that’s not where I want to be going.\n\nHow do you guys find motivation and drive? How can I suck up that I’m not making $100,000 + a year and just work a regular job? Everyone says any job is better than no job but what is life working 40+ hours a week and not even making enough money to live the lifestyle you want? \n\nDon’t really know where I’m trying to go with this post but I do want to change my life and get back to the ambitious dreamer I once was. I guess any tips to getting on the right path at 25 for someone who really isn’t even sure what that “right path” is?",

I went through the scariest past few days of my life, and finally was able to see a change in our family relationships. Between poverty and our own issues, there has long been hatred and trauma in our family, but I’m blessed that my great-grandparents, grandparents, and mom are all still alive in order to see it happen. My whole life I was afraid of my mom and developed hatred for her. She felt the same way towards her mom. Her mom felt the same way towards her own mother. Two days before I turned 18, I ended up running away and cutting my mom off. The police got involved, and I turned myself in. The last few days have been nothing but constant fights and arguments, and finally, this was the breaking point. My family on her side, who have been avoiding each other and refusing to ever address our issues finally starting communicating and working to resolve the issues we’ve all had for so long. My own mom finally broke down her walls and for the first time in my life we had an honest conversation and she apologized to me. Now, we’re working towards rebuilding our relationship. Instead of me cutting her off and moving away, which would have only restarted the cycle for myself. I’m proud of myself for finally standing up for myself when I was TERRIFIED to do so. But I’m proud of the outcome of that as well- seeing my family finally start to work together to resolve our issues before the next generation entered the cycle.",

People take, perceive, and interpret things differently. Some see it as a source of motivation, others see it as an insensitive impractical statement to reality, but neither side is invalid.\n2. People add different meanings to their unique needs. \n3. People have choices to respond to their problems. Staying in it, accepting it, managing it, or getting out of it.  \n4. Not everyone will agree with you\n5. People see reality differently. \n6. Some people base their sense of reality on the external, some base it internally. \n7. Life is about experience after all. We all eventually die, our whole perception of reality goes away, why not live a life that's meaningful to you when you can? \n\nFeel free to discuss anything",

We are always tempted to think negatively.\n\nFrom my own personal experience, I could tell that: \"Negative thinking is so addictive...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhenever, as I feel dislike someone, a temptation always comes and urges me to imagine bad things, bad words, bad actions, bad attitudes, ....\n\n# We can't completely avoid negative thinking\n\nDuring a day, the mind always jumps between thoughts. \n\nThere are lots of thoughts wandering around, and our job is to be **mindful** so that we can fight a battle with them\n\nWe are always thinking. It hardly exists the moment that I have a void mind, except in the morning and before sleep when I practice meditation\n\nTogether with positive thinking, negative thinking dominates our thoughts. And there's something to realize: it's easier to think negatively, because it's more attractive...\n\nTherefore, unless we don't have any thought, we will frequently meet with negative thinking\n\n# How to fight against it?\n\nAs I've been writing a lot day by day, I realized that: writing can really help us to **externalize** our thoughts and our emotions\n\n* If you read literature, you might feel the feelings of the author from his or her words\n* If you look at a picture drawn by a great artist, you might see a hidden voice he or she gives \n\nIt's so miraculous, isn't it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... you get the idea, right?\n\nWhenever you are tempted to think negatively, write down exactly what you think\n\nYou can prepare yourself a notebook with a pen, and put them into your pocket. Or, you can prepare a digital note-taking software and write down your thoughts **whenever you realize** that you are thinking negatively\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's very difficult at first... However, if you practice it, believe me, you will be able to control your emotion better\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The difficulties you might have\n\n**Firstly, you don't believe that this method works**\n\nWe are very smart, therefore, we will only do things that profit us, that we think are beneficial.\n\nConsequently, procrastinating is the first challenge...\n\nYou might ask: \"Hey, will it work? Are you sure that it's gonna work? What if it doesn't work?\"\n\nIn that case, your answer should be: \"But wait, if I do it, I have a chance. But if I don't do it, nothing changes, nothing happens. So give it a try is a better option...\"\n\nJust do it, and, isolate the perfectionism...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Secondly, you resist the practice**\n\nThis is a habit... And as it's a habit, it takes time to be created\n\nSo, when you are thinking negatively, you might not realize that you are thinking negatively\n\nOr even when you do know that you are thinking negatively, you just can't stop thinking to open the note to write things down\n\nThis is a real challenge... as this method works very well, we must pay a price to \"purchase\" it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's it! A method I learned and tested. It really works!\n\n**Remember**: write exactly the stuff in your head down. And as you write, you will notice that your negative emotion is drained out slowly and slowly",

        "text": "# 1. Goldilocks Rule\n\nHaving goals that are too challenging demotivates you over the long run. You work your ass off but no progress seems to be bad. It is destructive to your ambitions. At the same time, if your goal is too easy, there is no force motivating you to do it. You will get bored easily.\n\nThe ideal goal is not too easy that you get bored doing it but also not too challenging that it disincentives you to keep going.\n\n# 2. Focus On 3-4 Goals At A Time\n\nYour attention and time are limited resources. Focusing on too many goals at one time forces you to spread your time and attention too thin. You may make progress on all of them but only very little. Over the long run, it won’t seem like you have achieved much.\n\nSo, only focus on 3 - 4 goals at one time. Once you achieve one, replace it with another one.\n\n# 3. Break Goals Down Into Smaller Goals \n\nIf you follow the Goldilocks Rule, your goals may seem a bit challenging, but that’s good. Here’s how we can make it simpler for you to achieve. Break it down into. Break it down into monthly goals, then weekly goals, and finally daily goals. \n\nThe plan here is to be able to identify what needs to be done and when it needs to be done for you to achieve your goal. ",

        "text": "I (25M) have a long time friend (also 25M), I've known him since we were 8 years old. I love the guy. We grew up very similar and very close but since we graduated from school we have gone in different directions. He is definitely more successful than me from an outside view, however I can't come to terms with the way he lives his life outside of work. He does drugs almost daily, plays Runescape, goes on TikTok/Netflix for half the day when he doesn't have work.\n\nI would love to spend more time with him because I love his personality but I just can't be around him for extended periods due to the clash in habits.\n\nMy main issue is with the constant media consumption and drugs... idc if he doesn't want to \"self-improve\", but just knowing how much that stuff zaps your motivation to do other things, it hurts me to see him indulging in them so often (coming from someone who used to do a lot of drugs and play video games all day). He actually speaks about \"not feeling motivated enough to do things\". But I feel like I'll sound like an ass if I basically say \"TikTok, weed, and Apex Legend fuck brain up\".\n\nSo far the only solution I've found is to spend less time with him. We lived together for a little while and I tried to lead by example, but that didn't do anything (I since have moved out). I still haven't figured out how to tell people about self improvement without sounding like a crazy person so I usually refrain from doing so. I'll totally accept it and move forward if he doesn't want to listen, and I understand that you should accept people as they are, but I can't help but want the best for him. I'm sad to watch us continually grow apart :(.\n\nHow do I speak to him about this?",

I cannot handle studying what feels like my entire life just to pull out a B in a class that I will literally never use in my field. I feel like all my work is completely futile. I am finding that I am just not good at engineering. I am a problem solver, but I am kinda average at math and science. However, it does not help that my GPA right now is at a 1.80 because I had to drop out last semester because I was diagnosed with depression and my grades were tanking, so I basically failed everything. Now presently, I am just trying to pull out a 2 point and possibly change my major to something else. I am thinking about forestry because I love the outdoors and it also seems easier.\n\nI guess my problem with that is I hate quitting, but this major is eating me alive, and I feel so out of place. I rarely think about what I want to do after college because it honestly stresses me out because I have yet to take a civil engineering class that actually interested me. \n\nMy main question I guess would be what do I do? I haven't talked about this to anyone yet, more because I just recently thought about switching majors to something that is not engineering. I honestly do not care if I make less money doing something I love. \n\nI want to enjoy college, and I enjoy every part of it except for the classes I have taken. But at this point I just want to get my degree and dip.\n\nAnyway, sorry this is a complete mess, my mind is completely shattered right now, I am having trouble thinking straight. I want to get better so badly, I just need someone else's perspective to help me think straight. Any help is appreciated. \n\nTL;DR: Majoring in civil engineering but I hate it. Considering changing majors but I need to somehow get through this semester. Mental health is in the gutter now.",

I got a dead end job out of college hoping to land an actual career in a year and that isnt working. my degree( B.S. in game art) hasnt gotten me a job, and admitted im not the most skilled at 3d modeling or animation.    \nAs a back up I got my certification in medical coding, its what my mom does and my parents were pushing it on me seeing as how much its done for my mom. I got certified in december, but no one is heiring without professional experience. I was supposed to get a position at my moms job, but her boss backed out on me the day before our interview.  \nSo to get experience Im taking this thing thats supposed to equal one year worth of experience. Now im about half way done and all it has done is re-enforced the fact that i HATE doing this and i dont want that for my life. but my parents are pushing me to do it and since i live under thier roof i dont have many other options.   \nWhat i want to do, as bad as it sounds, is be a full time artist. I want to open a store and sell my sticker and paintings and go to anime conventions and comic cons and booth those. Im trying to have more of an impact on instgram but i cant seem to get a following, im at under 150.  \n\n\nI was a start student. from a young age i was top of my class. I got great grades and was a teachers pet and evryone told me how i was going to be successful in life......and now i work a dead end job and cant seem to get out of it.   \n\n\nI have a boyfriend, weve been together almost 3 years and are talking about moving in together. he lives an hour away from me and we've deceided to move closer to where he is, but its suburban. I want to have a remote job so i can afford to live with him, and i refuse to live with him unless i know i wont be a burden. i also dont have a car and cant afford one.  \n\n\nIm trying to learn python so i can get into the tech field.  \n\n\nI just feel like i cant do anything. i feel like a failure and a burden. Im over worked between my full time job, studying for the medical coding, trying to make my art business and learning python on top of my housework and normal life chores.  \nMy parents charge me 1k in rent with is basically  half of my monthly take home pay. im trying to put 500 away from house savings.   \ni dont know what to do. when i was younger i had it all figured out and i feel like im falling apart.  \nim having breakdowns thought the day, i feel like my depression is coming back,  im stressed and tired and i feel like im at my breaking point.  \n\n\ni know i should be happy, i at least have a job, and a place to live, a good partner. when i think about it all i just think about how im letting him down, i cant help with the moving cost or anything really. and im not entirely happy with living with my parents as me and my father often get into arguments and i dont get viewed as the 23 year old adult that i am. like, i cant even make friends. my dad gets worried everyone in the world has bad intentions.  \n\n\nim stuck. and im trying. but ive just failed so much i want to quit.",

Tell myself that it's okay that I'm unemployed and even if I find a job my autism will almost assuredly keep me underemployed? That my lack of friends or any relationship experience at my age is acceptable? I just don't get it, how is any if it supposed to make sense? How am I supposed to be okay with all my shortcomings? How am I supposed to be okay with failing when too much failure leads to abandonment and ostracization? None of it makes any sense to me and just makes me feel even worse because I can't get it.\n\nI guess my main question would be how do I even start to wrap my head around actually being able to see myself as anything other than worthless?

If you're an asshole, not masturbating isn't gonna make you less of an asshole.  \n\nPeople are making those superficial things the backbone of their worth and it just irks me.

Geeks are not a problem, I've realized how cool I am for the most part is about how many challenges I've overcome and how good I am at doing things. My social value = my ability to overcome hard things\n\nThroughout childhood I was always a background character. I spent my days sitting at home watching porn and tv. On the social hierarchy, I've always been on the bottom.\n\nI never snuck out to parties, never had a gf, never had a kiss, never took risks. I never tried to do things. I never lived that fulfilling take risks and fun teenagerhood that I could look back on. My adolescence was either lame stuff or nothing. I didn't live the \"coming of age\" story and now at 20, I'm having an \"early life crisis.\"\n\nMy life could've been so much more fulfilling and fun if I had tried it to be. I need challenges to overcome, I can't fight, can't cook, I'm bad at school, my diet is bad, I don't workout. I'm not good at a lot of things and that makes me very timid and reserved. Even with my friends, I'm surrounded by losers.\n\nI want to feel like a winner, like everyone wants to be like me. I've craved position of leadership and respect for years and now. I want to have many friends, to be looked up upon by people. I want to feel like a winner by overcoming things!\n\nWhat are things I should challenge myself to? I'm starting to workout, learn to diet better and get into martial arts. Of all things my #1 priority is becoming more socially literate because last year I got a taste into being cool as I was talking to many people at college, except being a loser my whole life I did a lot of cringe things in that year which has put my social anxiety on overdrive",

        "text": "How I built My Social Confidence:                   \n\nStep 1: Around the summer of 2018 i finally decided to address my lack of social skills. I bought a new notebook 📒 and a pen 🖊️.                                                                 \n\nStep 2: I went to public social events and places where lots of people gather like malls and central parts of cities.\n\nStep 3: I started approaching various groups of people that looked interesting to me and gave them the opportunity to write something about themselves on my notebook. I told them that I was collecting messages from people that look interesting.\n\nStep 4: Not everyone was into it but some people played along with me, and as they were thinking of what to write I would try to initiate conversation with other members of the group.\n\nStep 5: I didn’t stay for too long in any one group as to not disturb them with my random presence, but some of them actually liked my company and invited me to things. I would try to read social cues and leave if I felt unwanted or stay longer if I felt welcome.\n\nStep 6: After doing this for 6-7 months almost every weekend, I became increasingly more confident in my ability to initiate conversation with strangers and create value and fun. This gave me the opportunity to become bolder and more open. I learned when it is a good time to ask for contact information and when I should probably abort mission.\n\nConclusion: I filled 5 full notebooks in the course of a year and had countless conversations with strangers. Some of which are still my friends to this day.          \n\nLet’s have a discussion about this Matter.\n\nDo you have any questions regarding my story? \n\nWhat are the biggest challenges or concerns you have around self-development and social contact?\n\nI am dying to know what other people think about this or how they managed to overcome similar obstacles around it.\n\nYou can also follow me on @batwez7 on Twitter for Daily Content around self-development.",

I myself had to act like his Uber for the longest time and I only stopped when he went on a rant saying how all \"girls are ungrateful\" and how I have \"no skills\" and need to \"go to Pakistan to get fixed\" because I am apparently too liberal because I want to work and not stay at home to just cook and clean.  I don't want to be bitter. I want to ignore his success and just focus on me. How can I let go of my jealousy and bitterness from having a brother who seems to get everything handed to him?",

Though my partner may have it worse with family than I do. I still understand the pain and suffering to an point. \n\nMy partner's depression is becoming uncontrollable (I also have depression and others I'd prefer not to speak of). Everyday there is a problem with someone or something and everyday there is a problem with me and what I'm doing. Yet I'm constantly told I'm amazing and go over and beyond. We both live with my parents. It is not an ideal situation, its the opposite of what we want but at our current salaries we cannot live on our own in an $1100 single bed apartment.\n\nI know that our environment is a major part of our problem. We desperately want to move out but we're right on poverty line. We barely make enough for living but we make too much for any financial help. We have been actively looking for jobs but around us no place is hiring for a wage more than what we make for our level of achievements. \n\nLately I have been trying to make my partner more comfortable and less stressed. I have given massages to relax, I've tried to distract from our dooming reality, and I have kept my mouth shut on things that used to turn into fights. Honestly, I don't have the energy for it. I don't bring up things that upset me or bother me because it will either turn around onto me or I end up feeling bad for bringing it up because then its all self loathing talk. \n\nIt has become that I am exhausted from my partner being exhausted. We both are struggling financially and because of that, we struggle mentally and emotionally too. We went from being out all the time to being sad homebodies. It is so difficult. I see now why people were committing during the pandemic (I'm not saying it's a good justification but this level of desperation gets to you). Also we met during the pandemic so it didn't start until we had severe financial trouble after being homeless.\n\nWe just want our own space, and money we can eat with and money we can live with.\n\nI honestly feel to my limit. We have discussed separation to better ourselves and get back together but one (if not both) of us would end up homeless. Also, I do not want to lose my best friend. I do not want to lose the partner of my dreams. I feel lost. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want us to be happy. I want to be in our own space. I want my partner to feel like they're not in this alone. We want to feel the freedom we used to have. We want to do the things we used to be able to do. \n\nIt's come to the point where my partner refused to hear me out on mental disorders and coping mechanisms. How can I better be there for my partner during this extremely difficult time?",

Everybody who's worked with my dad says he is a super efficient employee. Any tips to increase my work effort and motivation? I also have ADHD but combatted it with medication which has helped. Every time the thought of going back to an hourly job pops up it makes me uncomfortable as those type jobs have been some of the most depressing times of my life, but even though I have the solution right in front of me with this job, but again, I don't feel I put in the effort I should.

I live a life that’s way better than many others, but also I don’t feel like I’m so interested in anything anymore. \n\nSubjects at school feel stupid and constricting (not all of them, certain ones), my personal interests feel pushed aside. Whenever I try to do what I “want”, I quickly lose my positive attitude.\n\nMost importantly, my feelings and emotions have been overlooked for long periods of time, dulled with social networks and tiredness. \n\nI would like to regain the childlike attitude towards life.

        "text": "For twenty three days I have been cutting down on my smoking, cutting it in half from a whole packet to half a packet, I have failed five of those days but this is the longest I have made an effort to reduce my smoking...\n\nNormally I would try to quit cold turkey and would be smoking again within a few days max. That is the trouble I have had before is that I felt like I should change or stop certain habits straight away. Then my mind would manipulate me into thinking I don't care or want to change which would take me back to square one.\n\nI have always known deep down that small changes are the changes that can be maintained and built upon but I always ignored that fact because I wanted instant results but the time spent looking for a quick fix (hypnosis, thinking techniques, some secret to the universe) ultimately took away more time with nothing to show for it. I always dismissed the idea of making small changes because I had so many things I wanted to change that I didn't feel like I had months to fix just one thing about myself.\n\nAnyway recently I decided to give making small changes a try. The cutting down of smoking has been the hardest but hasn't been that difficult.. I have screwed up some days but I don't look at it as a total failure as it is a long term effort to change. On top of breaking down the habit of smoking I have been creating small healthier habits. A small workout everyday, doing stretches when I get out of bed, brushing my teeth, helping out more around the house workday or not.. things that seem insignificant and small and that shouldn't have taken until the age of twenty six to start doing properly but it is marginal changes that make the difference in the long run.",

        "text": "A few months back I graduated High School, and was riding the high of life, and this newfound sense of freedom, and a hope that whatever the rest of life would bring would be awesome. And though I have found myself overjoyed with many aspects of my life currently, I still find that I'm often lost in a daze, utterly uncertain about my life, and my future.\n\n I didn't enroll in another semester of my local community college. Looking back on it, this might not have been a wise choice, but I personally didn't feel like it was getting me anywhere. The major I chose wasn't available due to my math grades, and to add to that, I would have to take 3 math classes to get up to that level. I could have avoided this by studying longer prior to the math exam required for entry, but I didn't. And while 3 math classes isn't too bad, it made me think about whether I really wanted to dedicate my next years to Environmental Science and school, just after getting out of HS. \n\nI'm not currently employed, as most jobs in my area are food service and make me mad, having most of their appeal being made up in the prospect of good tips on weekends, meaning I have to sacrifice those few days to make maybe 14-17 an hr, with every other day being paid 10. The jobs that are much more enjoyable with good pay are mostly seasonal, which simply isn't consistent or sustainable. \n\nNo matter what I do, it feels as though I'm behind everyone else. They're all in good colleges, likely setting up their futures, and I'm just here, stuck. Beggars can't be choosers I suppose. \n\nSo, In short, I'm a loser, and haven't a clue what to do about it. My existence atm is characterized by silent jealousy and deep uncertainty. I taught myself how to play guitar, bake, and cook. I bike and workout regularly, and even these things I do to maintain good habits and health only distract me from my uncertainties for a short while. Maybe I'm being too stubborn and picky, I wouldn't put it above myself. I just, don't want to tie myself down to something so soon. \n\nI guess I just want meaning in my life, to do something important or cool. Feel free to critique as you please.",

There are two major things which I am mostly concerned about. \n\nOne thing is academics. I am a 4 year med student (eu program) and my academics my seem successful on paper but I don’t feel successful at all.  I fail or don’t show up on most of my exams on the first try then I pass it in summer on 2nd or 3rd attempt. I know I can probably do better but I am just bad about handling stress so I delay it till summer. It’s hard for me to navigate school, social life and taking care for myself at the same. Usually when I start studying I get negative thoughts which affect my mood (I become nervous, frustrated, anxious) then I just simply stop studying. Next day I am even more frustrated because I haven’t done what I had to do. Then I think I am not gonna make it till deadline so I just give up. I fail the test. New subject begins and the pattern continues.\n\nThe second thing is love life. I am not in a relationship nor I am looking for one but I really like to go out and talking with guys. I feel bored when I don’t have multiple men’s attention. I know I should probably focus on myself more then on meaninglessness relationship but sometimes I feel like I am dependent on external validation.",

At my peak a few years back, I can do more than 30 pull ups in a row, run a 2.4km run in 8 minutes and achieve about a 100 dips consecutively without getting off the dip bar. \n\nHowever, compared to  people who have been training for less than half the time that I've spent training, they're able to do so much more skills, and at a higher level. They're able to do planche, one arm handstands, one arm pull ups, and many more insane feats.\n\nFor a few years, I've been thinking constantly on why these people are able to achieve such high feats in such a short time, while I'm no where close even though I've been active all my life. Regrettably, I only found my answer recently, and I'll be tracking my progress to see whether it's true. \n\nThe reason is so simple and obvious, which is me getting too comfortable. As mentioned, I've been active all my life, and that the idea of being \"active\", was comfortable for me. If I don't exercise, I would feel uncomfortable, but when I do exercise, I didn't have that drive and resolve to push myself to reach newer heights. \n\nI used to have that drive, and that's how I achieved those personal fitness goals of mine. But after a while, I got too comfortable, and simply exercised for the sake of exercising. Somehow, that didn't cross my mind, and I've been constantly beating myself up for not achieving new fitness achievements and being weak. \n\nWith that, I just want to put it out there that you guys ain't \"weak\", but simply too comfortable with where you are right now. If you've not been progressing, maybe it's time to sit down and ask yourself truthfully, are you really pushing yourself to reach new heights, or are you just doing it for the sake of being \"consistent\".",

That's over an entire day wasted each week. And knowing I've been doing this for about 10 years, that means I've likely spent over 18,000 hours on YouTube in my life. Or to put in in slightly more terrifying terms... ***over 2 years***. And that's not even including my time spent on everything else (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook etc.)...\n\nI've always had a terrible attention span thanks to this, and with the shortening of content in recent years (thanks largely to TikTok), I'm really starting to feel the effects of an ever-diminishing attention span. I can't even watch TV without simultaneously eating a snack and browsing on my phone, let alone work without listening to music or podcasts whilst also daydreaming and then proceeding to take a break every 10 minutes just to reach for my phone again.\n\nI've tried to limit myself to watching actual educational and useful videos on YouTube, instead of just the mind-numbing TikTok compilations &amp; prank videos &amp; nonsense. But I've noticed even the educational videos recently are all punctured with random gifs and memes and sound effects every 5 seconds, excessive jump cuts, and a voice over talking in twice the speed in an obnoxiously loud and attention-grabbing voice. I was watching one earlier today, and just started wondering what the heck I'm even doing with my life. It feels like every bit of content recently is designed to rot my brain, and I know there's still plenty of good content out there - but for some annoying reason, I always find myself coming back to the stupid brain-rotting stuff.\n\nI dropped out of university after just a few months (not because of a short attention span lol, but because of social anxiety and mental health issues, but that's another story), but it's been about 5 years now since I dropped out and I've been unemployed and living with my parents ever since (who are very supportive and I'm SUPER thankful for). But my social anxiety means it's damn difficult for me to get a regular job, so for the past few years I've been working on trying to pursue my dreams of becoming a full-time artist. Except, I haven't really been working hard on it at all... because I spend most my time on social media and mindlessly browsing the internet. And I just know, if I weren't so addicted to social media, I would have a full-time income by now and could be achieving so much. And I have ***so*** much I want to do with my life, but I feel like I'm just wasting away.\n\nAnd I've not even touched upon the effects that social media has on my self-esteem &amp; mental health. The fact that I can spend HOURS living vicariously through these 'picture-perfect' lives presented to me on Instagram and YouTube, and then feeling sh\\*t about myself afterwards. But I think everyone is already aware of this problem and this post is now extremely long so I should probably just go.\n\nIf you've read this far, congratulations. You're attention span is already 10x stronger than most in this generation, and 50x stronger than mine.\n\nI've decided to quit social media and reduce internet/tech for 1 month (with the exception for workout videos as I can't afford a gym membership, and unfortunately I also need to use social media a bit for work which is unavoidable. But they are the only exceptions). It's Just for 1 month. It might not be long, but I just want to know what I can achieve if I actually get my head down and take away the negative distractions. I don't know where I'll be this time in a month, but hopefully a bit happier, at least.\n\nAs soon as I hit the '**post**' button it is done, and I am disconnecting from social media. And regardless of whether anybody actually reads this or not, I'll be coming back with an update in a month...",

I believed I was a musician at heart and fortunately had the opportunity to be a semi-professional musician for 4 or 5 years which worked along with doing some odd jobs. I had dreams of being a full time musician or maybe having a successful self employed business as I'm a smart enough guy. Long story short, the music dream ended badly but I ended up with a good chunk of money out of it. I got married to a great girl and made an international move to be closer to her family. I ended up not being able to work for a few years because of visa issues but we lived frugally off the money I had saved and I got the chance to try to start a few self employed online businesses. Over the next few years the businesses didn't really work out. Music didn't work out. We ended up having kids and staying close to wife's family for nearly 10 years. I got anxiety and had panic attacks. Was extremely homesick. Finally managed to move us all home again and began to feel better. I retrained and got myself a decent enough job just above the national average salary. Now though....I just feel like nothing in my life ever worked out the way I wanted it to. I regret wasting all that time thinking I could make music work or be self employed. I regret not using that money I made from music to help buy a house instead of wasting it by living in a place where I couldn't work. I regret that now I'm nearly 40 and I've just started at the bottom of the career ladder. I regret the fact that I don't own a house and now houses are so much more expensive I will have to buy a crap starter home for my family and won't ever be able to give my wife a nice house or my kids the sort of houses that I grew up in. I'll be in my 70's by the time I ever get to pay a mortgage off. Now I'm just so negative I don't think anything will ever work out. I see all these people online with side hustles making money and I don't even have the positivism to try because I know it won't work out. I've stopped playing music which was my life long hobby - there doesn't seem any point to play anymore. I just don't feel happy anymore. I'm very negative and honestly feel like I regret my entire life's choices. Every time I see a nice car or drive by a nice house I am hit in the face with how I will never achieve any of these things. I have no drive to try and improve in my career because what's the point? If I work hard to try to get a better paying job or get a promotion for more money, whats the point? House prices will continue to rise and any pay increase won't have made a difference in my ability to buy something nice. I just feel like so 'blah' and dead on the inside. How do I shake all this negative crap and be happy again?",

And we are going to forget everything we have seen and heard by the next day. Only to repeat the exact same thing.  \n\n\nReally, what are we gaining from this? Just being curious about other people's lives that don't even know we exist? Being anxious about their troubles that are their own faults? Entertainment and comfort that mentally and physically exhausts us and just makes us wonder why we didn't put our time on something else?  \n\n\nWhy do we even use social media?  \n\n\nRemember, my brothers and my sisters, that we won't be out here for long. Our time is limited and before we even realize anything, it has gone and we've grown older.   \n\n\nWe have 24 hours a day, most of which we have to put in our obligations from school to work.   \n\n\nThe few hours a day that we actually get for ourselves, we should put into things that our older self will thank us for. That makes us feel good about ourselves. That strengthen us and improve us for the better.   \n\n\nAnd not things that make us regret putting our time into them.",
