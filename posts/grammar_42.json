        "text": "I’m reading Priscilla Long’s The Writer’s Portable Mentor. In the chapter breaking down the complex sentence (which she describes as a sentence that has an independent clause and at least one dependent clause), she includes the following sentence in the section in which she deals with sentences with WHAT and WHY clauses:\n\nWhat frightens me is the otherness of vultures.\n\nShe marks “What frightens me” as the dependent clause. What remains is “is the otherness of vultures.”\n\nI’m confused by this example. How is “is the otherness of vultures” an independent clause? A clause must have a subject and a predicate. In what sense does the supposed independent clause “is the otherness of vultures” have a subject and predicate?\n\nCan anyone help?\n\n[Edit] To clarify, the questions in that last paragraph are rhetorical. I understand that “is the otherness of vultures” is not an independent clause. I understand that it doesn’t have a subject and predicate. What’s throwing me is that I see that this is a complete sentence with a dependent clause, but it’s not clearly divided into dependent and independent clauses like the other example sentences.\n\nFor instance, “They are the only ones who understand me.” The independent clause—“They are the only ones”—stands out distinctly from the dependent clause—“who understand me”—that follows.\n\nIn the sentence that’s throwing me, the divisions aren’t so clear. I’m having a hard time figuring out what the complete independent clause is. It’s making me feel a bit dumb at the moment, but my defense, I guess, is that I haven’t thought about such things since elementary school.",

After a vigorous debate, I have to conclude that my bolded statement qualifies as a double negative.  Detailed evidence provided by /u/ajblue98 demonstrates authoritatively that the \"-less\" suffix creates the second negative within the statement.  Furthermore, I agree with his/her stylistic assessment that weaving in either \"The threat has teeth\" or \"The threat is credible\" would have achieved a more affirmative stance and avoided the initial confusion that led to this post.",
