        "text": "So, you've probably heard about the findings of [this study](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/7fc2bf_ee1737c3c9d4468881bf1434814a6f8f.pdf) supposedly showing iron-clad proof that building only market-rate units brings down rents for everyone. It's been touted by market urbanists as vindication for their more laissez faire approach to the housing crisis.\n\nThe reason I'm making this post is because I wanna collectively think through some of the implications of this finding so we can all possibly come to a more wholistic way of looking at the housing crisis instead of just going with the prevailing mode of thinking on the issue.\n\n1. If the finding is to be believed, should cities be looking to keep rent spikes in line with inflation? \n\n2. If so, then do municipalities have to create more housing during times when inflation is high? (like it is now?)\n\n3. If the finding is to be believed, would you agree that there are practical limitations for cities trying to decrease their rent spikes by 10%, 20%, or 30%?\n\n4. If so, would you agree that there is little incentive for large developers to build enough housing to drop rents even 10%?\n\n5. If so, would you agree that non-market housing has a role to play in the fight for housing affordability?",

My product goal is to construct a 3D digital city plan with multiple economic access points and an emphasis on infrastructures as well as community-oriented design. My city plan will attempt to deal with many of the issues observed in cities nowadays through the creation of more opportunities for affordable housing, better organized roads to avoid congestion, walkable areas and the creation of communal space to improve social well-being. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far I have been working on figuring out the technical part of the design (ie use of 3D rendering software) but I've hit somewhat of a roadblock in doing research for the planning as I am a bit lost and don't know where to start or what basics to understand. So I came to this subreddit for some pointers on where to start or what kinds of trends to examine and incorporate into my design.

Or override the restrictive laws of the municipality, if it’s not already legal to build what the state/fed wants.\n\nI just watched a City Beautiful video and he said that state-guided regulations are more common in Europe and that California is trying to do the same, which is somewhat similar to what I’m describing.

Cruise is not far behind them. however, planners seem to be asleep at the wheel (pardon the car-pun) when it comes to trying to shape the future of this technology. it seems that most planners fall into one of two camps:\n\n1. self driving cars development is so unpredictable or far into the future that it's not worth trying to plan for them\n2. they're evil and should be banned because cars are bad.\n\nhowever, I worry that there is another automobile vs streetcars situation shaping up in the near future. a taxi without a driver could really reduce the cost per fare, and ruggedized fleet EVs have the potential to get many more miles than a typical uber/taxi vehicle. this could make taxiing competitive with driving a personally owned car in terms of price. if that happens, it could be detrimental to transit ridership and create both corporate lobbying for more road space as well as individuals wanting more of it.\n\nat the same time, planners have the potential to use the technology to achieve their goals instead of fighting it. \n\nsome examples:\n\n1. as more people use taxis, there will be less need for parking, so if planners can do a swap of car lanes to bike lanes before induced demand fills it back in, then we can improve a city without having to fight against the car-brains for every little scrap of road surface.\n2. a carrot/stick approach can push companies to strive toward higher occupancy SDCs. so implementing congestion charges for single-occupant taxis while subsidizing taxis whenever they have 3+ passengers inside would create an economic incentive to implement a more uber-pool type taxi service, reducing the number of vehicles per passenger that is moved. that would also present another opportunity to remove more parking or driving lanes. \n   1. a typical US bus system spends about $2 per passenger-mile (WMATA metrobus cost $1.99 per passenger-mile pre-covid). today, an Uber costs roughly $2-$2.50 per vehicle mile (even when they rent a car, thus no externalized costs). so economically, a \\~$1 to $1.50 uber would provide more effective transportation per dollar than a bus. the drawback, of course, is congested streets. however, if SDC makers mostly operated with 3 passengers onboard, the traffic problem would be ameliorated, AND the cost to a city would be greatly reduced. so, it may no longer make any sense to operate buses in a location where pooled SDCs exist. anywhere with more ridership than cannot be reasonably handled by 3 PPV taxis would make sense to build grade-separated rail (elevated light metros are my favorite). \n   2. such a subsidy could also be restricted to trips to/from light rail/metro stops. the convenience of being able to take a taxi to a metro stop would entice a lot of people who currently have to take a bus that may be a 15min, 30min or longer headway.\n   3. if BEVs are used as SDC pooled taxi, the carbon footprint per passenger-mile would not only be below a typical bus, but below the average European metro. \n   4. generally promoting an environment where fewer people feel the need to own a car, due to low cost SDC taxis, would encourage more people to take public transit, walk, or bike, which are all things that good urban planning should strive for. \n\nI think the time for \"it's never going to happen\" or \"we'll deal with it when it gets here\" is over. we don't want a repeat of the streetcar situation where automobiles got in their way, damaged their tracks, and took ridership such that they were not longer viable. we want to figure out how to curb the problems with SDC while also using their advantages to produce better urban environments.",

Most traffic lights where I live (Vancouver Canada) are 'smart' in that they detect whoever has been waiting the longest and very rarely have 'fixed' cycles. So for example, if a car has been waiting to turn left longest, there's a left turn signal. But if the car waiting to go straight on the cross street has been there longest, then it goes first etc.\n\nI then thought, wouldn't it be easy to implement transit signal priority? All you'd have to do is treat transit vehicles as the 'longest waiting car'. Whenever a transit vehicle arrives, conflicting transit gets a yellow light and transit goes first.\n\nBut then on reading about transit priority my head is swimminb from all the complicated 'treatments'. Re ordering the signal phases, green extension, red truncation etc. so complicated. Can't you just put a special detector in the street and make the next phase for the transit vehicle before going back to the next vehicle that's been there longest?",

Is there any way to use this to actualize my goal?\n\n4) Curriculum-wise, what aspects of urban planning, should I be considering when researching on postgraduate degrees? Budgeting? Policymaking? Public administration? Again, I am into data science and I want to focus primarily on transportation system\n\n5) As for work experiences, where should I begin and what should I learn about?\n\nI'd appreciate it if you can illuminate me on these.

This makes sense in more rural areas (esp. ones with septic), and I definitely know that people with a few acres of space seem to really take advantage of it to create enriched areas for their children.\n\nHowever, most people don't have a few acers of space, and eight thousand sq ft with a house in the middle of it doesn't seem like enough space for much in the way of activities (unless your kids want to be constantly chasing frisbees over the fence, and your neighbors are very patient). \n\nOn the other hand, the benefits of raising children in walkable areas seem to never be discussed. For example, are chores way easier because kids like strollers and hate cars (my impression as a non-parent)? Do pre-license adolescents have more independence? Does having a park in walking distance make it easier to fight screen addiction, because \"go play outside\" is something kids can actually do? Do kids stay healthier when there's fewer stroads around and its safer to wander a bit? \n\nAre there any studies on this? Even if you aren't familiar with any, I'd like to hear your anecdotes, impressions, and experiences as parents or friends of parents. What was easier? Why did you like it?",

I would say to have communities where homes range from 400 sqft to 800 sqft. Put these homes on lots that range from 500sqft to 1,000sqft. \n\nThis would allow for lower price points for starter homes and would allow people to more quickly become a homeowner compared to renting. The big problem I see is there is a massive poverty trap with low-income people in the sense that they never own anything of significance. Owning a home is a great way to eventually own something valuable after 30 years. This process can't happen if the market for starter homes has effectively become out of reach.\n\nAlso from what I've seen, the demographics of the USA has shifted to the point where large homes doesn't really make sense. More people are living single and remaining unmarried for longer. More people are opting to never have kids. \n\nFrom what I've noticed, most building codes and zoning codes have effectively banned small home construction on smaller lots.",

My apologies if this is an overly obvious question but I wasn't able to find much from a quick Google search.\n\nI recently began work within the building department (distinct from zoning functions) of a relatively large American city in the Midwest. The majority of our work focuses on residential permits, and on occasion we encounter long-established homes that for whatever reason are located within industrial zoning. The homes are considered LNCUs but if the owners want to make any changes they're required to apply for costly use variances or spot rezones. Anecdotally, it appears these homeowners are generally not living in wealthy areas and are almost always unaware their homes are within industrial zones.\n\nMy questions is twofold:\n1) By what mechanism might these homes (which are on compact lots clearly designed for SFRs and presumably were built legally at the time of their construction) come to be zoned industrial? I'm broadly aware of an ugly history of packing low-income housing near undesirable uses, but would that extend to the actual zoning itself? Or is there a less nefarious explanation at play here I may have not considered?\n2) Is this an issue that might exist in other municipalities? If so, do they offer any reduction of fees or additional assistance for established homeowners in these types of situations? Fairly interested in any literature on this topic, or any work more broadly related to efforts by modern cities to address historical wrongs through zoning policy.\n\nAny context that could be offered would be much appreciated!",

It made me think that it could be useful to share ways for the public to be heard (and listened to) in public engagement from the perspective of a professional consultant working on the other side of the table.\n\n1. Representative democracy is a strong voice: Understand that a lot of the high level decisions are made through representative democracy, meaning the city councils (or equivalent) or municipal executive. These bodies set the direction in many ways, ranging from hiring staff, crafting a request for proposals, selecting a consultant, interfacing with the consultant, and final approvals. Public engagement therefore tends to only work to make decisions within in that framework that is already established.\n2. Good ideas can improve a plan early: Interact early in visioning to share your ideas about your community. Early on you can legitimately help your municipal staff and the planning consultants by providing your perspective and experience on the ground. Good ideas at this stage often make it into the final product.\n3. After a certain point, changing the plan requires an unignorable political campaign: Once a draft of a plan is prepared, it is harder to make big changes for a number of reasons, including efficiency. Consultants and municipal staff often work with the inputs from steps 1 and 2 to create a consensus or compromise solution. If your input in step 2 didn’t make it into the plan, simply repeating it in step 3 won’t make a difference. At this point, you have to become unignorable. Any change you want to see has to be treated like a political campaign, where you should form coalition, get a petition signed, flood meetings, call decision makers, all the rest. If the noise cannot be ignored, the plan will change. This does require a lot of work, so you have to make a decision about how important the change in the plan is to you.\n\nThat is about it, from my perspective at least. What do you think?",

The argument many of the NIMBYs have made is that this will overload the current traffic network, and does not come with any improvement in public transportation. Their argument is that we need better public transportation first, followed by density, so new residents are more likely to take the bus than drive. So my question is, in this case, are the NIMBYs right, in that we need better public transport to support density later, or does the density need to come first to support public transport?\n\nOn a related note, is blanket density a better policy, or should cities pursue corridor-based density instead? To me, corridor-based density seems better as it can support public transport ridership better than density in a transit desert. What do yall think?",

They are probably 10 years+ elder to me in an important, managerial role at a public agency in a major US city. For context, I am in my early 30s.\n\nI understand this is a great opportunity for career advice. But what is appropriate to share vs not share with someone at this level? Is it ok to share mental health concerns that are affecting my job? I struggle with depression/anxiety and am debating taking a career break/sabbatical for six months for the first time in my career. I would love to talk to my mentor about how to approach some of these struggles and upcoming decisions. But I fear that revealing too much might leave a negative impression of me if I ever want to work on their team in the future. They specifically mentioned that they do lean on “a good word” or recommendations from trusted colleagues when making hiring decisions (I’m surprised that happens at public agencies to be honest - from what I’ve seen, hiring at my agency is extremely methodological and there are many checks to reduce bias in the process). \n\nSo in short, what is ok to share with an industry mentor you hope to work for one day? What is oversharing? Is it ok to talk about mental health and/or personal issues if they are affecting your job or career trajectory? Lately there’s been so much talk of being open and destigmatizing mental health so I’d like to, but not sure how the middle-aged generation feels about it (aka the generation who are now managers). \n\nWould love any advice or sharing of your own mentorship experiences!",

I do a little comprehensive planning (mostly running SWOTs for the other people to then write stuff out of), but I mostly do current planning.\n\nWhat happens is, I am contracted out to lots of small towns or to county offices to administer all their zoning and subdivision laws, for short term or long term. Since starting I've worked as the sole planner at least temporarily for four towns and an entire county, including doing all text amendments, rezonings, annexations, subdivisions, special use permits and standard permits plus all enforcement, and all the various board and council work associated with this. I am often only in one of these jurisdictions a few hours a week before I am off driving to another one or have to report back to the office to sit and work on staff reports, etc, so I don't really have the ability to develop deep knowledge of any of these places. \n\nIt feels very lonesome and high pressure, I have coworkers but I never see them, and my director is spread so thin as well that I feel bad asking them questions or talking to them at all.\n\nMoreover, I am growing very wary of the legal risk and uncertainty involved in being the One Person responsible for interpreting these decades-old ordinances and making all these determinations on the tight, answer-me-now-or-I'll-go-bankrupt-and-sue-you-and-the-town timeline of the developers who call me for interpretations. \n\nMore than anything I really want to feel like I'm part of a collaborative team and not the one, single person responsible for all planning for these many towns.

Or is dedicated motorcycle infrastructure like in Taiwan and perhaps private motorised transport in general a dead-end?",

        "text": "The idea of induced demand has been discussed ad nauseum in urbanist or Transit advocate circles. The idea being that you can't improve traffic by building more roads as more roads will encourage people to drive more, thus offsetting the gains of building more roads. \n\nLos Angeles Seems to Contradict this idea. \n\nIn 2017 it apparently had the worst traffic in the world according to inrix. Los Angeles traffic is legendary \n\nhttps://inrix.com/press-releases/scorecard-2017/\n\nIn 2017 Los Angeles had some of the lowest lane miles per Capita at only 2.1 miles of road lanes per 1000 residents, not the very lowest but still low. \n\nhttps://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2017/hm72.cfm\n\nCorrelation isn't causation, but it seems to contradict the Induced Demand Theory. Building more roads might not be possible in LA due to land acquisition issues, but it seems that a lack of roads makes congestion worse not better.",

I'm about to finish a short-term contract with a municipal planning department in California in mid-January, and I've been applying to jobs back in New York (my home state). I have had some interviews, but even if I eventually get one of those positions, it may be several months before I have a start date. Any recommendations on paid short-term projects or shorter gigs that I could work on while still going through that process?\n\nFor context, I'm an early career planner and finished grad school this past spring. I am open to more general temping or working in a service role to make some income while still applying to longer-term jobs, but I was curious if there are even opportunities that might be more related to planning that I'm not thinking of. Thanks!",

        "text": "This past May, I graduated from a small liberal arts college that studies the Great Books. A little over half a year ago, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to get a master's in urban studies or planning. Since then, I've moved to Colorado and have been looking into the University of Colorado in Denver's MURP program. Unfortunately, owing to a challenging first year, my grade point average is only a hair below the minimal criterion of 3.0 that they have. I talked to admissions, and one of the things they told me to do to make my application stronger was to take the GRE (and get high scores) and take a class as a non-degree-seeking student so I could get to know the teachers. \n\nSince I got my bachelor's degree in a completely different field, I'm afraid that I'll start and feel like I'm already behind. I'm curious if any of you have thoughts or experiences about post-baccalaureate and then going to graduate school.  Any suggestions?",
