What I am interested in is is how firearms affected the formation of the KKK after the war. I hope to use a plausibly exogenous variation in terms of surrender, and link the regiments to where they were mustered. Obviously, what I’m primarily interested in is the disposition of weapons after the war, but the whole terms would be fantastic. What I know so far is that the Army of Northern Virginia kept no firearms (only sidearms), the Army of Tennessee kept 1/7th (which I believe to be randomly distributed, but I would love the original to check), and I’ve got an order going for Gen. Richard Taylor. I would very much appreciate any help finding this, or if someone knows this off the top of their head. Thanks!",

Were they any that wondered if, for example, some in their parents generation still harbored those same ideas and would gladly \"give it another go\" so to speak if the opportunity should arise? I'm particularly interested because usually parents are responsible for giving their children a moral upbringing and understanding right from wrong, whereas historically this seems like one of the cleanest cut examples where a child could righteously rebel in a \"Don't think you have any place to try to tell me what's right and wrong when you sat idly by and let that all happen\"",

I recently learned that a significant amount of that history is pulled from the Queen herself, a fact that is driven home by reading her autobiography.  Reading the draft of the unproposed [1893 Constitution](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/1893_Constitution_of_the_Kingdom_of_Hawaii) leaves me with more questions than answers, as my interpretation of the document cuts directly against the image of her that was cultivated for me.\n\n\nAs far as I can tell, the document would have expanded voting rights while ripping away the power of the vote.  It appears to be an attempt at instituting absolute monarchy, in defiance of most of the Kamehameha's precedents.\n\n\nWas she encouraged to write this Constitution because the ministers wanted this to be the law of the land?  Or did she truly believe these things as she did in [1864?](https://www.hawaii-nation.org/constitution-1864.html)\n\n\nAfter the backlash of the proposed draft, the Queen seemed to focus entirely on the Native Hawaiians. Given her pattern of ignoring the outcry for a new Constitution in the elections preceeding 1893, it seems reasonable to question her integrity with this pivot.  Is there evidence of this being genuine, or was it purely political?\n\n\n\nBonus question: why is it so difficult to find a critical account of Queen Lili'oukalani's reign?  Where can I read about that period of history from a different perspective?",

That the modern ideas of a “German people” and a “German nation” only really emerged by setting so-called “Germans” apart from the “other,” the Jewish people. But I don’t know. I’m sure it’s more complicated than that, and (as far as I recall) I wasn’t familiar with the *Völkisch* movement until about an hour ago.\n\n(I mean, to step back even further, I suppose my question could equally be “why did the Volkisch movement happen?” but that seems like a huge, broad question.)\n\nIs my premise wrong to begin with? Is there really anything unique about German anti-semitism pre-Naziism?",

Two of them were large, but the third one was tiny, yet formidable. A cultural melting pot, which held its ground more than once no matter how many bombs were thrown at it and yet, the country fell in only six days to a very famous general, who turned things around by abolishing slavery and founding many schools. That did not last however, as the country was later taken over by a cripple. That crippled would later die by a seemingly unremarkable places, besides a lighthouse and Roman baths discovered in 2021.

I'd like to read where he was coming from so I can actually understand the ideas he's talking about (my accounting knowledge is very limited, but I'm trying to understand him in the context of the evolution of market thought). Otherwise (preferably, actually), I'd also welcome any direction toward resources to help me better understand what he's saying, and I may be able to figure out my question myself. Thanks!",

X and Y laid siege to its capital, but only Y succeeded, despite X’s best efforts to stop them. Meanwhile Z’s precursor tried to do the same, came close but was ultimately unsuccessful. If you calculate the distance between the capitals of X and Z and Y and Z in kilometers you will get two, four digit numbers. Subtracting those numbers leaves you with a little over four times the length of the famous walls of the Y capital.\n2. X was a battle of new vs old, few vs the many in more ways than one. A battle where old rivals put aside their differences and fought as one. There were many participants in the side of the many but they all came from three modern countries. Two of them were large, but the third one was tiny, yet formidable. A cultural melting pot, which held its ground more than once no matter how many bombs were thrown at it and yet, the country fell in only six days to a very famous general, who turned things around by abolishing slavery and founding many schools. That did not last however, as the country was later taken over by a cripple. That crippled would later die by a seemingly unremarkable places, besides a lighthouse and Roman baths discovered in 2021. The Roman baths or Thermae are also a very important archeological site in the city of Y, which also saw a massive battle unfold as many clashed against the same few. The battle of Y, crippled many men, but it was the death of the king with four crowns that ultimately decided its outcome. One of his four crowns belonged the kingdom which was the first one outside of Italy to embrace the Renaissance, innovative in many ways one of these inventions would eventually be used in the conquest of Z.",

Throughout all of this the senate never goes away and even seems to maintain a handful of important powers, meanwhile 2 of the first 3 emperors are some of Roman history’s greatest monsters, and then not long after the entire dynasty collapsed, which I would think would give an easy opening for a republican faction to seize power.

I have also heard numerous (entirely unsubstantiated and to my mind rather specious) arguments that Americans are more 'smiley' than - for instance - Europeans because a land of immigrants required inhabitants to rely upon body language for communication where a common language was not available. Is this a longstanding explanation for American's relative 'smileyness' or is it a more recent explanation?\n\nI am specifically asking when and why these cultural traits came to be associated with Americans (by either Americans or observers from abroad). I am not asking *why* Americans do or do not embody those traits (which is an entirely separate question and much more contentious).",

Despite this ongoing series of articles mainly focusing on the investigation behind plane crashes, this one had a lot of context included to explain the significance of this incident's effect on the relatively new country. This paragraph in particular caught my eye:\n\n&gt; Now, at the age of 42, Machel took control of a nation in the most desperate condition. Most of the country’s approximately 250,000 white Portuguese had fled after FRELIMO asked that they either become citizens of Mozambique or leave within 24 hours. Аs in many other newly independent African countries, the fleeing colonizers destroyed as much infrastructure as they could on the way out, driving bulldozers into the sea, plundering factories, and filling the sewers with concrete. To make matters worse, there was no one in Mozambique who could rebuild it: 95% of the population was illiterate, and virtually no one had a college education.\n\nI figured there had to have been some damage caused by the violence that occurs with most revolutions, but I was utterly unaware of deliberate widescale sabotage by those who fled during these transitions to independence. I would like to know more about what happened and how that hurt these fledgling African nations' chances of becoming independently successful.\n\nI might have to make separate posts for some of the follow-up questions I have, but I'll list them here in case someone can direct me to existing answers:\n\n* Did any of these saboteurs that fled their former country ever get extradited and tried for their crimes?\n* Were any of the colonial nations found at fault for the damage or required to pay reparations?\n* What types of aid were provided by the UN or other sources?\n* Have any of these former African colonies recovered to their pre-revolution status?",

        "text": "I’ve been working on my family tree for nearly two decades now, and discovered that some of my paternal grandmother’s ancestors, from North Yorkshire, were Roman Catholics. They were baptized in clandestine chapels by English Jesuit priests (I have the names of two of them - Thomas Ferby and Raphael Hoskins, both listed in the Society’s directory as English Catholics who were trained in Rome and sent to the English mission in the late 18th century). What puzzles me, however, is that their Catholicism seems to have been brief. All of their baptism and marriage records until the end of the 17th century are from the Church of England, and then from the 18th through to the early 19th century they were Catholics, and all of their baptismal records are entered on the non-conformist rolls. And then from the mid-19th century (essentially from my great-great-grandparents and onward), the family is once again Anglican.\n\nI’ve read John Gerard’s “Autobiography of a Hunted Priest”, and know that not all recusant families remained Catholic from the beginning, but were apparently converted in the 16th-19th centuries by Jesuit priests sent for exactly that purpose after having embraced Anglicanism. Is that likely to have been the case for my ancestors? And are there any other resources for information about that, or specific converts in particular (I have exhausted the records on Ancestry.com). Thank you for any assistance.",
