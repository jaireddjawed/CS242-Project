        "text": "So I originally found this claim on social media, and I am struggling to come up with an explanation as to why exactly this is the case.\n\nSo if you don't know India is one of the most invaded regions in the world, arguably the most invaded. And it has a long history of colonization by Islamic powers and then Christian powers which altogether span more than 1000 years, and have very often persecuted the native population and issued forced conversions en masse. (That is why Pakistan and Bangladesh for example are Muslim nations when previously they were Hindu/Buddhist)\n\nDespite all this it's indigenous cultures and religions not only survive but remain dominant.\n\nThis didn't happen anywhere else which endured colonialism by a foreign power on such a scale.\n\nIn Africa, the Americas, Central/West Asia, Europe, the natives largely adopted foreign customs, traditions, languages, culture, and the religions of the colonialists. \n\nSo why didn't any of this happen in India? Why do it's native religions and cultures remain dominant? \n\nAlso, it's not just Hinduism. It seems to be every native religion which arose in the Indian subcontinent. (Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism, plus all the other different sects and minor religions, as well as the tribal faiths)\n\nAnother thing, this is also the case with the slaves taken from India to the Caribbean, Africa, and Polynesia. They all still practice their native beliefs and cultures as well. \n\nAny ideas as to why?",

        "text": "I am seeking more statistics  that goes more in-depth into the reasons that men are committing suicide following divorce for monetary reasons.  Thank you in advance  \n\n\n\"They were nearly 9.7 times more likely to kill themselves than  comparable divorced women (RR = 9.68, 95% CI = 4.87 to 19.22). Put  another way, for every divorced woman that committed suicide, over nine  divorced men killed themselves.\"  \n\n\n\"As Perrault[3](https://jech.bmj.com/content/57/12/993#ref-3) and Farrell[4](https://jech.bmj.com/content/57/12/993#ref-4)  observe, while social, psychological, and even personal problems facing  women are readily denounced, societal institutions tend to ignore or  minimize male problems as evident in suicide statistics. For instance,  in many jurisdictions in the US there seems to be an implicit assumption  that the bond between a woman and her children is stronger than that  between a man and his children.[5](https://jech.bmj.com/content/57/12/993#ref-5)  As a consequence, in a divorce settlement, custody of children is more  likely to be given to the wife. In the end, the father loses not only  his marriage, but his children. The result may be anger at the court  system especially in situations wherein the husband feels betrayed  because it was the wife that initiated the divorce, or because the  courts virtually gave away everything that was previously owned by the  ex-husband or the now defunct household to the former wife. Events could  spiral into resentment (toward the spouse and “the system”),  bitterness, anxiety, and depression, reduced self esteem, and a sense of  “life not worth living”. As depression and poor mental health are known  markers of suicide risk, it may well be that one of the fundamental  reasons for the observed association between divorce and suicide in men  is the impact of post divorce (court sanctioned) “arrangements”. Clearly  this is an issue that needs further investigation.\"  \n\n\nSource:  \n\n\n[https://jech.bmj.com/content/57/12/993](https://jech.bmj.com/content/57/12/993)",

But is it a fantasy or overstretch to say that psychotherapy will transform human societies?  \n\nPsychology is very underrated but the most important tool for civilization. For eg, lots of family violence can be solved if people just are initiated, do self reflection, understand their childhood trauma, practice other ways of reaction etc. Lots of religious violence can be solved if people are not brainwashed since young age, their emotional needs are met, they are not manipulated to adhere to myth, stories and legends. Lots of people live with undiagnosed mental illnesses. \n\nSo, can psychotherapy bring universal peace? I think that all humans dont do self development as the same pace.

She pointed out that the cohort of 1989-2003 showed no such increase. Of course, not everyone took this lying down, and one of the commenters, Dean Jackson, posted a  counterargument that I'm having trouble parsing, which I will quote directly.\n\n&gt;differences in mortality disappeared, she never specified **suicide**, suicide rates being the topic at hand.... the attempts at suicide for SRS recipients have normalized with the general   \npopulation because the attempts have become more successful, and such   \nattempts at suicide are more successful for SRS recipients than the   \ngeneral population thanks to the handy convenience of the   \nanti-depressive medications SRS recipients have access to\n\nHe also claims that the study did not include any of the data from the 1989-2003 cohort, save for the Hazard Ratio which only describes time between treatment and hazardous event. I thought he was referring to raw data, but I couldn't find the raw data for either cohort. He claims this was to cover up an increased suicide rate, but I find that unlikely.\n\nNow, as other people in the comments pointed out, one has to *attempt* suicide to commit suicide. And at a glance, while the hazard ratio doesn't sort out types of death by cohort due to sparse data, the fact that mortality has normalized alongside suicide attempts makes it unlikely that successful suicide attempts have significantly increased. Otherwise the implication is that transitioning makes one less likely to die from a cardiovascular disease or neoplasm than the controls. He also quotes the study's conclusion \"This study found substantially higher rates of overall mortality, etc.\" ad nauseam, and acts like Dhejne's claims about the more recent cohort came out only during the interview when they're actually noted frequently in the study. He appears to be hung up on Dhejne noting an increased rate of suicide and mortality in that cohort while ignoring the fact that it wasn't statistically significant.\n\nNow, this largely seems pretty cut and dry to me, but I'm not a scientist, so I feel obligated to run this by someone first.",

Since prevalence of dysphoria is listed at 0.005% to 0.014% for adult... well, he says \"Males,\" but I believe this statistic largely encompasses trans women, and 0.002% to 0.003% for trans men in the DSM-5, even if only a tenth of this 6% is dysphoric, it represents a 4,300% and 30,000% increase in less than a decade, both much larger and much faster than a 300% over the course of 60 years for left-handedness.\n\nNow, there are obvious problems here. #1 is that this 6% statistic is specifically localized to Davis, CA which is a highly limited sample. Granted, I ran the numbers through a more representative prevalence estimate of 1.4% of under-18s ([shown here](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/)) and that would still probably make for a pretty huge increase even if a tenth of that sample was dysphoric. #2 however, is that even if I grant all this, none of it means that transgender identity is actually a social contagion as characterized here. That being said, doesn't this still distinguish trans identity's increasing prevalence from that of left-handedness?",

        "text": "It's a common (and frustrating) idea in Europe that America is much more racist than Europe. I get the impression this is because American racism seem to be very fixated on skin colour, which is visible and therefore more openly identifiable, where European racism is based on cultural identity whereby groups are racialised, but isn't immediately identifiable. So, Poles are racialised and experience racism in Europe and the Irish are a post-colonial people whose genocide at the hands of the British state is often made light of, but I imagine if either tried to claim as such in the States they'd be told to shut up as they are very clearly visually white-skinned. On the other hand, I have seen dark-skinned Spaniards or Italians being identified as a Latino in the States and face aggression that they wouldn't in, for example, Belgium. I understand that in the case of people of African descent, racism is a part of their life no matter where they are.\n\nThis is based on observation rather than scientific literature, so I could very much be wrong, but I was wondering, if this is true, why?",

Brexit and increasing transphobia in the UK, the planned insurrection in Germany, Brazil’s recent January 6th, Poliviere and the convoy stuff in Canada, the election of far-right government and politicians in what seemed to have been socially/economically healthy regions (Israel, Italy, *Sweden*, etc,.). \n\nIt doesn’t even seem to be amongst financially-disadvantaged folk anymore (i.e. those in poor rural areas of the country), even financially privileged middle-upper class folk seem to fall in the wheel of the far-right. \n\nWhat’s going on? Why is this happening all across the world now? If even good social programs and healthy democracies can’t seem to stop far-right issues in the modern age, then what can?

        "text": " \n\nThis will sound incredibly stupid and laughable, but I'd like to know people's thoughts, especially those more knowledgeable than me. Excuse any case of bad grammar, I didn’t put that much effort. Here is my reasoning for wanting to become a vigilante:\n\nOver these past few years, I have seen a lack of empathy and understanding in many areas of our society, especially for those suffering from mental health issues, trauma, poverty, homelessness, etc. I have come to the conclusion that there is not enough support or understanding for victims or mentally ill people.\n\nAdditionally, justice from the system doesn’t always win, unfortunately. The police, government, and other agencies often have to prioritize mandates, rules, and regulations above the suffering and needs of victims or the stories of perpetrators. From this, it is clear that we can't rely on the police or the government for everything, and that we all have to stand up for each other. Independent methods can help build close relations with victims and assist the police by finding evidence for them.\n\nI don't believe simple enforcement of the law is enough to combat crime and other issues in society. I don’t want feed the cycle of enforcement. I also don’t think I can do everything on my own, I just want to be an extra pair of eyes. I could never be better than or replace the police.\n\nI plan on patrolling obscure areas where there aren't going to be many people, and supporting victims and their families however I can. I will obviously not immediately take sides or assume anything. I plan on using several investigative techniques to gain an understanding of victims, perpetrators, and events. I plan on getting a job in law enforcement so that I can gain experience, build connections, view resources, and make a change from both inside and outside the system.\n\nI also plan on using a non-violent approach, deescalating conflicts verbally, and only fighting if the other person attacks first. I will wear a body cam to record encounters, and I will inform the police as soon as I can. In general, I will not kill, vandalize, brutally beat or assault, trespass, use any weapons that are prohibited, follow all the laws pertaining to everything I plan on doing, gain an understanding of topics like criminology and law, and buy the necessary equipment.\n\nI have protection laid out that will help me a great deal, even against knives. I will still definitely get hurt or possibly killed, but I am not afraid of death.\n\nI believe vigilantism can help others and make a difference, and I would train myself to be prepared to do all of these things over several years. Let me know what you think, even if you think it’s bullshit.",

        "text": "[A study was recently published](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D97pYGVT4mxe8vSTc-32uNNYAG6rxean/view?usp=sharing) claiming that the results of the 2011 and 2014 Dutch studies should be unilaterally discarded. It is in response to de Vries' own response to a study from the previous year which levied three primary criticisms at the paper's finding of reduced dysphoria.\n\n1. All of the most mentally unhealthy subjects were weeded out by nature of the selection process for the study. If any of those subjects had been harmed by the blocker phase, they wouldn't have proceeded to hormones and thus would have been excluded from both studies. The consecutive referral criteria also skewed the group older than usual. Carmichael et al., 2021 use prospective case selection and found no improvements.\n2. The fact that post-treatment subjects were given the UGDS for their identified gender, whereas their initial assessment used their AGAB, invalidates any findings regarding resolution of dysphoria. If both were given at baseline, for example, to a highly dysphoric youth, one would likely produce maximum scores while the opposite gender would produce the minimum. The dysphoria would seemingly disappear with no treatment, and this confounding element makes it impossible to determine the actual effect on dysphoria.\n3. Other scales used, despite showing significant improvement, were all actually quite modest in their findings, and it's impossible to disentangle the effects of concurrent psychotherapy from the medical treatments of blockers, hormones, and surgery.\n\nThe study goes on other tangents about health risks and recent cohort changes that I personally find unconvincing and uninteresting, as well as some quick criticism of Costa (2015) for not finding statistically significant differences between puberty blockade and psychotherapy treatments.  However, these are the main three points I want to get some answers on. Do they hold up?\n\nThere are some odd aspects I noted that I think speak to a clear slant in the framing of the study. \"Evidence was starting to demonstrate that gender reassignment undertaken in adulthood failed to resolve trans people’s mental health problems (Cohen-Kettenis &amp; Van Goozen, 1997).\" While it is just the abstract, that study notes a complete lack of regret and resolution of dysphoria among its 22 participants. Not to mention his framing of transition as a \"lifelong burden.\"\n\nOn the whole, Levine definitely seems to have gone in with a bone to pick, and while researchers can't help but have opinions, I feel like I need a second one before I take what he has to say at face value.",

As an adult separated from organized religion, I have found it difficult to find a similar sense of community. Sure, I can be part of a university or sports team or some other group, but the bond produced by shared religion simply isn't there. That's not to say that a bond of that strength can't be formed, just that it seems a lot harder to reach.

        "text": "Here's the Economist article that makes this claim: [https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/01/05/pay-transparency-laws-do-not-work-as-advertised](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/01/05/pay-transparency-laws-do-not-work-as-advertised)\n\nRelevant parts:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Labour advocates champion pay-transparency laws on the grounds that they  will narrow pay disparities. But research suggests that this is  **achieved not by boosting the wages of lower-paid workers but by curbing  the wages of higher-paid ones**. A forthcoming paper by economists at the  University of Toronto and Princeton University estimates that Canadian  salary-disclosure laws implemented between 1996 and 2016 **narrowed the  gender pay gap of university professors by 20-30%.** But there is also  evidence that they lower salaries, on average. Another paper by  professors at INSEAD, UNC Chapel Hill,  Cornell and Columbia University found that a Danish pay-transparency law  adopted in **2006 shrank the gender pay gap by 13%, but only because it  curbed the wages of male employees.** Studies of Britain’s gender-pay-gap  law, which was implemented in 2018, have reached similar conclusions.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[...\\]  the effects of 13 state laws passed between 2004 and 2016 that were  designed to protect the right of workers to ask about the salaries of  their co-workers. The authors found that **the laws were associated with a  2% drop in wages,** an outcome which the authors attribute to reduced  bargaining power. “Although the idea of pay transparency is to give  workers the ability to renegotiate away pay discrepancies, it actually  shifts the bargaining power from the workers to the employer,” says Mr  Pakzad-Hurson. “So wages are more equal,” explains Ms Cullen, “but  they’re also lower.” \n\nIs this viewpoint mainstream, or the article cherry-picks studies that support their claim? Or something in between? If true, do we understand the mechanism of these results?\n\nThank you!",

I've slowly been developing a hypothesis in my head but it's hard to articulate, so apologies if it doesn't make much sense. Here it goes;\n\nIt seems like, especially in the modern era but for a large portion of our history as a species, we go from cradle to grave with someone telling us how to think and how to behave. Ostensibly this is because humans aren't competent on their own and require someone to keep them on the proper course. But is this a self-fulfilling prophecy? Some may be hesitant to allow people more independent lifestyles for fear of belief in pseudoscience and fake news, which I understand completely. But that's a huge problem *now.* Is it because people have too much independence or not enough? Perhaps people fall into these traps not because they followed their own path, but because a charismatic figure told them it was the right way, or because their parents did, or something else like that.\n\nIf people are consistently raised to make their own desicions and given a large degree of autonomy, are they more successful in their later years? Are they more or less likely to believe in pseudoscience and fake news? How successful are sudbury schools and other democratic education schemes that focus on giving children freedom?",

If they have to work in mines to earn barely enough to live day to day. Why not gather the money and resources to build a business in the congo. All the business profit would go to the people maybe in a wage share type system. Then the charity could make sure that the working conditions are met, pay is equal to or better than the living wage in the country and Help grow the community from there.\n\nEven if the charity had to start with Clean water and housing for workers.
