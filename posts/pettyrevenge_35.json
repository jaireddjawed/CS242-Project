She argued back she was using what the dish would need to be wrapped safe and securely. He tells her if it were her foil, she wouldn’t be using that much. \n\nSo now, for the past 17 years, if they host Thanksgiving, my mom ALWAYS brings her own roll of foil, and makes eye contact with my uncle as she wraps her things. She will never let it go!",

        "text": "A friend suggested I post this here. This happened a couple of years ago. I (28f) was dating Max (29M) for 5 years. We were full on together. We lived together, shared finances, had 2 dogs, etc. My best friend Amy (28f) lived 10 minutes away so we were always with each other. We were pretty much the three musketeers. \n\nOne day I’m scrolling on instagram and I see my boyfriend in the background of a picture posted to our local bars page. He was supposed to be at work and I’d never been given a reason not to trust him so I figured it was an older picture as we go there a couple times a month. But when he got home he was wearing the same blue button up and jeans. I had a horrible feeling in my stomach but I didn’t say anything. \n\nThat night I went through his phone, yeah yeah I know but idc. We’ve always shared passwords and have never had an issue with using each others phones. When I checked his messages I saw a chain with someone named “Jack”. We didn’t know a Jack, so I read through them and my heart just fucking breaks. I’ve known my best friend since we were in diapers, I know how she texts. But I checked the number just to be sure and yep, they were talking behind my back. Not just talking though, there were pictures and mentions of sexual acts that had happened. I spent the night crying and sending myself all of the screen shots and everything I could find. \n\nBy morning, I realized that I can’t just confront them. I need to prepare. So I set out to put money aside. I tell him our fridge is broken so I’m using some of our savings to fix it, we need a plumber for this or a handyman for that. All lies but I needed a reason to pull money out of the account we both had access to. It took me 2 months but I was able to pull enough out to put a deposit and pay a couple months in advance on a new apt that I found that was closer to work and pet friendly. I was able to slowly move stuff there while he was at work ( I told him I was doing some spring cleaning to clear out the clutter). \n\n\nIn the mean time I fucked with their heads. I’d mention things about each other that would cause drama, like telling Max that Amy talked about a cute guy from work, or telling Amy that Max mentioned marriage and kids with me (she’s infertile due to a childhood illness). \n\nThe day before I was leaving I set my plan onto motion. I knew where my best friend went for lunch most days of the week so I watched and waited. When she arrived I went in and pretended I didn’t want to throttle her for breaking my trust and my heart. We sat down and chatted and I slyly mentioned sex with Max. In their messages she told him that she didn’t want him to sleep with me, apparently she’d become quite possessive of my bf. I made comments about how sore I was because we did it rough just like I like it. How good he was at oral, you name it I mentioned it. Her face got redder and redder and it was amazing to watch. \n\nI’d seen her react that way before but I never realized why. She’d always insist on watching late night movies with us or ask to sleep on our couch instead of going home and be mad when I had to say no I want to have privacy with my bf. I just thought she was lonely or a little clingy but I never would have imagined she didn’t want to leave because she wanted to make sure we weren’t having sex. \n\nLater that day I go home and once again pretend that everything is normal. But I sit down on the couch with him and snuggle up to him while he watches tv. After about 20 minutes I straddle him and ask him how his day was and blah blah blah. Then I bring up that I ran into Amy at lunch and “You’ll never guess who she was with!” I told him how Amy was with Dave (her real life coworker that has hung out with us multiple times) and how it’s so cute that they’re dating now. \n\nWhen I say he froze, I don’t think he even breathed. He just sort of muttered, “ I didn’t know she was seeing someone.” So I tell him all about how I caught them kissing and after Dave left to go back to work Amy told me all about their amazing sex life. And of course I had to add in there that Dave was the first guy to give her a real O and how’s she’s always had to fake it with guys before. \n\nI’ve never seen him look so dejected before. That night I asked that we do a phone free night, which we’d do often so that we could be in our own bubble. I could tell that he was a little hesitant but he turned his phone off and put it in the basket we use for it. We watched a movie and cuddled on the couch and he stayed as stiff as a board for the majority of it before he relaxed enough to fall asleep on the couch. \n\nOnce he was out, I grabbed his work phone and sent out a contact list wide email about how I may be in a bad mood for the next couple of weeks because my mistress gave me the clap, then I changed the pass code on it and turned it off.  I knew that he wouldn’t turn it on until he got to his worksite that was 40 minutes away. As soon as he was out the door I immediately packed my bags, important papers and the dogs and left. I also unscrewed most lightbulbs, took the batteries out of the remote, took the router plug in so he wouldn’t have Wi-Fi and cranked the AC up to 80F. When I got to my new place, I sent her a text asking how my p***y tastes and then blocked them both.  Then I posted screenshots to my fb and let everyone know what horrible people they were.",

        "text": "OK so I need some advice cause I'm not sure if this is crossing lines. \nSo I had this friend (both F16) who we'll called Elle (fake name) we'd been friend since the end of 6th grade and she was one of my favorite people on the planet. \n\nShe was always so cheerful but she was very suicidal. I always did everything I could to help her so last year she told me how she no longer believed in the Mormon religion which she was raised in. I was ecstatic because if you know anything about that religion you know it's a cult. She's also bi and the church is very homophobic. \n\nWe came up with a plan that if her parents ever found out and kicked her out that she could come live with me. My mom and I kept a room avaliable for her. \n\nHer mental health sky rocketed after that and to celebrate I made her a scrapbook with letter from all her friends and family and took her to Disneyland for my 16th birthday along with 2 other friends (they only paid for half of their tickets) \n\nAfter that trip Elle became very distant along with the rest of our friend group. I would try to make plans but no one would reply and they would always hangout without me. \n\nI texted her one day about how I felt terrible cause I felt like everyone was leaving me and how I was struggling cause my Nana passed away and she replied with telling me how Disneyland was the worst thing that's ever happened to her. \n\nHow I didn't pay enough attention to her (I was trying to spend time with them and my family) how I was selfish (I wanted the only blanket we had and stretched it across them as well) and how I was so childish (we were at Disneyland... and that's just a personality trait) and how I was so mean (I was stressed because I was trying to help my mom with my siblings F1 M6 months) \n\nSome of the stuff was very personal so I don't want to add them here. I tried to apologize for being stressed but she just went on about how terrible of a person I am. \n\nIt then got to how one of our old friends was spreading some rumor about me that was very fake but Elle believed her and turned everyone against me. I had never felt worse. I lost all of my friends of 5+ years because of a Disneyland trip and a girls lies. My mom held me as I cried for so long I almost threw up. I was already at rock bottom and she just dug a hole for me. \n\nIt's been 5 months and it's starting to get better. Elle helped frame me for something that made me look like I was going to hurt the girl that started the rumor and I had to leave school and ended up dropping out. My family moved states to get away. I started having nightmares with my old friends in them and had to get on a medication. \n\nI left a jacket at Elles house and I've been debating asking her mom if I could come and get it but I can only imagine the fake stuff she's told her. My mom mentioned showing Elle's mom the texts but I said I didn't want to because I mention her leaving the church in them but my mom said that since Elle destroyed my life it's only fair to return the favor. \n\nI haven't done anything yet, I need someone else's opinion.",

        "text": "So, I (25F) and my husband (26M) bought a brand new car 5 years ago. It was for my husband, but I contributed half of the funds for it and we are joint owners.\n\nOn the day we picked it up from the dealership, my husband was so excited. I asked if I could drive it and he said no. At the time I just figured it was because he was excited to have a car that was only his, so I didn’t think too much of it.\n\nThat afternoon we went to my sister’s house to show her and my BIL the car. We pulled up and they were saying how nice it was and that it must drive like a dream! My sister sat in the driver’s seat and put her hand out expectedly. My husband, without a second thought, placed the keys in her hand and didn’t say a word as she drove off with her partner in the front seat.\n\nI watched them pull away in shock, and simply said, “Are you kidding me?” And I saw the moment of realisation on my husband’s face as he realised what he had just done.\n\nI was so pissed off, and a little hurt, that I wouldn’t listen as he apologised and swore that he just wasn’t thinking. I said it was fine, if he was so against me driving the car but no issues with anyone else driving it, I would just never drive it.\n\n5 years later, and my petty self still hasn’t let it go. He wants to have a couple drinks and have me drive his car home since we brought it out? Nope sorry, I can’t drive your car. Want to go on an interstate trip and share the driving? We better take my car since I can’t drive yours.\n\nMy husband has just accepted this at this point and it’s more of an inside joke between us, but it recently came up again because we were baby sitting my nephew and I asked my husband if he could switch the car seat from his car to mine and my sister suggested that I just take his car because it already had the seat. I said that wouldn’t work because I’m not allowed to drive his car. She said oh my god, you’re still not over that?!\n\nNo Sarah, apparently I’m not.",

We were at an officer camp where we’d learn a dance during the day, practice it until 1-2 am and then perform it the next day. So we were practicing at night when our director brings out a platter of chick fil a nuggets and cookies. We ate all the nuggets and there were a majority of cookies left. Well, she found one hair on some of the cookies, picked it of, and then put all the cookies on a separate platter and declared them to be ours. We thought this was rude so while she wasn’t looking we switched the cookies! Well, she caught us because of course she did, and what ensued next was horrifying. She became enraged and started yelling at us that we need to be grateful and that there were starving children in Africa (we’re in the us). She then proceeded to force the 6 of us to eat the entire platter of about 25 cookies on full stomachs to the point we were gagging and one of the others almost threw up. Mind you, this was in front of an entire ballroom of other teams practicing. She then forced us to dance again, shaming us for not being as good as before. The next day she posted pictures of us holding up the platters smiling (before all this went down) and used the hashtags #onemorecookieplease and #begrateful. \n\nNow she had always hated me so I decided to get back at her my senior year. We had this tradition where each senior would decorate a brick in her office to memorialize their time there. So naturally I decorated mine with the “inspiring” quote of #begrateful with a cookie sticker hidden in the corner. I hope she never forgets how horribly she treated us and never again treats anyone, especially a minor, like she treated us.",

        "text": "While lurking in this group I was recently reminded of something I could share. Yay!\n\nWay back in the mid 1980s in Australia my Dad would stop at the local pub or squash court for a beer before coming home. Mum, my younger sister and I would be at the dinner table eating dinner. If Dad was late he would call home and ask Mum to put his dinner in the oven so he could reheat it when he got home. He didn't do this very often and the pub/squash courts were literally up the road from us, about 3 doors up and across the street.\n\nSo one Summer evening us girls were just about to eat dinner at our usual time (which Dad was aware of, his work was over our back fence at a dairy co-op). He rang from the pub and said he will be a little late and put his dinner in the oven and reheat it, he was on his way. Mum was a little annoyed as his squash and beer stops had increased a little this week. Her reply on the phone was \"Yes, I'll do that\" and hung up.\n\nAs I said we were in Australia so we get very warm and humid Summers. Mum had placed his dinner in the oven and reheated it like he asked. Dad came home and said hello then headed off to the kitchen to get his dinner. It was ruined, Dad didn't know we had cold cuts and salad for dinner that night.",

        "text": "This is our family dog's revenge.\n\nWhen my brothers were both teenagers (back in the late '70s), we had a yellow lab dog that loved to play fetch. She was a great dog, a typical goofy, good hearted yellow lab in the middle of a house full of 5 kids, no one really paid attention to her being around, but she was always there keeping an eye on us. \n\nOne night, my brothers and their friends were in the driveway behind the house, drinking a LOT of beer. (Back then, at 17/18 yrs old it was allowable at home as long as no one drank and drove. My mom was ok, and would stuff food into them so they weren't totally blasted, take their keys, keep an eye on them and let them crash on the floor or couch. At least she knew where they were, and most of their parents did too, as they had hosted similar crash parties. Dad was a second shift worker and got home at around 1am.) At least 48 beers were had by the group according to the total I heard, all different kinds.\n\nNext to the driveway there is a steep slope that led to a wooded area almost no one went, so they were chucking their empties down there. Then they all passed out in the house or cars. Apparently the dog was upset because no one would play with her, so after everyone was gone, she snuck out of the house, and \"retrieved\" every single one of those empties, *and laid them all out on the front lawn in full view of the street*. My dad walked by them and never saw them in the dark, but when my brothers woke up in the morning, they nearly had identical heart attacks at the sight of all those beer cans on the lawn in front of the house. They rushed out to pick them all up before my dad woke up, with raging massive hangovers. Dad found out - because people had driven by and seen them on the front lawn and made comments about my parents having a party, and of course my brothers got into trouble. \n\nThat dog was legendary. So that's how we all learned how to \"bribe\" the dog when we were doing something we shouldn't.",

I threw the glove to the ground, kicked it, picked it up, threw it down again. Then, in a rage.\n\n“Fuck Baseball!” I sent the glove flying end over end into the thicket and it disappeared with a crackle of branches and a soft thud. \n\nSurely, it was gone forever. \n\nI was 12 and 7th grade was hard enough without my insane mother rifling through my bedroom absolutely convinced I was on drugs over a ‘D’ in Math. \n\nAfter a few hours she took a break to pour another glass of Costco wine. Seeing my only opportunity I managed to smuggle my porn stash of magazines and VHS tapes past her and outside, away from prying eyes. \n\n“Here’s your drugs, bitch!” I smirked to myself as I tossed the sack of tits and ass end over end and into the oblivion bush.\n\nThere was no way she would find them. They were gone forever. \n\nI was 14 and my hypocrite weasel of a Step-Father had once again grounded me for “mouthing off.” \n\nReally, it was because I had opened our dusty copy of the Bible and a Polaroid of his mistress dressed in nothing but a Santa hat came tumbling out at my Moms feet. \n\nThe jerk off needed an excuse, I guess.\n\nAnyway, while they were busy screaming and spitting and breaking wedding pictures and having their bi weekly slapping match I was locked in my room watching a documentary on the History Channel about psychological warfare.\n\n“Cheat on my Mom? Ground me? Fuck you.” I stood once again in front of the black hole thicket and remorselessly hurled his left slipper into it. \n\nLet me tell you that from point forward, his left slipper went missing…a lot. And let me also tell you that he blamed the dog, a lot.\n\nSorry Wags. Eat shit, Pat.\n\nI was 16 and homecoming had been a disaster. So there, in the rain, in my suit and bow tie, I dramatically threw my newly ex girlfriends corsage and my handful of expired wallet condoms into the void. Gone forever, just like that relationship.\n\nI was 18 the summer after graduation and with the parents on vacation I seized my opportunity to have a gigantic party. Everyone was there, everyone was drunk or high and everyone threw their bottles into the bush because you know, evidence. The night went off without a hitch and the parents were none the wiser. \n\nI moved. Went to college. Got Married. We had a son.\n\nI was 34 when I moved home with my family to rent my childhood home and help out my Mom with the house repairs and the massive mess of yard work the previous renters had left. \n\nWouldn’t you know it? Clearing out that thicket was on the list.\n\nThis last summer, I was 38 when my 8 year old son walked up to me, rotting slipper and baseball glove in hand. \n\n“What’s this? I found it on trash hill.” He asked.\n\n“Oh son, that’s just a pile of your Dads’ petty childhood revenge.” I said, cracking a beer. “I’ll give you 5 bucks to clean all that shit up and not tell Grandma.” \n\n“Deal!”\n\nBest 5 bucks I ever spent.",

While we we sitting there waiting a car full of teenagers pulled into the lot and parked between several other vehicles.  Since it was a large mall, with a large full lot, we were parked a ways away from any pedestrians or other obvious onlookers.  The teenagers got out of their car and... well one of them decided he needed to piss.  So he did.  This must’ve started a bit of a competition because then they all started doing it.  But one guy in particular, who happened to have been the driver got creative.  We watched him yellow stream across the hoods of several adjacent vehicles, which admittedly, was pretty impressive.  The boys laughed and proceeded into the mall.  We sat there a few more minutes in silence and then my brother, who happened to work for a tire company, quietly got out of our car, walked over to the teens vehicle and proceeded to remove the valve stems from all four of their tires.",

Her reasons to throw me out 4 days prior to Thanksgiving were that someone said I was talking about her behind her back at work and claiming she told me about a moldy cup. There’s no notice ever delivered to rectify anything. How I plan to take revenge when I leave in 13 days since she has decided to make my last days here a living hell:\n\n\nSo first thing is first, I’m taking the shower curtain, hooks, liner, shower rod, and shower caddy, and those are all going in the trash. I purchased them I have a right to throw them away. \n\nNext, I’m going to take all the dishes, silverware, and any pots or pans I purchased and they’re going right in the dumpster and I’m going to break the dishes before I throw them away, just in case she tries to retrieve them from the dumpster. After that, I’m going to take the kitchen table which I bought my TV which is in the living room the shelf that’s in the living room and there’s are coming with me.\n\nThe coffee table that I bought I’m going to take apart and throw in the trash. And to make matters even better I fully intend on leaving the Internet on an extra week so I have to go in entire week without Internet. \n\nI will also be throwing out the broom and mop, as well as the toilet brush and the plunger, because I bought those.\n\nAfter fully moving out, I have every intention of taking her to small claims for prorated rent plus a Nintendo switch that came up missing.\n\nSo, essentially, by the time I’m done, she won’t have any dishes, won’t have a way to take a shower, won’t have a kitchen table and chairs won’t have a way to watch TV, won’t have Internet. She wanted to be my life difficult I’m gonna make it just as difficult.",

        "text": "This isn’t me, I’m the little sister. My sister passed about 6 months ago and one thing I loved about her was how petty she was. Well this story is one my favorites. She had set me up with this guy who I dated for almost 8 years. My sister thought he was a good guy and thought because of who his ex was the rumors were not true that he was an abusive person. \n\nWhen I was 19 I had came over to my sisters house. She had just gotten home from taking the kids to school and I met her in the yard. That morning I’d again gotten into a fight with my ex and he had gotten violent. I had a bruise on my eye and down my cheek. I had come to get some time with her. She looked at me, asked what happened and I’d reluctantly let her in and explained what was going on. Further more he didn’t know that I was there and I was scared he was gonna find out. \n\nOh bless the souls of the goddess that was in that wonderful woman. She find out why he and I had gotten into this fight and how it had escalated. My sister helped me pack that day and get my stuff into my car. \n\nAs this is going on my sister is going around the house and just taking small items. She took all the good lighters, she took all of the tooth paste tubes that were not open and left the almost empty one. She left him with a 1/4 roll of toilet paper and taking the last of the package. She took the salt and salt shaker, mostly because it was a pretty shaker. Also the pepper shaker. Leaving only the pepper in the box. Which mind you he hated using those for pepper. The only thing I knew she took was the TP and I wasn’t returning that lol. \n\nNeedless to say this woman here was already my hero before this…but god damnit she was definitely my superhero after this. I got several message and calls from my ex later that night asking about these said items. I told him I didn’t know every time. After the last call I had yelled “Look man idk wtf happened to the shit I fucking bought anyways. So stop calling me!” I hung up the phone and my older sister…the bitch is laughing. I ask her what was funny and she informed me what she did. No I didn’t tell him.",

        "text": "So this is less about my landlord and more about my roommates.  I've posed on this living situation before, recently in fact, but this situation happened near the end of my college career. \n\nI (22m) lived with 4 guys, and the occasional roommates girlfriends, things were never great but this situation spiraled out of control when one roommate wanted his brother to move in with us.  We had a room but we had no idea how these two would act once living together.  They both lifted, a lot.  Everyday, like 6 meals a day and they were huge.  Their personalities, over the weeks / months became more and more intense.  This was the age of one home phone and I had a small roofing business set up, one man crew, and I would get calls at the house.  I'd asked if messages could be taken when I wasn't available, all they had to do was write a name an number on a white board and I'd follow up.  \n\nOne evening I came home and I asked about a message I couldn't read.  Next thing I know I've got the white board ripped off the wall and both of these muscle-bound freaks are chasing me, one had a damn bat down the stairs to my area of the house.   Once down stairs I had little to defend myself aside from just turning and facing them and forcing something.  They threw the white board at me and threatened me with the bat if my expectation was for them to take messages.  I survived but was very shaken.  \n\nI brought this up with the other roommates and agreed something had to be done. \n\nRevenge is sweet.   I decided to go have a meeting with the property management company and just lay it all out there.  I detailed what happened and offered a solution.  Evict us!  All of us!  Just mail us a letter to get the fuck out and we'll clean and fix the place up and we'll all move out.  Then, after everyone is gone, I'll pull back in with my other 2 roommates and move back in.  \n\nThe plan required some work, but me and the other roommate were all in to get these other 3 out.  If you're counting that means there was another one we wanted out as well, and you'd be right.  The other roommate was a pig and didn't clean anything so we took the opportunity to get him out as well.  \n\nThe letter arrived and we all bitched and bitched about having to find other places to live, clean, fix holes due to the whiteboard incident etc.  But these 2 muscle-bound dudes pitched in and helped.  I moved all my crap into a trailer in the driveway and waited for everything to be moved out.  \n\nThe last day of the month cam and they were gone!  They'd found a new apartment together and I moved back in with one roommate and I got the lease moved into my name :-)  We looked for acceptable new roommates and found a good few guys and all was good.  \n\nI heard from a common friend that the 2 brothers found out rather quickly that it was all a setup to get them out.....they were piiisssseeedddd!  hahahahaha  I couldn't have been happier, honestly, it was one of the greatest feelings I've ever had!! Assholes finally got what they deserved!  That said, it was a rather small town and I was kinda freaked out for several months that they'd show up at the house or I'd see them out.  I could run a lot faster, but damn if they managed to get a hold of me.....lol",

        "text": "Hello all. I'm not sure if this counts as petty revenge or not, but here we go. A few years ago I was seeing this guy, it wasn't exclusive but we knew there were other people. For the sake of the story, he's my boyfriend. He had kids and pretty chill baby mama, I was cool with her and she was cool with me. Basically as long as I don't mistreat the kids she was fine, but I was seen as the \"cool family friend.\" But I digress, one day my boyfriend told me that he had the kids for the day and was going to Chuck E Cheese, for a day of mediocre pizza and cake. So I decided to go to his baby mother's house to have a relaxing spa day/shit talking session, so imagine my surprise when I go over there and see the kids playing in the yard. She asked why I came over with masks and wine and I told her. Cue all the confusion and trying to contact him. He finally answers after 30 minutes and says that he's with me. While I'm standing beside her, silently fuming over the lies. After me and her talk and calm down, I go back to my boyfriend's place and go crazy. I cut off of the labels on the canned items in the pantry, except the dog food, took the knobs off the stove, switched the wires on the cable box, TV and Blu-ray player, took all remote batteries, loosened faucets, took the microwave plate and oven racks out, loosened lightbulb and flipped the main breaker. I didn't bother the pets or their food. After all of that I went back home, blocked him and called the baby mama. And after all of that, she's a friend and he's a distant memory. That is one story that I've been called petty over by his friends and family, but I don't think so. \n\nI will answer any other questions for clarification in the comments.",

        "text": "I live in a townhouse complex. Everyone has 2 parking spots spots directly in front of their townhome. \n\nI only have one vehicle. My (60-ish kooky) neighbor only has one car. She parks to the far side of her spaces. This results in a lot of extra space in front of our places - which everyone finds tempting to use despite my asking them to park on the other side of my car or in visitor parking. \n\nEver since I moved in a year ago she would leave me notes, text me, or come to the door anytime anyone I knew - or even didn’t - parked in her spot even just to drop something off. Even if they’re only a few inches over the line for a minute she’ll yell out the window. \n\nI’ve told everyone I know not to ever park there. Even delivery drivers. Sometimes unfortunately delivery people still do at times. \n\nNow it’s winter and there’s snow. Today my dad had to pull forward into her spot to back into visitor parking. This resulted in a slew of texts about how his car resulted in dirty snow clumps falling in her spot and the tires packing down the snow - which will apparently freeze and be harder to shovel and a safety issue for her. \n\nI’ve been polite so far but I told her that at a certain point I can’t control how people drive in a communal parking lot. I did kick the bigger clumps off her spot for her even though I don’t think it was my dads fault. I appreciate she has falling fears but my feeling is it’s Canada in the winter and it’s a communal parking lot. I don’t think it’s fair to continually make me feel guilty for anyone ever even touching her parking spots. She doesn’t even need the space but I swear she just sits and watches out the window all day to make sure no one touches it. \n\nI don’t want bad blood but I don’t know how to handle this anymore? Continue being polite? Take full responsibly for everyone else’s driving? Confirm the parking bylaws with my HOA? Or be petty? And if so how?? I’d love a laugh.",

        "text": "I was a new school psychologist in a new position. I was struggling to organize my office as I was the first psychologist in 5 years. One day the superintendent sends me a memo that he had to cut my secretary. I’d have to type my own reports. \nI sucked at typing and still do. So I took my Underwood typewriter (It was 1977) and went down to the teacher’s lounge. I began to type. I didn’t take calls or read my mail or agree to meetings. I typed. I cussed. I erased. I typed for about a week. People saw me grunting out the work hour after hour. \nSomehow the news that a staff member with more education than the superintendent was chained to a typewriter trying to get out time sensitive work got to the superintendent. \nHe got me an ex legal secretary who knew more about office procedures than I ever dreamed. She carried my butt through the years we worked there. \nI told him he had a real eye for talent and thanked him. It took me a while to get over the tar consistency coffee the teachers drank. I got a 13% raise the next year.",

However she developed a plan. \n\nAll year long she saved up old candy. Broken, half melted candy canes? Smooshed old Cadbury eggs? Saved. All augmented but the cheapest, lamest candy the store had to offer. You see where this is going. \n\nThe following Halloween she had two bowls. All those cute little kids got top quality candy dropped into their buckets. Teens who couldn't be bothered got a big handful from the \"other\" bowl. Since she was delivering, all they heard was the satisfying thump into their (usually cheap plastic) bags. Not until they got home would they realize some unknown person had provided them with tricks instead of treats!",

        "text": "So for some context, I just recently separated from the Army after 8 years of service. I was a 25U, (basically IT generalist/telecommunications specialist), but also spent most of my career in special operations so I also had combat experience and definitely think/act like an infantryman.\n\nWell after leaving the SOF community I opted for a regular boring unit in my home state so that I could finish my contract and just move back home. I was only in this unit for 16 months. During that short duration I was under the supervision of a SFC that I did not agree with whatsoever on basically anything. This gentleman was very much the \"I'm your boss, do what I say without question\" type of person, and I simply don't respond to that.\n\nFast forward to about 90 days before I finish my contract and leave honorably, this SFC comes back from their \"deployment\" to Korea (not a real deployment IMO), and treats me even worse because I did make a couple poor decisions and got myself facing a forced separation from the Army. Basically our interactions went from agree to disagree, to \"you're a terrible example for your soldiers and a shitty human\". All this because I smoked some weed BTW.\n\nAnyway, part of this person's job was to go up to our BDE S6 once a week or so and interact with the civilian Net Tech working there. Unbeknownst to SFC, that civilian is retiring and the contractor is actively looking for a replacement. So I applied... And got the job.\n\nNow im on my 2nd week working this position and have had this SFC come to MY office a few times already asking for things that are not within my scope of responsibility, but that apparently the last guy helped him with anyway. I simply cannot explain the satisfaction I felt the first time I was able to say \"Sorry SFC, that's not my job\". He was visibly angry and called my boss, (the owner of this contracting company), who also said \"that's not his job\".\n\nSo now at 27yrs old I make literally 3x what I did in the Army for basically the same job, and I get the satisfaction of essentially controlling the success of an individual I quite dislike. I would never intentionally sabotage anyone but id be lying if I said I didn't make his job a lot more inconvenient.",

I later learned she blabbed about my parents recent divorce to all our friends even though she knew i didn't tell anyone and while she was doing this she WAS STILL BEGGING FOR ME TO GET BACK TOGETHER WITH HER. I was so angry that i told her off and she DENIED EVERYTHING! Then two days later she apologies and suddenly remembered that she was a asshole. \n\nI blocked her on everything. When we returned back to highschool she was super angry and would be passive aggressive all the time this has been going on for over 6 months, i didn't even talk to her AT ALL cause i knew she would see as a opportunity to date me again. Straight up ust ignored her everytime she tried talking to me so she would get the hint. \n\nSince we had the same friends she would make up lies and tell everyone that i was talking about her and how they shouldn't talk to me. I got this crap from our friends all the time it got so annoying and i had enough. \n\nEveryday she talked about her job and how she loved it and how everyone was friendly. Whenever someone said they were gonna apply she would say how she \"couldn't see them doing it\" . Plus she bragged about how much money she earned. I was like\" IF THE JOB WAS THAT GOOOODDD... \" so i applied and got a interview. Two days later found out i got the job and was LIKE HELL YEH. I told our friends and they said we should tell her and i was like okay. So they told her i needed to tell her something and she said \" WHAT DOES SHE WANT?\" like she was annoyed shut up. This pissed me off of course and i told her i got a job where she works. HER FACE WAS PRICELESS SHE WAS ANGRY. \n\nAccording to my friend she cried and had to leave class because she was so emotional. She thought i was joking and faking it  accordinging to our friends so on my first shift i come in wearing the apron and she sees this and is mad. I just smile like the asshole i am. \n\nNext THE JUMPER \n\nSo we have a school camp and we were given a form and told we put down people we wanna be with. SO IT TURNS out that she wanted to kick me out from the friend group and it would just be them. I was upset so i brought her favourite childhood jumper she gave me to camp and wore it infront of her. She was angry ofc and stormed off. On the last day of camp we were taking down the campsite and i noticed her camp site was down below ( we were on a hill) , my friend started yelling hey to all of them. They noticed as and began talking. She saw me and gave me a death stare so i yelled as loudly as i could \"SUCK IT BITCH IM WEARING UR FAVOURITE CHILDHOOD JACKET\". Not sure if she heard but everyone around me was laughing.\n\nWe were on a field and headed out of school and my friend told me she saw alessia look at me and roll her eyes. So i thought i could do one better, so me and my friends were walking close to her and i mention very loudly while carrying her jacket \" yeah i hate this jacket its really crusty and gross i think im gonna cut it up and do some sowing\". She heard this and well ofc was angry. She literally raged walked her way to the bus. \n\nI wasn't kidding when i said i was gonna cut it up, im turning it into a bag and wearing it to work. I don't hate her anymore but yeah this was me at my pettiest.",

        "text": "I was bullied all through my school years. They went after my weight, clothes, ADHD, taste in music, complexion, eyebrows, etc. You name it, they bullied me over it.  One girl in particular, we'll call her Jane, held a grudge against me for YEARS because when we were in the girl scouts (elementary school), she claimed that my mom called her mom telling her Jane was bullying me. Jane denied bullying me, of course. First, yes, she was bullying me. Let's be honest here! Second, I had asked my mom repeatedly about this alleged phone call and she swears she never did. My mom is an amazing, supportive person and I'm obviously going to believe her over Jane. Third, even if this phone call had happened, it was years ago!\n\n\nFast forward to Junior year of high school. Jane and I are both in drama club, she's still hanging on to this alleged phone call, and we're stuck sharing a hotel room for a 3-day high school theatre festival. Whenever I'm around her, she's constantly nagging me. I tried to be kind and stay out of her way, but she essentially bit my head off every chance she had. It's the last night and I'm watching TV in my bed feeling angry and mentally exhausted. Theatre fest was something I looked forward to every year and she had ruined it for me over a phone call that NEVER HAPPENED. Jane comes out of the bathroom in her swimsuit and announces that she's going to the hotel pool.  Jane reaches for her room key, but stops and asks me if I'm staying in for the night. In that moment, inspiration struck and I heard angels singing! I smiled sweetly and said yes. With that, Jane left for the pool WITHOUT her room key. Knowing that she assumed I'd just let her back in later, I locked the door and went to sleep.\n\nApparently, Jane spent an hour or so pounding on the door and having kids call my room. I'm a sound sleeper so I didn't hear any of this *wink*. Keep in mind that our teacher was just down the hall and could easily help Jane get a new room key. Finally, Jane and our teacher got a new key and she was able to get back in.\n\nThe next morning, Jane growled at me for falling asleep and locking her out. I acted (theatre kid) mortified and told her and our teacher that I must've been more tired than I thought. I know Jane suspected I did it on purpose, but she couldn't do anything about it because there was no proof. After all, Jane was the one who chose to go to the pool without her room key.\n\nWhen I got home, I told my mom everything. She told me \"Any other person, I would've been upset with you, but she had that coming!\" We still laugh about it every now and then.\n\nJane never mentioned the alleged phone call again so…MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!",

Which is annoying but fine. They also started to take videos of them singing the songs. The actual annoying part is the concert hall is very dim so they started to open the flashlight from another phone to brighten the video. This meant that we were hit with an extremely bright flash during a very dim enviroment and it was annoying as f*ck. Lastly during breaks they were constantly asking for a specific song, which happens to be their most popular. \n\nCue the revenge. My gf had enough of this and told me that she will use her phone's flash to ruin their video and I said I'll gladly join with mine. \n\nPetty gods were on our side and right when we decided to move forward with our plan, the band started their \"song\". They were trying to get a good angle however, we were constantly adjusting our phone flashes to ruin their video. Its just their blurred, off color faces with two bright lights behind. We kept this throughout the whole song. They tried to change phones, angle, adjust the video but it was impossible to get a decent video with such strong backlight. The videos were deleted and believe me I've never felt this satisfied for a long time. \n\nThey were extremely annoyed but unable to say anything since we were much older so they decided to relocate to somewhere far far away and we were able to enjoy the rest of the concert in peace.",

        "text": "This happened while I (22m) was in college.  I lived in a house with several other guys, I'd been there the longest so I had the basement to myself, but I still used the upstairs to hang out in the living room and use the kitchen and bathroom.  We got a new younger male (19m) roommate who, unfortunately, couldn't pick up anything.  He chewed, so he would frequently spit into a soda can, creating a kind of nasty room odorizer.  He would also leave his dishes in the sink or in the living room, this was made worse by the fact that we didn't have a ton of dishes, so a few days of this behavior meant you had to do dishes to make dinner.   The offending roommate was asked over and over to keep up on his mess and dishes, but it seemed he grew up in a house where he was never expected to do ANYTHING.  So, this kept up for months, and to keep the peace the other roommates and I took care of most of the picking up and cleaning,  so nothing ever exploded.  \n\nCue petty revenge.  Said roommate came home from fishing and decided to gut his fish on the front stoop.  Then, as was his typical lazy behavior, left the house.  Guts, skin, blood, etc strewn all over the front steps.  I decided to clean up the mess myself, but this time I packaged the contents into a brown bag and put the slurry under the offending room-mates bed. \n\nDays passed, and I'd basically forgotten about the fish gut bag under the offending room-mates bed.  I came home to find the offending roommate, basically screaming while tearing everything he owned in his room, out of the room, and moving it out into the lawn, all the while bitching about how f\\*\\* nasty his room smells.  Turns out, he was maintaining a relationship and she'd come over from time to time, but the nasty smell in his room was near puke level and nothing had been done about it because, well the offending room-mate didn't clean his room either so it just got worse and worse until she refused to come over at all.  So, the room was emptied onto the lawn and, while I'm in the living room wondering how this will all go down, eventually he came out with part of a bag.  The contents had dissolved through the brown paper bag and found a place in the carpet to turn into something horrible.  He brought the partial bag into the living room and said something of the order like \"omg, who the f\\*\\*\\* would do this?\"  I put on my best, who the f\\*\\*\\* knows, and what are you talking about?   He stormed around the house pissed, the smell wasn't going to be easy to get out of the carpet, so the asshat had to clean...hahaha.    He moved out shortly after and I couldn't have been happier.",

Anyway, I worked two jobs there (they were linked in nature so a natural pairing) and one was “tech support” that included helping people who contacted me off the net (non-fellow employees).\n\nP = person requesting help\n\nMe = duh lol\n\nP writes and asks how to do something that the device is not designed to do.  I know this already but we have a work around that we’ve worked out.  So I give him the instructions.  I do note to him that it entails some things like flashing the ROM and inserting the file there and how to then enable it and that this involves a bit of risk but we’ve all done it and never had a negative outcome.  But that, of course, it’s up to him and his level of comfort.  I also offered to PM him if he wanted me to walk with him through it live.\n\nP writes back and chews me out from top to bottom.  Tells me how he got my contact link from (lets call them Lony – a big name in tech for many decades) Lony and how he can’t believe that they would tell him to do that.\n\nMe – Sir we are not linked with Lony in any way.  I gave you the instructions that we over at my site and others have used a great number of times.  It is of course up to you if you feel comfortable to do this.  Lony will not tell you how to do this because they don’t want you in their ROM, hence the reason it is protected from users.\n\nP writes back threatening to go back to Lony’s site and call them to get me fired for my instructions.  He swears he got to me from a link on there site and therefore I work for them.\n\nMe writes the webmaster/owner of where I work and asking if I was out of line.  Note - I’m a VERY timid person and did not want to cause trouble.\n\nThe webmaster writes to P and tells him how I was trying to help, we are not associated in anyway with Lony and he’s free to F-off from contacting me.\n\n**Here comes the fun part…**\n\nSo P tries my work-around and low and behold it works.  Gee?\n\nApparently P also found out I was a woman.  This is twenty years ago, so not so common, he assumed he was abusing a man so he didn’t have to be nice in the hopes of future nooky.\n\nP writes to apologize and ask me out to dinner.\n\nI write to P and agree.   \n\nP is happy.\n\nI write to P a day before the dinner and send him a truly horrible pic of my 3 kids and tell him “FYI, these are 3 of my 7 kids.  They will all be going with us to dinner as there father is in prison and I can’t afford a babysitter. See you tomorrow night!”\n\nNeedless to say I never heard from him again.",

Basically he said it sucks your carts broke but figure out another way to carry 25 lunches the 1/4 mile distance, because even though we’re not using it it’s ours. Cue my revenge plan.

        "text": "\n\nSo to start I am on mobile so sorry if there are any errors I don't catch. I also posted in r/prorevenge but they said it'd be better here. \n\n\n\nI (27f) was driving to work a couple weeks ago and got stuck at a red light. It was before 8 am and I was preparing myself mentally for my workload. The light just turned green and no less than .03 seconds after it turned green the truck behind me slammed on his horn like I wasn't paying attention and over 10 seconds had passed. \n\n\nI didn't really react I just drove up to the next light and continued on my commute. At the next light the truck that was behind me pulled up next to me in the left lane and the older man (probably in his early 70s) rolled his window down and started screaming profanities at me. \n\n\"FAT COW! FAT PIG! WH*RE! SL*T! I HOPE YOU GET R****!!!\" Just the worst things you could ever yell to a woman and it went on and on for every single light on my way to work. For 10 minutes this man threw the worst insults my way. \n\nWe finally got to the last light and the man was now behind me and I was just happy that I'd make a right and he'd go straight. Well that didn't happen. He also turned right. Right into the parking lot of the place I work. Now I work as a dog groomer but I don't keep my smock on me. It stays in the salon since we have a washer/drier setup I just wash my smock with the towels at work so I never forget it. I also bring my dogs with me to work on occasion so I can groom them on a table where it's easier. The point is I don't look like a salon employee as I am walking up to the doors. \n\n\nThe man got out of his car and unloaded two of the biggest german shepherds I've ever seen. This man is a client in my salon. The whole time we are walking up to the salon he's screaming more profanities my way. I'd been ignoring him on the road and I guess it made him angrier because the insults became threats about how he'd hurt me and let his dogs attack my dogs. Imagine his surprise when I walked not only through the front door but behind the counter. I gave a coworker my dogs to put in their kennels and checked the schedule. His dogs are my first two appointments. \n\n\nThe man is silent while I look on the computer. I then smiled at him and asked him to please leave the premises. He got very upset and said that he had the appointments booked a month in advance and that everyone in the area was booked out another month. I told him we don't take kindly to people threatening employees and he would not be getting his dogs haircuts (outline trims not shave downs) and to have a wonderful day. He demanded the manager because nothing he said while I was on the clock. My manager sided with me and he was banned from our location. \n\n\n\nTreat strangers with respect.",

        "text": "This story takes place across a decade. \n\nWhen I (f) was in 7th grade I got my first boyfriend- Roy. Roy was in 8th grade, popular, and cute so I was very happy to have him as my first boyfriend. We went to the middle school dance together. I had my first kiss with him there. I probably wasn’t very good at it. It wasn’t his first kiss but it was mine. He was a little bit more experienced than I was. \n\nWe were in the same school clubs which meant we got to go in the same end of school year field trip together. The field trip was about an hour away so it was a long bus ride. I sat with Roy in the back of the bus where we were kissing and he was pressuring me to do more than I was comfortable doing. He unzipped his pants, put my hands down his pants, and tried to unzip mine as well. I told him no and he would stop for a few minutes and then try again. I heard one of my best friends start to cry. She was sitting several rows in front of us. I was worried for her and wanted out of this uncomfortable situation so I jumped at the chance to move seats and go check on her. Roy said he understood and encouraged me to do so. \n\nI comforted my friend for 15-20 minutes. I made sure she was feeling better and then I was going to move back to sit with Roy. When I looked back at Roy’s seat he wasn’t alone. Hellen was sitting with him. I saw his euphoric expression on his face and I saw Hellen’s head bobbing up and down so I knew what was happening. Roy, the shithead, didn’t even care that I saw. Obviously I broke up with him and I didn’t speak to him again for several months. \n\nWe lived in a very small town (approximately 500 people) and like I said we were in the same school and clubs so I had to see him around. He apologized to me several times. I did not forget what happened but we got to where we could be in the same group with our mutual friends and I could stand to be around him again. We moved on with our lives and it was fine. I ended up moving away from that small town a year later when I was 13 years old. \n\nFlash forward 10 years. I am now 23 years old and I graduated from college. I’ve blossomed into a beautiful young woman with a good figure, whereas in 7th grade I was skinny as a rail with no curves, no figure, and had the awkward preteen look. I had clearly grown out of that.  I went to visit my best friend Tara in the same small town where we had grown up. When I was visiting Tara her cousin, KC, and his roommate came over to hang out. The roommate was Roy!\n\nRoy had not seen me since I was small and awkward looking. Now I was a size 2 and had DD boobs with long wavy hair. I was wearing jeans and a low cut shirt so I know I looked good. I feel like I used to be the ugly duckling back then and now I was a beautiful swan. The look on Roy’s face said the same thing. His eyes lit up and he said it was good to see me. \n\nLike I said I had moved on from what happened all those years ago on the school bus but I had not forgotten. Roy was flirting with me and it was clear that he was interested. I told him I still thought he was cute and I shamelessly flirted back. I would get close as if to kiss him and then I would move away. I would whisper flirtatious words into his ear letting my lips just brush him. It gave him goosebumps. I put my hand on his thigh so close to his rising mound but not touching it. \n\nThen I stood up and asked Tara if Roy and I could have some privacy in her bedroom. She said yes, although she looked at me confused as it to ask “why?” Tara had been on the bus with me all those years ago and knew what happened between me and Roy. Why would I give him a second chance? I gave her a knowing look shared between best friends and she knew. \n\nRoy’s face looked like Christmas had come early. I whispered to him to go into her room, strip down, and wait for me on the bed. I was going to run to the bathroom and then meet him there. I think he sprinted to Tara’s bedroom. I went to the bathroom, touched up my makeup, and waited enough time so I knew he would be naked waiting for me. \n\nI opened the bedroom door and Roy was in his birthday suite, rock hard, stroking himself, and waiting for me. I said some flirtatious things as I slowly walked closer to the bed. I told him to close his eyes while I undressed. Of course he didn’t want to. I told him I wouldn’t undress unless he closed his eyes so he complied (at least for a few seconds). When this happened I grabbed his pants, which had his wallet and car keys in them, and I ran from the room. I continued running outside. It was snowing. I took Roy’s keys and I threw them somewhere into the snow. I took his wallet and as I threw it in the opposite direction Roy came running through the living room naked in front of our friends screaming “what are you doing?” \n\nI told him “this is for 7th grade. This is payback for you thinking getting head on a bus from some slut was more important than our relationship. Maybe you’ll think twice about being a cheating man whore in the future!” Then I took his pants and threw them in the street. \n\nMy best friend Tara and her cousin KC were standing there watching us historically laughing. Both Tara and KC had been on the field trip that day a decade ago so they both knew how much it hurt me when he did that. Neither Tara nor KC helped Roy find his wallet or keys. While Roy was looking for his things, Tara and I locked her house and left Roy naked in the snow while we went out to eat dinner. \n\nIt was the best revenge I’ve ever gotten. \n\n\nP.S. KC was with Roy when we left him in the snow so we knew he wouldn’t be in any danger. KC had his own car keys and turned the heater on in the car for them. I knew he would be physically fine. I’m not that cruel.",

        "text": "Around 15 years ago, I went to our county fair. Usually, I just eat all the junk food. However, I saw game that used a cork gun where you shoot little wooden targets off of a rail and win whatever prize is strapped to the target. I was pretty excited to try it because my grandpa taught me how to hold and shoot a BB gun and anytime we visited, I would just shoot his BB gun all day because they didn't have a TV or games or anything, so that was the only fun thing to kill time.\n\nIn the game, you got unlimited shots for $2 until you knock down a target. I paid for one game, shot down a plastic kazoo, and as I was about to turn leave, I noticed a target with a $50 bill on it. I asked the worker if that was a real bill and he said it was! \n\nDuring my first game, I noticed the sight on the gun was off by one target to the right, so if I aimed for a target, it would shoot the one just to the right of it.\n\nDuring my second go at it, I just aimed at the target to the left and hit the $50 bill squarely in the center. Clearly, the target was weighted because it rocked back a tiny bit but didn't drop. So, I kept reloading and aiming just to the left of the bill. I was a fairly good shot and didn't miss a shot the whole time I was playing the game.\n\nAfter a few shots, I noticed it was slowly inching back and I was starting to get excited. Another 15-20 shots later, the carnival worker was putting another target back that someone else shot down, reached up, and moved my target back to the front of the rail. I am non-confrontational by nature, but I was fucking pissed cuz it took a while to get it close to dropping, so I just kept shooting at it knowing it was a virtual guarantee that it'd drop eventually. \n\nAfter another round of 15-20 shots, I hit it and it teetered back quite a bit, but it came back forward and didn't fall. As I was reloading, the worker speedwalked over and again, moved it back to the front and smirked at me when he was walking back to the side. To say I was fucking pissed would be a gross understatement. I stood there for a very brief second staring at him, wondering if I should say something, keep shooting, shoot HIM, or just give up. \n\nNormally, I would just walk away from whatever is making me angry or upset, but I must have had some pent up anger at the time because I grabbed the cork gun by the butt, swung it at the table, and broke the barrel off. I took what was left of the gun and threw it at the targets and knocked a bunch of em off the rail and just walked away. I could hear the guy yelling shit like get the fuck outta there, he's gonna call the cops, sue me, blah blah blah, but I just kept walking. \n\nI hope that gun was worth more than $50, dickfuck.",

I continued to say I wouldn't be voting for her, her chosen family was shit and if she was so concerned about kids and family she should start at home. She was terrified and actually said \"I have no idea what to say right now\" as she uncomfortably backed off my porch. I hope she put me on a \"do not visit\" list.",

        "text": "Hey, you\n\nSome toxic redditor started downvoting you and acting rude towards you for no good reason? like just when you were answering a question honestly or when you were voicing your opinion honestly and they simply decided to hate on you, the person, for your opinion?\n\nNo problem. Here is what you'll do:\n\n1- Don't reply back. 95% of the time they're more likely to just keep agitating you and downvoting your replies regardless of what you say or even if you're trying to remedy the situation. Most of them are dum dums who just wanna piss you off so save your time and don't reply back UNLESS there is a potential to bait them into something report worthy.\n\n2- If they happened to harass, insult, bully you, report them. Let reddit give them that sweet sweet warning and tell them the sweet message of that if they continue, they might get banned. \n\n3- The most important and main thing is this step: without saying a word or replying with anything, enter their profile and start downvoting their comments that have negative, 0, 1, 2 upvotes so that you can make a big number of their comments negative value, 0 or 1. Let's be real, many redditors like to check their profile to see how their comments have been. This trick uses that against those toxic sort of redditors who bully others. They'll look at their profile and feel they were hated and unappreciated in their past couple of posts and they might start hating on the wrong people even because, they won't even know what hit them. Odds are they won't realize it was you and even if they do, they can't report or harm you in anyway aside from downvotes, dms or comments which you can also use against them to report them again. \n\n**Tl;dr** if someone on Reddit was being toxic to you for no good reason, just visit their profile silently and downvote their posts that have either negative, 0 , 1 votes and have solace in the fact that most of them will squirm the next time they see their profile and will be like a headless chicken not even realizing who did it or why they were downvoted. \n\nHave fun! :D",

Of course no one do that to fat people then your disgusting if you do that. \n\nthe thing was one friend was around 60kg and the other one was just 2/3 kg more than me the comment from 60kg started getting so much that I was sick of it the 60kg one is fair pretty features and all that so she made comments about literally everyone no matter skinny fat or whatever \n\n\nSomething I noticed is she never like here \"you too\" Whenever she comented on someone that they are fat she'll be like not more that you thought or why do you care. One thing more is she have Body Hair nothing unusual about it but that was something she was insecure about and I had very less body hair so all the time she mentioned about my weight or teeth I made a comment about her weight and body hair ofcourse her comments didn't stop she used to ignore me by an eye roll start another conversation \nBut since I was making it so many times after 1 week she stopped looked death in my eye pissed asking \"why do I care about her body care\" I replied then why do you care about my weight or teeth she said \"yeeehh\" \nThen switch back to another conversation. Later she apologized for it but the coments still come here and there but not that much like it used too. The funniest shit was seeing her frustrating look not knowing she made so many people feel like that seeing it worked a lot of classmates started doing it too whenever she mentioned anything about their appearance they'll do the same every single time so that's what made her behavior stop with them but since I was her \"best friend\" I did hear it here and there",

It’s almost pitch black on this hill, and it’s crawling with deer. That may even be an understatement. \nAnyways, I was going a little under the speed limit since they were everywhere and constantly walking into the road. As I’m driving, an old pickup truck comes up and rides my ass while flashing his high beams. I speed up, and so does he, still flashing his lights.\nI held my speed because I didn’t want to risk hitting one since my car is so small. He then passes me while laying on his horn and flipping me off. He floors it down the road at like 90 and disappears. I get being frustrated I was going sort of slow, but he could SEE THE DEER. They were running around everywhere. \nMaybe like a minute down the road, I see headlights in a ditch. Low and behold this dude’s bumper is obliterated. He’s okay though, just standing and observing his damage with his hands on his head. As I drive by, honk and wave. \nHappy Halloween you kin fucking hillbilly.",

My friend (his wife) took out a cc in his name, but without him knowing. Maxed it. Never made payments.

Onto the story.\n\n-\n\nSo, all of us agreed on quiet hours for laundry because the laundry room is right next to P + I's bedroom, and it's extremely difficult to sleep when the laundry is going. However, E has been continuously doing laundry outside of quiet hours, leading to me being unable to sleep at a decent time for days on end. I sent a message into the group chat, simply reminding everyone of our agreed upon quiet time. E blew up at me - calling me delusional, insisting he never agreed to quiet hours, etc. \n\nThis got me very upset, so I decided to take a nice long hot shower. I was in there quite awhile, since I was very upset. Eventually I had to end my shower, because I ran out of hot water. It's too bad that I ran out of hot water right before E usually takes his shower! And I think I'm going to continue taking my hot showers at this time, I've discovered that they really help with my insomnia.\n\nBest part of this is that we have a good enough hot water system that all four of us could take a hot shower back to back. E would have had more than enough hot water if his laundry wasn't going. Sorry E!",

I figured no damage had been done they just had to spend time in the rain getting wet and removing the paper to be able to leave. As they were cleaning it off I walked by them to get my truck.

He sends a message saying it's too far so I said \"okay, cancel the ride please\" and he doesn't reply. He starts driving around the parking lot of the airport a bit so I thought he was going to pick me up but I notice him driving around in a loop. He wants me to cancel it and I start feeling petty.\n\nI don't mind when drivers cancel because it's too far or the ride isn't worth it, I get it. Uber is a crappy company and pays their drivers crap so you want to make your rides worth it, but you still work for them so either cancel the ride or pick me up.\n\nIt's getting closer to my time to work so I open Lyft to get a ride, I go to work and keep checking my phone. The driver is either driving around the airport or just sitting there. I get distracted by work and when I check my phone 40 minutes later, it says the driver is 10 minutes away from me so I cancel the ride.\n\nLike I said I understand you want to maximize your rides but at least cancel them if you don't want to do it. The guy wasted an hour and a half with me when he could have cancelled and given more rides. Or he could have just picked me up.",

Overtime was the first casualty, and morale was suffering. People started dragging their 15 minute breaks to 20 minutes, not including the walk from the floor to the breakroom. Well, one of the finance team figured we were costing the company money, and it needed to stop.\n\nThus, your break was scheduled, and was clock time not “time spent in the breakroom.” Customer stops you to ask you a question? Too bad. Forget? Too bad.  As I am sure you can imagine, this was a HUGE hit with the staff. The Sports Team especially had to walk through the whole store to get to the break-room, and try to do that without getting stopped for help. \n\nSo, something had to be done. (Important facts: The patio sets came in boxes that were 6 foot long, 4 foot high, and 3 foot wide. The conveyor room was accessed buy a cut out wall section, think a 20 foot x 10 foot rectangle cutout in the wall) We came in early on a Saturday to stage some of the boxes of Lawn Furniture in the alcove at the back of the sports department. My buddy and I were stacking them and he said “ I wish I had these to build a fort when I was a kid. “ I instantly saw the opportunity, and we stacked the boxes to make a hidden room in the alcove. You had to push a box and crawl in, but we had a hidden room / box fort right on the store floor! \n\nWe added a power cord from electrical, a fridge from appliances, and food and drinks we snuck in on weekends. We all started taking our breaks there, and even kept a wireless phone to use to page each other so people that were looking for us would be following pages like “ Frank to the camping section please?”\n\nIt lasted about 5 days before the Sports Manager caught us. We thought we were screwed, and he was mad, but also understood why we did it. We didn’t get written up!",

Each year we did a large project to build a new production plan, identify areas where we could reduce some of our twenty five million in inventory and find ways to increase our percent of fill. \n\nFearing who would take his place I was in the unenviable position of needing to help him be successful, at least to an extent. So after completing the plan he was to send it to our division manager for review and approval. I attached an excel spreadsheet with both the summary and detail into an email and sent it to him. \n\nI walked into his office and told him it was in his inbox, and that he needed to save it to his HD and then email it to our Division Manager. He waved me off, telling me he knew what he was doing. Then being a less than savvy tech person, just forwarded it on with my explanation but his email taking credit for doing it himself. \n\nAbout an hour later I got a direct call from the division manager, laughing about my boss taking credit for my work. SMH I learned really early that giving credit to those I work with rather than trying to steal it was a far better policy.",

So I took a job in the office of a department that provided complicated food services 24/7. Anyway, my supervisor, P, quickly showed herself to be a real bitch - she micromanaged, she was verbally abusive, she lied, etc. On my first day,  she made a point of lying about me to my coworker, D, and vice versa; this caused friction until D and I really talked and figured out P's lies. She frequently was very disrespectful to others, being loud and critical in front of others. \n\nShe tried to micromanage anyone she could. She didn't try this with me often. But she would try sometimes - I think she hated me because it was obvious I was much more skilled and experienced. She was meaner, but I was smarter. I generally quickly shut down her attempts with me. \n\nAnyway, one of my daily tasks was to take the previous day's income to HQ at 8:30 am. Our buildings were within a 5-minute walk, and Florida weather made the trip a real perk. Well P overheard me say how I enjoyed the walk, so suddenly determined walking was dangerous and I'd have to use the golf cart. (Our 500-acre campus was fully gated, heavily secured with restricted visitors. We carried maybe $75 cash in a locked bank bag.) The entire task took 20 mins total, 25 if I chatted with the HQ worker. P would have to handle calls and visitors during that period.\n\nSo I took the golf cart (10 mph tops). I took the scenic route around campus to and from HQ. I found vacant buildings, a park, a boat, etc that most employees were unaware of. I enjoyed the gorgeous, early am sunshine. A 15-minute errand using the cart now took 35-45 minutes instead.\n\nAfter a few days, she queried why it was taking longer. I explained I was taking the opportunity to really learn the campus layout (my prepared CYA excuse). P had no response. See, I made sure to say this in front of our director, who I had discovered would shut her down at any possible opportunity. (Probably his petty revenge for other crap she did.) \n\nSo for the rest of my year in hell working with her, I enjoyed sunshine while she answered phones.",
