Well for me it the twist in Shut up and dance (season 3 episode 3) were after sympthasing with kenny all the way though he's reavled to be a pedophile. I went wide eyed and stared into the screen past the credits to meet me reflection in the black mirror. I was so distrubed that even for one second I sympathised with him, when the clues were right there(the kid at the start, the drawing, extra shiftyness when watching the stuff, the pedo in the forrest), and through the episode I was like \"really? Just wanking isn't that bad?\" only to get blindsided at the end. \n\nso what was your favourite twist?",

[If you were to look at the album cover,](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719SroNweJL._SL1500_.jpg) Lana's appearance is similar to Yorkie's. [The long sleeved, collared shirt, short red hair, and pale skin](https://www.buro247.kz/thumb/640x960_8/images/Black-Mirror-season-3-trailer-1.jpg) are all strikingly similar to the album cover, though Lana doesn't have glasses, of course. As well, looking at the lyrics of the track \"Video Games\" easily the biggest single off of Lana's album, you would see the line \"heaven is a place on earth with you.\" Hmmm... sounds familiar, huh? As well, [according to the Genius page itself at least,](https://genius.com/568786) this was an intentional nod to Belinda Carlisle's song. This certainly could have just been a fun coincidence, but hey, maybe Charlie Brooker and the other writers were listing to some angsty pop music. Who knows? Just some speculation on my part.",

        "text": "One of the biggest debates I see between fans of Black Mirror is the debate on 'is it wrong to subject the cookies to abuse?' Some people say that since cookies are literally copies of a living human's consciousness, and they obviously 'feel' things and are 'alive' in a way to an extent, that torturing them as some characters do is wrong and they deserve the comeuppance that they get. \n\nOthers then say that since cookies aren't real humans, only copies of real humans, that the characters who mistreat them in episodes should be forgiven, and they take the stance that they didn't really do anything wrong at all. \n\nThe two contrasting viewpoints made me think about how this debate would go, if something like the cookies became a thing irl. I imagine it'd be a polarising topic similar to how it's polarising in Black Mirror, only it would be a much bigger issue, obviously. So what do ye think? Like I said I'm sure there'd be people on either side, but would it generally be seen as inhumane to subject them to torturous circumstances, or would we look past it?",

She asks what he said and he repeats himself a bit clearer but it still cuts out again.\n\nDoes anyone know what exactly he said? I feel like it has to be important to the episode for the writers to add it in and then muffle the sound. I was thinking the whole episode she would do whatever it was Ash told her not to do (I thought it would be something along the lines of don’t confuse the Android) but oddly nothing seemed to come of it.\n\nThanks in advance for any answers you may have.",

But let’s put that to side and put our place in hers. So let’s say you already put the man in the lake, and murdered the other man, and you are now at your house (Mia’s house) being scanned through the memory scanner thing and the investigator finds out what you have done. What would you do? I would love to hear your responses. \n\nThe “Morally correct” answer would be to say that you would admit you are guilty, but you gotta realize she has a family, and I’m almost positive that would be a life sentence.

        "text": "Seen a few disturbing posts related mainly to USS Callister insisting that what Daly did wasn't so bad because the digital clones were \"just code\" so what is done to them didn't really matter or \"count\" as if it were done to real people.  \n\nThis is an extremely morally problematic view of things.  First, a DNA replication/RNA transcription chapter in Biology class will make it clear that any of us human beings are \"just code.\"  But more importantly, treatment of any being cannot be based simply on our perception of what \"kind\" of thing it is.  Empathy is an instinctive response to the perception of an emotional experience in another being.  People have empathy toward animals because we can perceive and actually relate to what we see to be their fear, physical pain, hunger, etc. It doesn't matter that they are different kinds of beings from us.\n\n\nThe moment we begin defending a lack of empathy based on the kind of thing we think someone or something is, then we're basically in the world of Men Against Fire, insisting that it doesn't matter if we dehumanize (or de-personalize) certain people because they aren't the \"right kind\" of humans to deserve an empathetic response.  \n\n\nDaly was evil because he actually enjoyed causing the digital clones to suffer, knowing that that suffering was wholly felt by them.  He couldn't gain the respect of individuals with independent will and emotion in his normal life, so he created another universe in which he could control externals but still had no control over the will and emotion of the digital clones.  He had no more ability to gain their respect in the Infinity universe than in his normal life, so he used various physical punishments, humiliations, and emotional blackmail to coerce them into submission, which was based purely on fear.  But they always retained their own will and independent emotional response.  Daly just created a universe in which he wouldn't experience the negative consequences of his actions, as he would in his normal life.  \n\n\nBy contrast pop Mario Bros. into your classic Nintendo, and the Mario and Luigi avatars are mere representations of the choices you, the player makes.  They only move when you indicate to move.  Even with advanced games, the same is true, just on a more sophisticated level.  Characters/events not initiated by players are nevertheless dictated by the game developer.  This is *not* the case with digital clones/cookies.  Their will and emotional response is always independent and based on their own personality, life experiences, and values, just like with human persons.  \n\nThe fact of the matter is that cookies/digital clones have, one, independent will, and two, the full range of human psychological and emotional responses that are triggered by outside forces, but *not* determined by them.  This means that cookies/digital clones are not simply representations of a techie's thought process.  The assertion of their will and emotional response is just as valid as that of a natural human being.  \n\nI think one very interesting theme throughout Black Mirror is exactly this--how easily we decide that certain people aren't sufficiently like us to deserve our empathy, despite clearly being able to think, feel, act, hope, etc. as we do.\n\nThe only non-human-but humanish character in Black Mirror thus far that I believe was not really a person was posthumous Ash, whose digital footprint was downloaded into some type of highly-realistic android.  Like a video game avatar, the Ash-droid, was only simulating what had been downloaded from past conversations.  He had no independent will nor emotion, but simply displayed what he was \"supposed to.\"  He didn't really care about being made to stand outside all night, confronting death, or being stuffed in an attic for years on end.  He had no sexual response because that data hadn't been provided to him.  He just displayed the patterns of behavior that he had been provided.  \n\n",

        "text": "My initial problem with half of the episodes of Season 4 in Black Mirror is (or, should I say, *was*) simple: happy endings. Black Museum, Hang the DJ and USS Callister - all three have happy endings... or so I thought. \n\nSee, I'm not a fan of happy endings in my Black Mirror. I love the feeling of a pain in my stomach, an inability to breathe and ten minutes of internal reflection following my episode. This is why Shut Up and Dance is my absolute favourite episode and San Junipero is my least (Yeah, I said it. I think San Junipero is the worst episode. C'mon, then, hit me.).\n\nBut I realised something - those three episodes I mentioned earlier had a sort of Nosedive-esque ending (where things initially seem like a good ending but, upon further reflection, are actually darker and sadder than presented).\n\nUSS Callister ends with a man literally being killed for torturing code that cannot truly feel anything. A genius, a prodigy and a social outcast murdered by a bunch of ones and zeros. \n\nBlack Museum ends with a man literally being killed for torturing code that cannot truly feel anyth-... wait... hang on...? Also, given the nature of the replicas of the screaming criminal, the death of the original hologram of the criminal doesn't do much when there are literally tens of thousands of copies of him, all in eternal pain forever.\n\nHang the DJ ends with... uh... okay... *that* is a truly happy ending, sure. Does that make it a bad episode? Not necessarily. Many people like San Junipero because they think it's well-written and brilliantly executed, despite its lack of a dark ending. While I personally disagree, I *do* see that in Hang the DJ. \n\nSo, hey, I've got no problem with Season 4 - unlike a few people on here. ",

I get asked all the time what certain colors look like to me. I think it would be really cool to have a grain just to show someone my day and be like, \"hey look! That's my version of purple. Told you it's blue to me.\" Then I was thinking about the use by doctors to see how bad their patient's vision is, if they have an onset of disease, etc. This might have been discussed before but I didn't find anything on it. What are your opinions?\n\nEdit: spelling ",

I finished the episode actually wishing that type of technology existed in our lifetime so that I could \"crossover\" to San Junipero. I don't know why I feel this way, I mean I guess I can a little bit, but this is a question for the redditors here. Would you crossover to San Junipero, or anytime and place in your youth really, if the technology were available in our lifetime? Or would you go the way of Kelly's husband and choose not to?

It’s about a theme park with anamatronics like in Disney World for example. But they get crazy lifelike, and now theyre starting to develop feelings and memories. I only watched a few eps but im pretty sure theyll take over the park at some point. I’d recommend it to everyone who enjoys black mirror! Now you’ll have something to watch while we’re waiting for s5 🙃",

I imagine it'd  be bigger in reality. \n\nHang the DJ tries to be advanced Tinder. Instead of romantic matching it's really about sexual chemistry.\n\nIt is implied in more futuristic eisodes children may be grown. The Roaches are likely having unprotected sex and breeding uncontrollably for regard of optimal offspring. History of You is the outlier here.\n\nAnd lastly, the show does heavily push on sex.
