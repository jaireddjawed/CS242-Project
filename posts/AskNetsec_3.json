        "text": "I’m looking for a new privacy-focused cloud storage service that deploys zero knowledge end-to-end encryption. I must say that I’m having a hard time understanding the terms and technology behind cloud and encryption stuff, though I’m still curious and would like to learn more. While reading about the pros and cons of encrypted cloud services, a question came up to my mind regarding the effectiveness and purpose of encrypting files:\n\nI use Windows 10 as my main OS; I store all my data locally on the PC, as well as having an automatically synced (identical) copy in cloud. Now let’s say that I open a document locally, edit it, save, then upload (sync) to an encrypted cloud service (alternatively, encrypt via Cryptomator and upload to whichever cloud service). I understand that the file that I just worked on and uploaded to the cloud service is now “safe” provided that the cloud provider uses zero knowledge E2EE. However, I viewed and edited the file in Windows 10 in an unencrypted state. Does this mean that Windows / Microsoft did have full access to the file and can send or sell data and information about the content of the file regardless of the encryption that happened afterwards? If that’s the case, then how can I benefit from encrypted cloud storage / encryption software (like Cryptomator) if the operating system is going to have full access to the local \\*unencrypted\\* files anyway? Especially when my Microsoft account is associated with both my Windows copy and MS Office apps – honestly it is just literally thoroughly integrated in the OS.\n\nPlease correct me where you see fit as I hate to be paranoid, but at this moment I can’t seem to understand how to safely store / sync files both locally &amp; in the cloud.

I'm hoping developing these skills will help me land a job with a focus in those general areas. With that in mind, would a Type I or Type II hypervisor provide me the most flexible, secure, and easiest set up? I would imagine a Type I would be easier to set up, but a Type II would be more secure and provide more flexible options. Would having access to a non-virtualized OS provide me any additional benefits in the malware analysis/reverse engineering process? I'd also welcome any general recommendations or security best practices for creating a sandbox to play with malware. Thanks!",

        "text": "Hello, I was wondering if you could evaluate a scenario for me.\n\nBackground:\nFully updated iphone with no jail break or whatever modifications. Has not yet been set up yet so when you turn it on the welcome message appears and asks you to create an iCloud account and a username etc. there is no passcode or anything because the phone is not even set up yet. left unattended for 5-10 minutes. \n\nHypothetical scenario: a bad actor comes in during those 5-10 minutes, takes the phone somewhere, inserts it into some machine and the machine uploads some kind of virus or malware or key logger into it that controls the device. Allows user to remote into it or see what’s going on like a MDM device or something, idk. Ambient listening and stuff.\n\nQuestions: is this scenario likely? Why or why not? I know certain software exists that brute forces into passcodes that the fbi or whatever has, and maybe even downloads data. I guess from there with access to an unlocked device they could install some type of spyware or something. But a. That would be a very sophisticated actor b. That iPhone has been set up and has data on it in my scenario it is a iPhone that is still in welcome mode so can someone install virus / malware / whatever into that?\n\nSo overall, Is this scenario possible or likely? And if so, would a simple factory reset clear things up? Thank you!!!",

        "text": "Hi there. \n\nI worked closely only with Splunk SIEM, as an engineer and as a SOC analyst and as a threat hunter and I loved this software. My personal criteria in choosing SIEM products may be strange, but I'm mainly interested in whether I can build complex searches and dashboards for my security investigations. I'm also learning ELK now, which is more difficult for me after Splunk, but I think the potential is the same, although I find it diffucult that there are 3 different languages for data search. Splunk used a syntax similar to bash scripts in Linux, and ELK has its jason queries, which is not very convenient for me yet, because I have to write more code, but I like this product. \n\nI've had experience with McAfee SIEM and AlienVault, and those products had a lot of tools already built in out of the box, but I couldn't build any flexible search engines and dashboards. These products were inconvenient for me to work with data. I worked with McAfee last time in 2019 and I am sure that a lot has changed. \n\nLet's bak on track, while searching for SIEM  I realized that they all have about the same functionality. Somewhere the interface is different, somewhere it is more convenient, somewhere less, but it is a matter of habit. I also like SIEMs built on ELK (Security Onion, Wazuh, etc.). Alos, a  lot of SIEM have out-of-box rules (correlation rules) and they close similiar between different SIEMs. \n\nMy personal criteria from security analyst prospective is only how convenient it will be for me to work with data in SIEM and build my own rules/flixeble dashboards with some automation stuff. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, I'm also interested in integration with our other security products, but almost all SIEMs already have parsers/addons/plugins built in with needed products.\n\nSo, what were your criteria for choosing a SIEM? I'm afraid of missing something important, of not taking something into account. I think one of the biggest concerns is whether it will be scalable. I read once in the comments on reddit that Security Onion had problems with scaling, but our company is small.",

        "text": " \n\nThis post will discuss IPS and the benefits it provides to organisations when configured and implemented correctly. The bad news is that many organisations are not utilising their IPS effectively. In many cases, they have just enabled the IPS on their edge firewalls, thinking that they are now protected against known attacks. \n\nWhat is an IPS? \n\nAn intrusion prevention system (IPS) - sometimes referred to as an intrusion detection prevention system (IDPS) - is a network security technology and an integral part of any enterprise security system that continuously monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and takes steps to prevent it. By reducing manual work for security teams and allowing other security products to perform more efficiently, IPS solutions help filter out malicious activity before it reaches other security devices and controls.\n\nThe wrong way to deploy it\n\nThe majority of protocols and traffic on the internet are encrypted today, as you are all aware. A good example of this is that you will rarely find any web servers running on HTTP protocol (unencrypted) on the internet. How does it relate to IPS? \n\nWithin all the environments I have worked with, I have seen an IPS configured on the edge firewall to protect web servers in the DMZ zone from attacks. However, the IPS does not do anything because it cannot inspect the inside of encrypted traffic (HTTPS) for malicious payloads or intrusions. \n\nThis is why you must perform testing after deploying any security measures in your environment. They would have known that the IPS wasn't doing anything if they had performed any vulnerability assessments and penetration tests. \n\nHow to deploy IPS the right way\n\nIn order to deploy the IPS correctly, you must ensure that it inspects unencrypted traffic. Inbound SSL Deep Inspection can be performed on the firewall for the relevant web server in your DMZ to achieve this. \n\nWhen you have multiple web servers in the DMZ, this approach can be resource-intensive on your firewall. A firewall's SSL Deep Inspection feature consumes a lot of resources. Therefore, SSL inspection should not be performed on inbound traffic via the firewall at the edge of the network. \n\nIn order to deploy IPS for web servers in your DMZ environment, it is best to use a load balancer or web application firewall to perform SSL offloading. Then, a firewall devoted solely to IPS should be placed after the web application firewall or load balancer. \n\nIf you desire end-to-end encryption between the client and the server, you will not be able to use the IPS. Overall, it is important to ensure that you are using all the features of your firewall. There is no point in paying thousands of dollars on a subscription only to not use all the features available to you.\n\nFeel free to leave a comment with your thoughts.",

        "text": "Hi /r/AskNetsec, I'm interested in becoming a threat hunter but I don't know where to begin and I could use some mentoring. I'm actively looking for a cybersecurity mentor to help me on my journey.\n\nA little about me: I have 5 years of experience as a Security Engineer. I specialize in identity and access management and cloud security. My organization is 100% cloud-based and we use the Microsoft security stack to manage our systems and technologies. I have experience in digital forensics, cryptography, network security, and compliance. I also have a master's degree in cybersecurity. \n\nHere are the key technical skills I've defined to being an effective threat hunter. I'm rating my understanding from 1-5, with 1 being no knowledge, 3 being average, to 5 being an expert, and they are in no certain order of importance:\n\n* PowerShell and Graph API (2)\n* Endpoint forensics (2)\n* Network forensics (3)\n* Windows (3) and Linux administration (2)\n* Microsoft Sentinel (2) and KQL (2)\n* Python (2)\n* Threat intelligence report reading (3)\n\nHere is where I request guidance:\n\n* **Choice paralysis.** I don't know where to begin. [Aaron Turner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvoK0oHXrMs&amp;list=WL&amp;index=2) strongly suggestions PowerShell and Graph API, but I'm unsure why this is a priority for me when I'll be working in a SIEM. I try to read threat reports daily, so I'm good there.\n* **Priority.** Let's say I feel comfortable with PowerShell after several months of practice. What's next, and after that?\n* **Official training.** [Black Hills Information Security](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/training-adventures/) and [eLearnSecurity](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ecthpv2-certification/) offer courses here, but I'm not sure if they're worth the time/money. I would love to go down the SANS route, but that is out of my price range. I'm considering Microsoft's SOC Analyst certification ([SC-200](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/sc-200)), but worried it doesn't go deep enough. I'd really like to have a roadmap to follow, and it would be nice to have accreditation, but this isn't essential. eLearnSecurity seems to be the closest thing I'm looking for.\n* **Readings and other sources.** I prefer reading text books to online reading. For example, I have [Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Windows-PowerShell-Month-Lunches/dp/1617291080), the [Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-Linux-System-Administration-Handbook/dp/0134277554), and [Network Forensics: Tracking Hackers through Cyberspace](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132564718/), but would like to be pointed to other key texts to aid in my development. I've subscribed to various podcasts on Google Podcasts and Feedly for threat intelligence updates.\n\nAny guidance would be extremely helpful. I'm happy to answer any questions and address any comments to refine my roadmap. Thanks!",

I'll go through the steps I took: \n\nI first set my Wi-Fi interface to monitor mode, then I changed the channel to 36 (5.18 GHz) as I have split 2.4 and 5GHz bands, but most devices, at least the ones I wish to monitor, are on the 5 GHz band. After that I disconnected and reconnected my phone to capture the 4 step handshake, which went well, and all 4 packets showed up. I used the [Wireshark WPA PSK generator](https://www.wireshark.org/tools/wpa-psk.html) to generate a key from my SSID and password, which I entered into the 802.11 protocol decryption settings. I exited and nothing, everything was still encrypted, the exact same as before. I double checked and my handshake was still there. As mentioned I am using WPA3, so maybe that has something to do with the issue?\n\nI am very confused here, so any guidance would be appreciated, thank you.\n\nEdit: I have changed my security to WPA2, and I can now see broadcasts like MDNS ARP, and occasionally I’ll get TCP from my target machine, so maybe it’s a problem receiving the packets and not a problem with my software.",

        "text": "I was thinking about login credentials and am wondering why linked emails aren't offered as a solution.  \nSo when you sign up to websites, usually it is in the form of email, password. I am lazy so I just use google to generate and store passwords for me. But what if the email used to create the account was unique for every website u signed up for and linked back to the main email you used?\n\nLets say my email is [abc@gmail.com](mailto:abc@gmail.com), when I sign up to website A, google generates me a linking email: [gd7awg28adh8@gmail.com](mailto:gd7awg28adh8@gmail.com) which links back to [abc@gmail.com](mailto:abc@gmail.com) and forwards all the messages to my main account. And when I sign up to website B, it links another email [hwdahiusdifagwg78@gmail.com](mailto:hwdahiusdifagwg78@gmail.com).\n\nThis would be beneficial in a few ways, 1. Maybe it would be harder to compromise accounts when hackers wouldn't even know what email they are trying to hack into? 2. If you dont have confidence in a website, they will never have your actual email. 3. If a website leaks your email or sells it w.e, maybe there's a feature that can stop forwarding the emails to your main account so that you dont receive spam/ dangerous emails?\n\nJust wanted to hear thoughts / flaws on this idea.\n\nNote: I asked this on r/cybersecurity but it was autoblocked by a bot for being a personal question. I feel like this post may also relate to this subreddit?",

        "text": "Let's say there's an organization where 100% of the workforce is remote, and it's a non-profit so the management team has decided to effectively require a BYOD environment for desktop/laptops as well as mobile devices to cut costs. There is no IT department so this decision was made by people who are more budget managers than boots on the ground technicians.\n\nThey're not on a domain network of any kind and are loosely collected around a cloud-based office collaboration platform for doc and file storage so it seems okay for everyone at the moment to just login from their home computers and do their days work and then clock out. Email is also handled through this cloud provider and MFA is enabled on all accounts (yay!). They also use an org password manager so another +1 for safe practices.\n\nHowever, let's also say that this org expects a higher than usual risk for cyber attacks due to the nature of its work, and that the threat actors are very well resourced. \n\nI'm consulting with such a group and am wondering a few things:\n\n- Do I need to have a serious conversation with the management team about switching from BYOD to a company owned machines? I have no idea how a collection of personal laptops will stand any sort of chance to a sophisticated cyberattack with just a basic antivirus installed. There's no way to check what apps are installed, to manage/monitor web traffic, ensure that the OS is getting updated when necessary, etc., etc., etc.\n\n- Do the employees of this org have any personal legal liability for the company data that may be present on their work computers? Like, if an employee does work on their family laptop and the company gets sued, can that laptop be subpoenaed and the individual face legal consequences for whatever issue the court case is addressing?\n\n- At what point does centralized \"antivirus for business\" software start risking an imposition on the personal privacy of the individual employee? IMO, any machine that is doing work for the org as somebody's primary work computer should have a robust EDR program examining everything in realtime and reporting on installed software, but that is also not okay to put on somebody's personal computer.\n\nI'm not a full-blown cyber security expert, but Ive worked in IT and sysadmin long enough to know that while this kind of situation might seem convenient and affordable in the short term, their org is one attack away from everyone being really fucking unhappy. I am tempted to tell them that they need to buy everyone a computer ASAP, even if its a shitty old $300 Dell OptiPlex refurb.\n\nAny advice y'all can provide would be much appreciated.",

If you do OSINT on the company your trying to hack say in this example it's a web application with a heavily fortified pass reset token algorithm using a CSPRNG that feeds in data from dev/urandom. Now say you find out there using a Dell optiplex server rack and you know the typical CPU and Mobo setup even down to the exact ram sticks. Couldn't the attacker replicate the same environmental noise by setting up an environment as close as possible to the targets server environment and run dev/urandom getting a bunch of similar seeds and one of these seeds is bound to allow you to predict the next reset token. Best example I can think of but surely CSPRNGs must have some sort of flaw and I haven't even touched upon the various types of side channel attacks like differential fault analysis by lagging the server or injecting predictable faults into the web app to get consistent enough environmental noise to get a predictable seed to appear allowing token prediction that way. The second attack is theoretically possible because it's a known flaw where when a Linux box is first booted up the first few numbers from dev/urandom has the lowest entropy but I believe this issue was fixed I just remember reading it somewhere.",

I discovered that Cybersecurity isn't a first job so my intention is find a job as Java Backend Developer and after a few years of experience I'll look for security jobs.\n\nOf all the roles I have seen the ones I am most curious about are the ones mentioned in the title.\n\nI don't understand how they differ from each other, are they synonyms for the same role ?\n\nWith a few years of experience as a backend developer can you get into these roles ?\n\nDo you have advice on the top people in this area to follow on Twitter ? Do you know of communities ? Conferences to participate in ?",

I had a conversation with a physics teacher about this but I am an IT student who also studies cybersecurity in his spare time and maybe there's something I'm not getting but if a setting is this easy why is it not implemented?",

        "text": "Quick question regarding this. If someone were to send packets to capture a handshake and isn’t actively transmitting deauth packets, is it still possible to detect where exactly the attack is coming from? I’m aware that wireshark can detect the signal strength of the packets but ultimately wouldn’t you need a spectrum analyzer to see exactly where it’s coming from? Also what if they put a piece of tinfoil or something to weaken/strengthen the signal to make it appear further/closer to the device than it actually is. Cheers.",

So we had a guy that worked as a coordinator for our company for 23 years and then quit to go start up his own company that is exactly the same. We are a company that has government contracts as we are a subcontractor. So the woman that does the background checks and payroll, who has also been employed with the company for over a decade, let us know this week that she was leaving to go work for his company . Today we found in her deleted folder in her email, that she was sending something to him monthly since September that said \"file synchronization\" but because the email it deleted, we cant see the the whole thing. The first time it said that the synchronization failed, but then said it was successful and since then, a new email goes each month that says the same thing. We use outlook, invoicing software and a CRM. Our IT guy is currently looking into it but in the mean time, just wanted some opinions on what maybe this could be ? I think of good potential hires but why wouldnt she just email him those? has to be more than that... Thanks in advance!",

At the end of the course my students have to setup an environment with an AD and some clients, document networking and do a bit of python. In relation to this, the students have to setup VPN connectivity for signing on to the AD from remote networks. And this is where my question stems from. \n\nA few students have used ZeroTier as a free VXLAN service. I haven't taught this, as anything more than a simple PPTP VPN is extracurricular. I understand why the students have gone this route, I wished we didn't have to deal with 3 layers of NAT at my school, and I get the concept. I'm just not sure if I'd want to use a *free* service for transporting my traffic, while also providing the software that handles the keys. It just screams of begging to a MitM attack\n\n**TL;DR:**\nHave you considered/analyzed ZeroTier, or the like, for use in production?",
