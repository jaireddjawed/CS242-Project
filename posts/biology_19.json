Btw Im double vaccinated(first dose in July 2021 and second dose in late September 2021) I do have a box of test kits but I want to try and only do them if I actually need to . I'm just confused because I know a lot of people if they have smoked quite a bit, then they can have an intense ongoing cough but yea \n\nAlso I feel annoyed at myself for feeling like this, but I know that the main reason for the increase in my health/death anxiety is because of a time when I had to go to hospital when I was younger(12, and I'm early twenties now) and I had to have surgery in hospital for sh, and I didn't think it was affecting me for up until six months ago when I started to have upsetting emotions about what happened and that's why I'm so terrified of having to go back into that hospital environment\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/10zlowc)",

        "text": "Hello guys! Most of the important information is in the title but I’ll expand a bit here. I’m 17 years old and currently studying in high school.\n\nRecently I’ve been able to talk to one of the researchers in my local university, her speciality is biology and especially bacterias. I’m very passionate about being able to work in the future in the laboratory and she showed me around. It was unbeliavably cool and it fired me up.\n\nShe texted me not too long ago that she wouldn’t mind doing some mini-research on the topic that interests me in a lab and I haven’t been able to sit still from that moment lol. We’ve already discussed some things that for sure will be present in our research, for example:\n1. We are working only with bacterias.\n2. The topic should be manageable for 2 people, one without any knowledge about working in a lab lmao.\n3. We will be working with MALDI. \n\nI’ve been breaking my head for a topic that might be interesting for a couple of days already, but everything I’ve come up is seeing what bacterias are present on fresh and expired food. It seems interesting but I can’t help but think that there is something more out there. \n\nIf you have any ideas what would be good to research for a high-school student, not groundbreaking and new, but still interesting and open for results I would be very happy! Accepting any advice, papers, articles that you might have on the the topic! Thank you! \n\n(If there is any grammar mistakes please do let me know, since English is my 3rd language and I’m looking forward to impoving my skill).",

        "text": "So we know the seminiferous tubules are the micro ducts in the testicle where the sperms and sperm stem cells are stored in males, and there exists a blood-testis-barrier inside the inner layer of the seminiferous tubules that has tight-junctions formed by Sertoli cells. However, this barrier only isolates those spermatocytes and mature sperm cells from the rest of the body, while the spermatogonia stem cells are still located outside of the blood-testis barrier, that they are not protected by it like the mature sperm cells. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/evi4cgm.jpg\n\nBut from some histo pictures, we can see that there are a layer of peritubular myoid cells which formed the Tunica Propia membrane that surrounds the outer most of the seminiferous tubules right next to those spermatogonia stem cells. Does this membrane also present function that acts as tight-junctions or a secondary barrier that is similar to the blood-testis-barrier inside the tubules, which blocks and filters certain molecules from the outside tissues diffusing into the spermatogonia stem cells? \n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/azVRlkTZmO8",

But it couldn't be the only reason as to why this relatively stable molecule need to be both produced and degraded at high pace. \nOf course, part of it is metabolized to different types of molecules, but a fraction just gets excreted through bile acid, like most oxysterol. \nThis constant flux of cholesterol seems to be contributing to vescicle trafficking, since it favorites high curvature of lipid membranes. Nonetheless couldn't recycling be almost enough to maintain a fitting rate of vescicle trafficking? \nCan someone please elaborate on this?",

        "text": "Ok so, men and women, physiologically speaking, are very different from each other. I don’t really feel like mentioning all of them, but just to list off the ones on the top of my head. Men have penises, produce more testosterone than estrogen and are generally stronger than women due to their larger size, denser bones and ability to amass muscular strength more easily. Women meanwhile have vaginas and breasts, produce more estrogen than testosterone, posses the ability to give birth to children through their wombs and are better at surviving famines than men due to requiring less food. These of course are far from the ONLY things different between the two sexes, but I think the ones I’ve listed already paint a pretty clear picture of the fact that men and women are quite different from each other.\n\nNow, I’ll admit, evolutionary biology isn’t my strong suit in the realm of science but my general understanding is that whatever the reason for the existence of these differences between the two sexes may’ve been, it must’ve been in service of propagating our species via sexual reproduction. Here’s what I want to know though:\n\nHave the physiological differences between men and women been with us throughout the entirety of history from the moment we spawned into existence, or did there used to be only a single sex in the ancient past that eventually split into two to speed up sexual reproduction? If it’s the latter, at what point in history did this happen?",
