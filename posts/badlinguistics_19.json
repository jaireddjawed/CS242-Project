        "text": "I don't know what are the rules about posting about non-internet things (if that helps, most of it happened through emails, so that would be on the internet). Anyway I'd like to share this.\n\nI work research in Italy, and obviously people use a lot of English vocabulary. It is very common to take English verbs and conjugate them the Italian way. The other day at a seminar someone interrupted the speaker to say this practice is bad Italian and should be avoided, especially since there are non-Italian native speakers in the audience and they need to learn proper Italian. (side note: I have been in that institute for years and the seminars are pretty much always in Italian, a lot of people don't even bother asking if everybody understands it, but suddenly on that day *won't somebody think of the foreigners* became important)\n\nThis was followed by a long mail that managed to sound even more condescending than pedantic. The core of the problem seemed to be the use of the verbs **matchare** and **plottare**. Granted, *to match* and *to plot* have Italian translations in dictionaries, but in the specific context of our work (this was not a general public seminar) the English term conveys a more precise and immediate meaning. I think the argument that *\"our language is rich and beautiful so let's love and respect it\"* (I quote) is ridiculous. By the way nobody would say \"ho *matched* questi cataloghi\", people say \"ho *matchato* questi cataloghi\". That's Italian conjugation applied to an English verb. \n\nIf you digest words from other origins and integrate them to your own speech, following the usual patterns of your own language, doesn't that precisely prove your language is alive, and not at threat? Actually in the \"my language can beat up your language\" paradigm, would be a sign of Italian being stronger than English, since in order to be accepted in a sentence the immigrant English word has to abide by the Italian grammar.\n\nLast thing: complaining about constructions that sound like \"screeching cacophonies\". It reminds me of the \"on accident\" infamous debate in English. In all languages you will find constructions that are the way they are for purely arbitrary reasons. Hell, even French/Spanish/Italian don't always use the same prepositions. I guess invoking the \"screeching cacophony\" argument must feel like the ultimate winning move for people whose reasoning relies on the eternal \"it is wrong because I don't like it because it's wrong\" cycle of truth.\n\n**I guess I need to explain why it is bad linguistics...** Loanwords do not *ruin* a language, especially when they are used in very specific contexts and to describe concepts or situations that we deal with on a daily basis but people in the times of Dante Alighieri didn't.",

        "text": "From a post on 4chan in the /his/ (History and Humanities) board, in a thread (at least to begin with; it branched out slightly) about the topic of hanja mixed script in Korea:\n\n&gt; someone who is dumb is essentially incapable of communicating. hanzi sets the bar very high.\n\n&gt; it stops the devolution of language to a very large extent, which is why even modern chinese is very archaic in many respects.\n\n&gt; a good example is fallacious concepts such as \"mansplaining\" it just doesn't work in east asian languages. or the subtle shift in meaning of words, such as racism shifting from judging people unfairly based on race, to something that whites do exclusively against blacks, and never vice versa.\n\n&gt; if you're familiar with sapir whorf or similar linguistic theories, hanzi essentially stops dead in its tracks a number of logical fallacies, full bar.\n\n&gt; n stuf liek dis and shieeet just doesn't work in hanzi. those people can't communicate, and are aware of it, and are forced into shame and silence.\n\nBadling: the idea of \"the devolution of a language\" is nonsense, as is the idea that certain concepts \"just don't work\" in some languages; the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is used completely seriously as support. That's not comprehensive, but it's most of what's wrong.\n\nEDIT: Later in the same thread he went on to say:\n\n&gt; lots of science has been \"discredited\" by the peer review process. you realize peer review is incredibly corrupt, right?\n\n&gt; to pretend that sapir whorf isn't applicable, you would have to pretend that words don't subtly shift meaning depending on context without strict lexical rules.\n\n&gt; look at the word \"tolerate.\" tolerate went from something you begrudgingly accept, but disapprove of, to something which you love, applaud, and laud the virtues of.\n\n&gt; compare the sentences\n\n&gt; \"I tolerate his abuses.\" vs \"he does not tolerate gays.\" surely in the latter example the racist kkk member DOES tolerate gays, he disapproves, it is obvious, but he does not harass them. but the problem is that he does not CELEBRATE gays. that makes him \"intolerant\"\n\n&gt; it's called signal amplification. traditional societies and registers within languages generally limit this. hanzi does an excellent job of this. to deny that sapir whorf exists, you will have to deny signal amplification, whereby words take on increasingly extreme meanings, thereby CHANGING the way individuals think about the concept and limiting the scope of thought of which they are capable\n\n&gt; a more cogent example is of COMMUNIST CENSORSHIP. if sapir whorf was false, then chinese would be able to think \"freely\" despite censorship because a lack of words and information does not constrain thought.\n\n&gt; YET surely someone like you would surely say that censorship HAS indeed hindered chinese thought. that means sapir whorf is correct.\n\nNot sure if he's serious at this point.\n\nEDIT: And now he said: \n\n&gt; are you suggesting that the register of a language is unrelated to struture, that the ability of words to rapidly morph, or inability thereof, is unrelated to structure, or that the ambiguities in a language lack the ability to confuse people, thereby influencing their thought?\n\n&gt; because if you argued any of the above, I'd call you an idiot.\n\n&gt; strawmanning sapir whorf with \"news anchor\" vs \"news woman\" doesn't disprove it.\n\n&gt; if the lexical structure of a language is fixed, leading to precise clarity and an inability to intentionally lie to people, that influences the thoughts the users of the language have.\n\nEDIT: Yet more from the same guy:\n\n&gt;1. if chinese can think freely, then there is no problem with censorship, according to you. \n\n&gt; 2. hanzi serves as an iq test as a barrier to any given conversation. it's an iq test that functions in real life, and prevents movements like black lives matter from even getting off the ground.\n\n&gt; 3. china is no longer communist you idiot. and well, if you look at north korea, they also use hangul \"for the people.\" I usually exclude worst korea because it's an outlier in any discussion.\n\n&gt; 4.&gt;sapir whorf\n\n&gt; I never said hanja alone did this\n\n&gt; 种族主义 is translated as racism\n\n&gt; literally translated it means racial doctrine, or species doctrine\n\n&gt; this FIXES the meaning because of how explicit it is. no one can go around saying that it's impossible for blacks to be racist against whites because of *manufactured excuse* racism=power+prejudice.\n\n&gt; no. that's not how it works. it's a racial doctrine. excplicitly. this is a function of the language, being agglutinative, made more explicit by the hanja\n\n&gt; it also makes it harder to deny that race exists. coming from the characters, variously, the charaters for type, or clan. you can no more deny that race exist in chinese or japanese than you can deny that clans, families, or types of people exist. the concept is made plainly abundant because the language is rooted in reality, in this particular concept. there is little room for deception.\n\n&gt; denying sapir whorf, you are essentially saying that every environment is an ideal environment for conveying information. which is fucking STUPID. languages convey ambiguity. sometimes on PURPOSE. that structure then influences how we think.\n\n&gt; look at quantitative representations in language. japanese in particular has very precise ways of describing probability AND how one arrived at the conclusion one did. in western languages we just have \"probably.\"\n\n&gt; it becomes more explicit how one came to the conclusions one did. less gossip",
