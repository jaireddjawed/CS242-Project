Be sure to smash that UPVOTE button and SUBSCRIBE! \n\nThank you to our 2022 BOBOLA Sponsors Dewey, Cheatem, &amp; Howe Law Offices LLP - call them for any and all of your legal needs. They'll make someone pay!\n\nAt 10am EST r/BoBOLA will populate with the series of nominations posts. I've even been a responsible mod and flaired them all \"nomination thread\" so that you can streamline your nominating. \n\n\"But Thor, you handsome devil!\" You say, hopefully not remembering that I've used this mediocre literary device before, \"How does one nominate something for a BOBOLA Award?\"\n\n\"Well, little BOLArina, have I got an explanation for you!\" I cry out, rather dramatically. \"You go to a nomination thread and then link the relevant LA/BOLA post/comment as instructed in the nomination thread and briefly explain why it should get the award. Did someone else already comment what you wanted to nominate? In that case, reply to their top level comment with 'Seconded!' or 'Wow, you beat me to it, buns really are super quick. I would also like to nominate this post for this award!'. And that, my dear little BOLArina, is how you nominate something for an award.\"\n\nNominations are open for TWO WHOLE WEEKS - until sometime on December 19th when I remember to lock all the posts. I'll remind you about it probably twice more. After that, I'll don my [newsbun mod hat](https://i.etsystatic.com/20004728/r/il/9f8c02/3628374313/il_340x270.3628374313_ocyy.jpg) and put together the voting threads. \n\nIt's been real, guys. Thanks again to Dewey, Cheatem, and Howe, LLP who WILL make someone pay! Don't forget to smash that UPVOTE button and SUBSCRIBE!!",

Perhaps you are one of the nearly one-hundred thousand new subscribers who joined in the last year and find this confusing. Fear not, little newbie, for [here are last year's winners](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/rra0y1/your_2021_bobola_winners_are_here/) which should give you a fine sense for proceedings.\n\nOn to the vitally important nitty gritty details that I shall regularly remind you of for the ensuing  month (or perhaps beseech either u/ilikecheeseforreal or u/idontknowhowtopm to do so in my stead).\n\nOn Monday, December 5th, 2022 a series of posts shall populate r/BoBoLA, each being a nomination thread for one of this years BOBOLA Award categories. Once nominations are complete, voting shall commence. Upon completion of voting, winners shall be announced. At this time we will all engage in our favorite vices in a glorious party at \\[redacted\\].\n\nBelow I shall list each of this year's award categories and a brief description of them. The name of the award is subject to change based on how grumpy u/demyst is feeling or how cheeky I am feeling (if an award name appears to change for ANY OTHER REASON please notify via modmail and escalate to admins *immediately*).\n\nThe 2022 BOBOLA Categories are:\n\n* MVB - Most Valuable BOLArina - Given to the best poster of the year\n* Hot Take Artist of the Year - Given to the best commenter of the year\n* LA Comment of the Year - Given to the best comment on [r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/) this year\n* The Lifetime Movie Award - Given to the LA/BOLA comment/post that is the most wholesome giving us all the warm and fuzzies befitting a cozy Lifetime Movie (but not one of the weird true crime ones with the poor acting and macabre subject matter)\n* Prince of Titles Award - Given to the best BOLA title\n* Bootleg Radio Edit Award - Given to the best retitle in the BOLA comments\n* Trickle Truth Award - Given to the post wherein LAOP *really* buried the lede\n* BOLA Post of the Year - Given to, um, well, you know, the best post\n* BOLA Comment of the Year - Given to, um, well, you know, the best comment\n* Subthread that Needs to be Awarded Award - Given to the subthread of a  BOLA post wherein such shenanigans occurred that must be remembered by  future BOLArinas. A candidate subthread could be: a good run of puns, a  good run of jokes, BOLArinas sassing BOLArinas, mods sassing BOLArinas,  BOLArinas sassing mods, mods sassing mods, or anything that just seems  worthy of remembering ~~forever~~ until Elon buys reddit and it crashed and burns\n* The Wakefield Award for Disgraced Research - Given to the best anti-vaxx post of the year\n\nOccasionally throughout the year we have solicited ideas for new awards, or perhaps seen one suggested and said \"Hey, remind me of that when BOBOLA comes around\". Now would be an excellent time to suggest a new award or remind me of an award I thought was a good idea but then summarily forgot because I am very distractable.\n\nWith all of the love in my [True](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgwm4pth8LI) [steel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgSsC1TSL5M) [heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4q4mrWoXyI),\n\nThor\\_The\\_Bunny",
