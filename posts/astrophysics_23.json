Just like oil, we can't \"see\" the water, but we exist in the medium, and it's forcing us together and constantly repelling us from itself (dark energy).\n\nIs this completely off-base, or did my mind finally wrap around what physicists have been talking about for years?

I was also provided with a script from someone who's considered a pro at miriad (I can't remember his name currently, sorry) that's to help me reduce the data.\n\nFor some reason, most of the sets are having all their data flagged. There are 3 sets out of about 18 that don't have the data flagged. The script always fails at \"task invert: no visibilities to plot\". Has anyone ever had this problem? And a possible fix?\n\nI've tried not flagging any of the data myself (so it tries to use all of it). I've tried flagging parts of the data (specific times or a telescope for the entire reading). Neither of those seems to have an impact on making the script not flag all the data. Both the guy I'm working under and the grad student I'm working with are just as confused and cannot understand what's happening.\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "Hi, I'm an aspiring Astronomer. I won't get too deep into my background here other than I'm 23, live in Seattle WA, I'm engaged, and I've never wanted to do anything more in my life than be an astronomer. \n\nThis isn't a question about what my potential careers are going to be. I'm not worried about that. What I want to know is about the schooling process. Right now I'm a freshman at a community college working to get my 2 year transfer degree to the UW for Astronomy. Maybe possibly I might want to continue after my BS with a doctorate but I don't want to get too ahead of myself. \n\nThe question is, how hard and in depth is the schooling. While looking at the courses required for astronomy I noticed it's basically just tons and tons of physics classes. Everyone I have ever talked to said that physics is impossibly hard and that I shouldn't go for this degree because it's useless. None of them have a degree in anything physics or science related. Obviously I want to prove them wrong. This is the only thing I want to do with my life. But I'm a little worried. I'm getting married this summer (between 1st and 2nd year at community college) and right now I'm working delivering pizzas on the weekend. I guess what I want to know is that this type of school is possible for a person in my position. I'm not 18 years old. I didn't graduate high school. I got my GED and spent the last couple years gradually taking community college classes under the 100 level just to be able to start my transfer degree. I'm going to be married soon. I guess I'm just worried that, because I'm not a typical straight-out-of-high-school student, I'm not going to make it. NO ONE thinks I can do this except for my fiancee. Obviously I'm very down on myself about this. I'm trying my 110% hardest to keep up my spirit and do this for myself one step at a time but I would just like some reassurance. \n\nSo I ask you, r/astrophysics, is it possible for me to get this degree? What circumstances did you have when you went to school? Were you married? Did you have a job while you went? Did you have support from family(emotionally and financially)? I would feel really comforted knowing that others have struggled through things like this and came out on top. \n\n-main question I have: Did you work part time while you were in school? If so, was it hard with the amount of school work you had to do?\n\nI really appreciate anyone taking the time to read this. If these questions are too personal for you to answer then please, skip them. But I would like to hear your opinion on the matter. \n\n\n\n\n*edit: I typed too fast.\n\n*update: Thank you to everyone who has replied. Your words are very encouraging. I am taking my education very seriously and it's very nice to have people reply in a serious and thoughtful manor. ",

However, with my limited experience, it does seem a viable possibility, so I may as well ask:\n\nIs it possible that dark matter could actually be matter that is concealed within the additional spatial dimensions proposed by string theory?  Since extra dimensions are not, at this point, able to be observed, might dark matter be able to nestle right along with that quality of an extra dimension? Another product of dark matter is the bending of light. We know it's there, but we just can't find it. What if we can't see it because we are only looking for it among the traditional three spatial dimensions?  The mass would still have a presence within the fabric of space, but from a 3-dimensional standpoint, it wouldn't appear to exist.\n\nNow maybe this has already been looked into, or maybe it's not even possible. Either way, I would really appreciate any responses, so that I may have a better understanding of why it would/would not work!",

Now, obviously, a year is the amount of time it takes for the Earth to orbit around the Sun.\n\nObjectively, however, what is a year?  Suppose humans had somehow come to life on Pluto, and that was our frame of reference.  Since a year on Pluto is longer than a year on Earth, how would we calculate the age of the universe?  Or what if, again somehow, we weren't orbiting any star, and we did not have that frame of reference?\n\nThe question I'm trying to get at is, is there some sort of universal constant (not an Earth year) that is used for this calculation?  If not, how accurate is our current calculation? ",

She has gotten some interest from a couple of graduate schools but doesn't think that she is up for six more years of school.  She doesn't currently have any industry experience but got a summer of research experience at lowell observatory and some experience at our school's instrumentation lab.

        "text": "I guess calling it a theory is a little much, more like conjecture that I'm hoping to get some input on. It goes something like this.\n\n\nIt's been theorized before that our universe actually contains large amounts of antimatter, but the idea was refuted on the basis that this would cause a large amount of gamma radiation release at the edge of these regions of space. \n\n\nI believe however, that this may not be the case. Or rather that it is the case, but that the gamma radiation is undetectable for reasons I will explain.\n\n\nWhat started me on this train of thought was the thought that if antimatter regions of space existed, they likely have stars comprised of antimatter as well. Now, if these stars are traveling reverse in time, as Feynman theorized about antimatter, from our point of view they would be regions of space that act as a sink for massive amounts of energy as antimatter helium broke down into hydrogen.We would also see low levels of gamma radiation absorption. \n\n\n\nNow this would mean that from our point of view, matter-antimatter annihilation at the edges of these regions would produce gamma radiation, which would then be sucked toward the antimatter sun. This seems a little far-fetched unless you consider the idea of retrocausality, which would not be that far fetched in a region of space running in reverse time. From the \"view\" of the antimatter universe, these border regions would be absorbing gamma radiation to produce matter and antimatter, in which case it makes perfect sense for that gamma radiation to be coming from the nearest source, the anti-star.\n\nI know this seems a little far fetched, and we obviously need to learn more about antimatter and antimatter-matter interactions before we can really know, but from a theoretical standpoint, is there any reason it couldn't be possible? It would account for the presence of dark matter and dark energy, as well as for why it appears like we live in a matter-dominated universe. \n\n",

I understand there are a lot of other physics issues here (ie: the pull of the planet's gravity on the moon itself, and so forth) but for the sake of somewhat simplification i'm treating the as gravity Earth-like.\n\nSo, what I am wondering mostly is on Day/Night cycles, and how it would look on this particular moon. For the sake of simplification, again, I am also assuming it takes 24 hours for the moon to do a full rotation and that the moon orbits the planet every 28 days. My understanding leads me to believe that if this was the case that 14 of those days would be spent getting progressively longer day (including the light from the planet itself reflecting on to the moon) followed by progressively longer nights for the next 14, like a condensed version of the arctic day/nights.\n\nSo, am I way off? Or am i slightly on the right track? \n\nThanks in advance.",
