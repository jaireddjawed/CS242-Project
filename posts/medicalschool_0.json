If you just open a book and it reads: \"So and so was happy and everything went well. The end.\" you'd want your money back. Some terrible, insurmountable obstacle has to befall the protagonist for a story to even be possible. Also wouldn't be much of a story of the protagonist was simply defeated: \"The dragon ate his head off. The end.\" No. You need a training montage. A revenge mission. A period of reflection. Those are the elements of a good story. Some of you are staring down the bad guy in your story right now. Remind yourself that it's not failure that terminates the story, it's what the main character decides to do about it. Collect yourself and make it an ending worth reading.",

I went from Rads applicant to SOAPing GS Prelim and receiving the categorical interviews for surgery to having to wait till late 4th round for one of the last spots possible. This is the most humbling experience and will alter my outlook for the foreseeable future. I don’t wish this wretched day against my worst \nenemy. Please to all applicants of 2024, don’t apply to your competitive specialty with the fall back plan of just snagging a prelim in the SOAP (maybe I’m the only idiot who applied to very few TY/prelims to save money). Just pay the extra money and apply for prelims to avoid the SOAP. It’s unpredictable and more anxiety inducing than waiting for your Step scores to be released with added bonus of making you feel insignificant and disposable as each program dwindles with each passing hour. Then, at your lowest point, asking your program and mentors to reach out to these programs or hoping for a late phone call. I just wanna give a shout-out to my classmates who watched Ted Lasso with me as my self worth became less and less. You guys helped me from simply giving up and becoming a jaded 25 year old.

He also has a heavy student debt burden.\n\nDoes this mean his current salary will be used to calculate my REPAYE payments even though he will no longer have a salary by then?

I don’t enjoy it or find it remotely interesting and would like to pursue a PhD in medicine. \n\nI’ve looked at options to study and (understandably) everyone suggests A-levels over an access course. I work full time and would still intend to do so until being accepted into a university so going back to college isn’t much of an option. \n\nThis limits me to online learning via Distance Learning Centre who are QAA approved which from what they say can allow mature students to do a year of online study part time and be accepted into Medical School.  \n\nCan anyone tell me if they have any experience with this or if I’m doing the correct thing choosing this route, I will have to pay for the course as I don’t qualify for government grants due to already holding a level 3 qualification in my industry. \n\nAny help would be appreciated as I would hate to spend this money and still be stuck in a job I’m not passionate about.\n\nThank you",
