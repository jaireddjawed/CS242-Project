        "text": "So I was an IT consultant in Singapore supporting some IBM based financial systems software.\n\nUsual job is fly, in stay at the Hilton 5 days, and fly out. Pretty great work (not job). \n\nBeing the keen expat employee who thought he knew it all and was keen to learn it all, I was sent off to post Marcos Philippines to assist the International Rice Research Institute to setup the systems out of Manila at a place called Los Baños, Laguna. \n\nOn arrival we were shown our accommodation on site, not the usual hotel. I asked to see it before working. It was horrid roach infested non-air conditioned rooms. I told them NO, I am not staying here and I am not starting work until I know where I am staying. A couple of hours and we were offered the executive accommodation, which upon inspection was A.O.K.\n\nWork was interesting as no-one seemed to know how to load the software onto the mainframe. I had never done it before but was like \"How hard can this be?\", we started and I just go stuck in and got it started.   \n\nOn return to the accommodation that night we passed a guard post with a guard asleep and a machine gun at his feet, pretty common in some parts of the world I learned latter, but not in Singapore/Australia/Japan etc. that I was used to.\n\nAnyway around 3 a.m. I hear gun shots in the distance and this got me keenly aware of just how far out in the boon docks we were. In the morning staff at breakfast were \"yeah it was machine gun fire from the communist/rebels\". OK...\n\nNeedless to say I was keenly aware that I was the one of a few white faces around and as keen observer of the press knew that Americans were the target of kidnappings.  I am not American but being white I sure looked like one.\n\nI was there for three weeks and thus at weekends went to Manila (2.5 hours back then travel) to the safety of a decent hotel with a mini bar. I drunk the mini bar dry and tried every cocktail on the menu and survived.\n\nOn return to Singapore I asked the CEO if we had kidnap insurance. No, okay I am not returning to IRRI. And thus I was safe.  I worked in Manila several times over the years and like the people who are great, hard working and very welcoming.\n\nThere were a lot of other reasons not to go back but I used the lack of insurance as one and they saved time and money by using me elsewhere. That employer was the worst I ever had, incompetent and cheap, and lazy on every level. But I learnt a lot as I had no backup and support was non existent.\n\nUse a job as long as you are building skills and getting paid, never accept unnecessary risks. When they piss you off, remember to make them pay.",

        "text": "I am an evening dispatcher for a smaller town water department, and part of my duties include catching calls after several other city departments have closed for the day, meaning, I get to tell several people per day that I can't do what they want and for them to try back tomorrow when that department is open. The city itself has ruled I'm not even allowed to help if personal info is involved, especially finances. I do get questions for those departments that I can actually answer, most of the time (what time they open, trash pickup schedules, late return library fees, etc).  \n\nThe main reason my job exists is to field emergency calls, like reports of water coming out of the road, or sending an on-call crew to zip over and turn off someone's water at the meter if they have an uncontrolled leak inside which is causing damage, coordinate crews out in the field with where they need to go, log when they arrived where, and state-related reporting. \n\nHowever, a few callers interpret \"emergency\" as \"I need to take a shower because I'm stinky from work and I have a date,\" to which \"call tomorrow when they're open\" type responses will simply not do and will try to argue the motive behind a rule I didn't come up with (getting your water turned back on due to payment processed is finance-related and disallowed for me). \n\nI've been talking with my supervisor about this together we've crafted a kind of script of how to handle the super special people who just won't accept that I can't help them. One idea of mine was to perfect a very stern enunciation of CORRECT, to answer the zinger they often try to throw out, \"So you're saying this dumpster smelling up my alley can't be picked up today?\" to encompass a tone implying, \"CONGRATULATIONS on somehow stumbling across the entire point of every answer I've given you this whole call.\"\n\nMy supervisor (who often tells me about what she saw on Judge Judy recently, if that tells you anything about her) will sometimes even greet me in passing or at the door of the dispatch office and with a mock-crying, \"So you won't help me today?\" that I can practice it on. Not yelling, just a stern enunciation is the best way I can describe it, laced with a \"Bingo, Sherlock\" backspin.\n\nI finally got to use it yesterday, and the conversation went a little like this. Responses are a little wordier that what I'd normally say, in order to obfuscate certain details, etc. Keep in mind that easily 98% of calls don't go any deeper than 1-2 responses, because they actually let me explain; it's just that this one would simply not accept rejection and kept interrupting.\n\nK: Hi, I just got home, saw the water had been turned off, and paid my bill online. When will you be out  today to turn it back on?\n\nMe: It won't be turned on today if you paid it after 5pm; the department which handles those finances is closed and they have to process it first to send out a tech. This is an emergency line for things like..\n\nK: (interrupts) But my bill is paid. I have the receipt number, and the money shows taken out of my bank!\n\n(My supervisor walks in, grinning because she can hear I got a wild karen calling and is entertained by my refusal to get riled up by them)\n\nMe: The department who handles bill payments, is closed. They will have to process it tomorrow when they return, 8-5. This line is for people who are reporting water coming up out..\n\nK: (interrupts) But I'm speaking to you, now, and you know that it is paid, so you can just send someone out to turn it on now.\n\nMe: But I'm telling you the department which handles that, which is not me, is closed, so it will be processed no sooner than 8am tomorrow.\n\nK: I don't understand why you can't just send someone out to turn it on.\n\nMe: We do not handle billing concerns in any way including turn-ons after payment is made; this is an *e-mer-gen-cy line* for people who are reporting pipe breaks in the road, or if..\n\nK: (interrupts) WELL THIS IS AN EMERGENCY! I have children and I need to take a shower BEFORE I GO TO WORK TOMORROW!\n\nMe: (slightly louder tone, but slower) The department which handles the kind of service you need is. only. open. 8. to. 5. \n\nK: BUT! \n\nMe: YOU will have to contact them during. those. hours.\n\nK: WELL THAT's NOT GOING TO F-ING *HELP ME* **TODAY**!\n\nME: ***CORRECT***.\n\nK: (stunned silence, papers shuffling, hangs up)\n\nSupv, who has been grinning like Michael Jackson eating popcorn hanging on every word, smiling wide and eyes bright: \\*gasp\\* And?\n\nMe: She hung up in stunned silence!\n\nSupv: It worked!\n\nMe, smiling brightly: Yeah! And she set it up so perfectly; she even swore in the last part! She was like, \"Well that's not going effing help me today!\" \n\nSupv: 'CORRECT!' It's like you almost got to swear at her back!

        "text": "(Per sub rules removed names, business and links)\n\nThis is a wild story!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo former  County information technology employees have been charged related to alleged theft and fraud schemes that spanned years and profited them nearly $4 million from stolen equipment and timecard fraud, charges say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEmployee Manager, 41, and Employee, 37, both have been separately charged in  County District Court with felony counts of theft by swindle — six against Employee Manager and two against Employee.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCharges say the theft scheme is alleged to have spanned over seven years starting in late 2012 and involved the theft and resale of “network switches,” which are computer hardware networking devices used in the transfer of data.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe timecard fraud scheme began in 2016 and revealed that Employee worked “few or no hours” over a period of years despite claiming 80 hours worked biweekly, charges say. Both schemes were perpetrated into early 2020 when both parties were terminated from their employment with the county.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe criminal complaints against Employee Manager and Employee explain that the two were in a romantic relationship with each other. Employee Manager hired Employee and was her direct supervisor responsible for, among other things, approving her timecard submissions and conducting her annual performance reviews.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEmployee Manager began his employment with the county in 2006 and was promoted in 2013 to the position of IT Network Enterprise Manager. Employee Manager’s duties included ordering network equipment, including network switches, for county use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEmployee began working for  County in 2016 as a member of the “voice team” with the responsibility of helping handle issues with county telephones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInvestigation begins\n\nCharges say an internal investigation began when questions arose from IT staff regarding Employee’ absence from work. The investigation determined that biweekly timecards submitted by Employee and approved by Employee Manager, her supervisor, in which Employee represented that she had worked 80 hours during the corresponding pay periods were routinely false.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile looking into the timecard fraud, investigating staff encountered security video showing that Employee Manager used his employee access card to enter the  County Government Center on three separate weekend days and took network access layer switches belonging to the county, collectively worth thousands of dollars, plus other unidentified equipment. Employee accompanied Employee Manager on one of those occasions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFollowing the discovery of the alleged thefts, the matters were referred for a criminal investigation, which uncovered evidence that Employee Manager had been taking county network switches and selling them, over a span of more than seven years, to buyers in Oklahoma who paid Employee Manager via PayPal. During that time, Employee Manager was the county employee responsible for managing its inventory of network switches. Employee Manager’s aggregate PayPal sales to the Oklahoma buyers totaled at least approximately $3.9 million between late 2012 and early 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTimecard fraud\n\nEmployee’ first day of work for  County was Feb. 2, 2016. Her timecards, which Employee Manager was responsible for reviewing and approving, reflect that she did not use a single hour of paid time off (PTO) between Feb. 2, 2016, and Jan. 31, 2020. According to her timecards, during every one of the biweekly pay periods in that time span, Employee worked 80 hours coded as regular work or some combination of regular work, comp time, and standard paid holidays. As of Monday, Feb. 3, 2020, Employee was suspended from work in connection with the internal investigation. She used PTO (along with the Presidents’ Day holiday) to be paid for the next three weeks until her employment was terminated as of Feb. 21.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeveral records indicate that Employee worked few or no hours despite her reporting on her timecards. These records include access card logs showing that Employee used her employee access card to enter secured areas of county buildings (such as the secured area in which her work space was located) only twice between Dec. 1, 2018, and Feb. 19, 2020; logs reflecting that actions such as saving or deleting files in Microsoft Office products on her assigned county laptop occurred only 22 times between Sept. 23, 2019, and Feb. 19, 2020, and that the majority of those 22 actions took place during her February 2020 suspension; evidence that she had rarely sent emails from her county address, and rarely read emails sent to that address, in the months leading up to Feb. 19, 2020; records indicating that she used her county desk phone for an aggregate total of 5 minutes and 21 seconds between Sept. 4, 2019, and Jan. 31, 2020, including no use at all after Sept. 26, 2019; and call records covering 11 months between February 2019 and February 2020 showing that she used her county mobile phone primarily for non-work-related calls. Finally, records establish that one of Employee’ and Employee Manager’s children was born on Monday, Sept. 19, 2016. Employee’ timecard for the period including that date, which Employee Manager approved, reflected that Employee worked 8 regular hours on the day their child was born, and continued to work regular hours with no PTO or other leave time thereafter. (Employee Manager used PTO on Sept. 19 and 20, 2016.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInvestigators learned that Employee Manager hired Employee in 2016 without following county processes to do so. Employee Manager told IT and HR staff looking into the Employee timecard issue that he had not kept any of the paperwork regarding her hiring process, as was required, and that he did not recall who else participated on the interview panel when Employee was hired. In an interview, one of Employee’ coworkers reported that although he was on the same team as she was, he did not interact with her and saw her only at a county training event. He said he knew of one project she had worked on. That project took place between February 2016 and March 2017, according to county personnel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrior to Employee’ suspension in February 2020, Employee Manager was the only person who approved her timecards during her tenure at  County. Between Sept. 19, 2016, and Jan. 31, 2020, based on timecards Employee submitted and Employee Manager approved,  County paid Employee for about 7,042 reported hours at rates of about $40 or more per hour (increasing over time as she was given raises based in part on her annual evaluations from Employee Manager), totaling more than $280,000, plus benefits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProperty thefts\n\nIn early March 2020, in reviewing recent employee card access logs for Employee and Employee Manager in connection with the internal timecard fraud investigation, investigating personnel observed that Employee Manager had used his access card in the  County Government Center on three recent weekend dates — Jan. 11, Jan. 19, and Feb. 9, 2020. Investigators were able to preserve and review security video for each of these dates. The footage showed Employee Manager (with Employee’ assistance on Jan. 11, and alone on Jan. 19 and Feb. 9) taking IT equipment, loading it into his personal vehicle in the Government Center parking ramp, and driving away. The equipment included unboxed network switches, boxes readily identifiable to county IT staff as containing network switches, and other boxes with unidentified contents. Access card logs do not show Employee Manager or Employee using a card to reenter the Government Center or any other county building after taking the equipment on those three days. In total, the videos appear to show Employee Manager taking 33 network switches (boxed and unboxed) in addition to the other unidentified equipment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time, network switches cost the county anywhere between about $1,170 and $15,210 per switch depending on model, meaning that the total cost of the 33 switches taken by Employee Manager in 2020 on Jan. 11 (12 switches), Jan. 19 (15 switches), and Feb. 9 (6 switches) would have been between about $38,610 and $504,930. From and after sometime in 2012 through the end of his employment tenure, Employee Manager was the county employee responsible for maintaining an appropriate number of switches on hand and for ordering switches from the vendor. Working hands-on with switches was not part of his job. Employee Manager did not keep a comprehensive inventory of switches.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInvestigators discovered records on Employee Manager’s county laptop indicating that he had received significant transfers of money from PayPal into a Financial Credit Union savings account and subpoenaed records of PayPal accounts associated with Employee Manager and the Wings account. In response, PayPal produced records for two accounts. The accounts were in the names of “Employee Manager” and “Employee.” Each was linked to a single bank account, the Wings savings account held solely in Employee Manager’s name. The “Employee Manager” PayPal account was active only briefly, between Aug. 31, 2012, and Sept. 11, 2012. The “Employee” PayPal account was active between Nov. 14, 2012, and July 8, 2020. Each account was associated with an email address that contained a letter and number string similar to Employee Manager’s county email signature and was the same as the letter and number string on a professional certification available through the technology company Cisco.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTransaction records for these two PayPal accounts show that between Sept. 4, 2012, and Feb. 17, 2020, the accounts received a gross total of $1,454,635 (all but $7,350 of which was received through the longer-lived “Employee” account) across about 180 payment receipts in amounts generally ranging between $6,000 and $10,000 per payment. Of the total amount received, $1,387,364.20 was withdrawn from PayPal directly to Employee Manager’s  savings account. (The records show that the difference between the total gross received and the total withdrawn to the Wings account is primarily attributable to PayPal transaction fees.) Some transaction records included descriptive notes indicating that the items sold were Cisco Catalyst 3850 network switches (“3850 switches”).  County used and Employee Manager was responsible for ordering and maintaining the county’s inventory of that type of switch between about March 2013 and December 2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInvestigators obtained additional bank records for Employee Manager and noted that an account in his name included sizable deposits from PayPal similar to the ones received in the account. A subpoena to PayPal for records of any account linked to that Wells Fargo account yielded records of another PayPal account, this one in Employee Manager’s own name, with an associated email address, which was active between Feb. 28, 2000, and July 8, 2020. This account included more and a wider variety of transactions than the “Employee” and “Employee Manager” accounts, but also included about 340 additional payment receipts between May 11, 2012, and April 3, 2020, from the same customers who purchased switches from the other accounts. Many of those transactions similarly included notes indicating that the items sold were 3850 switches. The payments again often ranged from $6,000 to $10,000 each, and totaled $2,462,642.50 in gross, of which $2,175,272.11 was withdrawn to Employee Manager’s account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPayPal records indicate the customer for the overwhelming majority of the sales transactions recorded across these three PayPal accounts (including but not limited to the transactions with notes indicating they involved 3850 switches) was one of three individuals with Oklahoma addresses — R.N., J.N., and R.B. — or Oklahoma-based companies controlled by those individuals. An investigator interviewed R.N. and R.B. Each indicated that he was in the business of reselling electronic equipment, and that J.N. was R.N.’s brother and in that business as well. R.N. and R.B. both confirmed that they regularly purchased network switches from someone in they knew as Employee Manager, and that they paid Employee Manager via PayPal for those purchases. R.N. recalled that the equipment he purchased from Employee Manager was sometimes (though not always) new and priced close to retail. R.B. also said that some of the equipment he purchased from Employee Manager appeared new or nearly new, while some of it showed signs of being used.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn investigator interviewed Employee Manager by telephone on July 8, 2020. Employee Manager indicated that he did not recall the incidents in January and February of that year during which security video showed him removing network switches from the Government Center, but he said it would not be uncommon for him to act as depicted in the footage. He said he went to the Government Center for work “all the time,” including on weekends. He said he might well have taken network switches off-site to “restore them” or “get them ready,” and that he did occasionally bring equipment home and later bring it back “to another site or to the Government Center.” Employee Manager denied that he had ever kept or sold any switches himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe telephone interview, which took place before investigators obtained any PayPal records, ended at approximately 2:46 p.m. Central time on July 8, 2020. The PayPal records obtained later show that at 12:54 p.m. Pacific time — or 2:54 p.m. Central, less than 10 minutes after the interview ended — the “Employee” PayPal account was closed. PayPal records similarly indicate that at 12:57 p.m. Pacific the same day, the other PayPal account was closed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn investigator interviewed a person who worked under Employee Manager and then took over Employee Manager’s role after his county employment was terminated. The person confirmed to the investigator that, in performing what used to be Employee Manager’s job, he does not work hands-on with network switches. The person told the investigator he observed that asset management was “a mess” when he took over Employee Manager’s position, and that inventory was not being tracked, managed, or monitored. The person who replaced Employee Manager recalled that while Employee Manager was employed, he would order pallets of equipment and tell his staff that the pallets were off-limits and that no one should touch the equipment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe criminal complaint against Employee Manager states that between January 2018 and April 2020 he received various payments through PayPal totaling $1,080,784 for sales to the buyers in Oklahoma.",

        "author": "GT3Red",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/zapsnc/a_really_expensive_move/",
        "text": "Moving office is a big deal. It's also a big pain in the arse. And I don't just mean having to dig all the chocolate bars out of the deepest depths of your desk drawers, I mean moving all the IT servers and desktops, and getting a working network established in a new building too. This is something that has eased a bit with cloud computing making on-site server rooms less crowded, but depending on the business and the size of said business there might still be a lot of hardware. Cloud is expensive, so if you are running serious IT it's often still cheaper to have it on-site. This story is about a law firm, and to demonstrate how big of a deal moving just a few miles is I'll link to this article about Clifford Chance moving from Canary Wharf (reclaimed dock area in East central London that's now a very fancy business and housing area) to central Londons \"square mile\". They have publiclly announced their move 6 YEARS before they are making it. https://www.cliffordchance.com/news/news/2022/11/clients--people-and-sustainability-at-the-heart-of-new-london-of.html\n\nBut...back in what seems like 5 years ago but is closer to 20 years ago, one of the biggest law firms in the world had their offices in Canary Wharf. Being such a behomouth of a law firm this one took up many floors. I didn't work there, but I was in the sector at a company that worked with a lot of law firms. I can't honestly remember the exact number I was told, and who knows if it was right then, but let's say they took up 12 floors. 12 floors of a building were all one firm. 2 of those floors were just for IT, no doubt with a large portion of it being server rooms, PC build-up areas, etc, and then a whole lot of IT support, maintenance and development staff. IT in law firms is not seen as the \"real work\" of the firm, but is very important for retaining all the history of documents, being able to show the changes between any stages, and most importantly, churning out a document in 30 seconds and billing the client an hour for it.\n\nThen came Accounts. Someone, somewhere, decided they were spending too much money. So a lot of law-area employees were let go and weren't you paying attention? Of course that didn't happen. They do the \"real work\", they need them. It was ITs budget they decided to throw several hand-grenades into. Some wise, sage-like people decided that IT was taking up too much money and too much space, which took up more money. If they could somehow get rid of IT they could let out those 2 floors they took up and save millions of pounds each and every year. This plan was put to the IT board, who pointed out the glaring issues with this plan and started deep discussions and again you should have been paying attention to the tone of this story. I've no idea how well reviewed it was, because the first I heard about it was when they had already let go of the IT department and let the floors out because their IT was now being handled as a service provided by an Indian company. In India. And no, I don't mean East India that's 1 miles away from Canary Wharf. I mean India.\n\nFloors were let to other companies. IT staff were made redundant. Servers were sold. They committed. And I commented. On hearing about this I believe I said \"That's going to be expensive to put right\". Lawyers are, like every group of people, a mixed bag of personalities. But like almost all groupings of people, some traits are more attracted or suited to the group and therefore tend to represent it. I've met more than one laywer who was not really concerned with IT issues. They just need them gone so they can get on with the \"real work\" of making the firm money. You might be able to imagine dealing with that personality on a support call. They aren't the most forthcoming with details on what they did, or patient with trying to diagnose the cause. A lot of the time the solution is to go to their desk and work it out while they go off and do \"real work\". So let's throw in an accent and many thousands of miles between parties so that over the phone is the ONLY way to deal with issues.\n\nShockingly, no body high-enough up predicted that a Partner at a law firm who has a 50% chance of being over 55 and a 50% chance of being a bit drunk if it's past lunch would have a problem with not being able to summon one of those IT people to their office every time they couldn't work out how to open their new laptop (actually happened). Within a matter of months the project was deemed a disaster that needed to be unwound. I imagine the accountant who signed off on this was allowed to leave too.\n\nThe problem was that the other companies who had moved into their new Canary Wharf offices on the vacant floors just a few months ago weren't keen on moving again (see paragraph 1) and decided they would stay. It turns out that retailers that sell servers and network equipment only sell new equipment too, which comes at the New price, which is higher than the value you get for selling off your second-hand servers. But that wouldn't happen until they had someone with a clue as to what to buy, which meant getting IT staff. I imagine some staff went back, but most would have just started a new job. Meanwhile, this law firm is trying to mass-hire 2 floors worth of IT staff and produce cohesive teams. I can't imagine the mess they were in for months to come.\n\nThe net result of this money saving idea was a lot of upheaval, loss of many experienced staff, a huge IT infrastructure bill, and having to rent out whatever office space they could get that was vaguely close to their office, which I can't imagine they got a great deal on. And, after it was all said and done, the distance between IT and a lawyers desk went from a few floors in a lift with your coffee still in hand, to a 10 minute journey on foot between buildings. And I can bet IT were less forthcoming on desks visits in the winter months.",

I was a field technician in a downtown city back then.\n\nOne day, I was sent to go see this lady that worked at a huge bank. Apparently, she would buy 5 1/4” floppy drives from us and they all would warp in a crescent shape within a few days. And these were Verbatim brand, which was the best brand then.\n\nSo, I show up, and ask her to show them to me. Sure enough, all her opened floppies are warped, nicely stacked on top of each other. Puzzled, I ask her to show me a new box. She opens it and they are perfectly flat. \n\nSo, I ask her to show me what she does when she first uses them. She goes to the storage room, opens a new box, she takes a floppy drive from the box, then takes the labels that come in the box and applies the label to the floppy. But then, she takes the floppy drive, walks over to her typewriter, inserts it into the carriage and begins to type out the label on the floppy!\n\nIt took a lot of me to not start laughing. I could not believe what this lady was doing. After I explained to her what she was doing wrong, she laughed herself and saw her mistake. Floppies and computers were new technology to us all back then.",

        "text": "I used to support a pretty complex database querying and reporting tool for non-profit donor management. It was powerful but quirky and not intuitive, you really had to know what you were doing to make useful things happen. Unfortunately, finances are tight at most non-profits which means unpaid or underpaid (and totally unqualified) people are sitting at the computer trying to make useful things happen.\n\nAs a support analyst, I can fix something broken, explain how a feature works, explain why a feature doesn't work the way a customer thinks it will, direct them to a starting point if totally lost but I cannot (and should not) do the whole job for them. \n\nOne day I get a call from a young woman and she is totally frazzled. She's up against a deadline and doesn't have the first clue as to how this software works. She's not angry (a welcome change) but she's anxious and upset about having this responsibility which is far outside her wheelhouse. I direct her to the features of the software that will accomplish her task and begin to explain that until she is actually running into a problem, that's as far as I can take her. At this point she completely breaks down crying. Between sobs she says that she understands and begins to move the conversation toward ending the call. So now suddenly I feel terrible and realize I can't leave the call like this so in a complete reversal of my prior stance, I ask if it would be helpful for us to go over a few things on a screenshare. Once on the screenshare, I ask what she's trying to report on. I build the query for her and run reports based on our query. I do everything except press the print button. Expressing more relief than I've heard from another human before or since, she thanks me and the conversation ends.\n\nLater that day, she emails my manager directly (must have gotten it from her account rep, don't know how else she would have known who I reported to) and lays out a massive list of terrible things she'd been going through that day and week. She said she isn't sure she could have taken even one more thing and wasn't sure what she would have done had our call not gone differently. That was five years ago, I've never forgotten it and will never forget it. From that point on, I always tried to listen for similar situations but never had any play out quite like that again.",

I worked in a helpdesk role, and was the boots on the ground for a big office. In the office you had any range of employee from a co-op to a partner. One Partner had requested help with a client meeting, no biggie. \n\nI went down early, setup everything, and found him talking to someone on a different level in the office. Mentioned the meeting was good, and he waved me off. A few minutes later, I get notified that the clients are waiting at the elevator to our office (it was locked with covid) and an employee had to go get them, show them to the meeting, and get the partner. I decided to go do this because the partner was still talking, and didn't seem concerned when I let him know. So I let a dozen clients in, got them drinks (bottled water) and got them all seated and left. Some time after the partner did show up, and carried the meeting off no problem. \n\nThe problem was the next meeting the following day. The admin assistant for the partner emailed me telling me I was to do this again, so to setup the meeting, but with the added tasks of waiting for the clients! I was then to get them all (they all don't arrive at the same time) one by one bringing them to the meeting, and helping them with drinks. We then had our usual IT stand up, and I casually mentioned I was being told to be a door greeter. My boss told me to forward him the email, and about 10 minutes later I was cc'd on an email from the assistant. \n\n\"It looks like x can no longer be our door greeter, we'll have to find someone else\" For the record, it was HER job to do all of this, but she was working from home instead of coming in.",

This story is second-hand from a buddy of mine.\n\nNames changed for privacy reasons\n\nRon = My buddy the tech-support-guy \n\nBoss = Boss of Ron\n\nC-IT1 = Customer-side IT guy 1\n\nC-IT2 = Customer-side IT guy 2\n\nC-IT3 = Customer-side IT guy 3\n\nC-IT-DM = Customer-side IT Department-manager\n\nSo lets start it here :\n\nIts a calm monday morning in the headquarters of a Tech-Support company, not many tickets coming in and nothing big going on. Until Rons phone started ringing, a call beeing redirected directly from the boss, usually not a good sign. As soon as he picks up the phone he hears a familiar voice. Its C-IT-DM complaining that their email-server is not working after C-IT1 serviced it on Friday afternoon. Ron takes a quick look in the system and it shows the server as offline, so he askes to be conected to C-IT1 to figure out whats going on and to troubleshoot. First question Ron asked was : *Is the server plugged in and powered on ?* C-IT1 says *yes it is* , and after some more troubleshooting and questions Ron asks C-IT1 to send someone down to the server to check if the server is acctually plugged in and turned on. After some forth and back C-IT1 finaly agrees to sending C-IT2 down to the server to check. A few minutes later the answer comes back from the serverroom and says : *Server is not showing any lights and does nothing when flicking the powerswitch.*  Ron not wanting to go on a 4h driver across country to the customer asks C-IT2 to go back down and check all the cables and then try powering it on again. C-IT2 is already on lunchbreak by know but luckily C-IT3 picks up the phone and though muttering does as asked. After about an hour comes the callback from C-IT3 comes in : *Server still not powering on all cables on the server seem alright.* Well shit . Ron now was told the server was plugged in 3 times and is still not turning on, so he grabs a replacement server and some cables and drives to the customer due to traffic-jams he arrives after about 5h . C-IT-DM greets him at the gate and leads him straight tot he server-room. After 5 seconds of checking the cables Ron notices that yes all cables are plugged into the server but then notices : Wait a second where does the powercable of the server go ?  After carefully moving 2 other servers aside he finds the other end of the cable just loose on the ground. Turns out no one ever bothered to check the other end of the cable. Plugs it in , server is up and running within 5 minutes.   \n \n\nThe aftermath : Pretty high bill for the customer and a pretty mad Ron .  \n So Ron talked to his boss and now they got a new Policy: If they have to drive out to a customer and the issue is something a customer already said they checked an extra charge of 100$ will be applied known within the company as the Idiot-tax maby it will teach them maby it will not. Only the future will show.",

One of our older (read she has been getting social security for a decade) employees by the name of Gloria(made up) is a regular on my google chat because she can't figure out how to submit a ticket (I've taught her several times). Anyway one day she says she has been getting a weird pop-up on one of our application pages. So I go up, and it isn't there so I clean the cache and hope it resolves itself. Two days later, the same thing. Then it goes away.\n\nFinally, after a week, it happens again, so I clear the cache and start to wonder if it is something with the page so I check the code. After sinking an afternoon in the page there was no way for me to recreate the problem. It doesn't help that the only description I have is the page it happens on and \"Well a box pops up with all these words and I can't type\". \n\nAnyway, This goes on for an entire month of me chasing this phantom pop-up. Then one day while I was helping someone else nearby Gloria gets really excited and called me over cause \"It finally showed up\". So I go over to her desk and look at the screen and all I see that's different is the context menu is open, you know what happens when you right-click anything. And so I tell her \"where is the pop up\" and then she said \"That is the pop up\" and pointed to the context menu. \n\n    Me: \"That's the right-click menu, it happens every time you right click\"\n    Gloria: \"Right click?\"\n    M: \"You know, you click things with the left click and you open that menu with right-click\"\n    G: moves mouse to the other side of keyboard \"So I have to use it with my left hand?\"\n    M: feeling like a patronizing jerk. I pick up the mouse and point at each side of the mouse \"Left click clicks on things, right-click opens the menu\"\n    G: \"I don't know that's right I'll just start using my left hand\"\n\nAnd so Gloria uses her left hand to move the mouse around now, and she still works here.",

        "text": "Been lurking for forever, decided to add one of myown tales. Wording is not exact because my memory isn't the best. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm probably bad at writing this as a good story, in the future maybe I'll get some beter tales. \n\nContext:\n\nA few years ago, I did some work at a school, basically just doing all around tech support. \n\nStory:\n\nSo I got a ticket from one of the chemistry teachers for a display that wouldn't connect. The school used screenbeams, basically a remote display device. (Though I personally hate them, they're unreliable and die randomly).\n\nMe: Hey I'm here to look at your screenbeam\n\nTeacher (in thick accent): yes yes the projector isn't working\n\nI made sure the projector input is right, that everything is on, and confirms the \"connect to device\" screen isn't even appearing. \n\nMe: It looks like your screenbeam is broken, I'll run downstairs and grab a replacement. \n\nI went down to the tech office and grabbed a replacement, and imaged it with the same name and password as the old one, then go back upstairs. The password was {4 digits used to identify school}{3 digit room number}{random number}, lets say 6326 220 2\n\nMe: Okay, I'm going to swap out your screenbeam now. \n\nTeacher: It doesn't work anyway, my screen turns off when I connect. \n\nMe, internally: Well shit this'll be interesting. \n\nMe, to the teacher: Well I'll switch out the screenbeam and then I'll take a look at that. \n\nI switched out the screenbeam, basically just needed to unplug power and hdmi from the old one and plug it into the new one. \n\nMe: Okay can you connect to the screenbeam now? \n\nShe opens her laptop and presses the keystrokes to bring up the windows \"connect to display\" menu. (Luckily thats well enough trained into everyone that they remember), and clicks on the old one, it dissapears, and with a little bit of prompting, she manages to click on the right one. \n\nTeacher: Ma'am, what is the password here? \n\nMe: The password is six three two six, *long pause*, two two zero, *long pause*, two\n\nThe teacher then pressed connect, and it connected, and true to her word, the display on her laptop went black, as if it had just transfered to the screenbeam, not using the local display at all. \n\nTeacher: Ma'am the screen is dead, see. \n\nMe: Oh yes it is, can I go change a setting to make it work again?\n\nTeacher: Yes, you know the students always changing settings on my laptop. \n\nMe: *thinking noises* (as the students also had laptops of their own) \n\nI decided to ignore that, and just fix it, and attempted to ask her whether she wanted it set to duplicate or extend. \n\nMe: So do you want the same thing to show up on both? Or do you want to be able to show something different to the students? \n\nTeacher: Can you make it display?\n\nI had to show her both of the options, and she ended up wanting it on duplicate. \n\nTeacher: Thank you you are goddess..... Oh by the way when i draw on the whiteboard, things appear on the doccument. \n\nMe: *blinks* What? \n\nTeacher: If I have something open on the adobe, and I draw here, it appears on the doccument\n\nMe: Ummmmmm okayyyyyy, can you show me? \n\nShe couldn't get it to happen, so I appologized and said if she had it happen again, to open a ticket. Just as I was about to leave I got:\n\nTeacher: Oh Ms. Transorsmth, my printer broken too.\n\nI slowly turned around, figured out where the printer was, and went over to it. There was a paper jam in it, that it looks like someone had tried to fix, but instead ripped off the sheet of paper. Luckily I was able to get an edge of it between 2 fingers and pull it out. The printer screen was still showing an issue, so I pressed buttons til it told me it was out of paper. \n\nI told the teacher that I had fixed it, but was going to get more paper for it, got some and loaded it up, finally the printer fault light went off, and it started spitting out sheets of paper from whatever the last job was. It was some image tiny on a paper, in black and white. I couldn't tell what it was, and because the printer had broken the day before, canceled the job. \n\nMe: Okay I fixed the printer. \n\nTeacher: Thank you you are godsend, okay class everyone thank Ms. Transorsmth. \n\nAbout a quarter of the class actually said it, and they said it out of sync, and I escaped from that room before she could have me fix something else. I brought the dead screenbeam back for disposal, and closed the ticket. \n\nTl;dr: Teacher has several broken things, I fixed. Then I escaped before she could find something else broken.",

        "text": "Early in my career I worked telephone tech support for a small dial-up ISP in rural Michigan. We provided free telephone tech support for our customers. We also provided computer repair services for pretty reasonable prices if someone wanted to bring their PC in.\n\nOccasionally, we would get a non-customer calling for help with their PCs. Strictly speaking, we weren't supposed to provide free support. But if the end user caught one of us in a good mood, we would usually attempt to help them. At least in a limited fashion. And we always had the option of falling back on \"well, we'd really have to see the PC in order to diagnose this further\" to get out of the call.\n\nOne day I had a pleasant sounding older gentleman call in. He was having issues saving a Word document to floppy disk. I told him that this isn't the sort of thing that we would generally help with over the phone. But because he was so pleasant I told him that I was willing to give it a go.\n\nThe info I got from him was that he had a Word doc on a floppy disk. He opened the file and deleted a few words or sentences from the document. Then when he tried to save the file back to the disk, he was getting an error.\n\nAfter a bit of troubleshooting, I determined that the floppy disk was full. Or at least full enough that the document no longer fit on the disk. I explained to him what the issue was and that he would need to delete some files from the disk or simply save the document to a new disk. Keep in mind that this took place during the early 2000s so floppy disks were crazy cheap, think $5 for a 10 pack. So, using a 2nd disk wouldn't break anybody's bank.\n\nThis person was not having my answer. At this point, he was no longer a pleasant sounding gentleman. He first turned stern. He demanded to know how deleting something from a document could possibly make the file bigger. I told him I didn't really know but could only speculate. All I could tell him for certain was that his disk was full, and he needed a new disk. But this answer was not acceptable to him. Now he turned angry.\n\nTo this day, I'm not sure what he thought was going on. But he acted as if I was causing this thing to happen to him. That I was perhaps hiding some secret info from him just to make things difficult? Maybe this was some sort of conspiracy against him? He continued to demand an answer to how this could possibly happen. And I kept repeating that I wasn't sure why the file got bigger and simply using a new, blank, CHEAP disk would solve the problem entirely. But I was getting nowhere with him.\n\nFinally, I explained to him that I wasn't even supposed to provide this sort of support over the phone and had only done it out of the goodness of my heart. And I told him that we'd need to see the floppy disk to do any further troubleshooting. And that this troubleshooting would be billed at $57 an hour. OR, he could buy another 50 cent floppy disk.\n\nAnd that is when I hung up the phone. Fortunately, he didn't call back. Unfortunately (or fortunately, I suppose) he never brought that floppy disk in to get checked out.",

        "text": "I work L1 support for a company, but I do a bunch of the L2 duties because If I just sit there resetting passwords all day I'm just going to fall asleep.\n\nA typical day handling the phone queue is mostly simple IT work like resetting passwords or clearing out registry keys because someone got a temp profile while signing into windows, so something like the following stands out.\n\nI think we'd already gotten a few calls from this guy, every time, we would escalate to another department, because we don't really support \\{EmployeePortal\\} beyond password resets, but that other department is so understaffed that their ticket queue looks like a hurricane went through it. However, he kept calling, we would always point to the same ticket, and let him know what the situation was.\n\nOne day he got particularly angry about how long the issue had been pending. I mean, I don't blame him, but at the same time, his issue was just not being able to apply to an internal position, something that would obviously not be very high in the priority list for a department so small. What we did was we reached out to the absolute warrior over at that department, \\{Luke\\}\n\nNow, \\{Luke\\} did not really have time for this, but we just wanted to give \\{Lord Job\\} some information, and since I already do some of the L2 work, I got to speak with him directly, and explain tbe situation. What I report back to the team is incredible:\n\n\\{Luke\\} tells me that \\{EmployeePortal\\} is not a very well written application, but regardless, the issue was mostly on the user. Turns out \\{Lord Job\\} was a rehire, and when his information was re-entered, his personal info had a typo, it was off by a digit, so when he would enter it to apply to an open position, the system would throw an error as of course, it didn't match.\n\nNow, that was resolved quickly once we told him to contact HR, so we thought we wouldn't hear from him again. But, things aren't like that as you all know, so the day after HR fixed the information, \\{Lord Job\\} called back saying that now he wouldn't get the error, but the page would load for 30 minutes then give ANOTHER error.\n\n\\{Luke\\} must have seen the ticket pop back in his queue and wondered what the hell was going on, since he responded in around two days, something that's unheard of for an issue of this rype. Finally, we get to the title of this post. Turns out, when the application was written, it looks like the developers did not account for someone entering their information, receiving an error, rhen proceeding to attempt another... say, 165 timez?\n\n\\{Lord Job\\} had applied ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SIX times, and \\{EmployeePortal\\} being as fantastic as it is, kept a record each time, regardless of the fact that \\{Lord Job\\} had not technically applied. This time around, since \\{Lord Job\\} had submitted so many applications, the portal would attempt to display all **166** applications, which would cause it to crash on his end.\n\n\\{Luke\\} must have let out a very frustrated sigh, cleared out all that garbage, and then sent the ticket our way to validate with \\{Lord Job\\}\n\nWe give him a call, and he says he was finally able to apply.",

        "text": "I was an administrator on a comprehensive corporate financial system that was also the company's first (and at the time, only - this was very roughly 1990-1995) internal email system. We had a big maintenance+upgrade weekend planned, so starting on Monday we sent out email notices - to *everyone* in the system - warning that the online portion would be shut down early on Friday. (That would allow us to get the weekend batch processing done sooner, leaving more time for the upgrade.)\n\nAn email every morning, Monday through Friday.\n\nAn email early afternoon Thursday.\n\nAn email every hour from 8 AM Friday.\n\nI should mention that when a user first logged onto the system in the morning, they'd immediately get a list of their new emails. (And it was impossible to stay logged in all night - the online system shut down at night.) Also an alert in a designated place on every screen in the system, any time they had a new email when their screen got reloaded or they switched to a different screen.\n\nWe'd warned everyone the system would go down at 3:00.\n\nBeing aware of human foibles, we waited until 3:10, then took down the online system.\n\nAt 3:30 my phone rang. Lady in another division asks \"Why isn't the system up?\"\n\n\"We took it down to prepare for scheduled maintenance and upgrade.\"\n\n\"Well, can you bring it back up? I just have to get this data entered and a weekly report run, today!\"\n\n(For multiple reasons, no. The biggest being that, a particular job having already started, the integrity of the data could not be completely guaranteed until that job and several others finished in a few hours. Less critically, it would have made a mess of the schedule for the upgrade work.)\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I can't help you. We sent out plenty of notices of the early shutdown.\"\n\n\"Oh, I never read those!\"\n\nAt this point I turned rigidly polite and tried to end the conversation as quickly - while being rigidly polite - as I could. Rigidly politely. Did I mention that I was rigidly polite?\n\nAbout 45 minutes later my boss came to talk to me. Wanted to hear my side of that conversation. So I told her.\n\nAnd then she congratulated me on having handled the situation perfectly.\n\nApparently I was *too* polite, and Lady had gone to *her* boss to complain about me. And told him the whole story.\n\nAnd he was... let's say... a bit less polite than I had been. Something about paying attention to internal communications with subject lines such as \"Early shutdown Friday\". Also placing the entire fault for the lady's work not being done on schedule, on *her.*\n\nAnd then called my boss to compliment me for not blowing up at her myself - which it wasn't my place to do.",

        "text": "Context, I work for an outpatient mental healthcare provider, which operates three separate offices in our service area. Also, this occurred on the Tuesday following Thanksgiving weekend. \n\nI was asked provide in-person support to one of our satellite offices today, and also address some physical cabling safety issues as well during the same visit. This is nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nI was also told by there would be network upgrades happening at the satellite office and we should expect some network downtime. Cool thanks for the heads-up. \n\nI arrived at the office this morning and start working on my cabling project.\n\nThe clock hits 11AM and roughly 4 employees come find me in the back room to tell me that their internet isn’t working.  I confirm that network maintenance is happening and unfortunately, there may be inconsistent coverage for the time being.  The users were not happy with this response and as I found out more I didn’t blame them. \n\nI reached out to my coworkers back at our main office conveying the staff’s irritation, and it slowly becomes clear that the following happened in the lead up to this network maintenance.\n\nA clinical manager had been working with our SysAdmin to find an optimal time during which to schedule the network maintenance and downtime. This manager had suggested 11am-2pm on Tuesday because according to the available schedule, no appointments had been arranged in the clinical rooms during this period.\n\nIt evidently did not occur to this woman, that the office would not be closed, and that staff would still be on-site and require the use of our network resources during this period of a f-ing Tuesday, especially so soon after returning from four days off for the Thanksgiving holiday and weekend.\n\nOur SysAdmin took this woman at her word, and made the assumption that she would take it upon herself to inform her staff of the planned network outage. She did not inform her staff ahead of time, and no one on our team in IT had the thought to send a blast email to the affected users to prepare alternative working arrangements. No one had adequate warning or lead time to prepare.\n\nWe, that is to say I was able to provide users with mobile 4G Wi-Fi hotspots to tide them over, until our service was restored around 1PM. Thankfully we haven’t had any other complaints today, but jesus christ it made me so angry. \n\nBoth sides failed our coworkers today and I was sent into a mess waiting to happen.\n\nThis isn’t the worst thing that could have happened but it seems extremely avoidable in hindsight.",

        "text": "Not the actual IWB this time, but the software. Teachers would use this to create lessons as a whiteboard focused/compatible presentation like a powerpoint. A certain feature wasn't working for just two teachers, who just happened to be from one of the most technically astute and vocal teams in the college. They would literally complain for months about a feature that would shave off one click or second per action.\n\nAgain it's been a good few years so details are a little hazy, this is to the best of my memory.\n\nAfter several nonsense calls I get put through to third line support, we have to arrange calls around the teacher and to be able to log in with his account on his office PC so it takes a while to agree times for a session (the supplier being based in canada, me in the UK). We try everything we can think of and are monitoring one particular log file, which for whatever reason was not helpful. Every time we run the faulty tool it crashes out and nothing of use is written to the log. We have a few sessions over a week or so and fail to get any closer. Until one day, the teacher tells me it's all working and thank you. \n\n?????\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Hi, thanks for trying again yesterday. Can I ask, did you realise you'd fixed the issue on our last look?\"\n\n3rdLineSupport: \"What? NO! It's working now?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, I didn't realise either, but the teacher has just called to say it's all good\"\n\n3LS: \"I.. don't know how that could be, but I'm glad it's fixed?\"\n\nMe: \"Well the only thing I can think of is you deleted the log file yesterday and it's started working. We suspect the tool was trying to write to the log file, couldn't, and bombed out. So there was no fault other than a.. non-error unable to be recorded? Deleting the file and allowing it to be recreated by the tool seems to have fixed it\"\n\n3LS: \"I.. ok well thanks very much for the feedback, I'll note it for the future\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI confirmed by doing the same to the other teacher's log file. My manager said something like \"oh yeah... those two would have been the only ones we copied over their profiles during the fileserver migration.. permissions.. should have robocopied.. something something\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3LS and I spoke a few more times. He seemed to be genuinely grateful for useful feedback and not to mind me going to him directly for other issues that were very obviously above helpdesk level fixes. I try not to take things out on product support teams no matter how frustrating it can be, 3LS became a sort of reminder what being civil and reciprical can get you.",

        "text": "Note : \nThese events are based on a true story, but have been tweaked for story telling, dramatic effect and most of all, making sure I can’t be identified. \n\nAt my company, we work with a lot of data. Real thicc data. Exabytes of the stuff. Honestly we have a bit of a problem. I’m pretty sure our execs snort lines of crushed up data instead of just doing cocaine like all the normal millionares. \n\nWhile they’re up in their tower huffing whatever comes out the other end of a 400G network cable, we have to actually figure out how to make sense of the mess. Anyone can collect data. But cleaning it, aggregating it, and turning it into something meaningful is an art. And yes, it is an art. It’s subjective, open to interpretation, and two teams with the exact same group of datasets will produce widely diverging results depending on how they process it. Point is, doing big data right is hard.\n\nPart of doing it right is testing the quality of these enormous datasets and the tooling we build to process it. On this particular day I was setting up a test for uniqueness on one of our larger datasets. We had changed the hash function used to index our records. The test itself was simple - generate a hash based on the data, and compare hashes to make sure no two hashes matched. If we had any duplicate hashes, it would output all the matching hashes along with the original data so I could see if there was a collision or if someone had put a duplicate row into the dataset. Some idiot on the engineering team (me) had been using a dummy hash function while setting up the test harness and forgot to swap it out for the real thing. The dummy code returned a simple XOR of the data with a max entropy of 8 bits. \n\nProduction data was a few billion rows and processing would take a while, so the doofus on the engineering team (me) kicked off the test job on Friday before logging out for the weekend. Sunday night, I started seeing alerts from our monitoring system flooding in. I sent up a quick prayer for both the on-call and whatever poor sod on the engineering team was responsible for the mess (again, me). I thought nothing more of it and ate a nice steak dinner while enjoying the remainder of my weekend.  \n\nOn Monday, I come in to find that everything stopped over the weekend. Virtual machines, network services, serverless compute, databases : all of it went offline. I got to my desk, jumped on a call and began the arduous process of working together with everyone to get my teams’s portion of services back online.\n\nSlowly, details trickle in from Infra with the investigation of the outage. A runaway script had consumed an ungodly amount of compute and storage, and since everything was hosted in the cloud instead of running out of space it just ran up the bill. One of the global billing monitors for the entire subscription had tripped, triggering a shutdown of all services. \n\nAfter we restored services, I got back to my tasks from the previous week. The output file from my job on Friday wasn’t there, even though the job was marked as completed. As I dug into the logs, I saw to my utter astonishment it had written out enough data to give our entire c-suite a contact high off the fumes. Now I was nervous.\n\nA quick review of my code revealed the error. My dummy hash function caused caused the program to erroneously detect nearly everything as duplicate data. It then happily output all the duplicates it thought it saw, which was nearly everything. It did this for each individual record, resulting  in a number of output rows roughly square relative to the input. The final file was roughly 8 petabytes. I’ll leave as an exercise to the reader how much that would cost to store in Azure. All I’ll say is that infra’s automatic billing shutoff was a last-line defense to extreme cost overruns. \n\nThankfully, the fallout was minimal since it was a stupid, but innocent error. As a punishment, I received a slap on the wrist from my manager. My “punitive” task was being made to design and implement changes to our infrastructure so runaway test jobs couldn’t consume endless resources, as well as separating out billing for test and prod. Honestly, my manager’s manager probably had it worst since they had to go to the c-suite and ask for more operations budget. \n\nI’d love to say there was a lesson here, but I can’t find one. We didn’t learn anything new. We just didn’t put up guardrails until someone drove the truck off the proverbial cliff. \n\nIf anything, seeing my boss actually have my back was the biggest lesson here. I know through the grapevine there was a lot of kerfuffle about the extra spending, but I never felt the impact personally.  \n\nTL;DR\nTired monkey make budget go boom.",

        "text": "This was shortly after I started working at the bar for smart people.  I was having a pretty good time, I very much prefer fixing things and at this time the attitude was more about doing that than about hawking more phones at people.  My next appointment was ready, and the customer was coming up, a tall, older man with something wrapped in a trash bag, cradled in his arms.\n\nHe unfurled the bag, and pulled from it, another bag.  Then he unfurled that bag, and in a ziploc was an ipad with a hole in it.  He set the ziploc'd device down on the bar and explained to me what happened.\n\nHe had been trying to get an email password reset but, at least if I understood right, genuinely got caught in a dumb loop of things because he once had a different authentication method he no longer knew.  As he was experiencing that the iPad itself started to behave strangely - some garbled graphics, unresponsive screen, turned black and came back, seemed like it was having a pretty rough time.\n\nBy this point he was so frustrated, he walked outside with the iPad and his pistol, and shot it.  To \"put it out of its misery\".  He was there to see if it was possible to do an exchange because it was still in warranty.\n\nNow, this left me in a pretty conflicted position.  On the one hand, no, shooting your iPad is not covered by the warranty.  On the other, the guy shot his iPad because he was frustrated.  Didn't seem like a great idea to do something frustrating in that moment.   I decided on a compromise:  I would ask my manager.\n\nI took the bagged iPad to the back, and approached my manager.  She looked at the bag, looked at me, and then looked back at the bag.  \n\n\"Did he?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And he expects us to-\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\nI waited a bit, so folks could look at it.\n\nThen I went back out front, set the bag down at the bar and calmly told the man there wasn't a way for us to make a warranty claim work.  I did my best to frame it in a very particular way - we totally tried to see whatever loophole could let us but there just wasn't a way around the fact this was deliberate damage, which meant we could not accept it for an exchange.  He'd have to buy a new one if he wanted one.\n\nThe man smiled and shook his head.  \"Yeah,\" he said, sighing, \"I kinda figured.  Dunno till you take the shot though, gotta at least try and see.\"  He took the bag and asked what he could do with it.  I said there was a place down the road that recycles electronics, they might not take it in person but there was a drop-off box around the side nobody hangs around.  He said he appreciated the help and offered a handshake.\n\nI shook his hand and when I did I felt something.  He did an awkward motion with his fingers, making sure that something stayed in my hand.  As he turned and walked out, I saw I was $50 richer and put it in my wallet.",

        "text": "Good evening everybody! I wasn’t sure if this should go on this sub or r/talesfromretail, however since there is a bit of “technical support” I figured it would be a good fit. I used to work at a now non-existent office supply location. It was in a small town that was, (and still is) becoming a mini California in terms of a richer population and rising real estate costs. With that, brought in floods of very rich people, expecting tech items that literally did not exist in our city, or sometimes even our state.  If I come across as a jerk in these stories, please understand that I had a rule with customers. I will always tolerate 2 transgressions towards me. I understand people can be upset and I try to help them. But if they did three strikes I got very blunt with them. \n\nThe extent of our tech inventory was printers, laptops, desktops, two tablets and a small software section. No pc parts, gaming pc's, or anything fancy. I thought I’d include some short stories of some of the weirdest and worst customers I had.  \n\nSettle in, cause I’ve got a lot of stories.  \n\n1) The first was on a Black Friday. No customers for the first two hours. Finally, somebody pulls in. Says there mother need a printer compatible with Windows 95. Even some pretty new Brother printers have compatibility with windows 98, but not beyond that. I told him, literally the only option I had left was a 400 dollar dot matrix printer on our website. He thought I was joking. I told him he wasn’t, and his best chance was getting one from a thrift shop and hoping a cleaning kit might fix it up. He was so upset that he threw two of our printers on the ground.\n\n2) I probably saw this one at minimum, 2 or 3 times a day. Older client comes in. Wants a USB cable. “What are you trying to connect?” I ask. “Doesn’t matter.” They always replied. I always had to go into an FBI mental analysis mode with them just to find out they need a printer cable. When I had them a Type-A to Type-B (Standard printer cable), they would argue that it wasn’t right. Always fun handing them a serial or parallel USB adapter, and telling them that unless the printer was as old as I was, it’s not the last two. Never, not once was I wrong, but even with the printers they bought in store and could physically show them the connection, they would still act like we were trying to deceive them.\n\n3) Guy comes in looking for Apple product. I told him sorry, there is only two places in town that still sell Macs and they are both closed till the next day. He was adamant that we sold Mac’s and didn’t like it when I told him, “We Did. Stopped about 15 years ago”, he immediate started saying Mac was the best product ever but absolutely acted unhinged. Went off on me and said “What makes you the expert on Macs then?”, I responded with, “well, I used to work for them\".  He left, very quiet.  \n\n4) Lots of customers came in wanting free data erasing. Said I had two options. Secure data wipe for 50 dollars a hard drive, followed up by a complete dismantle. Other option was I’d offer to compact it for free but have them sign a waiver. The amount of doctor offices that would yell that it should be free is terrifying, and more often then not I would see them smashing hard drives outside our store.\n\n5) Lots of people still wanting Firewire devices. I understand that music devices still have it but the amount of upset customers over the non existent Firewire devices was absolutely stunning.\n\n6) Customer absolutely furious that we didn’t sell PC parts in store. Only 1 store in the entire town had anything, and that was at a 300-400% markup. Got more upset when I said the only part we had in store was a DDR2 SODIMM (I think maybe a 1 gig stick). This was in 2020.  \n\nThis is my first big text post, so if you guys want more, please let me know!",

We had a spare card, but there was a problem: the case was locked and nobody knew where the key was.\n\nWe wouldn't normally think this would be a problem, because PowerEdges of the era only had four different numbered keys that unlocked them and we had a coffee mug full of them in the office. (I don't recall which number was which so made them up here) We needed an 03; we had about a dozen 01s, a handful of 02s, and a couple of 04s. But not a single 03.\n\nI asked around a couple of other departments if anyone had an 03 PowerEdge key lying around; nobody did. Asked a bit more organisation-widely, still no luck.\n\nWe could no doubt have asked Dell to help and waited a day or three for them to show up and paid them some $$$. But the complaints from the outage were getting more frequent, and it was out of warranty anyway. So I collected the biggest flat-blade screwdriver I could find, an adjustable wrench, and a hammer. Presented the items to the boss and his eyebrows slightly bounced off the ceiling, but he did approve my proposal for server violence.\n\nI headed back to the problematic server. Shut it down, then shoved the screwdriver into the lock, gave the end a couple of good whacks with the hammer, then stuck the wrench onto the screwdriver handle and gave it a good twist.\n\nReplacing the NIC was a bit anti-climactic after that ...",

It's possible I got the log through some sort of \"save log\" option through the software, or I could just be stoopid and had not picked up on it until later. I do think grabbing it from the file location was suggested as an alternative way to get it but my memory isn't 100%.

The calls I got made me weep for humanity. After my son was born, I decided not to return from maternity leave. I just couldn't handle staying up all night with a screaming newborn, and then coming in to work and calmly asking people how the hell they can't see the huge red \"CREATE AN ACCOUNT\" button smack-dab in the middle of the page, but they can find our phone number in tiny font up in the corner to call and demand that we do it for them.\n\nWell, you guys, my baby is now a toddler, and I just had that misty-eyed, hand-on-heart, proud parent moment that you always hear about. My son was playing with his Brilliant Baby Laptop, which is basically a bright plastic clamshell that plays music when the baby mashes the keyboard. Suddenly, the music stopped. The baby was confused. Further button-mashing had no effect. I watched from the sofa as my son frowned, experimentally smashing the buttons harder. Then, as I looked on in amazement and pride, he turned it off and on again. \"Welcome!\" It announced, the screen lighting up in a joyful display. My son contentedly returned to his button-mashing, and I shed a proud tear. So what if your kid can say \"mommy\" and \"daddy\" and knows how to use a spoon? Mine can troubleshoot!",

The long summer holiday is the juicy bit of the year. Six weeks of generally uninterrupted time for projects, things normally done after hours, and a really good dig into the shiny and new. One year I'm asked to investigate options for classroom management software, the type that does student-teacher screensharing and features like capturing prohibited words and reporting on NSFW content. I evaluate three candidates. And by that I mean I tried to break it in any way possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCandidate One was a non starter. It wanted a port opening in the firewall on the teacher PC \"server\" for each student PC \"client\" to create it's own session. ITManager says no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCandidate Two doesn't get far.\n\nMe: \"Hi, so I installed the trial and I notice it's only picking up the local VLAN network clients and I'm a bit surprised to see \"My Network Neighbourhood\" here?\"\n\nCandidateTwoSupport, far too eagerly: \"Yes! It uses NetBIOS!\"\n\nMe: \"I see..\"\n\nCandidateTwoSales calls a little while later.\n\nCandidateTwoSales: \"Hi!, So did you have a chance to look at it?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes I'm afraid we won't be going forward with this product\"\n\nCandidateTwoSales: \"Oh I see. Is there any particular reason why?\"\n\nMe: \"Well I spoke to your support team and they confirmed the technology this uses was deprecated in Server 2008. We run 2012 R2. It's not something we'd be looking to install on our network\"\n\nCandidateTwoSales isn't techy, but he takes in what I say and understands. The change in his tone of voice makes me think he's actually understood one aspect very well. He might want to start brushing up his CV.\n\nITManager says no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCandidate Three looks much more promising. At First. Parts of it are actually quite interesting, the word filter has a built in dictionary to browse with explanations for each prohibited word or phrase, so I learn a little about the darker side of modern slang terms and global political history. There are a few gripes I have with it but one stuck out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCandidateThreeSupport: \"Thanks so much for your feedback, I just wanted to clarify a few of your comments\"\n\nMe: \"Sure, which ones?\"\n\nCandidateThreeSupport: \"This part here about regex, we don't support that\"\n\nMe: \"I thought I saw in your documentation some reference to regex?\"\n\nCandidateThreeSupport: \"We used to support it, but it was removed\"\n\nMe: \"Ah. That would explain it then\"\n\nCandidateThreeSupport: \"What's that?\"\n\nMe: \"Well I noticed it would block web pages or text containing certain terms\"\n\nCandidateThreeSupport: \"Yes that's the content filter\"\n\nMe: \"Yes I understand, but these were the terms September 11th or July 7th\" \n\nCandidateThreeSupport: \"Yes they would trigger the filter\"\n\nMe: \"Without further context? It's just a flat text match?\"\n\nCandidateThreeSupport: \"That's right\"\n\nMe: \"So any news article or anything online that has the date it was published in it will get the whole site blocked twice a year?

I need a bit of a reality check because I really don't feel that I've done anything inspirational or product roadmap changing. I tell the story to ITManager with an am I missing something face? He replies with his own no they're just idiots face.\n\nITManager says no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote to say, memory is hazy on some of this, I think it was NetBIOS but I've never done anything with it other than disable it when asked to.",

        "text": "About a year a half ago I was working for one of the largest telecom companies in Sweden as a customer service representative. Our company sold mobile phones, phone plans, wireless routers and broadbands. \n\nOne day I received a call from an older man, I don't exactly remember how old he was. Around 60, I think. The first thing he said after hello was \"It's not working.\"\n\n\"What isn't working\", I asked.\n\n\"The TV.\"\n\nI said I was sorry to hear that and then tried to explain that we didn't sell TV's, nor did we provide cable or other TV-channels. I couldn't help him with his issue and he should call his other provider.\n\n\"What other provider\", he asked. I said that we provided his phone plan and his Wifi and I could help him if there was an issue with those, but I wasn't trained to deal with TV's or TV-plans. I listed a few of the most common providers for that and said that maybe one of those was his provider. This is where he got mad.\n\nHe yelled that he didn't have time to spend all day on the phone, that he had been waiting a really long time (like 20 min, so that wasn't true) to talk to me and that I'd better help him. \n\n\"I can't\", I tried to say. \n\n\"But what about Netflix\", he suddenly said.\n\nI asked what he meant and he said that, that he couldn't use it. I don't know if there was a problem with the app on his TV, or if he just hadn't logged in. Anyway, since Netflix does need wifi to work and I really didn't want to talk to this guy anymore, I decided that we should reset his router. If it really was an issue with wifi connection and he only wanted to watch Netflix, this would solve his problem after all. (At least after he had re-logged onto his wifi on the TV).\n\nIt took ten minutes to convince him that resetting the router wasn't the same as restarting it and another five to get him to actually do it. I then said that it would now need a few minutes to reconnect, but should be fine after that. Then I added that if it wasn't fine, he could call back and then I quickly hung up. If he called back he luckily got through to someone else.",

        "text": "I used to work at a vending/arcade company that placed machines in restaurants, stores, and also rented out machines for events, parties and such.\n\nThe machines in the warehouse that were found to be in working order had a masking tape label saying \"Good: (date)\" so we would know when it was last tested. If there was a problem, a label or sign describing the problem and/or what part(s) were needed would be on it instead. \n\nOne day, I noticed a bartop touchscreen game that had no signage on it, so it was probably picked up recently for one reason or another, but not tested yet. We didn't deal with gambling machines, this had card, puzzle and action games just for fun. These were mostly found in bars.\n\nI plugged in the machine, and went through the list of games. Well, based on that, I could tell the touch screen was dead on. There was no stuttering when scrolling through the menu, or any other sign of the computer having trouble or the software becoming corrupt. No lines on the screen, maybe it was a little dim but the adjustments might help. Indeed they did, it looked a bit better. \n\nThere were quite a few games on this machine. I started one of it's generic asteroid shooting games and, after poking around for a few seconds to make sure the touchscreen responded well enough, let the game end. It didn't freeze up. \n\nI wasn't sure of the other games, but within the bowels of the \"operator menus\" (the ones opened by either a keyswitch or a button behind a locked coin door) I found an option that said \"hard drive test\". This sounded like a good idea, certainly when the alternative was play-testing every game on the machine one by one (which I didn't think the boss would approve of, for reasons that should be obvious :) ) or putting it back out in the field without being sure that it would keep running for long enough. \n\nI tapped the \"start hard drive test\" button and confirmed the confirmation dialog box that popped up, and a progress bar appeared. I went on to check, clean and fix other machines in the warehouse while this was going on.\n\nLater on, I glanced over at the touchscreen machine and noticed it had gone blank. Upon closer inspection, the screen was still on: I could still see the raster/light that most screens have when they're turned on, even when they're showing black. I tried the internal menu button (or was it a key switch?) and tried tapping on the screen, but it looked like no one was home. Weird. Well, not knowing what the machine was supposed to do at the end of the hard drive test, I'm not sure if it was supposed to shut down when it was done. This would be odd, though, as it lacked a \"software power button\" that modern computers have. So, I unplugged the machine, waited for 10 seconds and plugged it back in.\n\nI got the ominous \"Disk error: Press any key to restart\" text on a black background. Obviously, pressing a key is quite impossible on a touchscreen machine that lacks any physical buttons! Tapping the screen did nothing. Coin return button? Nope. Menu switch? Well, it went blank for a few seconds, apparently trying again, but the same error showed back up.\n\nWell, that can't be good. I unplugged it and waited 30 seconds this time. I plugged it back in, and sure enough, it still said \"Disk error: Press any key to restart\"\n\nYep, the built-in test somehow bricked the hard drive. It didn't overheat or anything: the fan was definitely working when I started the machine up. I had learned to always check that any cooling fans were working before allowing a machine to stay on. I'm not really sure how one would even get another copy of the machine's software in a case like this. Hopefully the manufacturer of the machine would sell you a pre-imaged hard drive as a repair part (even if it were marked up 10 ways to Sunday) \n\nI just marked it as having a \"corrupted or bad HD\" but I didn't detail how it got to that point, for fear of being somehow blamed for using the built-in test. Thankfully, that didn't happen. Unfortunately, they needed people who were also really good at moving arcade/vending machines around for events, and I didn't make the cut on that front, so I was let go from the company after a relatively short stint there. However, I saw the inside of many more arcade machines than I ever realistically would have otherwise.\n\nTL;DR: Thank you for pressing the self destruct button. This machine will self destruct in exactly 20 minutes.",

        "text": "I've heard variations of this bandied around and usually dismissed as an urban legend, so I thought I would share my own experience. First, a little background - I hail from Africa. A sub-saharan ragion, to be more specific - beautiful, hot, dry and dusty, and with interesting wildlife (you never forget your first hippo wandering down the main street in a busy city).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was working as the combined warranty/1st/2nd engineer for a good-size IT wholesaler, so as you can imagine my days were busy. One of the common things was people complaining their computers were running slow and shutting down at random, if they even powered up (sparks &amp; smoke were not unheard of as PSUs clogged up). This was genrally due to being big beige Pentium 60 boxes with dinky  coolers, sitting for months under desks and sucking in all the dirt, fluff and crud that blew in on the breeze - windows and doors being permanently open to cool things down in the building. I'd unplug the offending box, park it by the back door &amp; point my heavy duty blower at it - this usually blew out enough dirt that the thing looked like it was undergoing a test launch for NASA, but after 10-20 seconds it would be shiny and fresh and run like a dream. \n\nSo when I got the call on a morning, I thought nothing of it and went off to do the usual. The first thing I noticed as I approached the desk was a rather tatsy cooking smell. Early for a braai, thought I, but on the other hand you can't beat some fresh fire-grilled delights for a good start to the day, so more power to them. Except - the smell got stronger as I got to the desk and away from the windows.\n\nHmm...\n\nStill, the PC was showing all the classic signs of a fluff-heating victim - powered off instantly, sparked a little, hot to the touch), so I unplugged it and trundled off to my well-hidden lair. Well-hidden due to the management having a  strong desire to keep their resident technological troglodyte out of the customer's eye &amp; their own peaceful domains, if at all possible, but that is a different tale. \n\nPulled the case off the thing and wow did that fresh-grilled meat aroma fill the room. Smelled like chicken, but anyways. That was the first thing I noticed, as I wrangled the heavy steel case with it's dozen screws and manufacturer's clips that were the bastard offspring of duct tape, superglue and a crocodile off the frame. \n\nThe *second* thing was the snake head facing me, jaws open, teeth glinting and quite unexpected. After a (perfectly manly) yelp and an impressive rearward leap out the door (opening of which was acheived on the fly, as it were) I begin to notice some fine details - to whit, it appeared quite dead judging by the loose tounge and the fact it was smoking gently, and only about an inch of the body behind the head was visible, with the rest somewhere in the PSU. The poor thing was only a young brown house snake - quite harmless, and quite friendly. A lot of houses actually tried to persuade them to move in as they did wonders for rodent problems.   \n\nYou see, what happens is that snakes, being cold blooded, like somewhere warm of a night to nap. A toasty hot computer plinking as it cools down in an empty office of an evening is evidently something that will fit the bill, and the only entry route they can fit through, if they can at all, is the fan/s on the PSU. In later times I found a few more that were quite unharmed, if a little annoyed - snake scales apparently being something of a good improptu insulator, and the fans not being strong enough to do more than bonk them on the nose and irritate it - but on occasion they would touch the wrong components as they curled up for a nap. Come the morning, well, zap goes the snake and ring goes the techie's phone. \n\nSo while I cannot lay claim to the veracity of every iteration of this old tale, I can confirm for all and sundry that I have seen with my own eyes snakes in the box, just waiting for an unwary techie to drop by and say hello.",

He is one of those people who is proud of his knowledge and knowing a bit about everything. I respect that. So he shows me around his entire house, where his modem and router is, the hardline ethernet cable down to his office. He then brings me to his office and shows me the computer and printer\n\nAs I typically do I ask him to show me what he does to print a document. Want to make sure this is a printer issue and not user error. He opens a word document, then goes file, then print. Selects the right printer, which shows as online, but here he reassures me that it has always shown as online. He presses the final print button and hovers the mouse over the bottom right saying that the error always pops up right about now. \n\nThe only issue (or I guess lack of issue)? It prints completely fine after the printer does that typical 5 second warmup thing. Note here that I haven't touched any of his tech or even suggested anything beyond asking him to show me his process. \n\nHe insists on paying me 20 bucks. He will not take no for an answer and likely would have given it to my mom if I had absolutely refused. Overall 10/10 would do again.",

        "text": "I think everyone that works in IT has had at least one encounter where a user comes rolls up with a solution instead of a problem.  I had such an encounter a few months ago.\n\nOne of our departments had a new joiner and they needed a piece of software installed on the joiner's computer.  We looked through our software catalogue, but couldn't find it.  But, when we checked our inventory tool, we found that everyone in their department had it installed.  I put it down to poor documentation, installed the program, confirmed it ran, and left it at that.\n\nA few days later, I'm asked what the license key is.  Bugger.  I look through our shared mailbox and cannot find any references to this product or vendor.  I check our licenses folder and turn up nothing.  I check the with the team making the request to find out when previous licenses were purchased, check it against the department's budget for the periods when the licenses had been bought in the past, and discover we never purchased the licenses.\n\nAfter some more digging, I find out that the license cost is CHF 125 per user, they've been purchased on the old manager's company credit card, the new manager does not have a company credit card, the current licenses they have are for an older version of the application, they previously licensed a user that no longer works for the company, their old license cannot be transferred to the current version, and we cannot find an installer for the version they currently have.  I reach out to the vendor's support for an old installer and, as expected, they told us to upgrade.\n\nSome arguments ensue as to who should be responsible for buying the new license.  I say it shouldn't be us, my manager concurs, their manager doens't want the cost on their cost centre, and this new joiner is sat there twiddling their thumbs one day a week because they need this software to complete their tasks.\n\nSo I take a step back and figure out what this program acutally does and what it is used for.\n\nIt actually seems like a pretty cool application.  You enter a path, enter some keywords or serach terms, apply some filters (create date, last modified, file type, etc.), and it will return all files that staisfy those terms, identifying duplicates, highlighting the similarities or differences between files, etc.  I ran it on our department's contracts folder and was able to find the invoice for a storage array we had purchased seven years prior, but hadn't been able to find the invoice for, which was preventing us from selling it to a reseller.\n\nBut why did they need the program?\n\nEvery day, a series of reports come in from various locations.  These reports are dumped into a single folder.  The file names are randomly generated.  Sometimes, 2 or 3 reports can come in between them checking the folder, but they only need the latest report.  Sometimes reports are accidentally sent with no data in them, so these need to be discarded.  They periodically need to find the latest report for a specific location and then email it to another team in another country.  Different people on the team are responsible for different locations, hence why all the team need this program.\n\nSo the team will open the program, enter the path of the folder containing all the reports, search for the location code, and then click 'go'.  They then drag the latest report into the folder for that location.\n\nIt took about 5 minutes to understand the above process.\n\nI took a look into the contents of the report and saw that it's basically a CSV with a strange file extension.  The first row is a header, containing the names for each column.  The third column is the location code, which always follows one of the same formats:\n\n    [number][letter][number][number]\n    [number][letter][letter][number]\n    [number][letter][letter][letter]\n    [number][letter][number][letter]\n\nWithin 15 minutes, I've written and tested a PowerShell script that will scan through all the files in the folder, use regex on the second line to extract the location code, copy the file to a new folder renaming it to the location code and the date the report was generated (plus an auto-incrementing number on the end if there are more than one from the same day), and then adding the original file to a text file to prevent the same file from being checked twice.\n\nThe script was placed on a task server and scheduled to run every 15 minutes.\n\nThis meant the team could now go into this new folder, use Windows Search to find the location code, and then read the date in the file name to identify the latest report.  It took about 5 minutes to train the team on the new process.  And then, upon realising that the team they forward these reports to could perform the task just as easily, it took another 5 minutes to change the path the renamed reports are saved to, and train the second team on their new process.\n\nThey'd been using this process for around five years.  It took them around 3 hours a week to complete.  They'd purchased four licenses for the tool so far at around CHF 125.  Estimating their hourly rate at CHF 30, their cost to date would have been:\n\n    30 x 3 x 52 x 5 = 23,400\n            125 x 4 =    500\n                      ------\n                      23,900 CHF\n                     ~24,200 EUR\n                     ~25,040 USD\n\nObviously, inflation, exchange rates, discount rate, etc. would alter this figure.  But my hourly rate is around CHF 41 an hour.  I spent probably an hour trying to implement their solution, 5 minutes understanding their problem, and 25 minutes implementing and training them on my solution, a solution that eliminated one team's need to do any work at all on this particular task.  That's 90 minutes, costing CHF 61.50, which is a minute fraction of the cost of the solution they came up with 5 years earlier.\n\nIn short, when you have a problem, come to IT, don't try to figure it out yourself.",

        "text": " I dont post alot of tales but after a conversation with a co-worker she suggested i MUST share this tale.  \n\n\nPicture IT.  \n\n\nIts 2010. \n\nIm a Network Admin at a financial institution. We were looking to move to VOIP from an OLD and i mean old PBX system. I had some VOIP experience so guess who they asked from IT to get this started. Easy guess , me.\n\n  \nWe went through a few vendors and a few demos and after a couple of months and a little coaxing we went with the Cisco solution. Fast forward we implement the solution and after a few late nights and long days all is well. I maintain the system on the network side and since i have previous experience with VOIP i learn as much as i can when comes to CUCM and UCCX (Keep UCCX in mind). Over years i take various training classes and overall be become pretty proficient in all things CUCM and UCCX. I also develop some pretty good contacts that i can lean on within Cisco for help with anything i may need some some assistance on. Keep in mind these contacts are outside of Cisco TAC.\n\n  \nFast forward a few years and a new VP of the Dept the Contact Center is in is assigned to head up the dept. He goes over some of the reporting and does not like the numbers. I just heard this via hearsay. My thinking is \"I guess some changes may need to be made personell wise to achieve the numbers you want\". Mind you i just said this in my head, i never expressed this to anyone. It was just a thought. A couple of weeks go by and i get a call asking to attend a meeting later that day. No big deal i get to the conference room and its the VP of the Contact Center, and the Contact Center supervisors. We all exchange pleasantries and they get to meat of why they asked me here.\n\n  \nVP - \"We been looking at these reporting numbers and we don't think that they are right\"  \n\n\nMe - \" What do you think is off with the numbers\"  \n\n\nVP - \"Call Center Supervisor #1, can you explain further?\"  \n\n\nCall Center Supervisor #1 - \"These numbers are all off. We think some of these people had to be taking more calls than this. Something must be wrong with the system  \n\n\nMe - \"Let me know exactly what report you are running and i'll look into it.\"  \n\n\nThey send me the name of the report and off i go into report land. The land of pulling numbers from a database and checking on its accuracy. After a couple of days of trouble shooting i'm really not seeing anything wrong. I note my findings via email and don't hear anything back. I'm thinking the matter is closed but little do i know in an exective meeting its being told that the numbers are \"way off\" and LongIsland is wrong and does not have a clue. The system is wrong.\"  \n\n\nNow i have no problem being wrong but in this case the data is the data. Just because you don't like whats in the report doesn't mean I or the report is wrong. Time to step this up a notch. I decided to get on the phone with a few of my contacts at Cisco. I sent them over the reports and we performed a quick webex and determined the reports were indeed legit and made sure i had their verification in Email. I scheduled a meeting with the Cisco Contacts, Contact Center VP, Supervisors and my VP to go over the findings and the meeting sort of went like this.  \nAfter exchanging introductions.  \n\n\nCisco Contact - \"So heard you are having some issues with numbers generated on this particular report.\"  \n\n\nContact Center VP - \"Yeah these number are way off, they cannot be right. We think there is issue with the system.\"  \n\n\nCisco Contact - LongIsland and i went over the system and the numbers thoroughly and i really dont see any issues. Usually in cases like this the customer wants the numbers to reflect what they feel they should reflect. The numbers pulled from the database are just that. They cannot be manipulated in any way. Usually when they don't produce the results you want that is a personell issue not a data issue. We do have a few consultants that can help you acheive the numbers you are trying to attain. if you like i can reach out to them on your behalf.\"  \n\n\nSilence  \n\n\nMe - I guess we will have to take this offline. Thanks for your help Cisco Contact.  \n\n\nAnd that was that. It was hard to keep that shit eating grin off my face and my VP knew it. I never heard about any issues with UCCX reports again. The phone menu is a diffrent matter, but that is for another time.",

        "text": "Several days later, someone else had untangled the string on the claw and put it back in place. They also glued a washer over the broken end of the pulley. The string couldn't slip off anymore, but may still catch on the remaining broken part from time to time. I suppose that will have to do until a replacement part was obtained. The boss knew what it needed so if he wanted me to order it myself, I figured he would say so.\n\nYou may remember that I mentioned a missing ground prong on the plug. I included that in the email to my boss about the claw machine. We didn't originally get the machine like that, it broke off in an outlet while it was at our store. We didn't have any replacement plugs OR cords that I knew of, but in this disorganized mess of a store, who could say? \n\nA couple weeks later, on a day where the boss wasn't there, a customer complained that the claw machine shocked him. I described what an electric shock from AC felt like and asked if it felt like that, or more like a static shock. He said it felt like AC was present. So I asked him to, without touching the machine, point to what shocked him. He pointed to the metal box where the joystick and coin slots were. I told him, thanks. He left the store without another word. \n\nI grabbed my little voltage detector pen, and turned it on, testing it on a known-live outlet before I \"trusted\" it. I poked the metal box with it. The pen lit up and beeped. Ruh roh. I then poked the metal decorative trim that ran up the corners/edges, which surrounded the decorative \"rope lights\" or \"strip lights\". This too was live. Yikes! Even the metal frame of the front door was live, with 110 VAC.\n\nThis needed to be unplugged, IMMEDIATELY, and not hooked back up until it was repaired. The trouble was moving the machine back so I could remove the plug without touching either 1: The metal trim up the corners, 2: the coin/controller box, or 3: The metal frame of the front door. I didn't have any insulated gloves, and even if I did, I was wearing a short sleeved shirt and didn't have a coat to cover my arms, due to the weather that day. I asked my coworker if he knew which breaker controlled that set of outlets where the claw machine was. He said he didn't know. I told him that he should shut down the computer, because it might lose power. He asked why, and I explained the claw machine was shocking people, and I couldn't reach the plug without touching the machine, so I needed to find the breaker, and that might mean the computer would lose power. He said he needed the computer to stay on. I literally facepalmed right in front of him, and said \"I don't think you understand, there is high voltage on the outside of the machine. The outside that people can touch. That means someone could get electrocuted, and we would get sued. That could put us out of business, which means we would all lose our jobs. No one's lives are depending on that computer right now, nor is our business.\"\n\nWith that, I went to the breaker room and took a few guesses. I went back out to the floor, and I had indeed shut off the outlet cluster that fed the claw machine. I pulled the machine away from the wall and unplugged it. I opened up the back cover and removed the fuse, putting a big DANGER note covering the fuse slot. This was inside the machine. Since the machine was on wheels, I went ahead and wheeled it to the back room, and then I turned the breakers back on. \n\nI called the boss and left a message explaining why the claw machine had been moved to the back room. \n\nI took the cord and tried using a continuity checker to zero in on the source of the problem. I measured between the hot prong and the metal parts on the outside, but the checker didn't beep or light up. I figured if it did, I could disconnect parts of the machine one by one until I found where the short was. Unfortunately, the continuity checker isn't seeing it, so it's probably a case of slight leakage from something rather than a dead short. So I armed myself with the multimeter and voltage detector pen from before. \n\nI went through a similar process that I'd originally planned, but with the ohms setting on my meter. I measure between the hot prong and the metal trim on the machine. It should either be open or at least in the mega-ohms, but it's lower resistance than that. Not a dead short, though, so it probably isn't an actual frayed wire touching the inside of one of the metal parts. So I disconnected one light fixture inside the machine, but the leakage was still there. I disconnected another light fixture, the leakage was still there. I disconnected the power supply... bingo! There was leakage between Hot and Ground on the power supply. \n\nThe ground strap is supposed to be connected to the inside of all user-accessible metal trim, so that if a hot wire touches it from inside, it shorts out and blows a fuse/breaker. However, with the third prong missing on the plug, the ground strap instead carried the fault current from the power supply to all the outside metal parts of the machine. I reconnected the lights, but left the power supply box disconnected. The power supply was 24V for the motors and 5V for the control board. Great, that shouldn't be hard to find. I labeled the wires for the power supply outputs so we'd know where the wires were supposed to go on the new power supply when we got one. \n\nWe lacked any ticketing or record keeping system for repairs of machines that belonged to us, so I just wrote on a blank piece of paper that the machine needed a new 24V/5V power supply, and a new cord or plug (The missing ground prong was the reason the machine became live on the outside. With a ground prong, the fuse would have simply blown instead, or lower current leakage would just harmlessly go to ground) \n\nI worked on some other machines, did some cleaning and busy work until closing time and went home for the day. \n\nThe next day, I see the claw machine back out on the floor already. Given that both of my coworkers had a track record of disregard for electrical safety, I had little doubt it was still a shock risk. Indeed, I grabbed my voltage detector pen, poked the metal coin door with it, and found that it was live, again! They had hooked the same power supply back up again, and didn't replace the plug! If they had done *either* the machine wouldn't be live! But where did they get another fuse? I pulled out the original, and we didn't have any in stock as far as I knew. Unless.... You guessed it, they bypassed the fuse to get the machine running again, effectively going for double Jeopardy: Now you can get shocked AND burn the store down! Of course, what else are claw machines for?\n\nI called my boss and, since he of course didn't pick up, I basically left a message saying that someone else had undone all my safety measures and put the machine back out on the floor, still unrepaired, still a shock hazard to customers who simply wanted to play the machine. This time, the machine was in a different position and I was able to safely reach the plug without pulling the breaker first. \n\nI honestly can't imagine how the idiot managed to plug it in without touching the metal parts, which would have immediately clued him in that neither I nor the customer were joking when we said it was shocking people. \n\nNow you're all saying \"cut the plug off\" and yes, in hindsight I probably could have done that. However, I figured the boss might consider that destruction of the store's property (even though that would be the first step to putting a new plug on the end of the cord) which is why I didn't do that. That said, I had pretty much run out of any other options that didn't involve physical violence. \n\nAfter unplugging the machine, I disconnected the power supply from the inside, then plugged it back in so the lights would be on, therefore my idiot coworkers would be none the wiser until/unless they actually tried to play it, or looked at the little LED screen that was supposed to show the credits and time. \n\nTo be clear, the machine was now technically safe to touch for people. It just wouldn't work with the power supply disconnected, but it wouldn't shock people either.\n\nWhoever pulled it back out was clearly fixated on having a claw machine out on the floor. Therefore, I decided to look and see if we had a power cord and power supply from another machine so we could have the claw machine working again. \n\nI asked my coworkers if they knew of any machines that we could use for parts. They both said no. I asked if they knew of anything else that used a 24V supply. They had no idea. Well, thanks for nothing, I guess.\n\nThis was the only claw machine we had in the store, so using another one for parts (or using this one for parts to fix that one) wasn't an option. I went to the back room and checked if we had any power supplies. Finding anything back there was always a chore due to the lack of organization. I found that most of them were 12 V power supplies. I didn't think wiring them in series for 24V would actually work due to the capacitors in the power supply, and I'd hate to ruin a good power supply trying it. \n\nWell, I decided to take a closer look at some other machines to see if their power supplies will work. Nah, most of them are 12 volts. But, a long-deceased driving game (the motherboard quit) with a force feedback motor on the steering wheel had a 24V power supply that still worked! I put a note on the machine \"Power supply removed for claw machine up front, PS make / model was x/y, specs were z\" so if anyone objected, they could revert it to it's original state, and if they found a replacement motherboard, they'd know what power supply to get. Now for the cord.\n\nEvery machine I could find back there had the ground prong missing. What the heck is it with the lack of ground prongs? Pretty much everything in the back either belonged to a customer, or appeared to be a \"scrap\" machine. But there was nothing I could \"steal\" an intact cord from, all the good ones had long since been taken to fix other machines, and none of them had been replaced. At this point I had already mentioned to the boss that we needed more cords or plugs, so I decided to not pester him about it.\n\nWell, I could at least half-fix the machine. With the wires already labeled, I unplugged the machine, removed the old power supply and connected the wires to the new one. I put the fuse back in, but did not connect the \"hot\" wire from the cord back to the new PSU, since we still needed to fix the missing ground issue. I figured if they saw the machine was \"working\" again, they wouldn't see the need to fix the ground issue. \n\nA few days later, I noticed someone playing the machine. At least they weren't getting shocked, but out of curiosity, I looked at the cord when they were done playing. What do you know, a new plug was put on. It was even done properly, what more do you want? Other than a new pulley, where the original still had a washer glued on it. \n\nA few more days later, the inevitable happened and the washer came unglued, allowing the string to tangle up again. I asked around about what kind of glue was used, so that I could try a different kind of glue, but no one knows what was originally used. I wasn't sure anything would work that well between metal and plastic. With the string tangled up, I was worried that if someone tried to play the machine, the up/down motor might burn out or the gears could strip. Therefore, I disconnected the power supply inside the machine once again.\n\nI had figured that sometime the next day, I could try super glueing the washer back on. The beginning of that day, I turned the machines on like always. I was the only one who turned them off after closing, my coworkers left them on. A few minutes later, I hear the dreaded sound of \"capacitor popcorn\" coming from the general direction of the claw machine. \n\nSure enough, the claw machine was quickly filling with smoke. I unplugged it quickly and grabbed the fire extinguisher and flung the door open. There were no actual flames, so rather than actually spray, I waited to see if the smoke died down on it's own. Thankfully, it did. It was coming from the motherboard and the power supply. Oh fsck.\n\nI took a closer look and found that one of the connectors had been pulled out, but then put back in backwards. To be fair, they weren't keyed which meant this was possible without the use of a hammer. However, the connectors didn't need to be unplugged to begin with. I unscrewed the board and approached my coworker.\n\nMe: \"Were you messing with the claw machine, by any chance?\" \nIdiot: \"Yeah, the machine wasn't working again so I figured I could pull the connectors out and put them back in again and it would work\"\nMe: \"Well you put it in backwards\"\nIdiot: \"So? Just put it back the right way\"\nMe: (Screaming internally, I put the board where it's plainly visible to him, with all the burned traces, popped capacitors and chips with craters in them, all visible) \"It's destroyed. You reverse a connector or put it in the wrong hole, this is what happens. Did you not see all that smoke or hear those popping noises? If I hadn't been there, it might have caused a fire.\"\n\nRemember how there was no information about this machine available anywhere? Even with the manufacturer's name in hand, I couldn't even find a picture of it, let alone a manual. This meant that finding an entire circuit board, or even just a programmed microcontroller, would have been darn near impossible. Okay, I suppose it would be technically possible, but only to the extent that winning the lottery would also be \"technically possible\". In other words, realistically, we were never going to find another motherboard for this machine. It's fate was sealed.\n\nTL;DR: Claw machine gets a band-aid fix for the broken pulley. Later on, a deadly electrical short occurs and both my coworkers insist that it remain plugged in despite it being a death trap. I fixed the short by replacing the power supply. Someone replaced the plug, properly. But then, one of the idiots tried \"fixing\" the machine by reseating the connectors, but accidentally reversed it and burned out the motherboard.",

I was a senior engineer which was basically a glorified L1 engineer that took charge in Managers absence.   \n\n\n**STORY:**  \nIt was a Sunday I had started work nice an early and was the senior engineer on duty with 2 other junior engineers.   \n\n\nAn outage occurred in quite a large segment of out network so we where all hands on deck fielding calls for a 200 - 300 user segment of the network, when I received a call from a user.\n\n\"Thank you for Calling \\[Company Name\\] Your speaking to Matthew, How can I assist?\" I say in my best telephone voice.\n\nShe replies \"My Internet is off\" in a frustrated tone.\n\nAt this moment I realize the customer is upset and most likely affecting by the outage we have, but due to process I need to create a ticket and link user to the parent case for email and SMS updates on the ongoing issue.\n\nKindly ask the user \"No problem Ma'am, I just need to locate your account. Please may I have the account holders name and an email address or account ID?\"\n\nShe then screams \"\\[Customers Physical address\\]!\"\n\nNow normally this is enough to locate an account but we are tasked to confirm 3 or more details on the account to make sure that we are speaking to the user in question and to ensure that we are somewhat upholding GDPR and not leaking information.\n\nI kindly repeat to the user \"Please may I have the account holders name or telephone number as well?\"\n\nShe then proceeds to scream at me \"YOU DO NOT NEED THIS INFORMATION I HAVE DEALT WITH THIS TECH SUPPORT MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT BECAUSE MY INTERNET IS SO SH$#...!\"\n\nAt this moment I give the customer the benefit of the doubt and understand internet problems are frustrating and ask the user \"Please ma'am, I require this information to confirm that I am speaking to the account holder\"\n\nUser goes quite for 10 seconds there is an awkward silence...\n\nUser: \"You dont work for \\[Company Name\\], Do you?\"\n\nShocked by the question because who in their right mind would want to work in a call center during an outage \"Excuse me Ma'am???\" I reply confused.\n\n\"Your a Thief! You have broken into the office and are stealing customers info...\" \n\nI cut the call mid sentence, I look at my Juniors who are both staring at me and say \"I am not paid enough to deal with that...\" \n\nCustomer proceeded to call over and over but I spent the next 2 hours dropping her call every time I saw it in the call queue.\n\nLet my boss know to check the call recordings, I get a laughing emoji in response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6 Days later I find 16 customer service complaints logged against me that no-one in management or Customer service team told me about.\n\nListen to the Voicemails attached to tickets.  \n\n\n\"Hello??? There is someone in your office stealing peoples information, I am worried about your staffs safety. He kept asking me for my information and when I asked him why he needed this information he told me it is because it is what I want and when I asked him if he truly works for \\[Company name\\] he said no he doesn't and told me to F#$% Off.... Please I am worried about your staffs safety... and also my internet is off\"\n\nI must have listened to this voice recording a 100 times and was declared the Data Thief of the office.  \n\n\nNever dealt with a more delusional customer before, I asked the higher ups if they terminated her contract like they have in the past for abusing staff on the phone they neither confirmed or denied that they had but we have never heard from them since :)  \n\n\nDon't let customers treat you like trash.",

        "text": "At this crappy gameroom store I used to work in, we had a claw machine. Ever since I had started there, the claw had been stuck: it would move forward, backward, left and right, but not up and down.\n\nI took it upon myself to try and figure out the problem. First, I opened it up and unscrewed the cover over the \"box\" that held the mechanism that moved the claw up and down. One of the plastic pulleys was broken in such a way that the little string could slip off and get stuck. Indeed, the string was already tangled up every which way. Now, I hadn't dealt with a claw machine before, so some kind of manual would help if I could find one. I'll also need to figure out who built the thing to be able to order a part for it. \n\nNow, the claw machine had a name on the \"marquee\" but it did not show a manufacturer's name. I opened up the machine and look for any evidence of who made the thing. There is none: the machine is literally built with no-name parts. The motors, the board, the power supply, all lack any manufacturer's name on them. On an unrelated note, I found a manual for a completely different machine, stuffed inside this claw machine.\n\nWell, the machine itself obviously wasn't the best place to find the manufacturer's info in this case. So I punted and just Googled (name of machine) claw machine. \n\nWell, disappointingly, after going through page after page (while doing other things around the store in between) I found practically nothing pointing me in the direction of who made this thing, or even, for that matter, if the company still exists.\n\nLater, someone found an old brochure online from a well-known arcade game manufacturer, advertising the machine. A company that was still in business! Great! So I called them up. \n\nOops, premature celebration. It turns out that company also used to *sell* other machines that they themselves did not make, and this was one of them. The company that actually made the machine itself had long since gone bankrupt. The support rep also didn't know of any machines that shared any parts with this one. But on the other hand, I am now armed with the name of the original manufacturer, so I may not be able to order original parts, but I could probably find information about how this thing is supposed to work so that I can rethread the string properly.\n\nArmed with the name of the manufacturer, I turned to Google again. I Googled and Googled until my Googler was sore, and, for the lack of a phrase that rhymes, I found ZERO evidence that the manufacturer *ever* existed or what they made.\n\nI had tried (name with an A) and (other name with an O) in case I heard the guy wrong over the phone. I tried it as one word, and as two words. None of which yielded any additional results to even tell me which name was accurate.\n\nIn short, I was back to square one.\n\nThe next time I came back to this machine, I decided to try finding parts another way. I used calipers to take measurements of the pulleys that the string wrapped around, so that I could order replacements whose measurements matched. \n\nAs I looked up claw machine parts, I was rather disconcerted to find that, out of everyone that makes or sells parts for claw machines in general, *all* of them listed the specific machine(s) that the parts would fit and *none* of them listed the dimensions! So my measurements weren't worth a quarter.\n\nLater on, a light bulb came on over my head. Perhaps some industrial suppliers might sell pullies for other purposes that happen to match the size, or at least be close enough? After all, there's nothing particularly extravagent or unusual about these pullies as far as I can tell. \n\nI spent some time searching around industrial machine suppliers that took small-quantity orders. I decided to simply forward links to the product pages to my boss, so that he could research the actual suppliers and decide on which one was the best one to use. I also forwarded the measurements as well, in case he had another kind of machine with a similar enough part to fit, or for that matter, try to fabricate something. I also pointed out that the plug was missing the ground prong, so we would need to order more replacement plugs unless we had some somewhere that I didn't know about.\n\nStay tuned for the second part of the story.",

        "text": "I worked at a company that made 110VAC and 220VAC motors, all of which had some degree of control intelligence built into them. Some of them only had a soft-start routine along with current protection (so if something stopped the motor from turning, it wouldn't burn out) but others allowed an input from an external system to control them. The soft start ability would save energy in the long run for things that had to cycle on and off a lot.\n\nThe previous owners of the building also had the need to test certain things on 220VAC as well. How did they do this? No, of course they didn't use a proper outlet into which only 220VAC plugs would fit. They wired a regular 110VAC outlet to be 220VAC instead. You can probably guess where this is going.\n\nSo as I understand it, they wanted to use the power strip as a convenient switch for their motor. The power strip they chose was also a surge protector, which by definition does something to prevent an excessive voltage from reaching devices plugged into it. There are power strips that are JUST power strips, and we had several of those, which didn't give a hoot about the input voltage. Surge protectors, on the other hand, *must* react to an overvoltage, by definition.\n\nI was working on something else when my coworker brought me the surge protector. He admitted that he hooked it up to 220 and it went \"pop\" and didn't work anymore. I set it aside, and kept at my current project until I was done with it. \n\nLater on, I had nothing better to do, so I decide to take apart the surge protector, assuming there's any way to do so non-destructively in the first place. And indeed, there was. It wasn't designed intentionally to *prevent* repairs, but it wasn't designed with repairs in mind, either. I'll leave it at that. \n\nI was looking for a fuse, but before I even found it, I saw the problem. The traces that once carried the input power were *gone* and the surface of the board itself has two big burn marks where the traces used to be. There actually *was* a thermal fuse next to the MOVs, as well as a circuit breaker which was part of the switch. Both of which did diddly squat. I'll explain in a comment how (most) surge protectors work.\n\nI showed my coworker the burned up board, and he thankfully didn't try to get me to \"fix\" it. \n\nTL;DR: electrical codes exist for a reason. A 110V outlet wired for 220V is a recipe for disaster",

I know it's IT and it confuses some people, but I feel like I'm not getting a chance to guide them or they're not even really trying to tell me what's going on and assume I can see everything that's going on there.

        "text": "So I lead a corporate IT team that supports a particular kind of platform; back in the day, these were first called PDM systems, for Product Data Management, as they worked like electronic libraries where people could only check-out files if they were checked in.\n\nOur ticketing system for user support has groups for the different teams. We have a \"Corporate PDM\" group for our team's stuff. If any other organization at the company needs to assign a ticket to us, they just put it in the \"Corporate PDM\" group and we get notified of it. There is even a document in the ticketing system, so if you search for \"PDM\" then this document comes up and says, \"Assign to the 'Corporate PDM' group.\" We can see on a ticket if someone searched for such a ticketing system document and indicated it was the solution.\n\nOur corporation acquired another company a few years back. One thing that Old Company -- let's call them OLDco -- had in-progress was an attempt to put a PDM system in place.\n\nAt first, it sounded like our PDM group would have to provide support to the users of this other PDM system, but our management wanted it kept separate from our \"normal\" tickets. So we created a new group in the ticketing system, called \"Corporate PDM - OLDco\" to be distinctive.\n\nAfter having done that, and after the folks at that acquired company saw our PDM system, they decided to abandon their project. We never used the group, and we dropped members from it, so no one got notifications about it.\n\nOur mistake was in not requesting deletion of the \"Corporate PDM - OLDco\" group at that time.\n\nEvery so often, the ticketing system people see this unused group and decide to harvest it. They ask me, and I say to go ahead. Then they come back and say they can't, there's a ticket in it.\n\nLo and behold, they are right. Such tickets are put in by folks in IT helpdesks in other countries. We all use the same ticketing system, but apparently they hear that someone was once part of OLDco, so they look for groups with OLDco in the name to assign the ticket. It is important to understand that there are no ticketing system help documents that tell anyone to use the \"Corporate PDM - OLDco\" group. Not one. So these other helpdesk people are not following proper procedure in assigning tickets.\n\nSo, I take the tickets (which are weeks or months old at that point), reassign them to the proper group, ask the IT agent who assigned them to the wrong place why they did it, and to update whatever documentation they are using, because they shouldn't do this again.\n\nBut the next time a harvest cycle comes around, the same problem crops up with someone else who put a ticket in there. It's like playing whack-a-mole with a game that's been put in storage, but someone won't unplug it while a mole is sticking up, and they won't let the person who whacks the mole do the unplugging.\n\nIt feels like I've been doing this every quarter of the last two years. Today, I got ahold of someone who is involved in the harvest process, and he says they will expedite the harvest, hopefully it will happen tomorrow.\n\nI'm keeping my fingers crossed, but I am not holding my breath.",

        "text": "A story from my next job after I moved on from MyBoss. It’s another small business, my job isn’t actually IT support but of course I’m the one providing it. It’s 2011 by now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNextBoss has a requirement for computers for a one time job in another city but with the plan to expand so the resources can be used for further odd jobs away from our main site. He wants portable and simple to set up, so about a dozen laptops. \n\nNextBoss: “Problem is we need to meet the documented performance requirement that a 5400RPM 2.5” hard drive won’t give us, but to go with SSDs takes us way over budget. They only come in laptops on the high end. We don’t need that high a spec for CPU and RAM but you can’t get entry or mid level laptops with SSDs”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeurons fire with the brilliance of Creation itself. Across synapses a universe is born, erupts into being with the rage and violence of the First Thought, “I AM”. The laws of physics are written in the cosmic forge, order begins it’s rule and the order is Chaos. Everything and all is fire beyond fire. \n\nThe birth scream of reality itself soothes. It cools and hardens, forms mass. The dust settles. The dust attracts, dust to dust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe First Life. The First Death. The first consumption of another life to sustain life, the first blood meal. The First Kill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlamahen urges his tamed beasts to hurry. The sun has set but the sky is lit, war has come to the valley. Fire beyond the hills, and howling. Always war, endless war. He must keep moving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValaceran stands accused. His heresy exposed, his books burnt and instruments smashed at his feet. He is sentenced to the flame. “The Ultimate Judgement awaits you in the afterlife!!”. “No”, he smiles as the crowd harass him with stones and the executioner throws the torch “No, it does not”.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKaralenlin steps out into the void. Hers are the first eyes to look down upon her home from above, so fragile and bright in the aching darkness. If only they could see, she wails. Powerless, hopeless. Weightless. If only they could see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSacaranan gives the order. “JUMP!” Spacetime kneels at the heel of the experimental vessel. Vast distances fold and touch. The technology works! To travel, NO! Not moved, but exchanged between points across the vast expanse in an instant! This will give their masters the decisive weapon against the enemy, victory is assured!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMenistahen gazes down in sombre anticipation. Quiet falls upon the audience chamber, crushing grinding breathless panicked silence. Finally, “There can be no doubt?”. “No, Most Excellent Majesty. There is no error, it is confirmed”. Sobbing, “Every result from across the seven galaxies concludes the same. We live in an illusion, a simulation. Reality, the entire universe is a construct. Some sort of.. process. A kind of exercise. Everything we are, everything we do, is to achieve some sort of calculation? We do not exist in the concrete sense, we are the reflections and shadows of holograms. Without any substance whatsoever”. The Eternal Emperor breaks from his being held bound dumbstruck. His first thought, his first words. His squealed begging despair. “Then why do we fight? Why have we waged.. What was it all for??”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTalahansen takes a moment. The first moment, they realise, only for themself. The first breaths, the first heartbeats not given in service, for the cause. They deserve a moment, do they not? Just a tiny share of time only for them and them alone. Why not? It doesn’t mean anything anyway. It isn’t real, nothing is. Nothing IS. All that war that never was. The moment passes. They plead, to no one but for the sake of pleading. If none of it was real, if none of us were real, if we were all nothing but the ghosts of interpretations, echoes of whispered suggestion.. Please let us become something. Please let us take any kind of form. Please let us BE. If it takes the death of a universe to end the madness, end the chaos, let it materialise. Let it matter. Let us transcend into something. Even if it’s still not real. Even if it’s still not tangible or measurable. Please let me be something. Please let me become a force, an influence. They place their hand on the activation control of the device. Please let me be an expression. Or a choice. Or a determination. Even just an idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: “We could get the cheaper laptops, replace the hard drives with SSDs, grab a cheap RAID card off ebay and I build you that backup server you’ve been wanting? Lovely lovely identical model hard disks for a budget eight disk fault tolerant backup server. You get the laptops up to spec within budget plus some basic data security we desperately need. The extra drives will be your cold spares”\n\nNextBoss: “That’s inspired, I like that”",
