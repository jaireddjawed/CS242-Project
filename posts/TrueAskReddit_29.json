And this has me confused.\n\nSurely a true follower of a religion is one who does what their Holy Book commands? If person A does as the religions commands and person B rarely does it, why is person A not the \"real\" follower?\n\nIt is strange to me that people who use their personal conscience are considered the real followers, when conscience has nothing to do with it - It's not about being logical or feeling right about it, it is about **actually following rules and commandents of your religion**.",

Everybody knows the infamous Churchill quote about voters which keeps ringing true and when things are going worse for people they tend to vote for volatile populistic candidates; often outsiders who make a mess of things. We see this now in the States and in Europe. Then there is the lack of long-term ideas, plans and foreign policy because governments keep changing colour. \n\nFor instance you have China which does vote but can't reasonably be called a democracy. China is through there political system able to make long-term plans and decisions and they are able to make the decisions where needed in a relatively short time: think of the recent huge investment in environmental technology while the West is still struggling through democracy to properly aknowledge climate change.\n\nI'm not advocating for implementing China's system; it's simply a different way of doing things that has its own merits and drawbacks, but I do think we need to think about the way we rule our countries here in the West in this fast changing world.",

It seems like 5 out of 10 stores I enter have a sign \"no chip, please swipe\" even though they have the Chip reader on the machine.\n\nWhy are we so behind? According to the history of credit cards, the US might as well be given full credit for the creation of the modern credit card, but at this rate, by the time we have RFID, my Brit coworker will say, \"oh, that, we haven't used that in years, we now use _____\"",

In my mind, if you're not qualified to be a jury, I don't think you should vote either.\n\nP.S. I'm not from US",
