That's totally fine, but I just prefer the twisty ones.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had advice for which of the rest of the episodes I should watch (and which to skip) if I only wanted to see the ones that have unexpected plot twists, like White Bear/White Christmas?\n\nFor example, I read the plot summary for Nosedive, which is one of the episodes I see recommended a lot, but it seems like another one of the ones that's just a sad story as opposed to having any particular plot-changing twist.",

Do they really feel or is this what they are supposed to do? Interesting thing to explore.\n\n- synthetic prostitutes : idk why but such a thing they could make an episode with.\n\n- relation with humans : how the humans can manage their feelings for a non-human robot that looks totally like them.\n\n- shared memories : when the new Zoe forgives Cole because she has the memories of the first Zoe, it made me questioning the concept. Could some robots have the same memorie but react differently? Could them have an immediate memory to deal with? Like a connection of the whole squad of robots.\n\nAnd for me the best concept for a BM episode :\n- love pills : I don't really get why they introduced this concept in the movie but that's truly fascinating for me. The way they find a partner for taking the love drug together looks like the way some strangers make out for a night irl. Just living an one shot experience of what love could be. And the fact that after some takes they cannot fall in love without the pills is really scary.\n\nIf you found more just say it in the comment. Sorry for my messy english. ",

But what happens to those who just don’t have it in them? There are many personalities that are passive, does that mean the likelihood of them finding the perfect match via the system is slim to none? \n\nAnother thing, at the end, Amy was able to freeze the system so they could escape, which goes to show that the other “people” were just part of the simulation. So my question is, was every date they went on just part of it? The way I’d assume it works (considering the basis of finding the perfect match is rebelling with your match) is that obviously it’s all about that one person, therefore every succeeding date after the first would be a horrible match, leading you to wanting to be with the initial, and how much you actually want that person. But what about that girl Frank got with who also seemed to be hooked on someone else? It means she was also a player in the simulation. Which means they actually have a chance of finding a real player who they jive with better? That seems to defeat the purpose.",

She has had (presumably) many years to think about this and wants to go the way of her husband and daughter into sweet oblivion. Classic Black Mirror tragic ending.\n\nBut then it all gets flipped on its head in five minutes, and apparently, in a couple of contemplative shots, Kelly decides to overturn a decision matured over decades of life and actually does go back to SJ.\n\nI liked the episode, but I felt like that final twist was undeserved. Kelly went from \"You are selfish and foolish, I have made my decision\" to \"Alright guess I will spend eternity with you after all\" for no reason I could discern, other than shoehorning in the first happy ending in the series.\n\nHave I missed something? What did Yorkie do to deserve the happy ending? Were the two 3-second-shots of contemplative Kelly meant to be her reconsidering her decision? \n\nI feel like the episode would have been much better, equally so, in either of two ways:\n\n1. If it had been 10 minutes shorter and stuck with the tragic ending\n2. If it had been 10 minutes longer and actually showed Kelly's development into deciding to forego oblivion for Yorkie\n\nI am not in Brooker's brain, but it felt like he decided to turn the ending on its head at the last minute without realizing the episode only had a few more minutes to go.\n\nHelp me understand this, please, fanbase.",

Only now on the second time did I realize it was fake, and I don’t know why. It was certainly weird and all and I have a lot of weird dreams but this specific one has happened twice now and each time I remember it being a Black Mirror episode, when it’s not.\n\n\nI could run you through it if you like, though it won’t make much sense. Anyone else had this happen to them?",
