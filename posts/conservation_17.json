        "text": "Recently I came across some quite upsetting views about our supposed duty to change nature to make it more moral. Negative utilitarian philosophers like David \\Pearce, Brian Tomassik and others support human interventions in nature which will reduce suffering of all sentient beings. Other than supporting veganism and radical animal rights, they do also are against conservation and the current earth's ecosystem. They believe in reducing suffering no matter the cost, for example making predators extinct, reducing prey reproduction to prevent overpopulation, and finally changing the genetic code of the biosphere to make it cause less suffering to itself. Now that action may be placed far out in the future, or even start from now. Brian Tomassik for example supports that we can start from now, and that we should support habitat destruction as it reduces animal populations, and so collective suffering. He also take into account insect suffering and advocates for humane insecticides rather than presumably evolutionarily familiar and so painful ways of population check like disease or predation. He also assumes minute amounts of suffering to plants, fungi, bacteria, or even simulations, and thinks that something can be done about that in the far future. But most of the time no one of these authors cares about non-animal suffering, so the efforts of most of them concern with animals.\n\nI don't know if we as a species will be capable in the far future to reach the developments transhumanists predict, but implementing something like the above now will be extremely catastrophic for the whole ecosystem and maybe increase suffering in fact. It is extremely anthropocentric, as we have no reason to project our own western moral judgments on other species neither we are able to acurately know how much do they suffer. It reminds me of policies taken in the past to prevent suffering in human societies, which proved disastrous.\n\nSo my question is, how much public support do these views have? Are they a direct threat to conservation efforts?",
