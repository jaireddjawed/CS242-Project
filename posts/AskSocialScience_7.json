        "text": "I learned about this today and was shocked that I hadn't heard about it before.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair\n&gt;The Sokal affair, also called the Sokal hoax,[1] was a scholarly publishing sting perpetrated by Alan Sokal, a physics professor at New York University and University College London. In 1996, Sokal submitted an article to Social Text, an academic journal of postmodern cultural studies. The submission was an experiment to test the journal's intellectual rigor and, specifically, to investigate whether \"a leading North American journal of cultural studies – whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross – [would] publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions\".[2]\n\nI thought maybe things had changed since 1996, but then I read about this scholarly sting that happened last year.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Boghossian#Cogent_Social_Sciences_hoax_paper\n&gt;In 2017, Boghossian and his colleague James Lindsay published a hoax paper in the pay-to-publish journal Cogent Social Sciences. They initially submitted the paper to the unranked Norma, where it was rejected, and then submitted, on recommendation from Norma, to Cogent Social Sciences, where it was peer reviewed and accepted. The paper, later revealed as a hoax in Skeptic magazine, intended to highlight a couple of problems: firstly, the \"echo-chamber\" of morally driven postmodernist social sciences and, secondly, the problem of \"lax standards\" with pay-to-publish journals.[14] The journal later retracted the paper.[15]\n\nOh, and this happened in 2001. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Maffesoli#Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9s_hoax\n&gt;Manuel Quinon and Arnaud Saint-Martin, two sociologists who were students of Michel Maffesoli in the early 2000s, have taken inspiration from the Sokal hoax to demonstrate the lack of intellectual rigour in Maffesoli's work, as well as the absence of any serious peer review in one of the two journals that he directs.\n\n&gt;Using a false identity, Quinon and Saint-Martin submitted an intentionally inept and absurd article on the \"Autolib'\", a small rentable car in Paris, to the Sociétés journal. The article was deliberately incoherent and plastered with liberal quotes and references to Maffesoli and other postmodern thinkers. The article was duly \"reviewed\" by two people, before being accepted and published in Sociétés without any substantial editing.\n\n&gt;The authors of the hoax published an article explaining their aims and methods in March 2015.[29][30][31] The hoax article was then quickly withdrawn from the publishing platform on which it appeared.\n\nSo, it seems that there's a problem with the social sciences in particular when it comes to publishing nonsense, as long as it appeals to their ideological worldview.\n\nPresumably these hit the academic community hard when these stories came out. So what has been done to combat this?",

        "text": "I was listening to [this episode](https://art19.com/shows/the-ezra-klein-show/episodes/34703ccd-ae41-4d54-9197-344acd5699af) of the Ezra Klein show with NK Jemisin. At around 1:13:07 she tells a story of how she met an Italian family. During introductions, the Americans introduced themselves by profession and the Italians introduced themselves by region. She goes into how this represents that Americans are dominated by capitalistic thinking (and presumably that this is not also true of the Italians). The American introduction exists primarily to ascertain someone's class and, therefore, their social worth. While I would say I tend to agree with NK Jemisin on a lot of her social perspectives, I see what seem to be problems with this interpretation:\n\n1. Given no context, it seems that we can come up with an equally valid collectivist interpretation of this question: Americans first introduce each other by the role one plays in society. They are concerned with how each of us participates and what our contributions are. For the Italians, geography is important because it is used to associate with low-culture or inferior geographic regions. The poor are generally relegated to certain areas and the wealthy others, so the Italian greeting is used primarily to ascertain whether or not someone is from a good neighborhood whereas the American greeting is about determining how this person contributes to their community.\"\n\n2. Class and profession are not clearly linked. If someone says they are an actor, there are a huge range of potential incomes and lifestyles that could be associated with such a profession. George Clooney and someone doing local theater work are definitely not in the same social class. \n\nI realize that Jemisin is an author, not a sociologist, but throughout the episode she does talk a lot about sociology which leads me to believe she has potentially more insight into these things than I. Still, while it may be true that Americans greet one another this way because of some ideological priors, the connection seems more like trying to find a relationship to affirm an interpretation rather than something we can take to be true.\n\nSo, to clarify: How do sociologists interpret these types of questions? Is the example she gives a good one about how our ideology permeates our social norms? If yes, how do we rule out alternative interpretations? If no, how do we find instances of this in societies and compare them?",

        "text": "My oldest just turned three and we took him to orientation for preschool and noticed in the handbook that they don’t allow kids to wear or bring in anything that depicts a superhero.  It also banned anything related to the military.  I know it’s supposedly to prevent exposure to violent symbols. I’ve noticed that in general the cartoons kids watch seem to have a much softer gentler tone than ones from earlier generations.  I’m not writing because I think it’s a bad thing but just trying to understand it.  I saw an old Disney film a while back (I forget which one) featuring Mickey and Donald and it shocked me to see the characters throwing punches and saying things that didn’t feel right for my own kid to watch.  So it seems my sensibility is also more gentle than what was average 1 or 2 generations ago - I’m part of the same trend.\n\nI’m not asking if it’s right or wrong but more: what drives this change?  Is our society shifting to having less of a masculine character and this one of the effects?  I often see people that are upset about political correctness and complain that people are ‘too sensitive’ these days - to the extent those complaints describe a real phenomenon, is this connected?  I guess in general: what’s different about society today from that of past generations that makes things like superheroes feel inappropriate?  Is there an actual shift happening or not?  If so how would it appropriately be described?",

        "text": "My intuition is that the consumer side of cultural markets is structured simultaneously in two ways:\n(1) Consumers like to attach to products they deem superior in quality. Since quality is hard to measure for cultural products such as songs, books, and leisure activities, consumers use popularity as a proxy for quality (see e.g. http://science.sciencemag.org/content/311/5762/854). This would produce a structure of success-breeds-success. \n(2) Consumers look to their immediate peers (friends and family) to determine what to consume, independently from global popularity. This would produce a lifestyle-cluster-like structure. \n\nAs I said, I have that intuition. I have searched for papers investigating this twofoldness. There is a lot of disconnected and fragmented research on lifestyles, subcultures, network effects on decisions of various kinds, and sucess dynamics in markets. However, nothing seems to actually address this. I know this might be very vague, but do you guys have any suggestions for literature, or arguments counter my intuition? \n\nNote: I am not asking for homework or university related work. I am a grad student of Sociology, but this is just something I have been thinking about for a while now. \n\n",

This inspired me to re-run his study with undergraduates at the uni where I work. I ran the experiments and collected data. For demographics, I have whether the participant was born in the US and what countries he/she has lived in other than the US and for how long.\n\nMy problem is differentiating between who to call \"American\" and who not to. I want to first only use the data of those who have definitely espoused American culture and thinking patterns.  I know that everyone born in the US or who came here at a very young age would fit this category. My confusion is what to do with those who are 18 years old to 24 years old and came to the US at 13-16 years old. What does literature on immigration and assimilation say about this? Is there an age after which people are less likely to adopt the thinking patterns, culture, etc. of the new country and keep those of the country of origin? How long does it take for someone to assimilate (if it happens at all). Also, should someone who is 42 years old and has been in the US since 18 be considered \"Americanized\" or be left out of this first part of my study? ",

I understand the state of flow and everything. But why are man/boys so affected? Why are they always there?\n\nLike... what is making woman not getting as affected? Why are man mostly addicted to game like MMORPGs and the like?\n\nI've seen some people in some reddits say it is because of solitude.\n\nWhile I do agree it is a part of it, I would argue it cannot be the sole reason. There are extremely social people in there too. Actually, the only underrepresented men I ever seen in such cases were those too busy to game, outside of it every single kind of man i've seen was affected at some point. Why is that? and why are women so rare?\n\nEDIT: I have a hypothesis. The games connect and game gives men a purpose. Replacing what in the old days would be the bar and the church places. Women naturally gets those as their sexuality permits them to achieve much. While men are stuck. But it is just a baseless hipothesis made by a not so happy gamer. I want a real answer.",

Request references if you feel my statements aren't fair though.\n\n* Gay men seem to do well for themselves, attaining higher education levels than heterosexuals. Gay men also show lower crime rates than heterosexual men one exception being drugs.\n\n* In contrast, black men don't attain the same academic performance as their fellow white men, and are more involved in crime.\n\nWhy does one group *thrive* in the face of discrimination, while the other suffers under it? Do black men just get discriminated harder against? Is it because gay men can hide their homosexuality and evade discrimination, something which people of colour cannot? What does the literature say? Is there any?\n\n",
