However, I'm not sure how to browse all the possibilities.\n\nI would love to go somewhere far and interesting in the world, like Japan or the US, but ultimately Europe would be fine too (or anywhere really). I'm interested in theoretical physics, I would love to eventually work on new models of gravity and quantum physics, and high-view topics like that. I would also love to just do math theory related to physics, so far I loved differential geometry and topology the most.\n\nHowever, I think I would also enjoy other fields, including ones that aren't pure physics, that I don't know much about yet. Examples are quantum computers, cognitive sciences, machine learning and AI theory, or even evolution and microbiology. To be clear, I do have some skills in programming and some knowledge of these other topics, but not much formally. Basically I'm not afraid of throwing myself into new fields and just doing something interesting. Hopefully some of the research teams are looking for physicists.\n\nSo, my question is, how (and when) to find places and positions for any of these fields? Anywhere in the world. And yes, I'd need to earn money or have a scholarship, I'm not rich xD\n\nFor reference, my final paper was on gravitational waves. And I'm not sure if I want to go into that specific field, I'd rather not, but it is an option.",

Well I was good at solving problems, I always considered physics as a step stone back then.  \n\nI'm in my mid 30s now and just got laid off by my company. Somebody wanted me to do a mock class for a teaching position. I reviewed physics a bit (after so many years) and find it really fun. Solving problems was once my passion. I even went back to my old classic mechanics book to find long lost joy.\n\nI'm now thinking since this is what I'm good at and I really enjoying Physics. I would like to explore it as a career. I only have a master's in physics. I do not have a teaching licences (tho I don't mind getting one). What kind of career or job I can get a decent wages for living. I know it's probably lower than tech with my credential. Just exploring my options",

        "text": "Dear Physics Community of Reddit,\n\nI am currently studying machine learning and I am looking for some inspiration for my thesis surrounding the \"principle of locality\". As you might know in machine learning it basically all comes down to function approximation (and search, but lets focus on function approximation here). A neural network is a general function approximator which means in theory it is capable of represent any function. But here the physics of our universe comes into play: The class of functions found in nature are not \"general\" but a rather narrow class of functions, namely functions obeying the principle of locality.  You could call it some kind of \"recursive locality\" our world seems to have. Exploiting this property is ofc. very helpful for designing parameter-efficient models and this is the goal my thesis: Formulating a model for this principle formally for the use in machine learning. I would appreciate any contributions, hints or ideas from a physics point of view regarding this idea:\n\n1. How do physicists think of this property mathematically? Could you think of a \"general\" model for describing this \"recursive locality\" used in physics? (i.e graphs or fields?)\n2. Do you think a local model is sufficient to model the \"human observable\" phenomena of our world? My goal here is NOT to model physical/chemical processes but more \"human-scale\" observations. \n3. Do you know of any other ideas/hints sources to look into? \n\nI appreciate any contribution and reply.",

        "text": "I am a novice astrophotographer and recently got into narrowband imaging where people use bandpass filters to increase contrast of signals from nebulae (such as Ha, OIII, SII) to other signals from the night sky (broadband RGB/IR). The title is a question that came up during a conversation with a friend who studies audio signal processing. In audio it's very common to use band-pass filters to create signals with only certain frequencies. It doesn't matter whether you did the frequency cut-off during recording or in post-processing.\n\nAs we discussed about narrowband imaging in astrophotography, he wondered whether it would be possible to extract certain frequencies from the spectrum of the image and reconstruct the image.\n\nIntuitively this shouldn't be possible, otherwise astrophotographers would be fools to ever use physical band-pass filters if they could simply reconstruct a narrowband image from RGB data, and scientists would be fools to ever use dedicated spectrographs for any research. \n\nBut the question is why? Is it possible to reconstruct the wavelength information of photons AFTER they have reached the sensor? I tried searching online but the closest I got was this on MATLAB answers:\n\n[Filter out visible-light from an IR image](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/182157-filter-out-visible-light-from-an-ir-image)\n\n&gt;If your goal is to do that AFTER image capture, that will require knowledge of the sensor sensitivities, and the RGB definition of what it returns. Then you can form a simple mapping to give an approximation.\n\nIf the answer to the title is **\"No\"**, what makes image sensing different from audio recording such that wavelength information is no longer recoverable after data capture?\n\nP.S. A few weeks ago a PI in biomedical imaging made a presentation at our graduate students seminar where she demonstrated the use of RGB data to detect certain chemical changes instead of colorimeters or spectrographs. Is it related to the question I asked here?",

        "text": "\n\n  Mathematical model of Marx's CAPITAL.\n\nThere is a deep connection between physics and political economy. But the main difficulty in discovering this analogy is ambiguity. To eliminate this ambiguity, it was necessary to write down the categories of political economy in the form of eight-dimensional vectors. But this work has paid off. But this was not enough to build mathematical models in the political economy. The theory of relativity became a science only when the speed of light was recognized as a fundamental constant. And it was clear that a fundamental constant should also be introduced into the political economy. It turned out to be the fundamental constant of value.\n\nAs a result, it was possible to write down the Marx equations in the form of the Mendeleev-Klayperon equation from the theory of gases. The main results of this reduction of political economy to physics are as follows:\n\n1. Consumer value is the entropy of the market.\n\n2. Consumer mass is the total heat capacity of the market.\n\n3. A capitalist firm operates on the Carnot cycle as a new type of heat engine. There is no such heat engine in technology, but it can be created.\n\nBut only part of the work on the mathematization of Marx's CAPITAL was done. There is only one fundamental constant in our model-the cost constant. And in the model of developed capitalism there is another fundamental constant-the rate of profit.\n\nBut even earlier, before starting work, it was clear that Hegel's dialectic needed to be formalized. And the beginning of this work has been done. Philosophy studies specific pairs: FAITH IS MIND, FORM IS BODY. We began to study abstract dialectical pairs A-B, C-D. The algebraic operation of multiplying dialectical pairs was introduced. And thus it was possible to obtain some theorems of philosophy and political economy in an algebraic way.\n\nAnd now we need to introduce the alphabet, the rules of inference to build a complete mathematical model of Hegel's dialectic. Our task was to point out the pitfalls along the way. The fact is that it is impossible to completely reduce philosophy to mathematics. This means that Hegel's mathematized dialectic cannot be constructed deductively. The mathematized dialectic of Hegel cannot be constructed by analogy with mathematical logic. New approaches are needed.\n\nI hope that there will be mathematicians, physicists, philosophers, economists who want to continue this work.\n\nProfessor Ivan Bourbaki. Mathematician. Functional analysis, topology, game theory, and so on.",

One way that doesn't work is connecting the with a wire. Since the signal would travel at the speed of light, you can't use it to synchronize the clocks, and you can't account for the speed of light in calculations because that's what you're trying to measure.\n\nI chemistry class, we are learning about the quantum model. One thing that we learned about is quantum entanglement, and how it proves that information can be transferred instantly.\n\nOnce we understand quantum entanglement better and the technology that applies it improves, could we eventually use it to measure the one-way speed of light?\n\nIf so, that's sick.

A laser in a vacuum is invisible.  \n\nThe picture I have in my mind right now is this: take a single photon (which is a disturbance).
