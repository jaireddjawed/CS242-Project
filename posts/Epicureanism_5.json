        "text": "Sorry if it seems like i'm spamming with all my questions.. I have been interested in epicureanism for many years and just found this forum..\n\nSo something I have thought about and would like to hear opinions about.\n\nRegarding the epicurean saying \"Live unknown\" or \"Live unnoticed\" and today's internet world with social media.\n\nFor example. I am interested in weight lifting. Today if you look at internet forums etc regarding weight lifting it is very common with training journals where you post your training, YouTube channels where you post videos of your training, and so forth. This is just an example of social media activity.\n\nWhat would be the epicurean opinions regarding social media use like Instagram, YouTube etc? You don't live very unnoticed if you put out videos of yourself out there for the whole world to see, no?\n\nThis was of course not a subject in Epicurus time, so how should an follower of epicureanism think about this, do you think?\n\nI hope I made some sense.\n\nEDIT: I even forgot to mention Facebook..",

He ordained in his will annual memorial feasts for himself on the same date.\n\nI have a few questions about this: namely, why did Epicurus and his followers do this, do you modern Epicureans do it too, and could this kind of thing be similar to how Jesus became worshipped as the Son of God?",

        "text": "The Garden, Anonymity and Friendship\n\nIn the Garden, students pursued the course of spiritual and mental perfection.  Since Epicurus had outlawed myths, superstitions, and religious rituals the spiritual perfection sought by all students was conformity to the tenets of Epicurus with his emphasis on achieving peace of mind.  The school was a training ground in learning restraint and seeking the truth which freed the mind from fear and worry.  Always the aim was the same, to find happiness (eudaemonia) through the static pleasure of mental quietude (ataraxia).\n\nSeneca wrote: \"Go to the Garden and read the motto carved there:  'Stranger, Here you will do well to tarry; here our highest good is pleasure.' The caretaker of that abode, a kindly host, will be ready for you; he will welcome you with barley-meal and serve you water also in abundance, with these words: 'Have you not been well entertained?'  'This Garden,' he says, 'does not whet your appetite; it quenches it.'\" \n\nEducational studies at the Garden must have been conducted in a relaxed, non-competitive, leisurely pace.  Coercion, threats, or intimidation were antithetical to Epicurian philosophy which believed man has free will and must determine the conduct of his own life without supernatural intervention.  Students cultivated serenity of spirit in an atmosphere of leisure; under the tutelage of communal friends.\n\nThe Garden was a sanctuary from the activity of the city of Athens.  Epicurus and his students physically and mentally removed themselves from the active affairs of the city.  It is apparent that Epicurus mandated his followers to avoid most of the business, political, social and religious activities of Athenian life.\n\nEpicurus counseled: \"Live in anonymity, live in obscurity, live unknown, live unnoticed\" (lathe biosas).  The purest source of attaining security from men, which at times must be established by banishing life's disturbing elements, is secured by the quiet life and withdrawal from the mob.  We must free ourselves from the prison of business affairs and politics.  We must state the best way a man will reach the aim of a good life, and how no person would want to hold public office.  The scramble for public acclaim, the quest for riches and power threaten the security of an individual and attack his peace of mind.\n\nEpicureans turned their backs on the life of the metropolis to live in quiet serenity in the Garden.  The philospher believed that only in a congenial community of friends, living abstemiously, and devoting time to reflection and philosophical discussion could a student develop spiritual perfection, that is, eudaemonia via ataraxia (happiness through peace of mind).\n\nThe Epicurean fellowship looked upon friendship as the means by which members of the school could grow in philosophical maturity.  Recognizing that only an exceptional man like Epicurus could arrive at the realization of truth on his own, the membership strove together to find the true path.  By sharing social, emotional and intellectual experiences, the students grew in their understanding of the philosophy, as well as perfecting their self-realization.  The relationship shared by the members of the school proved their fidelity to one another and their total commitment to the Epicurean way of life.\n\nEpicurus and his followers lived in a brotherhood reminiscient of medievel monasticism.  The Garden was not an institution filled with the chants and liturgy of a religious society, but the members did break bread as a community of scholars working in joy to perfect their potential for happiness.  The purpose of the quiet, private school in the Garden was to free the mind of the pernicious influence of a corrupt and jaded society.  The Garden accepted female scholars as well as slaves, as the first educational institution to open its doors to all people.  It is likely that a number of other Epicurean garden philosophy schools were established throughout the Mediterranean area.\n\nFriends came from all parts of the world to live and study at the Garden.  The Garden was not a school where students worked toward academic degree or certificate, rather the result of their academic endeavors was the intangible reward of truth.  Evaluation for achievement of the cleansing derived from the words of truth was based on the student's own assessment of his progress.  Each student was free to use his own mind; he had the choice of accepting and living in conformity to the group creed, or he could reject part of the Epicurean system.  Epicurus expected friends wishing to receive the reward of ataraxia to follow his teachings, however he believed in freedom of choice and recognized that not all men would wish to follow the route to happiness that he prescribed.  He also suggested that men follow their own natural dispositions.\n\nA student would stay as long as he or she needed guidance in the search for self-discovery, self-realization, integration of personality, or when one was satisfied with the process of living on a level to bring personal fulfillment and happiness.  How does one know when selfhood has been reached?  Epicurus said that one knows when he is able to relate to others and to himself on a level that provides complete peace of mind.  The ideal is to live like the gods, who enjoy perfect peace and contentment and never let human affairs disturb them.  \n\nIn his Letter to Menoeceus, Epicurus wrote: \"Contemplate these and similar precepts day and night, both alone and with a friend, and you will never be disturbed while awake or asleep.  You will live like a god among men, for a man who lives in the midst of immortal blessings loses all semblance of mortality.\"  \n\nCondensed from \"Happiness Through Tranquility, The School of Epicurus\", Richard W. Hibler, 1984",

        "title": "Welcome to r/Epicureanism",
        "author": "ErraticVole",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Epicureanism/comments/4kru9p/welcome_to_repicureanism/",
        "text": "**Welcome to r/Epicureanism!** \n\nI’m sure you have a few questions. The foremost is probably “What the hell is Epicureanism, and why should I subscribe?” I’ve put together this introductory post to make the case for you becoming a follower of both this subreddit and the philosophy.\n\n**What is Epicureanism?**\n\nEpicureanism is an ancient philosophy based on the teaching of Epicurus of Samos (341-270BC). He based his thinking on a few simple physical principles and built from them an all encompassing philosophy. At its simplest Epicureanism can be summed up as the belief that ‘Pleasure is good, pain is bad.’ It is a misinterpretation of this which has led to Epicureans being painted as depraved pleasure seekers.\n\nEpicurus taught that pleasure is good and should be pursued, but that not all pleasures were worth getting. If a pleasure requires a lot of pain to reach, or gives pain in the long run, then it is foolish to go for it. On the other hand not all pains are to be avoided if they give pleasure in the long run. So while Epicureanism is a form of Hedonism it is a lot more contemplative than Hedonism is usually assumed to be. The careful weighing of the outcomes of our actions reveals which pains and pleasures we should introduce into our lives.\n\nThis sort of pleasure-calculation is only valuable however if we agree with Epicurus that pleasure is good and pain bad. How did he reach this conclusion?\n\n**What exists?**\n\nEpicurus was part of a tradition in Classical Greece of quasi-scientific thinkers. He based his notion of physics on those of the Atomists Leucippus and Democritus. All that existed, they and Epicurus taught, were atoms and the void they move in. All things that we can sense are productions of the movement and compounding of atoms.   \n\nEpicurus took this belief and applied it to the human soul. The mind is simply a product of atoms acting within us. On death these atoms disperse and the mind is thus broken up. There is not immortal soul which continues after death. This means that all our concerns should be with the life we lead before death.\n\nWhile Epicureans in the ancient world were, and still often are, called atheists Epicurus did believe in gods. These gods were made of atoms, exist within the universe, and take no interest in humanity. They live lives of complete tranquillity. This position, and the unusual nature of the Epicurean gods, does lend itself to atheism but is not a requirement of the philosophy. A theistic interpretation of Epicureanism is entirely possible.\n\n**What should we do?**\n\nThere were, and are, many answers to the question of how we should live our lives. A philosophy which aims to be complete must offer us guidance.\n\nEpicurus asked what motivates humans, all living things really. What makes us want to do something? Pleasure. What makes us not want to do something? Pain. We like pleasure. Since we are going to disappear on death we should focus on the things which make us happy. What is the point of living a virtuous life if it makes you miserable? You end up just as dead in the end.   \n\nEpicurus therefore rejected the idea of being beholden to society. He withdrew with his followers to a school called the Garden where they studied how to live the good life.\n\n**The Good Life**\n\nEpicurus separated our desires into categories. There are those that are:  \n*Natural and Necessary* – These are those that are required by life. Food, shelter, and the necessities of survival.  \n*Natural, but unnecessary* – These are those things that nature has shaped us for but that we can survive without. We might like drinking wine, but water serves just as well.  \n*Unnatural desires* – These are the ones that must be cultivated before we even desire them at all. Addiction to cigarettes would be an example, but so would any overly refined desire.  \n\nFor Epicurus our focus should be in filling those desires which are natural and necessary. We cannot avoid eating if we wish to live so we should take pleasure in simple fare that removes the pain of hunger. If you take pleasure in just removing the pain of hunger then you will not be disappointed when you don’t receive a three Michelin star meal.  \n\nBut it is natural to desire delicious food. It is in the realm of desires which are natural but not necessary that we have to train ourselves. We might want that world class chef to cook our meal but it is unlikely we will have it every day. We have to get used to not having it, but should it appear on our table we should take pleasure from it.   \n\nObviously unnatural desires should be scorned. Why? Because their removal causes pain. Can you guarantee that you will always have an adequate supply of your drug of choice? Anyone who has suffered a caffeine headache might warn people away from that addiction.  \n\nThis division of desires will tend towards the simple life. Epicureanism will not lead to riotous orgies (at least not all the time) but nor will it lead to asceticism. Pleasure is still good, you just have to take care with which ones you introduce to your daily life.\n\n**What else?**\n\nA short summary like this will never do credit to Epicureanism. The members of the subreddit have brought together a huge number of articles and posts which you should read. There are great overview articles on Epicureanism [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism), [here,](http://www.iep.utm.edu/epicur/) and [here.](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/) \n\nIn the sidebar you'll find links to some useful Epicurean websites that have interesting articles and the surviving Epicurean texts. \n\nIf you have any questions ask them here or make a self-post. The members of the sub are friendly. Epicurus placed huge importance on friendship. \n\n&gt; “Of all the means to insure happiness throughout the whole life, by far the most important is the acquisition of friends.”\n\nI’ll leave you with the message written over the entrance to the Garden which welcomed new members.\n\n&gt; Stranger, here you would do well to tarry; for here our highest good is pleasure.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Epicureanism/comments/4jrv7i/tetrapharmakos_the_four_part_remedy/",
        "text": "Tetrapharmakos, the Four Part Remedy\n\nThe Tetrapharmakos (τετραφάρμακος) \"four-part remedy\" is a summary of the first four of the Κύριαι Δόξαι (Kuriai Doxai, the forty Epicurean Principal Doctrines given by Diogenes Laertius in his Life of Epicurus). \n\nThe term \"tetrapharmakos\" originally meant a compound of four drugs (wax, tallow, pitch and resin).  The word was used metaphorically by Roman-era Epicureans to refer to the four remedies for healing the soul.\n\nDon't Fear the Gods\n\nEpicurus argued that the gods are distant, concerned about their own affairs, and do not care about the affairs of men.  Calamities such as fire, lightning, earthquakes, accidents and storms were natual phenomena, not divine retribution.  This teaching relieved people of superstitious belief that frequent prayers and sacrifices to the gods were necessary to avoid calamities.\n\nDon't Worry About Death\n\nEpicurus taught that there is no afterlife.  The spirit and soul are part of the body, and are physical material made of atoms.  When the body dies, the soul dies with it. \"Death means nothing to us...when we exist, death is not yet present, and when death is present, then we do not exist.\"   Fear of death is the greatest anxiety of all for most humans. This anxiety about death impedes the quality and happiness of one's life by the theory of afterlife: worrying about whether one's deeds and actions in life will deliver a judgment of eternity of pain or an eternity of pleasure.  Epicurus taught that the after-death experience was similar to one's condition prior to conception and birth: a state of nonexistance.  This teaching reduces the fear of death and the state of one's afterlife.\n\nWhat is Good is Easy to Get\n\nThe things that humans naturally need, such as sustenance and shelter, can be acquired by anyone with minimal effort, regardless of wealth. Those things which are more difficult to acquire are often not needed and in many cases are damaging to one's efforts to achieve happiness.  By reducing one's desires to a minimum of needs, one can maximize the satisfaction and happiness in one's life. When all of one's limited needs are fulfilled, and there are no unsatisfied desires, then one has reached the state of satisfaction with the minimum of effort.  This teaching reduces the fear of being destitute.\n\nWhat is Terrible is Easy to Endure\n\nThe Epicureans understood that in nature, illness and pain are not suffered for very long, for pain and suffering is either \"brief or chronic ... either mild or intense, but discomfort that is both chronic and intense is very unusual; so there is no need to be concerned about the prospect of suffering.\" One may overcome mild pain though mentally focusing on what is good and pleasant around one. Epicurus taught that to remain happy during periods of intense pain, one may recollect happier times with friends and trust that the pain will be temporary.  This teaching reduces the fear that people have regarding disease and prolonged suffering.\n\nBy applying the teachings of Tetrapharmakos, one can relieve much of the anxiety that afflicts the human soul.  The Tetrapharmakos provides a base of confidence that one can achieve happiness in life despite death, calamity, poverty or pain.  With this confidence, one can move forward in life choosing behavior and activities that promote one's happiness.",

Not the \"feasts and orgies\" type of pleasure promulgated by the Cyrenaics, the kind that revolves around a mild form of asceticism and enjoying the company of good friends, contemplation, and freedom from what causes you pain.\n\nEpicurus was not a total ascetic, many worldly goods were retained, which is reminiscent of Buddhism's Middle Way.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the highest state a Buddhist can achieve is nirvana, which is being free from desire. The Epicurean concept of aponia (absence of pain) is remarkably similar.\n\nEpicureans practice contemplation on what causes pain and suffering in the world around us. Buddhists do this too, only they call it meditation.\n\nThe only real difference I can think of is the supernatural elements of Buddhism. Epicurus rejected the supernatural as causing fear. Yet I am a secular Buddhist, so I don't see a problem here.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Are Buddhism and Epicureanism similar?",

        "text": "Hey folks,\n\nWe’ve pushed our summer read back a few weeks, so before we start Anthony Kenny’s ‘New History of Western Philosophy’, /r/PhilosophyBookClub is going to read and discuss Plato’s *Euthyphro* (for May 2) and *Meno* (for May 9). [**Here’s**](http://philosophyintroduction.weebly.com/uploads/4/4/6/2/44624607/plato_five_dialogues_second_edition.pdf) a PDF of both. Here’s a brief summary of the *Euthyphro*:\n\n&gt; Socrates inquires about Euthyphro’s business at court and is told that he is prosecuting his own father for the murder of a laborer who is himself a murderer. His family and friends believe his course of action to be impious, but Euthyphro explains that in this they are mistaken and reveal their ignorance of the nature of piety. This naturally leads Socrates to ask, what is piety?\n\n&gt; Besides being an excellent example of the early, so-called Socratic dialogues, Euthyphro contains several passages with important philosophical implications. These include those in which Socrates speaks of the one Form, presented by all the actions that we call pious (5d), as well as the one in which we are told that the gods love what is pious because it is pious; it is not pious because the gods love it (10d). Another passage clarifies the difference between genus and species (11e–12d).\n\nAnd a summary of the *Meno*:\n\n&gt; Meno wants to know Socrates’ position on the then much-debated question whether virtue can be taught, or whether it comes rather by practice, or else is acquired by one’s birth and nature, or in some other way.\n\n&gt; Having determined that Meno does not know what virtue is, and recognizing that he himself does not know either, Socrates has proposed to Meno that they inquire into this together. Meno protests that that is impossible, challenging Socrates with the “paradox” that one logically cannot inquire productively into what one does not already know—nor of course into what one already does! [One he solves this paradox,] Socrates advances and argues for a hypothesis of his own, that virtue is knowledge (in which case it must be teachable). But he also considers weaknesses in his own argument, leading to the alternative possible hypothesis... In the second half of the dialogue we thus see a new Socrates, with new methods of argument and inquiry, not envisioned in such “Socratic” dialogues as Euthyphro.\n\nAll the information is on /r/PhilosophyBookClub. I hope some of you will join us. Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nCheers\n\n(Thanks /u/ErraticVole for letting me post here.)",

Looking back on the happy milestones of my life they often follow a period of hardship. So although pleasure is desirable, perhaps a little bit of pain can make pleasure much more memorable.",

        "text": "Hey folks,\n\n/r/PhilosophyBookClub  is starting our summer read—Anthony Kenny’s ‘New History of Western Philosophy’—and I thought some of you might be interested in joining us. It’s about the most comprehensive history of philosophy you’ll find, and incredibly well-researched and well-written. I’m reading it to get a broader base before I start grad school, and I can’t imagine there’s anyone who wouldn’t benefit from the book, if you’re interested in the history of philosophy and the history of ideas.\n\nIt’s a thousand pages, but not a terribly difficult thousand pages. To make sure everyone can keep up, we’re spreading it over the full summer, so there will be around 60 pages of reading and at least one discussion thread per week.\n\nIf you haven’t heard of the book, here’s an excerpt from the publisher’s blurb:\n\n&gt; This book is no less than a guide to the whole of Western philosophy … Kenny tells the story of philosophy from ancient Greece through the Middle Ages and the Enlightenment into the modern world. He introduces us to the great thinkers and their ideas, starting with Plato, Aristotle, and the other founders of Western thought[, including substantial sections on the Epicureans]. In the second part of the book he takes us through a thousand years of medieval philosophy, and shows us the rich intellectual legacy of Christian thinkers like Augustine, Aquinas, and Ockham. Moving into the early modern period, we explore the great works of Descartes, Hobbes, Locke, Leibniz, Spinoza, Hume, and Kant, which remain essential reading today. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Hegel, Mill, Nietzsche, Freud, and Wittgenstein again transform the way we see the world. Running though the book are certain themes which have been constant concerns of philosophy since its early beginnings: the fundamental questions of what exists and how we can know about it; the nature of humanity, the mind, truth, and meaning; the place of God in the universe; how we should live and how society should be ordered. Anthony Kenny traces the development of these themes through the centuries: we see how the questions asked and answers offered by the great philosophers of the past remain vividly alive today. Anyone interested in ideas and their history will find this a fascinating and stimulating read.\n\nAnd the jacket-quote:\n\n&gt; \"Not only an authoritative guide to the history of philosophy, but also a compelling introduction to every major area of philosophical enquiry.\"\n\n&gt; —Times Higher Education\n\nI’m also hoping to do some primary-text readings, so if there’s anything you’d like to read or discuss that’s even tangentially related to the subject matter of Kenny’s book, we can make a discussion post for it when it comes up.\n\nWe’re reading the first section for May 2, and the full schedule is up at /r/PhilosophyBookClub. I hope some of you will join us, and if you have any questions, let me know.\n\n-Cheers\n\n(Thanks mods for letting me post here.)",
