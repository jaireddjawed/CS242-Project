        "text": "Let me start by saying that I am SEVERELY lactose intolerant. I take medication for this. How my meds work is I have to take them directly BEFORE I eat most dairy.\n\nI am sensitive to caffeine as well, as in too much makes me feel faint and dizzy. It does not give me the runs. Nobody in my family gets the runs from coffee. Which is a great thing. It actually has the effect of keeping us regular of anything.\n\nI have a crappy sleep schedule so I drink a coffee every morning and then go to work, where I drink my coffee. About an hour and a half later I poop and it’s always all good.\n\nWell last week I go to my regular coffee shop place my order with their stupid app that has trapped me into coming back all the time because I made gold status again and well it would be stupid to waste that.\n\nI order my coffee the way I always do. A venti soy white chocolate mocha frappe with two shot of espresso and no whip, like the weird coffee person I always said I’d never become. (Honestly I feel embarrassed that my drink order takes more than one breath to say for other people, but that’s the way I like my coffee. Also the soy is for the obvious reason of not being able to digest the dairy in cows milk. Even though the soy cost $0.50 more, but that’s the price to pay to not be in agony the rest of the day because that’s how bad my lactose intolerance is. $0.50 is more than worth it to me.)\n\nI pay for my coffee with the app and go to work where I drink my coffee.\n\n15 minutes later I know it wasn’t soy milk. I can feel a stabbing pain in my gut and my intestines came alive with all the horrors you feel when you are four seconds away from filling your pants with liquid shit!\n\nI shot out of my work area like a bullet and was in the bathroom stinking it up like a bad burrito from chipotle!\n\nI was doubled over in pain for the rest of the day. I threw up four times the pain and nausea was so bad.\n\nThis was not the peace my extra $0.50 bought me. This was an unholy revenge for all the smelly karma I had built up crop dusting my siblings!\n\nAfter the pain died down almost TEN HOURS after this all began, I go back to where I got the coffee to let the manager know.\n\nI explain what happened and they say they can refund my coffee from that morning and even give me a free coffee next time I order.\n\nI tell them I don’t want a refund because I drank the coffee and don’t feel ethical about that, and tell them I don’t want a free coffee all I want is for them to make the coffee the way I ask because as I said before I have severe lactose intolerance.\n\nI come back the next morning and order my coffee, feeling good and like there will be no problem.\n\nThey used regular cow milk again and forgot my two shots. I was still charged for the soy milk and two shots though.\n\nSo I go back in again and tell them about it again. I even tell them we went through this already yesterday.\n\nThey try to give me a refund and free coffee again.\n\nI say no to the free coffee and ask if instead of a full refund if I can just get refunded the cost of the soy milk and two shots. Because I did drink my coffee so I don’t want a refund for what I did consume, but now I don’t care about the ethics of a partial refund. I’ve worked in food before and when you do a weird partial refund like this it gets questions asked by corporate.\n\nQuestions like why did you refund them for the milk but not the whole drink? And when they find out someone was in agony for a majority of the day due to your foolishness it’s not gonna be a good thing for you!\n\nPlus I asked for corporate’s number, just Incase I decided to bring it to them myself.\n\nAnd I wasn’t going to go to corporate directly. That was just to scare them into making the drink the right way.\n\nI wasn’t gonna call corporate but guess what happens the next day.\n\nGuess!\n\nRegular milk again!!!!!!!!!!\n\nSo on my lunch break while I’m still in the thick of the pain and nausea and chocolate ass fountain.\n\nI call and I started by saying, “I am going to try to stay calm, but I just want to apologize in advance in case I go off the handle. This isn’t your fault. It is some idiot barista’s fault.” Then I told them about my lactose nightmare. And somehow I didn’t loose my shit with the lady on the phone, even if I was already dehydrated from loosing it out my ass.\n\nShe tried to give me a refund and a free drink, which I said no to, but I was happy to tell her which location was the source of my woes.\n\nAnd ever since then my coffee has been made with the soy milk I am paying for.\n\nAfter all that’s happened though I might just go somewhere else for my coffee. There is one even closer to where I work that is really good about this stuff. Right now though I’m just going back and forth on if I really want to waste my gold status for the year. I had to buy a lot of coffee to get there.\n\nEither way I just want to put this shit behind me. Aka post it to Reddit for yahl to read about. Because it’s just the funniest thing when I type it all out.",

The last time I ordered a hoagie, i wanted breaded chicken, tomatoe, and roasted veggies. I waited a solid 10 minutes to get it and left back to work. Once i got there and opened the hoagie I discovered they had failed to even put the chicken in it. The hoagie ended up consisting of tomatoe, cold veggies, and shredded lettuce i didnt ask for. There was hardly anything inside the roll either and looked very unappetizing. It was too late to even drive back to complain cause my break had 10 minutes left. ",

        "text": "Funny story from today, even though could have turned out tragically\n\nI am a regular at a chain steakhouse that serves amazing whole-wheat bread. I was there after working out today. I sat at the bar at a corner seat on the right. The bar was pretty packed, so that means on my L this girl and I were really seated really close together.\n\nWhen the steak came out, this waitress who brought out the plate went in between the girl and me, instead of taking of advantage of all the open real estate on my right to put down the steak.\n\nThe steak, the sides, and the plate fell onto my lap. What made the matter worse was for whatever reason they had a cup of A1 steak sauce on the plate, so things weren't pretty.\n\nThankfully, I had already put down the linen napkin on my lap after I got my drinks, so it took the brunt of the damage and hence my pants weren't completely ruined. **Remember, always use protection!** \n\nAlso, thankfully the plate and the steak weren't overly hot, or else we'd have a *boiled meatballs* situation in my pants, if you know what I mean.\n\nThe waitress and the 2 managers apologized profusely and offered me a soup or salad while I wait for my food to come out. I politely declined since I don't believe in salads (don't @ me) and the soup options sucked.\n\nGot my whole check comp'ed, and at the end of the meal I left a 20% tip as usual and I talked to one of the managers again and I jokingly told her that as a doctor, I'm more used to having bodily fluids to get on my scrubs pants than steak sauce and a steak!\n",

        "text": "I've had my share of bad customer experiences, but I tend to be forgiving because I've been on that side of the counter for many years. This is one of the few times that caused me to walk out and never go back.\n\nSo, furniture store. Commission-based. It's planted right in the middle of a popular area, so they must get a lot of foot traffic, more so than all the other places down the road anyway. My wife and I are looking for a sofa table (if you can't visualize one, it's just a long, thin table you can put behind a couch. No big deal). We've been to five places at this point, and no place has something that can match up with our style. So in we go, hoping to find something nice in espresso. I expect we'll walk in, browse around, and if we see anything we like, we'll ask about it.\n\nWe see a cluster of employees talking near a POS system, and they eye us. My wife and I are the only customers. We walk around, see a table, and chat about it for a minute. Then an older woman, a thin, matronly librarian type, walks up to us full of smiles and hand motions, and inserts herself into our conversation without even bothering to say hello.\n\nShe sees the table we're interested in and gives it a hard sell, and immediately talks about financing. Something about that really bugged me. I get that a fair number of people opt for monthly payments on furniture because they can't afford a lump sum, but to assume that about a person right off the bat is a serious no-no to me. Anyway, we tell her that we want to keep looking around before we decide, and that we'll come find her if we make a decision.\n\nShe backs off, and we move on. We find another table with a cool design. It's not the color we want and it has glass doors like a half-dresser, half cabinet kinda thing. The price is meh, and we both agree it's cool, but not for us. Immediately the librarian saleswoman is back just as we decide against it, and gives this one a hard sell, too. My wife tells her it's not for us, and we're prepared to look around more- but this saleswoman feels the need to complete her pitch instead of letting it go. I politely listen to her talk for several minutes about same-day delivery and the low rate they're offering for a 24-month payment plan. I purposefully let slip that we were looking to pay straight cash today, to get her to stop talking about financing. She backs off after another minute and my wife and I continue.\n\nWe look at another table. This one is in our color scheme, has a really nice finish and some cool detailing, but it's rather plain. We don't get in more than two sentences before librarian woman rushes in and starts talking about how it looks good in any room, repeats the same-day delivery option (not mentioning what it costs, just stressing that we could have it in our place that night), and *again* mentions financing. By now I am irritated, and my wife, who has far less patience, is visibly angry that we keep getting interrupted. How can we come to a decision if the saleswoman doesn't let us get in a few words between us? We tell her for a third time that we will *come and find her* when we see something we like. At this point it was the end of the day, this was our sixth furniture store we'd visited, we were getting tired of looking at tables, and this place actually had some nice ones we were considering. All this leech of a woman had to do was let us browse and talk, and we would have probably convinced ourselves to buy a damn table.\n\nShe inserted herself in the conversation one more time and gave her same-day, financing-available, everything they have looks good everywhere, super hard-sell again and we just turned around and walked out. \n\nI get that people working for commission live or die by the sales they land, but FFS, they shouldn't run off customers by being too pushy. Listen to what the they're saying. Drop the hard sell if it's not working. Stay at arm's length if people need space to make a decision.\n\nOh, and we found a table the next day, at an outlet place we discovered a few miles away. The salespeople there left us to wander, and we gave them a sale within twenty minutes. We've since visited that outlet place many times and bought like 7-8 pieces of furniture from them over the last 5 years at a total cost of like $7,000. Customers for life, basically, all because *they freaking listened to us*.",

I order from this place all the time, and there are very rarely any problems, and when there are, a quick text clears it up.\n\nToday I ordered breakfast, and watched the guy go to the place where his map takes him. I sent him a text that contained the same information from the delivery note, since he clearly didn't read it. I gave him the exact intersection of my place, and the exact name of the complex I live in. \n\nHe sends me a text that says \"You know, this would be great information for you to include in your delivery notes.\"\n\nI replied, \"I did.\" \n\nSo I was already dreading this. \n\nHe gets lost AGAIN and I have to give him several instructions on how to get in. At this point, I again give him my exact building number, and tell him I'll be outside waiting and what shirt I am wearing. \n\nHe takes another five minutes, having not listened to my instructions. Then as soon as he pulls up (screeching to a stop and nearly hitting another car in the lot) he immediately starts berating me:\n\n\"I don't live here you know, it would have been great of you to include the color of the building so I could find the place\"\n\nHe's being pretty aggressive so I just mutter \"Fuck you, dude,\" and walk away with my food. I admit, this was not the best response on my part, but he was just bitching me out despite me giving him all the help I could.\n\nThen, he starts SHOUTING at me out his window the whole time I'm walking back to my house. \n\nI caught some obscenities but was mostly trying to hurry back inside because I was feeling really anxious.\n\nIn a conversation with customer service, I let them know: \"I work customer service. If I ever said 'fuck you' to a customer, I'd be fired on the spot, even if they said it first. So, I would expect him to get fired, but if not... are you hiring? Because I would love a job where I could curse out customers.\" \n\nPRE-EMPTIVE DEFENSIVE:\n\nI know some of you guys will defend this guy because I said \"fuck you\" first. Fine. EVEN WITHOUT me saying that, even before I did so, his customer service was unacceptable. \n\nI've had customers say \"fuck you\" to me before, and usually I'm actually able to calm them down, but at the very least I have the decency not to SHOUT back at them.",

I’ve told it before on AskReddit but didn’t discover this sub until recently, so if it sounds familiar, that’s why.\n\nMy dad died 3 days before Christmas of 2015. The day after he passed, I went out shopping for a dress to wear to the funeral service. \n\nI worked in customer service at the time, so I knew firsthand how important it is to not take your own personal turmoil out on retail workers.\nWhile being rung up, the cashier was making small talk with me, asking me how I was doing, etc. I engaged with her just as I normally would — putting aside the fact that the worst day of my life happened less than 24 hours ago. You know what she said to me? \"I really like your attitude!” Just like that, completely out of the blue. \nI asked her to elaborate what she meant (and thanked her for the compliment), and she explained that most people who came by were noticeably agitated or stressed out; the holiday season tends to do that to people, but she told me I seemed like a really positive, endearing person, and she appreciated the warm energy I was giving off. \n\nIt was definitely bittersweet, but I still fondly look back on what she said to me and how it made me feel. Having a bad day is no excuse to make other people's days worse — being kind and polite will make you feel much better when all is said and done!\n\nThe store has since gone out of business, but I think about that cashier all the time and I wish she knew how much of an impact she made on me that day.",

I only have my college ID, is that okay?\" \nSG: \"Absolutely not, how do I know that it's not fake, you might not actually be in college.\"\nBf: \"Look man, here's my ID, she's a month younger than me, I have my college ID on my as well\"\nSG: \"I can't let her in until I see proper identification to prove she is over 16\"\nMe: \"Are you kidding me? I’m 19 going on 20, I have my college ID on me, I have my insurance card, my debit card, my car insurance card..I just don't have my damn license\"\nSG: \"Nope. Sorry. Mall policy. After 5 PM on the weekends we cannot let minors unaccompanied into the mall\"\nMe storming away: \"I’M NOT A MINOR\"\n\n*Bf and I walk to another entrance in the mall*\n\nNew SG: \"Hey guys have a good evening\"\n*Lets us into the mall without asking for an ID*\n\nAbout an hour or so later after we've been shopping another SG stops us and asks to see our IDs. I explain what happened at the front door, show her my college ID, she threatens to kick us out of the mall, I started getting visibly upset, another SG walks over and tells the girl to let us go we're clearly not minors. S/O to that guy. \n\nWhen we got home I called the security office and complained about the way they treated me. The manager apologized profusely and they mailed me a $15 mall gift card. I learned my lesson and now always have my license when I go to the mall. Worst part of all of this is the SGs who demanded IDs were either our age or a year younger. \n\nEdit: So a lot of people are saying it's on me for not having the proper identification with me, and I get that, but hindsight is 20/20. I had gotten my license renewed the day before this ordeal because it had expired roughly 2 weeks prior. In my state they issue you a paper license (literally 8.5x11 piece of paper) until your new one comes in the mail 3-6 weeks later. Because we had taken public transportation, I didn't feel the need to carry around my papers. When we got to the mall we ran into a group of our friends, all 19-21, and when they walked in less than a minute before us, nobody was ID'd. I understand they have the policy for a reason, whether it be loitering teens, gang activity, or abductions, but I think it is a bit flawed. We were ID'd by 2 guards who were easily our age, but 2 older guards didn't bother to ID us. We weren't causing any problems, yet were still stopped. Again hindsight is 20/20, but it was annoying that we weren't going to be allowed to shop simply because a guard didn't think I was over 16, which is ridiculous to me because I’m clearly over 16. ",

Obviously, I'm replacing the names.\n\nI titled this 4-day tire replacement, but I think the whole process took over a week. I was without my car for four days\n\n~\n\n\nHello, \n\n[introduction, my name, etc]\n\nI've been working with Diddlydumb in regards to my vehicle. The first appointment that I showed up for, which was for routine maintenance, they had no record of. This caused me to have to wait a long time in the dealership while we got everything sorted out. The appointment took hours, which I assumed was because I asked them to look into my radio issues. I believe, however, that some of the delays may have been because they apparently didn't know I was coming despite my having a confirmation email, because after six hours, all they had done was determine there was a circuit shortage in my radio.\n\nI found out they didn't rotate my tires because I needed new ones. Diddlydumb quoted me at just under $500 for a set of new tires, which I told him I needed to think about before purchasing. I eventually decided to get my tires there, since I never had a really bad experience with that dealership and I trusted not to have any issues. I called Diddlydumb on Monday at noon to schedule a Wednesday appt.\n\nI showed up Wednesday only to find out they didn't know I'd had an appointment again, and despite telling Diddlydumb on Monday morning that I was coming in for new tires, he didn't order them. It took about 20 minutes into what I thought would be a quick dropoff for him to find out what tires I needed. Luckily I showed up 30 mins early for my scheduled appointment, because two other people were scheduled at my time and I would have had to wait on them and it would have taken longer. In fact, he didn't seem to remember quoting me $500 and told me it'd be closer to $600. Since they already had my car and were replacing my radio that day, I said it was fine. \n\nHowever, I get a call at 4:30pm informing me that the tires that should have been ordered Monday at noon, but were apparently not ordered until some point after 11 on Tuesday, did not arrive. Diddlydumb assured me that morning that they would arrive in time for the end of the day. So now I could come pick up my car but I'd have to bring it back AGAIN in the morning. I decided to leave it overnight after he assured me it'd be ready first thing in the morning. I thought this would ensure it got done quicker.\n\nI called at nearly 11 this morning because I hadn't heard anything, and Diddlydumb lets me know that the technician didn't show up to work on my tires, so apparently they didn't assign a new one until nearly 11am. He let me know that my car would be ready in an hour, which was cutting it close but would be just in time for me to get to work. \n\nAt the time of sending this email, it has been nearly 2 hours and I still do not have my car, have no way of getting to work, no way to pick up my car until tomorrow, and have basically decided I am done with [dealership] after this terrible experience. I have had nothing but good experiences in the past here, but I can't describe this experience as anything other than incompetent, chaotic, inconsiderate, and frustrating.\n\nThank you,\njitterbun\n\n\n~\n\nA bit of background. My mother (the owner of the car (although I'm currently buying it from her)) emailed as well regarding this issue the night before. I was a bit annoyed about that (I'm a grown up and can handle my own stuff, mom! lol) I sent this email just before I got a call saying my car was ready. When I came in, Diddlydumb confronted me:\n\nD: \"Your mom wasn't mad, was she?\" \nMe: \"I don't know... it's been a very difficult experience.\"\nD: \"Oh, well I hope she's not mad.\"\nMe: \"I don't think either of us are happy.\"\n\nI am not very good at face to face confrontation, which is why I stick to emails. I also like everything said to be on record. \n\nBut get this: THE DEALERSHIP NEVER GOT BACK TO ME. I emailed again later on, just to express that I was disappointed with the lack of response, but I guess they didn't care because I said I wasn't coming back. :/\n\nI was kind of hoping for a good apology, cos this dealership is literally within walking distance of my house, and it's so so convenient. I actually ended up going back one more time when one of the TIRES THEY SOLD ME, BLEW OUT three months later. And that...\n\nThat's a whole other story.",

        "text": "It’s been a really trying week car wise. My wife and I are moving out of state for the first time in our adult lives. My wife has lived in the same 5-10 mile radius her entire life, and I’ve lived in the same city since I was ten. This has been a stressful time in our lives. We bought a new house in our new state and sold our home in our hometown with little to no issues. It’s gone remarkably smooth. We packed up the truck with all our belongings and wave goodbye as it took off, filled up the car, lock up the house for the last time, and secured our most precious cargo, two little ones both under the age of 5 in the back. It’s late afternoon going on early evening. We’re staying at a hotel in town for the night before heading off the next morning. This is where our sorted tale begins.\n\nMy wife and I have a car that’s made by a manufacturer that rhythms with Bored. We’ve had it for five years and haven’t had any issues with it. That is until we are ready to leave for our long journey to a new far away home. I get in the front seat and push the start button. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. The battery is completely dead. We call our local Bored dealership where we get it serviced regularly. I get someone on the phone and try to explain the situation. I’ll be ME and he’ll be BG (Bored Guy).\n\nMe “My battery is completely dead. Do you guys have some that might be able to give us a jump? I have jumper cables in my trunk but it won’t open.”\n\nBG “We don’t have a service like that but I can give you the number of Bored’s roadside assistance.”\n\nMe “Great! We are driving to New State tomorrow, do I need a new battery or will getting a jump and driving it a while do the trick?”\n\nBG “I think you should bring it in and let us have a look if you are driving that far, just be safe. It’s just a battery, it’s a quick fix.”\n\nMe “Ok, will do. Do we need an appointment? We have a long drive tomorrow and want to get on the road.”\n\nBG “Nope. No appointment needed, just stop on by and we’ll swap it out.”\n\nHe gives me the number and I call roadside assistance. After I enter all the info and I get a text to confirm my location and a reply text saying I get service WITHIN 60 minutes. Ok, not too bad right? Wrong. At the 60 minute mark I get a robo call saying my service has been assigned and someone will be there in 20 minutes. No one shows. I get another call asking if someone showed up, I say no. They call the provider and say that someone is en route and will be there in 20 minutes. This goes on for 2 full hours. Someone is always “15-20 minutes away”. I even called the provider myself and a guy said he was looking at his screen and sees his employee’s GPS location and he’s one exit up on the freeway and will be there in you guessed it, 15-20 minutes. Eventually someone shows up. My kids are tired and hungry. It’s now pitch black outside. While waiting we talked with neighbors, no one had jumper cables handy. It just seemed like bad luck, but we got our car jumped finally and went to the hotel. We got late night room service and let the kids relax way past their bedtime. Tomorrow would be a better day, right? Wrong again.\n\nThe next morning we get up kinda late. With packing and car trouble it had been a long day so we slept in a little later than we wanted, but we had a long day of driving ahead of us so it seemed like the smarter play. We get up and grab a quick breakfast, the car starts up thankfully, and we head to Bored dealership for hopefully a quick battery swap and we can get going.\n\nWe pull into the service department, get the kids out and let them know we’re here. I take the kids to the waiting area and my wife heads over to a cubicle looking thing to do the paperwork and pay. Five minutes later she comes into the waiting area nearly in tears. She’s shaking she’s so upset and asks me to deal with it. Confusing, but no problem, I’ll get it sorted. I go into the cubicle. From there I can see my car has been pulled into a service bay and the hood is up. I talk with the lady behind the desk. She says they can do it at 12:45 (it’s maybe 10:45am). I ask why so long? She says it’s because we didn’t have an appointment. I explain the situation and what we were told last night. She says she’ll talk with the technicians and see what they can do. She's fairly rude. Like asking her any questions is not allowed. I can now see why my wife is upset. She asks if I wanted a new battery or if I wanted them to just charge my old battery.\n\nMe “I don’t know. Is the old battery bad? Does it need to be replaced? We’re driving out of state as soon as this is done and I don’t want to be stranded.”\n\nService Lady “Well I guess that’s up to you.” She leaves to talk with the technicians.\n\nI’m starting to get annoyed now. The head technician comes in (HT).\n\nHT “You have two choices. We can service your car when we can, or you can take it back and do whatever you want with it.”\n\nI lose my cool. I ask HT if the battery needs to be replaced, he also doesn’t give me a straight answer. I tell them to give me a new battery. He says they’ll get to it after lunch. Apparently at this establishment lunch ranges anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. By now the old battery had been pulled, but they couldn’t finish it before lunch (it’s now 11am and lunch starts at 11:30). Now I’m not the most mechanical inclined person, but it seems like they’d done half the work, despite telling me I needed to wait a least a couple of hours to get my car back. I felt defeated, and returned to waiting room and told my wife what was going on. She’s still very upset with how they’ve treated us and talked to us. Everyone has been rude and treated us like an annoyance. A few minutes go by and a man comes up to us and asks to talk with us in his office. I go alone. \n\nFeels important to mention here that we’ve been taking both our Bored cars here for years, despite the lackluster service. Their Yelp reviews are a constant 1 star, but we’ve never really had any issues only needing basic maintenance.\n\nTurns out the guy is Bored Guy from last night! I think to myself, “finally, this guy was nice to us on the phone last night and knows our plight! Problem solved!”\n\nRon Howard narrator voice, “It wasn’t.”\n\nBG sits down and starts asking me what the issue was. I recount our tale from last night quickly and how we are just trying get the battery swapped out so we can be on our way.\n\nBG “Well you didn’t have an appointment.”\n\nMe “You said we didn’t need one. That is was just a battery and should be a quickly done.”\n\nBG “Yeah, when we do the service it takes 20-30 minutes. But I never said we’d do it as soon as you arrived.”\n\nMe “We based on what you said last night, that is the impression I got. We’re moving out state, we’re leaving as soon as this is done. I thought it was clear we needed this done quickly.”\n\nBG “You never said anything about moving.”\n\nI lose my cool again. \n\nMe “YES I DID! It’s a critical detail. My wife can verify, she was sitting next to me when I said it.”\n\nBG “Well, I invited you down here on the phone last night to try and help you out. I never said we’d do it immediately. We’re open till 7pm, we’d have taken care of it today. Everyone takes lunch at 11:30. They can’t work past that.”\n\nBy now steam from probably coming out of my ears, but I trying to keep my composure. \n\nMe “I understand that. But you Head Technician was an asshole and no one can seem to tell me if I need a new battery or not. Seems like a pretty simple yes or no question.”\n\nBG “Don’t you think you’re being unreasonable? You expect to just drop in and have us immediately work on your car without an appointment? I also don’t appreciate you you calling my employee an asshole.”\n\nMe “Based on what you said on the phone last night and that it’s seems like a pretty simple thing to change a battery, I don’t think I’m being unreasonable. I told you our situation and you made it seem like you’d help us out quickly. We came here because it. And your employee was being a jerk and giving crappy service.”\n\nBG “You don’t think you’re being unreasonable?”\n\nI get the impression he wants me to admit I’m being unreasonable and\\or apologize. By now I’m never going to do that, Bored has let us down at every turn at this point.\n\nI reply with a simple and calm, “No.”\n\nBored Guy turns bright red in the face and jumps out of his chair and flings the door open with all his might. I think he may have broken it. On his way out he yells, “FINE! TAKE YOUR CAR  SOMEWHERE ELSE THEN!” He has his technicians work past the magical 11:30am mark to PUT THE OLD BATTERY BACK IN. While this is going on I tell my wife the news. Google a car battery place. There is one just down the street. I call and they tell me to come on down and they’ll have it done in 30 minutes or less. We collect our car and head down the street. \n\nTrue to their word they swap out the battery in 30 minutes. The guy on the phone was waiting for me outside as I pulled up and started work immediately. As they are ringing me up and I’m paying I tell them my tale summarized. \n\nThe new battery guy tells me the get a lot of business that way. By now I’m not shocked by that statement.\n\nLet’s but a bow on this shit sandwich shall we?\n\nMe “yeah, it’s weird the battery died. we just had that car serviced.”\n\nThe two guys behind the counter, both had worked on my car, looked at each other with raised eyebrows and very surprised expressions.\n\nNew Battery Guy “How long ago did you get it serviced?”\n\nMe “Couple of months ago, 3 at the most. Why?”\n\nNew Battery Guy “There was a lot of corrosion one of the terminals. That’s clear sign the battery needs to be replaced. The amount would have been building up for a long time, it would have been clearly visible when your car was serviced. Any car tech, even their first day on the job, with a flashlight would have known that battery needed to be replaced.”\n\nRemember how I said I had been taking my car to that same Bored service center for years? Yeah, they serviced it just a couple of months ago. They should have changed it back then. My battery had been a its last legs for months.\n\nI buy a portable battery charger from New Battery Guy to give him the extra business, their service couldn’t have been faster or friendly. We felt heard and taken care of the first time since this long dark odyssey began. We finally got on our way and arrived in our new state. \n\nBut not without one more car trouble tale. That’s a story for another time.\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, thanks for letting me vent! Moving alone is stressful enough, but this really took the cake. I’ll never by another Bored again.\n\nTL:DR Car battery died as we are leaving to move out of state. Had to wait three hours for a jump despite everyone being only 15-20 away. Dealership is beyond rude and really upset my wife, eventually puts our old battery back in and tells us to leave because I won’t admit I'm being unreasonable for wanting my car serviced quickly based on the impression they gave over the phone, and should have been content with them getting to it sometime that day.\n\nedited: for grammar and clarity.",

I told him what a I wanted and headed for the washroom. By the time I had got back and found him our order has been placed. He was right against the counter area waiting for it. As I hate crowds I hung back to the side of the line area. Then I saw it. The one lady making bagels leaned forward and motioned her head to my SO. The other woman working across from her looked at him and smiled. As the sandwich lady handed off an order to the woman on the second til she held the bagel and whispered something so her. Again eyes on my SO. Having worked in the same type establishment I understood the message was \"check out the hot guy.\" I laughed to myself as all these women made not-so-secret goo-goo eyes at him. I sent him a text telling them they were all checking him out. When our order was completed the woman handing it to him was all huge smiles. After he found me and tried to tell me they weren't. As I explained to him everything I saw I opened the bag to check the order. All the food was actually for me. There were 4 free hash browns in the bag. I just looked at him with an \"orly\" kind of look. Checked my bagel - he forgot to order tomato on it. Partly because I love tomato and partly because I couldn't resist I went back to the counter and asked them to add the tomato. As soon as they fixed it I turned around to see my SO standing right behind me. He asked very loudly \"ready to go Hun?\". I wish I had eyes on the back of my head to see what their reaction was. \n\n\nBack in the car and on the road I enjoyed my bagel and the hash browns his lovely face had acquired. \n",

I have blonde hair, so the strands aren't thick, but I have a LOT of hair. I lose combs in there sometimes. It's wavy and just... a lot. I didn't even know I had an abnormal amount before this experience.\n\nI just wanted a cute bun updo and I went to a pretty cheap place to do it, several hours before prom (not a walk-in, I scheduled an appt). I told the lady on the phone that my hair was pretty long, just so it wouldn't be a surprise or anything. \n\nThis lady is doing my hair, and she's not super friendly, so it's a little awkward, and she says in a voice that's kind of annoyed, \"You have a lot of hair.\" \n\nMy dumbass just replies: \"Oh, I'm sorry.\"\n\nI was gonna tip her extra because by the sounds of her huffing and puffing, my apparent crapton of hair was extremely annoying to deal with. But then, when another employee walks by and they're briefly catching up, this lady says.\n\n\"This is taking forever. There's so much of this crap.\"\n\n\"This crap\" being my hair. I felt really bad that my hair was difficult but I thought that was really unprofessional. I also felt bad because maybe I was just a hormonal teen but that really hurt my feelings back then, even though it wasn't even really an insult. Now, I always joke about it when someone comments on how thick my hair is.\n\nI imagine she was also stressed due to prom and how busy it was, potentially teens who don't understand tipping etiquette, but still.

Now this family, they were buying a buttload of laundry soap. No exaggeration, it was two cart fulls of laundry soap and dryer sheets, and they had a coupon for EVERY SINGLE ONE. They also felt the need to argue with the cashier about how much the coupon was taking off the overall total, to the point where she was scanning and rescanning items and coupons multiple times until they were happy and paid. All in all it took about 10 minutes from when we got in line until they finished the last transaction. \n\nWhen it was our turn, the cashier told us that family had been there for HOURS and insisted on coming through her line each time. They even went as far as asking what her schedule was so they could come back another day to do something similar since they trusted her. \n\nOh boy was she annoyed. She kept ranting to us about how no one needs that much laundry soap, and that the people who buy those in bulk are the worst because they are so selfish about their purchases. At the end she didn’t charge us for the bags we used and discounted some of the items already on clearance to thanks us. But man did I feel so bad for her, I don’t know how she did it. Luckily she said she was off soon. ",

But hey, I’m not gonna say no!\n\nEdit: 2nd oil change for my car since I bought it, I’m not typically that clueless ",

My ex had dropped said company's phone in the toilet, and even after a few days in a bag of rice, no luck turning the phone back on, so off to their store we go. I will add that she had the warranty on the phone which allows the phone to be replaced for free for any hardware malfunctions but was voided for any and all water damage, and at the time would have cost her roughly $500. I will be **M**, my ex will be **F** and **CSR** for the kind lady who helped us.\n\n**CSR**: Hello, how can I help you today?\n**F**: I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet and it won't turn on. I have the warranty but it's not valid in this case so I was wondering if I can just get a new phone?\n**CSR**: May I see the phone? I'll bring it to the back and take a look inside it.\n*Heads to the back room to check inside the phone and comes back with a smile.*\n**CSR**: So I checked the water markers in the phone and none indicate any water entered the device, *(looking at my ex)* are you sure you dropped it in the toilet?\n**F**: Yes, I'm positive! It was an accident but it definitely fell in and was completely submerged.\n**CSR**: Hmmmm... *(looking at me now, winking)* Are you sure there's water damage in the phone?\n**M**: *(now catching on to what she's trying to do)* No no, of course there's no water damage, one morning the phone just stopped working and we're not sure why.\n**CSR**: Yes, that's what I had thought. Well then, let me set you up over here and get you your free replacement.\n\nTo this day, I will never forget the kindness of that woman in that moment. We had lucked into the situation with regards to no apparent water damage but she certainly didn't have to do that.",

        "text": "This is way too long and I'll honestly be surprised if anyone bothers reading this, haha.\n\nI started going to this hair salon by my university a couple of years ago because they're cheap,and I like the work that the owner does. I like the place so much that I end up recommending it to my friend, and we go in together. \n\nI just wanted my hair dyed dark, and she wanted her hair bleached and dyed pink, if I remember right. Owner did my hair, and one of his stylists, whom I'll call Lady because I'm not creative, did my friend's. \n\nMy hair turned out great, and my friend liked her hair at first, but once we got out of there and into different lighting, we noticed that the dye job wasn't actually that good. I asked my friend if she wanted to go back that day and she told me she didn't, that it was fine, and she'd fix it herself. I thought that was stupid because she'd paid for the dye job, but whatever. My only personal issue with the place is that Owner didn't really listen to what I wanted for my hair. If I asked for straight bangs, he'd tell me that would look bad on me and go on and on until I agreed to side bangs because he's the expert. \n\nA few weeks later, I need my bangs trimmed (and I want to try and fight for straight bangs again), and the same friend wanted to dye her hair silver now. She said we should go to the same place, and just both request Owner to do our hair instead of Lady. My friend makes the call to schedule the appt and requests specifically that we don't get Lady. For some reason Owner doesn't want to do both of us and says that he'll put my friend with Blady. I say Blady because my friend thought he'd said a different name, but when we arrived it turned out he'd put her with Lady again. \n\nWe were under the impression that we would have our hair done at the same time, but as Lady gets started on my friend's hair, I just sit there and watch Owner text on his phone doing nothing. I was confused, and eventually asked if my appointment was still at 3:30 (it was now about 4:15) and Lady explains that she's doing both mine and my friend's hair. Which I'm not thrilled about but whatever.\n\nWhile she's working on my friend's hair, Lady complains about the shoddy dye job and that \"this is so uneven. You should always go to a professional.\" My friend and I make eye-contact; we don't want to tell Lady that SHE'S the one who dyed it. \n\nThey (Lady and Owner) also kind of gang up on my friend when she asks for silver hair. They tell her that's impossible, and she says fine, then she wants to go for white. They say that's fine but then they keep going on and on kind of aggressively about how doing silver hair is impossible. Weird.\n\nThen, when it's my turn, the first thing Lady does is ask me how old I am. I already knew why; I'm 22 years old and have some shiny silver hairs sprouting. I just bought my first house, so I always joke that I just started stressing out early. (also covering up my insecurity with a humble brag. win.) I jokingly told her \"Oh yeah, those are my pretty silver unicorn hairs!\"\n\nAnd she goes, in this really straight voice, \"Those aren't silver, they're gray.\"\n\nUm ouch, that doesn't sound as nice. I'm actually really insecure about them but I try to laugh it off, but the Lady keeps on in this rude, snotty voice: \"Do you want me to cover those? Because they're like, really obvious.\" \n\nMe: \"Oh, um, I don't mind them so much. I just have money to get my bangs trimmed today\"\n\n\"You sure? Because it looks kind of weird especially because you have bangs.\" \n\nMy friend, who knows how kind of insecure the silver unicorn hairs have made me, goes \"I think they're beautiful and you are the most magical fairy unicorn\" and we cheer up from there. I tell Lady to just give me straight bangs and thankfully she doesn't argue, and we get out of there without incident (other than the bill which was way higher than what their chalkboard indicated, but we assumed it was cos they did some extra stuff (without asking us). \n\nThen, my friend notices in the car that while the top of her head is a pretty white color, her hair is a brassy yellow. It looks kind of awful. I'm not really sure if that's to be expected, cos I know sometimes you have to bleach your hair several times before it lifts, but I think they have a way to keep it from looking super yellow and weird. I don't know if that's a complaint or just to be expected, haha.\n\nBut I'm not gonna lie, every time I look in the mirror and see those silver hairs I hear Lady saying \"they're like, really obvious\" even though everyone tells me they're not. I'm not big on hair dye and stuff so I haven't tried to cover them myself cos I'm nervous, but I'm not a big fan of Lady for calling me out, lol. \n\nTL;DR: Hair stylist unknowingly insults her own dye job and then uncaringly insults the customer, and charges $180 for it.",

        "text": "Last week I was supposed to leave on a trip to London with the rest of my family. The trip had been planned for months, with hotels and tickets to a soccer game paid for. \n\nMy flight was delayed to 10:20 pm and due to the hour and a half I had to drive to the airport, I arrived at 8:40 (cutting it close I know, but I had worked prior). As I walked into the (international) airport I saw no one at any ticketing desk, at 8:40 pm when there were still departures scheduled after my flight. I asked a man who was picking up signs where everyone was and he told me that they “closed up shop for the night”, at 8:40 pm, at an international airport. \n\nAfter 15 minutes of confusion and trying to find assistance, I picked up the courtesy phone to have the ticketing agents paged because I was soon to be reaching the cut off time to check in (60 minutes prior). After almost 40 minutes and 3 pages over the speakers, no one had come to help. I was paged to the phone and the lady told me that she had spoken with this Airlines gate agent (also the ticketing agents, somehow) and they said they were going to begin boarding in 20 minutes (which means the flight had been delayed further) and they would come to book me for the flight the next day after. As I hung up the phone, I waited and tried to get someone to help me get me and my bag on the plane (I had to check it because it won’t fit through the X-ray at tsa). After waiting for 30 minutes it was now almost 10 pm and I heard someone on the intercom say “the last call for boarding on flight xxx to London) while I’m still in the ticketing area waiting. At this point, I was obviously over this whole fiasco and a man who worked at he airport walked up to me and said he heard what was going on and he was going do his best to help me.\n\nSo this guy and I take off towards TSA. As we get to TSA (it’s almost exactly 10 pm) the TSA agent is closing a gate and says “sorry, we’re closed”. What do you mean you’re closed? There are still flights leaving after mine, what about those people? She didn’t care, she said then you should’ve been here sooner. Well great, shit out of luck. The flight ended up not leaving until 11 pm and no one showed up to rebook me afterward. So I end up driving back home that night and get on the phone with the airline the next day. The woman on the phone told me that it was my fault and I should have been there 3 HOURS before my flight as they recommend; however, I know the rule is 60 minutes. After doing my best to not argue with this woman she says that there’s nothing she can do and offers to transfer me to another department for some reason. Get on the phone with her boss and he said the same thing, to which I responded: “I’m looking at your website, it doesn’t say 3  hours anywhere on here”. This went on for almost 2 hours and 4 different people, and they refused to give me anything back and they canceled my reservation. So here I am I’m out $1700, and missed out on the whole trip. \n\n",

        "text": "I used to occasionally order from an online retailer that donates a portion of their proceeds to charity. This is the story of why I refuse to place another order with them. It was quite the hassle and went on for awhile so I will try to keep it short as possible.\n\nIn September of 2015, I ordered a couple of shirts from the company.  They mentioned in the order confirmation that they were having some issues with fulfillment but expected orders to be shipped out within 4 weeks. \n\nIn October of 2015, I had earmarked a couple of other shirts for purchase but decided to send an e-mail asking about my first order. Got a form e-mail stating they are taking multiple days to respond due to a high volume of questions to their support team. Ended up going forward with the second order before hearing back.\n\n9 days later, I finally hear back. Basically a form e-mail apologizing, fulfillment issues etc. Offered me a 20 percent discount. I requested this be applied to my second order, which they did.\n\nA month later, requested an update. 2 weeks later, basically the same form e-mail, but advised us to read a blog post they had posted about the issues. I do that, it promises that all orders should be shipped 4 weeks after the holidays.\n\nJanuary of 2016, I ask for another update. Nothing. Over the next 3 months, I sent numerous e-mails, but never got ANY response from them other than the form e-mails or a “we have received your e-mail and will be responding soon.”\n\nFinally in April of 2016, I get an e-mail apologizing for the issue and promising a 30 percent refund would be mailed out within 7 business days.\n\nA few days later, I get a shipping notification for order 1. Only 7 months later, but yay.\n\n2 days later, shipping notice for order 2. \n\nA few days later, I check and notice that there has been no movement in two weeks on the first order, so ask for an update.\n\nI finally get a package in mid April. According to the outside, it contains order 2. However, once I open it up, it contains the shirts from my first order. Now I’m really freaking out, thinking I’m going to end up getting the same order twice. So I e-mail again.\n\nBy June of 2016, I’ve e-mailed them at least 7 separate times about this issue. NO response, still no sign of order 2, and oh yeah, no refund. \n\nEnd of June, I try their live chat option. All I’m told is that my info will be forwarded onto shipping, and will be in touch with me ASAP.\n\nEnd of August, I’m still sending e-mails and have yet to hear back from them again.\n\nFinally in September of 2016 (a YEAR from when I placed the first order), I track down an e-mail for one of the co-founders of the company and e-mail him. \n\nA couple weeks later, I’m now finally getting answers. My order is resubmitted. A week later, I finally get shipping info. Of course, until I see movement on it, I’m still concerned which I mention. Co-founder/chairman promises me a gift pack for my patience. \n\nFinally, Oct 20 of 2016, I have all of my shirts and my orders are completed. However, I still want to know about this gift pack and refund I was promised so I reach out again.\n\nNovember of 2016, I get an order confirmation on the gift pack. Nothing about the refund.\n\nAt this point, I have stopped caring. I got the shirts that I paid for. The gift pack was just some stickers. I’m not 5. I don’t care about stickers. I’m done. I give up.\n\nOut of curiosity, I logged onto the site today. My sticker order is still showing as unfulfilled 18 months later. Yeah. \n\nTL, DR – company takes a year to fulfill order despite promising 4 weeks. Only get order after I contact the chairman\n",

        "text": "Hi guys! I've had Reddit for about a month now and have been stalking the 'Tales' subreddits for a few weeks, and I decided to finally post my own story!\n\nSo, obligatory LTL, FTP, and apology for mobile. Also apologies if I miss or mess up something, as this is my first text post to Reddit.\n\nSo this happened a few weeks ago, I was at an airport hotel for the night to see my twin brother off to Ireland the next morning. So he, myself, and one of my mothers are sitting at the little restaurant they have in the hotel for dinner. There aren't very many people seated and only one waitress. The three of us order our meals, I order the chicken fried steak, Mac and cheese, and steamed broccoli, and our food is brought out to us in less than 20 minutes.\n\nNow, I'm a very picky eater unfortunately. I either like something, or I don't. And I absolutely did not like the steak that I received. It was past well done and was pretty burned, not a single shade of pink was left in the center. Also, it was incredibly salty. Overall the taste made me gag, but since I was in public I soldiered through and swallowed it before going to work on my mac and cheese, which was delicious.\n\nThe restaurant we're in is really small, so our waitress can easily see all of the tables at any given time no matter where she is. She must have seen me give up on my steak because she came over and asked us how the food was. I'm used to servers asking that to just be polite, so I give a polite answer saying that it's good and expect that to be the end of it. It wasn't.\n\nThe waitress takes another look at my steak and says, \"You don't have to lie to me, Miss.\" I'm stunned. I've never had a server that concerned about my experience before. It takes me a second to process it, but once I do I tell her how I truly feel about the steak. She thanks me and disappears into the back.\n\nA few minutes later, I'm finished with my mac and cheese and am spearing my little green trees with my fork when the waitress reappears, this time with the head chef in tow. Now I'm really surprised, and at a complete loss as to how I'm going to handle the situation. I'm terrible at talking to strangers.\n\nSo the chef approaches our table and begins to apologize profusely for the steak and how they hadn't had to prepare that dish in quite some time. Me and my socially awkward self are stumbling over my words trying to say at least a half coherent sentence to the chef, until finally my mom spoke up on my behalf. She explains how I have a low salt tolerance and that I really did like the sides. The chef offered to remake the steak, which I declined. He then offered to bring out more sides, which was also declined, since I really shouldn't have been eating either of them due to my diet (which I totally cheated on that night whoops). The chef shakes my hand and heads back to the kitchen, and we are once again left to our own devices.\n\nSo after we're all done eating our meals we order dessert, and I get a scoop of vanilla gelato. It was brought out to us in record time and, let me tell you, it was the most delicious gelato I've ever had.\n\nThe waitress proceeds to pull one more surprise out of her hat before we leave and says that my dessert was docked from the check to make up for the bad steak. That was huge, since the gelato easily cost around $6 and they didn't have many people there to begin with. Everything that she did to salvage my originally poor impression of the restaurant was was such an amazing gesture, and one that I have never experienced before. We left a huge tip that more than made up for the gelato (which, forgot to mention, she said she paid for out of her own pocket) and her outstanding service.\n\nTL;DR: Waitress does everything she can to give me the best customer service I have ever received.\n\nEdit: Hey guys! I did not expect this post to blow up overnight the way it did, especially since this is my first story! Thank you all so much!\n\nA lot of you guys are saying that they should've comped the steak. And I definitely would've asked for the steak to be removed from the bill if they hadn't gone above and beyond to salvage my experience. Usually when I or one of my family members have had something comped, our server would just comply without a word, or give the usual polite droning. Maybe we'd even get some coupons. But never once have I experienced what I did tonight. I believe they really did care about us and our service.\n\nOf course, should they have offered to comp my meal in the first place? Probably. Would I have rejected the offer? Yes.",

        "text": "So this happened about a year ago. My boyfriend and I were traveling to NYC from LA for the holiday season and as far as LAX being the closest airport to us, we always plan accordingly when traveling, such as going through the security line with our ID's ready, laptops out of the bag, slip on shoes and so forth. \n\nOur flight was scheduled to leave around 8 AM from LA, so we got to the airport around 5 AM. Apparently being this early, only one line is open for security since most TSA agents shifts start at 6 AM (this is what the TSA agent told us that morning). So far there are only about 10 people in line, but it is not moving which was a little shitty but we did not complain and patiently stood there until our turn. \n\nAfter standing in line for only about 15 minutes, this middle age lady starts to loudly push through the line of 15 people by now exclaiming how she is late for her flight and demanding to cut to the front. Since it was 5 am and a short line, no one really cared and let her through to the front. I was a little peeved since the line was already short but it didn't matter since we were pretty early for our flight. After about 40 min we finally got past security with literally only 15 people in line since there were barely any TSA agents.  \n\nI didn't think anything of it until we boarded our flight and lo and behold the pushy lady was sitting comfortably in FIRST class on our same exact flight. My only revenge was giving her a dirty look while passing her seat. Like wtf lady? I always give people the better judgement but this time I wish I hadn't.",

        "text": "So, i'm currently on an ICO roadshow - which involves traveling to multiple cities and speaking at crypto currency conferences and talking to investors.\n\nWe ended up using a travel agent because there are four different teams and they're traveling to different cities on a pretty aggressive schedule. For example I've done 20,000 miles inside of the past three weeks and spoken in Puerto Rico, Seoul and Dubai.\n\nI should mention that I'm also traveling with about 200 pounds of additional luggage in the form of a crypto trading platform and a bunch of accessories as well as back up screens and computers. \n\nThe travel company has been known to screw things up but last week was something else.\n\nWe leave the hotel at about 530 local time to get to the airport and I have one of my coworkers coming along with me to help with the luggage. We get to the airport at about 730 because the traffic in Seoul is crazy. Mind you my flight is at 12:30 but I had a bad feeling given that the travel company screwed up a couple things before.\n\nWe find a cover for Korean air and I start offloading the luggage when their representative tells me that the ticket that I have to go to Dubai was canceled.\n\nSo I end up having to start a Slack conversation with our home office team and try and chase down the travel company to figure out what the hell happened. It appears that this company which was billed as the \"best travel company ever \" managed to book my ticket but then cancel the ticket because they couldn't figure out how to add two additional pieces of luggage in the system. So I'm standing in Korea with a counteragent telling me that I need to cough up $3000 for a one-way ticket which has to be in local currency.\n\nIt takes us 45 minutes to get through to one of the emergency off-hours people for the travel agent who have their contact information buried in such small print that you can barely find it. I finally managed to get the travel rebooked - but that takes about another 40 minutes.\n\nWe then go to check in and they've only booked two pieces of luggage so I end up having to shell out $500 out of pocket to cover the trading system which is in three giant pieces of luggage.\n\nSo about an hour and a half before the flight I finally end up with my ticket and then head off to customs.\n\nThe thing that infuriates me is that aside from screwing up the entire situation - if I hadn't had the foresight to show up a couple hours early not only would I have missed the flight but I would've been stuck at the airport overnight until I got a catch the next flight out.\n\nToday they ended up checking us out of our hotel in Dubai two days ahead of when my next flight is so I ended up spending the entire afternoon trying to get us Rebooked. \n\nTook me a bit to calm down but it just pisses me off that these old-school companies that are supposed to provide service can't even get the most basic things right.\n\n",

        "text": "Okay, so this happened about a year ago. Some time before the situation described I went to this hair stylist who helped me get my poorly bleached hair back into normal. His service isn't cheap, and I liked the result (in hindsight, I would have liked anyone's result as long as there were no splotches of poorly applied bleach in my hair), so I booked an appointment with him for my graduation ceremony in Uni. We agreed that I would come to the salon he worked at by, say, 10 o'clock. The graduation was to begin at 12, so there was more than enough time to curl my hair. However, he turned up 40 minutes late, we barely made it in time, and even though I wanted to ask him to be my wedding stylist, I changed my mind and booked someone else's time. \nThat's not the story however. The story, as I said, happened about a year ago, when I decided it was high time I dyed my hair. He was working in a different salon at that time, so I arranged to come at 11 a.m., expecting us to be done by 3 p.m.. My husband also made an appointment with this stylist, for a haircut, he was to come at about 3 p.m. \nSo, I arrive on time, take a seat on the sofa and wait. And wait. And wait. He shows up an hour late, I'm irritated but decide that it's not critical. I move to the hairdresser seat. He starts to bleach my hair but not before he spent half an hour chatting with his colleague, who, despite chatting, was working on client's hair, whereas my stylist wasn't. I'm a very patient person. He starts bleaching, and I find his application of bleach very weird, as he is applying it only to separate strands of hair, not trying to even out the roots and the ends. Okay, I'm not an expert, he is. He works very slowly, and by the time my husband arrived we were only halfway there. I asked the stylist to give my husband a haircut while I was waiting for him to shower off the bleach from my hair, bur he told me that it wouldn't be long. My husband waits, although he is irritated. The stylist proceeds to rinse the hair, apply the dye and then rinse it all off again after it dries, so it takes about an hour as well. Then came the worst part, as he needed to take a photo for his portfolio, so we spent even more time trying to get the perfect shot, all with me timidly trying to remind him that we are running late and we had other business to do but spend time in the salon, but he kept saying \"Just hang on a sec, it won't be long now\". \nWhen we finally left the salon it was already 6 or 7 p.m., both of us were deeply dissatisfied, and my disappointment became even stronger when a week later most of the dye washed out and revealed poorly bleached strands of hair over dark unattractive roots. Needless to say, I left a poor review for the guy wherever I could and found myself a much better hairstylist who is a punctual and professional person. ",

Me and my buddy came in and see a single worker with three customers in line and she's doing her best to make orders in a timely manner. Normally at this location if they have more than three customers they have a worker come from the  back to help out but not today. \n\nBy the time i get to make my order i asked if she had any help and she informed me she did not. Next worker wasn't scheduled till a hour later. By now there are 4 other individuals behind me excluding my friend. I felt so bad for this girl. She apologized to every customer for their wait and tried to get her job done as fast as she could. \n\nWhen i went to pay i handed her a 10 and let her know that that money was ment for her and her hard work in keeping cool with a long que of customers. Hope her day got better because with how full that store was it was obvious business was steady all day.  Glad to see her put that tip in her pocket right away because she really deserved it.",

Theres a certain pizza place that was in a movie once, about.... getting pizza in 30 minutes or less.   and also robbing  a bank.... etc. Anyway this pizza place has since allowed this singular accomplishment of being used in a movie as an excuse to provide shitty service. \n\nIn the 5 years i have lived in this city, i have ordered from them a few times. Initially, it was fine, usually late and cold upon delivery tho. One day we called to order and they hung up on us. I called from a different phone and when i gave them my address they hung up again. I called again and asked what was going on. Apparently my apartment neighbor, who shared my address (apt 1 vs apt 2) had ordered and not gotten his food for too long before calling and belligerently arguing on the phone. They hung up on him (a trend) and he kept calling (to get his fucking food) and they hung up everytime. He went into the store angry and yelling to get a refund and they did eventually refund, but refused to serve him ever again. \n\nSo when i tried to explain, i am the downstairs neighbor, they told us, they would not deliver and only carryout. Bitch hung up on me again. Fuck that place. Also fuck my stupid neighbor at that time. ",

Around Mile 90, I’m talking on the phone to my mom because I forgot a pair of shoes I need later this week. While she’s looking, she sees I also forgot my purse. I immediately look for an exit so I can turn around as my work ID was in there and I wouldn’t be able to get to my job, let alone do any work without it. At the same time, my parents are getting into their car to try to meet me halfway so I don’t have to make the whole drive back. \n\nI drive back 40 miles and pull off into a fast food parking lot to wait. I was planning on going farther to make it easier for my parents but at that point on the interstate, exits with anything other than sketchy gas stations are few and far between. \n\nAnyway, I sat in my car for about five minutes before I decided to go inside and see if I could pay with my phone for some food while I waited (parents were still about 20 minutes away). I ask the cashier if I can and he says yes, so I order. The total comes to $1.09 but I can’t pay with my phone. Another worker comes up with my food and I ask him to hold on, if I can’t pay with my phone I can’t pay at all as I left my purse at my parent’s house and was just waiting for someone to bring it to me. After a few more tries, I am still unable to pay. The young man who brought the food up, with no hesitation, swiped his card to pay for my food, said “Happy Easter”, smiled, and tried to walk away. \n\nI gave him a huge thank you and said I could pay him back when my purse arrived. He said no need, just please call the number and do the survey, and he told me his name. And then I called the number on the receipt and gave a 5 star review, mentioning him by name. \n\nMy parents showed up about 15 minutes later. I got my purse and was home two hours later than I had planned. My parents decided to eat at that fast food place before returning home.  I’m not sure if the employees were watching out the window, but my mom told me they accidentally made their order twice and gave the additional order to them. ",

It was still pretty early and decided, let’s just go to D-Diner, you know the one, always open and has a great Grand Slam. \nWe quickly shower, get dressed and head out. We get there and they are packed. The hostess meets us and tells us it’ll be a couple of minutes, so we take a seat and wait. LO is being surprisingly patient and all is well.\nWe weren’t told how long the wait was going to be, but we didn’t mind. Maybe five minutes later,  the host, Crystal leads us over to a booth and I ask where the booster seats are. She told me and I grabbed one.\nWe sat down and waited.\nAnd waited.\nThere were two waitresses working the section who ignored us, but we didn’t get annoyed till they sat a party so big, they had to be split across the dining room.\nAnd we still waited. Finally one of the waitresses looked over at us, noted that we still had our menus and no drinks and said someone should be by soon.\nAnother five minutes goes by and the big table has drinks and their orders have been taken.\nAt this point, we’ve been sitting for 15 minutes, in clear view of wait staff and nothing other than that quick, “someone will be with you.”\nIn comes Crystal the hostess. She looks at our menus chilling on the outside of the table and no drinks. She instantly looks pissed and asks if anyone had helped us. We said no.\nShe mutters about how rude her coworkers are, apologizes and pulls out a pad to take our orders. She apologizes again when she’s gotten everything, says it’ll be a couple of minutes.\nWhile we wait, the second waitress also asks if we’ve been taken care of. We said yes.\nNow, it’s getting close to church service time, so the place is clearing out quickly. The two waitresses who have our section are incredibly rude to each other and the buser (we’re just quietly watching this go down) and we notice an older couple who also have not had great service.\nCrystal brings our food. My order is wrong, but it’s an easy fix (I ordered the grand slam, no eggs and pancakes, I got eggs and no pancakes) but I just politely tell her that I ordered this and not that. She apologizes, tells me I’m right and says my pancakes will be right out. My husband and I both say it’s okay.\nEverything else is great. Pancakes come and they’re yummy. The waitresses continue to be rude and we’re glad we didn’t get either of them.\nLO is almost done eating and I bring up that when we pay, I want to make sure Crystal gets the tip. I know some places do it weird and sometimes the hostess doesn’t get money even if they did all of the work. He agrees. \nCrystal drops off our check, apologizes again for how the service was and tells us, “Happy Easter” we tell her she was great and returned the sentiment.\nThe check has her as server. Perfect. We agree to go above 20% because nothing about the rest of our service there was her fault. \nI pay as DH gets LO cleaned up and tell the shift manager that Crystal was fantastic and then we left.\nAll and all, could have gone better, but thank you Crystal for making it the best you could.\n",

Only really hearing one side of the conversation, but basically, the guy on the other end is demanding that they have a BMW M7 available and that they will have it waiting for him. Also nickel-and-diming the worker the whole way through, haggling price asking for upgrades and perks for no better reason than that he was demanding them. Doing it all with a threatening tone and numerous profanities. \n\nWorker finally cuts the conversation short with \n&gt;“Look, sir, if the car is here you can have it but I have other customers waiting!” \nand hangs up abruptly. \n\nWishing to break the tension, my friend steps to the desk and playfully says \n&gt;“What was that? Some people can be assholes!” \nThe worker agrees and they make small talk for a minute to lighten the mood.The worker regains his cool and they proceed with the car rental per usual. \n\nHalfway through the transaction, the worker (W) just stops typing and looks up at my friend (F) with this mischievous smile. \n\n&gt;W: Hey man, can I interest you in an upgrade? We’ve still got a few luxury cars on the lot, and you qualify if you’re interested. \n\n&gt;F: Oh, I can’t. I’m kind of on a budget for this trip. Thanks though. \n\n&gt;W: Oh, it’s not expensive. Actually (looks down and starts furiously typing)… it looks like I just got you a free upgrade.  \n\n&gt;F: Uh…ok thanks. \n\n&gt;W: Alight, so we have upgraded you from a compact to a luxury rental, and it looks like we will be putting you in a BMW M7. \n\n&gt;F: ...(confused)\n\n&gt;W: There’s only one M7 left on the lot, and I’m giving it to you. So now when the asshole on the phone comes to get it, I get to see the look on his face when I tell him it just got rented.\n\nSo my friend got to cruise around the city all weekend in a borderline supercar for $24/day, all because the worker at a car rental desk wanted to spite some entitled jerk. Beautiful.\n",

        "text": "This is a super nice story!\n\nThis happened about six weeks ago and it's winter and brutally cold, so I do a stupid thing.  I put my car key (not the fob though) on a detachable keychain so I can start my car without leaving my house keys outside.  This, of course, falls off after a week and when I feel it go, I'm standing on a sewer grate and yep, it's gone. I'm supposed to be a dinner in forty minutes and it's a twenty minute drive.\n\nI had a spare in my office, but it's beat to hell from having to be pried out of the steering column when it got stuck, so I go to a hardware store before dinner because I know it'll be drawn out and they'll be closed by the time I'm done.  \n\nI run to the back where the keys get made and the guy behind the counter comes over, explains that, yes, my key has a chip in it and those cost extra.  I ask about price and time, he tells me it's gonna be about $80 and take fifteen minutes.  I knew going in that it would be expensive if there was a chip, so I nod and he gives me the plastic to go up to the front of the store to pay and I realize he's been visibly tense that I'm gonna get upset about something because I've probably got the \"the word is making my life harder\" face on because I have literally just lost my key.  But I thank him, and run up to front, pay for the key and head back with the receipt in hand so he can get started now that I've paid.\n\nI go to hand it to him and he takes it and the plastic, stick the key inside right then, hands my back the old key, and says, \"You're good to go.  Make sure to test it before you leave.\"  I don't think I've gone from frustrated to cheerful that quickly in my life.\n\nTurned in the ignition like a charm and I was still on time for my dinner. Plus, it was a good reminder to be nice to the people who can very easily hold your car hostage.",

        "text": "I was in a car accident last month and got real good and messed up. The air bags broke my ribs when they deployed and my foot slid under the pedal somehow and broke the heel and the ankle. \n\nSo I’m taken to the hospital in an ambulance which was unpleasant itself. They tried to get me to walk on my foot that felt like it was dangling off my leg to the stretcher while I cried out in pain. Then hit every bump in the road on the way. Can’t help that but it started me off rocky. I finally get to the hospital and I’m so happy for them to look at me bc it was the worst pain I had ever been in in my 26 years. \n\nThe first nurse was nice enough. He helped me undress so I don’t know if my titties helped his attitude bc the rest of the stay only went downhill. They sent me to the x rays and this woman did not give two shits about the pain I was in. She made me sit up and move around while tears streamed down my face but I figured even though she’s being a bitch she has to get me in the right position somehow. She continues to valiantly ignore me and roll her eyes. Then she had me move my foot up down and all around for these X-rays. It was worse than the initial break bc at least then I had adrenaline flowing. I’m crying heavily now and telling her how bad the pain was and she continued to not help me position myself nor respond to anything I said. \n\nAfter I physically wasn’t capable of the positions she wanted she grabbed my foot like she was grabbing a dick for the first time since Vietnam and forcefully moved it all around while the pieces of my bones had a free for all in my foot. I screamed out and she was completely unphased. Like even if there’s no other way to get these X-rays done than putting me in excruciating pain that’s fine but you don’t have to be the worlds biggest cunt. I’m finally done and she silently takes me back to my room. \n\nThe doctor comes in for all but 5 seconds and tells me it’s just an ankle break and puts on a big splint going right upside my very broken heel giving me searing pain. Idk enough about X-rays to know if queen bitch tits screwed them up or he did but they completely missed the many pieces of my broken heel. I asked for something for the pain and I think they thought I was drug seeking bc I am 19 months clean and had previously written no narcotics on my hospital records. I didn’t give a shit if it was ibuprofen or some shaman singing me a pain relief song I just wanted something but they seemed to dismiss my injuries and I thought that may have played a part. Who knows. \n\nThankfully a few days later I got to an orthopedic surgeon who gave me the right diagnosis and was pissed that they put that stupid splint on my heel. He took great care of me and I am now two weeks away from walking! \n\nEdit: orthopedic surgeon not optometrist, either way he could SEE that my shit was fucked up! ",

No big deal, right? I was told it would be about an hour to cook the pizza and deliver it (Im patient, so I have no issues with this)\n\n*The time: 11PM\n\n*I give a quick call just to see how things are, seeing its now been an hour and 30 minutes. I was told by the person on the phone that nobody ever made my order, that it was being put in now. Okay, fine with me, mistakes happen!\n\n*Time: 1AM\n\n*Okay, now I call and ask what is going on, and the person on the phone sounds higher than a kite and they tell me \"Wha..? You never got your food? Thats crazy!\" And start giggling. So I ask to speak to someone else and they get on the phone and I ask where the pizza is. Cue the manager getting on the phone and, telling me, with quite an attitude \"Look, youll get your food when we get around to it! Now wait your turn, for fucks sake!\"\n\n*And this is where I lose my patience. I tell him he can cancel the order, and he says \"No, you are getting it, and you are going to PAY for it, whether you want it or not!\"\n\n*Well, at this time I just get my girlfriend in the car and we go grab some McDonalds, and my phone is blowing up with calls from someone with a Texas area code. I call it back and was met with \"Dont you EVER call and order food from us again, you asshole!\"\n\n*Joke's on them! I moved two days later. They can keep their pizza, and do some unscrupulous things with it while they're at it.\n\n*(God I wish I could say where this was lol)",

        "text": "Ok, I'm going to try to keep this as concise as possible, because I could easily make this the longest post ever, but I know you all don't need every last detail. Still, this is going to be enormous.  But I just have to get this out, and hopefully you guys will appreciate how absurd it all is and how frustrated we are.\n\nMom has a new stove from... let's say, the military company.  It's actually like 3 years old, but she purchased an extended guaranty. On March 1st, she's cooking a family dinner, when the stove just shuts off. We schedule a service call for March 8th, the first available date.\n\n3/8:  Guy shows up, spends 3 minutes, tells us it's the motherboard, he has to order the part, it can take 2 weeks.  So we re-schedule for March 22.\n\nThe part comes around 3/15.  Boxes look fine, undamaged, which is important later.  I try to call to get the guy to come earlier, but the phone system is such a hassle, we say screw it, we'll wait a week.  It's already been 2 weeks without an oven or range, but she's managing.\n\n3/22:  Guy shows up. Opens the box and removes the part, which is absolutely shattered. The glass display screen and the memory chips behind it are confetti.  Which is odd, since the box shows no damage, but it would have had to have a direct hit right in the middle to do that.  Guy says he has to re-order. Mom freaks out, Passover is 3/30, she has to clean the whole kitchen and cook a huge meal for the family. The guy tells me if we call it in, we might get them to go faster.\n\nI call and am told that the repair guy should have called it in, but instead he \"closed\" the call, so we had to start all over.  The stove company says they can't expedite, I have to call the guaranty company, they place the order and can expedite.  The guaranty company said the stove company ships out the part, so only they can expedite.  At one point Mom yells at someone named after happiness in the Philippines and makes her the opposite of happy.\n\nI finally get someone who is sympathetic, she's named after a gem and she is one, who agrees 3 weeks is too long to be without a cooking appliance, especially with the big holiday coming up.  She puts us in for a service call on 3/27 and says she will get the part shipped out overnight, it may not leave the warehouse until Friday, so we'll get it Monday 3/26, and the guy will fix it Tuesday.  Cutting it kind of close, but it took me 2 hours on the phone to get this much accomplished.\n\nMeanwhile, Mom is calling the appliance store where she bought it, crying about how she can't make Passover for her family, what will she do?  The appliance guy calls his sales rep from the military company.  He says he'll overnight us a part, free. It's normally $300. This is great, now we'll have 2 parts, just in case!\n\n3/26: *One* of the parts has come. It's the free extra one from the military sales rep. I shake it, no glass sounds. I open it, looks ok, what do I know? Fingers crossed.\n\n3/27: Service guy comes and shows us the part.  It's clearly old, the white panel has brown discoloration that comes from age and cooking grease.  He tells me he's not allowed to install anything other than military company new parts.  Plus, the transformer cube has broken off. Even if he wanted to install it, he can't.  He calls the military company to ask about the part they were sending.  They have no record of that order. He puts in another order for the part, tells me it's a 10 day turnaround.  I tell him my mother is 72 and this may give her a heart attack, and to his credit he seems genuinely concerned.  He gives me his manager's phone number.  Mom calls the appliance guy again, tells him his rep shipped us garbage, and get him to send us a real part this time, overnight. Passover is 3 days away, and normally Mom would have had her meatballs already done, as well as the gefilte fish.  She says she can live without the stove, but without the range, she can't make those, or her famous chicken soup. (Pro-tip: use carrot tops and parsley root, whole onions and kohlrabi.)\n\n3/28:  The part arrives FedEx, sent out 3/27 -- is that the one that was supposed to have been shipped from the military company for delivery by 3/26, that as of 3/27, they had no record of? Or is that the new one that he requested on 3/27, that was supposed to take 10 days to get here? No discoloration, no loose pieces, but again, what do I know?  I call the service manager, ask him if there's any way he can get us a tech out here today or tomorrow?  He says he'll find out.\n\nThen the mailman comes with *another* package -- this time, a part shipped right from the military company on 3/26.  So *this* must be the part they were supposed to send last week, which took them 5 days to ship out, and the one that got here earlier today is the one requested yesterday. Whatever. Two parts, no tech.\n\nSo that's where we are now.  Not sure yet if anyone is coming to install it. And no chicken soup for the Passover Seder because Mom said she's too stressed out and she's not buying all those vegetables if she can't cook them, and last night was her 4th and last trip to the grocery store. (Although my husband suggested we try lighting the stove top with a match; after all, the gas service isn't controlled electronically, just the igniter.)\n\nI suppose the moral of the story is... frankly, I don't know. Always buy local, I guess? Because if she had initially bought from a big store, there's no way they would have gotten a sales rep to send a free extra part twice, and they certainly wouldn't have even offered to look and see if they had a floor model that they could lend us.  (They don't have one, but they offered to look, so that's something.)\n\nUpdate:  It's 3/28. The tech showed up. Spent 2 hours + installing the new motherboard.  Then he tells us it's still not working.  Turns out it needs a touchpad too, they must've both been fried.  He says they always go together, usually both are installed at once.  I ask, \"But... didn't YOU order the parts originally? Why did they only send the motherboard? Why have we gotten FOUR motherboards now, but no touchpads?\" He stammers, and answers the question he must have wished I asked, instead of the one I did ask.  \"I already put you down for another service call, this ain't right, being without an oven this long.\" We go in circles for a while, because there's no getting around the fact that HE is the reason we don't have an oven, but of course he's not going to admit it. I offer to rent him the spare room here since he's here so often, and a look of genuine panic crosses his face.  Finally we give up and wish him a good night. https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/f322a332-b3b1-418d-a952-d3581b215121\n\n",

        "text": "So I just bought my first car by myself. I have had the same old 1997 Honda Civic for the last 11 years, and my dad purchased it initially, so this was a big thing for me to be buying a) my first car that I really own myself (I technically have owned the other one for several years, but still) and b) the first car that I have picked out and financed myself. I had decided exactly which car that I wanted and which colors would be acceptable, and I had done a ton of online research. I needed to get a newer car FAST, because my poor little 97 Civic was dying quickly and I didn't want to be on the side of the road in a sketchy neighborhood because of that. \n\nThe first car dealership that I went to was on a whim. My best friend was originally going to be unable to come car shopping with me, but she suddenly had an evening free (and found out that she would be free a few hours prior to that evening), so we went randomly! I had thought that we would go to Dealership A, but it turned out to be slightly farther away than I expected and it was rush hour and my car wasn't doing well during traffic at that point (overheating when sitting still for any amount of time), so we decided to go to Dealership B because it was slightly closer and the opposite direction of the traffic. Dealership B only had two cars that were the right model and color for me. I went into the dealership knowing what I wanted, but I kind of pretended that I wasn't sure, since I'd never been car shopping before and I wanted them to show me everything possible about the cars. I was hopeful about purchasing a car that night, but I wasn't sure that my dad would let me purchase the first car that I was looking at. \n\nNow, I know, I am a grown woman, I shouldn't be relying on my parents for things. However, my parents had offered to pay off a loan of mine, so that I could afford a better car (with a higher monthly payment). That was really, really generous of them and I wasn't going to turn down free money, although it did make me feel like I was having to follow my dad's instructions somewhat because I didn't want him to change his mind about paying off the loan. This is important, I promise. \n\nI looked at both cars and decided that I liked one slightly better than the other, and I test drove it. The car salesman had been very helpful and nice up until this point, offering helpful suggestions and tips about car buying, and telling me that it probably wasn't worth it to trade in my old car because I would get more by selling it or donating it (which is true). After the test drive, the salesman told me that they could run my credit and see how it was, and then I could decide what I wanted to do based on that. I agreed, because I wasn't making any official commitment to the car yet, in my mind. However, I guess the salesman thought that I was committed and was going to buy it. \n\nI called my dad while they were running the numbers, and told him that I really liked the car and wanted to buy it. He told me that although it sounded like a nice car, I shouldn't buy the first car that I look at and I needed to go to at least one other dealership prior to deciding on a car. I was sad, but I understood his point of view. I had wanted to check out the cars at Dealership A, too. But when I told the salesman about my dad's decision, he turned all passive aggressive about it! He said \"Oh, I guess I'll have to tell my manager that the car isn't sold after all.\" Okay, what? I never said that I was actually going to buy the car, you just assumed that! But in the moment, I just felt guilty about leading him on (even though I hadn't) and apologized a lot and explained about my dad. \n\nThese jerks kept my friend and I there for another hour, guilt tripping us and manipulating us, trying to get me to agree to buy the car that night. First they said that they couldn't show me the interest rates that I was potentially getting unless I was going to buy the car, and then they ended up showing me the rates anyway. They tried to tell me that they couldn't tell me my credit score, which might be true, but then told me that even my own bank couldn't tell me my credit score! I literally pulled up my credit score on my phone on my bank's website to prove this idiot wrong about that one. Finally, my friend and I were annoyed and hungry enough (since we had been there for three hours at that point) that we decided to leave. \n\nThat car ended up selling the next day, and I ended up going to Dealership A over the following weekend and getting a better deal on a better car from them. With no guilt tripping or passive aggressive nonsense. Ugg.",

I realize it is the worker who was standing on the right side of the door I just came through. She drags me back to the door and proceeds to speak to me like a child for the whole conversation.\n(CE-condescending employee, me-myself) \n\nCE: You need to have a membership card to shop here. \n\nMe: I’m aware, I showed mine to the other employee walking in. \n\nCE: *Ignores my statement and rants about all the awful things that can happen if people shop without a card and how those without memberships just come to steal* \n\nDuring all this, multiple people just walked by us not showing a card because traffic flow was too heavy for the other lone employee. \n\nMe: Look, Im not here to steal. I’m here to shop. I understand you’re just doing your job, but I already showed my card to her and put it away. Go check with her if you don’t believe me. \n\nShe then stands in front of my cart. \n\nCE: Nobody else has a problem showing me their card. I need to check your card so I know if you’re a member or not. \n\nAt this point I’m upset and flustered, I start digging through my wallet/purse trying to find the card so I can just shop. I forgot it was in my pocket. \nAfter a few seconds of watching me dig, she makes a comment along the lines of “you kids think you can just do whatever you want” under her breath. Didn’t catch it exactly since I was busy digging around thinking I’d lost the card but it was infuriating enough. \nShe then begins pulling my cart toward the service desk. I finally remembered where I’d put the card. I pull my cart back and hand her the card. \n\nMe: Can I go shop now?\n\nCE: *hands card back and walks away without a word* \n\nI called the store later and made a complaint with the manager who just flatly apologized and didn’t seem to care at all. I canceled my membership that same day and go to the other bulk store (SO MUCH BETTER BTW!). \n\nIt wasn’t the fact she had stopped me, but her attitude, speaking to me like a child. On top of indirectly accusing me of coming there to steal and grabbing me. I’ve worked retail. I know its hell on earth, but treat your customers with some level of respect and I’ll return it. ",

Now for background I am almost 30 but don’t look my age.\n\nI went over to a sample station and guess I grabbed the wrong one because the guy running it gave me a hard time.\n\nIt wasn’t what he said but *how*. He treated me like a little kid and even used a belittling finger gesture that people use with young children.  The issue here is being treated like a kid when actually am almost 30. Guy had a really cranky attitude. I can spot him a mile away - he was a short older man with a beard. \n\nIf I get that treatment again from him I will make an anonymous complaint to the management. You don’t treat customers like that. I get why he made his comment but the delivery was disrespectful. ",

We had made a 3:30 reservation. This restaurant has a private room in the back that we like to reserve and the restaurant said okay, but you need to be out by 5:00 for another party. So we were like okay that sounds reasonable we shouldn’t take too long in there.\n\nSo we get there and the hostess tells us that we need to get out by 5:00. We’re like okay, we sit down order, eat our food and everything is good. After we finish eating were waiting for the check so we can go.(it’s about 4:50-4:55) and the hostess comes in.\n\nHostess: “Why are you guys still here? You are supposed to be gone.”\n\nMy Mother: “We know, we’re waiting for the check.”\n\nHostess: “You should be out of here! We have people waiting to use this room!”\n\nMy Mother: “The waiter hasn’t given us the check, once she gives us the check, we will leave.”\n\nHostess: “If you guys don’t leave then i will call the police and have them escort you out.”\n\nOkay so my mom starts crying because she feels like she has embarrassed my brothers and I. My grandmother is partially deaf so she didn’t hear any of this. My grandfather is pissed at the hostess. After another back and forth between the hostess the server comes in.\n\nAfter giving us the check and as we were walking out pissed the manager comes out and says sorry, she is the owners daughter(hmm) and gives us a gift card for the place. \n\nThe next day my mom gets a call from the hostess \n\nHostess: “I am very sorry I was new to the job and I handled that badly and I have mailed you a gift certificate and I hope you come back”\n\nGood on her for saying sorry but that gift certificate is still pinned to a wall as we have not gone back to that restaurant.\n\nEDIT: Some if you are confused who the owners daughter is. The hostess is the owners daughter. As for the manager I don’t think he was related to the owner. I think he was just an outside hire.",

        "text": "Tonight I was driving to pick my wife up from work and I was going to be pretty early, so I stopped on the way there to pick up a sandwich for dinner from a well-known chain of sandwich stores.  I was stopping in pretty late but I knew this location was open 24 hours because I'd been there a few times before.  \n\nThe first thing I noticed on my way in was that the floor was super sticky.  Not just in front of the drink fountain where you'd expect it, but in so many locations that it either had to be multiple spills, all uncleaned, or one big spill that had just been tracked around by a bunch of people stepping in it.  \n\nNext, I start looking for the employee.  I see two people behind the counter; one of them resembled Shaggy (from Scooby-doo) but with massive (1+inch diameter) plugs in his ears and about 4 other assorted piercings, and the other one was a guy who probably weighed at least 300 lbs (and was like 5'8\", so pretty round) and was wearing a Batman T-shirt.  Neither one had anything vaguely employee-ish on them (no badge, apron, or hat).\n\nIt may be unrelated, but this particular retail location is 2 doors down from a recreational marijuana store (it's legal in my state) and while I didn't smell anything, both of these guys had the type of grins on their faces that I have only seen before on guys who were high on something.  \n\nAnyway, after a short period of awkward waiting to be noticed, FatBatman finally spots me and ambles over while PiercedShaggy comes out from behind the counter and takes a seat, playing on his phone.  From this I conclude that PiercedShaggy either doesn't work there or is on break, and I direct my attention towards FatBatman as he asks for my order.\n\nAs he slices the bread and puts the meat and cheese on my sub, I notice 3 things.  First, he's scraping the entire remains of the meat container onto my sandwich, and this has the effect of both giving me probably about 150% of the amount of meat I should have gotten but also soaking my bread with all of the \"meat juice\" in the bottom of the bin.  Second, he gives me double cheese without me asking.  And finally, while all of this is going on I realize that PiercedShaggy has put on a YouTube video on his phone; but it's not just any Youtube video, I recognize it as a Jim Gaffigan video where he specifically makes fun of this particular sandwich chain.  \n\nFor the remainder of the time it takes the sandwich to cook plus adding the veggies, both PiercedShaggy and FatBatman are giggling along with the track but they have clearly heard it multiple times before as I see them mouthing along with a few of the bits in the video.  \n\nThe veggies and packing get done relatively normally and then it comes time to pay.  The sandwich I ordered should have been about 9 dollars (not even including the extra meat and cheese that he added just because) but it rings up for 5 bucks.  I ask him if I'm sure he got it right, and FatBatman waves me off, saying something like \"whatever, I just have to charge you for something\".  So I hand him the five-dollar bill out of the 1 five and 4 ones I had waiting for him, and while he's putting it in the register I'm looking all around and I don't see a tip jar or anything, as I was thinking I ought to put at least a dollar or two in there since I just saved $4, but there's none to be found.  Either someone took off with it earlier or they don't use it there any more... I have no idea which.  So I just kept my dollar bills and went out the door the long way around to try and avoid the stickiest part of the floor.\n\nSo, in the end I went away with a half-price sandwich that was somewhat soggy in places and I got a free show with my dinner too.  I can't decide if I should use the survey I got on the receipt to rat on these guys or say nothing because they saved me 4 bucks and the sogginess of the sandwich wasn't all that bad, really.",

Adding insult to injury, people who had arrived an hour after them had already received their food.\n\nOf course, as a few orders finally came, they were horrendously wrong. Her religiously vegetarian friend had received a chicken enchilada and ended up regurgitating it on the table.\n\nThe waitress was extremely helpful. She tried to talk to her manager and even offered to pay for our meal. It took her many tries to convince the lazy manager to even speak with us. The manager wasn’t fluent in English so their arguing was pretty much fruitless. The *not-so-gracious* manager refused to give us any discount until the 7 of them had made a scene. After the whole ordeal the manager had gave a mind-boggling **10%**.\n\nAt that point they were running late to closing ceremonies and had no intention of staying any longer to wait for the rest of the food and wanted to pay. But things only became worse. One of her friends who **didn't even receive her meal** still had to pay for it.\n\nOf course, the stupid manager didn't give proper change. He **rounded down** the change by several dollars resulting in everyone paying more than they would have without the measly discount.\n\nEven when we tipped the wonderful waitress, the selfish manager motioned *give me* and stole her tip.\n\nThe whole ordeal was so **excruciating** that my friend barely got any sleep over it. Hopefully the restaurant will change before next year's event. Even then, no one will be setting foot near that place again.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add that they were in a rush.\n\nEdit 2: Forgot to add that the manager wasn’t fluent in English which made arguing pointless.",

Okay. Y'all, I'm an old cynical lady with a sharp tongue, but this was a total judo move.

        "text": "So on feb. 12 to get a full synthetic oil change for my (annoying) car. I think I paid like 70 for it, which was the best I could find. I chose that one because it came with some rebate if I mailed it in whatever whatever. I’ve been to this shop before. It was fine. The only thing I didn’t like was the dude who greeted me and took care of my transaction seemed pretty flippant to me and talked about my car to other people like I wasn’t literally 2 feet away from him. It struck me weird because he literally said the smallest amount of words possible to me for the entire time of my being there. Corporate had sent me a survey and all I said was that “the guy at the front acted like I wasn’t in front of him” or something very close to that wording.\n\nSo yesterday my low oil light comes on and I was like you’ve got to be kidding me. I get home and I can’t even get oil to read on the dip stick. Call up the place, they tell me to bring it back. Used another car to go buy a few quarts of oil to be able to drive.\n\nSo I walk in and see the service manager (different than the flippant guy from before. First words out of his mouth were “OH SO I HEAR THAT YOU DONT LIKE OUR SERVICE” and I was pretty dumbfounded, trying to remember if what I said was even all that bad/dramatic (I don’t think it was). I was like “oh.......yea? I wasn’t talking about you, it was more of the transaction with the other guy.” “WELL WE’RE A TEAM HERE” and I’m think dearrrrrrr christ get me out of here.\n\nProps to the service manager tho, he gave me a cash refund for the oil I had to put in the car to drive it there. He told me “we had a hard time putting your oil filter in last time, don’t you remember us telling you we had a hard time resetting your oil light?” And I said  “No? No one told me that at all” (the only thing heard spoken about my car was the flippant guy talking to someone else, not anything about my oil filter/light either) and he said “yea after the survey I tried to reach out to you because we ordered a new oil filter” (I’m wondering why I even had to leave for him to tell me, but I don’t work on cars so whatever) I told him “oh, I don’t remember getting any sort of ca—“”Oh I left a message” (I knew good and damn well he never left me a message but I didn’t press it).\n\nLong story short, sat in the waiting room in agony. APPARENTLY my car is burning up synthetic oil and now I need to use high mileage even though my car literally says under the hood synthetic (again, don’t work on cars so maybe he’s right”\n\nI guess they were trying to kiss my butt, the service manager gave me whatever off on my next high mileage oil change (which is so much cheaper anyway). I don’t really think I even care about the discount. They made direct comments to call me out on some BS survey I was literally regaling my visit in. Awkward as shit.\n\nNot ever going back somewhere that I do a survey for that isn’t like 5/5 star service.",

        "text": "This was about 6 years ago, when I was looking for a dress for my brothers wedding. I was carrying a few extra pounds but not massively so, a UK size 16 (14 is the UK national average). I went to a local city that I knew had lots of dress shops and I'd been looking all day but not found anything suitable. Then, in a little boutique, suddenly saw THE dress and wanted to try it on to check it fitted right. The assistant was nice as pie to start with and chatted to me while I was having a walk about in it. I told her it was for my brothers wedding and she immediately said \"Oh, maybe you could find a boyfriend there\" I replied that actually I have a boyfriend of 15 years and am very happy but she continued (in a really sneery voice) \"If you didn't you could look for someone at the wedding\" and the look on her face said that she just didn't believe that I had a boyfriend and that she was feeling sorry for me. I still bought it cos it was a lovely dress but I've always remembered that assistant and how she tried to be so condescending. Wish now I'd gone back in with him the next week and given him a great big kiss in front of her sneering face! ",

I’ve had coolers before but never mixes and this was my first time going in any bar. \n\nThe waitress comes, gets my ID, then asks what I wasn’t to drink. I ask her for a drink menu and she said they don’t have any, so I ask her what kind of fruity drinks they may have. \nShe gives me a look as if I’m stupid and said “Really? Are you SURE you’re 18? Let’s see your ID again.”\nSo I hand it to her and she squints at it, and said “Okay, but seriously you should know what kind of drinks there are at the bar. I’ll be back in 10 so you can figure out what you want.” So she gave me back my ID and left. \nNeedless to say I left very angrily. \n\nEDIT: Well now thanks to these comments I can happily go to bars and know what kinds of fruity drinks to order! Thanks everyone. And yes, I am from Canada. ",

        "text": "Hello, FTP, LTL here. Also on mobile, so apologies for any formatting issues.\n\nNow, the grocery store that I live near has wine tastings every so often, and not being very versed in wine culture, I love to sample new flavors. Now, I’m 26, but I look like I’m 16-18. This is important. Anyways.\n\nThe woman hadn’t set up yet, so I hung around the next few aisles waiting for her to set up (having worked samples myself, I know how annoying it is to be asked for food before you’ve set up). She sets up, and I pull up my cart.\n\nShe asks for my ID, which is all fine and good. I have a baby face, it happens. I make a small joke about the fact that I look like a teenager, and this is where it starts to go sour. She nods at me and says, “Yeah, you do” as she squints suspiciously at my license (my horizontal adult license, mind you). Seeming satisfied, she hands it back. She then looks down at the wine, back at me, and says, “This one doesn’t have a lot left, so I’ll do this one first.” (Okaaay) She goes on to say, “I haven’t tried this either” and then pours herself a sip and downs it. I’m like, okay, a little weird, but I’m still game. Then she proceeds to tell me in a disinterested tone of voice about the wine, which is literally just, “This is red wine, it’s more fruity.” I’m beginning to get annoyed at this point, realizing that she doesn’t see me as a customer but just as someone who wants to drink. Then comes the last straw. An older woman comes by with her cart and the sampler stops MID-SPEECH and turns to her and asks her if she wants a sample.\n\nNow, I’m a very nice person. I believe in the benefit of the doubt. But as she proceeds to flat-out IGNORE me and engage in conversation with the other woman, I decide to turn to her and say loudly, in the most saccharine voice, “I hope you have a day as wonderful as you are.”\n\nI realize I could have stuck up for myself more, but years of retail made me not give in to my rage. I eventually left and when I got home I called the store’s manager. Now, I know that the samples company would be different from the grocery store, but I told them to pass the incident along to her boss. The manager agreed that she was incredibly rude, and I don’t know what happened to her (probably nothing), but I felt a little bit better. The kicker is, I was ready to buy some wine (and had in the past from samplings)! Moral of the story, don’t judge a book by its cover.\n\nTl;dr: A grocery store wine sampler woman discriminated against me because I look like a teenager, even though I’m 26, and I didn’t quite get justice but I did at least call the manager",

        "text": "I had posted this in /talesfromretail but got directed here.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t know why I just remembered this, but this is a story from my last visit to hairdresser. I don’t work there, just a paying customer.\n\nSo, one of my favourite parts of getting my hair done is the massage when they shampoo me. I get my hair done probably every two months but I LOVE the massage, my stylist is the best at it! Love just laying there and relaxing, my stylist knows I do not talk while she’s doing it. I zone out. This is my pamper time, and we chat up a storm for the rest of my appointment, and she gets most of my JNMIL stories before reddit does. This is our thing ha ha.\n\nSo anyway, my last visit and I’m settling in at the sink waiting for the magic to happen. I knew then from the moment I sat down, there would be no zen time that day. Next to me is a lady who’s had some mad hair done, and she starts screeching at her daughter, who could not have been more than 4. To set the scene, she was having a colour washed out, so had to have been there I reckon at least 40 minutes already, minimum. This is important, because it explains why 4 yr old who has been entertaining herself in a salon, is starting to get very restless, and trying to amuse herself in any way she can. \n\nSo, her daughter, little girl (LG) comes over to the sinks and is playing something on mums phone, full volume up. Mum starts shouting at her to “turn that bloody thing off”. In the next 30 minutes I was at the sink she cane out with the following, at full volume: \n\n• Turn off that bloody noise\n• Give me the bloody phone\n• you’re such a horrible naughty girl\n• I’m so glad I’m going away tonight and leaving you with daddy\n• get off the floor\n\nAt this stage, LG blows a raspberry at her Mum\n\n• that’s it, you’re not getting any candy, I’m taking all your birthday toys away\n• I wish I went away yesterday\n\nMy stylist took me back to the mirror then to cut and finish, and then this horrid woman ends up next to me. She literally kept going on same thread, and this LG was just bored out of her mind and trying to entertain herself. My stylist and I were epic eye rolling, and stylist says to me “Oh that’s nothing, before you got here, she said to LG ‘shall we kill daddy so we can eat all the candy’ “.\n\nAll my what’s?? This woman has serious issues and I felt so bad for the little girl. Hoping my next appointment won’t coincide with hers, I need my head massage!!!\n\n",

My family all ordered and when the food came my grandfather realized he got a baked potato instead of mashed. The server told him no problem he'd be right back with the mashed potatoes... that's when he leaned over and picked the baked potato up off my grandfathers plate spilling a water in his other hand on my moms shoulder. Fortunately we all laughed it off but I did tell my buddy who was bartending that he might want to inform the guy not to just reach over and pick something up off of a customers plate.",

        "text": "Newish to reddit, so sorry if formatting isn't optimal. Also i'm fairly certain this is the correct subreddit for this, but if there is a better one let me know.\n\nThis happened 3 years ago in my sophomore year of high school. Me and a group of about 30 other students were coming home from a school event. For this specific event it was tradition to stop at the mall closest to us to get food. So we all piled out of the school bus, and met at the food court. After eating our overpriced food we were allowed to walk around the mall for about an hour as long as we went in groups, or as pairs. Me and one of my friends Kyle decided to split from our group to walk around.\n\n\nA little backstory on Kyle. Kyle was a senior in high school at the time, and i really looked up to him. He was basically everything my geeky sophomore self wanted to be. He talked about parties, girls, and alcohol like it was nothing, so naturally i respected him. \n\n\nAnyway as we were walking around Kyle insisted that we go to a very specific store. This store had a lot of edgy merchandise in it such as shirts with dirty language on them, snapbacks, inappropriate trinkets, ect. However if you go to the back of the shop, they have more adult oriented items, such as drinking games, and adult toys.\n\n\nEven though i was extremely uncomfortable, Kyle managed to pester me enough to go to the dimly lit back of the store. We checked out some of the drinking games, and he talked about wanting to try them out. Then we went to what was basically a wall of sex toys. As he talked about potentially buying one for his girlfriend, and as i tried convincing him not to since we were still on a school trip, we were approached by two woman. \n\n\nThese two woman I can only to this day, describe to you in the most stereotypical and generalizing terms, as sex workers. (If this is your line of work, I don't judge just telling the story to the best of my ability) They both had blonde hair, heavy makeup, and revealing clothing. I also distinctively remember one of them having a cropped fur jacket. This was definitely not what the other employees were wearing, and it genuinely looked like they stepped out of a movie. As they approached us we had this exchange, the two woman will be W1 and W2, Kyle is Kyle, and I will be Me.\n\n\nW1: *in a suggestive tone* do you guys need help with anything?\n\n\nKyle: No, i'm just showing my little buddy the ropes here.\n\n\nW2: **even more suggestive** Ohhh, the ropes are over there.\n\n\nKyle: *startled and nervous* O-Ok, I uh think its time for us to go now.\n\n\nThe two woman then started laughing as Kyle literally pushed me out of the store.\n\n*once out of the store*\n\n\nKyle: oh my god, those were prostitutes.\n\n\nMe: *laughing* no way, but they just destroyed you.\n\n\nKyle: No for real, those we're actual prostitutes.\n\n\nAfterwards we met back up with our group and I told them what happened. We all had a good laugh about it, especially over the skilled wordplay woman 2 had.\n\n\n\nJust as a last note prostitution is illegal in the state that I live in, so I couldn't tell you if they were sex workers for sure, but Kyle was very insistent that they were, and too this day he still believes that they were, so I will take his word for it.\n\n",
