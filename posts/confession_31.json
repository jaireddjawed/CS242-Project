I don’t think actual therapist or psychologists just openly diagnose people.\n\nThe argument weirdly became an ego thing just because I told her she wasn’t qualified to do so. She also tried to keep dismissing me based on the mental disorder that she SPECULATED that I had. It was one of the most frustrating arguments I ever had.",

        "text": "I feel like I’m a slave to my most primal instincts. I used to be considered academically gifted in school and got good grades, but I spent most of my college class pacing the halls because I wanted to stretch my legs at the time, ended up taking out a loan to resit the last year and then didn’t submit a single piece of work because I was skipping class to jerk off multiple times per day in the college bathrooms just because I wanted to jerk off then. I literally pretended to go to graduation. I’ve pretended to be looking for a job for a year now, and I’m running outta excuses. I will literally just listen to music and run around my room in circles because I feel restless and I’ve been doing this for months, too scared to tell anyone the truth,  but I feel like it’s been too long now and I can’t keep it up. I don’t know what to do. Even my eating habits are affected and I feel like I’m chubby now. I’ve always struggled with overeating, but not to the extent where it could rival the fact that I literally run around all day. My stomach just feels too fat and it constantly reminds me of how irritated I am with myself and why. I feel like such a primitive-minded idiot for so easily giving into anything resulting in instant gratification even when I know there’s more to life and that it’s no way to live; I wake up with the plan to fix it every single day, but nothing ever changes. I just feel useless now. All I really do is play video games, run the room around listening to music through my headphones, eat stupid amounts of spicy food at 3 am, jerk off, play video games and watch porn. I’m in my 20s, but I feel emotionally immature and incompetent. I never thought my life would ever end up this way, but I am also losing hope that it’ll change anytime soon.",

I always laugh at whatever happening in my life to not feel sad, but it's getting harder I have hidden my feelings for so long I can't even cry in a closed room cause I'm scared, I didn't even say I love you to my mum before coming to UK for studies 6 months back cause I was scared Idk why, i tried but my hands kept shaking, In school, I use to talk to the \"social losers\" for 5 mins every other day cause they felt really good talking to someone who had so many friends. Now I see them with friends and enjoying life in their own way, and I just feel like a loser who has no real skills value or friends, or worth in terms of the modern world. my dad was a bad husband they divorced and my mom has bipolar and depression now from her trauma and refuses out right to get checked, both my brothers do something to help her other than basic helping that I do like they are doing well in studies/life/money wise to help her. I try but other than basic stuff like not triggering her and trying to make her laugh I am genuinely not capable to do it as of now. I have always lived thinking glass half full but I never imagined myself to be a loser, as a child I remember always saying I'm the best etc. I once did share my weakest part to my then GF and later on a call after break up she made fun that in front of people saying I can't even stand up to my dad or I have dad issues, I didn't find it hurtful as it is the truth\\* I'm very logical in that sense\\* lately I have no idea what I want what i really feel or anything like that, I keep suppressing myself and now I'm really unable to stop it of I don't want fake sympathy or its okay to cry BS,TBH I just wanted to write it out if not say it out loud, I'm scared that because of this part of me, I'll never be able to be with someone.\n\nno one will prolly even read this.",
