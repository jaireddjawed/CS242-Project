I read through the comments in the thread, \"What is a show you walked out on?\" Bob Dylan was named more than any other artist.  \n\nSeveral people commented, you never know what you are going to get with Bob Dylan, either the best show ever, or the worst show you ever been to.  \n\nMy question is, when was the last time someone saw him and said, \"that's the best show I have ever seen\"?  I betting it's been decades.  I'd love the hear differently, but I'm afraid his \"best show ever\" years are long behind him.",

There is some relation (eg tempo, some melodic ideas that are used in both) but they are quite different to each other. Is there a way to know whether it counts as a binary piece or a piece in two movements?",

I want my ears to hear different types of music that’s out there so getting some recommendations for albums you guys really like would be awesome! \n\nIt can be ANYTHING, and I mean anything. If there’s a subgenre you recommend, feel free to send those my way. Otherwise, you can recommend the most popular artists to the most niche ones you know. I don’t have a preference for now, so I’m open to anything.\n\nThank you all for your help!",
