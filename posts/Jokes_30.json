        "text": "So, the small zoo is not doing well, so badly, in fact, they may be closing and declaring bankruptcy.  The zoo director has been tearing his hair out trying to find something to attract customers.  Finally, he finds an orangutan for sale from another zoo, who sounds like just the ticket.  Great entertainment, and always willing to show off for people.  But the price is high.\n\nThe director talks the board into the deal, pointing out that going broke is going broke, what's another zero on the bankruptcy?  He promises that he will have one zoo keeper dedicated to taking care of the new animal.\n\nClive the orangutan arrives, and is everything that was promised, and more.  Advertising is hardly needed, word of mouth is bringing people to the zoo in droves.  People pay to see Clive.  They buy Clive posters, mugs, keychains, and little stuffed Clive dolls for their kids.  The zoo is making a profit, and is beginning to dig out of the mountain of debt.\n\nAnd then, disaster.  Clive's personal keeper calls the director early one morning:  \"Clive is out!  He broke through the fence, and I can't find him anywhere!\"\n\nThe director breaks every traffic law in existence getting to the zoo.  They look everywhere, and find Clive across the freeway in a city park, up in a huge tree.  The director and keeper are frantic, trying to get Clive down, but nothing works.  Treats, Clive's favorite toys, even a cute female orangutan, no joy.\n\nA few hours go by, and still nothing is working.  A guy walking his dog in the park watches with some amusement, and suggests to the director, \"Why don't you look in the Yellow Pages?\"  The director tells him to mind his business, and the dog walker shrugs and walks away.\n\nThe director says to the keeper, \"Well, what do we have to lose, maybe that guy knows something.  Go get the Yellow Pages.\"\n\nSo the keeper comes back with the phone book, and what do you know, there's a section for \"Primate Retrieval.\"  Only one listing, \"Joe's Primate Retrieval Services,\" company motto, \"We don't monkey around when you need your primate found!\"  The director and keeper are amazed, but skeptical.  After some discussion, the director decides he has nothing to lose, and calls the number.\n\nJoe answers, the director explains the situation, and asks if there's any hope.  Joe says he's heard about Clive, asks some questions about what they've tried already, quotes a high, up front, non-refundable price that the director pays, and Joe says he will be there as soon as he can.\n\n.....\n\nJoe arrives in a jaunty yellow van, emblazoned with \"Joe's Primate Retrieval Services\" as well as the motto on all sides, and hops out in his bright yellow coveralls to survey the scene.  After a few minutes, Joe tells the frantic director and keeper that they can relax, this should be pretty simple, and he begins to unload his equipment.\n\nHe brings out of the van a baseball bat, a pair of handcuffs, a twelve-gauge shotgun, and a small, well trained dog.\n\nThe director, knowing that his job, as well as the zoo's future is on the line, objects immediately to the shotgun.  \"You can't possibly be thinking of shooting Clive!  Forget it, I knew this was a bad idea!\"\n\nJoe calmly says, \"Hold on, you don't want me to leave now, you already paid, and it's non-refundable.  Let me explain how this will work.  You hold the shotgun, that way, if Clive gets shot, it's your fault.\"\n\n\"So, here's what's going to happen.  Remember, I'm a professional, this is what I do.  The zoo keeper is going to be in charge of the handcuffs.  I'm going to take the baseball bat, climb the tree, and knock Clive out of the tree.  It might bruise him up a bit, but he'll be fine.  As soon as Clive hits the ground, my small, well trained dog will run over and chomp down on Clive's balls.  As soon as that happens, Clive will reach down with both hands to try to protect himself, and the keeper can clap the handcuffs on.  Clive might run around a bit, but he won't be able to climb with the handcuffs, so we can handle that OK.  At that point, it's all over but loading him up and getting him back into his enclosure.\"\n\nAfter a few seconds, the director asks, \"OK, that all seems reasonable, but where does this shotgun fit into the plan?\"\n\nJoe says, \"Well, I wouldn't really worry about it, because the chance we'll need it is tiny.  Remember, I'm a professional, this is what I do.  But, if by any chance Clive should knock *me* out of the tree, shoot the dog.\"",

After a few nights, he notices an average looking guy picking up a different woman every night.    \n\nIt goes like this.  He walks up to her and says something.   She hits him.  He apologizes, and she is embarrassed.  They have drinks, and leave together. \n\nSo he gets up his nerve and sits down with the guy  when he comes in.  Florida Man asks, \"Hey, I see you say something to the women, get hit, then she buys you a drink, and you leave together.  How do you do it?\"\n\nSo he explains. (For this part, make yourself sound like a Canadian doing a bad Australian accent). \" Well, I walk by and say, 'tickle your ass with a feather?'   So she hits me, right?  Then I say, 'whats that for?  I simply said its typically nasty weather?  Then she feels bad, and you see what happens next. \"\n\nSo Florida Man watches while the man does his routine.   Then it is his turn. (Now you need to sound like a Canadian doing a drunk Florida Man accent).   He approaches a woman and says, \"Hey, stick a feather in your ass\".  He gets punched.  Then he says, \"No no.  I said, \"Its frickking  raining out\".",

The Sun greeted him: “Good morning, comrade Xi!” the Sun said, “I hope you slept well.”\n\nXi was extremely pleased with himself that the Sun spoke to HIM.  After his meetings, at noon, Xi went for a walk. The Sun said: “Good day, comrade Xi, I hope your day is going well.” Xi again marveled that the Sun was speaking to him.  \n\nIn the evening, Xi went out on the veranda and faced the setting Sun. Xi was greeted with silence. Xi waited, but the Sun did not speak. \n\nXi spoke: “Good evening, comrade Sun!”\n\nNothing.\n\n“I said, Good evening, comrade Sun!”\n\nThe Sun replied, “Fuck you! I'm in the west now!”",
