For those unaware, Sleeping Giants is an anonymous Twitter account which has been engaged in a campaign to get brands to drop their ads from the altright website Breitbart for the last couple of years.  \n\nhttps://www.adweek.com/agencies/the-daily-caller-names-founder-of-sleeping-giants-which-organized-breitbart-advertiser-boycotts/\n\nThe Sleeping Giants founders names and family members were outed, and following that a series of right-wing trolls have been using Twitter and the comment sections of Breitbart to share their phone numbers / addresses, and harass the founder and their family both online and in real life.\n\nInterestingly, following the expose by the Daily Caller, Sleeping Giants has seen a huge surge in activity and support, and even more brands are leaving Breitbart.  They even got a cover story on the front of the business section this week highlighting their efforts.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/business/media/sleeping-giants-breitbart-twitter.html\n\n_____________\n\nSo my question for you all on Reddit is, when is doxxing acceptable, if ever?  \n\nIs exposing, naming, and shaming racists an acceptable action?  \n\nIs there a difference between doxxing individuals for their actions in public / real life vs. for things they say on the internet on say Twitter or Reddit?",

        "text": "Until a moment ago, I'd thought of new versions of popular websites this way: the website beta-tests a new design, finds out what users like and don't like, how they use it, etc., makes a few tweaks, and then begins the process of gradually nudging ALL users to opt for the new version, making it more difficult to opt for the older version before phasing the older version out entirely. In most cases, the majority of legacy users complain about the new version (which is probably designed, in some way or another, to improve revenue) for a bit before habituating to it. In a few cases, legacy users leave en masse and the website fails (see digg). \n\nBut then I thought: why can't the two versions - old and new - co-exist indefinitely? As long as they are, in some sense, compatible with one another, why can't one group of users (legacy users who've grown to love, or at least tolerate, Reddit's look and feel, which haven't changed much over 10 years) use one version, and another group of users (noobs accustomed to a social-media-feed-like experience) use another? If this is possible, Reddit retains the existing users while adding new users. \n\nLeaving aside larger questions of the effects of 'noobs' on the 'culture' of Reddit, is there any technical or business reason why a company like Reddit would not design for two (or more) versions of their site to co-exist indefinitely? Even if it cost more $ for them to do this, millions more, it might still be worth it if you could retain and gain enough users (who then look at ads, buy gold, etc.). I know that such things wouldn't work the same way for a piece of hardware, like an IPhone, but what about websites? Is this far-fetched? I'm not a designer/programmer, so I'm curious as to what those who are have to say about this theory. ",

        "text": "Edit: I didn't want to have to mention it, but I'm saying this as a female redditor (my username begins with \"miss\" , ffs!) I'm also a feminist and I lean pretty far left. I stand by my statement. Don't try to prove to me that some redditors suck, I'm well aware. And this isn't Change My View. I used to be active in SRS, ok? I'm still subscribed, as well as to a lot of other \"watchdog\"/meta subs. I still think reddit as a whole is a good thing. And if you don't, what do you propose to do about it? And honestly, why do you stick around? Not trying to be mean, I'm just beginning to get curious. I get the self deprecation and contrarianism, I really do. But think about it for a second. Think about other websites and the quality of the conversation.\n\nIt's also kind of odd that people using *this* sub are obviously using the downvote button as a \"disagree\" button. Cause obviously my post adds to the discussion; it couldn't really get more \"navel gazing\" and meta. I know it's in bad taste to complain about downvotes, and I usually don't, but in this case... I had to mention it.\n\n~\n\nThis has just been my experience. I remember when I started using reddit five years ago, much of my motivation was curiosity over how much of a racist, sexist shithole it really is here. Because that's been the picture painted by the media. But while there obviously is/was some disgusting content on here, it really seems like most of us are (relatively) sane. Obviously there are exceptions, and I'll admit that I don't spend time on some of the more popular subs (though I do spend time on many of them). Usually, I feel I can count on the community to police itself. Every now and then, something gross will get upvoted, but it seems like the exception rather than the rule.\n\nI've been thinking about this lately, because I've recently been *trying* to get into Twitter. That's where the good people supposedly are, right? The nice, unproblematic, mainstream folks? Well, no... Not really. I mean, many Twitter users are fine, but there's nothing to do about the ones who aren't. You can block them, but that's just so tacky and passive aggressive, imo. Reddit, on the other hand... It's taken me a while to really be sold on the downvote button. It sucks to be downvoted! But you know what sucks even worse? Having to watch people yell at each other using lame ad hominem arguments. And to have no recourse, besides yelling back at them, pretty much. People there also seem almost as naive as big FB users, falling for obvious ~~pleas for money~~ sob stories.\n\nSo honestly, I can't really get behind this idea that Reddit is a toxic, festering shithole. Certain *subs* are toxic, but guess what, shitty people are almost... *contained* in those subs. I'd rather let them sit there in a tub of they're own filth, tbh, than have them running around unchecked. The theory behind reddit is a good one; usually the good stuff rises to the top, with some exceptions. I don't know that I'd extend this theory too far into other areas, for instance, the \"free market place of ideas\" line can be problematic in certain contexts. But the stakes aren't really that high here, so I really do think it works.",

        "text": "[Observe this account.](https://www.reddit.com/user/alfaguara27)\n\nThere are multiple posts to r/GetMotivated, each marked with a number in brackets at the end, beginning with [(#1)](https://www.reddit.com/user/alfaguara27?sort=new&amp;after=t3_8bmmww&amp;count=250), and then rising up in a sequence denoting the number of overall posts on the account. Therefore, a post title with \"(100)\" at the end would usually signify that it is the 100th overall post on the account. [The number 12 seems to be missing, however.](https://www.reddit.com/user/alfaguara27?sort=new&amp;before=t3_8bmlnb&amp;count=251)\n\nThere do not seem to be any posts to any other subreddit, and additionally there are no comments. However, the account does have 1000 comment karma, meaning it's possible there were in fact some comments, but they have been deleted.\n\nIn total, as of the time of this post, the account has collected around 233,694 post karma.\n\nIn my opinion, there are probably three likely possibilities as to resolve the mystery of this account:\n\n* It is a genuine novelty account.\n\n    This does not seem likely. For one, the subreddit chosen, r/GetMotivated, would seem very out of place for any novelty account operator. Why this particular one? Additionally, there does not seem to be any particular defining feature of the account's posting style in a similar fashion to other novelty accounts, the brackets seem too trivial to count.\n\n* It belongs to an account seller, and all posts are directly made by the seller.\n\n    This also seems to be unlikely. For one, it's unclear why somebody would be willing to purchase the account in this condition. In other words, even casual buyers of Reddit accounts (that is, those who do not necessarily have some ulterior plan and simply wish to, say, promote their product or service) may notice the seemingly almost robotic nature of the account which would probably discourage them from buying it - it would simply be too obvious.\n\n    Basically, if this is truly an account seller, it doesn't seem that the account is exactly the type people would want to buy anyway.\n\n* It is a bot account in a vast account network that is run by an account seller, that is designed to re-post other posts from subreddits.\n\n    Automating posts would be far more efficient than manually posting them, especially on a large, multi-account scale. However, this raises two questions - why did the bot miss the number 12, and why are numbers 1 to 11 preceded by a hash sign but the ones afterward are not, that is, it is not consistent?\n\n    I think this could be an error in the code. It very well could be a human being who just slipped up, but the strange nature of the posts makes me think it's unlikely somebody would want to do all this.\n\n    But even assuming all this, what explains the deleted comments? My opinion is that the account was already previously sold. Either the previous owner (who may or may not be the original owner) deleted all the comments - or the new buyer is the one who deleted them.",

But for me it's because of propaganda.\n\nQuite a few political subs from both extremes use interesting memes and jokes to gain upvotes and a following. The memes themselves can be funny. I remember I used to upvote a lot of the t_d posts as I found them funny and considered the sub just a meme sub. Later I found out it was a political sub and stopped considering the posts funny. Now I consider them political. But I don't downvote them either unless they spam my frontpage.\n\nThe same has happened to me with a socialist joke subreddit. I used to upvote the jokes on the frontpage and smile at them. Then I started going to the comment section and was flabbergasted by how much hate mongering went on there. I did not want to support hate and appeal to violence. Now I sometimes upvote the posts from that sub when they make me smile but as soon as I read the name of the sub itself I downvote them. I know the memes are propaganda and I know what the sub is used for. It has disguised itself as a joke sub but in reality that's just an appeal to reel in followers.\n\nBut now I'm wondering. How do other people feel about downvoting posts just because they are from a sub you know spreads hate and violence in this world? I only do it when I spot such a post on a frontpage but it still makes me think.",

        "text": "The introduction of comments on Reddit in December 2005 was a momentous occasion that changed the website forever. However the traditional story behind the first ever Reddit comment turns out to be wrong and there is still a mystery over what the first comment was and who wrote it. \n\nIn this post we will try to solve that mystery.\n\nOn December 12th 2005, at 10:47:49 UTC, /u/Nutshapio made a post called ['Reddit now supports comments'](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/17913/reddit_now_supports_comments/).\n\nRoughly two hours later, at 12:46:44 UTC, /u/charlieb made the first comment on that post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/17913/reddit_now_supports_comments/c51/\n\n&gt; There's nothing like simplicity and not following the crowd. I for one welcome our new comment spam overlords. Oh and by the way; 1) Come up with a great simple idea 2) Wait for a degree of popularity and media attention 3) Add unnecessary features 4) Profit. Is this what you want?\n\nThis comment became semi-famous on Reddit as the first ever Reddit comment. It was a humorous factoid that the first  comment was complaining about Reddit going downhill. The comment was the subject of a [bestof post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1ca8yt/the_first_ever_reddit_comment_complained_about/), a [TIL post](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/hdnhl/til_that_the_first_comment_on_reddit_was_a/), was duly installed in the [Museum of Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/1c64t2/the_first_comment_ever_made_on_reddit_complains/), and noted by an Admin in an [Announcements post about the history of Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/84nyj6/a_shortish_history_of_new_features_on_reddit/):\n\n&gt; They launched commenting. (The first comment, fittingly, was about how [comments are going to ruin Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/17913/reddit_now_supports_comments/c51/).)\n\nBut it was not the first Reddit comment.\n\nThe post by /u/Nutshapio mentioned above ([Reddit now supports comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/17913/reddit_now_supports_comments/)) originally linked to [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/17844/illegal_immoral_and_pointless_the_new_york_times/) that contained an even earlier comment, this time made by /u/bugbear on the same day at 10:41:59 UTC (two hours before /u/charlieb's comment):\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/17844/illegal_immoral_and_pointless_the_new_york_times/c26/\n\nNote that /u/charlieb's comment link ends in \"c51\".\n\n/u/bugbear's earlier comment link ends in \"c26\".\n\n\"c\" presumably stands for \"comment\", so I am searching for the comment ending in \"c1\" - the first ever Reddit comment. Or, if that doesn't exist, \"c2\" etc. I am looking for the lowest number that exists.\n\nI am hoping that some of you Redditors might be able to find it with Github (or perhaps even an Admin with their advanced search functions) and help me clear up this mystery.",

        "text": "If culture flows from the way people interact with and within the physical environment, then the tools we provide within the physical environment of reddit will be the only way to affect cultural change.  Right now we have up and down votes, which are blunt instruments of judgement.  But, they're used in so many ways, because the bluntness begs refinement.  An up vote can mean, \"I support\", \"I approve\", \"I agree\", \"That's funny\", \"Nice ass\" and \"I'm so sorry for your loss\".  Down votes have equal range.  Comments allow us to refine the message of our vote and now flair allows us to position our status, votes, comments and selves within the community.  All of these tools are available within subs, and used to make subs effective in their missions.  A further set of culture shapers are the mods.  These members have tools that I am just learning, and they are powerful. But regardless of the sub, or mods, Haters hate, Laughers laugh and Admirers admire all using the same tools.\n\nIn the past few years I've noticed that the tools are becoming complex enough to change the overall tone of Reddit.  I've lived on Reddit under one username or another since just before the day's of Narwals and the great Orangered/Perrywinkle war.  I've abandoned Reddit several times because of massive downward collective spirals around Ellen Pao and during US elections.  But, now there seems to be a bit of a ballast to the boat and sites like r/happy and r/CasualConversation seem to be able to survive without being crushed by the blunter tools and cabals.\n\nA few weeks ago after lurking on these gentler sites I got thinking about the natural connection reddit has to the news and political cycles.  Infrastructure type sites have been built to instantly link us to and drive us into real-time conversations in these larger issues.  But, I'm wondering if reddit can be used to create culture around our daily events such as sleep and bowel movements.  \n\nFor example, what if there was an easy way to let reddit know you were going to bed.  And, those online, or within digital earshot could receive the message and say then \"tuck you in\".  Would this humanize the site?  Would a tool like this let shift workers in Australia better connect with office workers in California?  What would happen if all the people going to bed at 18:00 GMT just knew where to go to offer a kind word to a fellow human just before they drift off to sleep.  Would this softening tool lead to a softer reddit?  Could such a tool even exist?  \n\nWe all know that everyone sleeps and we all like to be tucked in, so how can we create a cultural connection to the physical reality that one part or another of reddit is ALWAYS GOING TO SLEEP and, in the same way one part or another of reddit is ALWAYS EVACUATING THEIR BOWELS.\n\nThese are things I'm going to play with.  If you have thoughts or want to help reddit tuck each other in or track bowel movements, let me know.  The subs are very basic but are being built now.  r/nitenite and r/1or2 .\n\nEdit: spelling and grammar",

Another thing everyone knows is that typically Reddit shows the most popular posts by default. HOWEVER  topics that are disagreed with are unlikely to get high ratings thus possibly preventing the opinions to reach the people who would agree and be interested in these opinions. So what solution did Reddit come up with. The controversial feed that shows you unpopular, constantly changing opinions. So, if you're looking to hear some opinions you agree with it might be worth trying the controversial feed",
