Open minded about marrying again if I met the right person. That said, I’ve never been someone who *needs* a relationship so if I never had a relationship again it wouldn’t be the end of the world. I tried online dating briefly but was pretty easily put off by all the idiots who seem to just be on there to hook up. Is this everyone’s experience of these sites or have I been unlucky?\n\nMore generally, have any of you found yourself in a position where you were open to meeting someone but didn’t want to online date? How did you meet your partner? Or if you are still single, how do you meet people who are looking for relationships? \n\nTia :)",

        "text": "So I’ll start by saying I’m an only child and I’m childfree by choice. I’m also an introvert and enjoy my alone time and am a homebody most days. I’m 41 and have been married for 7 years. My husband is unmedicated bipolar and been in an episode for over a month now. Before that, I had already made plans to fly home to my parent’s house for Christmas. I’m off work for 2 weeks, husband is not working but started an intense IT program earlier this month and isn’t getting a lot of breaks this week. So since my parents are getting older and live in another state, we decided I’d come alone this year. So I had already planned and booked my trip before his episode started last month. \n\nI was hoping being back home would help him miss me, would help me get my mind off things, etc. But here I am with my typical boomer parents driving me nuts over everything and still getting one word texts from my husband. He has a strained relationship with his family after years of abuse but he actually went to Xmas dinner with them. He’s home taking care of our cats and probably still depressed, but won’t really reach out to me. \n\nI am going to see a couple college friends this week while I’m home, but otherwise just feel very alone. I have a handful of best friends but none live near me. I currently live in a small beach town with mostly retired people; it’s been hard to make girl friends and I also just started a fully remote job 2 months ago which I like but has me socializing even less. \n\nI know we shouldn’t allow other people to control our feelings but I’m finding it very hard to not feel alone when my husband is withdrawing from me. Then coming home just listening to my parents bicker with each other and argue with me over nonsense hasn’t helped. I wish I had a bigger group of friends but don’t even know where/how to meet women at this point in life. I can say I have one true friend where I live now and a couple other friends from my last job, but it always seems like everyone else is busy with their own families. And my best friends live in other states. My husband is generally introverted like me but has more friends since we live in his hometown. \n\nHow do you make friends later in life and/or how do you not feel so alone (if you’re single or have a spouse with mental health issues)?",

        "text": "I’m sorry if this post is annoying or against any rules. Christmas stress probably isn’t helping. I’m just feeling downtrodden today and could use some lifting up. \n\nMy husband and I are in our mid 30s/early 40s and been together for 11 years. We’ve been really in love for most of that time, like a super happy couple. Best friends basically, we spent most of our waking time hanging out, laughing,  loving just being together. Before we had a baby, one of my biggest fears was our relationship quality would tank. I’ve read the studies, the Gottman books, everything points to the MAJORITY of couples having a decline in marital satisfaction.  I was hoping it wouldn’t happen to us; we read books, did pre-baby counseling, had a great split in house chores, etc. My relationship gave me so much meaning, was the aspect of my life that I was probably most proud of. Spoiler alert, it happened to us too. \n\nI’m in love with my baby (he’s 11 months now) and love being a mom, but whether I feel “in love” with my husband is questionable. We bicker most days, barely have sex, etc. We have plenty of downtime for quality time together but we (mostly me) choose to spend it separately. I don’t know why, I’m just not drawn to him like I used to be. I’d rather just be alone and watch my shows or read. I do know that I’m stressed and irritable, and he’s helping mitigate that (he’s improved a lot on the invisible “mental load” stuff, we’re doing counseling still, takes the baby and gives me plenty of alone time) but for some reason I just feel this constant irritation with him, and him alone. Not the baby, not my friends, no one else but him. \n\nI know it’s early still, but I just need to know that it can get better. Some studies say it only gets better after the kid leaves the nest but I really don’t want 17 more years of this. I just want my relationship back and I’m afraid it’ll never be the same.",

I had sex with this guy who told his friends about my butt hair, and they teased me about it saying, \"oh did I forget to shave my ass?\" and laughed hysterically. It was humiliating and it still gets my anxiety going to this day, 15 years later. (I was mistreated by that group and shouldn't have been intimate with one of them, but that's another issue)\n\nAt the time, I hadn't shaved my butt yet, but I was shaving my vulva. I remember it being pretty long. I don't think at that time I really even KNEW that people were shaving their butts. I couldn't imagine putting a razor in my crack! But now I'm panicking about how weird it must have been to shave only my vulva and not my crack. Also feel dumb for not thinking about how visible everything is when you're doing doggy style. I'm absolutely mortified.\n\nBut nobody talked about it! I feel like the last person to ever shave back there. And it makes me feel absolutely gross. Was everyone else shaving their butt cracks during the time they started shaving their vulva? I remember talking about shaving with my friends at the time, but no one ever mentioned their butt. It makes me think maybe it's not all that uncommon to just leave your crack hair, but I just got terribly unlucky with an awful guy who decided to talk about details of our sexual encounter. Also thinking to myself maybe most people are okay with a little crack hair, but mine was probably so long, that it was in 'gross' territory.\n\nI could use some support from fellow women. I end up spiraling about this every once in a while. Right now it's affecting me pretty severely and the embarrassment feels extreme. It makes me feel uncomfortable in my own body and I feel so weird and disgusting. I feel sick to my stomach. \n\nIn my desperate attempt to find some similar stories, I searched reddit for posts about this. I came across a comment where a guy said he had sex with a woman with a shaved vulva but completely hairy asshole and how it was a huge turn off. Soo that just added to my awful feelings.\n\nI'd like to hear from women for some support and reassurance that I wasn't a total weirdo for leaving my butt hair. Or if you have any similar humiliating experiences because I feel super alone in this. I know it's easy to say the right guy won't care, but this experience just really traumatized me. Clearly some people care and they're willing to humiliate you about it. Do I just need to learn to laugh it off? Please help me get over this.",

        "text": "I’ve posted this on a couple of other subs but wanted r/askwomenover30’s take. \n\nWas wondering about people’s thoughts on this. I’ve had crushes on people who were unavailable (gay, in a relationship etc). I would try to put myself out there to date others (eg a dating app) but it never seemed to work that well. The guys I’d meet were perfectly nice but my feelings just weren’t there at all (I guess that’s the nature of demisexuality - we need time to experience sexual and romantic attraction). And my mind would be so focused on the person I had a crush on that I just couldn’t get particularly interested in anyone else. I find that I really need to meet people “organically” in order to develop feelings and for a relationship to happen. When I get crushes, they tend to last about a year before they run their course. Sometimes shorter if I’m around them a lot and realise that our personalities aren’t compatible.\n\nSo that’s my question. Do you think that there’s any point in trying to date others when you have a crush on someone specific? My take is that it’s good to try to meet new people, knowing that the more people you meet, the more likely it is that you’ll find someone you click with. But for me personally, dating apps just don’t work. Maybe I’ll try them again if I feel really desperate for a relationship. I’m fairly young (24) so I’m not too worried at the moment.",

While I believe that a person does not have the right to hear my whole complicated past, I don't want to lie either. \n\nAfter giving it a thought I replied \"With boundaries in place, yes I would say we're close.\" And I left it at that and changed the subject. \n\nIf you have CPTSD, or a complicated family past, how do answer that question? Or even if you just want to be honest, but also not give your story away, how would you answer?",

        "text": "My (28f) boyfriend (39m) of almost 5 years gifted me an electric can opener and a tire inflator for Christmas. He is traditionally not a great gift giver, but I hoped this year might be different. I asked him what he wanted ($70 headphones) and so that’s exactly what I got him. I mentioned to him that I would love to get a professional massage. Now I didn’t expect that he would necessarily go through and make the reservation for this, but even giving me a gift card towards it, or getting me a different thoughtful gift that has to do with one of my interests or hobbies would have been nice. It makes me feel like I’m not special to him or worth getting something more personal and thoughtful. I don’t know if it’s even worth having a conversation about my feelings on this anymore, because I’ve had the conversation with him in previous years when he’s giving me other appliance gifts like a handheld vacuum. Should I say something? In our relationship he is insistent about all bills and expenses being paid exactly 50/50, which is why I view Christmas as especially meaningful because it’s one of the few times in a year he is spending on me and has an opportunity to do something romantic.",

        "text": "Hi. Just looking to know I’m not the only one. I’ll be spending Christmas alone, just like Christmas Eve. My bf and I live together. We’ve been dating two years. He is a serial poor planner. He is with his family an hour away, which I couldn’t go to because he told me they were driving to another city for a few hours, and this city I have PTSD from so I don’t go there. I asked him to spend it with me instead because we went there last year and we go to their house all the time. But he got upset and said I was trying to tell him not to spend time with his family. He promised he’d be home by early afternoon today because he was going to wake up early. I tried calling him for a Christmas good morning a while after he said he would be awake. He’s asleep. He always sleeps in. Then he’ll need about 3 hours to fix his car with his dad. Then he’ll take another hour or two to chat with his mom while she makes him breakfast/lunch. Then with the weather he’ll take a good 1&amp;1/2-2 hours to drive back to our home. I work early tomorrow so I’ll probably only see him an hour or two for Christmas. He promised me the best Christmas I’ve ever had. \n\nI’m running out of good reasons to be okay with this. I feel like nothing to him. He gets to spend a warm Christmas with his wealthy family while I stay home alone. I pay all the bills and we have no food at home but he gets to enjoy all of their food all day and yesterday. I feel like shit because I’ve eaten ramen. And he knew all of this going into it. But he has ADD and can’t focus long enough to realize this is exactly how his “plan” would play out. I don’t know how much longer I can take him and his mom telling me, “He’s just stressed and has a hard time remembering things, he didn’t mean anything by this or that.” \n\nI cried all day yesterday and this morning. I don’t want to be a jerk who isn’t understanding of his ADD because like I noted I have severe PTSD which comes with a lot of diagnosis. But I genuinely believe this could have all been avoided? I feel so uncared about which was the opposite I wanted to feel from my significant other. I’ve been abandoned or abused by those who were meant to take care of me my whole life and he couldn’t take that into consideration when making his “plan”. I just feel defeated. I’ve spent most Christmases alone and it looks like this one won’t be any different. \n\nTo hear stories from you guys or just words of encouragement would be nice. Hope it’s not too many of you have been through something similar.",

        "text": "Hi everyone. I really didn’t know where else to express this. I (34F) got divorced a few years back, then 3 years ago, I met someone else and had to leave because the relationship was physically, sexually and mentally abusive. \nThis relationship was so bad, I had to relocate abroad to try and start fresh. \n\nBeginning of this year, I met a man and thought I’d finally get a good partner with whom I’d be able to build something, but it didn’t work out. He broke up with me 3 weeks ago. His reasons where that from the get go he was pushing to move forward in the relationship when I really wanted to take the time. Truth is, I told him I was still working on myself and really liked him but needed a little bit of time to know him and feel safe. I didn’t tell him about the abuse and childhood traumas I went through until I was a few months in and for him this was the main betrayal in the relationship. This led to our fair share of fights. \n\nHe also used to say that my « traumas » were making the relationship difficult for him, that I was too independent, and didn’t make him feel like my priority at all. That I don’t know how to live a man because I didn’t have a dad and a proper family. And even though I am positive and in a good mood most of the time despite all that happened to me( his words), he fears for me I will end up alone and childless because at my age it’s getting way more difficult etc etc.\nThat if I just “shut up and listened more” , we probably would still be together. \n\nLong story short, he didn’t feel his needs were met, he was unhappy and after threatening / leaving multiple times, he ended up leaving for good.\n\nThis time I’m not chasing him, I wished him well and will follow my own path. \n\nBut it’s tough. I never really doubted meeting someone, but this time, these 2 relationships in addition to my failed marriage really make me question if I ever will find someone who loves and cares for me. Who doesn’t see my past as a burden and who listens to my needs. \n\nChristmas and New Year’s Eve are especially tough this year. I wish I could celebrate with a good partner, knowing my kids are on the way.\nMost of my friends are in relationships / have kids and celebrate with their own families. It makes me feel so lonely.\n\nI went to a family Christmas Eve party yesterday and I could feel the judgements: you’re 34, not in a relationship, moving countries, no children. “How come she looks like that, have this and that and still no one wants her?” Someone even told me “ohhh you’re 34 ?! you’re not old old but I mean your not young anymore”. It really got me depressed a good part of the night.\n \nI wasn’t expecting the break up, wasn’t expecting another lonely end of year. \nAnd I am ashamed to say that while my mother was so happy I was celebrating with them (hadn’t been in a few years), smiling and looking at me. I was contemplating ending it…on Christmas’Eve. I had to pull myself out of the idea the best I could. But the pain was so tough. \nI am just more and more scared to end up alone. \n\nPlease excuse the trauma dumping. I am\njust in a lot of pain and can’t talk about it to anyone.",

I will leave this house, and I will drive off, and I will not come back.\" And I took my drink and walked off. \n\nWhat I didn't say and should have, was that I spent 2 hours today mopping up water on my hands and knees and shutting off pipes to my aging grandparents' house.

There's a big meal cooked by my sister, gifts are exchanged, and the grandkids perform a Christmas play. Earlier in the afternoon, I started to get a headache so I took a nap. Woke up with a near migraine. I told my mom I wasn't going to be able to go celebrate with them. She was instantly crestfallen, saying who else is going to record the play, in her just a little off-mom way. I stated again that I was sorry, but I just couldn't go. The time between me telling her, and then heading out, there was just mildly-tense air between us. My mom tends to get passive-aggressive when she's up. As they were leaving she said goodbye and that there wasn't a lot of food in the house, so she doesn't know what I'm going to eat, and then she walks out. \nI'll admit, there was a part of me that was relieved not to be going tonight. I'm still trying to find my feet underneath me. The breakup was less than a month ago. I love my family in the way you love a family that you have a complicated relationship with. I don't know. Part of me is sad to be missing the festivities. I know that I would have laughed and had a pretty good time. But an empty house feels like a beautiful thing. I'm always very conscious of not getting too mellow (hello MDD) and locking myself away from the world. And I feel guilty for letting my family down by not being with them, I know there will be resentment on their part...\nI'm not really sure what my goal was for this post. Maybe to just reach out and say 30 is not looking like I thought it would. People always tell me that 30 is so young and that I have so much life to live. But as someone who had an 11-year-long (3 dated, 8 married) relationship with a man, and then a 1-year relationship with her first woman, I feel like I have just lived so much longer than I actually have. \nSorry for the kinda downer post. I'm doing fairly well in reality! I started seeing my therapist again. On okay meds. Have a few close friends around. But this Christmas is just way different than I could ever have imagined.",

        "text": "Having a pretty terrible Christmas so far. My husband and I both have elderly parents who live on opposite sides of the country we prioritize a lot so we never spend Christmas together, we split up so we can be with our parents. \n\nMy parents are selling my childhood home to move closer to my sister in January so this is our last Christmas here. I really wanted my husband to come spend one Christmas here with us so we agreed that he’d fly here on Christmas Eve. He didn’t want to fly earlier because today is also his mom’s birthday and he felt guilty missing both Christmas and her birthday. \n\nWell his flight was canceled because the airline over booked. I realize that we probably should have seen this coming, so please spare me the lecture. \n\nI’m devastated he won’t ever get to spend a Christmas here. On top of everything, my dad told me last night that he’s leaving my mom after they sell the house. I don’t blame him, they’re both miserable and my mom has a severe mental illness and addiction problems that she refuses to get treatment for and it’s been really hard for my dad to take care of her while she’s verbally abusive to him. But obviously this is really crushing. He hasn’t told my sister or my mom yet. So I’m just alone with the weight of this horrible knowledge and I really need my husband right now. \n\nThe airline couldn’t rebook him until Wednesday and we’re scheduled to leave Friday, so I told him not to come. It doesn’t make a sense to fly for six hours just for a less than 48 hour trip. \n\nI’m just so devastated. I can’t stop crying. I go so far out of my way to prioritize my family because they never prioritize me so I would never see them if I didn’t. I’m so jealous of my sister who gets to spend Christmas with her husband every year. Who my parents are both moving to be closer to. They keep talking about how we’ll do christmas at my sisters house from now on, so everything will always be centered on her. And even when I try to arrange everything to feel like I’m part of this family, I can’t win. \n\nI don’t even want to go down for dinner or participate in Christmas tomorrow. It’s just going to make me feel worse. I just want to stay in my bed and count down until I can go home.",

I definitely do not feel like I'm the same person as when I was 30. Any other women notice a significant change in mentality before and after a certain age? I imagine for many women, it may be before/after kids.\n\n\\-------\n\nI'm early 40sF, never married, no kids. When I was under 40, I was really adventurous, taking a lot of trips. I grew up with a restrictive childhood, so after age 25, I started trying a lot of hobbies that weren't available to me before, like hiking, skiing, camping, backpacking, cycling. I would join an organized multi-day bike tour at least once a year and do several outdoors trips throughout the year. I was in a serious relationship at 28 and he proposed to me, but I wasn't ready to get settled down to the traditional lifestyle of marriage and kids (which is what he wanted).\n\nIn the last couple years, I did some out-of-state trips, but I just came back feeling rather unsatisfied with the experience. I joined organized trips where I didn't know the people in advance. For many of these trips, the people were nice, but it just felt like after I came back, I still lacked social connection. I have an out-of-state trip and international trip planned for 2023, but I'm starting to feel like I should just stay local and do more with local groups to build more social connections. I'm not close with my family.",

I don’t mean to sound arrogant, it just seems for what ever reason, I’m attracting more “equal matches” in real life situations than I am on apps (maybe it’s being over 30?). \n\nWould love to hear some tips! Or which dating apps you successfully met someone on (but please only offer app suggestions if you met your partner off the app at 30+). I go based off IRL vibes more so apps burn me out more but im still open to suggestion.",

Wanted to know if you think I’m being too picky or rigid.\n\nSo I invited my friend W to the party.  W and I don’t know each other too well but we used to work together.  She came to a party at my house about a year ago and has invited me to their place a few times but the dates have never worked out.  I was excited that she planned to come.\n\nA day or two in advance W texts and asks if her husband can come.  Of course I say.  She later asks if a couple friends can come too (I’ve met the husband but not the friends).  I say sure thing the more the merrier.\n\nSo it ends up that W and her husband 1 friend come.  The husband is great.  W and the friend just get soooo drunk/stoned.  They are basically incoherent.  W did ask before they started smoking if I was ok with weed use outside and I said sure.  I guess I just didn’t expect them to get to that level.\n\nI just kind of feel taken advantage of.  Like, I don’t get drunk/stoned around people that I don’t know well.  Partially bc  I don’t want anyone I don’t know we’ll to have to take care of me.  I guess not everyone feels that way and W’s husband was there to take care of her.  But he was in another part of the house most of the time.\n\nAnyway, I mentioned being a little annoyed to someone else at the party…and they seemed to think I was over reacting.\n\nWhat do you think?  Would you be annoyed?  \n\nFwiw most of my friends are late 30s and w is almost 10 years younger. \n\nI think my plan in the future is not to invite her to my home…we can meet and do things other places but I just don’t feel like having people that inebriated around me (unless that is like something we are all doing)",

        "text": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/zqvyk7/needs_discrepancies_in_relationships/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nAfter my first post a few days ago I got so many helpful responses and input that I wanted to provide an update. I think I’m also posting this in an effort to hold myself accountable. Something I’ve realized about myself is I tend to self-abandon, and hold on to “potential” and the fantasy of the partnership that I want, ignoring reality and letting my needs and wants be pushed further and further aside for the sake of keeping the fantasy alive. I also have tended to sacrifice my own comfort for the sake of his comfort and have avoided hard truths (like the reality that we have vastly different needs and that I feel lonely) to avoid “abandonment” or ending the relationship. \n\nAfter my last post and after a lot of time thinking, I was kind of at my wits end. I’ve expressed to my partner many times that several major needs of mine are not getting met consistently in our relationship. Not only have I not seen significant sustained improvement in these areas, but I also feel like I’m the only one putting in effort to find solutions and to communicate. \n\nWe ended up having a long discussion about this and at the advice of this community for the first time I really laid all my cards on the table. I told him I’m really not happy. Not like, today or about something recent or about one topic but in general I’m not happy and my needs aren’t getting met. That my emotional and sexual needs haven’t been getting met for years and that as things stand we are not going to make it. I told him I feel lonely the majority of the time and that I feel unseen by him, like he lives in his own little world and doesn’t seem to realize how his actions or inactions impact me. He comes across as self centered and inconsistent and oblivious to my needs despite having communicated them multiple times. \n\nI told him he’s also a wonderful human and I do see and appreciate the things he does do for me / us, but that he also feels a million miles away much of the time and that he avoids deeper intimacy with me. That we don’t get nearly enough quality time and that we haven’t made any progress on our sexual issues and he rejects all my suggestions for helping me feel desired and satisfied in that area yet comes with no suggestions of his own. And most crucial of all, that we literally do not talk. We chat plenty about our day, about work, family, etc but unless I force him to sit down and engage in a serious discussion about our relationship we never go beyond surface level topics. If we don’t even really talk, how can we ever work out our bigger issues? I’m sick of carrying 100% of the emotional and mental load in our relationship AND still feeling like I’m this needy crazy person for wanting to talk to and have sex with my partner. I told him I’m so unhappy that even if we stayed together and got married, which we plan to do, unless something (a lot of things) changes we will be divorced in 10 years. \n\nI refuse to sign up for that. I refuse to self-abandon. I refuse to settle or accept the status quo or good enough. \n\nHe was a little defensive at first but thawed after a bit (and after I called him out on being defensive and how unfair it is) and was ultimately receptive to everything I had to say. He seems to understand how serious this is and has been much more present and communicative and more like a partner than a roommate the last few days. What’s yet to be seen is if he truly gets it and can make lasting and sustained change and truly show up for this relationship. I do not want to be his mother, his leader, his roommate or even his friend, I want to be his partner. \n\nWe agreed on two specific things going forward as a first step toward repair:\n* once a week scheduled sex dates where even if he can’t “perform” (I don’t love this term but for lack of a better word) we have some kind of naked physical intimacy \n* once a week scheduled focused one on one time to discuss progress on our issues, delve into deeper relationship / intimacy topics, discuss what is and isn’t working / just overall state of the union\n\nI’m cautiously optimistic but more than anything a huge weight has been lifted off my chest by admitting to myself and to him that this is not working. I am more afraid of a continued life of complacency than I am of facing the harsh reality of a breakup. And I’m so proud of myself for that!",

Example, I really like anime and because i'm 32 I don't have the right credentials because I haven't seen Akira(For those not in the know, it's a very popular anime movie and while lots have seen it, other haven't. I personally am not interested in the art style so it's not high on my priority list)  \n\n\nHe also had the nerve to wear a Texas hat into the office the morning Woe v Wade was overturned.   \n\n\nAnd he feels the need to talk to me to \"boost my self-esteem\". I have a very nice social life outside of work and so I'm pretty quiet at work, not to mention quite busy.  \n\n\nThe topic he's brought to others around me is guns. It's a hobby I suppose in his eyes and he doesn't talk about it inappropriately per se, but it does make me very uncomfortable.   \n\n\nBecause it's just making me uncomfortable but he's not being inflammatory about it, is this worth bringing up to HR? Or do I just need to deal with it since it's his hobby? Just wondering if anyone else has any experience navigating this type of thing.",

        "text": "I feel it’s important to note that my boyfriend and I have a very healthy relationship, we rarely argue due to very clear communication. \n\nI recently flew home for Christmas, and my boyfriend was to fly home a few days after me. We are celebrating Christmas separately as both of our parents are older and it’s important for us both to be home with them. He is an only child, and I have 2 siblings. His flight kept getting delayed and then was eventually cancelled. He didn’t think he’d be able to make it home for Christmas. I offered to help pay for half of any flight he could find, and he denied the offer by saying he wouldn’t let me do that. I said I wanted to and would love for him to be home for Christmas with his family, and he denied the offer. I had updated my parents about the status of his flight, and knowing that he’s an only child and how much his parents would probably miss him, and also not wanting him to be alone for the holidays, my parents asked me if he might accept help paying for a flight as a Christmas gift from them. He said that he would be uncomfortable with accepting that but thank you. I stopped offering, because I noticed his responses were shorter and less “him” if you know what I mean. He stopped responding, and the shortness continued to today/this morning. Luckily, the airline was able to provide another flight so he will be going home. I said how happy I was for him, and I apologized for potentially making him uncomfortable by offering to help pay. He said he forgives me as my intentions were pure. \n\nI’m just a bit confused. My family is not wealthy. We do make a bit more than his parents. I also make a bit more than he does, but this has never been a topic between us. I tried putting myself in his shoes, and I understand how offering to pay might make someone uncomfortable, but, mad? I’m not sure how to approach this. I also feel a bit offended, because my parents and I just really care and wanted to help. We would do it for a stranger if it meant being with family for the holidays. Is it bad that I / we offered? Is it right for me to be a little peeved that he’s mad at us for doing so? How do I help make it right? I want to respect his feelings, I’m just not sure where they’re coming from. Thanks ❤️",

        "text": "In my early 20s I was with a great guy, let’s call him Jack. We were SO in love, we were one of those couples that just radiated love everywhere we went. Everyone around us would comment on it, we just complimented eachother so well and worked well together.  It was my first big love, and his. We’d both cared about others but this was so different and tbh I have never felt anything like it before or since. We were together for 3 years until I sabotaged the relationship horribly because deep down I never really felt like I deserved such a great guy, and I was a bit of a mess and dealing with a lot of depression and mental health issues that even the happiness of our relationship couldn’t hide. It was a really beautiful relationship that I was just not quite ready for. \n\nSince we broke up, I have mostly moved on, but tbh I have never really let go in my heart. I have been in other long term relationships but it’s always felt like I’m comparing everything to Jack deep down. And nothing ever quite measures up. He’s been with someone for years so I’ve respectfully butted out and never tried to rekindle things, but over the years, even as recently as 5 years ago, we have both kind of admitted we thought of each other as the “love of our lives” and both still felt something for one another. I have always held onto the hope that some day, just maybe, we’d find our way back to each other. It’s the only outcome that’s ever truly made sense to me. \n\nI met someone new 5 years ago and we are still together now. It’s the closest I’ve ever felt to how I did with Jack and I do love and care for my partner deeply. I see a future with him, and I dream of and hope for that. I’ve been mostly happy in this relationship (though certainly not without it’s baggage) and promised myself I wouldn’t sabotage it and let what happened with Jack happen again. \n\n95% of the time I’m happy with where I am. But there’s always, consistently this 5% of the time where at the back of my mind, and heart, I’m always feeling huge loss and sadness over how things turned out with Jack and dreaming that we will be together again some day. I’ve still never felt anything like what I felt with him. I still occasionally cry about it and I’ll have 1 or 2 days every year, without fail, where it’s all I can think about and I feel huge yearning and longing and heartache. It still all feels like such an open wound.\n\nWell, last week I found out he’s expecting a baby with his partner. I always felt like as long as we weren’t marrying or having babies with other people there was still this distant chance we’d end up together again some day. I know how awful and unfair that sounds on my partner and I know it doesn’t really make sense considering I do actually dream of a future with my partner too. It’s very confusing trust me…\n\nIt’s been almost 10 years since me and Jack broke up. I’ve never truly let go and now I’m realising rather suddenly that it’s over-over. Forever over. And I don’t know how to deal with that but I’m trying. How the hell can I finally move on 10 years later? Do we ever get over our first love? Do we ever feel the same again? Or is it normal to forever feel like nothing will ever quite measure up? I don’t know how to switch off this part of myself that’s always compared everything to Jack and secretly dreamt of a happy ending. Every time anyone talks about the love of your life, I think about him, not my partner. He is my “great love”, the one that will forever be etched into my heart, and despite how great my love is for my current partner it will always be overshadowed by the past. I’m sorry if that makes me sound like an asshole but it’s true.",

        "text": "Well, I'm currently in week one of a breakup. Oh, and I'm also just coming out of a bout with covid (it's my first time getting it). It's been a GREAT week, sigh. And of course, the holidays are here. Anyway, first, here's the story: \n\nThis relationship, which was never defined but progressing to something serious, was short-lived (5.5 weeks) for a total of 4 dates (we saw each other about once a week, sometimes every week and a half, due to his schedule). It's the closest I've gotten to someone in literal years. We got on so well, were always honest and genuine with one another. The consistency and communication were there from the get-go and throughout. He was several years younger than me but was established and doing well for himself. Buttt things went haywire at work for him. He had been communicating that for a while, and we both work in the same industry so I know how volatile things are right now. Long story short, he told me he was checked out of the relationship at times, uncertain about his job security and by proxy wasn't sure of us. I was empathetic and understanding. He left it up to me if I wanted to proceed and while I was willing at first, after about a day I realized I couldn't continue to invest in someone who was unsure of me. I told him as much. Also said I understand he has his reasons, but I have my reality. \n\nI guess what it came down to is that I realized I was prioritizing his needs over mine and I was losing myself in the process. I've been down this road in one way or another before and knew I couldn't let it happen again. He was understanding, and about a day later I texted to say if and when the dust settles, he could reach out if he wanted to. He actually originally suggested this when we had chatted the night before, so I thought what the heck, why not. I won't wait but I'll keep this door open. The way I see it is that things ended because it was just a matter of bad timing. \n\nNext, here's my breakup formula: \n\nI always abide by the 30-day no-contact rule which includes no social media stalking. I've also deleted his number so I literally can't reach out to him even if I wanted to. I'll be with family for the next few days but intend to take up a new hobby and continue on with my life which already involved healthy habits such as the gym and yoga. I also need to make a point of making new friends (recently moved to a new city and I'm still establishing myself). I also plan on rejoining a creative writing group I used to be a part of that meets once a week. On the work front, I'm about to sign on a new client so there's that. Oh, and I'm already in therapy, have been for 3 years and counting! Think I'm doing pretty well for myself so far but would appreciate any additional tips/pointers/advice/kind words! \n\nTL;DR navigating an unexpected but somewhat amicable breakup after a short-lived relationship. It was a matter of bad timing as he was in a volatile place work-wise. I've currently gone no-contact and am looking for ways to \"fill my cup\" during this time to get myself back on track. Would appreciate any tips/advice/kind words!",
