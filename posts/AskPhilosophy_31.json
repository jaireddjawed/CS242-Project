While so many people are calling for the blood of those who've done such things, our societies (mostly) seem to be concerned with punishing these wrongdoers only ever temporarily. Sometimes lightly, sometimes even with the concern that they may need to be educated and given proper jobs. \n\nWhy do we do this?\n\nI'm not against those kinds of things. I'm actually quite for rehabilitation, therapeutic practices, and work programs for prisoners. \n\nBut why do we do it at all? Why help those who've hurt? So much of what we call justice, we ask for those who've done what we call evil to be harmed. We want them to be hanged, beaten, murdered, etc. So why do the nice thing for these guys and help them at all? \n\nI haven't found a good answer for this, despite my own desire to help people who are criminal. I actually have a deep desire to help those society calls wrongdoers, but I can't ever answer to the rage that others feel towards them.

This forces people to be limited in their freedom. This certainly brings a lot of cons. Yet what I am trying to point at is the fact that while we may think that a seculair state is a great solution to a theocratic state it is not always the case. For me personally there does not exist a perfect form of a state. I highly defend freedom of speech and expression. Limiting these in my mind severely handicaps a humans proces of mind.\n\nFor example, if we strictly believe that morality is subjective, who dictates who's morality is valued most, and should thus be objectified? Who decides what is wrong and what is good? Have we not in the west created our morals, have those in the east not created theirs? Who says which one is correct and which one is not. While for us two this may seem obvious for many it does not. So in what way does a secular state differentiate form a theocratic state. One has rules based on religious texts/messages while another is written by man and could be argued to have the same origins?\n\nI know there are highly intelligent people here and many of you definitely have thought this through but can we give it some real thought?

What is considered a fair way of gauging that? \n* In a high-tier academia (think top universities) how much is it a student's responsibility to catch up to their smarter and more gifted peers, given the overall level of courses is difficult and professors' expectations are high (not inhumane or unrealistic though)?\n* Should those hardships be considered a consequence of one's conscious choice to try and access the best academic resources and get a higher than average education? Or should institutions dedicate more resources to help those capable and passionate enough and yet struggling students? I saw my peers how breakdowns, taking gap-years, having to take ADs and tranqs. They made it through, though, but was it worth it that way? And whose fault is that?\n\nOr maybe I am asking the wrong questions, and it's an entirely different set of problems?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My perspective**\n\nI was a momma's straight-A boy, who then went to a decent university to get a hard-STEM degree and found himself struggling to stay average. I also worked with school students and even was a leader at a summer camp for gifted kids interested in STEM. I and fellow leaders would sometimes discuss what makes a kid exceptional and whether this warrants sacrificing resources for other less talented.\n\nI myself struggled to live up to my own expectations of a straight-A student, giving up my health sometimes. I ran into very helpful and down-to-earth profs and top-tier scientists, that would be genuinely surprised at how we couldn't grasp what seemed a basic concept to them. I ran into very gifted, smart yet condescending students, as well as amazing people who fell behind but had great passions outside science. \n\nOverall, this led me to become much more compassionate and empathetic towards people. Some even say I'm too soft. I also grew to despise people who look down on those not as smart or academically successful as they are. But maybe my attitude is very subjective? Or unjustified? Or not utilitarian? \n\nSo what are your thoughts?",

It constantly creates and replays and alters these little movies in my brain. There are small minutes when I think what I believe to be normal stuff like ‘I need to get Katie this for her birthday’. The only time my brain stops and quiets is when I focus on a task like homework that needs my focus. \n\nIs that not normal? BECAUSE NO ONE HAS GIVEN ME A STRAIGHT ANSWER AS TO WHAT THEY THINK!!!\n\nIt’s also not a problem really. Just gathering information to see if this is just me or not and the closest thing to a response I’ve had so far is ‘that sounds like autism’. I was also told to post this here!",

For most people, the reliability of their senses is an axiomatic starting point from which they base their epistemology. But I can't have that luxury. I, like everyone else, ultimately only have access to that which I perceive, but I can never be certain that what I perceive actually has any bearing to the objective world (if such a thing even exists.) So what can I base my epistemology on? Do I have to become some sort of solipsistic idealist and only affirm the existence of my perceptions and swim around in my own mind? Do I just say \"fuck it\" and believe whatever I want or works for me because either way I can't know anything for sure? And is the difference between my lack of certainty and the average person's only a matter of degree rather than kind? Thanks",

I want to write about a conversation I had last winter when I was skiing and shared the lift with a stranger who was a teacher in the sciences. He was intellectually curious and started talking about ideas that he couldn't believe people thought, and cited the quote that is on the license plate in New Hampshire: 'Live Free or Die' and I shared with him the whole quote which is from a letter by Gen. John Stark: \"Live free or die. Death is not the greatest of evils.\" \n\nThe stranger replied, 'I just don't believe that.' \n\nI wish I could have asked him what he does believe but the lift came to the top of the mountain and we skied to opposite sides. \n\nSo I ask all of you thinkers to maybe step into his shoes and surmised what makes up a world view where there is no evil worse than death? And why does he think it is ridiculous that people could believe that there could be something worse than death? What are the philosophical underpinnings that would lead someone to scoff at this? I hope to sincerely consider possible reasons for his comment in an essay. \n\nHere is an article about it to get you thinking about possible responses: [https://patch.com/new-hampshire/nashua/what-does-live-free-or-die-mean](https://patch.com/new-hampshire/nashua/what-does-live-free-or-die-mean)\n\nSo what say you?",

        "text": "I feel like Nietzsche’s Eternal Return, or the idea that you’re going to keep living the same life over and over again, is not only plausible but makes more sense then the idea that consciousness ceases after death. It’s gotten to the point that when I hear others talk about how death is eternal oblivion it seems silly to me. \n\nThe number one reason I believe Nietzche’s Eternal Return is almost definitely true is because of something I’ve never heard anyone talk about before. You see, if you’re reading this right now you’re alive and conscious. If you were nothing for billions of years and will continue to be nothing for an infinite amount of time after you die, statistically you should not exist. The odds that you just \\*happen\\* to live in your one little window of consciousness right now are beyond astronomically low when compared to the literal infinite amount of time you’ll be spending not existing. You should be dead by now. But Nietzsche’s Eternal Return solves this, because under that theory consciousness is a constant. \n\nI think it makes logical sense that we are 3D Creatures in a 4D World where the past, present, and future are all happening at once. We’re locked into the present because of the limitations of our own mind but in true-reality our birth and death are equally both equally happing ”now”. Therefore, once our brains ability to maintain consciousness ends in our subjective timeline it reverts to the beginning. \n\nI know it’s silly for me to have this much confidence in this theory, to the point where it’s my reality, but that’s why I’m asking philosophy for reasons there may be to not believe it. I’m not looking for objective proof that can debunk Nietzsche’s Eternal Return, just counter arguments from others. Reasons why this doesn’t make sense or reasons why other theories just make more sense.",

I hope all are well. \n\nI was wondering if someone could assist with a question I had.\n\nIs there a specific term or designated categorization for someone who responds to a single, initial question/morality inquiry with loosely related return questions that eventually allows the asker (initial inquirer) to reach his/her own conclusions based on the subsequent answers he/she provided? (In an interaction between two or more individuals)\n\nI always thought it was the Socratic Method, but I just read a few things about it and, although similar, there seem to be some differences but I could be mistaken.\n\nTo provide a very simplified example: Say there was a teacher and student. The student poses a question to the teacher. Instead of directly answering the question, if there is a definitive answer, the teacher poses a series of related questions for the student to answer. Thereby the student comes up with his/her own conclusions for their initial posed question.\n\nTo greater simplify:\n\nStudent asks a teacher: what is x if 3x=6? Instead of the teacher telling the student the answer, he/she might ask the student a series of questions such as \"would it be correct in saying 3x plus 1 would be equal to 6 plus 1? If so, would it also be correct in saying that 3x divided by 3 would be the same as 6 divided by three?“ etc.\n\nThis is a straight mathematical scenario, but can equally be applied to philosophical discussions. Is there a given label for such discourse? Is there a specific individual who initiated such exchanges? \n\nThanks for any thoughts!",

        "text": "I am getting from other questions asked and answered on this subreddit, and from some essays I've found online that the point of Wittgenstein's treatment of 'pain' is that the term, as used, is not necessarily linked/defined (?) by the sensation. Rather the social role the word plays is relevant for its use (right?).\n\nIn PI 297 the point is made that to imagine someone in pain we needn't imagine the sensation being there (right?).\n\nI don't get the role of 298-9. \n\nIn 300-2 then it is shown that the imagining of pain is not so much the imagining of a sensation, but can be done in many ways. We can imagine ourselves having pain, we can imagine someone having pain but not showing it, we can imagine someone behaving as if in pain (it either being true or not). But none of this has much to do with what our sensation of pain is, I take the point to be (right?). But if that is right, I fail to see that that is the case. If someone is kicked against the shins I 'feel' pain in my shins. I can imagine seeing someone being kicked in the shins and having an empathic reaction. \n\nThen in 303 the point is made that saying 'I _believe_ that person is in pain' (as opposed to 'he is in pain') is just a way of speaking that seems more apt to us, but rather mean the same thing. We don't go around seeing people get kicked in the shins and then doubting their pain (right?). But, here then, the pain sensation is paramount for the definition of 'pain', no? It is not solely the reaction that the victim has that makes us perceive him being in pain, but also that we have been kicked in the shin in the past, and we've seen others react, etc. etc. So, what is the 'grammatical move' being made here?\n\n304 then says that the point is that we can't really say anything about the sensation of pain itself to eachother (right?) and that we need to rid of the idea that language (in the case of pain) is about conveying thoughts (or sensations?) (right?). But what then _are_ we doing when doing pain-behavior? Aren't we conveying that we are in pain and perhaps need something? In asking this I have the idea I'm completely missing the point here, but I just fail to see _where_. \n\nThen in 305-6 W asks why not just say that we are 'remembering something' instead of 'we are going through the mental process of ...' (right?).\n\nAnd then 307 he says that he isn't a behaviorist, but that there is something with our grammar. I just fail to see what.",

        "text": "About 10 years ago when I was in school, a logic professor mentioned that universal statements and do not entail existence (and vice versa). Google seems to agree with that. \n\nFor example, \n\n The equivalent statements *no one in the class is studious* and *everyone in the class is not studious* \n\n~∃x[Cx &amp; Sx] , ∀x[Cx -&gt; ~Sx] \n\nare both (vacuously) true if there is no one in the class at all. As such, a universal statement doesn't entail existence. \n\nHowever, it seems to me that I can derive *someone exists who is in the class* from the statement *everyone is in the class*, which appears to be inconsistent with the professor's claim that universality does not entail existence. \n\n1. ∀x[Cx] \n2. Cf (universal instantiation: 1) \n3. ∃x[Cx] (existential generalization: 2)\n\nGranted, the form of my counter-example is different from the example the professor provided. Maybe that explains the apparent inconsistency. However, I suspect that I'm just misusing the rules of inference. \n\nI checked the book that I'm self-studying from, and I couldn't find anything that said I misused the rules. \n\nWhere did I go wrong?",

I'm reading de Vitoria's lectures for my PhD in the theory of international law, but I'm so confused about his concept of 'necessity' when it comes to the order of natural law (*jus naturale*) and the order of international law (*jus gentium*).\n\nWhat the hell does he mean by various degrees of necessity and something being a necessary cause?? Where can I find more research on this? Should I read Aristotle?\n\nThank you",
