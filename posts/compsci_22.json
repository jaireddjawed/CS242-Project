Please help.\n\nIn my code as you can see the 'shortest_path' function gives just one path. I cannot seem to get all the paths from this function as I do not really know how I can do it. I have searched a lot on the internet with search engines for working code for same, but unable to find any.\n\nThanks",

The variable p is not further defined.\n\nNow I've received the task to calculate the probability that there will be a data loss in this RAID 1+0 system and I have literally no idea how solve this.

However, he said I could use whatever language I wanted.\n\nGenerally speaking, I am more comfortable with Java than Python at this moment. However, I am wondering if this class may be easier if I just brush up on Python and forget about Java - even though Java is more lower level and I would assume might be easier to do this sort of stuff in Java. \n\nHere are some of the things covered in this class: divide and conquer algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, computational geometry, and linear programming. This is not everything, but it should give y'all a good idea.\n\nWhat do you guys think would be the easiest route for this class? Java or Python?\n\nThanks ",

        "text": "I posted this to the weekly thread with no replies, so I thought maybe it'd  get more visibility here:\n\nI read an intro to a book for compilers, and in it the author made a great note that compilers is a microcosm of CS. E.g., to write one, you'll need to understand (to some extent):\n\n    1. Graph/ lattice theory for writing useful static analyses.\n    2. Grammars and automata theory for the front-end work.\n    3. Parsing theory.\n\nIt's beautiful in the sense that it combines so many areas of math and CS to produce such a prevalent and integral tool in the software world.\n###Other microcosms?\n\nWhat are some other areas that produce common and core tools in the software industry that can be viewed as a microcosm of CS ideas? Some possible examples off the top of my head (although I'm out of my depths) I'd love to here people's thoughts on are operating systems, blockchain, databases, and maybe even web development. ",

        "text": "It may sound bold but I want to self-teach math to a moderately high level, and I want to learn to code as well.  I know that coding can really help you learn math, and working all those math problems would probably be a great way to practice coding, so I figure it would be good to learn these things in parallel.\n\nI have moderate education in math.  Nothing substantial, just high school math up to algebra 2/trig (I flunked precalc mostly because of laziness but perhaps in part because there were holes in my foundation), and college level stats.  I want to start over and build a foundation, so I’d like to start with a coding language that lends itself well to basic problems and algebra first, and then maybe something else (or something that does both?) when I get into higher level math.  I also want to get a very strong foundation in stats because I plan to be a research professor.\n\nI’ve done my own research and found some suggestions, but I’m still unsure of the best course of action for my particular needs.  Can anyone help?\n\nAlso, if it makes any difference, I plan to do research in psychology and neuroscience.  I may go into psychiatric epidemiology in some form.  I wouldn’t even be opposed to going heavily into computational neuroscience (I may minor in it) as far as things like machine learning, brain-interface or mapping the brain.  Maybe I could learn a language that would also lend itself well to some of these things when I get there?  I’m sure those computational neuroscience applications probably vary wildly in their type of programming, but I just thought I’d throw it out there.  And I simply want to learn math for its inherent value to thinking and seeing the world.\n\nEdit: For clarification, I'm not suggesting coding or computer science involves learning a lot of math.  Really what I'm saying is that programming skills can act almost as a study tool for learning math subjects and ideas.  A lot of advisors suggest math students learn to program as well.  I'm not really sure how this process works to be honest, because I know little about coding, but apparently it helps with visualizing problems and grasping the ideas behind them.",

Fortunately I am able to use my universities library to access a lot of these books for free (saving me a lot of money!), but they are mostly eBooks which I really dislike (my crappy eyes stare at that damn screen enough as it is).\n\n\nIs there an existing business that facilitates exchanging textbooks? If not, how is this not a thing? I would be willing to pay a decent subscription + donate books to such a service, I am sure many students would in fact.",
