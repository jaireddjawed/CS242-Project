As of yesterday, I’m pushing myself out of the house to try new things too. It’s almost like I’ve missed big parts where people have these intense imaginations, and I just can’t muster that.

        "text": "(it takes me awhile to get into the juicy stuff so bear with me here haha)  \nSo, this might be an odd thing coming from a guy, but this is weirding me out/annoying me to the point where i feel like its time for me to ask others for advice. So, im a second semester sophomore at the moment in college, 5'9 20 years old, and im dorming this year and i dormed last year (I also transferred here during my sophomore year). last year, i lived in a different dorm than i am living in right now, and i mean it was nice and all, got along with my roomates and people on the floor, but it was kind of far from classes so i decided to move to a dorm closer.   \n\n\n I also made a couple of friend groups last year, one of them lets call BAT group. Me and bat group got along, and eventually I got to meet some of their friends, one of them being DD (lets call him DD for now). DD was kinda awkward kinda shy but yk he vibed with the group and i didnt mind him, so everything was fine. hes also 6'2  \n\n\nThen second semester came, and i moved into my new dorm room, and it just so happened DD was on the same floor as me, (1 room down) and a other friend from the BAT group (one room down other direction). At first I was happy to know i knew people on the floor, and for the first week or two yk i was friendly with them, said hi when passing by, asked both of them if they wanted to start a DnD campaign, yk made small talk, but thats about it. I mean Ik DD from one of my actual friends from BAT Group so i was just trying to be nice, but i didn't actually know the dude/was friends with him. But yk i wouldn't mind being his friend, until he started acting weird.   \n\n\nIt all started when my roomate moved out, and now i was a single in my second dorm room. One of the first things he did that was sort of questionable was that like second week in the sem (keep in mind i still bearly know the guy) dude knocks on my door, i open it, we say hi, and then proceeds to invite himself into my room, (i was busy working on homework at this time and really wasnt in the mood for a guest) and proceeds to sit on my bed and watch tiktoks for 1 HOUR. I didn't want to be a dick and be like yo get out, and im also a little socially awkward myself and im not used to that sort of confrontation, and thought if i just didn't talk and was the most bland person ever he would leave or pick up i wanted him out, but no, just watched tiktoks.   \n\n\nEventually, i was like hey im trying to get this homework done could you maybe come back another time? which he begins to do, gets to my door, and does one of the reroutes and is like, \"hey man what you working on\" which he continues to make small talk for another 15mins before leaving. Really annoying, but its whatever, ill just keep in mind that next time if he invites himself in my room ill just have to ask him to leave sooner. That same day, he proceeds to knock on my door, two other times, which i open it, he lets himself in, and goes on his phone and \"attempts\" to make small talk. Which ofc, im not having it, and this time within like 10 mins i ask him to leave. He even touches and reorganizes my stuff when he invites himself in  \n\n\nI thought this would give him the hint, but no. I gave him my snap chat last semester, which he continuously asks me to do stuff. \"hey man do you want to see this movie\" \"wanna go get dinner\" \"what are you thinking about right now.\" I have friends, i know what like trying to remain in contact is like, this isnt that, this is obsessive. He replies to everyone of my stories, knocks on my door like 4-8 times a day, every time we have our \"small talks' he always throws in somewhere how he likes me, or how im so likable, and other bs.   \n\n\nOne time when i was going to my dining hall, he saw me and yk proceeded to say hi. Then was like, \"you gonna eat now?' I responded in a way to get away from him, \"yeh in like 5 mins i got to call my brother first\" which he said \"ok but you better sit next to me when your done\". I leave the dining hall, wait for 10 mins, get in, sit down on the far corner, where i see him actively searching for me for 30 mins before he finds me, and ofc, sits down without even asking.   \n\n\nIts gotten to the point, that since he lives on room down from me, he can hear whatever im doing in my room, that whenever i play my piano in my room, or put on music, he waits for it and almost like a que will come to knock on my door. Today, he knocked on my door 6 times within 6 hours, and im getting sick of feeling like i have eyes on my 24/7 from some entitled narcissist who wants me to submit to him for some reason. I get that he might be lonely from him being socially awkward and needs friends, but cmon this isnt how you go about it.   \n\n\nBut all of this isnt even the worst of it, he knows im in a single, and has mentioned many times \"hey can i move into you\" coming up with all kinds of random reasons on why he needs to. Such as, \"oh my roommates are too noisy i need to move out and your the only other room on this floor that i like, so it has to be you.\" or \"oh my roommates or so messy, your not, it makes alot of sense for us to be roommates.\"  or whatever reason he can think of. I have already told him a firm no saying i enjoy my single and i dont want a roomate, but he continues to ask. Im scared that one day he will just do it, and move into my dorm room without asking me, and i will be forced to live with this creep, which tbh im not comfortable sleeping at night being in the same room as him.   \n\n\nI would also like to mention that he is 6'2 and i am 5'9, so making him angry with me and getting into an altercation is something i want to avoid. But also i cant let this continue. I have already began ignoring his constant door knocking/entitlement to me opening it because he knocks and have told him a firm no to him moving in with me. Maybe tomorrow, i was thinking of telling him to stop knocking on my door in either a nice way or a \"hey dude your weird stop it now\" way, not sure. But at the same time, i dont want him to have a problem with me since that will make it very awkard hanging out with my friend group since he while not super active in it is apart of it and might make them stop hanging out with me, which i dont want. I dont want to tell an RA since idk i feel like that over complicates things and in reality they probably couldn't do anything. its not like they can make him go to another floor or something. But anyway, what would yall do?",

Our relationship is also FWB , and we used to have feelings for each other in the past, but he didn’t want to be tied down at the time. \n\nTwo weeks ago we hung out like normal, he bought me snacks and we had sex, watched movies and he took me to a local mall (we love window shopping and going to the arcade). There was nothing wrong or anything and he even suggested we meet up soon to go watch a movie he wanted to see. \n\nHe texted me back one and a half weeks ago because he had left something at my house, and I told him I could drop it off at his place and it wasn’t a problem (he doesn’t have a car). He told me he was busy but didn’t offer any time to get it back. It’s time sensitive so I thought he would have needed it back by now.\n\nI sent him a meme like a week ago, and asking if he’s okay and he left me on sent. It’s very unusual for him (he sometimes goes 24-48 hours without replying back but that’s kinda rare). It’s been almost two weeks and nothing. I texted him again tonight, he’s on social media and seeing my posts but he’s not replying to my messages? \n\nIm getting worried that he’s mad at me for something, or idk. I guess I just need some help calming me down.",

        "text": "Just recently, I had this dream that I was friends with this certain acquaintance. And I was intrigued by why all of a sudden she pops up to me when I haven't spoken to her since six months ago.\n\n-- \n(TLDR: The OP started talking with this acquaintance again and wanted to continue where we left off. But OP is anxious because of what happened in the past, and the mistake was introducing her to a connection with an \"ex-friend.\"\n--\n\nSo to my context here, I was talking to this acquaintance, whom I met through a friend of a friend way back. She introduced me to her because we all have so much in common. \n\nWe met her through an online game. Back then, I still had my old circle of friends surrounding me. And probably the mistake that I have made is to introduce her to one of my ex-friends.\n\nIt was a short moment that we talked about things with the 'other' friend because we are playing together back then. As time went on, something happened to me with this 'Ex-friend' causing me to completely cut this person off.\n\nTwo months after that incident happened, I still try to make a connection with her by just showing up online at the game. We usually talk about things related to the game prior and have some casual talks about our lives. But I was having a major change at that time because I was focusing on my priorities. \n\nAnd one time we talked about friends. And I briefly mentioned to her that I and this \"ex-friend\" were no longer friends. She was sad about it, and she also talks about her group of friends and their strong bond. I was afraid to share more about it because of the trauma caused by this ex-friend, and I might think that at some point they talked about me and made negative impressions on me. (Me and this ex-friend did not part on good terms.)\n\nAlthough I admit I was a bit toxic back then when I was with the ex-friend I was hanging out with. And to be honest, I think that hinders me from having a connection with this acquaintance. I felt bad because I don't have much confidence to work it around that time. But now I've been changing myself for the better.\n\nAs much as I remember, she had mentioned that we should be hanging out sometime and added me to her Discord account to talk about playing other games. But it never happened, and I guess life just happens between us.\n\nTime had passed, and I hadn't had a chance to talk to her for months. I have a hobby to keep me on track, and I casually update it on my social media profile. She has seen some of my stories about it. Then suddenly, one time, that \"dream\" just appeared to me. \n\nAnd now, I think I'm confident enough to approach her again by sending a message, although I have yet to see her response. I know it takes time to have a response from someone, and I'm anxious about it since it's been awhile.\n\nDo you guys perhaps have an acquaintance story that turned into a lifelong friendship? I would love to hear your story.",

Sometimes you may be at one gathering and someone brings up say a movie/show they recently saw and if others are like oh they want to see it, some may right then start to organize an outing to see it. If not, now you have an opening to follow up with some people - start a group chat and say hey who wants to see \\_\\_\\_ on \\_\\_\\_.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaking friends does take time and effort. Going to meetups or other events consistently is a good start and you will make acquaintances that way. If you want to turn people into friends, try to follow up and see if they want to meet up to try a restaurant you want to try, see a movie, go for a hike, or some other activity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have also noticed that sometimes if you are the first one to suggest doing something together outside of the normal context, even if they can't make it/are not interested in that activity, they may at some point invite you to some event/activity. It might not be right away - it could take a few months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is tempting to say that you fine with whatever (ie restaurant to try). It may be that you really are open to all options. However, that puts all the work on the other person. Instead, try to come up with a few options. One thing that can work is have everyone suggest an option, and then each person eliminates one option.",

She even sent me these long texts about how much she appreciates me being in her life and that we would be doing this together forever because we understood each other on a deep level.\n\nShe would sometimes take a week or 2 to respond to me and recently said she was having a rough week so she wanted to be in a better headspace before responding to me.\n\nBut she left me on seen a month ago, and since then I've sent her 2 more check ins with no response. Last week she was posting on social media hanging out with other people.\n\nI'm a little blindsided by this and I'd like to chalk it up to her being in a difficult state but she seems fine hanging out with other people.

Some people were happy to hear from me after a long time and planning to accept me into their lives, then abruptly change their minds and cut me off. Maybe they just don't think I would fit in their lives after such a long time, and they don't like that I don't have many friends now.",

I want to start taking the car out more, not just for the commute, but to drive around or go to new places and meet people. This is also a good thing for me to take it out more so i don’t stay at home a majority of my days, and i become more independent.\n\nI recently started driving more often last fall just for my commute to classes.  and I wouldn’t say i’m a bad driver at all, I’m just decent i’d say, but i just sometimes get anxious sometimes still about things such as parking, or switching lanes in moving traffic, or if i’m gonna take too long in a stop sign and get beeped at for missing open looks, or if the roads just confuse me sometimes and i do something wrong. \n\nI still get anxious pulling up to college sometimes  and making an driving error in front of people since i go to a commuter school and i know these people. It’s to the point where i don’t even park next to anyone in the parking lot , and i just don’t wanna do some bad parking or take too long to park when theres other cars behind me too, so i just park back and walk further. \n\nI guess also i just feel like if i make an error or something or miss many open opportunities to turn in front if people, that I’d just feel like they think i’m slow or something\n\nWhy do i experience this anxiety about driving by myself sometimes?",

        "text": "**Building a social circle and putting yourself out there**\n\nThis is a guide on expanding your social circle. If you're introverted with low to minimal social skills, I suggest you read up on other social material elsewhere before you dive into this.\n\n* If you get invited to a social event, meet as many people as you can, show them your personality and have an interesting conversation. Get their socials and stay in touch. The more people you know and casually talk to, the more likely they are to invite you to a social event and also meet people that can be your good friends.\n* Throw your own social event or share your invites with other people.\n* If people are busy, keep showing interest until they eventually wanna hang out. Keep sharing until you see disinterest or say no multiple times. Gauge interest and reciprocate it. Double down on the people that are interested but don’t be too clingy.\n* If you are the person that shares social invites, chances are you will be invited to the next thing. If you are not invited to the next thing and that’s okay.\n* After a social hangout, individually message all the people you got a chance to talk to and you liked. Just say sth like “Super nice meeting you yesterday, we should grab drinks sometimes”. This shows genuine interest and can set the tone for future interactions. They might or might not show interest, and that’s okay.\n* Follow them on Instagram. Reply casually to their Instas stories and have a quick chat, message them every few months here to check-in.\n* Fake it till you make it. Pretend you are very social at a party and talk to as many people as you can. Don't be scared of rejection when you invite people to social events or talk to them at a social event, it happens all the time. Keep going until you are able to earn from compound returns.\n* Don’t say no to more than 2 invites in a row- it takes &gt; 3 cancellations for people to stop inviting you over.\n* Keep exercising the social muscles until you practice them like art.\n* Ask them out of a bunch of drinks next time. When you do this, you're able to meet them and deepen the relationship as a meeting that is not loud and rowdy like a party.\n\nWhen you do put yourself out there, you end up making new friends that you can rely on overtime to give you more opportunities for social interactions, and hence, eventually expand your social circle. Talk to as many people as you can and put yourself in as amnesty socialism situations as you can. You can read more of my thoughts on changing my social image [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/pojpx2/changed_my_social_image_over_a_summer/).\n\nYou can also build and nurture new relationships with the people you vibe well with and eventually form a new friend group with the people you think will get along well. This might seem hard but it has worked well for me in the past and I would love to keep doing it and share feedback and what works for you.",

        "text": "I've always been quiet, alone and never really know what to say. I also get social anxiety. The last time I had friends was in early elementary school, switched schools and haven't had friends since. I feel like I missed out on a lot by not having any friends in middle/high school. I seriously don't know what friends do, talk about, how to interact, what people do when they hang out, what to say etc. Especially because the last time I had friends was in elementary school and the topics and activities will be different now. \n\nFor the past year I've mostly been at home not doing much, I play sports once a week and have minimal social interaction there. People can pick up on me being socially awkward, anywhere I go people notice. I used to think it was just in school and if I went to a different place like a sports club (multiple) then it would be different. But I'm still the same, I'm awkward so people are awkward around me. I also often get the fated question \"Why are you so quiet?\" The real answer for me is that I genuinely don't know what to say. \n\nIt was only recently that I realized I don't actually ask people questions or initiate conversations. And if somebody initiates a conversation with me my answers will usually be short and I never asked any questions back. Lately I've been trying to at least ask \"And you\" or if they asked me something about my weekend I'd ask them \"What did you do this weekend?\" It seems small but I really didn't do that before. I still don't know/can't initiate conversations because of 2 reasons: 1) anxiety, 2) lack of social skills.\n\nPlease give me some tips/advice because I don't want to be like this forever, especially now that uni is coming up and if I don't change it's just going to be the same all over again. Are there any books I can read, videos I can watch, things I can practice or say, mindsets I can have?",

        "text": "I know this is just me ranting but:\nEveryday of my life is just a drain off energy. From morning too night. From the second I open my eyes too the second I close them. I dread waking up because there is no reason for me too wake up. I have lived like this for the last month. \n\nBefore this I had tons of motivation and I made tons of progress in the job market, which I am now about too lose which I honestly couldent care less about. I made these progresses because I thought money would make me happy, but I have nothing too use it for. I dont care for a house, I have noone too share it with. I dont care for a cool car, a boat or anything because there is no fun in it and I see no use in it. I have noone too show it off for or noone too have fun with.\n\nI have no dreams, no prospects. Just empty days which feels like black holes draining all energy and positive feelings I have. \n\nIam wondering if this is normal with ADHD which I am pretty sure I have. (Also the reason I am not in school and instead working. I can not for the life of me open a book again after HS.) I had a severe case of it when I was a child, and I feel like its worse now except for hyperactivity. Back then I couldent stand still and had the energy of 10 people, and could talk endlessly. Now I have no energy and without caffeine, having conversations is hell. I just cant for some reason talk, without chugging 2-3 energy drinks. Energy drinks is the only thing that makes me feel somewhat normal.\n\nBut Iam just at a point now where i dont know what too do. I feel like turning too cocain just too feel something again and not having every day being a drag too get trough. I kinda get why noone wants too be my friend, because I am a miserable person. Atleast I have been lately, I bring no energy in conversations or too my workplace. \n\nEvery small extra work or responsibility in my workplace is met with a sigh from me, Iam probably the worst employee when it comes too engagement and commitment. Only reason I am not fired is because I am one of the best salesmen. I even told my boss that I dident care about this workplace. xd\n\nBut social anxiety is ruining my energy. I wish I could just exist in the moment without having a 1000 thoughts constantley putting me in a bad mood and queastioning my every word and action. And I feel like cocain could do this for me even tho it would fuck up my life. I just cant keep living like this. \n\nThe few moments I have had where I have been sorrounded with friends I trust and high on alcohol and energy drinks have been pure bliss. Being able too open myself up, be myself and live in the moment is better than any feeling cocain would bring me. I long for these moments and its everything I want but It only happends maybe once a year. But thats everything I want. Not having too worry about anything and be free of my anxiety. \n\nIt feels like having your pinky finger in heaven, but the rest of the body in hell. I get a small touch of what it feels like too be normal, but It only happends once a year and the rest of year is miserable. I get a small touch of how others are living everyday.  Not having too use all your energy too maintain a conversations and spending 90% of your brain power wondering if you said the right thing, filtering your responses, and hoping the other person likes me, and trying too think of what too say. None of my conversations are natural except for that one day because it all has too be forced by me.\n\nIdk why I wrote this, any advice?",

My teacher told me to go w them bc we done the previous group work together.  \nI made a power point and that one chick started berating about it. I already said it was okay if we didn't have to do a power point and she continued, then got offended bc i responded to her...  \nI sat by myself to avoid confrontation, bc i'm at university to work, i don't have more time for petty problems.  \nBut she told me to be useful, but said it in a rude manner. I responded to her accordingly and she got mad.  \nThe other girl who's also in the group, started playing victim by claiming \"at least she made the effort to make friends w me. W you it seems like we're placeholders\". \"You got into the group without asking, and taht's how you thank us ?\"   \nI'm not gonna kiss their ass bc we're doing group work together. First off it's the teacher who told me to get w them. The point of working together is putting differences aside to work twds a common goal. Doesn't matter whether you're working w friends or not. And compalining that someone doesn't want to make friends w you is nonsensical. If they don't make any effort, that means they don't want to, period.  \nShe also said that we were already excluded from the rest of the class. When she herself never made any effort to get to know them (the rest of the class already had an established friendship from preivous years). I wanted to tell her that and say the world does not revolve around you. Claiming that people you've never talked w are \"*excluding*\" you is just playign the victim, and such a reach  \nBut i just said smthg to appease whatever tension there was bc i didn't want to witness more emotional meltodwns/diatribes. \n\nI thought people in college would be more mature, but here they are thinking anyone who doesn't kiss their ass is \"excluding\" them or whatever.

Feeling like a worthless piece of shit l. after graduating my family didn't let my go to other city for better opportunities. Because my brother had gone immediately after i have completed my degree and leave all responsibilities of home on me. We are only two brothers and dad got retired some time ago.\nDad had made some shops at their prime and give it on rent and he doesn't know how to drive so basically I became his driver and my life is going to square 1. For the past 4 years they tried to get me jobs is those areas that aren't related to my field of studies. Basically I am living in one of the small city in Pakistan where it sector isn't flourished and i have very less opportunities working in my field. So from the past 4 years i am out of field and nearly disconnected from my social circle as so i have spent my entire life (before graduation) in the company township wher my father had served his 38 years of life. After retirement of dad's batch of people my all friends of childhood had gone to big cities and i am stuck here without friends... \nAnd some time ago i tell my sister the girl i like but my family firmly rejected her... \nNow i am getting depressed to what to do with myself\nAt every visit my big brother try to impose his ideas on my to chage my field of work , some times he say you should do YouTube, some time he says you should do digital marketing or become  a Amazon virtual assistant. And my mom always listen to him and always recommend me to do as he says.\nI wold sometimes listen to them and when a work on one field he would started saying i should do something else... I am feeling like a jack of all trades and master of none. Now i have isolated so mych my self that after coming home in evening my social life is zero and my mental and physical health is getting affected after this depression\nNeed your advice how to cope with this all situation and get myself back from it and i want to get back my lost confidence and and grow my social circle to improve my life style.",

But I feel my reaction was inappropriate. Though appropriate at the same time, seeing that he doesn't really wanna elaborate on this.\n\nWhat do you think I should've done?

Maybe they did not, maybe it was in my head, but I always assumed my classmates, coworkers, etc. saw me as a loser ... but I have worked very hard to improve myself - get a better career, stay in shape etc.\n\nThe upside is I feel like I have a good work ethic and try to be more accepting of others, the downside is I always feel like I need to somehow prove myself to people - like I need to do all of these things or they will not accept me.\n\nSo when people tease me or bring up embarrassing things I did years ago I will get angry - not so much being offended but more like frustrated - like I worked so much harder than these people to improve myself but they still see me as not good enough.\n\nFor example if I had to work a lot of overtime a few months and gain weight due to stress eating people might joke about. I know they are joking and will laugh along to be polite but will internally get angry because I feel like they still see me as less than them.\n\nI guess I am trying to change this mindset but maybe because I don't really banter with people I have trouble understanding people's motivation in doing so and am maybe misjudging their intentions.\n\nMaybe I am dismissing people who could potentially be a good friend due to this mindset.",

I'm thinking of getting her a couple tubs of melted chocolate cereal treats, because I'm 100% sure she will like it.\n\nHowever, I'm really health-conscious myself, and I try my best to avoid processed food and added sugar. That's fine and all, but the thing is, I tend to post about healthy living on my social media, and obviously she sees all of it.\n\nOn the one hand, I don't want to be a hypocrite by preaching healthy living and giving her these very sweet treats, and \"enable\" her sweet tooth. She has joked about me \"enabling\" her before, when we were at the grocery store together and she was asking for my opinions about the chocolate snacks she was getting (I didn't really know how to respond at that time so I was just like \"Well, if you like it, get it\"), which is why I'm a bit concerned.\n\nOn the other hand, it's her birthday so I think she should get what *she* likes. Plus, I don't want to look like I'm trying to impose my views on her, or be a nag. I'm sure if she wanted healthier gifts, she would request it. So should I get here these melted chocolate cereal treats?\n\nI did consider other chocolate and chocolate-themed options (gourmet, candles, stationery, jewellery etc), but they were all too cheap or too expensive. This one is affordable enough for me and something I know she would definitely like. \n\nFriendship context: We've been friends for years, I consider her a close friend but we only meet once a month or so, and can talk about most things under the sun.\n\nI'm leaning towards getting her those cereal treats, but I wanted to know what the more appropriate thing to do is!",

        "text": "Throughout my life, I've never really had a good social outlook. i've always been bored and unfulfilled and wanting something more every day. throughout middle school I was alright, I never really got in trouble but I was not social with anybody. I knew due to them being busy with sports hobbies or just other people. All I ever really did was focus on stuff with no benefits whatsoever. I have a huge fear of losing people, when I was seven years old, my mom passed away of pneumonia, and right now my dad is 59, a drinker and got diagnosed with stage 2 prostate cancer in early 2022, my brother is almost 18, 350 pounds, and autistic. And things only got worse my freshman year of high school, im in second semester of my sophomore year now and its not getting any better. I hung out with a lot of bad influences and lost focus on my grades and almost failed freshman year after a stupid decision i made, brandishing a gun and showing my 'friends' on snapchat and i almost got arrested and had to go theraputic day school for almost a month. when i got back from the incident, things calmed down a little bit and i finished freshman year with almost all Ds. I joined sports for the first time the following summer. I was thinking maybe joining football would help me forget all about my problems. it did, for a little bit. As soon as school started again, I felt like I wasnt going to fuck up. Until one day in  october, literally two days before a JV game i got called in for, me and my teamates were fuckin around in a group chat and I made a snap pressuring my brother into saying the N word. The next day, the video got leaked throughout THE ENTIRE SCHOOL. I got suspended for 5 days while my brother only got 2. My friends and teamates lost all respect for me and I never got to play for the rest of the season. When finals for first semester of sophomore year, I failed my geometry and chemistry classes, and now cant get those credits back. I spent all of winter break wondering if I even have a purpose in life when all I ever do is wreck everything for myself and others. \nI am currently in second senester of sophomore year and I feel like a burden to everyone i know. Nobody fucks with me and im a total fucking loser. Where did I go so wrong with my life? Im too young for this, Im so lost. I want to feel loved and like I belong somewhere.",

        "text": "When I was a child, my parents failed to socialize me properly, and I was pulled out of school before I had the chance to make friends. Since then, I have not had a chance to make friends face-to-face. The only times I can leave the property is when my parents decide to bring me with them to shop for groceries. I can't drive, and I am not allowed to get a job.\n\nAdditionally, I have suffered from anxiety and depression since I was a child due to abuse. There was no acknowledgement or validation from my parents in regards to my need for help. \n\nAs a result of all this, I struggle heavily with social interaction. My parents will on occasion make me order my own food or buy something and pay for it at the register, but when they do this, they'll be beside me talking for me or over me the entire time, and not really allow me to say anything for myself. When I do poorly in a social interaction, they usually get onto me, which has brought me to tears in public before and always feels very humiliating.\n\nMaking friends online is probably the easiest way for me to get social interaction. And since I can do it alone from the comfort of anywhere, anytime, it SHOULD be a piece of cake, but I struggle just as much with it. On occasion a friend will invite me to call with some of their friends, but when I join, I stay quiet, and freeze up like a deer in the headlights. After the call ends I'll feel physically ill and will have only said maybe two words the entire night. \n\nIt feels like I can't make meaningful connections with other humans. I feel like an alien, and each failed interaction feels like it sets me back further than I can make up for. If anyone has tips for how to deal with this, it'd be greatly appreciated.

        "text": "I know it seems obvious but hear me out. I understand that when sharing personal details I need to differentiate between random people and people I consider close to me. But the fact is that I grew up in messed up conditions, the majority of my family has passed and if there are some living relatives of mine, I absolutely do not consider them my family. \n\nIt keeps happening to me that my colleagues are asking how I celebrate holidays that are usually spent with family. I need to add that I do live in Europe. So they are expecting actual answers with details on what I got my parents for Christmas, Mothers/Fathers day, how we spent Easter and what traditions we have, and so on. I also often go visit a friend in my hometown but my colleagues keep asking me if I also went to visit my family (our work group is basically a bunch of friends and I started there recently). How do I make it clear that I do not have a family and do not want to talk about this? I tried telling them that I'm not close to my family but when pressured for details I just said that they have passed and the reaction was quite negative. So what do I do next time - do I keep lying to make other people comfortable?",

        "text": "In my opinion it's about my personality.  I am really reserved and quiet most of the time; having fun with me is nearly impossible when there's no planned activity that is fun itself. Though I do like deeptalk, i can't articulate and express myself irl (which is no problem while texting) and thus my conversations are rather superficial; they don't hold for long and the other person gets bored easily. \n\n I do ask multiple questions to many things they say, which keeps them talking, but as soon as the question is over I again don't know how to really respond most of the time. This leads to me asking more and more questions to keep up anything which is tiring for the other person and not enjoyable anymore. \n\n I don't know what to do really, because i don't want to be dependent on planning stuff all the time only to spend some hours with one another. I try improving my expressing (?) but it's damn hard. \n\n And additionally I never find someone to sympathize with; we're too different (not the problem itself), which for me is pretty interesting to get to know, but it's more like reading an autobiographic book rather than having a conversation and spending time in reciprocity (if one can say so). I'm not sure if it's understandable or not. I just simply can't connect to people, no regards of spended time, \"conversations\" etc...",

Which has helped me become more calm and collected irl\n\nI can also meet people from all over. So I don’t feel as lonely anymore 😪 \n\nBut of course my social skills are still lacking and I have a lot more to learn",
