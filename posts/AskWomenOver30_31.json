        "text": " I have a general sense of what I want, what I like, and what's right.\n\nI feel really lost and just going through motions after her passing.\n\nI have general stability, but my life is not yet where I feel things are setup for me to flourish.\n\nI   have a job, but it's not where I want to be forever. I could not  afford  a house, become a professional, or climb with my company. It's  an  average position with average benefits. I have not taken time off  since  Dec. 8th, which I took a day, but my boss was irritated I left 45   minutes before my end of shift to renew my car registration. I always   have to negotiate time off for doctor's and dentist appointments. I am   always told \"we're a family\" and it's \"about the team.\"\n\nI  have a boyfriend, but he's not showing me a maturity or work ethic I   want any potential kids to emulate. He's brilliant - he has a   doctorate's in electromagnetic - but he uses paper plates because he's   too lazy to wash the dishes. No dishwasher. I would not feel comfortable   splitting a mortgage with him.\n\nMy   family stopped talking to each other after my Mom's passing. It wasn't   even a fight over a will. We just all went our own directions. I have a   stepdad, but he's not involved. There was a fire in our town, and he   evacuated but never messaged us. I feel weird going home, even though I   technically have an address and room there. I moved in with my  boyfriend  after my Mom passed and would stay away from home. While I  was gone,  2/3 of cats went missing. I think he wasn't letting one in  and not  feeding the other. I grabbed the last one because he was  leaving him  outside in the winter. He is confirmed to have NPD.\n\nI  was really consumed by school, work, and my Mom. I did not make any  efforts to branch out or establish other friendships. I am pretty  isolated.\n\nI received a scholarship  for my studies. It covers my tuition. I'd love to get a graduate  degree. I also want to live abroad for a bit. My current position covers  bills, but I'd like to find an internship in what I've studied.\n\nI  just don't like not having anyone to ask about things, like financials,  parenting, relationships, and careers. I am nothing new in history.  Things seem straightforward and easy so distantly -- everyone has to  tackle subjects they're uncomfortable with and grow - but having no  point of reference to check against and protection from predatory  situations is very daunting.\n\nDoes  anyone have any general recommendations or perspective from this  situation? How did you work to secure yourself and excel? How did you  ground yourself? What worked best?\n\nPeople that don't relate -- please call your parents if things are good with them! :)\n\nI took for granted the fiery, witty, and wisdom of my Mom, and I just miss her phone calls and perspective in general.",

        "text": "My husband and I decided to move in with my mom to save money while this economy sorts itself out. I‚Äôm lucky I have this option as my mom has been really thrilled to have us and bending over backward to make sure we‚Äôre happy. I‚Äôm also lucky since she and my husband get along so well. And my mom and I are very close. I spent ten years living in different cities and time zones than her and we‚Äôd talk every day and I‚Äôd visit often. We get on each others nerves and I‚Äôd get irritated by her but mostly positive.  \n\nBut. Lol. Big but obviously or I wouldn‚Äôt be posting. I‚Äôve lived with her as an adult in the past and I‚Äôd just get really irritated with her over nothing. Like I felt a little too partnered with her if that makes sense? If I was going biking she‚Äôd want to come too. Or anything I‚Äôd do she‚Äôd be up for. Which is so nice but too much for me. So lots of irritation and lots of guilt about it. \n\nNow though - I‚Äôll come home from work and find her and my husband preparing dinnner and waiting for me to eat. Or just now I finished working and they went for a walk and my husband texted me to join them. \n\nLike I said: so nice they‚Äôre getting along. But as crazy as this is going to sound I feel I‚Äôm third wheeling on them sometimes? Like I feel like they‚Äôre inviting me to their activity. And I don‚Äôt always want to be doing things with my mom but the truth is he and I do go out on our own a lot but even if we‚Äôre just home a few days in a row I get this irritated feeling. \n\nAnd then all these negative thoughts about my mom come up (she always favored my brothers in childhood, etc etc etc) and I just start acting surly and childish and petty and irritated and things spiral from there. \n\nIt‚Äôs maybe easy to say ‚Äúso move out‚Äù but I‚Äôd rather fix myself in this situation. Or fix the situation somehow else. Looking for advice!",

Maybe we can get support and comfort from others dealing with similar difficult feelings).\n\nDisclaimer - I do not believe they do it intentionally. They just are involved in own lives and I think (for whatever reason) they believe a single woman in her 30's must like being alone or want it. It's the vibe I get personally. At family get togethers I am ignored. People want to exclusively talk to my brother who just had a baby and my sister who just got married. Which I get. It makes perfect sense. And this is a lot coming from me as I am someone who doesn't like or need attention. But the blatant ignoring and pity stares at these gatherings is getting to be too much. Just mere acknowledgement of my existence is only I am hoping for. \n\nI carpooled to a HS graduation of a cousin recently with my sister and her new husband. We walked into the house together and my uncle literally greeted only them  as I trailed behind. Then at the table he and his wife went on and on about how they should take advantage of their lake house. My sister and her H both work full time out of the house. They were like 'thank you for offering but it's hard bc of xyz.' Meanwhile I am sitting there, they know I work remote, and have a dog (uncle and wife are big dog people and it's super dog friendly), and they didn't once ask me or even look at me. It was the most bizarre social event. Literally being treated like I was invisible. They did the same thing when we said goodbye. Profusely thanked my sister and her H for \"making the trip\" while I was just standing there. Uh yeah I also \"made the trip.\" I had to drive an extra two hours to my sister's to carpool with them, take and pick up my dog from the daycare another 20 mins each way, and deal with a migraine from sitting in the hot car for hours in the backseat. I remember leaving thinking, \"oh yeah since I'm single I just had absolutely nothing better to do on my free Saturday than go to this event for a cousin I haven't talked to in a decade.\" I was happy to go and wanted to but I was not OK with being treated like I did not exist for hours. They even offered my sister and her H drinks and refilled them throughout the afternoon while I was just ignored. We have one next month and I think I am going to pass. \n\nMy siblings send out paper cards for things like Christmas, baby's baptism, thank you for wedding gifts, etc. I was not sent any. I only know of these cards because my mom or dad will text me and say \"aw, did you get your X card in the mail yet from your brother/sister?\" Newp. I did not. They just assume my parents will tell me the date/time/place of an event or that I'll text them about the when/where. It's really hurtful to me. They sent out a really cute baby's first Christmas holiday card to everyone last month and I wasn't sent one. They also had a birthday brunch with my dad recently and I wasn't invited. I am just always the last to know about everything. \n\nMy \"good\" friends pretty much stopped including me in anything in 2021. They are all paired up. I have consistently noticed I get invited to a lot less things as a single. At some points with these friendships I have stopped being the first to reach out to see what would happened. Well, crickets. I am the kind of person who does not need constant contact, the opposite actually. But if I'm the only one ever reaching out over the years...yeah I get the memo. I have brought this up with some of them and nothing ever changed. I do need to work on making new friends. \n\nMy mom will make the 2 hour round trip drive to visit my sister and her husband often but not to visit me (the same distance). Bc you know it's \"just me.\" My dad even said something similar to me in passing regarding visiting me. My mom and I briefly spoke on the phone and she asked about my plans tonight, \"oh just a date.\" Her tone with me was flat and unenthused the whole conversation but after I said that all of a sudden she is excited and interested in my life \"OHHH! OHMYGODDD! WHATRUWEARING! REEEE!\" like insane. I'm not enough just being me. Plus it's annoying when people have this over the top reaction to a first coffee date from a damn app that 99.9% won't go anywhere. I used to visit her a lot but stopped bc she just didn't seem to care that I was there. The only time she really contacts me is to send me info on singles mixers or restaurants to go to to meet someone. Like you think I'm unaware that I'm single? That I'm not doing all the things to meet someone? I volunteer, go out, have hobbies, etc etc doesn't guarantee mean you'll meet someone. I freeze my eggs next month. Yes it's ungodly expensive and painful, but what hurts most is that I will be doing it all alone. I am 34, turning 35 this year and the pressure of time paralyzes me with fear and sadness sometimes. It's an emotional turmoil like nothing I have ever experienced. I cry all the time. \n\nI was thinking lately too if/when I get married and have children all these friends who I was there for won't be for me. All the bridal showers, bach parties, wedding gifts, baby showers, gifts for everything, all the time I took off work, hotels, etc. A lot of celebrating them and their milestones. All the expense, time and energy I have happily given over the years. I never did it to get anything back. But yeah it makes me sad. I'm just a single woman. Nothing to celebrate here ever.

Why does he need to notify his mother? \n\nHis siblings hardly ever discuss their daily lives with their mother and only do so when specifically requested. \n\nHe constantly thinks I'm a kid, but I never tell my relatives or parents anything.

He lives 20 minutes by car from where I live which for me is not that far but I have to take 2 buses to reach his place and it takes around 45 mins. Plus it is very cold these days.\n\nI dated a guy before who lived much further away and he would always insist on picking me up and dropping me home. Even when I insisted on taking the bus because I did like him always driving so far just to pick me up, he would always look for an excuse to come. He would say stuff like he could never let me come by bus in such a weather or he he does not want me to do such a long trip by bus. We had to break up because our goals were not aligned but I think he set the bar quite high.\n\nWhen the other guy did not suggest to come pick me up, I felt really disappointed and feel he might not be that into me. But wanted to hear from the experience of others. Am I being unreasonable or too demanding?",

My bf is great, brings so much to the table, and after nearly two decades of dating, I know this in my gut. I am also somewhat in mourning for my singleness and freedom, although the benefits of the relationship are manifold (not to mention we want to have biological children). We do have lifestyle differences. As an example, I already have a lot of friends, but he has many more and has a much higher capacity for socializing, and I've picked fights over feeling like his time is zero sum and not enough is spent just on us privately. My bf has asked me to trust that he will dial it down over time and adjust. There is a part of me that has difficulty being fully accepting of another person's needs and differences and a bit \"triggered\" by worries that I will let myself be walked over as I was in previous relationships. \n\nAny other ladies (especially those who got together with their partners past 35) struggle with determining what is compromise and acceptance, and what is just knuckling under?

        "text": "So everyday, for a decade now, I've stuck to what works for me in a professional manufacturing career: heeled booties, long and dark (not faded, ripped or bedazzled) bootcut jeans, a plain blouse and a light weight blazer. Nothing too cheap but nothing expensive since I'm around welding and machining but also meetings and customers. Earrings and rings ok, but no long necklaces. I wear makeup and wear my hair down but straightened or lightly curled. Every day. \n\nAnd I just turned 39 and realized that I don't want to end up like my dear old aunt. She has had the same haircut and perm for... 45 years? And when she thins out her closet, she's only getting rid of clothes she's had for... 20 years? She's overly committed.\n\nI've just bought some straighter, skinnier (but not painted on skin tight, jeans or jeggings), still dark though. And I've bought flatter, more Chelsea style booties instead of my 3\" wedges I've been wearing forever. But I just feel so.... Disproportionate? Casual? Top heavy? I don't know exactly. It's so different. But I know it's time to change it up. I need the courage to wear this out of the house!\n\nI don't know how I can admire this on everyone else and on all shapes and sizes and it's so in style, right? What am I missing? What else could I try? I'm so frustrated!!\n\nThoughts? Experience? Suggestions?\nTIA üíã",

        "text": "I have a 3 year old not super well behaved cavapoo that I got with my ex. I love him, but it‚Äôs been hard to have him since we broke up. I live in an apt building and he barks all the time - elevator, people on the hallway, etc. Tried hiring a trainer, collars, etc - still barks. We‚Äôre coming back to 3 days a week in the office, and I can technically bring my dog, but he behaves terribly (barking at everyone) so I put him in daycare instead. It‚Äôs $30/day. It adds up.\n\nI‚Äôve been sharing the dog with my ex since we separated, but he‚Äôs with me most of the time. His idea of taking care of the dog is giving him to his parents. He doesn‚Äôt even walk him. But even with all this, it‚Äôs nice to have an alt parent for when I travel.\n\nWe‚Äôre finally getting the divorce paperwork ready and need to decide. My ex says ‚Äúhe‚Äôll do whatever I want‚Äù (way to avoid the blame). For context, he‚Äôs been super uncommunicative and I don‚Äôt really trust him. When the dog is with him, I don‚Äôt even get the pictures. I always send him pics and stories.\n\nMy instinct is to say I keep the dog, but he‚Äôs very poorly behaved, and it‚Äôs extremely expensive. I love him though. Giving him up feels like bailing on responsibility and subjecting my dog to dying from obesity because his ‚Äúgrandparents‚Äù will over feed him (giving the dog to my ex means giving him to his parents).\n\nI‚Äôm also considering moving. Perhaps to another state, where I can adopts a house with a yard. It‚Äôs not entirely motivated by the dog, but he‚Äôs a big part of it. It‚Äôs hard though.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I (36F) have been dating my boyfriend (37M) for almost a year. Early on it was made clear that we are both looking for someone for the long haul, to marry someday and have children. Things with us are going great - we travel a bunch, have similar interests that we share, can talk things out very well, and are both committed to making our relationship work. I love him and see a future with him. My question is, how do you bring up possible/ideal time lines for things like marriage and children? \n\nAs mentioned, I'm 36. He will be 38 soon. We are not getting any younger. He is in the process of renovating part of his house and I realize right at this moment is probably not the best time to be bringing up when he sees himself having kids. But lately it's all I can think about. I want to be a mom so badly. \n\nI'm never afraid to say anything to him - we are very blunt and open with each other. I'll say things like \"so and so is a cute baby name\" or when we are having a deep discussion telling him I fear that I've missed my chance. But he has never said \"I want to have kids next year or the year after\" and I suppose that's what I yearn to hear. I would like to know if he thinks about time lines, an approximate time to marry, and have a child.\n\nI'm really afraid I'm running out of time and I don't want to put that fear on his shoulders which is why I am creating this post. Do you have any tips for how to ask these questions? It's not that I'm afraid I'm going to freak him out or to bring this all up, I'm just concerned that I will come across like I'm pushing for something we're not ready for. Deep down I'm petrified that we will just take each day as it comes without any sort of strategy and then years will go by and I'll be 40 and childless. (not saying that is a bad position to be in - I embrace people who choose to be childfree - but for me personally I want to have at least two kids).\n\nThanks so much for reading and for any tip, stories, or insight you may have to share.",

        "text": "my sister moved with me after bouncing between different family and friend's houses for about 2 years after breaking up with her long term boyfriend. she is studying psychology and has at least 2 years more for her degree. she is working as a waitress in the mean time. also she is also partially blind.\n\nall that to give you a quick snapshot about where she is in life atm. \n\nin my view she isnt all that complicated of a situation, she only has to grind a couple more years and then she can get a real job she likes and start her life. i dont mean to dismiss her hardships, i just see that her path forward is relatively clear. \n\nthe problem is that to her everything that happens is an insurmountable obstacle and gets into these self pity parties that are incredibly draining to everyone. before anyone asks, yes she is going to therapy. i dont know if it helps her since i try not to pry on her business.   \n\nfor example, the other day she wanted to put on a shelf, but she made the holes a little too big and the screws wouldnt hold it. to most people that would be a minor annoyance, you would just make new holes and move on with your life. but to her it is undeniable proof that she cant do anything right and that she is a failure etc etc. that it isnt a big deal at all i learned long ago that trying to fix her problems for herself is the worst thing i can do, at best i suggest a path forward from my point of view if i think she is too stuck. but i dont even know if that helps\n\n\ni guess what im asking is for the perspective of other women about this situation. should i stay away more?",

There are a few people I guess but I have no energy to make that connection happen right now.

        "text": "I hope this is acceptable here - you ladies always have great advice and I'm totally out of my comfort zone.\n\nI‚Äôd love some input or advice on bonus structure negotiations with my firm. For background, I‚Äôve worked at this firm for 7 years (in the field for 20 years) and always have glowing performance reviews. After successfully pitching a modest salary increase of 8% for cost-of-living, I requested a bonus structure be added during my performance review last week. Options A and B were my original emailed bonus pitch. After my email, one of the partners (with whom I work almost exclusively and I have a great relationship, I‚Äôll call ‚ÄúBob‚Äù) called me with the third bonus suggestion. Bob said he‚Äôd call the other partner (‚ÄúJoe‚Äù) and voice his support. I sent a follow-up email with option C.\n\n**A. Nondiscretionary bonus as 10% of my billable fees.**While this does not distinguish between billable and non-billable hours, it weighs my tenure at FIRM and the number of administrative duties I perform. Excluding base pay, estimated fringe benefits and proposed bonus, roughly 50% of my billable fees stay with FIRM. Bonus: $21k\n\n**B. Nondiscretionary bonus as 7% of my billable fees, plus discretionary bonus as 10% of base salary.**Over 50% of my billable fees stay with FIRM, after base, fringe benefits and bonus, but the included discretionary bonus allows for recognition of non-billable duties. Bonus: $15k nondiscretionary, plus up to $8.5k discretionary\n\n**C. Nondiscretionary bonus as 5% of all GROUP billable fees.**This would reflect not just my own billing, but my leadership responsibilities as well: working with the GROUP to capture all billable hours and build efficient billing practices will increase fees. It‚Äôs a more collaborative approach but beneficial to both FIRM and myself, especially as the GROUP becomes more proficient. Bonus: $18k\n\nAdditional info: in my 3-person group, I billed \\~900 hours, person B billed \\~450 hours, person C billed \\~250 hours for 2022. The percentages included above are flexible, this was just my first pitch.\n\nI met with Joe yesterday on a separate topic, but he told me he‚Äôs still reviewing my proposal. He then explained he‚Äôd polled firms for salary ranges and thought he‚Äôd give me $90k salary and I‚Äôd ‚Äúbe very happy with it‚Äù. $90k is more than my salary request because I want a bonus going forward. He also told me my bonus structure was ‚Äúa little rich‚Äù and seemed skeptical that billable hours could increase. From experience, I expect persons B and C to bill double those figures, but they don‚Äôt have billing experience which is where I come in. We ended the meeting with him saying he wanted all parties to be happy with the arrangement, and he‚Äôd continue to consider the structure. The partners have expressed support for a bonus structure, so it‚Äôs not dead in the water.\n\nWhat‚Äôs my next move? I want to keep these talks moving but I have never in my life negotiated my salary or bonus structure. Every time I‚Äôve pitched a salary increase, it‚Äôs been immediately accepted (making me think I undervalue my salary). I‚Äôm totally out of my element here, while the partners are firmly in theirs. Your input is so very appreciated!!!!",

This problem has become so debilitating that I truly need some advice or tips on how to escape it.\n\nI struggle with being a wallflower in nearly all professional settings that involve clients. For example, I was at a business lunch yesterday with my boss and one of our clients. The boss does a great job of (i) keeping the conversation going, (ii) actively listening, and (iii) sprinkling in little bits of industry knowledge or world news when relevant. I, on the other hand, sat there silently eating my quinoa bowl. \n\nThis problem translates into business meetings as well, and I find it a struggle to lead business meetings and teams calls with clients and struggle with being \"reactive\" to what clients are telling me. I always prepare for all of my business meetings, but when things off script, I freeze and its usually my boss that swoops in to save me. This is an issue leading to a ton of anxiety for me at work and a lot of embarrassment. Can anyone else relate?",
