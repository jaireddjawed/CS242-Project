Out of all the areas above, which do y'all (as scientists) feel like there's the biggest opportunities for new software to make a big difference?\n2. Are there any existing organizations/initiatives/companies doing work in these areas that you think are worth looking at?\n\nI know this is pretty broad, but I'm just getting going on this journey and am hoping for some general pointers to get going.\n\nThanks!",

Now imagine an average colonist on Mars. The amount of workout for them would be less, but it would be constantly required, hence no civilian personnel can be trusted in sticking to it. \n\nSo the discussion is:\n\nShould martian gravity be considered an issue, possibly marking Mars as uncolonizable? Or making it forever a military/science colony? \n\nAre there any solution to this? (except for magnets on the shoes of course) \n\nJust out of curiosity, do you know any literature or other sources where this was addressed? ",

My version of the PDF was corrupted and a lot of the words were misspelled so I assumed what they were with the context. From my understanding, what their study concludes is that using speculative and observational evidence, is that we are alone in the universe.\n\nMy problem are the speculative parts. How can they exactly be sure of the claims they are making for certain variables of the Drake equation? We are observing the universe as it occurred millions and billions of years ago in outer space. I think  that some parts of the study, like the ruling out of Kardashev III type civilizations in the Milky Way are reasonable in terms of the distance from the farthest points of the galaxy relative to Earth that their light isn't a projection of billions of years into the past.\n\nHowever, the study makes further claims that for the entire observable universe, there are no Kardashev III civilizations based on the observational evidence and I think that is suspect. If we are talking about observing a galaxy at the edge of the observable universe, it's light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth. These galaxies are in their infancy from the perspective of Earth, how is it reasonable to assume that it is the case that there aren't Kardashev III civilizations in these galaxies but it would be impossible for the light to reach us and know?\n\nThe study makes a bunch of other assumptions and sort of 'averages' out the totality of the literature on the Fermi paradox but I feel as if this is circular logic. How can we be looking for extra terrestrial life with human criteria of what we would assume to find on Earth?\n\nFor example, the study mentions that abiogenesis on Earth was primarily dominated by RNA and the study seems to say that abiogenesis itself was extremely rare or even improbable, but we only have a sample size of 1, Earth itself.\n\nAm I misinterpreting the study? I skipped most of the graphs, statistics because I just couldn't understand it along with the corruption of my PDF file.",

        "text": "As part of our intelligence, we observe what is around us and make life choices based off this. A longtime ago, we decided to live our lives differently then any other animal on the planet. We chose to take responsibility for feeding ourselves away from nature, because we not only protect our food source, as many animals are known to do (that would be natural), we actively seek out possible competitors for our food and eliminate them when not a direct threat to us to ensure our food source is there when we want it. We kill animals that eat our food, knock down forests with thousands of varieties of plants so we can plant a single crop in its place repeatedly until all nutrients are gone the land becomes useless and gas out millions of insects because they damage our crops. This has caused us to live outside of what nature can provide, but also allowed us to have more people in a given geographic area then would otherwise be sustainable, which has lead us to our current societies. Given we are the only species on the planet to do this, it seems like the natural order is more in line with what the animals do, live in nature and do your best competing with everything else. So wouldn't it be reasonable to assume at least some if not most alien life would also live within nature and do it's best to compete for what is naturally available instead of trying to control the whole world around them?\n\nAs I read about the Fermi Paradox, and the recent articles claiming that we are alone in the universe, it seems that these rely on other intelligent life also causing pollution or having accomplished space flight for us to notice they are even there. They even broke it down into 4 scenarios where climate change is a forgone conclusion of intelligent life and a species' survival would be based on how they reacted to it (do they recognize it is their fault and change in time to avert disaster). \n\nNow it seems a bit narcissistic to say that this is the only possible option for intelligent life to have taken just because it is the one we have taken.\n\nSo imagine if you will, another planet that had a similar growth pattern as ours, where they never decided to become aggressive agriculturalists but kept living in smaller communities that could rely on nature for its needs. Such a planet would never show up in our search as being inhabited, even though it is crawling with life, because there is no pollution and they woukd most likely not be able to accomplish things like space flight which would require a level of cooperation and asset centralization that would simply not exist there. \n\nOr better yet, a planet with no dominant species, but just covered with animals like our planet was for millennia, this would also be an example of intelligent life that would never be seen using current detection models.\n\nI understand the technical hurdles involved with being able to find and categorize planets in other solar systems, so I get why there is no proof either way yet, so while I am open to the possiblity there being no life outside our planet, I do find it highly unlikely that we are alone. And I think it is a little presumptuous for people who claim to be scientists to definitively say we are alone when all we have really done is peak out the curtains so to speak.\n",

And since its not as useful as it was then, the little toe may disappear.\n* Modern lifestyle causes radical changes than impacts our anatomy, and that living a sedentary lifestyle with less physical activity would lead to the loss of muscles and as such, more people would look endomorphic and skinny in the future.\n\nNow that does give some surprising standpoint from a \"lamarkism\" side of things on how some muscles would be gone and the such.

I hope this is OK.   \nPlease note, a TL;DR is available at bottom.  \n\n\nHey,  \n\n\nI  have such interests, ideas, and questions as to speak to the stuff of  existence, to the fabric of this place, this thing that we call the  Cosmos (or that I, having Carl Sagan as my absolute favourite human  &lt;3, do call it).\n\nI also love the late  Isaac Asimov, and I have this beautiful three-volume work that purports  (and I'd be inclined to believe Mr. Asimov, personally) to cover motion,  sound and heat, light, magnetism and electricity, and electron, proton  and neutron.\n\nThis particular copy seems to have been produced in 1993. [Here is a copy of the work. ](https://www.amazon.ca/Understanding-Physics-3-Volumes-1/dp/0880292512)\n\nI  could see there being a good deal of supplementary reading, afterward,  regarding the third volume. And this is to say nothing of the lack of  good, modern science of quantum mechanics, quantum fields, and the like.\n\nThinking  well of Asimov's penchant for clear writing, I feel as though this book  could be beneficial, toward such an end as I might flush out what  strange understandings my ignorance harbours, to plug up assumptions and  blind spots with new, coherent reasons for understanding. That's a  strange way to end that sentence.\n\nSuffice to say, might I be using my time well, reading this work?\n\nI  read a short book on scientific achievements, earlier in the summer,  and it held a couple of beliefs which I identified as being wrong as  heck. haha. To the credit of the work, it was also before the space  race, and I believe the position was mostly doubtful that we'd ever make  it to the other stars. For what it was, a book from the 40s or so, it  was pretty good. Very weak ending, though. I almost wondered why the  author thought to write it at all.\n\nYou see, it's these wild digressions of thought; were it not for these, perhaps I'd already know some maths.\n\nTL;DR  -- Ought I, a layperson, interested in knowing more about the nature of  matter, energy, and time (more than I presently know, and more quality  understandings, or, at least an increased capacity to ask more useful  questions), while not wanting to waste my time, if reading so dated a  work, however well explained, constitutes a waste of my time, read  [this book, Understanding Physics by Isaac Asimov](https://www.amazon.ca/Understanding-Physics-3-Volumes-1/dp/0880292512) ?\n\nAnyway, thanks, and I hope this is an appropriate question for the sub.\n\nGosh, I wish I knew maths (and that, perhaps, I wrote in a more concise fashion).\n\nThanks,\n\n\\- Haight",

But was caloric theory more defensible? Did any thermodynamic observation stand to support caloric and not frigoric? Especially any observation available to them at that time?",

Atmospheric nitrogen has gone mostly unaffected. By morning a deep red Aurora has spread all across the planet; excited nitrogen is twisting and weaving across the planet's electromagnetic web. Mass panic is erupting, and people have begun suffocating in open air in metro areas and large cities. Rural areas and places with large amounts of vegetation and those close to the oceans are experiencing less severe symptoms, buts its still clear that the world is suffering and slowly dying of oxygen deprivation.\n\nI've come to you all today seeking possible explanations for what could happen to the oxygen( big vacuum, hydrosynthesis, artificial semi-contained, or targeted, black hole...those are my best guesses rn lol) and also what other affects might be occurring: heat waves, ice age, spontaneous combustion, build up of toxic gasses, storms, floods, etc.\n\nThanks for reading and lending me your thoughts :).",

The act of milking results in more hormone being released, keeping milk production going.\n\n[Disclaimer: This is how I think it works, I haven't googled it yet. If it turns out to work completely different, I will edit!]\n\nSince the biochemical industry can produce certain hormones from cell cultures instead of direct \"harvest\" from animals, can the milk-production-triggering hormone be produced in a lab/factory? If so, why is this technique not used to start the milk production in cows or why is it better to systematic fertilize cows?\n\nI'm a chemist, but not a biochemist. So my background involves some basic biochemistry and cell-/microbiology, but not enough to say wether or not it is as simple as to administer a hormone or that there are a lot more factors into play here.
