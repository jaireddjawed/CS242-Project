        "author": "Rainbow_Stains",
        "url": "https://youtu.be/28trJ24MGF8",
        "text": "So on May 3rd, 2022, I (M24, 23 when it happened) suffered a stroke due to the artery in the left side of my neck dissecting, trying to heal by clotting, and some of those clots dislodged and traveled to my brain. \nEither through several intubations, or a direct consequence of the stoke, my left vocal chord was paralyzed, among other disabilities and consequence. For several months, i could barely speak and could not eat or drink anything and quickly was implated with a feeding tube. In October 2022, i underwent a procedure where an ENT injected my paralyzed left vocal chord with botox to inflate it and move it over the gap your vocal chords are supposed to cover that leads to your windpipe, so that my right chord could close and cover the opening, and vibrate againt it giving me some sort of voice back. \nIn December, i had made enough progress in therapy and as a result of the procedure that i was able to have the feeding tube removed and have been able (with difficulty) to eat and drink again.\nMy question comes from the fact that my voice sound nothing like it used to due to all of this. Its squeaky, raspy, and weak, to the point it tires out easily if i speak too much or eat too much without resting it. Again, there's only 1 vocal chord doing all the work basically. \nHowever, i have a decent amount of recordings and videos of what my voice used to sound like. I am wondering, is it possible to create a TTS AI program or something that can hopefully recreate my voice as it once was, in a similar way that the videos of fake politicians and celebrities TTS and being made and curculating. I dont have a whole lot of material to work with like politicians or celebrities who are constantly recorded, but i have some old tiktoks, videos, etc. and was wondering if someone out there could help.\nThank you",
