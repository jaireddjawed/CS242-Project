        "text": "I picked up Axiom’s End by Lindsey Ellis a few weeks ago and I’ve been reading it during downtime at work. I’m not finished but my favorite thing about it so far is the sense of grounded realism it has. \n\nThe main character Cora gets kidnapped by an alien refugee and forced to take them cross-country in the first part of the book. She struggles with finding food, clothes, and shelter while transporting this alien, who is partially cybernetic and doesn’t understand her needs at all. Cora having these very human and relatable struggles really grounds the story in reality which meshes well with the fantastic sci-fi elements. \n\nAnd the book has a strong sense of place and time too. It’s in Bush Era, which is emphasized by the pop culture references the characters make, the music they listen to, and the media they watch. I always think it’s fun to see a “period piece” set in the recent past because it reminds you that previous decades, even recent ones, still had their own distinct culture and personality. \n\nI also like how even though I haven’t met the character of Nils, Cora’s dad, at the point where I am in the book yet, he’s still very present and well characterized through the snippets of his interviews and blog posts that appear in between chapters. It feels like a modern day epistolary novel. \n\nAnyway, when I finish, I think I am definitely on board for the sequel.",

And you can feel the nostalgia for the time and place that you've never been a part of, but are longing to be.\n\nI didn't quite like Hem's writing style in \"The old man and the sea\", it felt too try for me. But this one was a very emotional journey. Quotes will convey it much better than I ever could:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* About Francis Scott Fitzgerald. Esp. in the context of tragic relationship Scott was in and how negatively it was affecting his writing, this almost brought me to tears:\n   * *\"His talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust of a butterfly’s wings. At one time he understood it no more than the butterfly did and he did not know when it was brushed or marred. Later he became conscious of his damaged wings and of their construction and he learned to think and could not fly any more because the love of flight was gone and he could only remember when it had been effortless.\"*\n* About Gertrude Stein. It's so funny when you look at her photos:\n   * *She got to look like a Roman empreror and that was fine if you liked your women to look like Roman emprerors.*\n* About Paris:\n   * *But Paris was a very old city and we were young and nothing was simple there, not even poverty, nor sudden money, nor the moonlight, nor right and wrong nor the breathing of someone who lay beside you in the moonlight.*\n   * *If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.*\n   * *There is never any ending to Paris and the memory of each person who has lived in it differs from that of any other. We always returned to it no matter who we were or how it was changed or with what difficulties, or ease, it could be reached. Paris was always worth it and you received return for whatever you brought to it. But this is how Paris was in the early days when we were very poor and very happy.*",

It all felt too distant.\n\nIt is understandable if the characters aren't likable, perhaps that is the goal, but it all felt like a sad, boring tale where you don't really have anyone to root for and no real interest in the story too. I felt I was reading it because it was an important book and at no point did I feel it had gripped me.\n\nThe prose being very formal and to the point didn't help in warming up to the book. The only bit of heart I could find in the book came from Gatsby himself but even he is a weird kind of person whose state of mind and thinking can be hard to relate/understand.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on The Great Gatsby?",

The publisher was Belmont Books.   \nTHEN Tower Publishers merged with Belmont.  Tower books took the title and renamed it \"Unknown Mysteries of the Past\" in roughly 1970. And Tower went out of business in 2012.    \nThe author died in 1974.  His daughter died in a freak car accident two years prior, and his wife went nuts (and likely died).  No kin whatsoever can be found.  If you can find one, be my guest.   \n\n\nThe Book as of this date is called \"Ancient aliens and unknown mysteries of the Past\" and there is NO COPYRIGHT INFO whatsoever online, or even on the book itself.  I've looked all through the copyright database after 1970 and found NOTHING.   \n\n\nSo, public domain work? Or who knows something that I don't about this?....",

After they die, he returns to his home and curses the town and/or the ones who killed them.\n\nTW again if you missed it, the excerpts I remember are..violent. Probably why they stuck in my mind for so many years.\n\nI remember the following excerpts:\n\"Then the screams rose higher than the flames.\"\nThe daughter asking her mother if being burned alive will hurt.\nA woman tried to stab her sister (?) and fell on her own knife \"the blood bubbled over her lips\"\n\nI also have thus vague memory that the father disguised himself as another man and eventually revealed himself jn a scary way to someone (i.e. face melting off or something).",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11q0azr/the_naked_lunch_1964_by_william_burroughs/",
        "text": "I had always considered this as one of \"the great classics\" of the 60's alternative culture.  Certainly the blurb rates itself very highly:\n\n&gt; \"I think that William Burroughs is the only living American novelist who may conceivably be possessed by genius.\" -- Norman Mailer\n\nI picked up a second hand copy for a dollar or two, and I finally got around to reading it.  Honestly, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to have gotten from it.  Supposedly it is an insight into the mind of drug addiction.  Certainly it is a spiraling surreal, hallucinogenic journey through... I'm not sure what.\n\nThe work begins in the first person, and we follow Burroughs himself through various \"highs and lows\", as he indirectly and fancifully describes his druggie friends and his dealers.  But the story quickly leaps further into the extreme, and a mix of wild and only loosely related scenes follow.  The narrative jumps between places, persons, and tones.  Burroughs himself is left far behind through the middle section, as stream-of-consciousness scenes are played out.  Nearly all involve drugs, death, and a great deal of sex... mostly homosexual, mostly violent, sometimes fatal.\n\nIt wasn't an easy read at all.  The only things that kept me going are the \"I've started so I'll finish!\" and the \"It's a world-famous classic, there must be a purpose to it all!\"  But it was a grind, I can assure you.  And at the end, I really don't feel as though I've learned anything authentic or reliable about drug addiction.  Nor have I gained any new perspective on society.  Or on sexual politics.  Nor... anything really.\n\nThe weird thing is, Burroughs is actually a fantastic writer.  His prose is evocative, rich, clever, and frequently hilarious.  He is clearly a smart and worldly-wise man.  Individually speaking, many of the chapters would have been superb as short stories in a 1960's Playboy magazine, or an 1960's or 1970's sci-fi anthology magazine like \"Galaxy\".\n\nBut the whole is much less than the sum of its parts.  Nothing actually goes anywhere.  There is no character development.  No plot.  No lesson to be learned.  No arc.  The most offensive chapters are overly-long.  The most interesting chapters are too short -- they work up a theme, present an idea, then end prematurely.\n\nThe final result is little more than a test of the reader's stamina.\n\nI do understand that in the 60's, creative writers were looking for \"new forms of story-telling\".  And with your eyes squinted, this certainly does look \"new\".  But it's not really \"story-telling\", so it kind of fails at the first hurdle in terms of what a novel needs to do.  If you're not educating and not entertaining, then... really, what are you offering?\n\nNo, I cannot recommend this book at all.  In the flush of the psychedelic generation this might have looked like a diamond in the rough.  But history and hindsight must disagree.",

I have no idea what being \"third of elements\" or \"second of grammar\" means beyond some sort of k-12 grade. \n\nWhen Stephen goes to Belvedere, he's in \"number two\" in his second year, and references how Heron and he were the only smart ones in \"number one\" I think. From what I gather this is something like he's in second year at the equivalent of high school, now, and he and Heron stood out while in the first year, but combined with all the earlier stuff in his first stint at school I'm not so sure now. Are these grades? Is it like class A-B-C in modern schools, same year but different subgroups? Sometimes it seems like it's referring to class rank, like when he got cards (?) for second as leader of the Yorkists (which I gather was like team A and team B in the same class for small competition).\n\nDoes anyone have some insight into this?",

I still remember the first summer I read it I couldn't get through it at all because it didn't make any logical sense, and then suddenly it hit me that it wasn't supposed to be logical, it was supposed to intuitively speak to me.

The supernatural elements are optional, I don’t need those (but they’re fun!), but I’d really like a story that makes me want to live in its world like this one does, and that is grounded in good complex characters like this one, dealing with heavy stuff but not feeling hopeless or too excessively dark.
