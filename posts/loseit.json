Between 2019-2020, i lost ~45lbs solely through CICO. Since 2020, I\u2019ve been pretty much maintaining this loss, fluctuating between 130-140. My lowest weight I believe was ~128 at some point. \n\nSince the new year, I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m finally ready to truly get back on the losing bandwagon. I started 2023 at 138.5 after a very stressful transition and holiday season. \n\nBut, losing weight at 5\u20190 is not fun, especially after already losing a significant amount of weight. I\u2019ve been in a deficit, consuming ~1200 cals and hitting around 80-100g of protein a day. Since starting this deficit, I\u2019ve also started going to the gym consistently and I walk leisurely when it\u2019s nice. Even with this, the weight has been crawling off. Between Jan 1 and Feb 28, I lost 3 lbs. 3 lbs in 2 months. Demoralizing at best. But understandable, because 1200 isn\u2019t a massive deficit since I am a relatively ~smol~ person. \n\nOn a whim, i decided to purchase a walking pad and a standing desk, since I WFH and spent a ton of time sedentary. It arrived on Thursday, March 2nd, and I immediately started using it. I now average 18,049 steps a day (according to my Apple Watch) versus 1-3,000 previously (yoinks). This is about 8-10 miles, walking for about 2-3 hours a day. I walk during meetings, while doing mindless work tasks, etc. \n\nI feel better, I sleep better, and I look better being physically active. My weight is on a more consistent downward trend than before. I am now down almost 6 lbs since Jan 1 (a good amount for someone my size!). I have a PCP appointment coming up in the next month or so and Im excited to get a full blood panel to compare to last year when I was completely sedentary. \n\nI know weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise. But don\u2019t underestimate the impact low intensity exercise can have on weight loss. I really believe this was the missing puzzle for me. And I\u2019m so excited to stay consistent and see the true progress I can make while being in a larger deficit all because of walking! \n\nHighly recommend for all you WFH folks if you can afford to do so.\n\nLink to the walking pad, as requested by many: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0BGGNKGCK?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details.

I've gained roughly 8 pounds since that time so about 2.6lbs per month. Only been seriously lifting for just over a year.\n\nStupidly I've lost my measurements from the beginning of 2022, but I made the decision to do a 12 week cut in January 2022 to March 2022, and got down to what I'd estimate was about 15% body fat. I can't really tell what body fat percentage I'm at now, but I've gained some in the last three months.\n\nIn three months, my measurements have gone up quite considerably. My arms have gone up from 14 to nearly 15, and having measured every body part, I seem to have gained about an inch everywhere.  \nMy hips and waist have gone up as well -- I've put just over half an inch on my hips (love handle area) even though I do still have visible abs, so I guess I've gone up a few percent.\n\nHaving assessed, I think I've gained slightly more than I should have considering I wanted to do a lean bulk. From everything I've read, 1% of weight gain is recommended for minimal fat gain.\n\nI want to continue gaining but I would like to drop back a couple of body fat percentages, so I was considering doing a mini cut and then jump back into gaining.\n\nI'm quite worried about doing it, though. I was watching a video the other day by Natural Hypertrophy where he was discussing bulking, and he said that people can end up gaining too much and getting fat but with the illusion that they're getting more muscular because they're getting stronger.\n\nI'd always assumed strength correlated with muscle gain, but I'm worried now I'll cut and find out that I barely gained any muscle. I've been progressing in reps and weight virtually every workout on my lifts, but how will I know whether it's due to muscle gain or just overall weight gain?\n\nI mean, I *presume* I've gained a fair bit of muscle. My arms going up nearly an inch must be some muscle gain as they look lean and I don't imagine have gained a lot of fat. But then there's other stuff like water weight to consider.\n\nI'd ideally like to do a mini cut for about six weeks, but I do feel I'm playing with fire a bit. I've worked really hard for the eight pounds I've gained over the last three months, and I don't want to find that at the end of the cut, I'm somehow pretty much back where I started.\n\nI could just carry on bulking but with an altered, slower surplus approach where I'm gaining under 2lbs a month, but I feel If I gain any more fat than I have now I'm not really going to like it.\n\nAny advice?

I managed to catch ailments like pok\u00e9mon: COVID, bronchitis, concussion, broken nose. I was miserable, depressed and slowly turning into a Jigglypuff. I turned to emotional eating as an escape.

I felt amazing and couldn\u2019t believe I actually did it and I was actually happy with my body.\n\nNow I\u2019m around 140-145lbs (still great, I know). But I still don\u2019t feel happy.

But it\u2019s also for anyone who can relate to or take anything from my journey. Warnings for content around disordered eating below.\n\nI got out of a really toxic relationship in September 2018 where I estimate my peak weight was 430lbs. From September 2018 to May 2020 I lost 270lbs with my lowest weight around 155-160lbs. Wow that\u2019s a lot and really fast you might say - yup hence the title of what I\u2019d do differently.\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/arOK7HF\n\nIn there:\n\n* Before\/after of my highest weight to now\n \n* My lowest weight\n\n* Body pics at 230ish and now\n\nMy brain works better in bullets so here we go\n\n**How I Did It:**\n\n* I should note that most of my life I\u2019ve not lived in a heavier body which probably contributes to why I was able to lose the weight fast - my body just wasn\u2019t used to having that weight on. I gained all that weight over a period of 6-7 years prior to 2018\n\n* I wanted to lose the weight so badly, so quickly that I was willing to do whatever. Early on I was losing about a pound a day just by reducing my food intake to relatively whole foods which was relatively fine at first. I pretty much ate protein and vegetables with some grains and was able to make it by.\n\n* After about 100lbs it started to become harder and I really reduced my food intake. At one point I actively started pushing to eat 1,500 calories and then later 1,200 calories. This was a bad idea (see next section)\n\n* I picked up rock climbing at about 230lbs in addition to doing cardio. I\u2019m still climbing and it\u2019s become a true passion in my life but realistically I don\u2019t think it did anything for my weight loss. Eventually I got obsessive about doing 30 minutes to an hour of cardio a day and added in weight lifting\n\n* I kept pushing my food intake lower and lower while obsessively tracking calories and daily steps\/activity. None of this was sustainable or healthy if you haven\u2019t gotten this by now\n\n* The lowest I got was 155 with about 12% body fat, I felt literally awful all the time, was just skin and bones. March of last year I got into therapy to help with the disordered eating and body image issues I developed. Since then I\u2019ve gotten into therapy, gained about 20lbs - a mix of muscle and needed fat, and don\u2019t feel terrible all the time anymore\n\n**Physical and Mental Things I Experienced**\n\nI wanted to write this section for anyone who might benefit from reading any of this to know there are others have experienced similar things. But also to show the ugly side of doing what I did.\n\n* During my peak restriction I started to feel dizzy, have hair loss, feel tired literally all the time. I can remember not being able to get up off the couch without feeling like I was going to fall over.\n\n* As I got more interested in fitness - between cardio and lifting - I can distinctly remember walking away from sessions feeling physically ill because I was underserving my body the fuel it needed during high intensity sessions. It\u2019s a garbage feeling to almost fall over with dizziness after a deadlift\n\n* On the mental side I developed a fucked up relationship with food. I was severely restricting, had binge\/purge cycles, and built up poor frameworks about nutrition. I personally don\u2019t believe anything is as easy as CICO or any fad diet anymore. Nutrition is tough and is not one size fits all, no matter how much marketing would have you believe\n\n* I started to see food as the enemy and feeling ashamed for being full and guilty if I ate too much. I still haven\u2019t gotten over these but am working through it\n\n* Body image is tricky. When I started losing weight I imagined I\u2019d have this perfect body at the end and I\u2019d feel so great about everything. Welp that\u2019s not the case. I have a ton of extra skin (don\u2019t let this scare you into not losing weight though). I kept pushing so hard to lose fat because I thought it would help mitigate my saggy chest showing through shirts - it really didn\u2019t\n\n* Part of my therapy the last year has been coming to accept my body and everything I\u2019ve gone through even if it still makes me uncomfortable. Fortunately I\u2019ve been able to save up enough to get surgery done in May on my chest, stomach and lower back but I know going into it that I still won\u2019t be Brad Pitt at the end of it (but imagine if I was?)\n\n\n**What I\u2019d Do Differently:**\n\n* Seek out professional help. I tried to do everything myself because of my personality and a fear of sharing all my insecurities around this process. Since losing most of my weight I\u2019ve talked to doctors, therapists, nutritionists who have nuanced, valuable insights than some bullshit article written for SEO clicks\n* Listened to my friends less. My friends were amazing for motivation and nothing but supportive, but their commentary wormed its way into my head. It\u2019s not their fault at all, but all the encouragement pushed me to do even more. And as much as my friends think they \u201ceat healthy\u201d they don\u2019t know shit about nutrition either\n* Go sooo much slower. I just wanted to be done as quickly as possible and fortunately for me it worked out without any negative physical long term side effects but I\u2019d have set myself up for success so much better if i had done it over a time period twice as long as I did\n* Do more resistance training. I got to a super low weight but lost so much muscle. I was trying to climb but was super weak. There\u2019s some promising research on the overall health benefits of resistance training and I wish I had consistently done it throughout my journey\n* Been nicer to myself. I\u2019m a bit of a perfectionist and I still struggle with this daily. Therapy has helped me identify a lot of negative self-talk and I pushed myself really hard. People used to ask me how I was losing that much weight and I\u2019d say \u201cyou just have to hate yourself enough\u201d - big oof looking back on it\n\ntl;dr: My weight loss (and overall life) journey was one of pushing myself too hard to be perfect and realizing afterwards there is no perfect. Life is hard, and weight loss in itself didn\u2019t make me fulfilled no matter how much I worked to achieve my goals. If I had to give any advice to anyone I\u2019d say to be smart about things, try to utilize any many reliable or professional resources as you are able to, and be kind to yourself no matter what\u2019s happening on your path","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678545313.0},{"title":"I\u2019m 14 and this is my plan to lose some weight","author":"sgkskgsgkakgs","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11q4xwy\/im_14_and_this_is_my_plan_to_lose_some_weight\/","text":"so i\u2019m 14 and a girl and I really want to a bit skinnier and i don\u2019t really do any exercise right now so here\u2019s my plan and things i plan on changing:\n\n-  go on a calorie deficit of eating 1600 calories a day (should i go higher?)\n- walking about 30 minutes to and back from school each day\n- no equipment body weight workouts 3 times a week for maybe 30-40 mins?

Recently started using macrofactor to track my foods. I work full time but my gym shares a parking lot with my office so no problem popping over there for workouts. My job is moderately active with a little heavy lifting. I also have no problems eating recipes that are vegetarian or vegan, etc. But i do like and eat meat.\n\nMy negatives, i have a really hard time cooking breakfasts or dinners on the days I'm working, even putting together a salad seems like more than my mental energy can handle. However i do like leftovers and usually prepare breakfasts, lunches and dinners on the weekends so i don't have to cook if i don't want to. Also one of the only foods i don't like is Greek yogurt, tastes like vomit to me when i eat it like yogurt, i am not sure if i mind it in recipes. I also am on effexor for pain and that probably isn't helping my weight loss journey but i have no idea if it typically effects appetite.\n\nThe biggest negative is i seem to be hungry ALL THE TIME. No matter what i eat, when i eat, etc. I just had a check up and i don't seem to have any underlying conditions that would account for the hunger.

My proteins being mainly eggs, lean chicken and cottage cheese right now.\n\nMy app has me at 2200 cals  150p 98f and 190c which should be more than enough for someone of my age\/size\/activity level.  \nBefore tracking i ate about 95% homecooked meals and never ate until i was \"full\" full, just full enough. In fact the most recent memory of actually being full was at Thanksgiving last year.\n\nMy hunger is all the time now and my stomach feels like a gaping maw that is never satisfied. In the last couple weeks I've tried paying attention, only eating a little of things that should help the hunger, or slowly eating\/chewing thoroughly to help. After a while though it's like i just don't have the mental energy to be good and just say, eff it and eat until it quiets the hunger.\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm not an emotional eater, only when i feel hunger, like stomach growling. I will admit during 2020\/2021 i did emotionally eat because you know tough times, and i work in healthcare so that didn't help. I'm pretty sure i don't eat when I'm bored either because rarely am bored (it's a blessing i know).

I'm 74 kilos(163 lbs) today, about 16-17% bf(my scale says 14-15 but it doesn't look like it)\n\nMy major issue is that my maintenance is very very low. At best its at 2000 and im pretty sure its lower.\n\nMy mates tell me to start bulking (I've been waiting for 2 years to really start bulking) except that I have a terrible fat distribution, it's all in my pecs (which have decreased a lot but I still have a big pseudo gyno), and in my hips. I'm around 16% bf and I'm 89 cm(35 inches) around the waist, in my last 10 kilos lost, I've barely lost 3-4 cm of fat. It's getting better in the middle but not at all on the sides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I wanted to get to say 70 kilos to see what I look like, except that I'm not losing anymore. I already did a diet break. I'm eating 1800 calories on average, it's not much but I'm maintaining it. This week I couldn't do any weight training because the chiropactor told me not to do anything for a week, so I did 10-12K steps a day (more than normal), with cycling on some days when I couldn't walk, so more cardio than a normal week + 1800 calories, I weigh myself every day, I'm at the same weight as at the beginning of the week, the measurements are the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn short, I don't know what to do. I'm fed up with restricting myself so much for the calories, I'd like to finally start bulking but I'd like to be able to go shirtless this summer at the beach, I've been dreaming about it for years, I've worked a lot but the fat  I still have around my belly+pecs is completely ruining my physique.\n\nI can't lower the calories any more, it's already really low, otherwise it's going to affect my workouts. I don't really want to walk 10K a day on top of the gym either, but as a last resort I can try.\n\nIt really pisses me off to have such crappy maintenance. I've tried to recompose with 2000-2100 calories but nothing happens, my body doesn't change and my weight stagnates too, I don't lose fat I don't gain muscle.\n\nI lost most of my weight between the summer of 2021 and January 2022, my physique hasn't changed much this year even though I'm giving it my all.\n\nIf you have any ideas, thanks because I don't know what to do.\n\nI'm proud of what I've done so far but I really need to get rid of that belly fat, I know you can't choose where to lose fat but its clearly the last bit I have and it's very annoying. I also have very broad shoulders, I could have  a typical V physique but its ruining it.\n\nAnd I really want to start bulking but I wanted to be leaner so I could enjoy summer..\n\nThanks","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678646551.0},{"title":"how many calories do I burn doing bumping Jack's for 40 minutes ?","author":"Damas_gratis","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11pykuu\/how_many_calories_do_i_burn_doing_bumping_jacks\/","text":"Last time I checked I weight 205.

I managed to lose 50 pounds in 2016 after diligent tracking of my weight and food intake on a notepad, but I had since gained all of it back (along with an extra 20 pounds) despite off-and-on dieting efforts from 2019 onward. I\u2019d lose 10 pounds here and there but I could never find my rhythm even with old strategies and ended up gaining all the weight back. I decided early last year to make a spreadsheet and log my weight every day regardless so I could visualize the weight I was gaining and losing in a graph. This is the result of a year of tracking. \n\nAfter one year, I\u2019m officially down over 35 pounds from the start and almost 40 pounds from my heaviest during this period (May 26th @ 264lbs). I wanted to share this post to show that weight loss is often not a linear process. Whenever I read or hear that someone lost 50 pounds, I usually picture their scale going down in even increments from the first day to the last day, but this frequently isn\u2019t the case. I had months of stagnation or even periods of weight gain before I could find my rhythm again to jump back on. There\u2019d be long stretches of time where\u2019d I\u2019d neglect my food tracker, but at least I was keeping a record of something to keep an eye on my progress instead of abandoning the goal of weight loss entirely. Staying accountable to at least one thing every day really helped me stay on track in the grand scheme of things. \n\nObviously there isn\u2019t a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d method for losing weight, but I hope that this post can inspire someone who\u2019s lost on a way to keep themselves motivated. I was always discouraged seeing my scale fluctuate wildly from day-to-day, but seeing the big picture helped massively in my case. I still have more than halfway to go towards my final goal weight , so here\u2019s to hoping I can carry this momentum and lose the rest within the next year.

Realistically, I need scales to have a max tolerance of \\~1lb, because  when trying to lose weight, you try to lose 1lb per week and do you know  how demoralising it is to get on the scales, when you're hungry,  working out more than usual and you see that you've gained 3lbs? (when  in practice you haven't, because if you get off and get back on,  suddenly you've lost 2lbs)\n\nI should add that I'm >100kgs. Yes, it's heavy. It might be that they're more reliable when you weigh less.\n\n**Wifi functionality, NOT BLUETOOTH**\n\nMost of them only support bluetooth, which means you need to connect  them to your phone. So what if multiple people need to use it at different times? Many of  the models will just refuse to connect to more than one phone. This is a  terrible idea. The scales themselves should be a complete device. My  Nintendo Switch doesn't require my phone to be played.\n\n**Connectivity**\n\nThey all connect to bespoke services by the manufacturer, which all seem useless. Just connect to Fitbit or Google Fit!\n\nAm I the only one who feels that *all* of the smart scales on  Amazon weren't designed by humans? I just feel that if done well, smart  scales could be an incredibly useful device to have in the house, but  all of them - and I mean **all of them**, even the ones which cost  \\~\u00a3150, have all of these same problems, judging by the reviews. And I'm  aware this might be people gaming the review system, but I can't risk  \u00a3150 just to *find out*.\n\n**Does anyone (UK-based) here have a set of reliable smart scales which do what I need them to do?**","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678630598.0},{"title":"Not sure if I should try and lose weight or not","author":"SIUUUMaster","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11pf15r\/not_sure_if_i_should_try_and_lose_weight_or_not\/","text":"I am a 22 year old male.

I'm a 17 year old guy; I currently weight 83.5 kgs and am exactly 6 feet tall. I want to get down to around 73-75 kgs and preserve lean muscle mass.\n\nI currently go to the gym 5 days a week; do intensive Cardio for around half an hour burning 300-400 calories and then lift for an hour or so. I focus on two muslce groups per day and have seen serious improvements in my strength. For example, three months ago i could not, for the life of me, do a single pushup. Today, I can easily do around ten proper pushups. \n\nThe problem, though, is that Although my strength has increased, I have not lost much weight. Yes, I have started to get a more defined chest and the mirror DOES show progress. But I feel like the progress is more towards strength and less towards fat loss (I'm trying to do both).\n\nAt the gym, I lift light since I'm not trying to get big and bulky, Instead I want to be lean muscular. So I lift light + higher number of reps (18-20 for 3 sets). Is this fine? \n\nNow, the most important part of weight loss: DIET! My diets confusing honestly. I usually eat whatevers cooked at home (I'm Pakistani, so typical pakistani food), but sometimes I get the random urge\/motivation to skip a meal and eat fruits only instead. I've tried in the past to have one consistent diet plan but idk it just never works, I always get tempted or something and fall off track. \n\nI graduate school in 3 months and am trying to down 8-10 kgs by then.

It's sustainable because I make sure I eat 3 hearty meals a day and a snack (all within my calorie range). However, it looks like a lot of food. For example, for lunch I had a large chicken burger and fries that came out to 700 calories. And early that morning, I had a Starbucks coffee and a breakfast sandwich (550 cals bringing me to a whopping 1,250 cals). Sure, on it's own it may look like a lot of food. But it fit into my calories and I still had 350 calories left for the day. Perfect.\n\nWell, my male coworkers have a habit of telling me how much I eat. And keep tabs on my meals. \"Wow that's a lot of food there girl\". \"Be careful eating all that food, you might start to look like us boys\". \"Better hope all that food goes to the right places.\" \"You are going to be (insert Spanish word for chubby here) soon.\" \"You don't need that\" - when I go to grab something from the break room.\n\nOr, when there is work lunches they say \"Better get to the food before (insert my name) gets there and eats it all.\"\n\nIn my head, I know I am losing weight. I know I am calculating the cals and doing everything right. I know that they are wrong. But it really messes with my head. I start to really doubt myself and I question \"Is this a lot of food?\". \"Should I eat fewer calories?\". \"Am I really losing weight, or is it not even noticeable?\". I know they are just \"joking around\". But it hurts my feelings. They make me feel like I am some out of control person that can't stop eating. And it triggers my body dysmorphia. I start to look like my old self again and panic that I am not making any progress.\n\nI know I need better boundaries. But it's hard.

I achieved the \"goal weight\" I wanted to be and maintained it for over a year almost solely thru distance running (its zen\/calming for me), but I still wasn't happy with my flexibility or muscle tone.  I had added some weight training and yoga to my routine, but wasn't consistent with them and never got the results on that side of things that I wanted, in part because my muscles really just...seemed to reject my efforts.\n\nI got frustrated with my lack of progress and I decided to \"take a break\".  It was only supposed to be a few months, but it stretched into a year, then several.  I got back on the horse a few times for a few months each thru the years, and managed to stay within 15-20 lbs of my lowest weight until about 2020.  Then I just gave up, and by the end of 2022, I was at the highest weight of my life and 50 lbs heavier than my healthy weight.  I was miserable, and I finally gave myself a kick in the pants to fix it.\n\nI started as a ball of dough: really minimal cardio capacity, really poor\/non-existant muscle tone, flexibility ziltch.  When I started this time, I thought about where I'd landed the last time I was at a healthy weight and the things I struggled with then, and I decided this time to focus my workouts on muscle toning\/development and flexibility with some cardio thrown in rather than the other way around.  I've been at it just a little shy of 3 months now, and I've lost 19 lbs so far. However, the biggest thing for me is how happy I am with my progress on muscular tone and flexibility.  I can see muscles showing up in my arms, my legs, my calves, even a little bit in my stomach.  I can almost get into the side splits on both sides, FAR exceeding the progress I made toward my flexibility goals EVER before.  These successes, even more so than the number on the scale, make me feel like I'm really winning this time.  I struggled so hard when I was in shape before to attain these goals, and I think because I had built my fitness thru distance running last time, it just built muscles that weren't really intended for the other goals I wanted.\n\nSo, for me, starting over has been a huge success so far because it's allowed me to focus on the goals I ultimately want.  If you're in the same boat I am, where you've never been able to meet your fitness goals before and are starting from zero, I want to tell you that you can do it too!

I have struggled with my weight my whole life. My mom taught me about Weight Watchers when I was 9 years old. When I was 11, I wrote out a long list of foods that I was planning to cut out in order to get rid of my belly fat. For as long as I can remember, I have been desperate to lose 20+ kgs. Everyone else in my family is very thin and athletic, and I've always felt like the odd one out. I feel like I'm addicted to food. I have no off-switch. I very rarely feel full, and I could easily eat 5000 calories a day every day. Food makes me feel calm, it soothes my anxiety, and it's exciting to me. \n\nI am currently working my notice period at my healthcare job. It is a sedentary, isolated role (apart from the patients, obviously, but I only see them for 3-5 minutes at a time). I don't get a chance to chat to co-workers or have much of a coffee break. I am exhausted when my shift is over, and I am insanely bored. On my way home, I always go to the supermarket to get some candy to cheer myself up and reward myself for getting through another difficult shift. \n\nI have been living at my parents' house for the past few years (since the pandemic started, actually). They live way out of town, and we aren't very sociable as a family. I do have some very good friends but they don't live anywhere near me (and a couple of them have moved abroad). I only socialise about once a week, and our plans usually revolve around going out for dinner somewhere and eating thousands of calories. I have plans to move out, and I will be going to grad school in the fall, which is something I am looking forward to. \n\nI'm just struggling so much with binge-eating and comfort-eating. I weigh 200lbs now and am only 5'6, and my weight is just going up and up every time I step on the scale. I have no self-control. I have counted calories almost every day of my adult life. I have made endless nutritionally-perfect meal plans and put them all up on the fridge. The first couple of days go to plan, and then by Wednesday, I'm ordering pizza and saying 'I'll start again tomorrow' or 'life's too short' or 'I deserve nice things.' etc. \n\nThe other thing I feel it's important to mention is that I've never had any kind of romantic interaction. I have always felt so embarrassed about my body and am convinced that I'm too unattractive to date anyone, let alone have a sexual relationship with someone. I want to have a relationship, and I want to get married one day, and maybe have kids. At the moment, this all feels impossible because I keep self-sabotaging any efforts to get my life together. I don't exercise at all. When I come home from work, I just watch random crap on Youtube or scroll through social media (I spend about 2 hrs a day scrolling through Instagram), and I eat heaps of junk food. The food brings me a lot of comfort. \n\nIt's just so frustrating because I feel like I know how to eat healthily. I know what to do in the gym, and how to lose weight (maintain a calorie deficit by tracking your food and planning your meals), but I just CAN NOT STICK TO IT for more than 3 days. And then I relapse hard by eating a disgusting amount of food in one sitting. I have discussed this with my therapist and she says that I don't need to lose weight and that you can be healthy at any size. I want to lose weight though because I want to feel healthier, fitter, and more attractive. I want to eat better and work out. I feel like I'm in such a rut at the moment and I'd be so grateful for any support or advice.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678569471.0},{"title":"Why has my weight barely changed at all since I started lifting?","author":"dranskey","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11p48uh\/why_has_my_weight_barely_changed_at_all_since_i\/","text":"25\/M\/178cm\/83kg\n\nI want to preface this by saying that I am pretty certain I am not tracking calories wrong. A bit over a year ago when I was working out I was tracking my calories the exact same way as now. At that point I went down from 93kg to 85kg and back then I was only doing a 3 days per week program.\n\nI was gone from the gym for quite a while. I recently returned and the 13th now will be my third month back. This time around I have gone way more. Now I am doing Reddit PPL, so I have been following a 6 day per week. The problem is that this time around I have barely noticed many changes. I can definitely tell a difference in my biceps. Not sure if the right word is that they have gotten bigger or that they have gotten more \"defined\", but other than that I can't really tell too much. I weight myself in the morning every day and the weight seem to be fluctuating a lot. Some days I will be upper end of 83kg and some days around 84.5kg. I live a very sendentary lifestyle at the moment, excluding the gym. I will be eating 1500-1700 calories per day and I try to follow 0.8g\/lbs. So I have been aiming for 145-150g of protein per day. I feel like it doesn't make that much sense that this time around, even while eating at this deficit I am not losing that much? On TDEEcalculator I am putting in my stats and choosing sendentary rather than a more active lifestyle, because again, outside of the gym I feel like I am not super active.\n\nSurely it's a bit weird though that with my stats and the fact that I eat 1500-1700 calories per day, that my weight essentially feel like its maintaining? I am not really tracking anything other than protein and calories intake, so could that play a part? Here are examples of what I normally eat throughout a day:\n\nMorning:\n\nEhrmann High Protein Chocolate Mousse (152 cal & 20g protein)\n-------------------------------------\nDinner:\n\n100g rice (350 cal & 8.20g protein)\n\n200g broccoli (68 cal & 5.64g protein)\n\n300g boneless porkchops (390 cal & 60g protein)\n\nSauce made with 100g 0% fat greek yoghurt, half tbsp olive oil, 2 cloves of garlic, lemon juice and spices (127 cal & 10.3g protein) spread into 2 meals throughout the day.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nLate night:\n\n83g of protein bread (273 cal & 12.45g protein).\n\n100g cottage cheese (80 cal & 13g protein)\n\n4 eggs turned into scrambled eggs ( 259 cal & 22.14g protein)\n\nOverall: 151.81g protein & 1699 calories.\n--------------------------------------\n\nMorning:\n\nEhrmann High Protein Chocolate Mousse (152 cal & 20g protein)\n----------------------------------------\n\nDinner:\n\nChicken salad: 300g of chicken breast (360 cal & 69g protein) - 150g of low calorie cheese (246 cal & 24g protein). - 1 tomato (22 cal & 1g protein) - 100g pasta (360g cal & 11g protein) - 50g lettuce (7 calories) split into 2 meals throughout the day.\n----------------------------------------\nLate night:\n\n4 eggs for scrambled eggs (259 cal & 22.14g of protein) 1 tbsp of parmesan cheese (22 cal & 2g protein).\n\nOverall: 149.14g of protein & 1428 calories.\n------------------------------------------\n\nMorning:\n\nEhrmann High Protein Chocolate Mousse (152 cal & 20g protein)\n------------------------------------------\n\nDinner:\n\n100g pasta (359 cal & 12.5g protein)\n\n200g broccoli (68 cal & 5.64g protein)\n\n300g skinkstek, not sure about english word for it but it's also pork and it's quite lean. (310 cal & 58.85g protein)\n---------------------------------------------\n\nLate night:\n\n4 eggs for scrambled eggs (259 cal & 22.14g of protein)\n\n1 tbsp of parmesan cheese (22 cal & 2g protein).\n\n100g cottage cheese (80 cal & 13g protein)\n\n83g of protein bread (273 cal & 12.45g protein).\n\nOverall: 146.50g protein & 1523 calories.\n------------------------------------------------\n\nI would say that on average I am mostly eating what is presented in the first example. So I will pretty much always eat that protein mousse, kind of as a substitute for a protein bar or a protein shake.\n\nFor dinner it's always 300g of either chicken\/boneless porkchop\/skinkstek because I am able to hit my daily protein intake with them, while they are also low on calories. Along with 200g of broccoli, 100g of rice\/pasta and then 100g of the greek yoghurt sauce, for the protein from the yoghurt.\n\nThen for late night I will go for 4 scrambled eggs along with 100g of 1.5% fat cottage cheese and 1 tbsp of parmesan to take away from cottage cheese taste. Then 83g of that protein bread (Depending on if I need the remaining protein at the end of the day or not, and my calories allow for it).\n\nI have not added in olive oil into the equation for anything I cook. I use the cooking spray just for a quick spray which is supposed to be 8kcal (less than 1 second spray). I also do it only for 2 meals, the dinner one and the late night scrambled eggs. So even added into the equation it would be 20-30 calories at most from that end.\n\nSo what is the problem? Why is my weight not changing at all. What am I doing wrong? This is a repost from a different thread. Since then I have  been eating the same, so 1600-1700 calories per day. The difference has been that after each gym pass I have added 30 minutes of cardio on the stationary bike (from the past 2 days only). I just woke up and the weight is 84.9kg, which surely should be water weight. I also only poop like once every three days, so I don't know if that plays into the equation as to why the weight is barely moving.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678592471.0},{"title":"Dietician doubts and weight gain struggles","author":"Ashkat80","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11p2o12\/dietician_doubts_and_weight_gain_struggles\/","text":"I'm working with a dietician and I don't feel confident.\n\n To start, I'm an aspiring triathlete training for a half marathon and swimming a couple times a week.

In September of 2019, prompted by some family health scares and a general feeling that I couldn\u2019t keep going as I was, I started vegetarian keto, IF, and meticulously tracking my food intake. I weighed 520 pounds when I started, was in a lot of regular pain, could not get a good night sleep, and got winded walking up the one flight of stairs to my apartment.\n\nToday, I weigh 223. I do 30-40 minutes of HIIT every morning, eat healthy meals, and have my routine pretty much dialed in to where I\u2019m able to handle the curveballs life and work throw at me.\n\nHere are some things I\u2019ve learned the hard way:\n\n-\tI am completely capable of reversing it all and winding right back where I started. Last year, amidst the stress of a new job and losing my dad to cancer, I put 80 pounds back on in a matter of months by eating sugar, non-nutritive foods, and generally \u201csoothing myself\u201d by actually hurting myself. If I am not careful and in a routine, my body\/mind are determined to store fat and excess weight. I recently listened to a great podcast episode that pretty much exactly captured my experience, and highly recommend checking it out here: https:\/\/overcast.fm\/+oiPVyuGxU\n-\tEating is the way to manage weight. Exercise on the other hand is not an effective means to weight loss. Exercise isn\u2019t going to make up for poor diet, but it will absolutely help make you happier and healthier overall.\n-\tStress management had to be front and center for me. Without practicing good stress management, gratitude, mindfulness, none of the changes would\u2019ve stuck. Prior to 2019 I\u2019d yo-yo\u2019d up and down, had a lot of success losing weight and exercising, but had never really fully faced the stress\/mind piece. With the help of a good therapist and some meaningful changes in the way I talk to and about myself, I\u2019ve managed to figure out ways to get myself mentally in a positive place. That makes a world of difference.\n-\tTracking is going to be with me from here on out, as is IF. I may take some days off here and there, but tracking is a form of mindfulness for me. Weighing every week, same day\/time each week, keeps me honest with myself and accountable.\n-\tSocial pressures are real. Honesty and forthrightness have helped me navigate those pressures. Being honest is a lot better than holding shame. Sorry work event, you\u2019re not more important than my health, so I don\u2019t have to have the drink\/appetizer\/box lunch. Oh, and yeah, get a good lunch box\/cooler bag to take to work.\n-\tHaving a handful of meals I really like that I can make consistently is amazing. It frees up so much headspace, eliminating questions about what I\u2019m going to eat, what I need to buy, how I\u2019m going to track food etc etc etc. I enjoy my go to foods and they are nutritious.\n-\tThe notion of will power is one of the more damaging lies the world tells us about weight. Weight loss is not a question of will power. Not sorry. Our bodies want to gain weight. Evolutionarily. The modern world is working to get us to consume. I couldn\u2019t will myself out of it, and still can\u2019t. It has taken a lot of education, support, routine, and outside help. Will power was not nearly enough.\n-\tThe hardest lesson for me: I am a good, whole person, no matter what I weigh. The world is cruel to those of us who struggle with weight. We get told that it\u2019s all a matter of will power, and so we carry shame when we fail. Accepting that I am a good person regardless of what the scale says is an every day decision. Not easy every day, but worth it.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678476695.0},{"title":"My goal weight maintenance is nearly 1900 calories.

I know that's still overweight with a bmi of 25, but I've gone below 150 and I don't like the way I look below that. I'm a solid size 6 between 150-155 and I just have no desire to be smaller than that. It's already hard enough to find clothes when you're larger, I dont want to create the problem of not being able to find clothes because I'm too small, haha. A size 6 seems like a nice, healthy in the middle range.\n\nAccording to tdeecalculator.net, as a 33 year old woman, I should be eating what amounts to basically 1900 calories while lightly active, which is what I consider myself. My job is pretty dynamic in that there are in fact days where I sit a lot but I also get up and move a lot too depending on what's going on at work that day. At home, I don't really work out but I also don't consider myself \"sedentary\". I get up and move a lot at home just doing my day to day activities. I'd say I probably burn a fair amount in \"NEAT calories\". I almost never sit still, I fidget, rock or spin in my chair at work, I dance in the car, I take the stairs when I can, I try not to park super close to the entrance in parking lots unless I don't want to spend a lot of time somewhere.\n\nI know 1900 is basically my maintaince calorie level. I've eaten 1900 calories before and not gained weight, and even lost at times. Its really plenty of food and enough that I can even \"splurge\" sometimes if I just budgeted enough. Like, it's not a hard amount to work with and I could probably swing it if I made simple choices like avoiding obvious junk food and controlling my portions a little bit. It's really not that hard.\n\nBut yall, for some reason I cannot do this right now. Every time I try to track calories I get this weird mental block and my mind refuses to cooperate with me. I keep binging on sugar, having seconds, eating whatever at restaurants, drinking too much. Stuff I know is what's causing me to gain and obvious stuff I could change and it wouldn't be that bad.\n\nBut I dont know what's going on with this mental block. I don't want to really say that I can't because I know I can -- I've done it before. I just don't understand why I can't just do it if I know it isn't a big deal.

I think this is a subject that is not often talked about. Many forums and channels tend to focus on what an optimal day looks like and I thought I'd ramble about my day of eating twice my daily calories and why I am okay with it. \n\nYou could say that the day started before it had even begun. I always try to plan and look ahead of what I will be doing and eating the coming days to be able to plan out my foods and meals so that I can better be reaching my goals. This is something that I think many could benefit from, but I realize this might trigger some individuals that struggle with obsessive tracking\/eds. This could entail simple stuff like not eating a massive lunch if you know you are going to head out for a burger for dinner, as an example. It could come down to trying to time your eating with other aspects of like, such as exercise or other factors that might affect your eating that day. Personally, I try to also plan in when I'll be eating what, so that I can hit my protein goal mainly. \n\nI know today would be less than ideal calorie wise as I had lunch planned at a schnitzel place, which ended up costing me 2000 calories. This is fine, I've planned for it by expecting the hit. The day continued with some meetings and other work related stuff until I got home and accidentally extended my power nap into the evening, which meant I would be up longer than I would've wanted. This, in turn, means I'll be eating more as I'll be up for longer and will get hungry.\n\nAfter waking up I hit the gym and 3 hours later I got home and, as I'm writing this, I'm eating my final mean consisting of lasagna and apple cake, which puts me well into 4000 calories. This was unplanned, but shit happens. At a goal of 2000 calories per day (1000-ish deficit), I widely went over my goal.\n\nWhy am I fine with this? Glad you asked.\n\nI've noticed that, over the years, if you keep beating yourself up over single days, or even weeks, you will not see the bigger picture. Your journey isn't going to come to an end because of a single mistake (or several), it's all about the consistent effort you put in. \n\nSomething that I know other people struggle with as well is having the mindset of \"this days already went to shit, might as well eat as much as I possible could\". This is not something I recommend doing. Even if your day went to shit, embrace it, but don't eat just because the day isn't ideal. KEEP ON TRACKING. Of course it's going to hurt to add that 2000 extra calories or whatever into MFP or similar, but it's important to journal all days, even the bad ones. That way its easier to track how well you are doing over weeks, months or even years. Seeing that one 4000 calorie day doesn't seem so bad if the 2 weeks before and after that unfortunate day your calorie intake has been at a steady 2000 (in my case).\n\nI don't know if this is coherent at all, as this is just me rambling about stuff, but I thought I'd share my thoughts and maybe this could help someone struggling with these kinds of issues. \n\nObligatory excuse bad grammar, not native english speaker, etc. This mindset worked for me, YMMV!\n\nTL;DR: Don't beat yourself up over small slipups, or even massive ones. Get back on track and try to plan your eating so you keep the bad days to a minimum","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678488458.0},{"title":"Tips for resisting eating out?","author":"RemoteDragonfruit318","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11oo6aj\/tips_for_resisting_eating_out\/","text":"Hey all. \nI\u2019ve recently started going to University in the city.

It fits normally, but looks a bit loose at the waist. And the size 27 skirt I got because I thought this is what my size will be after losing weight.

I'm a 160cm tall woman, and started from 103kg. Went down to 96 in 4 months, progress was extremely slow (got some hormone issues), but it was happening.  Then came christmas. \n\nMy mom knew about me wanting to lose weight and I told her about wanting a scale that counts bodyfat (and all kinds of shit) too since I was curious and my scale was old and dying all the time. She asked me if I wanted a new one for xmas and we chose one together. It was pretty expensive as well. When it arrived I was excited to try it.\n\nI kept getting errors when it was measuring bodyfat, and after looking at a bunch of shit, I finally found out why from the manual. My bodyfat was too high for the scale to measure it. Since my family was looking for the reasons why it doesn't work, I had to share that with them too. And for some reason, that dealt an absolute blow to my self esteem. Not only did the scale basically tell me I was too fat (thx I knew that already), I had to tell my family which just made me feel defeated, and my christmas present was also useless.\n\nI felt like shit afterwards and it really set the mood for the next few weeks for me. It wasn't even a conscious decision at the time, but I pretty much just gave up. I felt like an absolute failure and that the last months progress was for nothing basically. I couldn't get myself to care about counting calories or getting myself to exercise and slowly stopped doing these altogether.\n\nNow it's march. Looking at the rate I was losing weight, I would most likely be down \\~11kg from the initial starting weight if I hadn't stopped trying. Instead of being 92kg and working my way down, I'm back to 101kg. The reason I started losing weight was 1, I was unhappy with being unhealthy, and 2, time was going to pass anyways so why not just eat a tad less and work out. That mentality didn't persevere through a shitty experience and I'm almost back to square one.\n\nI think this is just a warning for people and I wish somebody said this to me after I lost all my confidence from a fucking scale; It doesn't matter what a horribly designed scale says or how slow your progress is, you're not failing. You're actively trying to lose weight and doing your best to live a healthy life, one that you are happy with. A really bad experience from something so superficial compared to the effort you've put in is not worth it for you to give up. And I can tell you, if you do, the only thing you'll be left with months later is bitterness about why you cared so much about such a stupid thing, and ironically reversed progress because of it.\n\nBut I guess this all comes down to the fact that losing weight can be just as hard of a mental battle as it is a physical one, and sometimes emotional support is what you really need. I didn't share how terrible I felt about this whole thing with anyone because I was scared of being judged (someone confirming that I am indeed a failure which makes no sense if you've got decent people around you) or shedding a few tears in front of others. In turn, I have to start again, cause obviously I'm still not happy with my weight and health. \n\nPlease, look out for each other and don't be scared to share your feelings with people who are safe to share them with. You never know just how much it can help someone in the long run.\n\nAs for me, I am starting my journey again today, and this time I'll be wiser and more persistent than before. I'll also ask my family and friends for emotional support if needed.\n\nGood luck people.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678438564.0},{"title":"Is it that bad if I'm consuming less than half of my daily recommended calories?","author":"CDNBacon89","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11o5rgg\/is_it_that_bad_if_im_consuming_less_than_half_of\/","text":"I'm 6'1 462 lbs as of this morning(almost 50 lbs down from my highest). \n\nMy TDEE is in the realm of 3500.

It\u2019s almost like because I\u2019ve never made it this far I just expect myself to fall back into bad habits. I\u2019ve been having intrusive thoughts of like \u201coh but doesn\u2019t this junk food sound good?\u201d And then I start thinking about the idea of never being able to eat that food again and freak out. It\u2019s almost like I am trying to find excuses to break my diet.\n\nI have a really bad relationships with food. I think it\u2019s because I always associate food with enjoyment. My favorite part of my day is when I get to curl up in bed at night and watch a few episodes of my favorite tv show and binge on junk food, and it\u2019s really hard to shake that. It\u2019s been helpful for me to not restrict what I can eat but to instead just restrict calories, so if I want junk food that\u2019s fine as long as I don\u2019t go over my calorie limit. But I feel like this is a really unhealthy habit and I\u2019m not sure how to shake it. I\u2019ve been trying to eat as little as possible during the day so I can spend all my calories on junk food at night. I\u2019m worried that if I try to limit my junk food intake I will revert to just binging because I\u2019ll feel restricted. \n\nI also feel like I always get into a diet and see progress and then find an excuse to stop my diet and \u201cstart again tomorrow.\u201d For example, with St. Patrick\u2019s Day coming up I\u2019m fighting the urge to break my diet because \u201cI can\u2019t restrict myself on a holiday\u201d but then I\u2019ll start my diet after that and find a new reason to break it.

There was a time for a few years before covid where I was still overweight but was moderately healthy, down about 100 pounds from my start weight and much stronger and faster than I am now or really ever have been.   \nThen a tumor developed on my spine. Then Covid happened. So on top of not being able to go work out because of covid, I really couldn't walk for a really long time because of the back surgery I had to have to get the tumor removed.  \n\n\nFast forward to today. I am able to walk fine now, and things have opened back up and I'm sitting here writing this post on tinder on day 2 of my journey to become healthy again.  \n\n\nFor context and advision purposes I am 5'7\" and 364 pounds currently. I wear a 2-3XL shirt and havent worn pants that are measured in numbers in years but I usually wear joggers that are 2XL or 3XL as well.\n\nI am about 45ish pounds HEAVIER than I was before I started losing weight the first time. I have some other back problems associated with my weight, and it's really causing a lot of hardships in my life. I loved playing music before C19, and now I am in a band that plays shows very frequently and when we play a long set my back starts to hurt so bad that I can hardly stand it and a few weeks ago we played 2 shows back to back and the second day I had to like actually sit down and take a break on stage because of how badly my back was hurting. When we got back home I ended up going to the doctor and they told me that I had a herniated disc in my back and it was probably caused because of my weight and how my body holds itself up.   \n\n\nYesterday, I threw out every sugary snack, every soda, and every back of chips and the like, deleted every fast food app and delivery app on my phone (except for the one for the grocery store I shop at so I can get my groceries delivered) started a new gym membership, went to the gym, jogged .3 miles, and did some weights workouts. Prior to covid I had a 7:48 mile time and now I can't even go a mile at all.\n\nI don't want to give up playing music, and I don't want to give up on myself.   \n\n\nI guess what I am really after is some advice to get back on track. Also recipe recommendations for better food. The one thing I'm scared of is that when I lost all the weight I lost before I was a vegan and I feel like that had a larger than ideal hand in me being able to lose weight. Now today I am not vegan. I'd be willing to go back if that is what it absolutely took, but if at all possible I'd like to remain on a regular diet.\n\nAny advice or sage like wisdom you guys can pass my way would be very much appreciated!\n\nThank you in advance!","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678490935.0},{"title":"Knowing when to change things up is crucial","author":"singingsomber","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11nso6k\/knowing_when_to_change_things_up_is_crucial\/","text":"Hello all!\n\nI will make this succinct, for the sake of all! haha! :)\n\nI have been anorexic, binge eater, obsessive, healthy, etc. etc. etc. yo, yo dieted. I have only been overweight once, but largely because I get horrible stomach aches from eating too much, that is literally the only thing that has saved me from becoming extremely overweight. Food has always been emotional for me, I got judged young for being chubby, being thin, nothing was perfect. I turned to binge eating after being sexually harassed by multiple people. All this to say all of this has been very emotionally charged. \n\nI lost 30 pounds last year from CICO. This is a wonderful way to lose weight. I also am now in a rut where I can't handle counting anymore, I am overeating and bingeing again because I stress over making sure I have enough to eat, I am no longer listening to my hunger cues at all. I am still working out the \"why\" of this, I was planning on counting for a long, long, long time. I had many plans. This isn't working for me now. I have decided to switch to intuitive eating, using a sliding scale of eating at when hunger is a 6-8 (10 being starving) and stopping when I am at 3-4 (1 being extremely full). Hoping for the \"just satiated.\" Also my focus is how healthy my plates are, and making sure I don't eat too much processed sugar. \n\nAt this point aren't you happy for the brief version? haha, this is getting long, I know. The details are for those who like them. \n\nI am writing this as an experiment. My BMI currently is 23.2, I got down to 21.4 and then just kinda didn't like the CICO anymore and binged a lot. I wasn't even hungry, the food didn't even taste good. \n\nI am not one who looks good with excess weight, sadly I have a small bust and do not carry weight well at all. It's ok, my body type is different. There are plenty of women who look DROP DEAD GORGEOUS at the BMI I am at now. \n\nI am already decently strong, I plan to become stronger and do pilates and intuitive eating. If anyone is interested in an update (including this sending me off the rails haha) I will post again around 1-3 months, depending on how well or horribly this is going.\n\nThis is not a sign to get off CICO if it's working for you. I am all for CICO, it is simply amazing and works!!! This is for people who maybe have a hang up and know they need a change. Maybe even just for a little bit.\n\nI have a goal weight, I more have goals for body measurements. I am also pragmatic enough to stop before my goals if need be. I am at a healthy weight, but again, I do not carry weight nicely lol. \\*weeping silently\\*\n\nThis sub has been SO helpful for me. When I was a few pounds overweight (with stabbing stomach pains everyday) I didn't think my life could change. Between this and progress pics I found new hope to start again, that and finding out about TDEE and how metabolisms can only vary around 200 calories for the same people with height, weight, activity and strength levels (don't quote me on this but all the reading I did said this). \n\nGood luck to everyone on your journeys!!! CICO again is amazing. I just need a break and am hoping this will help me. We will see. \n\n(again, CICO is great. I am purposely not posting this on CICO as I am not trying to derail anyone.

I've been on a WL journey since last year. I've lost nearly 70lbs\/31kg and feel really awesome but I'm a bit discouraged about a current plateau so I'm looking for some advice.\n\nA little background:\n\nI'm 26f (5'3\"\/160cm) and early last year I was at my heaviest of 220lbs\/99.8kg. I was suffering from my dysthymia and my career just going down the toilet. My family and I are all built a bit heavier with endomorphic bodies on both sides, so I've always been a bit chubby even as a kid. Even when I was running track in high school and doing a ton of exercise everyday, I was still about 145lbs\/65.7kg. In college, I lost weight from bad habits \ud83d\ude2c and managed to get to about 130lbs\/58.9kg before it came back due to severe mental health issues in my last year of college. After I graduated, I just kept ballooning. Well, I had a realization moment after getting laid off by the company I worked for and decided to work on switching careers. I felt much more fulfilled and it encouraged me to get healthier. You know, go to therapy, see a doctor, change my diet, the usual. \n\nI started using Lose It to help track my calories. After shedding around 30lbs, I also started doing a bit of exercise. I started small because my office job basically had me too stressed out and busy so I'd become lethargic over time and packed on weight with terrible eating habits. I live next to a park with hiking trails, so I decided to start exploring around.\n\nNow it's 2023. After following this routine, I now log 10k steps daily from going on hikes in the woods. My diet is cleaned up, no fast food and less sugar and carbs, but still balanced (I can't do keto because of genetic kidney things, my urologist said it's a no go). I also had a breast reduction after losing the weight in December. Again, just genetic; everyone in my family is very busty and even as a preteen they were uncomfortably huge. I went from a 36K cup to a 34DD. Very very happy and confident now, far less back problems.\n\nI am now 152lbs\/68.9kg (yay!). My daily intake limit is around 1500 calories right now.\n\nMy problem is... I've been stuck at 152\/68.9 for about 2 months. Sometimes it fluctuates a little, but I just can't seem to break under 150\/68. I also haven't really noticed my waist size shrinking much. It's very frustrating because my ultimate goal is to get to 135lbs\/61kg, and I've been stuck at my current weight for much longer than my other plateaus. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice to give? I can't do a lot of weight lifting because of scoliosis, but I really want to shrink my flat tire. I know you can't target specific areas of fat, but I'm really hoping to lose that last milestone of weight.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678468664.0},{"title":"Do teens really have a higher tdee than adult counterparts?","author":"bruhimwaytootiredfo1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11nycl5\/do_teens_really_have_a_higher_tdee_than_adult\/","text":"Hey y\u2019all!

I want to be around for a while and the way I'm living my life doesn't sustain that. I'm looking for some systematic methods to support my weight loss journey. I'll talk a little bit about my current diet and workout patterns, where I've been previously, and what I'm looking to in the hopes that y'all could maybe provide some additional advice.\n\nI've been overweight my whole life. It's always been something that I've struggled with. While this hasn't impacted by abilities to push myself, like doing Marching Band in high school and pushing myself to 30-45 minutes on the elliptical, I haven't ever made much progress in actually losing weight for a sustained period of time. One obstacle is the fact that I am in a fairly rigorous graduate program and need to better introduce a meal prepping and gym schedule that won't be too taxing, and could be sustained through just keeping it consistently in my schedule.\n\nIn terms of diet, I usually skip breakfast, eat school-provided lunch (that I can control my portions for) and then usually have to provide myself with dinner. Ideally I would like to meal prep breakfast and dinner options for myself so that I can eat less during the lunch hour at school. I've been really keen on working on responding to my hunger and fullness queues more, as I feel this is a big obstacle. I'm interested in other people's experiences with this? I'm a little averse to counting calories as I just am unsure of the sustainability of putting in that work at this time, to be honest--I also think it's hard to estimate for the school-provided lunch. I'm open to hearing your feedback about this--even if it is telling me to suck it up and to start counting calories. I promise I can take it haha! Additionally, do y'all have recommendations for healthy snacks? I've been doing yogurt, cashews, and applesauce, but I'm interested in any that may be more protein-filled or if I should think more carefully about snacking on these kinds of things.\n\nI would say that I have quite a bit of experience at the gym. Before the pandemic, I was good about going for 3-4 days a week, inclusive of a 5 minute elliptical warmup, 4-5 machines with a back\/bi, chest\/tri, abs\/legs split, and a 30-45 minute elliptical workout. I will admit--I'm not in nearly the same shape as I was back then. Additionally, I'm looking to be smarter about my workouts. My goals are to lose weight, obviously, but to also challenge my strength. When I'm *in* it, I love the gym. I love feeling sore.\n\n* I would love to discuss ways in which people stretch before training? I want to take care of my joints and ligaments and so I want to develop a good stretch routine.\n* What are some resources for developing a workout routine? I want to think about proper splits and progressive overload for a 2-3 day\/week schedule. The 3-way split I describe above works well for me, but is it smart? How do I challenge my strength overtime with upping volume in some way? When do I unload the progressive overload to give my body rest?\n* I can maybe do 10 consistent minutes on the elliptical at this time. I'm truly just not in the same space as I was a few years ago because of how little I made myself move during the pandemic. I'm not worried so much about advice about this, though. I know it will take time to get back to where I was and develop that stamina again.\n\nAny and all information is helpful! I realize this is a lot of info and I'm asking for a lot, but that's what this community is for, right? If y'all have any critique, I invite you to share it--like I said, I can take it. I just also ask that you are kind when you do so. I know we're all just trying our best.\n\nThanks y'all.","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1678472156.0},{"title":"Anybody on phentermine and Zoloft?","author":"Yogiigogetter","url":"\/r\/zoloft\/comments\/11ns8wh\/anybody_on_phentermine_and_zoloft\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678462542.0},{"title":"Feeling so discouraged","author":"kriiis","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11nnlv3\/feeling_so_discouraged\/","text":"I got really sick at the end of January with an autoimmune disease I have that has come and gone over the last few years but this time it hit me harder than ever.

I will post my progress in the comments under this post, so that you guys can correct me if I am going wrong, and also when someone else lands in this sub, it can possibly help them out in case i succeed.\n\nStrategy:\n\n* Calorie intake : 1400-1500 ( Minimum needed is 1200 and  BMR suggested is 1350, so hopefully I fall in the healthy eating category. I have decided what to eat and made sure I am taking  protein, veggies, fruits , nuts). TDEE is around 1700\n* Exercise : 2 sessions of 55 minutes each, one in the morning, one in the evening. Only 30 min of intense workout in the morning. Rest I will include some weight training and light dance workouts like zumba.  Add to that 3 seperate 10 minute sessions of climbing stairs. **5 days a week.**\n\nThis could look like a lot. But I have worked out before and think I can manage this.\n\nSo, these exercise sessions together constitute about 600-700 calories.\n\nSo, I am in a deficit of  800-900 cal per day **maximum**. Could be lower than that. But ,according to the advise I got, If I find this to be too tiring, I will opt for light exercises like playing tennicoit or badminton. I will keep the exercise type flexible and interesting.  I will add music to keep me upbeat. Only  the time I spend working out is fixed.\n\n**So, daily goals will go like this**\n\nDate:\n\nCalorie goal (>= 1200 and =< 1450) :Workout time: ( 2 hr 20 min,  Only 30 min intense workout,rest lighter workout):Water goal (3L):Sleep goal (7 hrs):Moisturization of skin:Supplements to take :Comments\/ Issues:\n\nWHEN DO I WANT TO REACH MY GOAL1 weight: I have not decided.

I (32, M) was at my highest weight (324lbs - 5'10\") and felt absolutely out of control. Every day I was wheezing any time I had to perform a physical activity other than walking, my shirts stopped covering my gut, and I was stuffing myself so full I could barely move. I felt like I couldn't do anything and needed an intervention.\n\nI had tried ozempic a few months ago but found that I was still eating at the same level I had been previously. I understand it can take months to begin to work, but it had cut my hunger, but I would still eat past my new threshold. The side effects weren't worth it in the end.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, growing up I would always binge out on any sort of junk food in the house. I remember not being able to identify my feelings around this, but what I know now is that I felt a lot of shame about my behaviour. I remember my parents having to put a lock on a deep freezer that we had so I wouldn't overeat anything in it. I don't think that my parents were necessarily restrictive with my food, but I know that anytime there was any sort of food that was remotely \"junk,\" it would be the first thing I went for. I was addicted to food and I was eating my feelings. In short, my parents were abusive and food was something that brought me a lot of joy.\n\nWhen I moved out on my own, it was game over for my waist and my wallet. Since I was 18, I've practically eaten 90% of my meals outside the house. I've had entire seasons change and go by with my stove and dishes untouched. I had always been a decent cook growing up, but I had no motivation to grocery shop or cook. I think one part stems from how overwhelming I find the entire experience, and another from having the fortunate ability to afford to eat out most meals. I was 200lbs when I graduated highschool and thought I was fat, though looking back at photos it's obvious I was very much a thin guy with some baby fat, still growing into my body. I wish I had been kinder to him.\n\nIn 2017 and at 275lbs, I tried Keto with some success, and lost about 40lbs before stalling and letting my food addiction take over again. For the past 5 or so years I've been stuck in a cycle of yo-yo keto-ing, while learning more about nutrition, macros, calories, etc. I know the way I need to lose weight is by nourishing my body with healthy choices, keeping my calories consistent (refraining from talking numbers as I don\u2019t want to trigger anyone), and becoming more active.\n\nSo for the past 14 and a half years, I have been in this non-stop cycle of binging, regretting my choices, and doing it all over again. Queue to a week and a half ago - I decided that I needed to get a grip on my life as my choices and addiction were weighing my down (literally, figuratively). I booted some tracking apps up, put on my apple watch, and told myself less eating out, no sugar sodas, and track EVERYTHING to the best of my ability.\n\nIt's been difficult. I have struggled holding myself back from going to Wendys and spending $20 on food I don't need. My brain is screaming at me for junk food and pop (soda, I'm in Canada and we call it pop). I have gone through insane withdrawals\/detox symptoms - My brain trying to convince me to give in just ONCE, a migraine at the beginning, higher levels of stress\/anxiety\/taking things personally, I slept almost 11 hours the third day, and other little things I'm blanking on right now. My addiction is trying to get the best of me but I will not let it win this time.\n\nI have noticed a lot of great things though in the short time that I've been actively making an effort to battle my addiction. I've lost some weight, exercise is easier (at the gym and for my daily walks), non-processed foods taste better, I reach for water now before I go for my caffeine\/sugar free bubbly drinks, and though I'm craving fast food options, I'm now telling myself if I eat out, I will look at the menu before hand and see what fits into my daily caloric goals. I am not trying to be incredibly restrictive right now because I am over 300lbs and even eating at an average person's caloric intake will still cause me to lose weight. I am honestly feeling better and healthier each day.\n\nYesterday I accidentally skipped lunch and began to have insane cravings for fast food. So I said to myself, ok, I've gone an entire week without eating junk food and I've worked within my goals, why don't I go for something that I used to get? So I looked up what I would get at Five Guys and saw it fit within my caloric goals. I was giving myself a treat and giving into my brain. I knew I was fucking up. But I told myself, watch how I feel. I ended up getting what I always used to get, and I have to say that all night last night and still this morning, I don't feel good. I know it's only been just over a week of living my life on my own terms, but I know that how it tasted was not worth how I feel now and I know that I won't be doing that again unless I can absolutely help it, and even then, I'll go for a takeout option that is more nourishing to my body.\n\nI wish there was some cut and dry secret to the start of what I am hoping is my own success story, but to be honest, for me, I felt like I had no other option left. I was hurting myself and I finally recognized how out of control I had become. I didn't want to keep living my life in a vicious cycle of pain. I want to make sure that I stay healthy and am able to maintain that until I (hopefully) grow old AND still able to maintain my independence. Eating how I was eating was leading my down a very scary path that was causing me not to come to terms with my feelings, my own self image, or my own want and need to be able to do things that I can't at 324lbs. I began to understand that no one except myself was responsible for me, and that I would have to be the one to make this change.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678385263.0},{"title":"Failing at losing weight while building muscle","author":"sweetvanillaswirl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11ngz2a\/failing_at_losing_weight_while_building_muscle\/","text":"I'm pretty sure I already know the answer but I guess I'm looking to have it confirmed, or for more advice.\n\nI've been pretty successful (very slowly) losing weight with exercise and calorie tracking over the last few years. I do wish it was faster but it's been sustainable for me and that's what matters. I fell in love with strength training and did a lot of HIIT HIRT. Last April I hit one-derland for the first time, but only for a few days. Since then, I've slowly gone back up.\n\nA few months ago, I had a friend recommend a family member as a personal trainer. I will note he isn't certified or anything, just a person who in passionate trying to make a business from it after having lost weight himself. I was around 206lbs when we started, and shared  how much I love strength training and while I still want to lose weight, I enjoy  weight lifting and feeling stronger. So we've been building up my strength quite successfully for the last 4 months, averaging 2x a week. I usually workout at home with just dumbells and body weight so having someone instruct and push me in the gym has been great! \n\nHowever, my weight has only gone up. I'm constantly leveling up my lifting and definitely building muscle and feeling strong, which is awesome. But I also am obviously more hungry, and know I need a lot of protein for muscle to grow. I'm trying to stay in the 1700 kcal range and usually end up at least under 2000 which is still technically a deficit from my base rate, but I know the weight gain (or at least lack of losing) isn't just from gaining some muscle. I admit it's been a rough few months and my eating habits haven't been as good as they used to be, but definitely not too crazy. I've gotten my sugar cravings back under control and am snacking less.\n\nI stopped weighing myself every day because seeing it go up has been bad for my mental health, but it's pretty consistently between 209-211lbs for the last three months. I also convinced myself even if I wasn't losing, I was feeling better (mostly true) and my clothes were fitting better (also mostly true) so I was likely losing inches. Well I decided to measure myself for the first time in a while only to find I'd either gained or stayed the same basically everywhere. It was so, so disheartening.\n\n**TLDR:** I started focusing on building muscle while working out 2x a week at the gym and sometimes one HIRT routine at home, but have been gaining weight instead of losing any. I've also been hungrier due to growing muscle and have had trouble reigning back into my deficit. Should I stop focusing so much on building muscle and increasing my weight lifting and instead refocus on losing weight by more cardio and HIRT and eating at more of a deficit?  Or do I just need to buckle down on the eating habits and keep up the strength?","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678429346.0},{"title":"How to get back on track?","author":"MH484849","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11n6hbw\/how_to_get_back_on_track\/","text":"Hey I 18m started my weight loss journey last September and have been going to the gym consistently 6x a week and have been in a calorie deficit.

I was a gym rat for many years but my pregnancy was very rough. I had many food aversions which led me to resorting to eating fast food since I couldn\u2019t tolerate the smells of eggs, chicken, garlic, onion and sometimes red meat. In my third trimester, I got a late diagnosis for gestational diabetes which also explained why I gained weight so rapidly towards the end. Thankfully I was able to slow my weight gain by walking more and eat very low carbs until the day I gave birth. \n\nI gained a total of 50 lbs and I felt awful. However I had high hopes breastfeeding would help according to my OB and all the women on TikTok who said they lost all their baby weight thanks to breastfeeding. That wasn\u2019t the case for me. The stress, anxiety, cravings and sleepless nights made me retain weight. For 6 months I plateaued at 210 lbs with no weight loss in sight. On top of that I had a c section and couldn\u2019t be super active for 6 months so I could completely heal which meant no running plus it left me with an apron belly and very weak ab muscles. \n\n\nEarlier this year, when I hit my 6 month mark, I made myself a promise that I would lose the weight. I started doing calorie deficit again and I take 2-3 mile walks \/ jogs every day. I eat moderate carb and high protein which keeps me very full throughout the day. I incorporated collagen supplements to aid in healing my weak joints from pregnancy and now can jog up to 2 miles nonstop again\u2014something I haven\u2019t been able to do since 2 years ago. \n\nI also LOVE using Happy Scale and MyFitnessPal to hold me accountable.

That's all covered. I know what has how many calories etc. \n\nBut when I am there I will have no way at all to weigh my food.

The cook (I know her but not very well) always said at previous events \"If nobody needs bigger pants after this weekend I failed as a cook\"\n\nWhy is there no way to do it? Because it's a LARP and no phones 'allowed' out. Also no internet connection to look up calories.\n\nThere will be three \"big meals\" a day - breakfast Lunch and dinner. But also an endless supply of snacks always out there to take. And not just fruit or something. Think all kinds of finger food. Plus cake for coffee\/ teatime. \n\nWhat is my strategy? I have no idea. I know I will not succeed if I try to eat none of the snacks. \nAnd if I try toeat less at the big meals I will only stuff myself with the snacks.\n\nSo far I only got \"one bun for breakfast instead of 2-3 as I used to.\" And \"eat fruit as snack when really hungry.

I can portion control a bit but if I do to much of it I know I will just stuff myself on the fingerfood instead because they are all \"Just one small bite\".

Not something I am saying you should strive for.\n\nI do not have a link to a study at the moment, but feel free to google it. I am not sure how many people are aware. But there is a maximum per day amount of calories your body can use from fat. The current measurement that was quantified by Dr. Alpert using a number of weight loss studies, is about 31 calories per 1lb of body fat.\n\nSo, as an example. If you've got 50lbs of body fat, you can burn a maximum of 1550 calories from fat stores before your body starts to resort to other means. Other means is muscle or other tissue. I mention this, because I think further understanding of how our bodies operate will facilitate people to make smarter choices when it comes to fat loss.\n\nPeople sometimes do severe calorie restriction, or start to notice when they get closer to their goal weight they don't lose as much fat. That's because your body is literally maxing out. So please don't forget to adjust your calorie allocations based off your current weight and estimated bodyfat percentage to ensure you aren't causing harm in the chase for a lower weight.

You can dramatically impact your risk of disease by changing your nutrition. If you control what you eat, you can impact your health.\n\n1. If you are metabolically healthy, never allow your sugar consumption to go above 18% (\\~90 grams per day) and ideally keep it below <5% of your calories (25 grams per day). The fructose in sugar drives insulin resistance in a dose dependent manner.\n\n2. If you have pre-diabetes or diabetes, eat less of what is making you sick. Reduce your consumption or sugar to become \"less diabetic\" and control blood sugar by controlling carbohydrates (including sugar)\n\n3. There are many diseases and biomarkers that are directly or indirectly impacted by nutrition and insulin resistance. These include, among others, breast-cancer, glaucoma, dementia, liver cancer, cardio-vascular disease and all cause mortality. They each get worse with higher blood sugar, insulin levels and increased insulin resistance. (Interestingly gout\/uric acid seems to be the outlier)\n\n4. Energy balance is important once you are metabolically healthy. If you are not metabolically healthy, that should be the first goal. Lower average insulin levels are needed before weight loss occurs because your body only consumes fat only with low insulin levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: this isn't intended to treat or diagnose any individuals. It is for information purposes to understand how nutrition impacts near-term bio-markers and longer-term disease risk.\n\nI'm very willing to share the studies used in the model and\/or discuss the results.","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678385495.0},{"title":"I have lost 11lbs in 26 days is that alright?","author":"Impressive_Drawer394","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11mz6fo\/i_have_lost_11lbs_in_26_days_is_that_alright\/","text":"My starting weight was 16.13 stone.\n\nI have tried and failed so many times to loose the weight after my initial weight gain but I always fell off the wagon and ended putting even more weight on.\n\nI have been prescribed elvanse for my ADHD which has really helped keep my binge eating under control and in addition I have also began semaglutide but it hasn't kicked in yet so it's not made any adjustment to my appetite as of yet.\n\nI don't care if anyone thinks I'm cheating, you don't get a medal for losing weight without any help.

Before I was trying out different diets, never losing more than like 4-5kg. This time I changed eating habits, cooked healthy meals, cut down on sweets and takeaways and started moving a bit more. Didn't count calories, but by mid November I was down from 84 kg (185 lb) to 76 kg (167 lbs). Then my weight loss has stopped, I had 2 weeks holidays and Christmas so I was explaining it to myself as caused by more unhealthy food intake and less activity. I didn't lose any weight in that time but I also didn't gain any, so I was semi-happy with the result. In January I came back to healthy eating and I also took up more exercising. Unfortunately, the weight still stayed the same. Okay - healthy doesn't mean low in calories, so at the end of January I downloaded the app for counting calories and set up a calorie goal using the avg from a few online calculators.\n\nSo from the beginning of Feb I'm eating 1700 kcal a day and I increased exercising again. I have 3 climbing\/bouldering trainings a week, each \\~2-3h long and two 1h cardio visits at the gym (fast walk on treadmill 7km in 1h). Except for trainings I'm not very active since I work long hours and it's a sitting work. After 1.5 month of controlling calories, my weight still hasn't moved.

I learned self love, and forgiveness. It wasn't easy but over time, I fell in love with running in particular and got quite good at it. \n\nIn 2021, I found myself running  ALL THE TIME. I frequently ventured out on runs for 8+ miles just to be outside and get some air. I had no clear goals or aspirations, I just loved the feeling of sweat and an elevated heart rate. Lacing up, going outside for a few hours to simply run was the highlight of my day everyday. I dreaded rest days. My weight continued to stay off, and I felt happy and proud of my body and my mental strength.\n\nFast forward to 2022, the roughest year of my life. Early in the year (on my birthday), my mother lost her long battle with numerous health conditions. It was a long time coming, and I knew I grieved her loss while she was still here, but her death took an emotional toll on me. Once you lose someone, you start to see the role they had in your family. She was glue that bonded my brothers and dad. Now that shes gone, the relationships feel more casual. I often don't hear from them for months at a time. As the year progressed, I also got a divorce. It was my decision, but it wasn't easy.\n\nDuring that time, I went to a dark place. I gave up running. I found myself exhausted, emotionally drained, and worried about the future. I frequently sat at my computer, binged on junk food just to make myself feel better. I neglected relationships. I felt like I was swimming upstream with no end in sight. \n\nLuckily, I realized the trajectory I was headed. I reminded myself how running made me feel, and how hard I worked over the years. I became fearful I would fully slip into depression and gain the weight back. Excercise made me a better man, friend, and brother. Slowly but surely, I started making positive changes in my life. One of those changes was getting back into running.\n\nToday I ran 3.5 miles. Wasn't fast or pretty, but I did it. And I'm proud. It feels like my life is starting to get back on track, and I'm beginning to see the opportunities even in my failures. Now when I run, I release all the emotions that are holding my back but in a positive way. I feel the world shifts into perspective, and things slow down. I am also down back below 200, which is a huge mental threshold for me. Thank you guys for all the positivity here and encouragement.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1678324020.0},{"title":"How can I avoid loose skin?","author":"Rpoelirem","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11mwam3\/how_can_i_avoid_loose_skin\/","text":" Hi! first of all sorry for my poor english\n\nWell, I'm currently on a weight loss journey, I've been on this for very few weeks and I've lost some pounds already, but I'm starting to worry about loose skin, is it really unavoidable? cause at least for a few years I have no money for surgery lmao\n\nI'm currently at 162 pounds (73.5 kg) and I'm 5\u00b41ft tall (1.55m.) and I want to loose around 52 pounds (23kg), I'm 23 years old, female.

I\u2019m trying to get back down to 135. About a month ago, I posted about how I had been counting calories and working out for 6 weeks and I hadn\u2019t seen any progress. It was discouraging and I wanted to vent. But I was still going to stick with it. \n\nWell fast forward to now, and I still haven\u2019t seen ANY sustained progress. I got on the scale today and weighed 155 lbs. For a minute, it seemed like I was starting to make progress. I was seeing 152-153 some days, for multiple days in a row at some points. But it seems like I ALWAYS just end up back at 155!!! I just want to never see the number 155 (or higher) on my scale again. \n\nIt\u2019s discouraging because I know how much I\u2019ve been doing. Since my original post, I\u2019ve continued exercising (averaging an hour a day, sometimes even more). I\u2019m still counting calories. I just don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s possible that I\u2019m not losing any weight\u2026\u2026.When I maintained 155 lbs for the past few years with ZERO exercise and I was eating whatever I wanted. And now I\u2019m drinking mostly water, exercising, watching what I eat. And still nothing? I gave up soda and iced coffee (I used to drink both daily). And I don\u2019t drink alcohol at all anyway, so that\u2019s never been a factor. I\u2019m really getting discouraged now, because it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\n\nEven if I kept eating whatever I wanted, but incorporated an hour of exercise a day, seems like I should have lost weight. Even if I only changed my diet, but didn\u2019t exercise at all, still seems like I should have lose weight. But I\u2019ve changed my diet AND started exercising an hour+ a day, and I haven\u2019t lost ANY weight? I don\u2019t know what else to do at this point. Some people will say \u201ceat less\u201d. But I\u2019m already at the 1,280 calorie minimum set by Lose It. I\u2019m not going to starve myself or eat less than a healthy amount of calories, and I shouldn\u2019t have to. According to my Renpho scale, my BMR is 1,457 calories. But I still follow the 1,280 calories from Lose It, to create a deficit. It just seems like what I\u2019m doing now should be working. \n\nOne of my best friends only gave up soda\/sugary drinks, and she lost over 30 pounds. She still ate whatever she wanted everyday and she didn\u2019t do ANY exercise at all. I know it\u2019s not good to compare your progress to others. But it just seems bizarre that I\u2019ve given up sugary drinks, started working out consistently and counting calories.

I'm a 6'2 guy who started at 216 lbs. I started climbing and decided to lose body fat, and set a goal of about 185 lbs, which would put me at around a 14-15% body fat. So I started putting myself at a calorie deficit that I calculated with MFP (where I have been updating my weight) and set a goal of 1lb per week, in order to prevent as much protein muscle breakdown as possible. That resulted in what now is a 1900 calories a day diet, where I try to have about 150 g of protein per day.\n\nEarly on it worked, even better than I expected, and everything went on track. I reached 200 lbs by February, so 16 lbs lost in just 14 weeks, which was pretty much on schedule. And then this last month it completely stopped. I've changed nothing. I've updated my weight on MFP, which has lowered my daily target by about 100 calories since I started (which shouldn't be that relevant given the target 500 cal a day). I'd understand the weight loss slowing down, but this was like I hit a wall.\n\nI've never in my adult life have been under 200 lbs, which leads me to think that maybe I've depleted my brown fat and what I'm facing now is difficulty to mobilize white fat consumption, but it's just a guess. And the weight loss stoppage has only lasted a month (maybe I've lost 1 lb during the whole of February). For a couple of weeks there I thought that maybe it was the result of some strength adaptations (which I've gained), but that would increase my TDEE, not lower it.\n\nI already avoid sugars, I weigh my meals, and I have incorporated some other healthy foots in my diet, like sweet potatoes or kiwis. I still keep it quite high protein to promote muscle growth.\n\nAny tips to reignite the weight loss process and lose my remaining 15 lbs and finally reach a normal BMI for the first time since I was 14?","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678348794.0},{"title":"Failing at losing any weight","author":"Fun-Needleworker3368","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11mf9ww\/failing_at_losing_any_weight\/","text":"I\u2019m f 25 , 130lbs and 5\u20193.  5000 steps a day.

However, ADHD prevalence in overweight\/obese individuals is around 30%. \n\nIt gets crazier, in individuals who are obese, ADHD prevalence is 42.6%. \n\nBut you know what's the most shocking statistic? In individuals who are **treated** for their ADHD, their likelihood of being overweight or obese drastically falls to be in line with the general population. \n\n**And... this is just ADHD. Imagine what share of the overweight and obese community are battling other eating disorders that they don't even know that they have?** \n\nIf you think you have ADHD, please do the Adult ADHD Harvard screener. ADHD is associated with an eating disorder called binge eating disorder so look up the screener for that too.

It's not without its struggles, but I'm more motivated than I've been in years. \n\nHey, I'm a big lurker here, I made a post a while back about needing to lose weight. I was 330 at the time. Months later and several restarts, it's starting to feel different this time. \n\nWhen I started this time, I was 332, felt awful ALL THE TIME, both physically and mentally, and couldn't stop eating. Today, I weighed in at 312. 20lbs down. There's been a combination of things over the last 3 weeks that have really kept me motivated this time around. \n\nFirst and foremost, I'm a father now, my son was born almost 6 weeks ago, and he's one of my main motivators.  I want to be around for him,  I want to be able to play and do stuff with him as he grows up.\n\nSecond, and this may sound a little stupid, but the second main motivation for me is that I bought an expensive piece of clothing online, and when I put it on, it was too tight. I can't just return it because it's sold out of my size, so I'm very motivated to lose enough for it to fit. It's a stupid motivation,  but whatever works. Right?\n\nI've been able to lose this little and continue to lose by strictly logging everything I eat. My wife has been a huge help,  she helps me meal prep and measures everything very meticulously, so I know exactly what and how much I am putting into my body. I've also stopped drinking my calories and started drinking water with the occasional diet soda. I've also gone from eating 3 big meals a day to 5 smaller meals, and that's really helped my hunger, which has been raging. I originally cut my calories to 1500, but I upped them to 1800 for the time being, if I had stayed at 1500 I feel like I would have binged because my hunger was so bad.\n\nI'm working out 6 days a week, 3 days weight lifitng, and the others cardio, I've always really enjoyed the gym, and I'm glad I've reignited my passion for it. \n\nOntop of everything, even though I've only lost 20 out of the 120 I'm aiming for,  I feel SO MUCH BETTER. I'm already able to stand for longer, move around for longer, and I just feel good. I'm also really happy that I'm now closer to my first goal of 300lbs than when I started \n\nBut even with the little success I've had, it's been a huge struggle, I'm constantly hungry, though that's getting better. My wife and her family go out to eat a lot and I feel so down about not ordering what I really want, and I'm making good choices when ordering and, like I said,  I'm logging everything and keeping myself accountable. They've also been really good when we eat out. My kryptonite is mozzarella sticks, and they've been good about not ordering them. \n\nSo that's it, I'm seeing a moderate amount of success, I'm feeling good and more motivated than ever.

That\u2019s what was on the scale today. __That\u2019s within 1 pound of where I was in March of 2020.__ [Proof for you data nerds](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qzZlTEk.jpg). \n\nAnd, exactly 4 years ago tomorrow, March 8, 2019, I was 246.5 pounds and staring down at my stomach of sadness, unable to see my toes. Yes, [that was around the time when I let a stranger think I was pregnant instead of just fat](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/bis5tc\/head_shoulders_hidden_knees_and_toes_or_that_time\/).\n\nSo, why is this a big deal? Because I was a damn yo-yo champion. Like, the All Mighty Reigning President Queen of Yo-yo. I\u2019d spent my whole damn life losing enough weight to fit into my skinny jeans \u2026 and promptly celebrating my awesomeness with a piece of cake, and a steak, and some fries until, once again in short order, those skinny jeans would go, like a dejected orphan, to the back of the closet.\n\nAll too soon, the horrible moment would come when my sneering fat jeans \u2014 which were a bigger size each time \u2014 would emerge. \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nSo, what did I do differently to cash out my ticket to the Yo-yo Express?? Three things:\n\n1. I counted the calories. Like, *really* counted them. No more guesstimating. I used measuring tools, including a scale. And tracked them using  MFP. I STILL roughly count calories __because I know what a calorie is and where they\u2019re hiding.__ Lord knows I\u2019ve developed an eagle eye for the calories in peanut butter. That stuff is the devil.\n\n2. I stepped on that fancy scale my husband bought me. Every day for the first 2 years. __I\u2019ve had full screaming matches with that thing when it wouldn\u2019t budge despite my efforts.__ Then we\u2019d make up and it would reward me. I now step on it about 1x\/week because *I know* when I\u2019m feeling a bit tubby. Then I get my shit together and go back to step 1.\n\n3. The BIGGEST TRICK: __I ate roughly at maintenance from day 1.__ I figured I needed about 1700 calories on a lazy day. That was a smidge low, and I dipped about 8 pounds below where I ultimately settled in for the long run. More importantly, I *didn\u2019t* do what had been my pattern of eating: consuming the bare minimum to avoid passing out. If you\u2019ve ever seen *The Devil Wears Prada* and remember the scene with the cheese cube, that was me losing weight. No wonder I\u2019d go wild once I hit my goal, I was fucking starving! Instead, by eating at maintenance from the beginning, __I had a whole year of practice eating like a sane person by the time I hit goal.__ \n\nSo there was no Celebration Cake. I didn't need it\u2026 because I already knew how much cake I could eat and how to balance it out by going easy on other stuff. I never stopped eating *what* I wanted\u2026 just how much. \n\n\u2014- \n__Random stuff I\u2019ve done and noticed since I lost (and kept off) the weight:__\n\n\nBought a whole new wardrobe\u2026 and EVERYTHING looks amazing. I can\u2019t remember the last time I had a \u201cnothing to wear day.\u201d Even slouchy shit looks great. I can wear that baggy sweater because I\u2019m not trying to fool anybody that it\u2019s not hiding rolls and poor self-esteem. I will warn you that it\u2019s still a shock to see a clothing item you know is the correct size \u2014 because nearly every time I think *There\u2019s no way in hell that\u2019s gonna fit.* But, like magic, it usually does. Wanna see something wild? [Here\u2019s my not-even fattest jeans compared to the two I\u2019ve worn endlessly since 2020](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bgK0QEt). I nearly sent both of the skinny jeans back before trying them on to avoid the humiliation of not getting past my imaginary cankles. Oh, and my prior skinniest jeans only stay up with a belt and PMS bloating. The fat jeans all got donated in year 2 of maintenance. I don\u2019t miss them.\n\nFUN FACT: feet lose weight! Mine are still ugly as sin, but a size smaller! I had to buy all new high heels after admitting that I was likely to break an ankle if I kept trying to walk around in shoes that were literally falling off. \n\nMy PCOS just \u2026 disappeared. Well, the part where my cycle was a mess, and I had cysts on my ovaries. The chin hair, I\u2019m afraid, is here to stay. \n\nI can argue with my doctor about my weigh-ins over 2 pounds, and not ~~20~~ 50. Not my fault he told me to drink a bunch of water before I came to take urine samples, and I want credit for that! In all seriousness, my GP and OBGYN are enormously proud of what I\u2019ve done for my health. \n\n__Major injuries are easier to overcome, and do NOT doom you to regaining weight.__ In March of 2021, my dumbass was using poor form in a fitness activity, and I blew out a disc in my back. This is the third one. The prior two took nearly a year each to get past because I was so out of shape. This time was different because my core was already strong and my fitness level was high. I was back on my feet in a couple of weeks, exercising at a high level shortly thereafter, and competing at a national sporting event 5 months later in, arguably, the best shape of my life. THAT was cool AF. Oh, and weight at time of injury was 175.6 pounds, weight at competition was 178 \u2014 the 2 pounds came on after I\u2019d started weight-lifting again. The caloric difference between being flat on my back and fully competing was about 400 calories on my strenuous days. Knowing how to eat at maintenance was key to not packing on weight while I was hurt. \n\nSex life with spouse? Waaayyy more fun. __First, I\u2019m not trying to reproduce  the darkest places in the galaxy by turning all the lights off and closing the black-out curtains to hide the size of a lumbering tush.__ Second, things are easier to reach. Third, I\u2019m not out of steam from just trying to roll over. 10\/10 recommend. \n\n\n__My dog is no longer fat.__ She\u2019s still a complete doofus. I still  call her Gordita. Yeah, yeah [Dog tax.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/tv4M3Jb)\n\n\u2014-\n\nAnd you misfits here are the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.

My weight has stolen my life, literally every problem I encounter on a daily basis is due to my weight, but I just can't stop fucking eating. I can't summon the willpower for more than a few minutes to maybe a day if I'm lucky. I can't even work out at the gym because after a couple of months I started getting injuries and was just re injuring myself every time I tried to start back in. I'm so fat I know that to look like a normal human being I'm going to need surgeries I have no idea how I would afford (excess skin, large lipoma on my forehead, etc).. Usually my diet falls apart at the first major stress I run into, lately its been car related mostly as my cars been getting more unreliable and I'm literally completely fucked if it quits on me before I'm able to get enough money to throw more parts at it.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore. I'm pretty sure my environment is the biggest problem and thats literally the one thing I can't control. My family is pretty typical for the American south, large high calorie meals are getting cooked constantly and once foods in front of me I'm eating it. I also work as a cargo van driver which gives me wayyyy too much time to focus on thinking about food. Like I'm literally starting my shift daydreaming about lunch, which gets that weird painful fake hunger feeling going etc, but I don't think I'll get a better job until I get a college degree and even that seems impossible because even just sitting in a chair for more than 30-60 minutes has my back screaming. Literally the only time I'm not in pain is when I'm laying down. This has also ruined gaming which has historically been my main escapism, as I can't even play for long periods of time lying in bed because my arms go to sleep really easily these days.\n\nI don't know what to do, I want to lose weight. I know its ruining my life, I know I'm not going to survive my 20s if I don't. I know I'll never find love if I don't. I know I'll never achieve financial prosperity if I don't. But when I'm hungry, even the slightest bit, all I can think about is the next thing I'm going to eat. Sometimes I literally will just be in the kitchen wandering around in a stupor trying to figure out what will satisfy my current craving. Sometimes I'll eat one thing and it doesn't help so I just immediately fix something else until I'm full. Or I'll be ordering at a resteraunt and way over order, stuff myself nearly to the point of throwing up and think \"geez that was wayyyy too much. I would have been full with half of that\" and still the very next day there is a voice in the back of my head worrying I wont be full that tells me to make another gigantic order (which is weird because I've never experienced food insecurity). Its like a base, animal panic inside my head. I'm pretty sure my sense of full is completely broken. Full to me means \"I cannot physically hold down another bite\" and I even enjoy the sensation of choking down a bite of food that was wayyy too big. Honestly the only descriptions I've ever heard that align with what I experience all the time are people that have been addicted to HARD drugs. If you could OD on food I'm sure I'd have done it by now.\n\nI just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm in a chicken or the egg situation where my enviroment is perpetuating this behavior but to escape my current enviroment (IE: have enough money to live on my own) would require becoming a normal weight first. I read somewhere only 1 in 1200 people that reach my level of obesity will ever achieve a normal weight again in there life, idk how to become that one person. I successfully dieted @ 1600 calories a day for like 3 months a couple of years ago and lost 45lbs but it fell apart when I got fired from my dream job. It seems like every since then my body knows what I'm trying to do and fights back 3x harder.

For reference: F \\[18\\] 145 lbs 5'5\n\nMy ribs flare out quite a bit, and I'm actively working on improving my posture, though I've read that working out can help with that as well. They flare out wide and up, which can make me appear a lot larger than I actually am, they give me a very rectangular shape to my body, which frankly, I'm not a fan of. I'd also love to get rid of some of the arm and thigh flab. I'm fairly new to the fitness world as I've always been heavier and weak.

But I honestly am stuck! \n\nI have been on a weightloss journey for a few years. I am 80 lbs down. Through the process I developed a few health issues and have had to make major changes to my diet such as not eating processed food. I do occasionally if I'm out with friends or during Holidays.\n\nI have cut out a few things entirely like soda, pasta, bread, juice, most dairy products. I still have cottage cheese every now and then. \n\nOver the holidays I gained about 10 lbs. I was very busy and honestly lacked in my workouts and kind of had a free for all. These have been the most stubborn 10 lbs in my life. I have a total of 30 lbs I would ultimately like to lose, but before those 10 lbs it was only 20. Felt doable. Now I feel like I am just stuck! Besides meat, everything I eat is either a fruit of veggie. I make my own \"ranch\" out of nothing but veggies, I make my own \"tortillas\" out of spinach and eggs, I cook all my own meals at home and do everything I can to make everything from scratch. I could list it all but just an example, I really do eat clean. I workout 4-5x a week, both cardio and weights for both upper and lower body.   \nSince these 10 lbs have taken over, I have cut back A LOT! Portion sizes are half what they were and even went up in my weights. I am not losing anything.   \nMost of my meals are vegetables, so cutting my portions in half I already do not intake a lot of calories. My main breakfast is literally a veggie omelette with one egg, and sometimes a piece of turkey bacon or a banana. I hate breakfast but this is the only breakfast I can stomach. Has been for almost a year and I have a salad once a day. Either for lunch or dinner. I love salad so it's something I've been able to stick to for a long time.   \nSo my question is, WHAT am i doing wrong? I have been logging my calories as of recently and yesterday I consumed a total of 1,082 calories. This is with cutting my portions down comfortably.

Pairing that breakdown with depression and anxiety, I've gained about 40 pounds since then solely from stress, emotional eating, food addiction, and sedentary habits. So I'm starting again today to get myself back on track: intermittent fasting, cutting back on processed sugar and salt, and exercising daily. In the past I've struggled horribly with sticking to new routines\/habits because when I don't see results in the first couple weeks, depression hits and I end up quitting. But I've seen others using this subreddit as a way to hold themselves accountable, so I'm doing the same!   \n\nFor context about my weight loss journey, I'm a smaller woman and in my thirties, and given my frame even a little bit of weight makes me look bloated. I had family members make negative comments on my weight gain after I'd only gained 20 pounds--that's how noticeable it is, especially in my midsection where fat tends to store and ruins my silhouette. And it's hard to be sitting at 140 pounds and be told that \"that's not heavy at all, you look fine.\" It's not fine, not to me, not when my normal, healthy weight sits at about 100.   \n\nI'm tired of everything in my closet (save for pajamas) not fitting me, tired of not feeling confident, tired of struggling so much with food. I've been browsing this subreddit on and off for a while and have been seeing the progress others have made. So I'd like to post this here as a resolution to try again. If I hold myself accountable and manage to succeed, I hope to inspire others who are struggling the same way.   \n\nAny advice or tips are welcome! I will do a check-in thread in 2 months' time to let you all know how I'm doing and how much weight I've lost. I appreciate any advice or words of encouragement.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678270518.0},{"title":"embarrassment","author":"Ladderbabby","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11lejuu\/embarrassment\/","text":"I'm down 57 lbs and have felt good about my progress, but was absolutely humiliated today when I couldn't fit into a harness for rock climbing.

Happy for those of you who have had  great weight loss progress! It can be tough work. And for those struggling, from personal experience, it does get easier.\n\nMy story is simple. I\u2019m 21m, grew up gradually gaining weight from the \u201ceat until the food is gone\u201d lifestyle. Summer of \u201822 I decided it was time to make a change. Went from 240 all the way down to 189. That amazing feeling of being under 200lbs for the first time since I was in 7th grade!! I went on walks every day & strictly watched my diet. A mix of counting calories and heavy protein, fiber, and water intake. But, winter hit, and now I\u2019m back up to 205. For obvious reasons, the holiday season, I gained some of that back and lost the weight loss mentality. My goal weight by the end of this May is to be at or around 160. Which, at this point may be a little unreachable\u2026\n\nHow do y\u2019all recommend I curb the cravings? That is the HARDEST part that I\u2019m currently struggling with. I\u2019ll tell myself to focus on weight and I\u2019ve eaten plenty of food that day, but I get a little bored and a plate of ___ sounds great in the moment. Or it gets as bad as not being able to go to sleep until I have something sweet. My biggest one right now is \u201ca hot plate of ___ or a hot and fresh taco, etc.\u201d I did it once before last summer, but that mentality hasn\u2019t kicked back in yet.

What's the deal with calories burned while hiking?","author":"Past-Swan9395","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loseit\/comments\/11lpjkf\/im_ready_to_make_a_change_whats_the_deal_with\/","text":"Hi all, 24M here at 330lbs. In 2018 I lost about 80lbs, was down to 215, and gained it all back and then some. COVID times really helped pack in the last 50 or so, since it gave me an excuse to stay inside all day. I'm ready to make a change. I'll start with the problems that I could use some advice on, but know I'm keeping a positive attitude!\n\nThe problems: I've just started a PhD and a (very small) online business, and so I can totally get away with staying indoors *all* day without feeling bad about myself. That's making it extremely hard to lose weight, and being near the fridge doesn't help. I tend to really binge eat in the evenings, and can actually eat reasonably well until then. But after dinner nothing can stop me. I know I shouldn't be eating nonstop in the evenings, but whatever reason it feels almost impossible to stop myself. Additionally, my biggest motivation to actually whipping myself into shape is part of what makes it difficult: I'm finally starting to feel the wear and tear of obesity on my body. I'm having problems with my feet and back, and due to a pinched sciatic nerve that I can't afford to get fixed right now, my right leg goes numb after about 10 minutes of standing activity. Last problem: my wife and I cook 90% of our meals from scratch. I love cooking. In the past I have gotten so frustrated trying to keep track of total scratch meals on calorie counting apps. We change things up constantly based on seasonal ingredients and what we have around.\n\nThe good: I'm a vegetarian who barely ever drinks alcohol and never drinks soda, so there are a number of problem foods which I won't have to make the switch away from. Though I sometimes have a sweet tooth, it seems for the most part that the issue with food is about *quantity* more than anything else. Good food can still make you fat if you eat too much of it. Though walking on the street and gym exercise flares up my sciatica, I've found that (for a reason I have yet to identify) I have no issues when hiking. That brings me to another big question. If I put my fat ass into gear, I'm fairly certain I can fit a 1-hour hike into my schedule 3-4 times a week. When I use online calculators which factor in elevation gain and everything, my favorite hike apparently burns nearly 600 calories in an hour at my weight. There's no way that's true is there? I despise all other forms of exercise, so if I can really burn calories that efficiently I know what I need to do.\n\nI think I'm ready to make this happen. If anyone has insight, even if anecdotal, related to my ramblings here it would be greatly appreciated. I'd love to know if the hiking figures are wildly inaccurate or not, and how others have overcome the problems I'm running into. Thank you so much!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678259892.0}]
