I was always taught to double check when it came to money. I've been like this since high school because my family were penny pinchers. But sometimes a mistake is a mistake.\n\nYesterday, I had a delivery. Went to the guy, gave him his order, I was in a rush because it was supposed to be my last delivery and I really needed to get home to do some homework. He gave me the money, I counted it up, and put it in my phone. My mistake was forgetting how much the order actually was, then he looked at the ticket and then looked at me. He got this really smug face, and said \"How much do you think you owe me?\" I told him, \"I believe I gave you all your change back. Could be wrong. Let me check the sticker on the order real quick.\" And he said, \"Yeah. You're wrong. You know how I know this is your first day?\" I told him \"If I misremembered the order total, or miscounted, I'm happy to settle it up. Let me see the sticker on the box.\" And he just snapped \"You owe me $1!\" So, I give him a dollar. And then he, slowly, counts a $3 tip for me from the change. \"1, 2, 3.\" I said thanks, have a nice day and left. And he stared at me with this smug ass face as I drove away.\n\nI remember encountering a few of these assholes at my high school job over a decade ago. Where, in the middle of a dinner rush, they wanted to stay at the counter and instead of just say how much change they were supposed to get back, they want to give you an impromptu lesson about how to make change.  And then they would invariably recount the story to their table and act like it's the fall of civilization or some shit.\n\nMotherfucker, I don't have time for that shit, you pasty middle aged shithead.

        "text": "Okay, I know I've only been around about a week, but tonight was a HUGE pain in my backside!!\n\ngather 'round as I tell my tale.........  (scroll down to the **bold** for a little less ranting)\n\n\nSo, I get to work and not a lot is going on, it's a slow night.  I am used to zooming here and there for my shift without much of a break.  Earlier today we had a meeting before the store opened because inspectors from HQ were coming to do an inspection of the store... goody I thought, I left the military with it's millions of 'random' inspections just to jump into another, but no big deal.  So, we go over labeling, placement of things, cleanliness, ect. then we were released.  I came back in at my 4pm shift and was doing my duties that start my shift, when the other evening driver comes in throwing a MAJOR bitch fit about \"not gittin' hur pay, dey ain't gun pay me!\" she's screaming... then goes into the back and starts slamming dishes and cursing about anything and everything, mind you customers are in the front, some with little kids! (we don't have a sit down area, just a few chairs to wait on food if they want to, we are just delivery and carry out.)  Then she storms off on her delivery run.  Soon as the door closes behind her, the night shift manager (B-man on the store totem poll) turns to me and goes, \"sorry man but I'm going to have to pull you from deliveries and have you learn prep stuff...\"  He looks like someone just ran over his puppy as he's telling me.  Now, being the 'new guy' I figured it was a seniority thing, which I'm okay with, still bullshit that I have to 'ride the pine' because miss ghetto is crying about not making enough money...  The other worker told me, as she's showing me the prep work, that \"sucks that they are doing this to you, but it really helps me out in a big way.\"  nawww how sweet... but my 7.35 and hour to prep while the 'cooks' get 10.25 and hour is not helping my bank account out, in the least!  Then the manager comes back and apologizes again, and shows me a text from the top dog manager that said, \"yea just appease her and give her the deliveries, m0bius2 can do something in the store and be cut out whenever you want to let him go.\"  (b-man kept me till 5 minutes before my shift ended, to 'kind of compensate')  So, that had me pretty angry about it being benched.  Don't get me wrong, if I'm not doing a delivery, I don't mind knowing how to prep, make, or cut to help out, once MY duties are caught up/completed.  In fact, I have barely stood still in the store when I am not out making a run, I'm finding something to do or clean (cause there's ALWAYS something to clean, am I right!?).\n\n**START HERE FOR A SHORTER READ**  LoL\n\nOkay, so I vented about that now I get to the part I want to know about; are there any rules or regulations (other than the FDA or something like that) that I can physically look at that say anything about 'civilians' or by-standards in the work area?  I ask because miss bitch-fit took off for 45 minutes (on the clock) to go get her kid!  Yep, had him in the shop from 645 and she closes tonight, she even left him in the store while she went out on a delivery!  Now, if the kid would have sat in a chair and did homework or something no biggie, but no, this kid was running all over the place, messing with everything, going in and out of the fridge, at one point the kid was outside playing with cigarette butts and then went running down the aisle giving all the pizza boxes 'five' as he run by cheering to himself...  Everyone in the store didn't seem to pay it any mind, but that can't be legal........ can it?!?!  Being ex-military I like to have my facts in a row before I make a complaint so the supervision can't try to tip-toe out of it.  I don't want to be in that store and that kid fall into the fryer and somehow be blamed for it...",

Fascinating stuff! I love it all! You guys rock. Lots of shit you really have to deal with. You are like the Marines for pizza... on the front lines.\n\nIve got questions. Its rare I order from the major places in my area anymore... Dominoes, Pizza Hut &amp; Papa John. I actually like Round Table better than those three if I had to pick. One major reason I started making my own pizza was the major chains have all sort of additives in the pizza... cellulose (wood pulp) as well as antibiotics in the cheese. But from time to time I still order a pizza pie from you if Im out of wood, its raining, etc.\n\n- Do the additives bother you at all?\n- What is your favorite pizza related movie?\n- Does delivery and the hussle inspire you in any way? Do you gain ideas while delivering for your own business ideas?\n- My local Round Table pisses me off. They have coupons, but if I pull it up on their website they tell me I need to print it out. Why have it on the website then?\n- Some of the chains I notice now charge a delivery fee. Do you drivers get any of that?\n- I dont usually order a lot of pizza... Usually my order amounts to $10-$20. What tip amount would you like and consider reasonable?\n- Has anyone ever tipped you \"look both ways...\" before?\n- Where are all the reports of women stripping for their delivery drivers? The pot tips are clever... but...  how about the women customers? I mean, its gotta happen... right??? Not too many stories involving women.\n\nOkay. Some dumb questions but hey...

        "text": "This took place about two months ago.\n\nOn this particular night, things were going *okay*. Nothing went particularly well nor did anything go terribly, except for some customer. \n\nI pick up the delivery, and look at the address. The customer lives on the poorer side of town, so I\"m already prepared for \"The Ol' Sign 'N Dine\" (where a customer looks at the credit card receipt, ignores the tip area, and just signs for his/her food). No biggie.\n\n I pull up to the house, which is quite run down. I hear the customer and his friend talking through a broken window about how they're going to try to get free food from us for one reason or another, and then I knock. The customer, a wiry, disheveled man, proceeds to gloat that, had I been only a couple of minutes later on the delivery, he would have received his food for free. Yes, you read that correctly. I politely tell him that we do not, nor have we ever had that policy regarding delivery times and free food, accept his signature, and make the delivery. \n\nAs I enter the store, I hear my shift leader on the phone with a customer, someone who is extremely angry. It turns out that a certain customer (yes, the very same) was very displeased to find that he could only \"fit about an inch of his bread stick into the sauce cup at a time\". This customer demanded free food, cussed out my manager, and was altogether rude, not surprising given his demeanor during my delivery. \n\nTwo minutes later, I'm on my way back to his house, with three cups of marinara sauce in tow (my manager wasn't about to let him get away with free food, especially after I informed him of what I had overheard). I knock on the front door, and the man opens the door angrily, shouting at me before I can say anything. He gets within inches of my face and screams obscenities about how terrible my service is, what a douche my manager is, etc. I'm not easily angered by any means, but you can imagine what might be boiling over at this point. The spit on my face isn't helping, nor is his finger on my chest.\n\nI clear my throat. \"Sir?\"\n\n\"WHAT!?\"\n\n\"Calm down. Now.\" \n\nI look him in the eye, hand him his (3) cups of marinara. He backs off, sizes me up, does the math, and runs inside. \n\nThat's probably the worst personal experience I've had with a customer so far in terms of maintaining my professionalism, but we haven't had an order from him since.\n\nEdit: Couple of clarifications, since people are asking about my manager, blocking customers, etc. That night, we had a shift lead working, instead of the RGM or his assistant manager. Shift leads *typically* bend over backwards for customers on the spot, report incidents above their pay grade to the actual managers in staff to avoid liability. Not saying I would have put up with that behavior if it were me, but there you go. Our RGM blocked the customer following the incident. ",

When I get back to the shop, I slip on the wet floor, and my glasses catch on the door just the right way, breaking them.\n\nFuck.\n\nI explain what happened to my manager, drive home and get my spares. I get back to the store, thankfully don't break my *other* glasses that I just went to get. And get straight to manning the ovens. And then I drop the second pizza I touch. The guy who's pizza I dropped is in the lobby, and starts yelling at us about how we're all incompetent people who will work minimum wage forever.\n\nOn my next run, I go to our local crazy schitzoprenic lady. She's going on and on about how crazy the rain is (as I'm standing in it) and then tells me to make sure I take off my watch so lightning won't strike me. Alright, just do what the crazy lady says. Then she takes my wrist, leads me off to my car and wants to make sure I leave safely, so she goes to stand in the street to stop traffic. I try telling her to get out of the road, but she says \"no, I'm helping you get out of here\". Alright, do what the crazy lady says.\n\nThe run after that is a $65 prefer to a hotel. I'm thinking \"if you have $65 to spend on overpriced pizza, *surely* you have $5 for a tip.\" Nope. A stiff. He leaves the total blank, do I ask him to fill it in, so he leaves a nice little zero for the tip, and $65 for the total. Now I'm pretty pissed off. I'm walking down the hall, and I say to myself, but loudly enough that he can hear me \"hey, *that'll* pay the rent this month!\" I'm not aggressive, but I'll do my passive aggressive best to make you feel like shit.\n\nAn hour and a few deliveries later, I go on one where they ordered a 2 liter of coke. I get there, we talk about the rain, and I set the coke down on the wall. Just as I'm leaving, I lightly brush it with the pizza bag, it falls and it bursts, *soaking* one of the Gus in soda. Thank god they were good sports about it, one guy saying \"haha, dude, if that was a frag grenade, you'd be dead!\" I apologised over and over, felt more like shit than ever, and offers to go get them another. They were cool, said something along the lines of \" it's just an excuse to break out another six pack\". As I was leaving, I stalled my car right in front of them, and could hear someone say, \" wow. Poor guy. Looks like he's having a rough night.\" Yes, yes I am. I'lol just try not to Fuck everything up tomorrow.\n\nTL;DR Git pulled over, broke my glasses, dealt with a crazy lady, stiffed on a big order and soaked a guy in soda, all in the same night.",

        "text": "Okay, so I've been lurking a bit, reading and learning from you veterans.  A little about me (since it's my first post), I'm 33 and just got out of the Air Force with 15 years of service.  I'm doing this to help pay for college and help with the bills around the house.  Now the, yesterday was my first day/night to drive by myself, a Friday night with high school football games going on and first day of the long weekend... go big or go home, right?!  LoL\nSo, I got my a little clip board and an orange highlighter to mark up my credit card tickets, i wear my hat up so people can see my face really well (poor bastards.. hhaha), have a super bright flashlight, and all that.  I'm SUPER stoked to get out on my own and do my thing (besides, I'm tired of cleaning things in the store... the \"right of passage\" in my Pizza Hut store [how many times a day does a wing fryer need to be cleaned??])!!  I walk in the store 10 minutes early and the phones are ringing off the hook and everyone is running around like it's the end of the world.  There's already a bunch of deliveries up and ready and apparently three people walked out and quite yesterday...  I grab the first order and head out the door.  First delivery is 18 minutes away (we have a HUGE area of responsibility) which I don't mind, I love to drive (which is why I took this job).  I get there and try to be as professional as possible, the lady compliments me on my clipboard and courteousness (I called to let her know I was on the way and that I was going to be more than 15 minutes).  I got a $10 tip!!!!!  Took everything I had not to act like an over excited puppy and wet myself or hump her leg or something.  lol  Soon as I get back to the store i have a double delivery to take out, now I'm full tilt into this.  First house, nothing special.  Leaving there I call the second part to let them know I'm on the way and they thank me for the heads up.  I get there and this smoking hot girl in a bikini rushes out to meet me at my car, claiming she's super stoked and hungry for pizza.  She reeks of weed and alcohol, and decided that it was a great idea to give me a hug just for delivering pizza!  whatevs, I'll take it!  \nLittle later I get to a house and they compliment my clipboard and overall professionalism and give me a $5 tip.  By the time I get back to the store, their order was wrong (now I know NOT to trust the cutter and the manager to make sure the order was correct, but to check myself too).  So, I grab the corrected order and head back.  I start apologizing profusely and take the blame... because I didn't know what to expect, she laughs and said \"no big deal, it happens\" then gives me another tip!?  It was only $2 but I was surely confused about getting a tip..  All this was in the first hour of work!  The rest of the shift was fairly uneventful, except the one guy who had two nephews who were delivery guys and went on a rant about how delivery guys don't get paid \"f**k all\" and gave me a $6 tip and wished me safe travels.\nAll in all I had a REALLY great night!  I can see why you guys love doing this, and I'm really excited for tonight, even though I don't expect anything like last night.  I did manage to pull in $83.76 in tips and mileage.  I also drove 103+ miles in a 5 to 9 shift, so that's not to bad, especially at 32 cent a mile.\n\ntl;dr had a GREAT first night of work and I owe it all to the lessons learned here.  hats off and bags open to you guys!\n\nSafe drivings this weekend guys!!",

But today is the one that pissed me off, I live in FL so that hurricane has been over so obviously it's been raining like cats and dogs. I get this order that's about 15 min from the store drive all the way out there and see they don't have a roof above the doorway, so I called the customer and to let her know I'm there so she can come to the door and possibly let me stand inside. Nope she stands in the doorway while I'm getting roof water dropped in me and rain so I'm just getting soaked. She signs the card and reaches for the bag in which I pull the bag away cause she can't just take it. I start taking the pizzas out while still standing in the rain and she starts yelling \"I don't want those pizzas now you're getting them all wet!!\" My reply was \"Mam I sorry but where would you like me to stand? I'm out here getting soaked while you're in the doorway what would you like me to do?\" She didn't respond, didn't tip me either so now that if I ever get that lady again she will get her pizza last. \n\n",

So, basically, he goes to class all day then delivers at night until about midnight. Needless to say, he's been very tired lately, and very fed up with people's BS. \n\n\nToday he called me after a delivery. He said he just got done delivering a fifty dollar order to a neighborhood that was on the outskirts of his delivery radius... A good fifteen minute drive from the store. Today has been pretty lousy tip wise for him, so he was crossing his fingers hoping to make something decent off of this order. After all, it was the richer area of our town. \n\n\nHe goes to the door, pizza in hand. An older woman answers, and remarks on how he is ten minutes earlier than she anticipated, and that was really great because her family was starving. *Awesome*, he thinks, *That's a pretty good sign*. The total was like, 49.99, and she hands him a fifty dollar bill. \n\n\nAnd that's it. He hands her the pizza, she smiles and thanks him, then shuts the door. He said he was disappointed, but with the way today has been, it's no shock to him at all. He turns to leave, and as he starts his car, he hears her yelling at him. \n\n\n\"Waiiit!! Hold up a second!!!\"\n\n\nNow, for one golden moment, my boyfriend's hope in this woman had been restored. He thought maybe in her haze of hunger, she had merely forgotten to give him a tip and had come back to remedy that. But... No. Instead she leaned into the car, her good mood gone. \n\n\n\"Excuse me, but you forgot to give me my *penny*.\"\n\n\nMy boyfriend said he smiled and handed a penny that was sitting in his car cup holder, then wished her a good evening. She snatched it out of his hand without a word, then huffed off back to the house. Unbelievable. \n\n\nI have no idea how you guys deal with some of the people that are rude like that woman. I'll be sure to give him extra cuddles tonight after dealing with a witch like her. My hat's off to you guys, for real. ",

        "text": "It seems like a lot of the going assumption from people who browse and sometimes reply here, but are not delivery workers themselves, is that delivery drivers don't actually do anything other than that. In other words, when it comes to opinions on how to tip and what the perception of the job is, the *only* consideration made is how fast/how pleasant the driver is themselves rather than considering all the other work done to ensure you get good food, in a reasonable amount of time, to your door step.\n\nWhere I work (and I have to imagine it's the same or similar with most everyone else in the large chain I work at...so a good chunk of the industry itself), delivery drivers are also kitchen cleaners, food preppers, order takers, at the cut table and also making food themselves. When you argue that drivers aren't like servers, that's completely wrong. The servers I knew were expected to help out with back-of-house things, as well, in addition to coordinating orders and serving you your food, and helping you with your night. When you tip a server, that all should be in consideration (and I hope it is -- if it isn't, you need to change how you think about tipping.) It's the same here, as well, with delivery drivers.\n\nI mean, that's not counting having to navigate rush-hour traffic, or carrying the food in and out of bad weather, in order to get your food to you as quickly as we can, in addition to probably having other orders that may be on the other side of the delivery area. It's all a balance.\n\nI'm not interested in kicking off another debate over the merits of tipping, since that's apparently a subject that customers take very personally... which is odd, but it is what it is. I'd just hope that when customers order a pizza, they take this all into account rather than thinking inside their own local circumstance, in the immediate moment. In other words, the process for you was to pick up your phone and go onto your computer, place an order and wait in the proscribed window of time before your food just shows up at your door. There's a lot more that happens on our end than just the driver sitting there waiting for the order and driving to your house.",

The phone number / caller ID is a little odd, and when I ask for the guy's name I couldn't quite understand what he said and ask him to repeat that. 90% sure it's different than what he said the first time, but whatever.\n\nI end up being the lucky one to take the delivery.\n\nGet out to the very edge of our delivery area to this low-income subdivision. There are plenty of nice people who live out there, but it's one of the few places we delivered to where I never felt quite safe. \n\nThe driveway is full of vehicles, so I park on the street in front of their driveway, essentially blocking in their cars. Go to the door, knock, wait, knock, wait, finally a woman opens the door. She says they didn't order any pizza, so... great. Wrong address I guess; I was having problems hearing the guy.\n\nSo I go back out to my car and call the number that ordered as per company policy. No answer. Call again, no answer. Call my manager, who says he'll call the number and call me back with either the right address or permission to come back to the store. The woman comes out of her house to put something in a car, asks if I'm having any issues, I say no and explain what I'm doing. I ask if it's okay to chill there for a second and she says sure. I'm waiting for my manager to call back, decide to move forward in case this lady needs to get out of her driveway, when police sirens go off, lights flying around the corner onto the street. My manager calls back just as I'm nope-ing the hell out of there.\n\nHalfway back to the store, manager calls, tells me to go back to the address and explains the situation.\n\nThe DEA was working with the local police to get a drug dealer. The DEA told the locals to call in a pizza to be delivered to an officer at a nearby gas station, locals fuck up and deliver it to the actual address instead. Lucky me. And now they want me to come all the way back out to the edge of our delivery area to give them the pizza in front of the arrested drug dealer and his girl friend.\n\nI get there, they give me $40 for a $35 order like it's a giant tip that I should be super thankful for. I ask for the guy's badge number and department for my manger to file an internal report and he tells me and laughs about me being their test gerbil (his exact words).\n\nA few days later my franchise owner and I go to the DEA's temporary regional office because the owner, my manager, and I are obviously pissed. They explain the mistake, promise to write a letter saying we had nothing to do with the event, send us on our way with a bunch of BS, and never contact any of us again. I still have the DEA agent's card in my wallet.\n\nThe conversation repeatedly revolved around:\n\nHe was the safest delivery driver in the city that night! He had a dozen agents ten feet away!\n\nHow would that help if they answered the door with a gun?\n\nIt wouldn't, but he was safe.\n\nWould you send your men to the door without a bulletproof vest?\n\nWell of course not.\n\nSo he wasn't safe?\n\nHe was the safest driver in the city!\n \nIt was total bullshit and it still makes me angry just to type this out.",

But I feel like this story fits pretty well here\n\n\nTL;DR: Running out of a brand new dessert item is apparently equivalent to smacking someone's newborn child\n\n\nSo, as some of you may know, the latest period promotion for Papa John's is this new dessert called cinnamon pull aparts. They're pretty tasty, and they're new. So of course they've been selling pretty well. We had about 60 in the store to last us a week, and had 2 more cases of them coming in on the commissary order for the night. But of course, we're down to 3 the night before. I make sure to let the opening manager know and figure the GM or she will get a few extra just in case we run out before the truck comes. \n\nOf course we run out. Why would we not after all?\n\nUnfortunately, as we ran out, another order got placed over the phone and we wouldn't have any to make them. \n\nAt this point, it's the middle of our dinner rush, and the commissary is like an hour late. I unfortunately don't have time to call the person who ordered to tell them we're out since I didn't have anyone to catch oven and pizzas were going late at this point. \n\nSo after 15 minutes, I have a break and go to call the customer and apologize and offer something else. \n\nBut of course, the second I pull up the order to get the phone number, the customer walks in. \n\nHe doesn't look particularly grumpy, but after I greet him and ask how he's doing, he just says his name, sounds pretty cranky. \n\nSo at this point I tell him I'm incredibly sorry, but we are out of cinnamon pull aparts, it's been an incredibly popular item, and we made a mistake in not ordering more. I offer him a free dessert or other side, or a credit to get a free cinnamon thing later on. I was very sincere and nice and polite and with other customers, this approach has always worked, they've been slightly annoyed or disappointed, but nobody was ever really angry. \n\nHowever, apparently this cinnamon pull apart was the most important thing in the world to this man. He gets incredibly mad at an impressive rate. \n\nHe tells me to \"cancel the whole fucking order\" \n\"This is completely unacceptable you should have fucking called me\"\n\nHe then storms off as if he's about to leave, cursing loudly the whole time \n\nThings such as \"this is fucking bullshit\" \"I should have just ordered from fucking Domino's\" \n\nHowever, our friend wasn't finished yet. He storms back over, looking like I just pissed all over his newborn daughter, and demands the phone number of my regional manager. \n\nAt this point, I made an error in judgement and gave him the number. I should have just given him the number of my GM. But I was pretty pissed at this point, and just gave it to him. He then asked for my name, which I gave to him. \n\nHe then walks away, looking back at me, making sure to tell me that the regional manager will be hearing from him, and he'll be telling him my name, and I say \"Please go ahead and do that sir, my last day is in 2 days anyway\" making sure to keep my fake cheery voice the entire time. I probably shouldn't have said that last part, but the man managed to do the impossible, and completely piss me off. \n\nI've always been excellent with customers, managing to work out a complaint quickly, and satisfying them and making sure they return as a customer. Any complaint ended up satisfied and either happy or less upset than they were earlier after talking to me. \n\nBut not King Cinnamon Man. \n\nOh no. I personally offended him and his entire lineage with my failure to provide him with a cinnamon pull apart. \n\nSo yeah. That was a really interesting interaction with a very salty man I had today. \n\nI know I should have called this customer and let them know, but I did so as soon as I possible could have, and tried to compensate for the inconvenience. I can only do so much with one insider and a full oven and full screen of pizzas. \n\nHave you guys ever had customers like that before? \n\n",

But there's one thing I haven't been able to explain to him properly and I was hoping you all would be able to help. \n\nAt the end of our shift, we give our CC slips to the manager and they input the tips and such, then the driver either owes money or gets money, depending on how many cash orders they take. \n\nI tried to explain it like his pocket and drop box are like the till in the cash register. He takes the payment for the orders and turns it in at the end of the night. Tips from credit card orders are given to him in cash, so this is the info that goes into determining that amount at the end of the shift. It's still not sticking.\n\nAny suggestions? \n\n",

        "text": "So, I used to deliver for a place over the Summer for about a month a few years ago and now I'm delivering again in a new area soon. So here's the deal:\n\n1. at my old place since I was working mainly with friends, I never really learned how to take orders or learn how to clock in because they said some of the software was outdated or something and was difficult for new drivers with the menu of the time so they did it for me. At my new place, I'm going to be solo with no friends or anyone I know and I'm worried that I'll mess up an order or not clock in right or something. When I go in for the interview, should I bring this up subtly somehow? Play around with it during down time? Wing it from my little knowledge of before?\n\n2. GPS vs Map. My first place had the largest radius in the county and I always used GPS for the whole month even though it got me lost to new developments and had me take long ways. However, since then I'm thinking GPS units got way more advanced and also I'll be delivering in a smaller area (4-5 miles out most of the time). Should I rely on a new GPS system or learn with the map?\n\n3. Do delivery drivers tend to have to clean up bathrooms at all for chain places or do they get a guy for that?\n\nThanks in advance. Although I'm sort of a faux-noob at delivering I'm kind of excited about it again.",

I tell the boss today so I can get paid for my 150 miles, and it basically goes like this:\n\n\nBoss: No way did you do that many. Nobody does 85 miles in 5 hours.\n\nAli: Well I did.\n\nBoss: That's too far in one night.\n\nAli: We were busy and I worked an extra hour. *gets out phone calculator* That's only 17 miles an hour, what's wrong with that?\n\nBoss: Sorry no, and 65 miles is too much for a Sunday too.\n\nAli: Again, we were busy and I stayed on later.\n\nBoss: I'm not paying you for 85 miles, you can't have done that. You can have 45 for each day, 90 overall.\n\nAli: Well if you're not gonna pay me then I'm not gonna work here anymore.\n\nBoss: Fine.\n\n\nThey pay 25p per mile and he cheated me out of 60 miles worth, so £15. Not exactly a lot, but if it happens once it will happen again. I work(ed) at two shops, the other one pays £1 per delivery which is generally the standard rate. I guess I'll ask for more hours there.\n\n\nTLDR: Agreed to get paid by the mile, boss decided that I didn't do as many as I claimed, paid me less, so I walked.",

It was a normal Sunday afternoon morning shift, deliveries were coming in steadily and one came in online for a neighborhood a few miles away. Nothing weird about the order, two pep sausage pizzas under the Domino's $5.99 mix and match deal. I show up to the house and there are no cars in the driveway.  No big deal, I give the phone number I was given a ring and the lady that answered was nice enough sounding. When I told her that I was from Domino's checking to see if anyone was home she quickly changed her tone. She instantly got shitty and asked if I had seen the note on her door. I said no and apologised and she explained what had gotten her so upset. Apparently for the last 3 YEARS someone had been cycling through the 5 different pizza places that deliver to her house and once or twice a week these people get a delivery that they did not order. I apologised up and down for bothering her and went back to the store and let my manager know. He has been working at the store for10+ years and recognized the address. He told me a teacher used to live there and the deliveries started 6 years ago and every few months the evildoer cycles back to us and sends them deliveries from us every few days. Apparently the teacher moved a few years ago and the evildoer did not find about it, so this innocent family has been botheredby pizza guys for the past 3 years.\n\nPicture of the sign on the door which I thought was hilarious. http://imgur.com/BZGCLOo",

I get to his house and start knocking/ringing the bell and wait a while since I know it usually takes him some time to get to the door. A few minutes later I hear him yell \"Coming!\", to which I respond \"Okay\". Another 30 seconds go by and I hear him yell \"Coming!\" again, to which I respond \"No problem take your time\". Well this goes on about 10 more times before I start getting confused. Since he's a really good regular, I try the knob and the door opens. With the door cracked, I can hear what he's really been saying the whole time, \"Come in\". I get in and walk to the living room where this man is full on spread out on the floor with his walker half way across the room. Turns out he fell while trying to use his walker to help him off the couch. So for the next 10 minutes, I devise a plan to get him up. Once we roll him to and onto the couch, I get him up (not easy at all; guy is 350+), he tips me $3 and a big thank you. Told me he doesn't know what he would have done if someone wasn't there. Apparently that's worth $3. \n\nTl;dr: Obese regular falls while getting up, yells to come in for 10 minutes, I save his life, he tips me $3",

He hangs up and sure enough is in here within about ten minutes looking shaky and he had a picture of his previous order (which we don't accept screenshots as the image could be old or edited) and I told him I would need to see the actual previous order not a screen shot. \nHim: \"It says it's there why didn't I get my soda?!?\" (He ordered a special for a large pizza a side and a 2liter for 15$ which would have made the delivery total 19 and some change). \nMe: \"It looks like you didn't put the soda in there on that order to get the special sir\"\nHim: \"I got the special!\" (At this point his eyes are watering up and his voice is starting to crack some)\nMe: \"No you didn't sir if you had it would have been 19 and some change. You are more than welcome to take a free soda\" (my boss happens to walk in off shift at this point to give something to another employee and already knows that this is here for as I texted him about it before the guy arrived).\nHim: \"I don't even want the soda now.

Because of this normally it is pretty limited to only the town you are in in what can be delivered. (Normally just pizza places which delivery in most of the towns. But in the bigger one a few asian stores deliver and bars. Hell Asian food in general is only found in the bigger one) \n\nSo I have been wondering, why is it that companies limit the delivery radius to such a small area? I mean..., I know myself I wouldn't mind having to pay 10-15+ dollars in delivery fee to get food delivered from 20-30 minutes away as some days I am just craving a specific food not available where I am but is available the next town over.\n\n\nDoes any drivers have any insight into this?",

This time was no different. \n\nWhen I arrive to the house and a mid 20s guy opens the door, I look in and notice there are a ton of 40-something aged drunk dudes dancing behind the customer. Some of them are twerking, others are dancing on the counter and then there was this one guy doing this odd dance STARING me right into my soul. I couldn't help but crack up. From inside the house I hear one of the guys scream, \"tell him I want to suck his dick!!!\" \n\nI couldn't help but laugh even harder and the customer I was dealing with laughed back and said, \"sorry dude we are having a golf get-away weekend.\" \n\nAfter he paid and closed the door I couldn't help but laugh to myself in confusion and awe. I got a nice tip though. ",

        "text": "Longtime lurker, have a bunch of stories of shitty people from my two years as a driver thus far. Most of them are just dickwad customers, but. Well. Some people just take the cake.\n\nThere's a threshold when playing a prank on the pizza guy you don't cross- and that is when they don't realize it's just, in fact, a prank and may pose a major threat to us. Loudly yelling about the big dog getting loose and letting it slip past you in the doorway is a surefire way to have to go to the vet for a dog’s injured jaw or worse.\n\n*TL;DR for lazy readers is that a delivery driver’s highest priority is their safety, and if you interfere or threaten that then you may get hurt- if you let your DOG interfere, it may get hurt.*\n\nSo, this is actually two stories in one along with a constant pain in the ass from shitty pet owners. One was probably six months after I started (18 months ago), the other was last month. I'm not proud of either one, the former at least I laugh a little about.\n\nThe first one was about six months into my time as a driver- I was starting to be a bit less high-strung, a bit more relaxed. Of course, someone has to piss in your Cheerios. I was on my 8th delivery of a particularly bad night to one of the dozen apartment complexes here- it wasn't a particularly bad one, it was just. Average in every way.\n\nNow, my Spidey-sense is a bit oversensitive, I admit it- sometimes it flares up for no good reason, but sometimes I should listen to it. Someone approached me after I gave the customer the pizza, before I could get to my car and into it. Kinda dark skin, about 5’7”, tweaker. Asked if he could get the money I just got for that order, and reached for his waistband really carefully- there’s “adjustment” reaching then there’s “drawing something from it” reaching.\n\nHe did the latter and I distinctly remember having the moment. You know the one. That split-second where time flat-out STOPS and you can think clearly, just for a moment. Anyway, I realized if I turned my back on him I was screwed.\n\nI’m not proud of this, but I may or may not have punched him in the face with one arm while my other hand was around his neck until I could safely throw him in the apartment dumpster. I just wanted out of there, and there was no safe method to get out other than to deal with the threat since I had no idea what he was gonna do. If it was “hey I was just playin’, you want some weed?”, if it was a knife or a gun. \n\nDon’t know, don’t care. I do feel bad because I know I hurt him, but it was 11 at night on a weekday. Nobody was awake to see it. I got out of there unscathed, got back to the store and clocked out for the night.\n\nI bought a Leatherman (basically a 12oz. piece of steel with a 3” knife blade in it) the day after that, and my CCW permit is in the mail.\n\nSecond incident was a couple weeks ago, when I got up to the address there was the woman at the door, and there were two guys on the balcony, one of whom was starting to loudly ask about if I had a lot of money on me- I told him the truth- “No, everyone pays with credit cards around here so all you’d get for your efforts is wasted energy.” Which resulted in him and his friend rather loudly joking about “He’s prolly loaded man, we could just get ‘im right now.”\n\nOf course, this was followed by lots of “We’re just kidding man, we wouldn’t hurt you guys” as soon as the woman at the door came back- the wife of one of those two.\nI got out of there as fast as I could.\n\nNow for that constant problem I deal with:\n\n**Control your fucking dogs.** Maybe it’s a SoCal problem. But fuck off with your goddamn rats you let run out, bark, tug at my pants- I actually wear extremely heavy pants at work in 100-degree weather because of your shitty dogs.\n\nIn the last three months, I’ve had eight different people let their dogs run around and jump and bark and snap at my feet/legs… It’s hugely annoying and kinda painful, even if the teeth don’t penetrate. Don’t call the store and complain “Blake threatened our dog! He almost stomped on it!” when there’s goddamn TOOTH MARKS IN MY JEANS. \n\n“B-but it’s just a Chihuahua!” I don’t give a shit, I will send that rat into low orbit if it gets through my pants. It hurts me, I hurt it. It doesn’t hurt me, I don’t hurt it. End of story. On the upside, the rat-sized dogs typically fuck off if I stomp on the porch hard enough though. So that’s nice.\n\nIf you have a big dog and you let it run at me, and it’s clear it’s wanting to bite (there’s a difference in gait between happy and angry dogs) well. Mostly all my coworkers share the same attitude. I will cock back and kick your ‘precious babby who wouldn’t hurt nowbowdy’ straight in its teeth if it’s barking and snarling at me, and it lunges. I will kick it as hard as I can, and if you end up with $3K in vet bills because you couldn’t keep your mutt wrangled then fuck off.\n\n**BEING IN CUSTOMER SERVICE DOES NOT WAIVE THE EMPLOYEE’S RIGHT TO SELF DEFENSE.**",

        "text": "Hello, long time lurker, first time poster here.\n\nI'm a delivery guy for Thai food in a small town. And as you might notice, every Asian restaurant (sometimes including Thai food) make foods damn fast. I'm talking 2 minutes for couple dishes of food. If it's not busy. \n\nIt's not unusual that I always ended up at customers house in 15 minute after they hung up the phone (we have 5 miles delivery radius), and just to make sure that we are not late for the delivery, the servers always tell customer on phone that it might take 30-45 minutes to deliver and I arrive there really early.\n\nWe can't really control the delivery time because I'm the only driver in the restaurant so we always says 45 minutes. (Once I had to haul 7 giant plastic bags of food which total costs like half a thousand dollars in a small car, and that really sucks. Turning car too fast and I'll ruin the food).\n\nAnyways back to the story. Lately I just noticed something about arriving at customers house early. More than half of the people that says \"wow you come here so fast\" always tip only $2-$3, mostly $3. I mean I'm not trying to complain that I get $3 per delivery, but come on, it's a $70 worth of food that arrives your home in 15 minutes.\n\nGetting complimentary for a fast delivery makes me happy. But 5% tips always make me crying inside. I once broke my own records by delivering food to customers house in 6 minutes,  and was told by the customer that I was the fastest delivery man ever, your food is the best in town, they really appreciate fast delivery blah blah blah. And left me with $2 :(\n\nAgain, I'm not complaining here that i get little tip, after I read on this sub I just realized that a lot of pizza folks get stiffed a lot more frequent than I did. But giving me a false hope of good tips makes me sad.\n\nOkay I think I kinda lie, I sort of complain a bit. \n\nTLDR: took 6 minutes to deliver food, was told I'm the best delivery guy, tips me 5%.\n\nGuys, I'm sorry I don't know how to wrap up the post. I'm still learning language. I think I should just end my post right here haha.\n\nEDIT: OMG THANKS FOR THE GOLD! LOVE YOU ALL &lt;3",

Well, what she failed to realize is that this CSR had told her he could not work Tuesdays due to school.. and so the fun begins..\n\nWe had no one to handle the front, all we had as a crew was Production (1 member), a Manager working cut table (only joined 2 weeks ago), and 2 delivery drivers (me being one of them) and we were out on delivery the entire night, so essentially, we only had 2 people actually running the store for the most part.\n\nToday, is the only day in 3 years that i've been working at Pizzahut, where the manager declared we would not take any Dine ins. I want to say about 85% of calls were ignored because we simply didn't have enough people to run the store efficiently.\n\nI was on a Quad run, and one of the ladies that ordered decided to bitch about her food, saying \"Let me check to see if it's cold,\" clearly it was not, I could feel the heat coming from the box, and I told her \"I promise you it's not cold\" yet all she could think to say was \"Well it's not hot either, so i'm calling the store about it\"\n\nI explained our situation and told her not to waste her time, She said she would get through eventually (Completely ignoring what I said). I laughed a little on the inside, I hope she spent the next 3 hours trying to get through, she never got through.\n\nSurprisingly, we at least managed not to burn the place down, nor have anyone want to crucify us, which is good I guess, but damn, what a night..

I've only ever worked at Dominos, so I'm not too sure if other pizza companies do it differently and had a few questions. \n\nBasically how has your experience been, and is working for Papa Johns different? Do they give good hours for drivers, and is it a good working enviroment? Any weird rules? Do people tend to tip better since the price and quality tends to be higher?\n\nAlso how the hell do I apply? The online site doesn't even list my state, and the separate franchise hiring site doesn't have any locations listed which I guess means they're not hiring, but I'd still like to get an application in and introduce myself to the manager or something.

Nights are usually a lot more lucrative as far as tips go, but theres lots of insiders. When I open its only me and my manager until about 4pm. On my opening days, I will give the manager a couple bucks if:\n\n1) I go out on a big order (6+ pizzas) AND get 10+ dollars. So if i get 10 on a big order ill give her maybe 3 bucks... 5 if i have been having a super awesome day so far\n\n2) I go out on a SMALL order BUT the customer is so nice they give me ridiculous tip like 15+... ill go back and give my manager a couple bucks. why? because im definitely happy with 10 for a small order. \n\n3) Loyal customer orders 16-piece wings, but has special request: DRUMSTICKS only. She orders every monday and tips 10 every time. I give my manager 5. why? Because if i dont give customer drumsticks only, i dont get 10. and if im giving her drumsticks only, im kinda manipulating our inventory which can be a conflict of interest with the manager.. so i give the manager a piece of that tip\n\nNow at night time, theres a bunch of cooks and insiders, not just one. On these nights, I RARELY tip anyone. Because i feel like if i tip one insider i might as well tip them all so no hard feelings are caught. And if i were to do that i'd be paying out too much and it would defeat the purpose of me having my job with tips!\n\nSo with that being said, what criteria has to be met in order for you to tip your non-driving co-workers?\n\nI know a lot of you don't tip at all. I don't blame you especially if your area sucks and you struggle to make good with tips. But do any of you make really good tips and still dont tip anyone in the store? Sometimes I have horrible days with tips and i feel bad that im not able to tip my manager, even though i went out on a bunch of deliveries that day (but got stiffed or low-tipped a lot.) Especially after he dispatches me so much throughout the day. He doesnt know whether im getting stiffed or not.. unless its credit card tips of course... and coming back with 5's on my credit card all day makes me feel like a horrible person when i dont tip my manager anything by the end of the day. do i need to stop being so thoughtful toward my co workers? haha",

Why were you paging [Customer]? He went home. I've been here the whole time waiting for my food!\"\n\nHoping that they were willing to explain this situation after I was far far away, I finally got her to finish signing the CC/Delivery slip. \n\nCN- \"Can I have this (the signed slip)?

        "text": "I work for a place that's had the same owners for almost 30 years. They make damn good pizza and rarely listen to complaints because the vast majority of their customers enjoy their pizza. Most complaints are from assholes wanting free food. If a customer can show that we screwed up, we honor it, but if he simply says, \"your food sucks,\" we tell him to screw off. If you don't like it,  don't order anymore. \n\nSo when a call came in saying that they didn't get pepperoni on their extra cheese and pepperoni pizza the owner got irritated. The owner made it herself and swore that she put it on. What irritated her further was that the customer had eaten half the pizza and wanted his money back. My boss said, \"no,  you ate half so I don't see why you should get your money back.\" \n\nHe replied with, \"I didn't get what I ordered. There was no pepperoni!\"\n\nSo my boss said, \"fine. Bring me the pizza. Show me that there is no pepperoni and I'll refund you your money.\"\n\nHe shows up, slams the box on the counter, opens it and yells,  \"where is the pepperoni?\"\n\nMy boss lifts the cheese and shows him every single slice of pepperoni that she had put on when making it. Because it was extra cheese, all the cheese covered up the pepperoni.\n\nThe guy simply says, \"okay, bye,\" and walks out, leaving his pizza.",

        "text": "So you all enjoyed my last post so I figured I'd post another story along these lines. I'm gonna try to end it with a lesson like I did last time so that new drivers can learn.\n\nOn my 3rd night (literally the third night I have ever delivered) delivering pizzas I had a nice old lady pay me with rolls of quarters and a few bills. She even tipped me pretty well (~$4 on a $20 order). So at the end of the night I'm doing my cash out and one of my managers needs coins so he has me break open one of the rolls of quarters she gave me. Turns out it was two quarters on either end filled with pennies and sand in between. For both rolls of quarters. My bosses were very understanding (they even let me keep the tip) they just told me to count the money for every order in the future. Which I do. Zealously.\n\nSo a year or so later I am much more experienced and have a (more or less) license from my GM to do whatever I need to do to fulfill customer satisfaction/ensure the order gets delivered. I had also learned about a neat niche in our states law. Which sets the stage for this delivery:\n\nThis particular customer lived at an apartment complex very close to our store. However it had a slight reputation for being kind of rough. Anyway....\n\nI arrived at the complex around 10:30PM and can immediately hear music from a party going on from about two blocks away. \"Man,\" I thought, \"I really hope I'm not going there.\" Of course dear reader, you know exactly where I was going.\n\nSo I snake around the complex and sure enough, my destination is this raucous house party. I sigh. Gather my wits and the order, and head upstairs. \n\nI knocked on the door. No answer. Waited about a minute. Checked my slip. Knocked again. Waited about another minute. I started banging on the door. \n\nAbout 10 seconds later a very large man opens the door and yells \"THE FUCK YOU WANT?\"\n\nAs he opened the door I noticed two things: \n1- Everyone is wearing very very similar colors and most of them have a bandanna or strip of cloth tied on them somewhere.\n2- The very strong smell of weed, stale beer, flavored vodka, and cheap cologne.\n\nI am clearly at a party for one of the local gangs.\n\nShit.\n\nMe: Man I just want to deliver this order.\n\nBig Dude (BD): Whose is it?\n\nMe: Ummm......$Customer?\n\nBD: Hang on.\n\nMe: * Waits for a bit until the door opens*\n\n$Customer ($C): Yo man you got my pizza.\n\nMe: Yes sir. Your total is going to be $19.50\n\n$C: OK. Here.\n\n$C: * hands me a literal solo cup with change in it *\n\nMe: Alright sir. Let me count this out and make sure it's enough.\n\nI kneeled down and starting counting out this mass of change.\n\n$C: What man? You don't trust me?\n\nMe: No sir. If this is over I just want to make sure you get your correct change back. If it's short I don't want it to come out of my tips at the end of the night.\n\n$C: It ain't short.\n\nMe: * As I'm counting his change* I'm sure it's not sir but I want to make sure.\n\nThis cup is mostly full of pennies and as I'm counting them out it's becoming clear that this is not enough for the order. I'm 99% sure this guy knew this when he gave me the cup.\n\n$C: Man it's all fuckin there gimme my pizza.\n\nMe: Sir I'm happy to give you the food and count this back at the store. However there is something you should know...\n\n$C: What?\n\nMe: *puts on poker face* If I head back to the store and it's short, it's no longer a small misunderstanding it's considered theft of service.\n\n$C: The fuck does that mean?\n\nMe: It means that it's not me whose gonna come back and get the money. It'll be the cops.\n\n$C: Uh..........Yo man gimme a minute.\n\nHe went inside and was in there for about a minute. He came out and shoved a five in my face and told me to keep the change. \n\nTurns out he was only short in change by about $2 so I roughly got $3 and some change for a tip.\n\nLesson: this lesson has two parts-\n\nLesson 1- Do not attempt to do what I did. I've worked with and have been friends with former gang members. I know how to talk to them, recognize colors, and generally can handle myself when It comes to them. Ideally I don't interact with gang members ever, but this knowledge has saved me from a shitty time once or twice.\n\nLesson 2-Count all money before you hand over that pizza. I once had a guy hand me a roll of ones to cover a ~$120 order. I counted it in front of him and he was actually very apologetic when it came up short. The customer may believe that they've handed you the right amount of money but it's up to you to be sure. Your management won't give a damn that youre five dollars short on on order, so it's up to you to ensure it doesn't happen.",

The order was placed online which means it couldn't have gone through without the order meeting the minimum $25 delivery + $5 delivery fee. When I arrive I have this exchange:\n\nMe: Hi, delivery from *restaurant, how are you? I'll just get these 2 for you.\n\nCustomer: 2? I only ordered the one pizza.\n\nMe: (knowing full well it was an online delivery and that this was impossible) No worries, let's just have a look. You've got your 1/2 and 1/2 Marg and Hawaiian, and a garlic focaccia.\n\nC: I didn't order the focaccia.\n\nMe: All good. If you just want to hand that back I'll knock the price off for you.\n\nC: Oh no that's alright.\n\nMe: Alright, well your total comes to $34.\n\nC: Are you still charging me for the focaccia?!\n\nMe: Sorry, I don't have the ability to pass out free food. I can take the price off if you don't want it, but if you want to take it inside unfortunately I have to charge you for it.\n\nThe customer continued to complain as he paid me, somehow I still managed a $5 tip which I was pretty shocked with as tips aren't a regular for me.\nI couldn't believe that he would try and take the focaccia without paying and think that I would let that slide?",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a delivery driver in a Division 1 College football town in the southeast. I've been delivering about 4 years now and I've seen a lot in my time. Since I've been working so long and seen so much I'm often tasked with training new employees. I've been so successful in training drivers to use phones that I now train our counter people as well. I show them the basics and then I tell these stories. The running theme is that customers cannot be trusted, believed, or even assumed to know what they're talking about.\n\nCustomers don't know where they are:\n\nCouple years ago we had a lady call up our store asking for delivery. The girl taking the order couldn't find the street the lady was on and since I knew (and still do) our range better than anyone in the company I was the go-to guy for finding houses. Our system really only needs the street number and name and it fills in the rest). The conversation went like this:\n\nMe: Hi ma'am my name is /u/bringbacktheblackout. I understand we're having some trouble finding your address in our system.\n\nHer: *in an extremely irritated tone* I don't know why. I order from you all the time.\n\nMe: It's alright ma'am. Sometimes streets can get misspelled in our system and it's really hard to fix. Could you repeat your address for me?\n\nHer: it's $address\n\nMe: Ma'am that doesn't sound like a street in our range. Are you sure you called the right store? We're the store on-\n\nHer: *screaming* I KNOW WHAT STORE I CALLED! DO YOU THINK IM A FUCKING IDIOT?\n\nMe: Ma'am we get calls all the time from people in other areas. Its not a big deal and I'd love-\n\nHer: *still screaming* NO NO NO NO! IVE ALWAYS ORDERED FROM YOUR STORE NEVER ANOTHER ONE! YOU COME OUT HERE I KNOW IT!\n\nMe: Well ma'am you seem pretty sure of yourself so what is your full address including the city, state, and zip code\n\nHer: *irritable voice* Its $address, $not our city, $not even our fucking state.\n\nMe: Ma'am, I can safely say that you're outside of our delivery area.\n\nHer: *screaming again* HOW?\n\nMe: we're located in $city in $state about 2000 miles away.\n\nHer: *irritably* Oh.\n\nHer: *click*\n\n\nI usually tell my padawans that she lied to both us and herself when she insisted that we delivered to her. \n\nThe lesson is this: Verify, verify, verify. Verify the street, verify the order, Verify what the customer is telling you. Do not respond to the customer's lies or misinformation. Do not respond to their yelling or insults. Info first, everything else second.\n\nI'll be posting more stories later but right now I've got to get some sleep.",

        "text": "Something reminded me of this story yesterday.  I had long forgotten this one, but I decided to share it here.  Hopefully you'll enjoy and I'm sure some of you can sympathize.\n\nThe most surprising things that I encountered when I started delivering were that people sometimes seemed inconvenienced by the fact that you are showing up to their home/work with their food that they ordered. People also often have no consideration for your time and have no issues making you wait an excessively long time for them to come pay you.  This mostly happens when delivering to people at their jobs.  \n\nWe had a catering order come in.  It was in the neighborhood of $400.  The restaurant I worked for did not charge a delivery fee for catering orders, so they were kind of a gamble in terms of compensation.  The woman came in the day before and placed the order and was very adamant that the order be delivered at exactly 2:00 the following day.  Deliveries were slow between the hours of 2-5 pm, so we usually had only one driver.  This day was no exception.\n\nI show up around 1:50 and bring the 5-6 trays of food inside and set them up on the table.  Some woman walked up to me and said that \"Cindy\" was on her way and had the money.  No big deal, I'll wait a few minutes.  The event that was being catered was a practice for a dance recital for 12ish year old girls.  Needless to say, I felt extremely out of place with all of these middle aged women and 12 year old girls around. \n\n Finally after waiting for 20 minutes or so, I tracked down the woman who originally had said \"Cindy\" was on her way.  She called again and I was able to overhear the phone conversation.  The bits about \"What do you mean you're still at home?\" and \"The delivery guy has been waiting for at least 20 minutes\" started to worry me.  She hung up and told me that she was leaving her house now and unfortunately wouldn't arrive for another 30 minutes.  \"Cindy\" wanted to know if I could just leave the food there, and she would stop by the restaurant and pay later that evening.  I called my boss who responded with \"absolutely not\".  He also informed me that I had 3 other deliveries waiting to take and that I needed to get back ASAP, being that I was the only driver.\n\n30 minutes later, I get a call from my boss.  We now have 6 total deliveries waiting.  He said he'd tried calling \"Cindy\" several times with no answer.  I tracked down the woman again, explained the situation, and asked if she would call her back and find out what's going on.  She called her, talked for a few minutes, and informed me that Cindy was in the Starbucks drive thru and should arrive in about 15 minutes.  She was apparently insisting on me leaving the food and stopping by to pay later.\n\nI called my boss and asked him what he wanted me to do.  He eventually told me just to stay and wait because of the dollar amount of the food.  Nearly 30 minutes later, she walks in the door, makes a snarky remark about rushing her, hands me exact change (claiming that's all the money she has), and says she'll stop by the restaurant later to leave me a tip. \n\nMy boss was furious when I returned with exact change.  At the end of the night, after she never showed up with a tip, he decided to blacklist her phone number.\n\n\n\n",

When it comes to tips, they always seem to get tipped way less and they openly acknowledge this.\n\nAnd I don't mean if you delivery zone has a rough area, most zones do, mine does.  I'm talking the guys whose ENTIRE zone is rough.  Like you're in Compton or something.\n\nAt my store, we had a driver who lived on the rough part of town and drove to our store to work.  For him, the 15 min drive was well worth the huge amount of tips he would get.\n\nMy question for you guys in the rough parts, have you ever considered delivering for a location in a better part of town to get better tips?  Or at least to lessen the chance of getting robbed?",

        "text": "So I've been working at our local pizza place for a while and I've never come across a prank order. So today we get an online order for ten large pizzas. This is a small town so ten is a big amount for us. So naturally we call to confirm but there's no answer. The address however is legit and the call center tells us to make these pizzas.\n\n  About half an hour later the last pizza is coming out of the oven. There was only the cook and me, the driver, present so it took a bit of time to make this.\n\n  I put all the pies in my car and head out. \n\nProblem #1 The street the house is on has major construction going on so I had to park a reasonable distance away. Had to walk.\n\nProblem #2 The order was meant to be paid on site by the guy but the pizzas were supposed to be dropped off to the construction crew.\n\nProblem #2.1 The construction crew had no knowledge of this order and on top of that there were only five guys working that day.\n\nSo these guys are telling me it's probably a prank and I too am thinking this. So I knock on this guys door. No answer. Ring the bell multiple times. No answer. Phone. No answer, also unreachable. Phone number doesn't exist. This goes on for like 15 minutes. So I was told by my boss to leave.\n\nWe never received a phone call from the guy and ruled it out as a prank. My boss is a nice guy and owns this store. I don't understand why people think doing this to a local pizza place owned by a local is funny. ",

        "text": "This past Saturday I was the morning driver and arrived to work at 11. On the make line we've got a ticket hanging for a 1pm order that my boss had just taken just before I showed up to work. \n\nThe order was 30 something pizzas to be delivered to a park near one of the ferry boat lines that bring people over to mackinac island.  My boss said the people didn't know the exact park name but it was a veterans park. I think alright no problem I'll just call them before I leave to clear up any confusion so I get there on time.  \n\n12:20 comes around and we've got everything ready to go.  We start running their 30+ deluxe,  meat and BBQ chicken pizzas in the oven and I step outside to try to call the customers so I can talk to them personally and get an exact location. No answer.  \n\nAbout 12:50 everything's out of the oven and my car is loaded with the order and I call the customers again who thankfully answer this time. After talking with them for a minute I realise that they aren't in Mackinaw City where my store is located,  but rather in St. Ignace.  If you're familiar with Michigan you'll know that each of these towns are on opposite sides of the mackinac bridge. \n\nSo with over 30 pizzas in my car I jump onto the bridge during peak traffic hour.  Around halfway across it turns into bumper to bumper traffic crawling at maybe 5mph. It's after 1 at this point and I don't actually arrive with their order until 1:30.  Their total is $489 and some change because they decide to get some if the most expensive specialty pizzas that we have on our menu. My boss even tried hooking them up with $10 1-topping larges but they just ordered 9 and 5 item pizzas for the hell of it.  \n\nWhen I tell him the total he asks if I have change to which I reply that I did.  $490 is what he hands me and I kind of awkwardly say that I didn't have the exact coin change in my bag but could probably find it in the car if he gave me a minute.  He then says never mind and he's not worried about the 32 cents back. \n\nMy boss covered my $8 for bridge fare by just handing me a $20 when I got back and telling him how I'd just been stiffed. I also got close to $10 commission on the order so it turned out being a decent delivery despite the shitty customer",

        "text": "Hey everyone! \n\nI'm a Shift Manager at one of the Top 3 pizza franchises and yesterday was possibly the most unlucky day of our store history. It all started the moment I unlocked the door for open. \n\nI turn the lock and right as I let go of the door, the phone rings. I answer with the usual shpeel and the customer acted like she was placing an order for one pizza. One pizza then turns into 13. I tell her it's going to be 50 minutes since I'm the only one in the store and my driver wouldn't arrive for another 20 minutes. She says it's ok and I send the order through. \n\nRight as I hang up the phone, 3 carryouts walk in to order 3 separate orders. One order was 5 pizzas, another was 3 pizzas and a breadstick, and the third was just 1 pizza. I get the carryouts in before my driver shows up, who then tries to argue with me about how I should have gotten the delivery in first (which, we are told that if people are waiting in the store, get their orders done before any others). We get the 13 pizza order done under 30 minutes and get it out to the customer before 50 minutes, luckily. \n\nSo I then continue on with my day. Prepping toppings, making the few orders that came on the screen, etc when I get another call. My second driver got in a car accident and will not be coming in. So I think \"ok, I have one driver until 4 pm, which should be ok.\" I then send my first driver to deliver a double. \n\nAt this point, my first insider is in (it's his last day and he shows up early, thank goodness) and I decide to start opening the food shipment we got from the night before. I walk into the walkin and notice that it isn't running correctly. I check, and the unit is completely frozen over. I then text my franchisee and tell him about it. He replies with an \"oh boy, be there soon.\" \n\nA few minutes later, I get yet another call. It's my first driver. His transmission on his car stopped working and now he cannot drive it. It only goes in reverse. At this point, the only words I can say is \"fucking shit\" over and over again. I'm down 2 drivers and the walkin is melting everything. \n\nI then call in my father, another driver for the store, and my GM comes in to help defrost the walkin. He then notices we're short on some food, including sauce. We only had 2 buckets of sauce left and none left to prep. The shipment had none in it. So now I'm calling other stores in the area for pizza sauce. \n\nNow let's tally up everything so far:\n\n- busy morning\n- one driver in an accident\n- one driver broken down\n- walkin freezes over\n- Pizza sauce doesn't show up.\n\nSo, after a few hours, things start to go smoothly. We have some carryouts on the screen and all of the insiders are working on the pizzas. Suddenly, the power starts flickering and eventually just shuts off. For an hour and a half, we had no power. At this point, more insiders and drivers are coming in for their shift and they can't clock in. I tell them to write down the times they came in so we can clock them in at the correct times. The only upside of this was we got a lot of boxes folded and cleaning done. \n\nAfter the hour and a half, the power turns back on, but our servers don't. Another hour goes by before our servers come back on. It's now 6 o clock and we're writing orders on paper. \n\nAt this point, I decided it was time to make a list of everything that happened on a white board. It just got longer and longer. \n\nWhen the servers return, one of my insiders had to race home because of a family emergency. At this point, Nothing worse could happen, and nothing worse did. \n\nThings started to die down and I finally made it home around 8:45 pm. I hope I never have a similar day. I'm glad it's over. I blame it on it being my insider's last day. \n\nTl;dr: \nWhat should've been a normal day turns into hell. \n\n- One driver in an accident\n- One driver broken down\n- walkin freezes over\n- Pizza Sauce doesn't show up\n- Power shuts off\n- Servers go down\n- Insider leaves for an emergency. \n\nAll because of it being someone's last day. \n\nEdit: [Here is the whiteboard list.](http://imgur.com/a/krksd) I took that photo around the time the power turned back on.\n\nAlso, it wasn't that I wasn't prepared. I usually get to work between 9-9:30 am to set up shop. That day, I got to work around 9:10. We open at 10:30. I keep one tray of each type (except pan and small, where it's just one dough) out just in case. The reason why the load time was 30 minutes was because of everything happening at once and me being the only person in the store. I had to work makeline, ovens, the phone, and help the carryouts (which, the one who ordered 5 pizzas was extremely indecisive and asked a lot of questions about specials).",
