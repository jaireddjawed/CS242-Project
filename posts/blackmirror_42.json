I am genuinely wondering if electric cars actually work this way or if they just used this as a plot device to build suspense. ",

It seems to me the rate is nearly double; comparing the first sequence of the protagonist biking and the sequence after our first introduction to the female protagonist (while watching the talent show).\n\nI, again, dont know if this is intentional, but my drunk mind happened to notice it and thought it was interesting. Although watching \"sponsored\" content during their exercise is expected to make more merits in this universe, it's interesting to note how the directors displayed such a facet without deliberately mentioning it.\n\nPoint being, has anyone else noticed this? I've watched several times and the difference seems significant. \n\n(Apologies again if this has been mentioned, searching for this type of question via reddit's search is far from intuitive)",

In between seasons 3 and 4 of BM, I watched the first series of said show. So when I saw USS Callister, I probably laughed more than most at it, having seen Brooker's comedy style. Even thinking back on some older episodes of BM I can see humor where I didn't before.\n\nWhether you've seen AToC or not, any thoughts on whether or not humor has a place in the BM universe? Not just occasional moments sprinkled throughout episodes, but more episodes in the vein USS Callister or even more over the top. Nothing extreme, only one per season, but I think it could help keep the show surprising.",

I googled other people's analysis and views on this episode (that was around a month ago) and there was no satisfying answer. Some came with wild theories.\n\nSo I came to this conclusion, which still seems unpopular but for me, it makes a lot of sense. Perhaps someone else came up with the same analysis but I didn't find anyone so far who shares the same opinion.\n\n\nI think this episode is about humans creating weapons without really thinking of the consequences. I think this is the darkest BM episodes. It's really possible to create a killer robot dog that would ruin life as we know it. Other episodes are more about controlling the consciousness but technology is not that advanced so far.\n\nThis issue is not futuristic, it happened in the past (Guns, Nuclear Bombs). Weapons that make the killing is easier and faster, the ones who invented them was probably thinking about money, political win. Not keeping in mind if others owned powerful weapons they would use it against the ones who created them in the first place. = Making us weaker and under their mercy.\n\nSo in that world, someone created a powerful smart robot dog. Humans were unable to stop them. \n\nThe dolls at the end, It shows that people would risk their lives for sentimental things, like making your nephew happy, or get rich (by selling weapons) in order to pay bills and buy a lot of stuff. Creating weapons in order to gain money is as absurd as risk your life for a doll to make a kid happy (getting shiny things for you only to enjoy).\n\nAlso spoilers on Black Museum Episode:\n[Spoiler Alert] (/s \"The Dolls might be used to store the kid's consciousness like the Monkey doll in Black Museum that's why they really wanted to get one.\")\n",
