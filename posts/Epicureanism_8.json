Mainly because I have very little in common any more with old friends, let alone philosophy. \n\nThanks for any replies. Not really concerned about it myself but when I find I agree with alot of Epicurean thought I like to explore all parts of it, even those I disagree with (I find I don't really crave many friends at this point in life). \n\ngord\n\n",

        "text": "The Empress Plotina was the wife of Trajan, and a friend to his successor Hadrian. She was also a keen Epicurean. When the school in Athens appealed to her for help she in turn applied to Hadrian for help.\n\n&gt;How greatly I favor the school of Epicurus you know full well, my lord.  The succession therein needs your help, for since none but a Roman citizen may be elected head of the school the choice is narrowly limited.  I pray therefore on behalf of Popillius Theotimus, who is now the head at Athens, that you will allow him to provide by will in Greek concerning that part of his instructions which pertains to the regulation of the headship, and to name a successor to himself of non-citizen status if he is so persuaded by the attainments of the person; and that future heads of the school may hereafter exercise with the same right the privilege you grant to Theotimus, all the more so because the practice is that whenever the testator errs concerning the choice of a head the best candidate is, by common consent, selected by the students of the school, and this will be easier if he can be chosen from a larger number. \n\nHadrian, himself philosophically minded, replied-\n\n&gt;I, Imperator Caesar Traianus Hadrianus Augustus permit Popillius Theotimus to testate in Greek concerning those matters which pertain to the succession of the Epicurean sect, and since it will be easier for him to select a successor if the option exists also to appoint from among the peregrine I guarantee this too and it will be permitted from now on to those who have obtained the succession that this right be transmitted either to a peregrine or to a Roman citizen.\n\nPlotina then passes on the news to her friends in Athens-\n\n&gt; Plotina Augusta to all her friends, greetings. We now have what we were keen to achieve. For it has been granted to each Successor who will lead the School of Epicurus in Athens, both to make dispositions about the entire administration concerning the School by means of Greek testament, and to choose at will, either a Greek or Roman Head of the School. Because this excellent extension of authority has been granted to us – which binds us to express true gratitude to him who is verily a benefactor and guardian of all culture and therefore a most venerable emperor; to me personally also most dear in all respects as both an outstanding master and a good son – it is proper that each of those who have been trusted with the decision concerning the headship always tries to appoint in his own place the best of those who share in the doctrine and to attach more importance to the view of the community as a whole than to his own predilections for particular individuals. It would therefore please me if he did not show preference to anyone over those who are acknowledged as outstanding in the power of our doctrines and, accordingly, in the superiority of their moral conduct. If this were not to be the case, not because of the particular nature of the matter, but because of our own weakness, or through some other accidental impediment, I consider it proper that he who will plan ahead for the common observances will aim for that which will please all in common and not that which will please him personally. But, by Zeus, I do not think that he who has grasped the benefit which has come to him from the teachings and is grateful for the wonderful insight it brings, by virtue of his adhering to a reasoned principle which does not permit him to abuse the magnitude of that gift, will fail to dispose by testament in such a way that both the preservation of the dignity of that place which contains the (…) will be firmly secures and equally the opinion concerning the successor of our saviour, which… when… became master of the school, since Epicurus… according to other specific qualities, not according to the pre-eminence of…\n\nAlas the inscription is faulty. This is the translation which can be found in- van Bremen, H; (2005) Plotina to all her Friends: The Letter(s) of the Empress Plotina to the Epicureans in Athens. Chiron , 35 499 - 532. ",

        "text": "I've been thinking quite hard about Religion and meaning and philosophy lately; epicureanism is a new one for me. So far I've been going about trying to prove a religion, but its hard, it might not even be possible. It feels like I might end up exactly where Epicurus ended up in his understanding of the Universe. That the gods exist but they aren't concerned. \n\nSo what to do with my life if theres no afterlife? I could devote myself to the needy, but whats the point of that in a fatalistic universe? The only thing that makes sense is the rational pursuit of pleasure. That might lead me to spending time with the needy anyway, but it would be on my terms, in a way I enjoy and find pleasurable, not out of a sense of duty.\n\nBesides the pursuit of pleasure, Epicurus also stressed minimizing pain and anxiety. Unlike many religions which stress hardships for building morals, minimizing one's pain just makes sense in a universe that has no morals or goal. And reducing anxiety allows one to live the life they want (see /r/hownottogiveafuck). \n\nFinally, epicureanism doesn't stress any silly superstitions, in fact it actively opposes them. It encourages use of rational thinking to create happiness. The science of that is called [Positive Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology). Using science to enrich one's life and produce greater pleasure is something we can all agree on.\n\n*No one chooses a thing seeing that it is evil; but being lured by it when it appears good in comparison to a greater evil, he is caught.*",

Am I correct in thinking that it represents a sort of alternative to the so-called \"Cartesian duality\"? If I understand the Cartesian duality correctly (and it's entirely possible that I don't), it suggests that the mind and the body are two distinct and separate phenomena, with the mind being dependent upon the body to exist, and with the body being unable to \"think\" (paraphrased from a description on Wikipedia). Whereas this passage seems to suggest that two are more interrelated, rather than separated in any clear way. \n\nOr am I reading this wrong? Is Lucretius actually just describing the same breakdown suggested by Descarte? It can be read that way as well, I suppose. \n\nCurious to hear what others think. Thanks in advance. \n\nEDIT: changed a sentence",

His direct comparison between the types drawn to each school struck me particularly. These are from the Thomas Common translation.\n\n\n**12**  \n\n *The Goal of Science.* What? The ultimate goal of science is to create the most pleasure possible to man, and the least possible pain? But what if pleasure and pain should be so closely connected that he who wants the greatest possible amount of the one must also have the greatest possible amount of the other, that he who wants to experience the “heavenly high jubilation,”* must also be ready to be “sorrowful unto death”? And it is so, perhaps! The Stoics at least believed it was so, and they were consistent when they wished to have the least possible pleasure, in order to have the least possible pain from life. (When one uses the expression: The virtuous man is the happiest,” it is as much the sign-board of the school for the masses, as a casuistic subtlety for the subtle.) At present also ye have still the choice: either the least possible pain, in short painlessness and after all, socialists and politicians of all parties could not honourably promise more to their people, or the greatest possible amount of pain, as the price of the growth of a fullness of refined delights and enjoyments rarely tasted hitherto! If ye decide for the former, if ye therefore want to depress and minimise man’s capacity for pain, well, ye must also depress and minimise his capacity for enjoyment. In fact, one can further the one as well as the other goal by science! Perhaps science is as yet best known by its capacity for depriving man of enjoyment, and making him colder, more statuesque, and more Stoical. But it might also turn out to be the great pain-bringer! And then, perhaps, its counteracting force would be discovered simultaneously, its immense capacity for making new sidereal worlds of enjoyment beam forth!\n\n**306.**\n\n*Stoic and Epicurean.* The Epicurean selects the situations, the persons, and even the events which suit his extremely sensitive, intellectual constitution; he renounces the rest that is to say, by far the greater part of experience because it would be too strong and too heavy fare for him. The Stoic, on the contrary, accustoms himself to swallow stones and vermin, glass-splinters and scorpions, without feeling any disgust: his stomach is meant to become indifferent in the end to all that the accidents of existence cast into it: he reminds one of the Arabic sect of the Assaua, with which the French became acquainted in Algiers; and like those insensible persons, he also likes well to have an invited public at the exhibition of his insensibility, the very thing the Epicurean willingly dispenses with: he has of course his “garden”! Stoicism may be quite advisable for men with whom fate improvises, for those who live in violent times and are dependent on abrupt and change able individuals. He, however, who anticipates that fate will permit him to spin “ a long thread,” does well to make his arrangements in Epicurean fashion; all men devoted to intellectual labour have done it hitherto! For it would be a supreme loss to them to forfeit their fine sensibility, and to acquire the hard, stoical hide with hedgehog prickles in exchange.\n\n**236**\n\n...And finally, as regards the recipe of all those physicians of the soul and their recommendation of a severe radical cure, we may be allowed to ask: Is our life really painful and burdensome enough for us to exchange it with advantage for a Stoical mode of living, and Stoical petrification? We do not feel sufficiently miserable to have to feel ill in the Stoical fashion!\n\n\n**375**\n\n*Why we Seem to be Epicureans.* We are cautious, we modern men, with regard to final convictions, our distrust lies in wait for the enchantments and tricks of conscience involved in every strong belief, in every absolute Yea and Nay: how is this explained? Perhaps one may see in it a good deal of the caution of the “burnt child,” of the disillusioned idealist; but one may also see in it another and better element, the joyful curiosity of a former lingerer in a corner, who has been brought to despair by his nook, and now luxuriates and revels in its antithesis, in the unbounded, in the “open air in itself.” Thus there is developed an almost Epicurean inclination for knowledge, which does not readily lose sight of the questionable character of things; likewise also a repugnance to pompous moral phrases and attitudes, a taste that repudiates all coarse, square contrasts, and is proudly conscious of its habitual reserve. For this too constitutes our pride, this easy tightening of the reins in our headlong impulse after certainty, this self-control of the rider in his most furious riding: for now, as of old, we have mad fiery steeds under us, and if we delay, it is certainly least of all the danger which causes us to delay. . . .",

        "text": "This is a response to [“Why I Think Epicurus Would Have Hated The Tetrapharmakon”]( http://newepicurean.com/why-i-think-epicurus-would-have-hated-the-tetrapharmakon/) which was published on NewEpicurean a few days ago. I want to preface this by saying that the essay is a good one and makes some strong points. I also think NewEpicurean is a brilliant source for people interested in Epicureanism. It is just that in this case I feel the author was a little harsh.\n\nThe Tetrapharmakos is an introduction to Epicurean thought in four lines:\n\n&gt; Don’t fear god,  \nDon’t worry about death;  \nWhat is good is easy to get, and  \nWhat is terrible is easy to endure.\n\nIt comes from one of the recovered papyri from the library in Herculaneum and we cannot be certain of the provenance. Obviously such a condensed and terse set of statements cannot possibly summarise an entire philosophy. I think however that the Tetrapharmakos has its uses.\n\nThe first use of it is as a taster, to get people interested. Whenever I see the Tetrapharmakos posted on reddit or elsewhere there are always a flood of questions. The statements are provocative even now, they would have been even more so in the ancient world.\n\n**Don’t fear god**? What does that mean? The gods of the Classical world were terrible beings. Almost any time they are shown interacting with humans the humans comes out worse from it. Paris gives an apple and destroys his homeland. Tithonus wins the heart of a goddess and is punished to a terrible eternal life. If the gods hate you then you suffer, if the gods love you then you really need to be worried. People would want to know exactly what Epicureans meant when they said not to fear the gods. \n\n**Don’t worry about death**? This is simply sound advice. Worry is bad, no one finds worry to be pleasant. Death is unavoidable. Why exactly should we worry about something which is unavoidable? It does not say that death should be ignored, only that we should not fret over it. Again this statement will bring on a series of questions in an interested audience. What is the Epicurean view of death? \n\n**What is good is easy to get**. I find this to be totally consistent with my interpretation of Epicurean philosophy. The pleasant life is the good life. The things we need to remove our wants are very easy to get. Food, shelter, friendship, all are easy to get to a sufficient level that we feel no pain from their want. If a thing is difficult to get we have to ask ourselves whether the effort to achieve it will lead to a greater amount of pleasure than the struggle costs. After our basic needs are filled we can find pleasure in very simple things. The sun is shining, go for a walk. It is raining, read a book. \n\n**What is terrible is easy to endure**. This is the most hard to understand of the four statements. I too link this to Principle Doctrine 4 - *Continuous bodily pain does not last long; instead, pain, if extreme, is present a very short time, and even that degree of pain which slightly exceeds bodily pleasure does not last for many days at once. Diseases of long duration allow an excess of bodily pleasure over pain.* We must look at this through the eyes of the ancients. If a pain was terrible then you either died quickly or recovered. If you recovered then you were no longer in pain, if you died you were no longer in pain. If nothing else then this will get people asking exactly how we are to endure the terrible.\n\nSo I look at the Tetrapharmakos in a rather generous light. It absolutely should not be taken and held up as the complete Epicurean project. But not everyone has the ability to hold the Vatican Sayings and the Principle Doctrines in their minds. These four statements are a comfort and a guide that is alwasy easy to keep with us.\n\nWould Epicurus have loved the Tetrapharmakos? I think he would have seen it as a valuable tool for spreading his philosophy and increasing the amount of pleasant living in the world.\n",

        "text": "In order to reach ataraxia we must dispel ourselves of our irrational fears. I do not fear death. I do not fear gods. Indeed, I fear very little.\n\nHowever, there is one fear which I have trouble tackling. The fear of inescapable suffering. Pain and suffering in some degree are inevitable in life, I'm not speaking of the everyday stubbed toe kind of pain.\n\nTorturous disease is one possibility. Slow and chronic pain like that of fibromyalgia or sharp and sudden pain like cluster headaches are both possibilities. Disease always leaves the agency for suicide however, a last resort of escaping pain.\n\nA healthy, friendly and unknown existence can reduce the chance of being held against ones will but we can never be sure. My main fear, however unfounded, is being physically and psychologically tortured without the opt-out choice of suicide.\n\nThe only 2 ways I can imagine to assuage these fears is 1) embrace masochism or 2) implant a failsafe suicide option such as a cyanide tooth. Both seem a little extreme and unlikely. Do you all have any suggestions?",
