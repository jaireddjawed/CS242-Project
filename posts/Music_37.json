        "text": "So, I usually do these games in context of \"I have a top 50 rotating best of list\" that I pluck a \"fave of the moment\" out of. Whether best album, best artist, best memory, etc. But, I was just looking at some stuff, and was curious what you all think of as some of the best labels of all time as far as sound goes, and what are some of the best modern reissue labels?\n\nOf course, the subjectivity of audiophile is going to marry to memories, and some of the my faves will be easily challenged. =)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Historically awesome labels:**\n\n\\- The reason I even asked this was because I was listening to a Three Blind Mice box set, and it's one of those recordings where you know from the turntable to the cartridge to the mixer to the output... that \\*I\\* can do better, and \\*I\\* am not doing enough to showcase the recording talent of that label.\n\n\\- Obviously Blue Note, but hell... they had Kind of Blue's first side mastered at the wrong speed for 60 years LOL (that whole story is bonkers and enjoyable to read). But their Rare Groove series is my happy place. I've bought way too much.\n\n\\- Deutsche Grammophon is top notch, since 1898 or so?  It's unreal the quality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**REISSUE LABELS?**\n\n\\- For the last 25 years, I've adored Right Tempo, and especially their important \"Easy Tempo\" 10 volume release. I can't speak to the audiophile level of talented mastering vs just the loving curation of some really important 60s and 70s library, lounge, film score work from Europe, namely Italy.\n\n\\- Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs is awesome, but they've even some hit and misses. I suspect some people have feelings about this label's vaunted status vs personal opinion.\n\nBut two that I can't stop spending $$$ on:\n\n\\- We Record Whatever the Fuck We Want Records (WRWTFWWR). Their ambient, experimental, classical, and jazz reissues from Japan are bonkers. Everything from selection to mastering.\n\n\\- The other is Mr. Bongo. If I had to have a gripe, it's that a lot of their reissues come in outlier cardboard sleeves that won't let a album protector slip on. LOL But the work they reissue, and the quality, is fantastic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's other labels I do really love, like XL Recordings, but holy hell some major quality control issues, right? I believe this is typical for nearly everyone nowadays, with less vinyl plants, more hurried pressings because of record store day logistics, and less production / mastering talent. Like when the windows tone popped onto a Studio One track: [https://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/k3ksqi/reggae\\_record\\_labels\\_often\\_have\\_poor\\_quality/](https://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/k3ksqi/reggae_record_labels_often_have_poor_quality/)\n\nI think about that tone nearly every day.
