Sure it‚Äôs funded, and I don‚Äôt have to pay for my masters, but it literally is not gonna help me, because no one knows the school outside of my state, it is literally the smallest school ever in the middle of nowhere, it‚Äôs not a target school so I can‚Äôt even get the jobs I want in finance with it, so all in all I‚Äôm getting a degree which will carry no weight in anything I apply for. \n\nAll I hear is ‚Äúyeah after your job nobody cares what your school name is‚Äù, well yeah , but I don‚Äôt even have my first job. Im not looking for just any job, I‚Äôm trying to break into finance wallstreet roles. I‚Äôm not even gonna get screened for interviews because of my degree name. They will just filter me out cause well, I go to a R2 institution no one has heard about. I‚Äôm going to find out if I can even get my first job in about a year and a half from this no name institution. Furthermore, I don‚Äôt even want to do a phd even more, and frankly the mere thought of doing a phd is only so I can have an R1 institution as my educational background rather than leave the last thing on my resume be this R2 school.",

I'm not the most extroverted person, so I find it hard to find the motivation to invite people out to do things.\n\nThis semester I made an effort to reach out to one person who I get along with quite well - we had a couple of nice dinners, and I expressed how I've been having a hard time with this and would love to hang out with people outside of class. She was really warm and encouraging, and said she would absolutely reach out more. We even made tentative plans to see a particular musical together. Fast forward a month, I haven't heard from her since. And this morning I noticed on Instagram that she went to that specific musical with another cohortmate, which hurt.\n\nI feel like I'm back in high school again. Has anyone else found it this difficult to make friends in grad school? My social life has essentially boiled down to staying home with my partner every night. I know I can't always rely on other people to invite me to things, but I figured it was reasonable that after the dinner at which I opened up to this person, maybe she'd reach out.

I plan on calling a few programs and asking them as well but I thought this might be a good place to get some advice from knowledgeable people who have already accomplished a PhD or are in the process of obtaining one. \n\nAlso, apart from the more general topic of PhD programs, what sort of things could I be able to do in my 3rd and 4th year that could help me stand out to Ivy League PhD programs? \n\nAny and all advice is appreciated!",

        "text": "I‚Äôm currently a 2nd year chemical engineering PhD student in the U.S.\n\nI‚Äôve been hearing that mastering out should be done earlier (first year or even deciding from start to only do M.S.), as I‚Äôve heard that doing 3+ years of PhD experience then mastering out is disastrous as you would have skills that are so niche and unattractive for potential careers. Whereas doing an M.S. in one go in 1-2 years helps you gain all the skills needed/attractable for potential careers.\n\nI‚Äôve also heard starting out and ending with M.S. is better because you would kickstart off with more career fair opportunities and internships (during first year summer) to help land the career post-graduation. But when starting off as a PhD student and then mastering out in 1-2 years, you would not have that kickstart opportunity. In that case, if I were to, for example, master out now, how should I prepare in terms of finding careers after I graduate? \n\nThank you!",

        "text": "I was accepted into a few physical therapy school programs and have been able to divide the choices down to 2. However, I have been having some issues deciding on which would be better for me. \n\nSchool A: This is a public state school I attended for undergrad. I am familiar with the environment there and still have many connections to the campus. While the program is not too expensive in terms of just tuition/fees, the cost of living raises the price considerably. This program is also larger with about 85 students split into cohorts of 50 and 35 between two campuses (I would be in the 50 people cohort). \n\nSchool B: A local private college that has a cost of tuition that is equivalent to the price of school A, but would be cheaper overall since I would commute from home. This program is a non-traditional weekend format meaning that all the classes would be held Fri, Sat, and Sun which would allow me the opportunity to work at my current job. The class size is much smaller with about 25-30 students. \n\nOne of the biggest issues of the physical therapy profession is the debt : income ratio. Going to the local school would likely be the financially smart decision to make. \n\nHowever, I personally would love to attend School A again due to the opportunity to be away from home. Living with my parents can be quite difficult with the constant arguing and butting of heads. Additionally, the covid year made it quite evident that studying at home is not conducive to a proper education which may make the likely independent study related to a weekend program much more difficult. \n\nHowever, I do feel kind of guilty for wanting to leave home for another 3 years but I would love to have the peace of mind again.",

It‚Äôs intentionally not easy to tell on a school‚Äôs website, but if they have an in-person option, compare tuition for the two. Huge red flag if they are significantly different. The online program may also have a subtly different web page and url. These companies have 100k MSW and MPH programs for example that you will never be able to pay off. And your tuition money (or loans!) don‚Äôt go to the school - these companies pocket up to 80% of it. When you email/call the number with questions about the program, you will not be speaking to someone at the school. You are speaking to a ‚Äústudent success rep‚Äù aka a salesperson trying to subtly convince you to enroll.\n\nI can‚Äôt speak to the quality of the programs themselves, but there are a number of reputable schools that have ‚Äúpartnered‚Äù with them. Some people may not care much, but when I was searching for a program I felt deceived. Personally, I find this to be a huge moral issue to profit and education in the US. These companies are contributing to the student loan crisis and do not face the consequences-they will always get their paycheck.",

On top of that, I got pregnant in the fall (planned) assuming he'd be responsive with feedback and I'd be able to finish my thesis by December. Turns out he was not responsive, so here I am in the spring semester and pregnant enough that I had to tell him partly out of courtesy (so he doesn't hear it from someone else) and partly to try and urge him to provide the feedback he's obligated to provide as an advisor... When I told him I was pregnant, he did not say 'congratulations', he said \"Ok\" and that was it. I found out this week that he told the rest of my lab group without asking me if I was ok with him telling people (which I think is illegal...). It might be different if I still had lab or field work obligations and needed to take precautions but I am quite far removed from that now and just writing, so it was totally unnecessary for them to know (and I'd have rather told them myself). Because I am trying to finish my thesis and defense before the baby arrives, I think my advisor has decided to blame the pregnancy on my delays (rather than his lack of feedback and guidance) and I'm worried he has also told my committee (and they REALLY have no need to know unless I decided to tell them myself). Overall I just feel icky about it and don't know if I'm overreacting or if it's really not ok. What would you do if this were you? He has made many borderline sexist comments (more along the lines of implicit bias, so not like flaming sexism but still not ok) in my time working with him so I'm just frustrated and exhausted.",

I've decided that for my mental health and so I can get ahead on my dissertation to resign from my position I have with him next term, even though it will cost me my health insurance and slash my pay. \n\nBasically, the chaos started before the term started when I was asking for the syllabus and a meeting to figure out what my roles were for the term. Over the holiday break I only got silence... and it wasn't until the day before classes started that I get a 5 paragraph long email saying what I was responsible for... but only for Course 1  I had with him. I asked for something similar for Course 2 and never got an email reply and when I went to his office in person he was dismissive saying \"You don't really have responsibilities in this class\". When Course 2 roles around he doesn't give me lecture material or the in class assignment I'm supposed to help teach at all and I just sit in the room feeling lost. After lecture, I confront him asking about cadence for material and he tells me that he finishes material 5 minutes before class, and proceeds to tell me my personality type is Type A while his is Type B. A few weeks later he then shifts my responsibilities to instead of going to Course 2 to create review sheets on the class material... Meanwhile in Course 1 he added even more material for the teaching assistants to grade from the quarter before and had us grading a large final project that he had graded the quarter before.\n\nThroughout the term I would let him know that I am feeling overworked and going beyond my allotted 20 hours of work and he would shrug it off. It all culminated in me sending him an email asking to push back deadlines so that I may study for my own final and have time for dissertation work. He responds saying \" that time management/allocation is not everyone's strength.\" and he \" expect that a seasoned TA such as yourself would have accounted for these timelines at the start of the quarter\".  This for me was the straw that broke the camel's back...\n\nI also acknowledge I was late to some items but had asked about them well in advance, I flew back home for my birthday and brought the finals to grade on the plane and got the students their scores for an exam a day late, after he said it was fine. And didn't end up creating the class material because it wasn't in my original job description and it would have added even more work to my plate. However, at the end of the quarter he has been holding these over me and gaslighting me into feeling like I didn't work enough this quarter...\n\nI'm interested in hearing how others would handle this situation, I feel like too often TA's are often given the shit end of the stick in academia..",

Problem is, ever since I‚Äôve gotten to this point I have hit non-stop mental road blocks (along with topic-based ones). I cannot convince myself to do anything productive related to my proposed research for my thesis that my advisor has already basically approved. Since its community based and the community has completely changed (and I‚Äôve removed myself from it), I‚Äôve lost all interest in my work.\n\nI‚Äôm just not sure what to do. At this moment, the program only has a thesis option for the degree (though I‚Äôve been told by my advisor that a non-thesis option has been in the works). Do I try to wait it out and see if this ever comes to fruition? I‚Äôm pretty sure I would only need to take exams since I‚Äôve completed all coursework (plus an extra elective, and possibly more as I might be working toward a grad certificate fot LDT). I feel like swapping programs would be an absolute waste of my time and money considering the point I‚Äôm at, but I also feel stuck because of this.\n\nAnyone else in a similar boat? What would you or have you done if so? My options are basically defer for a few months for mental health, apply for the grad certificate in LDT and focus on that temporarily, change programs, suffer and push through the issues, or drop out.\n\nThanks for any ideas and/or feedback!",

I literally was priority waitlisted in mid-January and just found out that I've been accepted; I cried so much after I saw the update. but now I also realized that there is no scholarship and so I'm a little bit disappointed. Would anyone have insights on how to go about this and if I should try to negotiate with them as I have been given scholarships/money from two other programs? If anyone has experience with this and can give some input, I'd love to hear from you. I really wanted to be in this program but I feel slightly frustrated because I really did put in so much effort to get here! Please let me know, thanks in advance :)",

I lost steam in that time of stop-go-stop-go rhythm. I'm glad to say now that things are falling back into place after grinding haaaaard to make that happen. I should be able to graduate in fall but I'm having trouble getting back into a consistent schedule (8 hours a day, 6 days a week would be ideal).\n\nI don't have a community of faculty/grads available, unfortunately. My lab is on a floor with a handful of people on it at any given time. \n\nAny advice is appreciated from the bottom of my heart.",

I had the option of attempting (another) dissertation proposal or withdrawing from the program. I chose the latter. My old adviser mentioned the possibility that completing down the road was on the table.\n\nSince that time, I've been working in industry. I also kept working with my old adviser. Published a paper with her and let her use preliminary data from my first dissertation proposal experiment for a conference. I assumed we had a good working relationship.\n\nRecently, I decided I was feeling ready for another shot. I emailed my adviser, not once, but twice, and have not received a response. This was after exchanging personal (not related to rejoining the program) emails. I was ghosted. \n\nOptions:\n\n1. Email again\n2. Email co-adviser to see if they respond (while possibly alienating the relationship between myself and my adviser)\n3. Email chair of department (with whom I had a good working relationship with, again, possibly alienating relationships)\n4. Assess if any other department/faculty might accept all my credentials so I can start at the same/nearly the same spot.\n5. Give up\n\nCompleting my PhD will not only benefit me professionally, but also personally. So, what do you think?",

In the meantime to fund IVF, I need money so if posible I would defend my Master thesis and leave for liscencing - if thats even possible. Anyone know?
