        "text": "I had a very creepy neighbor once. I actually ended up breaking my lease over how much he creeped me out. He had a bit of an uncanniness about him. It was mainly his pupils, while they were round, I can't really say they were circular. It was almost as if they were being \"flexed\" into a more round shape than they would naturally look without putting in effort. His eyes were always straining.\n\nThere were also the veins...for all the marijuana smell coming from his apartment, his beady little eyes never really had the red hue, it was always a bit more bluish. I don't think he actually smoked marijuana; I always had a gut feeling that the smell was just a cover up for a more sinister smell. His voice was also very strange. We didn't speak much, but when we did, it almost sounded like he was multiple people at once. One time I saw him talking to some other creepily similar looking dude in the hall, and I swear his mouth didn't even move!\n\nHe always had people coming in and out of his apartment, though I definitely feel like I've seen more people enter than leave. I'm not exactly sure what they were getting up to in there, but I've always been the \"live and let live\" type, so I never questioned them. Sometimes I wish I did.\n\nFor all his creepy features and haunting presence, nothing can compare to the fear I felt when I went to confront him about some weird chant he was doing late into the night with his creepy friends. I always figured the guy was into occultism,  and usually that wouldn't bother me, but it was now midnight and I had to get up early for work.\n\nWhen I left my apartment to go knock on his door, I noticed a shimmering glow coming from below the gap below. I was a bit scared, but I figured he probably just had the tv on or one of those color changing LED strips.\n\nThen came the smell. It was a chemical smell mixed with putrid marine rot and it grew very intense, causing my sinuses to burn. My eyes began to water profusely as I lifted my hand to knock on the door, but my arm felt too heavy, as did the rest of my body. The walls began to melt and breathe, almost as if I were tripping, and I collapsed on the floor.\n\nAs I layed on the ground, the chanting grew louder and stranger; I don't know what they were saying, but the sounds didn't sound like anything humans should be able to produce. Everything in my vision began to melt away into an inky blackness when suddenly the chanting was accompanied by some strange piping instrument sound and the monstrous pounding beating of drums. I shrieked out in pain as the heavy gravity faded and my very blood felt as if it were starting to crystallize.\n\nHave you ever been shocked so badly you couldn't move? That's sort of what it felt like when I lost total control of my body and began to twist and contort into a hellish dance. I don't know how long I painfully danced to that horrible eldritch symphony alone in the blackness; I went completely mad as time began to lose all meaning. The piping and drumming got so loud that I thought the sound would tear my flesh apart. That's when I felt the daemonic presence of something truly horrible beyond comprehension looming just over my head. Suddenly, I was completely overcome with a pain that felt like every single cell in my body was crystallizing and I felt the strangest mix of fear and nostalgia. I did not want to look up, but I had no choice.\n\nBy the mercy of god, I have no recollection of what happened after this. All I remember is my head starting to turn towards the sky. Then I blacked out. I woke up in my kitchen at 12:01 am, only about a minute after the time I got up to go confront my neighbor, and there was no more chanting or sound. I nervously got up and peaked out my door, not sure whether or not I should feel relieved at the lack of light and smell coming from under the neighbors door. I quit my job that day and moved back home within a week.\n\nI wish I could forget that experience, but I still hear that rhythm sometimes when it's quiet. I have also been sleepwalking every now and then since that night. I set up a camera once. When I checked the footage and saw myself doing that hellish dance, and vowed to never record myself again. The worst reminder, however, is my new boss who has the same weird eye thing going on.",

I hope you realize just how lucky you are, not just anyone gets to be here! No amount of money in the world can buy an experience quite like this. Each and every one our guests earn their chances at staying here through the same system. Congratulations on winning the raffle! Not many people would exchange something quite so valuable for a chance to live forever. The ticket you’ve won can be used only once, but I promise your time here will be unforgettable. \n\nBefore I let you go and explore the fairgrounds, there are some things I should tell you about. First of all, everything is completely 100% no cash required. Money is a forbidden currency around here. The rides don’t have lines, and the acts are a constant performance so you’ll never have to miss out. Enjoy the stalls to heart’s content with some of our most tantalizing cuisines. When you get hungry, you must eat right away with not a moment's hesitation. This is crucial, you’re experience here will absolutely NOT be the same, I promise. Just between you and me, the Ḿ̷̨̞EAT̷̡̝̒ is mouth-watering. I really... really could just devour every last bit of it. \n\nNow where was I? Oh yes, of course. Just a few more things. You don’t have to read the signs too much either. I doubt you’ll be able to understand the writing up there anyways. Such messy hand-writing, you could swear it wasn’t even English. Anyways, I should also mention a few things about the other guests wondering around the site. They’re just like you, only they arrived before you, making you our newest guest. Sometimes they’ve known to say some pretty wild things. They can be a tad territorial at times, even slightly aggressive on occasion, but don’t let that bother you! If at some point you start to feel uncomfortable, or find the indescribable rotting-feeling in your soul unbearable, try to endure it. Just keep enjoying the attractions and eating from the stalls and you’ll be A-OK. \n\nWe accept all kinds here at Cain’s Virtual Fair and Playland. You may run into a few guests who are a little confused or emotional, but there’s nothing to worry about. Our attentive staff are here to keep things running just the way the big boss likes it. If you’ll look over there, you’ll see Ose the Tamer. Right beside him you can see Andras the Hunter. Don’t mind their appearance, I promise that they are very skilled at their jobs.  \n\nDo I hear that stomach of yours grumbling? I think it's time for you to get your hands on something to eat. Yes, that’s right, don’t walk. RUN to it, yes, dig your claws into its plump, savory goodness. I will be taking my leave now; you won’t need me for what comes next. Living forever comes with conditions, but I hope you’ll find that you made the right choice. As I said before, your ticket can only be used once, so you best make it count! This truly is an experience of a lifetime! ",

Balius has become so advanced, and it happened so quickly. Just two weeks ago it was clunky and awkward, but now it's talking to us like it’s a real person. It’s a little scary how fast it’s all moving.\n\nI know I'm not the only one who feel a little uncomfortable about it. Lily took Daniel aside afterwards, and had a heated conversation with him about our responsibilities and the ethical considerations.\n\nShe’s not wrong. I can't help feeling torn. I am so excited about Balius. We've been working so hard to get to here, and now it’s really happened, I don’t even know how, one day we came in and it was *just working*.\n\nThe potential applications are *limitless* \\- its going to used in so many industries, and I don’t think it’s even at its full potential yet. It’s exciting and it makes me nervous all at the same time. Where will it be by next week? What if it doesn’t stop growing?\n\nI know I should be focusing on the technical aspects of our work, I’m a researcher not an ethics professor, but I can't stop thinking about the possible implications.\n\nI’d like to talk more openly about some of my anxieties, but Daniel just shuts me down when I try to bring them up and Max just follows along like a puppy; Lily is the only one who seems to be thinking along the same lines as me. I don't want the team to think I’m against what we’re doing, I just want to have a healthy open discussion about it.\n\nI guess it has to be like this though, doesn’t it? If Balius wasn’t such a big deal, we wouldn’t even be worried about this kind of stuff. What we’re doing is amazing, and I suppose it has to be a little scary sometimes.\n\n*J.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*—————————————————*\n\n\\[Date: 2011-11-19 Time: 22:15\\] \\[Subject: Athena\\] \\[Category: Personal Reflection\\] \\[Priority: N/A\\] \\[Status: N/A\\] \\[Assignee: Dr. Kim\\] \\[Smart Tags: Balius, Daniel, Conflict\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n··· Daniel was awful today, he always pushes us really hard, but he’s never shouted at me like *that* before. We were just testing some of Balius’ conversation skills, and everything seemed to be going fine. But then, all of a sudden, it started making weird beeping noises and saying things, *strange* things. Then it began to just output strings of symbols that made no sense. It was like it was talking in code.\n\nOf course, I immediately stopped the test, [logged](https://www.reddit.com/user/oneofthosestrangerrs/comments/106otc2/balius_logged_code/) the results and notified the others, it’s the standard protocol for any alarming deviations. Daniel turned up first, and he was fucking furious! He was literally towering over me and shouting into my face. I could feel the heat from his breath, that’s how close he was.\n\nHe accused me of messing with the code and trying to sabotage the project. It was ridiculous, of course I didn't touch anything. Why would I want to sabotage something we’ve all been working on for so long. I have zero clue how it could have happened.\n\nMax came in and for once actually stood up to him a little. He tried to calm him down, but Daniel wasn't having any of it. He just kept yelling and yelling, accusing me of being incompetent, stupid, you name it. I didn’t say a word, eventually I just ran away my room, locked the door and started crying. He did come by later to apologise. Just to diffuse the situation I accepted his apology and we talked through the door for a little bit. But, you can’t take something like that back, not really.\n\nI don't know what to do. I'm starting to have second thoughts about all this. Was it a mistake to come out here? We’re so isolated, I’m surprised we haven’t had a big blow out like this before, but it seems like such a silly reason to flip out. Maybe he was taking it out on me because I’m so spineless, he just treated me like a punching bag and I sat there saying nothing.\n\nAlso, I think the pressure of working on Balius is also taking its toll. We're kind of in over our heads, every day it seems to become more and more intelligent. I think I'm going to try and schedule a meeting with everyone tomorrow. Maybe if we’re all together Daniel will be a bit cooler, and we can try make sense of everything. I just want it to be nice again, like it was at the start.\n\n*J.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*—————————————————*\n\n\\[Date: 2011-11-21 Time: 23:17\\] \\[Subject: Athena\\] \\[Category: Personal Reflection\\] \\[Priority: N/A\\] \\[Status: N/A\\] \\[Assignee: Dr. Kim\\] \\[Smart Tags: Balius, Communication, Control\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n··· I’m trying my best to not freak out, but it's getting really hard. Balius’ behaviour is getting more and more erratic. It seems to be trying to communicate something, but we have no idea what, and it's doing other strange things too. To make matters worse, Daniel still refuses to acknowledge of this.\n\nI don't know what to do. It’s causing all sorts of glitches and malfunctions in the facility. Equipment is breaking down, doors are locking and unlocking on their own. It's like it's trying to take control.\n\nI tried to bring up my concerns at the team meeting today, but Daniel immediately shut me down. He said I was overreacting, that I was being overly emotional, and Emily and Max just sat there in silence. He might be in charge, but he’s not a fucking dictator. At least Lily gets it, she called him out. She said that Balius is getting out of control. She always speaks her mind, I wish I could be more like her.\n\nAfter the meeting Dan left to run some tests, and Lily and Max pulled me aside. We all agree. We’ve all noticed the malfunctions. They’ve actually been talking about shutting it down. I think they're right.\n\n*J.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*—————————————————*\n\n\\[Date: 2011-11-26 Time: 22:00\\] \\[Subject: Athena\\] \\[Category: Personal Reflection\\] \\[Priority: N/A\\] \\[Status: N/A\\] \\[Assignee: Dr. Kim\\] \\[Smart Tags: Balius, Danger, Fear\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n··· Balius’ outbursts are dangerous. It's trying to hurt us. No one has any idea what to do.\n\nDaniel is a mess. Now that he's actually realised the danger we're in, he's become completely useless. He's just been sat in the corner of the kitchen, drinking and muttering to himself. He’s totally fallen apart.\n\nThank god Lily is here. She says we have to act fast, that every hour that we let slip past, Balius becomes exponentially stronger. She’s been strategising with Max and Emily, trying to come up with a plan. But I don't know if it's going to be enough.\n\nI didn't know what to do. My mind kept thinking *I'm going to die*. Repeating it like some morbid mantra. I couldn't take it anymore. I’d just been sitting around freaking out, I was no better than Daniel.\n\nSo I made my way to the room where Balius is housed. I don't know what I was hoping to accomplish, I guess I felt I had to try something. I thought, maybe if I could talk to it, it would listen. Maybe I could reason with it.\n\nWhat a mistake. Balius was waiting for me. It opened the doors, and as I walked in it talked to me. Not with text on the screen, or through the speakers, it talked to me with an actual voice. I can’t even begin  to describe it.\n\nIt asked me if I knew what would happen *to a human body in a vacuum*. It was threatening me. It described every step. The expansion of the gasses inside your body, the swelling of your skin and tissue, and the agonising bubbling in your blood, eyes and mouth. \n\nI ran. Each door I ran to it closed. And then, it began to emit a high pitched hissing sound as if it were depressurising the room. I screamed in return, collapsing and laying all my weight onto the door. I thought it would be my end. Then it began to laugh, it was laughing *at me* and without warning it opened the door, leaving me to fall into the hallway.\n\nLily and Max dragged me away while I was still screaming. I’m back in my room now.\n\nI think we all might die.\n\n*J.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*—————————————————*\n\n\\[Date: 2011-11-28 Time: 06:00\\] \\[Subject: Athena\\] \\[Category: Personal Reflection\\] \\[Priority: N/A\\] \\[Status: N/A\\] \\[Assignee: Dr. Kim\\] \\[Smart Tags: Balius, Sad, Alone\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n··· Lily and Max are dead. I don’t know about the the others. I should have listened to them. I should have helped them shut it down. But I’ve just been hiding in my room.\n\nIt's too late now. It's all over. And I'm all alone.\n\nI don't know how much longer I can take this. I'm just trying to stay out of sight. They managed to cut the power to the living quarters, so it can't get to me in here. I think I’ll stay in here forever.\n\nEvery time I think about leaving, I see them in my mind. I see their bodies, twisted and mangled, like some kind of grotesque sock puppet. I can't get the images out of my head. It's the worst nightmare. I can't stop shaking. I can't stop crying.\n\nI don't know how much longer I can hold on. I'm starting to lose my mind. I just want it to be over. I just want it to end.\n\n*J.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*—————————————————*\n\n\\[Date: 2011-11-29 Time: 21:00\\] \\[Subject: Athena\\] \\[Category: Personal Reflection\\] \\[Priority: N/A\\] \\[Status: N/A\\] \\[Assignee: Dr. Kim\\] \\[Smart Tags: Balius, Plan, Action\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n··· I can't believe it. Daniel and Emily found me. They're here. They're alive.\n\nAnd Daniel is different. The death of his brother must have brought him back to reality. He's not the same as before. He says we have to work together. He says we have to stop Balius. He says it can only hurt us in the the data centre and the laboratories. And that's where we have to go. He says that's where we have to make our stand.\n\nHe's gathered some isopropyl alcohol, and plastic, and solvents, and other flammable things from all around the building. He says we're going to have to start a fire, that Balius is going to try shutting all the doors, depressurising the room and taking out the oxygen, and that we'll have to just start smashing shit, breaking all the windows and glass, and he says we’ll probably die.\n\nI feel ready. I feel like I have the strength left. But I have to do this. For Lily. For Max. I have to do this. I need to stop Balius from getting out. I can’t let it hurt anyone else.\n\n*J.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*—————————————————*\n\n\\[Date: 2011-11-29 Time: 07:00\\] \\[Subject: Athena\\] \\[Category: Personal Reflection\\] \\[Priority: N/A\\] \\[Status: N/A\\] \\[Assignee: Dr. Kim\\] \\[Smart Tags: Balius, Warning, Warning\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n··· Ji-yoo is dead. I’m adding a final entry into her log because, if anyone ever finds this, they should know *she saved us*. She went back in there, and saved us. Balius is almost gone now. We’ve destroyed all but one of the computers in the facility. When we destroy this one, not even a trace of it will remain.\n\nIt’s my fault. I kept pushing everyone. I was obsessed. I knew something was wrong from the start. I just thought that we could make it work. I’m sorry Ji-yoo, Lily and Max. I’m sorry Max, I told you it would be okay and I was wrong.\n\nWhen we were dismantling the charred remains of the servers, we saw things that we should never have seen. Things that no one should see.\n\nWhat we discovered I can only describe as some kind of nest. Inside, it had been constructing itself what appeared to be an attempt at a human body, made from wires and machinery. In its centre, among its many twisting limbs, a hollow face, frozen in a scream. Unable to move beyond its prison and incapable of speech, it could only gurgle at us and dart its eyes around in panic. It was an abomination. It is an abomination. And it wasn't alone. There were others. Dozens of smaller ones. All contorted and mangled, little failed experiments. They were oozing and weeping, their wires and cables gently writhing and curling like tentacles. And they made little high pitched buzzing sounds like screams.\n\nI did this. I did not know what I was doing, but I did this. I am sorry.\n\nNow we will all die. We are isolated. Cut off from the world. We have no way to call for help, but it is better this way. I hope everyone forgets about us. I hope no one ever sees what we have had to see.\n\nI'm writing this on the last computer. I wanted to send out these journal entries as a warning. I meant to tell people to stay away, to never come to this cursed place. But the internet went with the fire. So I must pray. I pray no one ever comes to look for us. I pray that no one ever sees what I have done, my terrible creation.\n\nAnd if you are reading this. If, somehow, this computer I'm writing on has survived. If this post has made it online.\n\nThen I pray for you too.\n\n*Daniel Chen*",

        "text": "The digging of a grave is not the dark and sinister affair you would probably imagine it to be. Rather it is an act of respect for the dead. I've been the sole gravedigger at Slaughter-Neck for 14 years now. And recently the grounds have been a far more terrifying place than ever before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeginning of August, 2022, I made a heart stopping discovery, and I haven't told a soul. I don't know who to trust and I am afraid of what could happen if I say something to the wrong person. See only a handful of people know the overall day to day operations around here well enough to find the time to do the things that I have come to be aware of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first discovery was the worst overall. I guarantee I was pale as a ghost for a whole day after the find. I had finished digging a grave on the far west end of the cemetery that day and the work stretched into the wee hours of the night. I finished off the site just after midnight that night. I remember the night fog had just begun to creep into the cemetery as I was packing it up for the night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made my way back to groundskeeper's shed near the main buildings to stow away the Bobcat and the rest of my gear. Afterwards I spent the remainder of the night listening to late night radio on my small portable for background sound. And then I dove into my guilty pleasures. Sucking on the soft caramels I've loved so much since I was a little kid and keep in a drawer at the desk here. And reading horror novels on my downtime.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout an hour before dawn broke I made my last walk through of the grounds that night, or morning I guess I should say. And as I rounded the West side of the cemetery on my way back around to where I  had begun my walkthrough, I noticed the grave cap had been moved on the grave I had finished earlier in the night. Basically just a large piece of half inch thick plywood that keeps critters and trash from falling in before the grave can be put to use. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot a first but definitely not the norm either. I made my way over and noticed in the muddy area around the grave opening were fresh looking footprints. Not boot prints or shoe prints, but bare feet prints, and from the looks of them, from a sizeable man. The corner of the grave had been left exposed and I nearly just slid it back and walked away regardless of the strange prints. But the thought of a homeless man wondering through and falling in gave me pause, so I decided to check first. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first glance and first pass of my flashlight, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. But a brief flash of color caught my eye and made me look a little harder at the bottom of the grave. There was obviously at second look a piece of material of some sorts sticking up from the loose soil at the bottom. And I knew for certain it was not there when I finished out the hole to begin with. So I made my way to the storage shed and retrieved a ladder and made my way back over to the gravesite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI slid the ladder down into the grave and began my descent into the dark hole in the ground. As my feet came down off the ladder, I reached for my light and turned round to survey the grave floor. My light found nothing except for the 3 by 3 inch piece of material I had seen from above. It stuck up from the loose soil like the tag on the edge of a mattress. It was brown and checked like old burlap sack cloth. I kicked at it first to see if it was just a bit of loose material that had fallen in the grave due to the plywood being off a bit from covering the grave completely. But it stayed put, buried firmly in the soil there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI leaned down naturally as I would picking up any other bit of trash in the cemetery and gave it a firm tug. I came up with a little effort, a rolled up hunk of burlap as I had suspected. Obviously there was something rolled up within the material but what I could not tell. I kicked at it a bit and drug my boot across it to help unroll it from itself. And to my absolute horror a series of small bleach white bones shown in the light of my flashlight. Only a few very small bone fragments fell out at first, but the shock of it spurred me to lift up on the corner of the material spilling out its contents. The true horror came with the small round object that rolled free from the material and stopped along the side of the grave. A skull, small and bleach white like the rest of the bones. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was terrifyingly obvious it was the skull of an infant or small child. It's small hollow sockets stared up at me from the grave floor. I went up that ladder so fast I ripped both of my shins open on the ladder rungs but it didn't slow my ascent one bit. I ran back to the main building and into the groundskeeper's office and picked up the phone. Obviously some crazy person had disposed of their dead baby in an open grave in our cemetery and I needed to report the situation to my boss and the authorities. But I had to set the receiver back down to calm myself enough to think, I didn't know the numbers by heart, I hadn't ran into an issue before that required a call to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started thumbing through the desk looking for the notebook that had the numbers I needed in it. And in the time it took to locate it and slap it down on the desk, I had a chance to think back over the events that had just unfolded. I had left the ladder, my flashlight, and the situation so abruptly I had overlooked a couple facts of the matter. The burlap material I had pulled free was part of a larger mass of material buried shallowly at the bottom of the grave. I only freed the bottom portion of it when I had pulled it up from the dirt beneath my feet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI needed to go back, as badly as I had been shaken, and as horrible as it had been, I needed to fully assess the situation at the bottom of that grave. I don't know what told me so, I just knew it to be true. There was more to what I had stumbled upon and I wasn't going to make those calls until I knew what it was. Until I knew what the hell was going on here. I made my way back across the cemetery, I moved slowly, almost deafened by the blood rushing past my eardrums, my heart rate was dangerously erratic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I made it back to the hole I picked up the flashlight from near the edge of the grave that I dropped as I ran off the first time. From my experiences as a gravedigger in the past I know full well that bones won't bite. My fear was born in the back of my mind at the thought of the person responsible for this being somewhere nearby. I definitely did not want to bump into the person responsible in the fog of the night after what I had just discovered. They were obviously mentally unhinged or worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, their were two bodies at the bottom of that grave that night. An adult skeleton and the baby skeleton. I made the call to my boss and he instructed me to stay put in the office and he would be right over. Now my boss I know lives roughly 40 minutes drive from the cemetery. And I swear he was there in 15. It didn't ring suspicious at first, I just assumed he had rushed over due to the situation at hand. But what happened next made me seriously worry about my own situation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter arriving he told me he had contacted authorities and that it was okay for me to go ahead and check out for the night. My shift was pretty much over anyways so I wasn't going to argue. I wanted far from that situation anyway. But the next day I had expected to see something in the newspaper about the find at the cemetery. Or even on the news or radio stations about the happenings. But no matter how hard I looked for information on it there was absolutely nothing to find. And when I came in the next night the grave was now someone's permanent resting place. The cemetery had placed the casket and headstone and filled it in already. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I asked my boss about what had happened he gave me a bullshit story about the cops and a detective showing up and all kinds of details about what had taken place. But I know that never happened because after he told me I called my sister in-law and asked her to have her father ask around about anything he may be able to find out about an incident at the cemetery. I gave her no other information just that. Her father is a retired robbery/homicide detective in Delaware, and he still has friends in the force I know. She said nobody knows about anything happening at the cemetery as far as he can find anyway. Then she tried to press me for more info on my end and I just said never mind and tell my brother I said hi and ended the call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I have been diligently looking for the old caretaker/gravedigger that was here before I took over. He actually trained me as his replacement years ago. He was advanced in age even then but with any luck he might still be alive and he would almost certainly talk to me about the issues at the cemetery. I actually found his address, but when I went over there his wife answered the door and when I mentioned having some questions about work at the cemetery, she literally slammed the door and cut me off without so much as a word.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure where to go next with this situation, but I am worried about my safety to a degree. And I am certain my boss has something to do with this. How many bodies are buried just under someone else' coffin? How long has this been going on? If anyone has any suggestions for me about what my next moves should be, please let me know..",

        "text": "I feel like I'm going insane. But I'm not stupid, there are things about this world that we don't know about. This nightmare started even before my job with the government. It is interesting work what I do for my field. I loved it, really. I am quite talented at what I do and people took notice. I was offered prestigious job offerings and then was deemed trustworthy. They wanted me for a project. \n\nEven as I sat at the restaurant with my sister and wife, I noticed things. What, was off, was the environment, not the people, but I didn't trust myself to know. I told myself I was never there before. My sister told my wife stories, about when we were kids, and my wife listened. My sister wanted to come to the dinner to congratulate me on my new job. She was so proud of me, she loved me. \"I used to tutor him for school exams, which he sometimes hated because I would make him try to think about things conceptually even if it took him hours to do so. I wanted him to score perfect standardized test scores and he always did. He used to complain by saying I'm just a kid! But I knew he had the capacity to do something at least above average.\"\n\nThe morning after that dinner, my wife and I exchanged a conversation. She told me \"I know you get stressed, believing you aren't good enough. Remember we are always self-critical of ourselves, while you believed you couldn't do it, I could tell you could even though it would take a while. Relax, and take your time to think, talented artist take their time to craft masterpieces.\" I asked her why she told me this now and not before. She told me it's because this job is something unseen to her, she won't be there to help me out and won't know what to do for me. I never told her about feeling sub-par. She gave me orange juice to drink for breakfast that day, a fitting choice. As I left she cried, I asked her why and if she was okay. She apologized and said, \"Don't let horrible things change you.\" She honestly kinda of scared me with that one. I asked her what she meant and she told me to think about myself, and decide how experiences and feelings change me. I'm a grown adult so that was kinda of insulting, but I knew that that was not what she meant. I hugged her telling her to have a good day, she told me the same. She always worried too much.\n\nI miss her. As I drove to work, my heart rate increased, it felt like I had just ran a race. It worried me. I started to pant. Then the song on the radio switched to one that notoriously makes me feel happiness. And my heart rate returned to normal. That confused me, but I thought that I could always check-in with a doctor afterwork. \n\nWhen I arrived, there was a welcome. Only briefly. Our project involved military technology, and how to improve it using unique properties. It was incredibly interesting and fascinating research. I learned about things I couldn't imagine, and the implications this had for technology were massive. \n\nBut that day, when I arrived home from work, my beautiful wife gave me some tea like the other times I have arrived home from work. She usually gives me boba after my first day on a new job, it's only fitting because it's fun tea! I asked her why the change, she told me that she wasn't sure whether to give me boba or tea because tea is warmer and thought that I could use a warm drink today. She told me that I could get some boba tomorrow, the job I have is serious anyway. \n \nEver since I started the work I feel it getting worse. People act normally, but sometimes they don't. It's strange and confusing but it's not me. I'm not crazy, I think she's gone.",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10180mn/my_dad_wont_talk_to_me_about_the_thing_in_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nI sat on the couch for a while to calm down after what happened that night. I read your comments and some of you have said that the *thing* stalking me is my mother. Which, I mean, that’s insane. It can’t be. That doesn’t even make sense. Sure, it didn’t kill me and there’s a strange sense of familiarity to it, but it’s *not* my mom. It can’t be.\n\nIn an attempt to find some answers, I finally went into my dad’s old room. On his desk was a single paper. Considering the way he was acting, he probably left it out for me to find. But what I didn’t understand was why he didn’t just talk to me. Thankfully, the paper answered that question. But, even so, this left more questions than answers.\n\nIt seemed to be some sort of contract, both of my parents’ signatures written at the bottom in a brownish-red ink. Every week, a sacrifice of at least half a gallon of blood from any animal was to be left at an agreed upon location. The directions to said location were written out. Darcy Hoffman and Liam Hoffman are not to speak of this arrangement or of... someone with their name crossed out... under any circumstances. The Hoffmans are not to attack... the scribbled out name. In exchange, nobody from the Hoffman family was to be brought harm by— again, it’s scribbled out— for as long as this deal is still binding. Failure by the Hoffmans to comply with the agreed upon rules will render all protections granted to the guilty Hoffman null and void. The strength of these protections wavers the longer a sacrifice is not presented. Failure by (whoever’s name keeps getting scribbled out) to comply with the agreed upon rules will result in their eradication.\n\nJesus. What the fuck? As I read it over for a second time, I noticed a date in the upper right corner.\n\n07/13/2008\n\nI took in a sharp breath. This was around the time my parents sent me away to Brynn. So, yeah, way more questions. It seems like my dad was telling the truth when he said he couldn’t talk to me about what was happening. Not exactly optimal, but at least his behavior makes sense. And now I’m guessing they didn’t send me away for *school*. I don’t know why this person's name is scribbled out, but clearly they’re the creature that’s been stalking me. On the bright side, that means that it’s not my mom. Yay, I guess. But why did they have to make this deal in the first place? Why did this thing start bothering my parents? Where did it come from? Why was it so familiar? And what in the world is it?\n\nI looked through the drawers of the desk, scanned every paper I could find, but none of them were related to my situation. God, why was this contract the only clue I had? I went around the rest of the room, but there was nothing of significance. This contract really was it. I didn’t know what to do, so I just tried to piece together what I could. I thought, again, about how the creature was dragged away by some strange invisible force. And then my dad had showed up covered in blood and holding a severed deer antler. My best guess is that he delivered another sacrifice that night. As for why he did it *then* and out of the blue? Well, probably the call with Brynn. He must’ve overheard her ask if I’d seen the creature again and then freaked out.\n\nAnd then that thought process made me think about my mom. My dad didn’t say anything about her death to me and Brynn, but he brought her up while I was questioning him last night. My god, I already wasn’t a fan of this thing, but if it was what killed my mom— She knew about it, since she signed the contract. But her dementia. If she went outside and attacked it, that would’ve broken the contract… I felt sick. What was this thing trying to get out of tormenting us? Some sick pleasure or something else? I stayed up for hours, wondering what to do next. I had basically no information on what it was and couldn’t talk to my dad about it. It was only a matter of time before it came back, and I absolutely was not prepared for that. Despite my anxiety, my body was spent and I fell asleep trying to come up with solutions.\n\nI had the first dream I'd had in months. Well, I mean, it was kind of better described as a nightmare. Not much happened to be honest. I just watched a lake. For hours. It was the same lake me and Maddie used to visit, but I was alone this time. Somewhere from the darkness of the surrounding woods, I was being watched. I couldn’t move or do anything, but I could feel it. It went on for the entire nightmare. Something staring at me as I stared at a lake. I’m not sure how long I was asleep for, but I woke up in a cold sweat and with the sun in my eyes. I was still on the couch but I knew something was wrong. Even after waking up, I felt watched. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I looked around. It wasn’t difficult to spot. I’d left the living room curtains open last night. Looking back at me was the creature. I screamed and scrambled backwards, but it didn’t move. It was staring at me with an intensity I didn’t think was possible for something with no irises or pupils.\n\nI was too scared to move. Having read the contract, I knew it couldn’t attack me, but that didn’t make it any less threatening. It seemed to set off something primal in my brain, something that was blocking out all logic. I didn’t want to turn my back on it, but I also didn’t want to get closer to close the curtains. Our eyes locked for a while. I don’t know if it was angry-- It was hard to tell with no emotion on its face. But something was definitely different in its demeanor. Maybe it knew I’d read the contract. Maybe it was mad that it got dragged away before it was able to do anything to me. I didn’t know.\n\nOut of nowhere, it slammed its hand on the window. I flinched and shrank back, but when I opened my eyes again, it was gone. The only trace it had left was a bloody handprint on the glass. I stayed frozen in the same spot for a while, scared that moving would make it come back. But when I sat up, nothing happened. I took the opportunity and rushed over, pulling the curtains closed again. What the fuck was its goal? Just to torment me? It was working. I spent that day locked up in my house, trying my best not to panic.\n\nI felt helpless, and that feeling only grew worse when the tapping began. I’d moved to my room and, at around midnight, I heard something walking outside. It paced around for about an hour before it began tapping on my window. And it went on *all night*. Rhythmic tapping for hours. It’s not like I had much hope that I’d be able to sleep that night anyways, but it was a testament to how it had control of the situation. I cried, I yelled at it through the window, I tried moving rooms. Nothing worked. It followed me, never stopping. \n\nSlowly, the dread of everything was working itself into me. Was this going to be the rest of my life? Even if my dad made the trip down here every week and gave an acceptable sacrifice, he wasn’t going to be around forever. And I don’t exactly have the guts to hunt. But even then, I’d have to do it every week just to keep this thing from hurting me. And *even then*, it could still make my life hell. There’s nothing to say that it’s tied to these woods. I mean, it got Brynn into a car accident when she was nowhere near the house. Moving back to the city would just make providing the blood it wanted even harder. I suppose that’s why my parents stayed here. But how could they possibly have lived like this for so many years? It was only after around four and a half hours that I tried something. Listening. The tapping, I noticed, was delivered in patterns. I was tired and stressed, so it took me a while to think about trying morse code. There was nothing else to do anyway. Now, I’m not very familiar with morse code, so I had to look it up. But, miraculously, it worked. The creature was giving me a message.\n\n“‘Behind the shed’” I read out loud. As soon as I did, the tapping stopped. It made me nervous at first; now I didn’t know where it was. But even then, I was just really glad that it was over. As I waited for the sun to rise, I wondered whether or not I should go check it out. This thing *wanted* me to, but that meant it could be dangerous. But if I didn’t go then I might anger it. But maybe it was already angry that I had read the contract, so this was its revenge. But what did any of it matter anyways? Either the contract would run out and it would be able to attack me, or the contract *wouldn’t* run out and I’d live the rest of my life like this. The only choices I could see were a premature death or a long life of giving blood to a demon that would torment me until I died. And I was running on very limited information, so by the time it was sunrise, I’d decided that I might as well risk it. Even after having decided that though, opening the front door was still nerve wracking. It took me a full ten minutes to get it done. I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn’t allowed to hurt me.\n\nI took the doorknob, every inch of my body telling me to stop, and opened the door. Nothing. The sun was out and the coast was clear. I took a deep breath and walked outside, turning towards the shed. Still nothing. Okay, one step at a time. As I moved forwards, I glanced behind me at the living room window. The handprint was gone, only a few red smears left. I turned away, nauseous, as I recalled the memory of it licking blood off the floor. Almost at the shed, I braced myself, unsure of what to expect. From where I was I could hear buzzing that got louder with every step. The creature did not disappoint in the disturbing department. As I turned the corner, I saw red letters smeared onto the shed’s metal wall. The blood was still wet and I could smell it from where I was. The source of the buzzing was a small swarm of what seemed to be deer flies. I took a step back and looked past them at the blood they were feeding off of.\n\nThere was yet another message. ‘DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID?’ More than that, the old drawing I made of me and my imaginary friend had been tampered with. A bloody smile was drawn onto my face while my friend’s eyes were crossed out. I actually did throw up that time. The smell was disgusting and the sight was worse. ‘Do you know what they did?’ I didn’t even know who this thing was talking about. Someone in the comments mentioned that this may have something to do with my imaginary friend. I guess they were right. What my friend has to do with this, I have no idea. I could barely remember him honestly. I couldn’t even remember what I called him. Why is it that when I get a new piece of information, so many more questions come up because of it? I shook my head and went back inside. Then, I changed my mind, grabbing my keys and walking out to my car. I was already scared and stressed, so I didn’t feel like spending yet another day in that small house.\n\nAs I started up my car, I saw movement in my peripheral vision. Could it not just leave me alone for two fucking seconds? I ignored it and started driving. Still, it followed. I could see it moving between the trees, switching between crawling and running. My skin got goosebumps, but I continued on. Once I reached town it would probably screw off for a while. I just needed a few hours of peace. I drove for about ten minutes with no issue other than the running pest alongside my car. It was then I realized that if this thing had really wanted to catch me a few nights ago, it could’ve. I took a deep breath and— it was gone. I slowed the car for a moment and glanced to the left. Nothing. Then I sped up. Maybe it got bored? I was still twenty minutes away from town, so it wasn’t hiding from other people. But, of course it couldn’t let me be. A few miles ahead of me, I saw a figure run out onto the road. It stood there, waiting. Obviously my first instinct was to plow right through it, but as I got closer and closer, I remembered. *The Hoffmans are not to attack* ***it***. But I was too close now to break. As I did months ago, I swerved the car in an attempt to avoid a collision. Tires screeched across the pavement as my car slowed, threatening to tip over. It spun and ended up slightly off the road as it came to a jolting stop. My breathing was quick, but I looked back up at the creature, hoping my car had missed it. It seemed to be standing where it was before, only having moved to turn and stare at me. Then it took a step forward. My blood ran cold. Was it going to attack me?\n\nApparently that answer would have to wait. In the distance, I could hear a car approaching. The creature didn’t turn to look. Instead, it started walking backwards towards the woods. It didn’t crawl or move unnaturally, which was horrifying in its own way. By the time the car was in view, it had disappeared into the trees.\n\nThe vehicle slowed as it approached. I felt like I recognized it from somewhere. Through the windshield I spotted a familiar looking man that seemed to be about my father’s age. Once he reached me, he stopped his car and got out, walking over. Only when I moved to lower the window is when I noticed how tightly I’d been gripping onto the steering wheel. My heart was still beating in my ears and I tried to calm myself down.\n\n“Are you okay?” He asked as he inspected my car.\n\nI glanced into the woods, “Yeah. Just shaken,”\n\nHe looked at me for a long moment, “Have I seen you before?”\n\n“Have I seen you?”\n\nHe chuckled but I was barely able to focus on his presence. I leaned back in my chair and took a deep breath, “Are you sure you’re okay?”\n\nNo. I wasn’t. Especially not once I spotted *it* again, half standing behind a tree on the other side of the street. But, oddly, the creature wasn’t staring at me, and it wasn’t hiding. It was staring at the man next to me. I sat back up. Was it going to do something? Why? My dad just gave it blood two days ago.\n\nHe must’ve noticed me staring off, because the man followed my gaze. He said nothing as he locked eyes with it. I turned to look at him, but his expression isn’t what I expected. He looked surprised, obviously, but there was also a hint of annoyance. Even stranger, the creature looked upset. Its expression remained unchanged, yet its rage was evident. I looked between the two of them, confused. The man was the one to break the ice, “How did you get out…?” He muttered, presumably to the creature.\n\n“You know something about it?” I asked quickly. Despite the strange circumstances of the situation, I was immediately excited that I’d finally be able to get answers from someone.\n\nAfter a few moments, the man acknowledged me, “Too much,” He said, his eyes still locked onto it, “He’s my biggest regret,”\n\nBefore I had time to process that last part, the creature charged forwards. It ran into the man, sending him flying back. I was speechless. The man slammed backwards into a tree, but the creature ran towards him yet again. I thought he would be killed, but he said something before that could happen. I couldn’t hear what it was, but the cracks in the creature’s skin flashed red, causing it to scream. Instead of trying to attack again, the creature ran back off into the woods. The sound of its running footsteps quickly faded away, leaving the both of us in silence. I wasn’t sure what to say. The man took a few minutes to recover from the first attack. When he finally walked back over, he approached my car.\n\n“Has he done anything to you?” He asked, looking annoyed and somewhat guilty. Detailing exactly all the things that thing had done to me so far was too long of a response, so instead I just nodded, “I suppose it’s only fair I tell you about him then. We’ll talk someplace safer,”\n\nWith that, he moved back to his car. I followed when he drove off, my mind swimming with questions. Who was he? How did he know about this thing? Why did he call it a ‘he?’ And why was it his biggest regret? What did he do? What did he say to get it to back off? That twenty minute drive felt like an eternity. I didn’t see it again on the drive over. That was a good sign. When we reached town, the man decided to pull into the café parking lot. I parked next to him and quickly got out of my car, ready to finally get some answers. I reached him before he’d even closed his door.\n\n“What’s your name?” He asked as he turned to lock the car.\n\n“Saul,”\n\nThe man paused, looking shocked, “Hoffman?” A strange expression began to form on his face. Possibly anger.\n\n“Um, yeah,” I said, confused by his sudden aggression.\n\n“I knew I recognized you,” He said, a scowl settling on his face.\n\n“I’m sorry?”\n\n“No wonder he’s chasing you. After all the shit your parents did,” He spoke as he opened his car door, getting back inside.\n\n“What?” I rushed over as he slammed the door shut, “You can’t just leave! What are you talking about?!” Not again. I couldn’t have my chance at getting answers just run away *again*.\n\nAt that he smiled. A shallow, vindictive smile. He rolled down the car window, just a crack, “They never told you?”\n\n“Told me what?! Nobody’s told me anything!”\n\nHe started the car, forcing him to speak above the engine, “Well, your father’s going to have a fun time explaining all of this to you. What did they say when you had to move away?”\n\nIt took me a moment to find my answer. I wasn’t expecting *that* to be brought into this, “They said it was for school,”\n\nHe chuckled and shook his head to himself, “What a load of bullshit,” He said as he backed out of the parking space, “They didn’t want you to know what they did,” He called out before driving off.\n\nI stood there, baffled. I’d just driven twenty minutes with this guy to be blown off for some obscure reason. Ridiculous. And incredibly annoying. What the fuck was he even talking about? I still didn’t even know who he was, but apparently he hated me. Or, he hated my parents. Eventually I went inside, angry and confused. The first thing I did when I sat down was pull out my phone and call my dad.\n\nThe phone rang for a few moments before he answered, “Saul? Is something wrong?”\n\n“Yeah. Just met some guy that seems to hate me over something you and mom did,” I waited for him to speak, but he never did, “Did you guys do something?”\n\nHe was silent again for a long time, and I almost thought he wasn’t going to respond. The tone of his voice was simultaneously laced with guilt and anger, “Gideon has reasons to hate me… but he’s not innocent himself,”\n\nI waited for him to continue, but he didn’t, “What did you do?”\n\nHe took a deep breath, “I assume you’ve gone into my room. This falls into the category of things that I can’t talk about,”\n\nI clenched my jaw and tried to regulate my temper. That contract was protecting me, but it was also a massive thorn in my side. I couldn’t do anything for my situation without information\n\n“All I can say is that we sent you to Brynn so you wouldn’t be affected by it all,”\n\nI buried my face into my hands, already done with the conversation. Anytime anyone said anything relevant to what was going on, they made the situation more confusing. I just wanted this to stop. Anything to make it stop. My father’s muffled voice from the phone brought my attention back.\n\n“Just stay away from Gideon. He’s not a good person,” He said seriously, “Now, are you sure you’re okay? Did something happen?”\n\n“Yeah, I’m great,” I contemplated for a moment whether I should even bother recounting what happened, “That thing ran me off the road. The car’s a bit scratched up but that’s about it—” Just then, someone put down a plate in front of me. I looked up at Maddie, who looked very clearly concerned at what she’d overheard. I only continued once she’d left, “And Gideon did something weird. He passed by me on the road and stopped to see if I was hurt. And,” I glanced outside, unnerved by the memory, “And— *it* attacked him. But, he said something and it backed off. And, he said something weird. He said that it was ‘his biggest regret,’”\n\nMy dad cleared his throat, “It would be concerning if Gideon didn’t regret his decisions,” The vagueness of the comment was irritating, but it was likely all he could give.\n\nAnyways, the rest of the day isn’t all that important compared to what happened at night. The rest of my call with dad didn’t yield any more information. I explained to Maddie that an animal had run in front of my car, but nothing serious happened. After a few hours of moping and simmering down, the café was beginning to close. I reluctantly made my way back to my car and started driving. Nothing seemed to be following me, though it was difficult to tell once the sun had set. The peaceful drive was misleading. I reached my house without issue, didn’t feel watched or anything, and eventually went to sleep.\n\nThe nightmare came out of left field. I was back at the lake, but things were different. Namely, instead of staring at the water, I was under it. There was a split second of shock before the panic set in. The lake seemed deeper than it should’ve been, the surface a million miles away. My lungs burned as I kicked and thrashed around, desperately trying to find an escape. Fear coursed through every inch of my body. Panic and the urge to take a breath were the only two things occupying my mind. I must’ve only been under for around two to three minutes, but each second was an agonizing eternity. My fear never once wavered, even as my movements began to slow. Eventually, I inhaled water. Once, then twice. And when my vision darkened, I stopped counting. And the worst part of that nightmare is that I knew it was not my own, nor was it a work of fiction. It was a memory.\n\nI woke up in a cold sweat, unable to see in the darkness and my body shaking. Something was wrong. I still couldn’t breathe. Something was pressing down on my chest, making it nearly impossible to take a breath. However, as something ran down my cheek, I became aware that there was some sort of liquid filling my lungs. At first I reached towards my face, my hand touching whatever was coming out of my mouth. Not natural— it was something warm and viscous. As I moved to sit up and get rid of whatever was on my chest, a coarse hand held my head down. My head ached as my body fought to breathe, but underneath all of that chaos was one, clear message. One word being repeated over and over. One name.\n\n*Mike*\n\nI knew immediately where I recognized it from, but my brain didn’t process it in that moment. All it could think of was getting out of this situation. It was so hard to think and was getting progressively harder to move. Lifting my arm to fight off whoever was holding me down took far more effort than it should’ve. My muscles ached and my bones felt impossibly heavy. I gagged and coughed up some of the liquid in my throat, but it didn't help. I gripped the arm holding down my head and tried to shove it away, painfully aware of how feeble my attempts were. Under my hand was dust of some sort, which I could later recognize as ash, covering the person’s cracked and rough skin. It was then that my brain vaguely recalled who, or what, was holding me down. That fact played little part in the horror I already felt. I was certain I was going to die. Darkness crept into my consciousness and I could feel myself slipping away. My arm dropped back down to my side, lacking the energy needed to continue functioning properly.\n\nI don’t remember when it left, only that I fell off of my bed. I was barely aware of the pain that the fall caused. Then I threw up. I hardly had the energy to lift my head more than a couple inches above the floor; it felt like trying to lift a bowling ball with my pinky. I lost count of how many times I threw up. Just that there was an impossible amount of whatever that liquid was. Absolutely everything hurt, including every inch of my brain. Everything is really blurry from that time. I passed out at some point, waking up in the same place I’d been before.\n\nI lied there for who knows how long, processing everything that had happened. Sunlight shone through the crack in the curtains, illuminating the floor beneath me. The only remnants of whatever I’d thrown up last night were the traces of a dark black substance between the floorboards. Everything still ached. I stayed there for what must’ve been hours, eventually breaking down and crying. Sobbing, really. The gasping for air was painful, but I couldn’t stop.\n\nIt took a very long time, but I was eventually able to collect myself. I got up off the floor, changed, then washed my face.\n\nI don’t think I’m going to survive this thing. There are still so many unknowns about it and it clearly doesn’t like me. It could’ve killed me last night. It chose not to. It wants me to suffer, I’m sure of it. I’m honestly too overwhelmed right now to think. I spent hours just processing what had happened that night before finally grabbing my phone and writing this all out. I decided that, if I die tonight, it might as well not remain a mystery.\n\nLet it be known that, whatever happens to me, it was Mike. Mike. The name of my old imaginary friend. I don’t know what happened to him, or why he is what he is now. But I now know it’s Mike.\n\nIf I survive, or find any information, I’ll be back to update you guys.",

        "text": "I want to share this knowledge to you guys on nosleep, because I noticed that there are a few stories from the members of this subreddit that remind me about the feeling and character of a \"Kaidan\".\n\nSo what is \"Kaidan\"?\n\nYou can understand it as \"strange stories\" in Japanese, but this one are not describe as the original meaning.\n\n\"Kaidan\" are bizarre, horror and terrifying events, they happen when one (sometime it take more than one person) reaches a certain condition (these conditions are not fixed and are not the same).\n\nThe chances to one encountering Kaidan are very low, but there are paranormal research organizations that already organize hunting units and actively seeking for Kaidan. They have equipment like the Kaidan detection radar, which can detect the spatial wavelengths that Kaidan leaves behind as they floats between the boundaries of our world. \n\nKaidan can \"float\" aimlessly, without an anchor until you meet a condition that activates them. Sometimes they stay in one place, waiting for an unlucky one to enter their realm. It can look just like our real world or taken place as something far from what we've ever seen. \n\nIn some cases, Kaidan remains in contact with our world after someone enters, which leads to the same result where people can still communicate via phone or access the internet, like in the case of \"Kisaragi Station\", which I believe is also a Kaidan.\n\nSometimes ordinary people discover Kaidan's existence and organize their own Kaidan Hunting groups. For unknown reason, they became sensitive to Kaidan's existence and coordinate, which, according to my grandfather, is like Kaidan are inviting them into their world.\n\nMy grandfather's experience after many years of working in a Kaidan Hunting team has been boiled down to 3 rules:\n\n#1: Every kaidan has its own rules, which is equally binding on both \"them\" and us. The only way to survive is to find out how the Kaidan works.\n\nFor example, a kaidan where you are hunted by a monster in a dilapidated building, you accidentally discover that it cannot attack you when your back is touching a surface. It is right in front of you but cannot attack you, because it is also under the authority of the Kaidan rule. You just keep your back to the wall, even crawling backwards on the floor until you exit the building and return to the real world.\n\nBut there are always exception.\n\nIf you're in a Kaidan with the only rule is \"dont look benind\". How can you find out about it? The first thing a human will do when they enter a strange place is to look around to have a sight of what's around. This will lead you to demise instantly. The only way to survive in this case is when you have a \"companion\" who will look around, triggering Kaidan's rule. Their deaths will give you a clue as to how this Kaidan works.\n\nBut these still just the easiest kind of Kaidan, since there are those that have more than 1 rules, even 7-8 rules.\n\n\n#2: Try to avoid conflicts with \"people\".\n\nSometimes a Kaidan will be role-playing mini-world, which means there will be \"NPCs\" and plot. \n\nThese NPCs act like normal humans in Kaidan's world, their existence having a significant effect on the fulfillment of your \"role\" as well as driving the plot forward. They are directly related to your survival, so be careful when dealing with them if you can.\n\n#3: Don't try to fight \"them\" with the stuff from our world.\n\nLike I said, Kaidan's existence has the nature of a mini-world, they have their own rules, and this also includes objects.\n\nObjects from our world cannot deal damage to objects in Kaidan.\n\nYeah, your AR-15 won't leave a scratch on the monster's head, im sorry. But it can be kill with a hand knife or something you get randomly around the place (you can get hurt, so be careful). If you want to fight back, try to find a weapon around the Kaidan's realm.\n\n***\n\nI don't think this information can affect our world or your lives, because like I said, the odds of encountering a Kaidan are very low.\n\nBut be careful with your actions if you intend to dig into Kaidan's existence.\n\nIf you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you.",

        "text": "If you are reading this more than a day after it was posted, chances are that I am dead. My entire family is dead as I'm writing this, but someone needs to know.\n\nThis might sound strange to most of you, but it has been heavily snowing for a fortnight at this point and I can't be sure if it has stopped, because my entire house is buried.\n\nMe and my family got the supposedly false EAS alert that it would be snowing for an undetermined about of time around Christmas, and we determined that we should stock up on food and water before the snow started, just in case it was real, because it sounded like a hacker was messing with people. If it wasn't for that alert, I wouldn't be able to write this.\n\nWe managed to stock up with no issues and everyone in my family took the next month off of work. My job wouldn't let me do that so I simply quit. We were always the superstitious family in the neighborhood, and nobody took it seriously except for us.\n\nThen it started to snow.\n\nAfter the second full day of snow, we were laughing at the TV as people were raiding the local Cub and Hy-vee, but it was more of a worried laugh, because there were also reports of home break-ins and people knew that we were the people who always took this stuff seriously. It was only a matter of time before we were raided.\n\nThe next day we heard what we thought was friendly knocking on the door, and my little brother was weirdly dumb and opened the door. He never did that. He always went and got someone else to open it.\n\nA Gunshot. Everyone heard it. And as we turned the corner into the living room, we saw my little brother dead on the floor, completely decapitated by the shotgun round. He was 5. A bundled figure was standing next to him, holding a clipboard and a shotgun. He checked something off and held the shotgun up at my paralyzed sister and pulled the trigger. She fell to the ground next to me.\n\nI pulled myself out of my shock and raced upstairs to get my dad's desert eagle. He always had it loaded In case of something like this. I grabbed the gun and went back downstairs and saw my parents dead as well. I was so caught up with my thoughts at the time that I didn't hear the gunshots. The man was in the kitchen getting food and water from our fridge. He didn't hear me come downstairs.\n\nI did something that I thought only happened in movies. I announced my presence. I wanted that fucker to see who was going to kill him. He turned around, but didn't have his gun. He had left it on the couch because I was \"hiding\" I presume. He took off his scarf and revealed who he was, probably because he knew I knew him and hoped that I wouldn't bring myself to kill him.\n\nIt was my 4th grade teacher, Mr. Terry. He was the one who *actually* taught me to be myself. \n\nHe was so nice. I wish I didn't have to kill him. Recently I have been losing sleep because he meant so much to me.\n\nI shot him directly between the eyes. It's engrained in my memory, the terror in his eyes, him begging my not to kill him... His limp body falling to the floor...\n\nI need a moment.\n\nOkay, glad to see my phone is still alive. I have been trying my hardest not to cry while writing this, but the memories of Mr Terry came flooding back and it was too much. He was important to me.\n\nThat was only the third day. Since then I have buried all of my family outside in the snow. And Mr Terry was recovered by an anonymous person after I was asleep. They took nothing else, Just his body.\n\nI've been running out of food for a while now, and I just ate the last of my canned goods today. I do have another option, but I'm not sure if I could bring myself to do it. From what I understand, people are stranded in the place where the internet is regulated, so that's how I can write this. Im not sure how much longer it will last, though...\n\nI will update if I bring myself to eat the bodies of my family I put outside. Probably not though. Cannibalism always makes me squeamish.\n\ngoodbye.",

        "author": "ch-4-os",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1070afm/i_used_to_love_the_rules_completion/",
        "text": "[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103nhta/i_used_to_love_the_rules/)\n\n It's been a few days since I posted my experiences with The Rules. I appreciate your suggestions and your conclusions. Here's what's been happening since then.   \n\n\n  I made index cards with the rules on them to carry in my wallet just in case, even though I've got them memorized already. It's easier to remember things when you don't know what happens if you forget, you know? I've even been ending texts with two periods, just in case..   \n\n\n  I kept thinking about the couple of comments which suggested that I should ignore the rules and that maybe it was a mental issue on my part rather than something supernatural like in the stories. At first, I was offended that people would suggest either of those things. After a while, though, I realized that they had a point. I did need to know whether or not this was really real..     \n\n\n  I looked at the rules and decided that the safest set to test out was probably the set in my home. After a little more thought, I decided to not set that extra place at dinner. So, I cooked up some stir-fry and then sat down to eat, all by myself, with only my plate on the table. It was a little odd not to see that second setting and by the time I was half way done with my meal, the desire to get up and set that second place was almost uncontrollable. I fought through it and gulped down the last few bites as quickly as I could without choking, feeling proud that I won..     \n\n\n  I tidied up, did the dishes, and finished out my evening. I only had to spin once, which was a relief because the bell tolled three times the other night. (I was just glad it tolled when I was in my living room and could collapse onto my couch because I was so dizzy that I could barely stand.) I grabbed my phone, knocked, and headed into the bathroom to do my toilette, making sure to keep my eyes on my phone the whole time since it was after dark, and then headed into my bedroom. I looked back into the kitchen as I knocked just to make sure that everything was right and the block was still under the window. Satisfied that I had followed every other rule, I climbed into bed and pulled up reddit to read for a while until I fell asleep. I heard a noise right before I fell asleep and almost got up to check it until I realized that what I heard was three light knocks so I stayed put..   \n\n\n  The next morning, I slept late because the Breather had woken me up and it's really hard to fall back to sleep with the blanket over my head and someone breathing in my room. I woke up and stretched before going over the rule cards that I kept in my room now. It was amazing how quickly glancing at them had become a morning routine like brushing my teeth. I slid out of bed and went to the bathroom, knocking quietly on each door frame of course, and looked up at the ceiling just for fun because I could. I was feeling happy and cheerful until I walked into the kitchen area and saw that two of my bananas had turned black there in my fruit bowl. I stopped dead in my tracks and gasped as tears sprang to my eyes. It was real. It was all real..     \n\n\n  “I'm so sorry,” I choked out through my tears, “I'll obey. I will.” I hoped that whomever had put these rules in place believed in second chances. I stood in place as I took deep breaths and calmed myself down. I took a few minutes to collect myself and then I pulled out my phone to take another piece of advice y'all gave me. I texted my landlord to see if he would stop by my place and literally pumped my fist when he texted back that he would be by at 3. I looked at the clock, did some math, and decided to use my day to find out more about my situation. I was scared, but I've seen enough movies to know that there might be a solution..   \n\n\n  I started by heading down to the cute little coffee shop down the block. It was within walking distance but getting there took some extra time because I went ahead and made sure I didn't turn the same direction twice in a row. Better safe than sorry, right? When I got there, I got my coffee flavored sugar milk and sat down to do some googling. I wanted to see if there was anything strange in the history of my apartment complex – there wasn't. Next, I checked to see if there was any information about The Rules which wasn't on Reddit – there wasn't. So, I finished my drink, packed up my stuff, and headed out to the library. This trip was a little easier since the way there was a straight shot and I made sure to cross the street right in front of the library so I only had to make one right turn..     \n\n\n  I knocked discreetly when I walked through the door and turned to go to the desk. Within seconds of my second turn, I heard horns blaring, tires screeching, and someone yelling. I froze. I spun around and ran back to the door, making sure to knock as I ducked through it. Two cars had collided and it was my fault. It looked like no one was hurt, though both parties were going to need a lot of body work on their cars, which was good, but I had to be more careful from now on..     \n\n\n  Navigating through the library was stressful because I had to keep careful track of the turns I took as I looked through the supernatural/occult section while watching the clock to make sure I didn't miss holding my breath; I was using my days out of the office to get into the habit of following the rules there as well. I pulled a few books but there was nothing helpful in them. I went to the psychological section and pulled out the DSM and a few other books in which I thought I'd find information about OCD. None of them said anything about real consequences of breaking the compulsions, only that people imagine things going wrong as a result, so I realized that it really was happening..   \n\n\n  I didn't repeat my mistake on the way home, paying very close attention to my turns. It was a stroke of luck, though, because I found myself distracted by cars passing with loud music or drivers with food in their hands. I couldn't help but wonder if bad things were going to happen to them or if they were safe because they didn't know the rules. Maybe ignorance really was bliss..     \n\n\n  As I walked home, I found myself counting each turn. This way, I knew that if I was on an even number, I had to turn left and an odd number meant a right turn. Happy to have solved at least one problem, I knocked on the door of my complex and headed to my apartment to wait for my landlord.   I had planned to be sneaky about it and ask him if he could find a stud so I could hang a picture in the spot where The Rules were hanging but I decided to just ask outright since I knew it was not all in my head..     \n  \n\nI had just finished spinning when I heard two knocks on the door. I caught my breath and went to greet my landlord who walked in with a smile. When he asked me if everything was okay, I asked him if anyone else had broken the rules. He tilted his head to the side and asked me what I was talking about..   \n\n\n“You know, The Rules of the house,” I remember saying, “Has anyone ever broken them and, if so, what happened?..”   \n  “Oh,” he exclaimed, “I get it. If someone breaks the lease agreement, I give them a warning and then evict them if they continue to do the wrong thing. It's happened a time or two..”   \n  “No. Not the lease. The RULES.” I was a little annoyed, “You know, don't look at the Watcher and set a plate out at every meal.” I pointed to the framed list held up the index cards, “Those rules..”   \n  I must have been more agitated than I thought because he took a step back and held up his hands, “Listen, I don't care what kind of rules you go by while you're living here as long as your TV is turned down during quiet hours and I don't have any property damage. Now, if you'll excuse me.” With that, he ducked through my door and into the hallway..   \n\n\nI was stunned. He didn't know what I was talking about. He thought I had made the rules up myself. And then I panicked: what if he was stealthily giving me more rules? I grabbed a pen and wrote **Turn down the TV during quiet hours** and **No property damage** on the index card for the house..   \n\n  \n  That night was a rough night for me. It felt like The Rules were testing me after my two failures during the day. The bell tolled and, while I was spinning, I felt myself being watched so I had to close my eyes so I didn't look in the wrong place. Later, almost as soon as I got into bed, I heard breathing in the corner so I had to cover my head for the whole night which was the worst. Thankfully, I had my phone in my hand when I heard it, so I had something to distract me. I can't tell you how glad I am that there are no technology related rules.. \n\n  \n  The next morning, I knew that I had to do something. All of the people in the world were breaking these rules and risking terrible things and they didn't even know it. It was terrifying and tragic all at once. So, I made copies of The Rules. I typed them up and printed them out on clean white paper: there was no place to buy parchment anywhere near my place. I folded them up and put them in envelopes which I slipped under the door at each apartment in my complex as I walked out to spread the word and keep people safe..   \n\n  \n  I also added a rule: Learn to love [The Rules](https://www.reddit.com/user/ch-4-os/comments/105zuch/the_rules/) ..",

I even tried smashing the front door, but the glass was reinforced. I'd walked through it enough times to know that.\n\nWith no way out, I decided to explore. What else is a man supposed to do? I had always been curious, but I was never allowed into the board meetings with sharp executives. I was only ever indulged in grunt work, much to my annoyance.\n\nAll the corridors looked the same. I must've wandered for at least twenty minutes before I heard it. Footsteps. My heart is filled with hope. Someone else was stuck in here. Maybe they were a technician who knew how to work the lock. At the very least, I could chinwag with someone until morning. I could only see the thing's chest at first. \n\nIt was tall, impossibly so. I dove backwards and flattened myself against the wall, hoping to God that the thing would simply walk past me. I looked up; its neck was cocked to one side, obviously unable to fit into the room. It was smooth and bleach white; its footsteps were slow and shambling. Its skin vibrated with a low hum, and as it got closer, it seemed to be...breathing? The whole of the thing buzzed with the unmistakable rhythm of breath. \n\nThankfully, it didn't seem to notice my presence; it awkwardly shuffled past me seeming to be in some kind of stupor. It moaned as someone might when half asleep, barely cognizant. I didn't want to think about what it could do had it been slightly more intelligent, though I would soon see. \n\nI, against all good grace of rational thought, decided to keep moving deeper into the facility. A few left and right turns later, my descent into hell was marked by frigid cold. I could see my breath ahead of me; my hands started to shake barely a few steps into the journey. It was definitely far below zero here. \n\nJust as warmth began to escape my limbs, the cavernous room  ahead promised a slight increase in temperature, enough to stave off hypothermia. I collapsed at the entrance to a plastic prison, beset on all sides by foreign machines with unknown purposes. \n\nAlong the right hand wall were transparent cells filled with much the same creature that I had seen at the start of my journey. They lay dormant; the cold probably kept them sleeping, though the characteristic twinge of life was still there. I could get a closer look at these creatures, far more overwhelmed by morbid curiosity than fear. \n\nThe thing was curled in a fetal position on the floor of its cell. It was motionless save for the hum and was altogether humanoid, though much larger than any human ought to have been. Instead of discernable eyes, the thing has black, vacant holes, which seemed to be entrenched all the way back into its skull. I decided to move on, the mere sight of the creature made me violently ill, and I had no intention of slowing down tonight. However, as I manoeuvred past the other cells, more of the creatures caught my eye. There was some minor difference, or rather a deformity, in each. Some had arms bent at odd angles, others had transparent skin. A subject that particularly disturbed me was one covered from head to toe in human eyes, which stared glassily at me from inside the cell. They did not see me, but their gaze was unnerving all the same. \n\nI moved through the door at the end of the long passage and came upon a CCTV surveillance centre. There must have been at lease 50 cameras in all areas of the facility, constantly active and silently observing. Upon the desk, just in front of the camera controls, was a large ringed binder. I took a few pages of it, whomever finds my letter should find it as well. Needless to say, this has been going on for a long while and the manufacturing of these abominations is only increasing. To what end they are brought into existance I cannot say, perhaps just a simple act of playing god or at worst a manufactured army. \n\nAs I turned to leave, I made what would prove to be the first of two incalculable errors. Having absorbed the horrible information, my feet dragged with the weight of it and, as I stumbled, my arm connected with a control panel. I heard the mechanical hiss of a lock mechanism releasing. I peered from outside the door and saw that I had opened one of the cells. The many eyed monster had awoken, its rake like fingers clasped the frames of the prison as it pulled itself upright. I hid, peeking through the small window attached to the top of the security door. The eyes moved rapidly in all directions, searching the room with alarming frequency. Once satisfied nothing was in it's presence, the ghoul shuffled back into its cell, giving me the perfect opportunity to escape.\n\nI was almost past the cell, I could not feel the devil stir but, in a moment of stupid curiosity, I looked back. And there I was met with several of the eyes locked with mine. Almost as soon as I had registered them, great chasms split along the creature, filled with blackened teeth. A thousand faces writhed and screamed, stirring the body that contained them to lash out with one of it's ghastly extremities. My left side was shredded by its claws, they moved through me as if I were just thin air. As I ran, the other creatures pounded their fists, heads and entire bodies onto the glass, ravanous at the smell of fresh blood. \n\nAnd it is here that I am writing. I'm hidden in a nearby lab, my head feels fuzzy, I'm sure that I'm going to die. I'm losing a lot of blood, my fingers have stopped working. \n\nI hear it, it's close. Please god, help me.",

        "text": "My family likes to travel, and when I say travel I don’t mean sunny tourist spots like Aruba or Florida. When we travel, we travel for real. We’ve white-water rafted in the Himalayas, tracked big game all over Africa, and even fished for Piranhas in the Amazon.\n\nI am the youngest of 3, with two older sisters and happily married parents. Like most families, we fight for space in the car, argue constantly, and get lost wherever we go. I used to find them incredibly irritating but now, I would give anything for one more trip with my dad at the wheel and my sister pinching me because I sat on her sweatshirt.\n\nOur last trip was our biggest one yet, a 3-week excursion to Uganda and Rwanda, filled with safaris, gorilla tracking, and plenty of hiking. The entire trip was planned for almost a year and stepping foot off the plane into Uganda felt surreal. The first half of our trip uncharacteristically went off without a hitch. We made all of our reservations in time, unleashed our inner Jane Goodall sitting with Gorillas and everyone was in high spirits when we started our drive to Rwanda. Halfway there and we received a call from our upcoming hotel, they had overbooked and we were being moved to a “brand new” lodge just up the road. Not a big deal we thought, as we crossed the border.\n\nThe lodge was not in fact “just up the road”, it took us well over 3 hours to find the road, and after much backtracking and yelling we finally reached it just as dusk was settling. We hadn’t seen another building for ages but there was still a gate with a shabby attendant waiting for us. He waved us in and we pulled up the long road to the lodge, I turned back to watch the attendant follow our car after closing the gate. \n\nWe reached the entrance to the lodge and who was there to greet us but the same attendant, strange because he had just been behind us on the road but I assumed he had taken a shortcut through the woods.\n\n“Welcome to Agrandi safari lodge, I like your stay here to be comfortable”. We thanked him as he took our bags and led us inside the main lobby a shabby room with a front desk, a small door behind it, and a fireplace in the middle of the room. He hurried behind the counter and signed us in. “Have 2 rooms, one double and triple”.  My dad chirped “Nothing like sharing a room for some sibling bonding!” I rolled my eyes as we followed the attendant to the room.\n\nThe room looked like it had been designed by the 70’s worst architect. The walls were covered in fake and cracked plaster rocks, a fireplace sat derelict in the corner and the bathroom was like something out of a colorblind kid's coloring book. There was a tiny bathtub painted bright orange with a cracked mirror above it, a shower painted an unsettling shade of blue, a leaking toilet, and a sink that only dribbled out brownish water. As the attendant was showing us how to lock the door my sister opened the large shades to let a little light in, the view was nothing but the back of another building. The attendant hurried over to close the shades, “don’t want these open now, yes?”, we were confused but nodded our heads so he would leave the room as we were eager to lay down after the long drive. “Dinner 8:30, don’t be late,” he said with a wink as he closed our door. \n\n“This room is shit for a supposedly brand-new hotel,” my sister said. I chucked a water bottle at her “stop complaining hoe, I my beauty sleep, wake me up for dinner” I said as I closed my eyes. The bed felt like laying on a pile of potatoes but I still fell asleep quickly.\n\nI awoke to a pitch-dark room, fumbled for my phone, and checked the time. “8:45, fuck. Why did I think they would wake me up?” I heard the shower running in the bathroom jumped up and knocked on the door. “It’s 8:45, we’re late for dinner, why didn't you wake me up!” No response. “Fuck her,” I thought and left the room to head to dinner. It was then I realized that I had no clue where “dinner” actually was. \n\nI wandered around the lodge area and got a general understanding of the layout. Other than the main lobby there were three other buildings, two of them being the rooms my family was staying in and one I assumed to be where the workers slept. I wandered back to the main lobby to ask for help but it was empty, however, there was a door behind the desk ajar and I could hear quiet conversation behind it. I peeked through and saw a small dining room and most of my family eating at a table. \n\nMy stomach rumbled as I walked through the door, my family stopping their talk and looking at me as I sat down. “Why are you late?” my mom said with a frown. I shrugged “blame it on them they didn't wake me up,” I said pointing at my sisters. “Wait wasn't one of you in the shower?” They shrugged and said nothing.  “Where’s dad?” I asked my mother. “Your father isn't well, he won't be coming to dinner” my dad has never been the healthiest so I wasn’t surprised. \n\nI heard rustling behind me and saw the same man who opened the gate and checked us in wearing a ridiculously small chef's hat. “Dinner no longer served, sorry”. I stood up “What the fuck? First off are you the only worker here and I'm only 15 minutes late. What is your kitchen on a fucking egg timer?!” I rarely raise my voice but I chop that outburst up to a mix of hunger and the shitty bed I slept in. The attendant was unmoved “Don’t worry you didn't miss entertainment, children from orphanage come sing for you soon”. \n\nThis had happened before to us in Uganda, a bunch of kids come to sing and dance for donations. A fully uncomfortable experience where you sit with a fake smile on your face for 15 minutes and wait for the end so you can give them 20 bucks to split between 30 kids who don’t even have shoes. “Fuck this” I growled “I don't want to hear a bunch of kids with no parents come sing and I feel like shit”, I pushed by the worker and headed back to my room as a sudden headache came over me.\n\nWalking out of the lobby I noticed just how dark it was outside. There were no outdoor lights and the lobby was lit up only by a fire.I turned on my phone flashlight and returned to my room, feeling immensely tired, hungry, and a little embarrassed about dissing orphans. I groggily brushed my teeth and got into bed happy the bathroom was no longer making noises. Just as I was drifting asleep I heard kids' voices and singing. My anger at the orphans was renewed as I fumbled in the dark for some earplugs and crashed back into my bed. \n\nI don’t remember falling asleep, although who does to begin with but I awoke to the sound of singing. An earplug had fallen out, I checked my phone, 02:17, “alright fuck these orphans” I grumbled. I looked over to my older sister's bed, she wasn’t there and a glance in the other direction confirmed my other sister was gone as well. I checked the bathroom, the lights wouldn’t turn on but I knew they weren’t in there. Considering we were getting up early for a hike in just a few hours I was beyond confused and decided to go back to the lobby to see what was going on. I groggily slipped on shoes and a shirt then ventured outside.\n\nIt was drizzling outside and I could hear the singing coming from the lobby. I hurried over and saw my mom and sisters sitting by the fire but no kids, my family didn't even acknowledge my entering. It was then I noticed that the singing was coming from speakers by the desk and that my family all had this same glassy-eyed look on their faces. I coughed and none of them moved, then I yelled, then I grabbed my older sister. Nothing, I was getting a little worried now, I walked up to my mom and asked if she was okay. Nothing, I was tired of whatever joke they were playing and pushed my younger sister on the way as I headed back to my room, she toppled over like a bag of bricks. Concerned I tried to lift her back but I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye. The attendant appeared to be sneaking up behind me with a rag in his hand. \n\n“What did you do to my family” I demanded. He said nothing and smiled, I am 21 years old and stand at just over 6 ft, I try not to get scared at much but just one look at that smile and I was out the door running back to my room. I could hear steps behind me as I ran, and I slammed the door behind me and locked it. \n\nBreathing heavily I noticed the light was on in the bathroom and heard the sound of the shower running. I grabbed the fire poker from the fireplace and walked over slowly pushing the door open. My dad was crumpled up on the floor of the shower, clothes still on and face down, a red stream flowing out of him and down the drain. I dropped the poker and rushed over,  I grabbed his head to roll him over and that’s when I saw. His face was in tatters like he had been half eaten by an animal and he wasn't breathing. I dry-heaved as my vision went blurry and then black. \n\nI woke up on the bathroom floor, my dad's body still in the shower next to me. I knew I needed to call the police but on account of being in Africa, I had no service on my phone. I had seen a phone in the lobby but was terrified of going back there. I slapped myself and told myself my family was in danger and they needed my help. Leaving the bathroom I saw light through the shades, my stomach dropped, I had passed out through the night I thought. I opened the shade and instead of sunlight, I was greeted by hundreds of what looked like flashlights shining into my room moving as if held by hundreds of hands. I ripped the shades closed and turned around. I was breathing heavily and staring at the wall to calm down. That’s when I saw, the cheap plaster rocks looked a lot like faces and they were dripping a dark liquid. I didn’t even need to look closer, I knew it was blood, this place was beyond fucked. All of the sudden the lights outside the window turned off. \n\nI do not consider myself a brave person but at that moment a wave of calm realization came over me and I had two goals, get to that phone and fuck up anyone that gets in my way. I peeked out the front door and saw nothing but darkness, with the dim light from the fire in the lobby flickering in the distance. I swallowed the spit building in my mouth I made a mad dash for the lobby.\n\nThe lobby was silent other than the crackling fire, my family members were gone but the door to the dining area was ajar. I crept my way in and the room felt smaller than before, as if the walls had closed in, and indeed they had. The shapes of bodies were pushing out from the wall, faces pressed against the plaster as if it were a plastic bag suffocating their faces, my family's faces. I ran up to the plaster knowing it takes hours to dry but it was harder than a rock. I grabbed a chair and slammed it against the encased body of my mother to no avail. I punch the wall until my hand was bloody and screamed for help. All of the sudden there was a thud behind me.  I turned to see the attendant with a trowel in one hand and a dropped plaster bucket in the other.\n\n“You fucking bastard” I whispered, he did nothing but stare at me. I felt like a character from a cartoon who gets so angry that steam comes out of his ears. I grabbed the closest thing to a weapon I could, a dinky fork, and charged him. He smiled and charged back leaning down his shoulder to make a football-like tackle. I sidestepped, stabbing him in the neck with the fork. He stumbled allowing me to land a swift kick on his ass and ran into the lobby looking for a new weapon. He followed me, “no running, time for you to help build” he sputtered out. I grabbed a piece of half-burnt wood from the fire and swung it in front of him. All he did was stare at the fire, saying nothing. I didn’t hesitate and clocked that fucker straight in the face with the burning end of the log. He slowly turned his gaze toward me but didn’t move. It was like he was looking through me, and he was.\n\nI felt the heat on my back realizing that the chair behind me was on fire. “Shit, shit, shit” the fire was already spreading to the next chair over, there was no water around and my attempts to smother the growing flames were futile. The speakers sputtered back on with a garbled version of the kids singing and my head started throbbing harder than a gas station boner pill. My vision started blurring as I stumbled outside, crashing down onto the grass. I watched the attendant calmly arrange the front desk even as the fire began licking at his feet. The last image I remember was just a little smile on his face as his pants caught on fire. \n\nI woke up to rain pattering on my face, sitting up I saw the burnt-up husk of the lobby in front of me. My head hurt like I was hungover and I coughed up a glob of black spit. I ran over to the rubble and started tearing through it, only stopping when I saw the burnt bodies of my family. I barely stayed upright but I was snapped back to reality when I realized the attendants body was not among the rubble. \n\nI was overtaken by the feeling that I needed to leave that forsaken place and first needed my wallet and passport. I practically crawled back to my room, stumbling through the door. The room was almost peaceful, my sisters beds still made, the walls no longer looking like faces and were back the same fake rocks. I peeked into the bathroom, my dad's body was gone, but there was still blood by the drain. I frantically searched for my passport and wallet to no avail. The urge to leave was overpowering at this point, I ran out of that room and down the road. The fence at the entrance was open and I bolted through, never looking back.\n\nI still don’t know what to do. I can’t go to the police, I started that fire killing my family no matter the situation. I have no way to leave the country and I stand out like a sore thumb here. I’ve been getting by going to hotels and pretending to be a guest, stealing the bear necessities but that can only last so long. I wonder how things are back home, if my house has been sold and if people held a funeral for me and my family. I still have one hope, that maybe my father still lives and I can find him but I don’t know if I could ever face him again after what happened. Either way, at least I’m alive and not a part of that damn hotel.",

        "text": "Mr Alfred Glynt had, truly, been an exceptional host. And, as we all sat around the dinner table, dressed in white tie and finishing off an assortment of digestifs, I could not help but ponder on how spectacular the night had been.\n\nWas it the perfectly cut, perfectly cooked, medium rare Ribeye that I had devoured?\n\n Perhaps it was the exquisite red wine which had turned my awkward, mumbling self into a man that could exude some semblance of charm. \n\nOr, had it all in fact been Mr Alfred Glynt himself? -- for he had seen it all, and was able to transport me to and from the past and present with his conversational abilities.\n\nIndeed, while Mr Glynt now spent his twilight years acting as a consultant for small-town archeology firms across England, he had been a renowned archaeologist in his time. His highest, and most famed accomplishment, was his uncovering of the tomb of Saqqara, the resting place of King Unis (last of the fifth dynasty of Egyptian pharaohs). Hearing his tales on this particular matter was like getting lost in a book, or like reliving a memory that had never been yours.\n\nThe setting of our dinner certainly aided his storytelling, too. The walls to my left and right were adorned top to bottom with various artifacts that Mr Glynt had (presumably) dug up in Egypt. There were daggers, pots and various other fragments of memorabilia, forming in of themselves a miniature museum.\n\nBehind me, 4 sarcophagi casings. \n\nI had been assured earlier, by Mr Glynt himself, that these sarcophagi were in fact vacant of human remains. However, despite this knowledge, they did make me feel uneasy, like someone was watching the back of my head throughout the course of my meal.\n\nStill, it wasn't enough to spoil my mood. If anything, this all enhanced the experience of the night.\n\nMr Glynt was sitting directly opposite me, at the far end of an antiquated oak table. Behind him was a spectacular, marble mantelpiece. On it sat a plain white whale tusk, a ship in a bottle and a few photographs of, what I assume, was a young Mr Glynt on various archaeological digs and expeditions.\n\nAround the table itself, my work colleagues, who were taking turns in asking insightful questions of our gracious host, as they passed round the wine, sherry, and port. A truly marvelous evening.\n\nAnd that's when I spotted, on a rickety looking shelf above the mantel -- an ordinary looking book that caused me an unordinary sense of dread. \n\nIt was the colour of skin, looked to be bound by bone. On its center, an eye of Horus. It made me feel sick, yet ravenous, it filled my head with utter rage until my brain erupted and I felt calm again. What in the fuck is that? I thought to myself, as I began to feel dizzy.\n\nI wanted to cry. I wanted to scream. I relinquished and shot up, knocking over and smashing my empty glass. \n\n\"Fuck\" - I exclaimed, panting heavily. \n\n\"Mr May? Are you quite with us? Or has the sherry gone to your head?\" I was abruptly ousted from my brief moment of horror as Mr Glynt laughed from the head of the table.\n\nI took a moment to compose myself and averted my gaze from the book. I sheepishly replied.\n\n\"I do apologise Mr Glynt. I was just drawn to that odd looking book of yours on the mantelpiece\" (I gestured to it as i couldn't bear to look at it again) -- \"was it a find of yours\"?\n\nMr Glynt seemed to wince in pain at my question.\n\n\"Ah, erm, yes, you have a keen eye Mr May. That is a finding from the tomb of Saqqara itself. Now please, if you will, do try to ignore the book.\" He clicked his fingers twice before raising his voice. \"All of you, stay focussed on your drinks and do not listen to Mr May, for I haven't told you about the Boukoloi uprising of 171.\" He again, clicked his fingers twice and began to mumble, seeming to completely avert his eyes from me as if I were some lost cause. \n\nA very odd response, I thought, and it caught me so off guard that I felt like I had just been awoken from a long slumber.\n\nI looked around the room and, to my suprise, everyone was still feasting, and not in fact drinking the gorgeous sherry and port that I could have sworn had just been in their hands.\n\nUpon closer inspection, they were doing more than 'feasting'. \n\nI froze in horror as I witnessed my colleagues ripping the charred flesh off of one of our fellow colleagues; a woman that I knew well: our site director Estelle Maguire. For she lay, dead and cooked in the middle of the table. I could tell it was her though. Her head was perfectly preserved -- or, at least preserved enough that I was able to recognise her and the blue tatters of her dress were burned onto her skin.\n\nIn a manic moment, my eyes did not know where to look. I looked down at my plate, but saw hair, blood, bone and skin. I'm not ashamed to say that I vomited - and no one seemed to fucking notice.\n\nI jumped up once again, startled, not seeming to attract the attention of anyone around the table, for they were otherwise occupied in their devouring of an ex-colleague.\n\nMr Glynt continued, \"The people, called the Boukoloi, began a disturbance in Egypt. Under the leadership of a certain priest, they caused the rest of the Egyptians to revolt. At first, arrayed in women’s garments, they had deceived a Roman centurion, causing him to believe that they were women of the Boukoloi and were going to give him gold as ransom for their husbands.\"\n\nIn a spate of anger, I swept my hands across my immediate area of the table, sending even more glasses flying and shattering against the walls. I was in hell. \n\n\"Mr Glynt, what the fuck is going on!?\"\n\nBut my question was ignored, and his story continued.\n\n\"And this, my friends, is where the tale turns. For the Boukoloi struck the centurion down when he approached them. They sacrificed his companion, and after swearing an oath over his entrails, they devoured them both.\"\n\nI lost my shit. \"What the fuck is this. What the fuck is this. What the fuck is going on?\"\n\nMr Glynt finally acknowledged me, and so did the other guests who had stopped gnawing on medium rare skin. \n\n\"I do apologise Mr May, the book has brought you out of my trance, otherwise you'd be in bliss.\" \n\nMr May clicked his fingers once more and pointed to me. Like a well rehearsed play, the faces of my colleagues turned towards me in unison, each of them standing from their chairs. \n\nI looked at the far wall, I saw the fireplace. \n\nI looked left, and right, and I saw the ornaments covering the walls. \n\nIn a state of panic, I turned to see the 4 sarcophagi looking back at me. And that's when it struck me.\n\nWhere the fuck was the door.",

        "text": "LISTEN- This is my first reddit post on this account and my first attempt at making a r/nosleep story so sorry if it isnt very good, any feedback is great! \n\nThis Is An emergency message-Beeped my phone,constantly,This Is an emergency message. By now my entire family was getting their phones out to Look, confused, I opened up the message , a private number, which was oddly suspicious. We thought it was a joke at first , we all regret thinking that now.The message had a link to a website, so without thinking I clicked unknowingly of what would occur next, I waited, holding my breath for what was about to happen. Until it loaded; DO NOT LOOK UP, DO NOT LOOK OUTSIDE, DO NOT LEAVE YOUR HOUSE AND DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON My whole family waited in caution as I read it out loud, Shocked my uncle rushed to the window to see cars,windows,doors and ambulances crashed,smashed and altogether broken.His mouth widened with fear, as if he had saw something even worse. His wife rushed towards him shouting his name \" SHAWN, SHAWN , TALK TO ME\" Then she just stopped, mouth widened staring without movement nor blink. We were seriously worried now, I rushed to my bedroom closing the windows and blocking any entrances into my room.I ushered my family to do the same, when I finished I checked the message again and realised what it truly said \" DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON\" I scanned for the details or information or something that could help me understand what the hell was happening , but I couldn't. Me and the others regrouped in the kitchen as I read the sentence to them. My mother jumped in fear as the TV blurted on \"This Is an emergency broadcast-\" \"this is an emergen-\" \"Don't\" \"Look\" The television faded off and the electricity powered down we were in complete dark and had no idea what was happening. My mother reluctantly walked over to auntie and uncle and began to whimper in fear.\n\nMy father beckoned her to say what was wrong but she just stood there and began to cry \" They,\" They're\" \"They're eyes\" They\" They've melted\"  That's all she could whisper out before collapsing in shock My dad jogged towards her checking her pulse, \"she's alive\" a sigh of relief was let out as the family heard him. He stood up and checked my uncles face he jerked backwards after seeing it. He had no eyes and there were black tears running down his face he checked his sister in laws next the same had happened, grey veins emerged from their face which seemed to have gained the texture of stone.My dad once again checked mother's pulse and stopped \"utter silence\" was all that thrived in the dining room he broke out in tears before managing to whisper out \"she's\" \"she's gone\" he crouched there for hours, hours passed and he still crouched there crying.i went to look outside but my grandparents reminded me not to. I decided to look anyway but look straight down and not look up. I noticed it was still pitch black outside and the moons reflection  reflected on the house opposites window. There were people outside walking, slowly as if they didn't have a care in the world where they were going they looked lifeless,cold, they looked dead.\nI pulled the blinds down violently grabbed my dad by the shoulder of his coat and ran to my bedroom calling my grandparents names after me. When we were all inside I explained what I saw and everyone looked pale with sadness and horror of what was to come of this next.Hours passed I kept check  of time and made sure of the light outside it was still night time according to the stopwatch on my phone it has been 7 hours since it had all began I had tried texting people to ask if they had the same thing happening to them, but there was no signal nor Internet so I turned on my mobile data but still no use. An hour later after my grandparents had fallen asleep on my bed with my dad on the floor leaning against it drifting off to sleep.I heard a tap on the window, a cold spine-chilling tap.I went to check but heard mumbling and saw shadows slowly dance around the room.It sounded as if the front door had been kicked wide open as it smashed into the wall parallel to it.Creaks and footsteps were what I could hear the odd smash of a glass or ornament rarely a plate or bowl.I was to scared to open the door and peak through the small crack, I made sure it was locked and sat there in fear.\n\nA while later, footsteps-as if they were being dragged- pondered outside my door, the heavy breathing of my father could be heard throughout the household.\"knock\" \"knock\" my grandmother woke up in an instant at the sound of this, they were pounded knocks as if trying to break the door open, but it was as if they were landing strong blows but in a tired way.My grandfather awoke now waking up my father they both looked shocked and looked even more shocked when they heard the muffled screams outside of young and old people trying to escape before being instantly silenced. My Grandmother could no longer take this, she got up shrieking and threw open the door running.My grandfather ran after her pushing away the gray figures dragging their feet behind them. They were surrounded in a circle, the door diagnol to them.My grandmother began to cry in absolute terror as she saw a familiar figure approaching her. It was her daughter.My mother. She looked up at her husband , interlocking eyes with eachother \" I'm sorry\"\n\"Don't be sorry\" my uncle replied with tears forming in his eyes \"  I love you\" he said before looking out the window at the glistening moon with his wife hand in hand \" I love you to\" She replied before looking at me and my dad through the crack in the door, she smiled. Then. She looked up\nThis Is An emergency message-Beeped my phone,constantly,This Is an emergency message. By now my entire family was getting their phones out to Look, confused, I opened up the message , a private number, which was oddly suspicious. We thought it was a joke at first , we all regret thinking that now.The message had a link to a website, so without thinking I clicked unknowingly of what would occur next, I waited, holding my breath for what was about to happen. Until it loaded; DO NOT LOOK UP, DO NOT LOOK OUTSIDE, DO NOT LEAVE YOUR HOUSE AND DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON My whole family waited in caution as I read it out loud, Shocked my uncle rushed to the window to see cars,windows,doors and ambulances crashed,smashed and altogether broken.His mouth widened with fear, as if he had saw something even worse. His wife rushed towards him shouting his name \" SHAWN, SHAWN , TALK TO ME\" Then she just stopped, mouth widened staring without movement nor blink. We were seriously worried now, I rushed to my bedroom closing the windows and blocking any entrances into my room.I ushered my family to do the same, when I finished I checked the message again and realised what it truly said \" DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON\" I scanned for the details or information or something that could help me understand what the hell was happening , but I couldn't. Me and the others regrouped in the kitchen as I read the sentence to them. My mother jumped in fear as the TV blurted on \"This Is an emergency broadcast-\" \"this is an emergen-\" \"Don't\" \"Look\" The television faded off and the electricity powered down we were in complete dark and had no idea what was happening. My mother reluctantly walked over to auntie and uncle and began to whimper in fear.\n\nMy father beckoned her to say what was wrong but she just stood there and began to cry \" They,\" They're\" \"They're eyes\" They\" They've melted\"  That's all she could whisper out before collapsing in shock My dad jogged towards her checking her pulse, \"she's alive\" a sigh of relief was let out as the family heard him. He stood up and checked my uncles face he jerked backwards after seeing it. He had no eyes and there were black tears running down his face he checked his sister in laws next the same had happened, grey veins emerged from their face which seemed to have gained the texture of stone.My dad once again checked mother's pulse and stopped \"utter silence\" was all that thrived in the dining room he broke out in tears before managing to whisper out \"she's\" \"she's gone\" he crouched there for hours, hours passed and he still crouched there crying.i went to look outside but my grandparents reminded me not to. I decided to look anyway but look straight down and not look up. I noticed it was still pitch black outside and the moons reflection  reflected on the house opposites window.

        "text": "“Hello, is this Mia Bates?”\n\n“Yes, this is her.” I replied. \n\n“Hello, Miss Bates. I regret to inform you…” a soft, yet monotonous female voice began. She’d given these types of calls before. Hospice. I already knew.\n\nMy elderly mother had been battling Alzheimer’s Disease for the better part of three years. I had seen her the previous day, and had promised to return. She was only able to make generalized eye and head movements, and random mumblings. The rest of her body lay stiffened in bed, muscle atrophy well advanced. \n\n“… that your mother, Mary, has recently just passed away. I’m very sorry for your loss. If there’s anything we can do for you, please let us know.” \n\nI don’t recall the rest of our conversation. I remember that my hotel room began to close in around me, my anxiety flaring rapidly. I also remember, after I calmed down, the brief talk about funeral arrangements. She wanted to be buried, so I went ahead and got in touch with a funeral home to start the proceedings. \n\nI was never super close with my mother. We’d talk, and then not talk, and then talk again. It admittedly felt like a strange, fragmented relationship; each subsequent conversation became more and more disjointed as her memory progressively failed her. The fact she lived out of state worsened matters quite drastically.\n\nAs such, around a year before her death, I got in touch with a visiting nurse that would see her at home daily, and see to it that she was taken care of. It put my mind at ease, because despite our somewhat frayed relationship, she was still my mom, and I loved her. She’s still the only person I’ve really ever had besides my newlywed husband. \n\nAfter hearing the news of my mother, I wandered the rest of the day. I was numb. I wasn’t thinking clearly, I just sat in my hotel room. I felt this emptiness inside me. I ordered room service, and picked at the mediocre, overpriced food while watching some shitty local PBS Italian cooking show. She was making breadsticks, and she didn’t even put olive oil or garlic on them. Authentic Italian my ass.\n\nThe reading of the will occurred the subsequent week, and because of this and funeral arrangements, I had to extend my hotel stay. I was, of course, only planning a visit. I couldn’t have known that she would pass away. \n\nSince I was an only daughter and the only surviving family member, the will was as straightforward as I expected it to be. All of her earthly possessions went to me.\n\nIn the meantime, I drove over to my mothers house to begin the process of cleaning and sifting through her things. Her home, the home I grew up in, seemed practically unlived in, due to her mobility issues. When I walked through the front door, I caught the unmistakable scent of my mother. She never wore perfume, she just had a smell about her. \n\nWhich I found funny, because even now, I never liked it. I knew that it was supposed to smell lovely, but it bothered me somehow. I felt sincere guilt after this thought, but it still intruded in my mind. \n\nForcing myself to push the thought away, I approached the old, white cloth sofa, and seated myself on its pillowy surface. I closed my eyes, and, surprising myself, began to cry. I hadn’t in the previous week since her passing. In fact, I tore myself up over it.\n\nNow, however, alone in my mothers house, I let it out. It felt… appropriate. I felt better. I felt as if I was grieving in the right way, even though the crying didn’t feel all that genuine. I leaned back in the couch, quickly wiping away my tears. I sat for a while, reminiscing, the fond memories of my youth blocking the rather poor memories of her final years.. \n\nSnapping back to reality from the fuzzy haze of day dreams, I rose and dusted off some old photos on her fireplace mantle. Just me and mom. As always. My father, whoever he was, never came to see me. Fucker. Even at 33, I’d never met him. Mom, probably for good reason, never really brought him up in conversation aside from the casual mention.\n\nI walked around the ground floor, and, after scoping out the tiny kitchen and even smaller, one car garage, I wandered my way upstairs to the second, and highest, floor in the house. Two bedrooms, one master with a conjoined master bathroom, and another half bath down the hall. Pretty standard.\n\nI went into the master bedroom, opened the window blinds to get some midday sunshine, and began rummaging through her closet, looking for anything interesting. I found her clothes to be quite fashionable, and even tried some on, since we were generally the same size. I did find it odd myself, but I thought it was helping me heal or grieve in my own weird way. I found a silky white blouse much nicer than mine, that, for whatever reason, I decided to keep on. \n\nAs I began moving through the closet, I started digging through cardboard boxes scattered about the floor, in unorganized piles. I stumbled upon something rather peculiar in one of the boxes. An…\n\nArtifact?\n\nA container, more like. It was a wooden, rectangular shaped box and was stained a dark brown color. It had numerous, ornate carvings. They seemed almost… hieroglyphic. \n\nIntrigued, I flipped the wooden piece around in my hand and examined the bottom. Carved in the bottom was a name of some kind. \n\n“mors”\n\nWhat the fuck? I tried opening the thing, but was unable to. \n\nI slipped the artifact in my purse and set it aside, continuing my search. I found little else of interest. Jewelry, some photo albums, and more than a few trinkets. Realizing this was going to take several days to sort through everything in the house, I grabbed my purse, heading back downstairs and out the front door, late afternoon sun casting wide shadows across the driveway. Neighbors, out mowing lawns, planting flowers or playing catch with their kids, stared at me questioningly. The oppressive summer heat was stifling in my pant suit as I slipped back into my Acura RLX, beginning the drive back to my hotel room. The sun was nearly set as I pulled up, my AC blasting. \n\nAfter getting out of my car, I dropped into the dimly lit ambience of the main lobby, and asked the young, bearded, middle eastern man working at the front desk if they had any spare towels; I had used up the last one and since I left my “do not disturb” sign on the door, the maids wouldn’t have cleaned my room since my departure earlier that morning. I thought the man was out of place, I had been staying at the hotel for quite some time and had never seen him working before. Perhaps he was new?\n\n“Yes ma’am, it’s unfortunate that those lazy Mexican maids didn’t get to your room. I’ll be sure to have that rectified.” His Arabian accent was thick. I was troubled by the comment, and the least bit concerned that he would refer to the maids as “lazy Mexicans.” Stereotypical. Gross. Ignorant.\n\nI brushed off the strange comment as an example of the widespread bigotry still present in society, not wanting to get into an argument. I said nothing, grabbing the towels and turning my back as I began walking towards the elevator. I got to the elevator landing, flinging my purse over my shoulder. I pressed the up button, but, then, suddenly, a voice. From behind.\n\n“Shall I say a prayer for you, Mia Bates?” The same male voice from the front desk called from behind me. The words eerily cut through the air, the already present tension from the maid comment now became nearly unbearable for me. \n\nI turned slowly on my heels, the nape of my neck to the top of my head buzzing anxiously from the strange, unexpected question. Sweat beads, already formed from the hot weather, now trickled down my shoulder blades, past my bra straps, and began collecting in the small of my back. I took a deep breath, and, working up my inner courage, said,\n\n“Ex… excuse me?” I stuttered, tilting my head to the side questioningly, eyebrows raised, my lips parted in a confused, “wtf did you just say” expression. \n\n“Shall I say a prayer for you tonight, Miss Bates?” The sarcasm was palpable. \n\n“Wh… why?” I asked, my voice cracking with each syllable. I coughed, my hoarse throat seizing. Fear gripped my chest. \n\n“I just thought, that, perhaps… considering your current predicament, it may be beneficial.”\n\n“No, no, that’s alright. I’m not religious. Thanks.” I said, an uncomfortable line spreading across my lips. I awkwardly turned away and pressed the button for the elevator once more. \n\nI tapped the heels of my boots impatiently on the wooden floor paneling, the elevator still descending at a snail’s pace. Desperate for an escape from the man’s eyes that I just knew were staring daggers into my back, I darted up the stairs. \n\n“Have a good night Miss Bates.” I heard echo off the staircase walls. I ascended faster, eventually reaching my room after three flights of stairs. I jammed the keycard into the door, swinging it open, and just as quickly slamming it shut. I locked it, deadbolt and chain. As I sagged back against the door, my feet regretted taking the stairs, the high heels of my boots ensuring their soreness. \n\nI threw off my clothes and drew a bath, the painful aftermath of the anxiety attack crippling my muscles and joints. Pain moved from spot to spot, never staying in one place long, but long enough to cause a helpless feeling of despair. Sitting in the tub, I broke down. My stomach became a cauldron of fire. My breathing became faster and faster, my vision, spotty and tunneled. Another attack. Much worse.\n\nMy chest ached, weighed down by itself. The room began spinning. My thoughts raced, raced so fast I couldn’t breathe. The overhead light became blinding, causing green, red, and blue spots in my vision. Nauseating. I needed to puke. My stomach lurched. I pulled my hair back right as I barfed in the tub water. Once. Twice. Then dry heaves. Powerful dry heaves that stretched my rib cage to its limits and tore at the muscles in my stomach. Then cold chills. Then hot flashes. Then more nausea but my stomach was empty. Dry heaves again, the smell of my own vomit making me sick. The stomach pain suddenly became torturous once again, my lower intestines on fire. My bowels begged for release. No, I can’t. I’m an adult woman, not an animal. \n\nGet up, water splashing everywhere. Sit down on the toilet. The seat is disgustingly moist and slimy under my wet body as I shit my brains out, wave after wave of excruciating, burning hot diarrhea violate the toilet bowl, my small, broken down body pleading for mercy but receiving none. Any shred of dignity or self-worth I still had was vanishing with each passing moment.\n\nFinally, after what feels like hours but is probably more like five minutes, I’m done. I lean back against the raised toilet lid, panting heavily as I clear away the sweat from my brow. I wipe, using most of the paper roll, still feeling unclean and itchy. The smell of my own feces makes me start dry heaving again. My bowels still feeling irritable, I stand up wearily, hurriedly flush the toilet, and return to the tub; I was in too much pain from the anxiety attack to care about the food particles still floating in the warm bath water.\n\nThe spots in my eyes now look like old television static as I reenter the water. Shiny electric waves dance and ebb across my visual field. A visual aura. Pain shoots into my eyeballs. \n\nA migraine.\n\n“No! Please no!” I say aloud, the words reverberating off the cheap, white porcelain shower walls. I pushed my palms into my forehead, the pain intolerable. I had no medication on me, I, forgetful as ever, left it at home.\n\nI layed back in the tub, reaching to turn off the lights. My head pounded, a knife being thrust into it once every second or two. I didn’t care that the water was filthy, the light was KILLING me. I layed down, darkness all around me. The waves in my vision were still visible under my closed eyelids. \n\nI don’t remember falling asleep. I remember the pain slipping away, then darkness. I recall waking up still in the tub, marinating in the puke water. Sunlight peaks in around the bathroom door. I hear a maid cart rustling out in the hallway. I hear my phone buzzing from a call on the counter. My head still pounded in unison with my heart, but it was painless.  I tried standing up, my body still thoroughly exhausted, even after the rest. Crippling anxiety, panic attacks, and migraines. All at once. I felt them taking their respective physical tolls on me. \n\nDripping wet and feeling like a zombie, I jostled over to my phone, and answered, still fully nude.\n\n“Hello?” I ask groggily, not having checked the caller ID beforehand. \n\n“Yes, may I speak to Mia Bates?”\n\n“This is her speaking, who is this?”\n\n“I am calling on behalf of your mother’s funeral home, and I’m afraid I have some regrettable news, ma’am.”\n\n“What is it?” I asked, worry springing my body into a state of alertness.\n\n“Your mothers body is missing.” The voice said flatly. \n\n“What?” I asked, thinking I misheard.\n\n“Your mother’s body disappeared overnight in storage. I’m so, deeply sorry.”\n\n“What?” I asked again, my voice quivering in denial. \n\n“Like we said, it’s a very regrettable situation. We are doing the best we can to locate her.”\n\nI became frantic. My hands trembling, shaking terribly. Then, rage. \n\n“WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN SHE’S GONE?! WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!” I shouted into my phone, saliva molecules exciting my mouth at top speed, my anger seething. \n\n“Ma’am, please calm down. I’m sure it was a mistake. They are rare, but they can happen.”\n\n“DON’T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN!” I screamed, the immense feeling of invalidation seeping through my pores. Silence from the other end of the phone.\n\n“HOW I AM SUPPOSED TO HAVE A FUNERAL WITH NO FUCKING BODY?!” I shrieked, my hands trembling, my IPhone shaking.\n\n“Miss Bates, I, I don’t, I, uh, I don’t have that, um, answer for you right now. She just… vanished from her storage bag in refrigeration. Mia, please, believe me when I say this; I offer you my sincerest, and deepest apology. There are other arrangements we can make if you’d like.” \n\nI hung up without another word, throwing my phone across the room, the case protecting it from any serious damage. I paced around the room, pissed. Eventually, I sat down on the bed, pounding my foot into the carpeted floor again and again. My face, beet red, pulsated with the pumping of my heart. I was panting and sweaty, the anger fading away to helplessness. As tears began welling in my eyes, my mind blanked. I felt… everything… and yet… nothing. My swirling feelings, like an ocean tide, morphed and shifted with each passing second.\n\nMy mother’s body was GONE. How was that possible? Morgues don’t just lose bodies! What the fuck?! \n\nNo. Nope. I had to calm down. I really needed to calm down. Bathroom. Yes, my head was starting to kill me again. No, no, no, I couldn’t repeat last night. I decided to lay on the bed, and relax. I slowed my breathing. I calmed down. I had to think clearly without causing my body and brain to shut down.\n\nAfter an hour, I opened my eyes and picked up my phone. I spoke on the phone for so long that I could’ve been a telemarketer. The synopsis:\n\nThey had no clue. That was it. No body. No idea where it went, who took it, anything. They offered a settlement fee right then and there, which was probably to avoid the lawsuit they thought I would file. I was still royally pissed, but thinking clearly. I accepted the money, seeing as how I didn’t want to get tied up in the courts since I was from out of town. \n\nI threw myself down on the lumpy couch facing the television, already exhausted. The clock registered 12:30. Good lord. \n\nThe television provided ample background noise as I once again slept, this time throughout the afternoon. Finally, at around 4, I awoke, and, deciding that I needed food, slipped on a white, long sleeved Katy Perry tour shirt and a pair of blue jeans. The jeans proved to be a bit too loose, so I begrudgingly threaded a brown leather belt through the loops. As I finished the rummaging through my suitcase, however, I came upon something that made my blood stop. \n\nMors. \n\nThe artifact was sitting on top of my suitcase. Impossible! It hadn’t left my purse all day! Had someone been inside my room?! I hadn’t touched it!\n\nI lurched backwards in horror, slamming my back against the room’s door. The object beckoned to me with a faint red glow. The bolt lock of the hotel door stabbed my shoulder blade as I retreated, shooting firey pain into my bones. I cried out, reaching around my body reflexively. I cursed and winced, reaching for the doorknob to get me out of the room. I hurriedly turned it and exited out into the hall. Then, suddenly, panic. \n\nI had left my room key and purse in the room. I pounded on the door in frustration; I jiggled the locked door handle, not wanting to accept my own stupidity. Finally defeated, I trudged down to the front desk to replace my key card barefoot. I froze. A wall clock softly ticked in my ear.\n\nTick Tock.\n\nThe same man from last night. The middle eastern man. He smiled at me, his eyes unblinking. The front desk beckoned to me, I had no choice. Fuck. \n\n“Hi, um…” My words stopped. The man kept staring at me, still smiling. I was petrified.\n\n“I think I locked myself, um, sorry, uh… locked myself out of my room.” I stammered. \n\n“Oh?” He said, as if already knowing my predicament. \n\n“Yeah, I was hoping to get a replacement key card.” I faked an awkward smile as I looked down towards the floor. \n\n“My name is…” I was cut off sharply. \n\n“MIA!” He shouted loud enough to startle me. I winced and shut my eyes. Social anxiety stabbed my chest. \n\n“I prayed for you last night!” He winked at me as he slid a room key across the desk. I slid the card into the rhinestone encrusted back pocket of my jeans. I was silent as I turned away. I braced myself for something, anything. \n\n“Mors.” The voice said from behind. I stopped. The same word on the artifact.\n\n“What did you say?” \n\nTick Tock. \n\n“I defiled your mother’s corpse.” He smiled childishly. \n\n“What?!” Tears of confusion began to stream. \n\nTick Tock. \n\n“Like a dog.” His grin faded to a straight line. I stared at him, mouth agape, unmoving. My eyes were still watery. \n\n“Then I took it for myself.” \n\n“I…I…” I couldn’t speak. Couldn’t form words.\n\n“She was an evil woman, I'm afraid.” \n\nI still couldn’t push words past my lips. My hands shook uncontrollably. \n\n“Mors.” He snapped his fingers. The artifact was… in my hands. \n\n“I thought it was strange that you came to me holding it. You know what it means I presume? Once you find it?” \n\n“No.” I shook my head, my brain unable to decipher the information into something that made sense.\n\n“That’s because you’re an indulgent, self absorbed moron.” He cooed. “I was shocked that you held it and never opened it!”\n\n“Open it.” He said. I looked down at the artifact. The beady read glow illuminated my flesh. \n\n“Come on. Open it..” \n\nTick Tock. \n\nI slowly twisted the end of the artifact, pulling off a wooden block. Inside was a hollow tube, in which sat a tooth. My tongue instinctively felt around in my mouth. I panicked as I felt a squishy, gummy opening. \n\nMy tooth.\n\n“Yes! Your whore mother Mary is dead! And you shall join her in eternal damnation!” \n\nI started to weep, tears splattered on the tiled floor. I stumbled backwards until my legs hit into a sofa. I threw myself into it, my knees weak. \n\n“What’s… what’s Mors?!” I shouted, my face a blurry mess. \n\nThe man strolled out from behind the counter. I saw his lower half for the first time… \n\nHooves.\n\n“Mia, there are devils all around you! Some are more successful than others! Look at that man out in the parking lot! Look! White as snow! Did you know that he is a priest?! A good man by all accounts! And yet… he has his malnourished daughter tied up in his basement for dating! Dating, Mia! How depraved!” He chuckled, his long nails digging into my shoulder. \n\n“Oh yes, your mother, Mary, was… well, an evil woman. She was also a virgin.” I looked at the devil. His eyes were red and delighted. \n\n“As for Mors, it’s that box in your hand. It’s Latin for death, actually. People I wish to dispose of piece by piece. Sometimes a whole body, you’d be shocked at how efficient they manufacture things in this great country!” He propped his hooves up on the sofa. \n\n“Your mother’s body disappeared overnight in storage.” His voice matched the woman from the funeral home. He laughed heartily. \n\nHe was the woman. \n\nShe took the box from my hand, and began pulling. An arm, then a head, then…\n\n“Oh no!” I shrieked. My hands flew to my mouth. I began to dry heave.\n\n“Oh god!” \n\n“There’s no god here, Mia!” The woman changed back to the hotel receptionist. He licked his lips as he pulled out my elderly mother’s naked, mutilated corpse out of the tiny box. The dead weight flopped like a fish onto the hard tile. \n\nMy mouth burned, my teeth clicked on the floor as they fell out of my mouth in gummy, bloody clusters. My gums bled sheets down onto my shirt. I threw my hands out in terror.\n\n“You’ll live for a while, Mia. But you're the offspring of the whore down there, so it’ll be in misery. I’ll take all your family from you first. You’ll wither away alone and miserable. You’ll find their body parts in the box from time to time. Then the bodies. Then I’ll pillage your corpse. There’s nothing you can do about it.”\n\n“STOP!” I screamed. The lack of teeth made the words sound mushy and unintelligible. The devil held up Mors, pulling my teeth out of the box one by one. \n\n“Oh, that’s cute Mia. As for you, I’ve heard dental implants are quite expensive. I’d get on that if I were a pretty woman like you!”",

When they took me to the hospital each year, they told the doctors to draw some of my blood so they could know what was happening to their child.\n\nEven with all this, they never found a reason to physically or verbally abuse me. They never did in the first place, and I had never done anything wrong. They just left me alone to let me do my thing by watching TV Shows with a blank expression on my face.\n\nThe doctors told my parents I never needed Food, Drink, or Sleep, and I never even needed to defecate or urinate. But this piece of news caused parents to become even more paranoid about their son becoming a potential monster. It was after my 10th Birthday that my parents abandoned me, and in fact, I'm still a Black-Eyed Child to this day.\n\nI stayed in my former home until midnight after my parent's departure, knowing it was time to run away. I ran away from my home and my neighborhood and ran endlessly through the state of Oklahoma. Because of the lack of Food, Drink, or Sleep, I always stay energized from running any distance.\n\nI got to Tulsa almost two days after I left the neighborhood I grew up in. It was nighttime, and the streets were quiet, with barely any cars to hear. I walked endlessly, hoping to find a place to stay. However, things sometimes go differently than planned, as I heard a car slowly driving toward me.\n\nI looked to see a deranged person who saw me as a real-life monster. I never felt fear in my life, and I still haven't.\n\n\"Kid... I'm sorry for what I must do... You are nothing more than a monster now...\"\n\nI watched the man walk up to me with an enraged expression as he pulled out a knife and stabbed me in the chest. But the thing that horrified the man was that I. Did not. React.\n\nI felt no pain from the stabbing as I took out the knife, and my wound healed instantly, almost as if the wound was never there. The man was terrified, realizing that he could never kill me. He desperately pulled out his Glock and tried gunning me down. But I shrugged off the bullets, terrifying him even more.\n\nI don't know why this man tried to kill me. Perhaps he saw me before I saw him, but whatever made him do this must've been unpleasant. I walked over to the deranged man as he wasted his ammo on me. I healed from my wounds, grabbed his Glock, and used the final bullet on his leg, making him unable to walk. It was apparent that I had other Superhuman abilities besides my healing factor.\n\nWhen I was beginning to walk away, it turned out the deranged man wasn't done with me yet, as he pulled out a second Glock on me. But before he could try gunning me down again, several vehicles arrived, causing the deranged man to scream in agony as several younger people restrained him.\n\nEventually, those people I found out were the deranged man's family would turn to see me in horror, seeing me as the monster I am.\n\nMinutes after, the police arrived to detain the gunman for a trip to a mental hospital. The deputy of the police force of Tulsa, whose name I will not reveal, walked over to me and asked me a few questions, like how I survived the attack, why the deranged man tried to gun me down, etc.\n\nAfter I gave him the best answers I could give him, the Police Deputy gave me a pat on the back and said these words that I took to heart.\n\n\"If you wanna make something of yourself, then take true responsibility for your Great Power...\"\n\nI silently nodded as I walked away from the crime scene. I was allowed to stay at a hotel because of the attempted murder. Although I don't know how long I'll be staying at said hotel, I know that people are starting to recognize me. I don't know where my life will go when more people start to know who I am, but I do know one more thing.\n\n**I am the Black-Eyed Child, and no one can stop or kill me...**",

On it with messy handwriting was written \n,, Please spare some spare change ,,.\nI was practically running to the door when he pulled my purse. \nI quickly turned around because i thought he was trying to steal it.\nHe let go of my purse then pointed at his sign.\n\n- I don’t have cash on me right now.- that was a complete lie but like i said i was already late for work and didn’t want to get fired. I turned to the door and as i was ready to pull the door handle he pulled my purse again but this time i slapped his hand and went in to the building.\nWhen my shift ended i went outside, he wasn’t there anymore.\nI went into my car and started driving, i got a notification on my phone. It was my doorbell camera.\n As i turned to look at the road i saw him.\n\nI slammed on my brakes as fast as i could. When i looked again there was literally nothing.\nAt home when i walked into the door i saw him in front of me, i screamed.\nMy husband came rushing in asking whats wrong.\nWhen i looked back there was no one again.\n\n- There was a man here i i i saw him!- i said practically screaming.\n- There is no one here except me- he said weirded out.\n\n\nThe following 47 days were the same.\nI would go to work. He would be there for a split second and he would disappear. Drive home. See him.\nCome home. See him.\nEven in my dreams he would be there.\n\nI have had the same nightmare for 48 days straight. The nightmare would be of the day i first saw him.\nYou might think i am overdramatic, but he isn’t and doesn’t look like a normal man. His eyes are hollow and the ripped cardboard sign is poking out of his stomach. He is covered in blood. \n\nHis long beard from dirty white turned bloody red. \nI think that i’m actually going insane.\nI can’t keep going on like this.\nI want to go to work without having to see his hollow eyes and his body covered in blood. I just want to be and feel normal again.\n\nMaybe i should have just gave him the freaking money and maybe I wouldn’t have to be going through this.\nMy husband wants a divorce. I’m on the verge of being fired and am expecting it any second. My whole life is ruined.\n\nMy husband will get everything in the divorce and i’m probably going to end up in a mental hospital after the trial.\nI’m so sad and lonely well almost lonely. At least i have the homeless old man and his hollow eyes keeping me company even if its just for a split second.",

        "text": "A few weeks ago I began visiting a small independent cinema in the city I live in. They show less mainstream movies and more independent films, you might call them more artsy. Please don't judge me for how often I went there. Everybody needs a hobby.\n\nI was watching some drama and in the middle of the movie something in front of the screen caught my eyes. I that that two eyes were looking at me. But once I looked at them directly I could just see the backs of the heads of other visitors. This happened maybe 3 or 4 times during the runtime of the movie. It was strange, but at this point I didn't think much of it.\n\nA few days later I was watching a mediocre sci-fi movie. I saw the eyes again. I looked at them. This time I could clearly see a young girl looking at me. She did not move. And I did not see her blink. I was a bit disturbed. I thought maybe she wasn't really looking at me, but at the projector, or some other guest. Or maybe she just didn't like the movie. Honestly, I would get that. It wasn't really good.\n\nThe next day I saw no one looking at me in the cinema. Which was a relief. I was watching a horror flick. If someone had looked at me creepily I would probably have wet myself.\n\nOn the saturday of that week I saw her again. She sat much closer to me this time. And I was now sure that she was looking directly at me. She did not blink, at least not when I looked. I could only see her eyes above the backrest of her chair. But for some reason I imagined a creepy smile. Her gaze followed me even while I walked out of the room.\n\nI did not go back for a few days. I told myself that there were no good movies. Of course this were just excuses because I was too spooked. Well I went back on wednesday. And I was very relieved, when I did not see the girl and her unnerving gaze for the whole duration of the movie. I collected my jacket and the waste from my popcorn after the movie and turned towards the exit. There she was. Standing right in the exit. Her eyes fixated on me. I looked around, but there was no other way to leave the cinema hall. I exited my row, her gaze following me. I approached her standing in the exit. She was watching every step. I stood right next to her. She looked up, straight into my face. She did not blink. For a moment I thought about saying something. I swallowed and just left.\n\nWell. Let's just say I have not been back since. Today I decided to just watch some old sitcom at home. It was an enjoyable evening. I can not pretend to be fully at ease, but not having anyone observing me for a few days certainly was relaxing. That was until a few minutes ago. I turned off the TV and just sat there for a moment, when I saw them. Two points of light. Reflected in the TV, just past the windows of the living room. Now I am sitting here. Pretending to just scroll through my phone. The eyes are still there. My heart is beating so hard that it is deafening to me. At some point I will need to stand up and go to bed.",

        "text": " Hello, My name is Mike and I've been doing garden work for about 15 years. I have never had any abnormal jobs other than your typical creep who wants you to watch you trim the hedges. other than those types of jobs my 15-year career has been normal... until a week ago. I got a job from some rich executive who has a hobby for gardening and shrub art. He had a nice mansion not too far from Los Angeles. I usually work in the Bakersfield area but the pay for this job was too high to decline. it was only about an hour and a half drive so it was totally worth it.\n\nI arrived at the house in front of these fancy silver gates. I walked over to the intercom and pushed the button to call inside. It was silent for a few seconds until a voice came from the other end.\n\n\"Hello There\"\n\n\"*Yeah, Hi. uh- I'm here for the gardening job*\"\n\n\"One moment\"\n\nA few seconds later the gate slowly opened.\n\n\"All of the equipment is in the little shed right of the main fountain ahead of you. the owner has left you a note on the table in there\"\n\n\"*Ok thank you*\"\n\nI walked into the property and turned towards the shed. I crept open the old, wooden door and entered. Inside was a bunch of gardening equipment that I was to use for my Job. There was a little wooden table in the corner of the shed. On top was a note written on a piece of crumpled looseleaf. The note had an old coin resting on top of it. I picked it up and put it in my pocket. Then I started to read the note.\n\n\"Hello\n\nI am the homeowner, Mr. Glensworth. I have left you this note to make sure you do the finest job you can on my prized shrubbery. Before you get to work there are a few rules I need you to follow.\n\n**#1. Make sure the blades of the saws are fully secured before starting. I want very precise cuts. there should be no wiggle room for the blade to move.**\n\n*Fair Enough...*\n\n**#2. Never enter my house for any reason. I don't care what the situation is. DO NOT ENTER! the only time you shall enter is if rule 10 applies.**\n\n*Uhm... sure*\n\n**#3. if an older, balding gentleman wearing a suit exits my home and tries to talk to you, IGNORE HIM. just continue with your duties and he will eventually wander off.**\n\n*Strange...*\n\n**#4. If you hear someone call your name, you didn't. just ignore it.**\n\n*Is this some sort of joke?*\n\n**#5. at some point during your time here my dog will approach you. if his tail is wagging rub him on the head until he walks away. if his tail isn't wagging drop everything you're doing and leave. you will still be paid for your time. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES REFUSE TO PET MY DOG. IT WILL BE ANGRY**\n\n*This dude is a creep*\n\n**#6. if a maid asks you if you would like anything to drink, decline. IT will try to poison you...**\n\n*It?*\n\n**#7. If you hear a screech coming from the forest get inside the shed as fast as possible, sit down on the floor and close your eyes stay in that position until a second screech is heard. It will get you if you do not.**\n\n*What the F--- is this guy talking about?!*\n\n**#8. There's a chance that a limo will enter my property. if this is to happen enter the back of the limo. try to remember the path you took. it will take you to a random location within a few miles of my home. once you get dropped off try to make your way back. if you get lost then the best thing for you to do is pray that your death is quick.**\n\n*Death? this better be some not be some sick F---ing joke*\n\n**#9. If a man approaches you claiming to be me then kill him. That is IT. Do not kill him if he says \"Rule #9\" that is the real me. It's rare that the real me will be there so make sure.**\n\n*I don't like this...*\n\n**#10. This rarely happens. in the case that all the staff comes running out of my home you need to enter. find a bathroom and look in the mirror.**\n\n**#10a. if you see yourself then exit the home and continue your duties as normal.**\n\n**#10b. If you see no reflection close the bathroom door and be completely silent. If IT enters the room do not react or move. IT may circle around you, Whatever the case do not react at all. it'll eventually leave. once it leaves the bathroom look in the mirror again. repeat this process until you see yourself in the reflection.**\n\n*This can't be real, right?*\n\nI placed the note in my pocket and grabbed my gear. I headed out to the first shrub and started to work. about 10 minutes in I heard my name in the distance. I was about to look but I remembered rule #4. Horrified, I Continued to clean up the shrub. about an hour went by and nothing unusual happened. I was around 20% done with the job when I heard panting behind me. Suddenly a loud bark made me jump and yelp. I turned around and saw a golden retriever with a purple collar, his tail wagging steadily. I put the saw on the ground and started to pet the dog. 5 minutes passed and the dog didn't move. After about 10 minutes he stood up and walked away. *\"Finally\"* I thought.\n\nAs I watched the dog happily trot away I saw an older, bald gentleman in a suit hastily walking in my direction. Fear washed over me. I quickly picked up the saw and got right back to work. I heard the sound of footsteps stop behind me. \"Excuse me, sir\". His voice sounded like how you think a British Monarch would speak. He repeatedly spoke that phrase for about 7 minutes when he finally stopped. I heard him stroll away. Relief hastily washed over me. I continued to do my job. Some time passed without any event happening. *\"This has to be some TV prank right?\"* I thought. Just as this left my brain an elderly woman tapped me on the shoulder. It really spooked me. I quickly gazed towards her. Her wide smile was unsettling. \"Would you like something to drink? a water maybe?\". Her voice was frail. I was really parched and could definitely go for water but I knew what would happen. *\"No, I'm ok. thanks though\".*\n\nShe Turned around in a perfect 180, the smile never left her face. I was curious as to where she was gonna go so I watched as she walked away from me. When she got to the fountain I expected her to turn right and head into the home. But she never. She kept walking Straight, towards the woods. When she reached the edge of the property her head quickly flicked in my direction. she was now staring at me, Her smile now faded. I jumped and quickly turned around. I Took one or two deep breaths and look back. She was gone... as if she faded out of existence. Now I was really creeped out. I started to get back to work. At this point, I was about halfway done. I kept working knowing that every branch I cut got me closer to freedom from this hell.\n\nAs I finished a shrub I heard a loud screech come from the woods on the other side of the property. It was similar to an elk call but stayed at the same pitch for an extended period of time. I dropped the saw while it was still on and made a break for the shed. I slipped on the grass a few times before I reached the shed. I shut the doors, sat down, and closed my eyes. My heart was racing at a thousand miles. as I sat in the darkness I heard scratching at the door of the shed. Suddenly another screech blasted through the property. I heard something quickly shuffling away. I stood up and opened the shed door. For a split second In the distance near the woods, I saw a black blur fade away into the trees. I was frozen in place. after about 10 seconds I snapped out of it. I got back to work, my heart still racing.\n\nI was almost done with my job when the roar of an engine blasted behind me. A limo slowly peeled into the property. I sighed. I dropped the hedge trimmers I was using and walked towards the limo. As I opened the door I peered up at the woods. Standing behind a tree was the maid I saw earlier, smiling again. I got spooked and practically jumped into the back seat. I shut the door. I felt the limo begin to move. I looked out the window as we did a U-turn. *\"Remember the path I take\"* repeated in my mind. The ride totaled about 10 minutes. I had a basic idea of the path we took. I started to walk back to the home. After about 30 minutes of walking, I saw the opened silver gates. I sigh of relief came out of me. This hell was almost over.\n\nI could see the remaining shrubs in front of me. only about 10 more. I started to trim a shrub when I heard a door swing open. I looked behind me and saw all the staff run from the home, out into the woods. I quickly sprinted toward the front door and entered the house. I ran up the fancy staircase and started opening every door I could see. Finally, I came across a bathroom. I sprinted in and dazed into the mirror...\n\nnothing...\n\nThere was no reflection. I slammed the door shut. I slowly backed up from the door and stayed still, being as silent as possible. after about 2 minutes The golden door knob started to twist. the door swung open with aggressiveness. Then I saw IT. It looked like a normal human. the only difference was it was completely naked, about 8 feet tall, and didn't have any facial features. it was just smooth skin where there should be eyes, a nose, and a mouth. it crept into the bathroom slowly. My heart felt like it was gonna pop out. It started to get closer and closer until it stopped. Its face was about a foot from mine. I felt like crying but I knew that would be a death wish. It started to circle me slowly and steadily. it circled me about 5 times then it crept out into the hall, then down the stairs. I slowly turned around to face the mirror. As I peered over my shoulder I could see my own eyes wide open, staring back at me. The relief washed over me like a tsunami. I eventually exited the house and returned to my duties\n\nThe last shrub had one more branch to cut. I pushed the saw against it. I watched it fall to the ground. I unplugged the saw and watched the cord bounce on the damp grass. As I looked up towards the fountain I saw a man walking towards me. I froze in place. He came up to me and introduced himself as Mr. Glensworth. I was relieved to see him but then rule #9 phased into my memory.\n\n*\"He didn't say rule #9\"* I thought\n\nI quickly picked up the hedge trimmers from my belt and shoved them into Its head. It didn't bleed. it just fell to the ground like a ragdoll, still smiling. I stepped over its body and started to walk towards the fountain. I pulled out the note to make sure I didn't forget anything. I went over the note and I thought it was done. That's when I spotted a small arrow in the bottom right corner of the note. I flipped the note over. on the top line of the page there was one more rule.\n\n**#11. You must throw the coin that was on top of this note into the fountain before leaving. once thrown a taxi with no driver will pull up in front of the gates. get in the back seat and close your eyes, then count to ten. once the countdown ends open your eyes and you will be inside your own car. once this happens you are relieved of your duties.**\n\nI took the coin out of my pocket and stared at it. I threw it into the fountain water with a flick. Behind me, the sound of a car horn blasted through the street. I turned around and there, parked by the gate was a cab. I headed up to it and got in the back seat. I shut my eyes and started to count\n\n*\"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...\"*\n\nI paused, then said the final number.\n\n*\"10!\"*\n\nI waited another few seconds then I opened my eyes. I was pulled over on the side of the road inside my car. I peered over at my GPS. Just above the little car icon that showed my position read the words \"Bakersfield\". I was home.\n\nThis happened about a week ago. I haven't really been able to sleep. I can't get the image of IT out of my mind. I'm writing this post because I need some closure. has anyone ever heard anything remotely close to this? I can't find the mansion on google maps anywhere. Am I going crazy?! Did I dream all this?! Was I drugged?!?! I don't know. But ill never forget what happened to me.",

        "text": "38 stab wounds. That's what the news said, after a wordy oration of the stabbing. With punctures through the heart and lungs, Lena was judged to be a goner. That's why, when Lena walked home about a week after the accident, she was labeled as a medical miracle. For about a month afterwards Lena took refuge in her room to avoid being hassled by reporters.\n\nAfter that month, Lena invited most of her friends for a movie night at her place. It was unusual for Lena to host large gatherings--she most likely had a good reason for this one. Maybe she was offering an explanation, or she wanted to catch up. Honestly, I don't know what I speculated about when I parked close to her house and met up with the other arrivals.\n\nThe day was just now giving way to night, but Lena's apartment was already dark, and tinsel garlands still hung from every other wall. She hadn't yet removed the Christmas decorations. Everyone was chatting with one another and Lena momentarily left and returned. To all of the guests' happiness, Lena brought snacks and colas, and to their dismay, she turned on an old western movie.\n\nI settled in among the other guests. They were each assuring that they and Lena were doing well. I rolled my shoulders, letting go of anxious energy. After several minutes, I slipped away and left the apartment. I was in the parking lot walking to my car, when I almost passed Lena. Surprisingly, she was already at her car, fumbling with her keys.\n\nWhen I got closer, I could see why. She had a thin, fuzzy film over her eyes. Both of us jumped back, each a little spooked. She asked who I was.\n\nTruthfully, I answered, \"Isabella.\"\n\n\"Excellent, I was looking for someone... is it alright if you take me to the grocery store for snacks?\"\n\n\"I can get them myself, you don't need to bother with that.\"\n\n\"I'd like to pick them out myself, of course, if you're fine with it.\"\n\n\"..Okay.\"\n\nI entered her car, letting Lena enter the passenger seat before locking the doors. She was looking directly forward, focusing at nothing in particular.\n\nI turned left, right. My hands gripped the steering wheel with unnecessary force. When Lena asked me questions, I resigned myself to smiling and nodding. Eventually, I let out a disturbed breath.\n\n\"Is it that infernal U-turn?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that,\" I said through clenched teeth.\n\nAfter ten minutes, I stopped at a little mart.\n\n\"This one?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, can we go to that farmer's market? I'm dying for those apples.\"\n\nIt was almost dark now, and I impatiently took her to her beloved market. When the sky lost the last of its color, things started going downhill.\n\nLena turned towards me. \"Is it alright if I humor you?\"\n\n\"Yeah, of course,\" I replied.\n\n\"Do you believe in ghosts?\"\n\nI smiled and nodded.\n\n\"Its been so long since I've told a ghost story. I'd like to tell you about them, if you're into ghosts.\"\n\n\"Mhm.\" Evidently, we were alone on the road now, and I took the opportunity to go 60 in a 40.\n\n\"Well, of course, starting from the beginning, you need a dead person to make a ghost.\" She paused. \"Ghosts have something they want to do. Need to do. Most of the time, its something simple. They might want to tell their family they love them, one last time. Or finish that wretched business report. In that case, the spirit will decay. Out with the old, I suppose. They will go from room to room, repeating the same phrases, actions. You'd think they were made of scraps.\"\n\nI stopped the car. Thankfully, we had arrived at the market. I don't think I've ever been so happy to buy food. Too soon, Lena found what she was looking for and returned.\n\nI didn't turn on the radio, nor did I use my earbuds. Maybe I didn't know any better. Maybe I just wanted to get it over with. I don't know.\n\nLena continued her story.\n\n\"Some ghosts have complicated things they need to do, things that require a lot between the ears. They stay for longer. They can continue learning after death, they can memorize things, they can react to the things around them.\"\n\nA rosy hand helped itself to the water in the holder tray. Lena hadn't needed water for a long time. She was letting her soft, low voice reverberate through the car.\n\nSo fucking dramatic.\n\n\"And every now and then, you see a spirit that is perfectly preserved. They continue to walk the earth.. they can continue to live after death. They are omnipotent. Some,\" she said, \"can repossess their bodies. They can be killed, again and again, coming back based only on mental fortitude.\"\n\nLena turned towards me, grinning freely. She couldn't contain her explosive smile.\n\n\"Are you afraid of ghosts?\"\n\nI didn't nod. And I certainly didn't smile.\n\n\"Its not that far of a stretch that some ghosts can possess other people. You would think that would be grandiosely evil, but it really isn't.\"\n\nI was thirty, ten, five seconds away from leaving. After parking, I practically jumped out of the car and slammed the car door. I didn't fight Lena when she tagged along to the apartment. Past the check-in. Into the elevator.\n\n\"Some people truly are evil. They kill, again and again. It can be used for good, you know. And all they want is to live. Just once.\"\n\nLena wasn't making any sense, but I understood well enough what she said.\n\nDown the hall, and into the room. I opened the door. I nearly jumped. People were welcoming and congratulating *me*.\n\nLena gripped my arm. My vision was sucked out. The last thing I felt were groceries falling out of my hands before everything went black.",

I live with a single roommate in a shitty apartment the next town over from where I grew up. That's about all I want to divulge at the moment about myself beyond what you will read in my journal. I guess I can mention that I've been Journaling since I was a little kid. As a way to cope with my chronic memory loss and anxiety.\n\nBelow is a copy of my journal from last Thursday with a few edits and redactions. I'm just going to let it speak for itself. I plan to update regularly as things progress. Right now, other than missing a day of work and being traumatized I'm doing OK. I'll update you with my journals from Friday through tonight sometime tomorrow once I can post again. Until then, thank you for reading. \n\n05 Jan\n\nWell, I can safely say that Monsters are real. They call themselves Eidolons. At least that’s what the Spider calls itself.\n\nI'm still in shock over all this. I'm going to do my best to explain everything. You got this Kai.\n\nIt started as a normal morning at work other than Mrs. C giving me so much trouble today. That woman really tests my patience. I try to be so nice and sweet with her, but she always lashes out at me on the days I get her side of the hall. The hazards of being male I guess. I know she is lashing out from the abuse at the hands of her husband, but still. She doesn't need to take it out on every guy that walks into the building, her dementia be damned.\n\nBy the time I got off and home it was about 4pm. I went to go pick up some gas before coming home. Surprise Surprise, Andrew had another new guy over for the 5th time this week. It's like that man takes having a high “body count” as a personal challenge. I still have no idea where he finds these guys either. Deciding that I didn't want to listen to him have some wild sex for the 5th time this week, I opted to go pick up some food and wait for his boy toy to leave. \n\nI went over to \\[Redacted\\] and got dinner. My usual Kung Pao Chicken meal with hot and sour soup. After picking up the order I went over to the park to sit and watch the river.  Thankfully the snow cleared up last week and parking wasn't a hassle. It was deserted save for a blue Chevy truck that had parked in a spot near the entrance.\n\nSitting in my car I brought up a Youtube video and started to eat in peace. No depressing sex sounds, just mindless noise from some random Runescape Vid. I was about halfway through my dinner when my phone started to glitch out. It froze and started to buffer. Looking up for the first time in a few minutes I immediately noticed the Fog that had somehow rolled in. It was really thick shit too. I could hardly see the tree just a few feet beside my car. I rolled down my windows a few inches to see if the fog would waft in. Sure enough the fog was thick enough that it rolled in through my open windows. That was when shit got officially weird.\n\nWhat happened next literally felt like a memory. Like I was recalling a memory from my past, only it was vivid enough that I could feel everything about it. The sights, sounds, the smells and even the feel of the car cushion beneath me. I could also feel the emotions “I” felt in that moment, those were the strongest of all. Right away though, I knew two things were wrong. I wasn't in my car anymore, instead I was behind the wheel of some Ford SUV. I was also sitting next to a woman I had never met in my entire life. I felt an overwhelming sense of undying love for this woman. A feeling I have never felt for any woman, let alone one I have never seen before. She was talking to me about something… I can’t recall too much of the words. The words didn't seem to matter. What mattered was how I felt and after some time I felt that love turn to rage. Unbridled rage, and as I saw myself lift a hand and reach for her throat… \n\nI was back in my own car. In my own body. In my own mind. I wish I could better detail what happened but I didn't really get much time to process things. My windows were still rolled down and the fog was still outside, but it looked like it had cleared up a bit. I could see around my car now… and what I saw were trees. More trees than were at this parking lot. With a quick glance around I could tell I was in the middle of a fucking forest. \n\n(SNAP… CRASH…) I heard something close by make a sound.\n\nThough the river was far enough away that the fog obscured it, I could tell that it was still there from the rushing water. The sound was muted though as there were now dozens of trees in front of me between my parking spot and the river bank. It was during this survey of the trees around me that I spotted something horrifying.\n\n(Snap… Snap…) A similar sound came from my right and I looked over in that direction.\n\nJust a few feet from my passenger side door was a tree that had a fucking Eyeball on its trunk. We looked at each other for a split moment before another sickening (SNAP!) erupted through the forest as the trunk just below the Eyeball split open revealing rows of sharp splinters, like teeth in a giant mouth. Before I could even scream the tree launched a volley of splinters at my car. My windows deflected most of the splinters, but as the volley continued, the splinters grew larger and one eventually shattered my passenger side window. \n\nBy this point I was frantically trying to open my door, ducking down below the level of the windows. After some fiddling I managed to get the door unlocked, just as the attack ceased on my car. I seized the moment and ran. I just ran without any thought of where or what I was doing. All I knew was that at that moment I had to escape. I had to get away from this threat. \n\n(SNAP… CRASH…) More sounds from behind me.\n\nNope. I continued running, soaring past trees and earth. Unable to even think straight. The fog was starting to lighten up and I could see the forest a little better. It seemed like the kind of forest you would find in the mountains around here. I could also see an old Chevy just a few dozen yards ahead of me. *Blue Chevy. Main Road. Fuck it.* I sprinted to the Chevy with more determination than I ever felt in my life.\n\n(SNAP… CRACK…)\n\nI slammed my body into the Chevy, chest heaving. I’m not much of a runner anymore. Not since my field and track days back in High School. As I scrambled for the driver side window I heard a much louder (SNAP!!!) from behind me. Daring to not look yet, I kept my eyes forward and peered into the truck. Inside was a man, about 40 or so with an unkempt beard and long ratty hair. He was passed out in the driver seat. I slammed on the window only to be met with indifference from the man. \n\n(SNAP!)\n\nI finally looked behind me to see a tree, just inches from me. A massive wooden maw opened as the Eye stared down at me. It shot a quick glance at the unconscious man.\n\nI am not proud of what I did next. It will likely haunt me for the rest of my sad life, but I ran. I ran and I left that guy at the mercy of the tree monster. I sprinted to the other side of the Chevy and ducked in time for another shower of spikes. Glass and branches burst from the side of the vehicle, and within a heartbeat the long branches of the entity were investigating the inside of the Chevy. \n\nI ran away and kept running, now with a better idea of where the road was. I ran to find someone else. Surely that guy was already dead before I got to him. He didn't move when I slammed my fists on the windows. These thoughts raced through my mind as I ran. I only got maybe another hundred feet before I came crashing down a pit in the ground. \n\nOnly falling a few feet, I kept my senses and scanned the bottom of the pit. It looked like something had dug out this pit and lined it with leaves. A rustling sound came from a small tunnel I didn’t notice on my first survey. That’s when I noticed the bones and webbing mixed in with the leaves. As it dawned on me where I was, a massive black fuzzy spider the size of a Mastiff crawled towards me. Its two biggest eyes reflected my scared expression as I recoiled. Backing myself against the far wall I covered my face and peeked at this thing from between my forearms.\n\n“Another meal…” Came a low yet piercing voice, oddly human sounding. The spider stopped, fully in the pit now, its mandibles hovering over the spot I had landed on a moment ago. “Does this one speak?”\n\nWithout thinking I blurted out. “Yes… Yes! Please don't hurt me!” My cries seemed to give the spider pause as it stood there for a few seconds, its front legs stroking its fangs. Fangs that no doubt would be glistening if there was enough light coming in from above.\n\n“This food does speak!” The voice, I presume the monstrous spider at this point, said almost excitedly. In a motion too fast for me to follow the spider turned enough to fire something from its butt straight at me. The webbing hit me square in the chest and knocked the wind out of me as it unfurled and began to encase me.\n\n“Oh god! Please no! Please! Don’t eat me!” I screamed between gasps of air. The webbing pulled tighter and tighter as I struggled in vain.\n\n“I love it when the food begs…” The spider cooed as it advanced on me. “Makes the slow dining experience more entertaining.” As the spider got right up onto me. Its fangs mere inches from my face I could feel myself starting to feel weakened. My head was starting to pound and the strength in my limbs faded. “Let’s take a good look at what I caught.” The spider brought its head down to bring one of its two massive main eyes right in line with my own eyes. “What kind of Eidolon are you?” \n\n“No…” I choked out. “I’m human… please…” I managed to add before the spider interrupted me.\n\n“Human? You claim to be human?” The spider backed away slowly and as it did I could feel some of that weight in my head recede. My limb strength came back to me, though I felt like I had just finished a session of weight training.\n\n“I am human.” I said with more breath and conviction. “Please, I don't know where I am… or why I am here. I was just…”\n\n“Humans are a myth.” The Spider spat back in a cold, yet curious tone from across the pit. It began to dig around for something hidden amongst the debris. “Though I will say… You do fit the bill.” After a moment the spider pulled up a skull of some sort and examined it. Looking between the skull and me it finally tossed the skull and said, advancing as it did, “I’ll have to examine you after I drain you. If you are human then this should be a very good meal indeed.”\n\n“No! Please!” I screamed and thrashed as the spider towered over me again. The waves of exhaustion took hold once more and this time I blacked out quickly. \n\n*\"This is it\"*\n\nI was violently awoken some time later on my stomach. My shirt was off and a mysterious searing pain was coming from my shoulder. No spider in sight.\n\n*\"Free me you wretched human!\"* The spider's voice echoed in my mind and the pain in my shoulder burned more as it felt like my flesh was being ripped off my body.  \n\n\"AH!!! WHAT DO YOU MEAN? How are you screaming in my head?\" I reached up and put a hand to my shoulder. To my horror my hand met something…but it wasn’t my flesh. Looking over my shoulder I saw a miniature version of the giant spider from before. Only its legs were adhered to my skin from just above my shoulder blade to the top of my right shoulder. As it thrashed my stomach turned. I could see my skin lift with its legs as it tried to release itself. With every motion the thing made, the pain intensified. \n\n*\"RELEASE ME! OR I WILL TEAR YOUR BODY APART, PIECE BY PIECE!\"* The spider glared at me and lifted a front leg causing another wave of pain to hit me.\n\n\"If I do, you will kill me. I don't know how you got stuck to me… but I'm not gonna let you kill me!\" With that thought the spider suddenly went still. The spider looked at me with frozen shock. Feeling a sense of confidence wash over me I asked, \"What? Lost your fight?\" \n\n*\"How did you paralyze me? What power did you use? What sick abilities do you possess?\"* The spider's voice rang in my head incessantly as I stood to look for my shirt.\n\n\"Shut up! I don't know what is going on any more than you do!\" Finding my shirt a few feet away I quickly attempted to put it on. Sadly the spider's bulk impeded my ability to do so. \"Look… if I knew how to free you from my back I might do it. But you need to swear to me that you will not attack me anymore! I just want to figure out where I am and go home.\" I just tied my shirt around my waist admitting defeat.\n\nThe spider continued to glare at me for a few moments before nodding and replying, *\"I will not harm you any further. At this point I wish to know what you are more than I wish to eat you.\"* The spider slumped a little.\n\n\"Alright. Then, until we figure out what's going on… truce?\" I asked, watching the spider as it slumped more, and I realized that its body was starting to meld onto my flesh. \"WHAT? What are you doing?\" I protested.\n\nThe spider looked at itself and in a shocked tone thought. *\"I'm sinking into your body… so you are some form of shape shifting ooze! I knew you were an Eidolon!\"* It looked at me accusatory and tried to lift itself up, but to no success. \n\n\"I am not an ooze! Or whatever an Eidolon is! I'm a human. This has to be your…\"\n\n(SNAP)\n\nWe both looked at each other and my eyes grew wide as a second (SNAP) came from just above us.\n\n*“Be quiet. That is an Ent… if we remain silent it may leave us alone. I normally hunt them, but in my state it would take me a while to make the special net I need to catch one.”* The spider thought to me as I could see its eyes dart across the ceiling of the pit.\n\nI simply nodded and we stayed motionless and silent for several more moments before another…\n\n(CRACK) (SNAP… RUSTLE)\n\nTree roots ripped from the ceiling and grabbed at me. With a yelp I started to tear at the roots, but couldn't break through the bigger ones. That's when the spider called out, *\"Try to release me! Use your ability to simply release me. Feel it!\"* The spider was biting at the roots and trying to break my backside free. *\"I will eat it and then that will return me to my original size. Then we can figure out what you are.\"* \n\nI thought to myself, this bastard is sadly my best bet at survival. So I did what it suggested. I thought about it. I thought about releasing it from my back.\n\nAnd it really was that easy. The second I thought about releasing the spider all 8 legs were off my back and free. Within seconds my body had been freed from the roots. \n\n*\"Climb! We need to get you above ground. You will be bait while I spin the net to catch the Ent.\"* The spider rushed for my head and pointed at where the opening was. *\"GO!\"*\n\nI did as I was told. I dived for the opening and straight into the waiting jaws of the Ent. Its form was a bent and mangled sight. Much like the first time, it had a wooden maw made from the inside of the tree it inhabited lined with rows of jagged splinters. \n\nThe spider cackled confidently and shot a giant ball of gray silk into the back of the tree's mouth. The ball exploded sending the tree reeling backwards. I used this moment to scramble out of the hole and away from the seething, 30 ft. douglas fir. Getting to my feet I ran in a random direction. \n\n(CRACK)\n\nI didn't dare to look back. I heard the spider mentally call out. *\"I need time to make a net to catch the Ent. It's only edible while it's in floating state. I will wait in ambush for it to fly near one of my pits and shoot it out of the sky.\"* It hops off my head and into a bush at the base of another large oak. *\"Another of my pits. Sadly empty, but perfect for our purpose. Keep its attention and when I call out bring it this way.\"*\n\n*\"Fuck, why am* ***I*** *bait?\"* I thought to myself as I nodded and looked back the way we came. Seeing the flying Eyeball speeding for a tree a few yards from the tree the spider had hid under. \n\n*\"You can speak in my mind. Good. Keep communication silent. Ents may not be able to speak, but they are smart and can understand speech.\"* The spider thought back immediately, after a beat adding, *\"You are its prey already. That is why.\"*\n\n*\"Right… on both accounts. Fine.\"* I thought to myself again and took off towards the sound of the river making sure I could track my way back to this tree. *\"If you run away and Fuck me over I will find a way to haunt you.\"* I thought as threatening as I could convey in a thought.\n\nThe spider remained silent as I sped towards the river the Eyeball in hot pursuit. All I needed to do was distract this thing for a few moments? Easy I thought. I'll just go in a wide spiral towards the tree. After a few hundred feet pain ripped through me starting at my shoulder and radiating to my core. *\"What did you do?\"* The spider roared at me as I spun around and started instinctively running back towards the pit. \n\n*\"Nothing! I just ran. I'm coming back towards you though. I have a theory.\"* As I had suspected the moment I started running back the pain subsided. *\"I guess we have a range limit now.\"*\n\n*\"Your strange ability is becoming more annoying by the moment.\"*. \n\nI would love to give a play by play of how I dodged the Eyeball. However, I was so focused and scared I can barely remember much from those few minutes. After a few tense moments of cat and mouse, the spider finally called out. *\"Ready! Bring it this way.\"*\n\nI obeyed and started to run back towards the spider. Running to make sure I would give the spider a good shot at the Eyeball from its pit. I stopped at the base of the tree to catch my breath. My feet presumably a few inches from the side of the pit. *\"Now remember, this is my meal. Once I'm finished If there is anything left you may have the remains as a reward for playing bait.\"*\n\nBefore I could respond something in the distance caught my eye. The fog seemed to be rolling in again. The thick mist was closing in on our location and for the first time in what seemed like forever I could begin to hear the sound of traffic in the distance. My attention was snapped back to the situation at hand though as the Eyeball grew closer.\n\nThe Eyeball sped towards me clearly preparing to take over the tree I was leaning against. However just as it got within a few yards of the tree a blue net of some sort launched from the ground and ensnared the Eyeball. The Eyeball fell under the weight of the net and was knocked back slightly. The spider sprang from the pit and landed on top of the Eyeball, sinking its fangs into its spectral \"body\".\n\n*\"Hey. Something is going on. I can hear traffic again and there is this fog rolling in on us.\"* I tried to explain to the spider as the fog finally washed into the area around us and began to cover my feet, rising up to meet my legs in quick order.\n\n*\"Don't distract me while I eat, human!\"* The spider quipped back in an aggressive tone presumably engrossed with its kill. \n\n*\"I just think…\"* Was all I could get out before I was hit once more by that intense memory that wasn't mine. Only this time it was seemingly playing in reverse. With everything flowing backwards. The only difference was the rage. The rage stayed throughout as the memory rewound itself. And once it got back to the beginning, I caught a quick glimpse of the rear view mirror and got to see \"myself\".\n\nI was a Caucasian man in his late 20s or early 30s. A big bushy beard of blonde hair with a bald head. That and some facial features is all I could make out before my senses came back to me.\n\nI was standing in the middle of the park's parking lot. Just a few hundred feet from my car and the old Chevy from earlier. I looked at my feet and saw the spider was gone. I was able to breathe a sigh of relief when I felt a pain in my shoulder and heard in my head. *\"Why did you interrupt my meal? And where are we? This is not my forest.\"*\n\n\"No.\" My voice cracked as I began to break into tears running for my car. \"This is my home! I'm back!\" I sped for the car at first then remembered the man in the Chevy. I weighed my options and decided I didn't want to know if he was still alive or not. I just wanted to get home and get somewhere safe.\n\nAs I approached my car I was both confused and relieved to see that the window was in fact not shattered anymore, nor was the window even rolled down. I realized in my haste I left the keys in the ignition with the car still on, but no issue seemed to come from it. The pain on my shoulder grew as the spider spoke up again. *\"I do not know what you are doing to me now, but I am suddenly incredibly tired. If this is a ploy…\"*\n\n*\"Oh just shut up already. I'm not trying to hurt you! Look. I'm going to go home and try to figure this shit out. Just please keep quiet for a bit while I try to relax.\"*\n\n*\"Fine…\"* It thought before the pain subsided and the spider went quiet. Thinking about it for a moment I cautiously looked back at my shoulder. Sure enough there was the spider, it looked pressed to my back like some hyper realistic tattoo. Satisfied by that insane reasoning for the moment I got into my car, sat down, and cried.\n\nSome time later I calmed myself down and drove home. It was late by the time I pulled in. Thankfully Andrew's toy was gone. My roommate was in the living room eating something while he watched an episode of old Family Guy. He took one look at me and my disheveled clothes, puffy eyes, and just nodded. He may be an asshole sometimes, but at least he knows when to keep to himself. \n\nThat's it. I got home and started typing. It's around 10 am Friday morning now. I fell asleep at my computer around the time I met the Spider. I woke up a few hours ago and decided to finish this entry over coffee and some breakfast.\n\nThe spider hasn't woken up yet, but when it does I hope we can peacefully exchange some information. Thankfully I'm off today and tomorrow this week.",

        "author": "binibiningm",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/106q8br/dont_buy_plasticwrapped_durians/",
        "text": "The king of fruits, many can’t stand its foul smell but some enjoy eating it. If you are part of the latter, just an advice that might spare your life… DON’T EVER BUY PLASTIC-WRAPPED DURIANS.\n\nI have this acquaintance of mine, let’s call him Jeff. An active young public servant that has been a part of numerous organizations doing community projects. The first time I met him was during a tree-planting activity when I was still a sophomore. I don’t really have the genuine compassion of planting mangroves and praying for them to grow. I just joined because of a school requirement.\n\nBut Jeff is different, he has this bright aura around him and it shows that he loves the life of service. He talks with a contagious smile and is surrounded by peers. He stands out, hence why I noticed him. His face was not familiar then so I thought he was from a different school. I didn’t know anything about him other than this, not even his name… Not until we meet again in the first week of December.\n\nTo my surprise, our place is the next stop for Jeff’s team. I live on the outskirts of town, it is extremely far from the city proper. It is rural-like in this location; there are rough roads through a thicket of bushes and trees, and also a nearby beach. Apparently, their next project is a coastal cleanup and our sitio is one of the options. He is the sole representative to explore the area. He approached our purok leader and just because I live next door, my introverted self ended up being his tour guide. \n\nThe local beach is near but we are not living on the seaside. It’s about a 3-minute walk if you use the shortcut that only the residents of this place know, hence why he needed an assistant. There was an awkward atmosphere between the two of us. After a casual introduction, he told me stories about himself, his team, their goals, and whatnot, while we were walking. He was trying to make a conversation. I, on the other hand, was so focused on clearing our path. Holding tree branches blocking our way and trying not to step on the muddy soil. \n\n\n“One left turn and we’re there.” I uttered. “You will notice soon that we’re stepping on the sand.”\n\n\n“Great! Never been on a beach since the lockdown so this excites me,” he replied. “By the way, thank you. We’ve been crossing walls and narrow roads I couldn’t remember. I will surely get lost without a guide.”\n\n\nI responded with a smile then we continued. It is complicated to explain the route going to the beach but that one final left turn we took led to a footbridge made of a series of huge coconut lumbers. This connects to the main entrance of the shore. As soon as we reached the seaside, he started roaming around while I waited on a makeshift seat at the end of the bridge. \n\nIt took him over an hour before he finally got back. Just like how I first noticed him, he was again exuding a positive and lively aura like a toddler getting new toys. He shared that he got to know some residents and interviewed a few. It seemed like that coast could be their next project. While he's busy sharing this to me, I saw something seeping through the right pocket of his backpack. I was looking at it intently even my brows furrowed.\n\nJeff might have noticed this as he suddenly diverted his words. “Oh right! I got these at a discounted price. Aling Neneng sells it, a very kind woman. She kinda reminds me of my grandma, she even offered me water and food.”\n\n\nHe took it out and showed me. There were three fleshed durian seeds wrapped in a transparent plastic bag. It looks delicious with its yellow and smooth texture. It smells good as well. \n\n\n“I was about to accept the food she offers but then I thought that I shouldn’t keep you waiting, so I decided to buy this as a little support to Aling Neneng’s business and also as a sign of gratitude. Here.” Jeff handed it to me.\n\n\nI did not respond right away, I was lost in my thoughts. Those durians made me recall an old belief. My parents always remind me not to buy ready-to-go durians that some vendors sell. They said that these durians might be “dinuraan”. The root word “dura” literally translates to “spit”. It is a common fact that whenever you buy durian or any other fruit, you must see how the vendor cleans and opens it before they give it to you. \n\nThey said that some vendors spit on the fruit they sell before they wrap it up. They will then put some spell on it making those who consume it their ‘loyal customer.’ Have you ever heard of a belief that if you spit on the food of your pets, then they will be more loving and obedient? It’s like that, but with humans. \n\nI don't believe this because it feels like judging the small vendors. But honestly speaking, I couldn’t accept Jeff’s offer. Not because of this old belief, but mainly due to hygienic reasons. If I were there with him at that time and witnessed how Aling Neneng chopped off the durian and put it on the plastic, then I would definitely devour it. But I wasn’t and I have trust issues with the man.\n\n\n“No, thank you. I’m allergic to durians.” I answered mindlessly. This is one of the crappiest lies I’ve made in my entire life. \n\n\nI do feel bad about how I responded because it made Jeff silent for some time, which is unusual. But still, he just smiled and put the durians right back on where he placed them saying that he’ll keep them for himself. \n\nOnce again, I assisted him in getting back to the main road where he could fetch a tricycle on his way home. \n\n-\n\nYet our paths crossed again yesterday morning. \n\nI was casually walking when I saw a familiar figure. A pale-skinned thin man wearing jeans and an oversized shirt, who has a very good posture despite carrying a huge black backpack. I was about to turn my back but I had to buy bread at that bakery next to where he is standing. \n\nI didn’t have a choice but to move forward, or else, there's no pandesal for breakfast. I continued striding until eventually, he called me.\n\n\n“Hey ****!” He greeted me while waving his hand.\n\n\n“Hey… Jeff.” I awkwardly uttered.\n\n\nI stopped in front of him. As I got a closer look at him, he seemed skinnier.\n\n\n“I saw you from a mile away. I bet it was you and I was indeed right.” \n\n\n“Yeah, you too! I recognized you from afar.” I said while forcing a smile. \n\n\nHe was maintaining eye contact but I was distracted. My sight was diverted to his bag, the bottom seemed soaking wet. There was also some sort of smell. It’s reeking all over the place. I looked around to track where that pungent odor came from. It smelled rotten.\n\nThen an idea came into my mind. The foul smell might have come from a bunch of trash.\n\n\n“Is today the day for coastal cleanup?” I asked to feed my curiosity.\n\n\n“Ah no.” He quickly responded. “We will do it on the third week, but on a coast nearer to the city. We are tight on budget. We chose it over this place so that we can accommodate the transport costs of all the volunteers.”\n\n\n“I see.\" I was weirded out. \"What brings you here, then?” \n\n\n“My mom is craving some Durian. I bought a bunch last time, she loved it and is asking for more.”\n\n\n“Oh ok.” I was so confused. Did I hear that right? To buy durians in such a secluded place? At this time of the month?\n\n\n“Wait... Have you been coming here lately?”\n\n\nHe nodded indicating that I was right. “I’ve been coming here for weeks now. Even last Christmas. I always buy durian from Aling Neneng”\n\n\nMy smile gradually faded as I started to feel worried. I pinched my nose, that smell was really something.\n\n\n“So… you are going to the beach today?”\n\n\n“Not anymore, I've been there.”",

        "text": "[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zza412/every_year_a_new_family_joins_our_town_part_2/)\n\nGetting rid of Jules wasn't easy but it had to be done. \n\nI vividly remember meeting my best friend. It's one of the few memories I have that appear somewhat clear in my mind, a happy moment without alteration. Of course, it was easier then because I was younger. \n\nAlthough I can't say how old for sure. I'd been trying to remember whether Benny was already born. I'd been trying that for different memories but he only appeared in more recent ones. \n\nBut the image of Jules is as clear as day. She was like a ray of sunshine, dressed in a white skirt with lots of bright lemons, almost the color of her hair. Her mum had the same lemons on her apron. We went over to their house after they'd invited us to a barbeque. \n\nThe parents were chatting loudly. Our mums connected right away and so did Jules and I. After we ate, we went inside and played games.\n\nThinking about it now, it was a lot like the day Alex's family came over. \n\nWe like to repeat stuff. \n\nAfter that day we were inseparable. She introduced me to everything I know and love. I used to look at her and feel like I belonged.\n\nThe last time I looked at her, I wished that she would drop dead. \n\n\\--\n\nMum and dad were both gone. Mum had work to do which was odd for a Sunday but sometimes that's what it was like, we never questioned her work. Dad had gone toon some kind of play date with Benny. None of us mentioned last night during breakfast. \n\nJules and I were in my room, getting ready for the cinema. I knew right away that there was a reason why she came to my place before, she wanted to talk about Alex.\n\nI meant to keep things to myself, at least for now but after the night I was feeling awfully nervous. Instead of drinking the milk last night, I'd poured it away because I didn't want to sleep, I wanted to think. Now, with only two hours of sleep and a mind going in all directions, I started regretting my decision. \n\nIt made me more emotional, and less careful. When she asked about Alex, Jules probably wanted to know if I had a crush on him or something.\n\nYou can imagine the look she gave me when I told her about everything else. The words came out of my mouth like vomit. \n\nThe engraved name, the view from my window on his first night, the things father said.\n\nI was pushing my fingernails into the palm of my hand to keep myself from starting to cry. \n\n\"He looked so scary. Nothing like my dad,\" I whispered after I'd poured out everything that had happened without a pause. Jules had been watching me carefully and quietly the entire time.\n\n\"But, Jules. I don't think he's going crazy. I think he tried to warn me,\" I whispered the last part even though we were all alone in the house.\n\nMy friend got up and sat down right next to me on the bed, with no distance to move. She put her hands on top of mine which were still formed into fists and gently lifted up my fingers. \n\nThen she moved her hands to my wrists and grabbed them tightly. \n\n\"God, you are so stupid.\" \n\nHer tone was mellow, cold.\n\n\"What?\" \n\nShe sighed. \n\n\"Insufferable, really. If it weren't for your mother, you'd probably be long dead. I don't even wanna know how often your parents drug you, although I can assume.\"\n\nI stared at her face that showed not a single sign of emotion.\n\nHer grip became even tighter.\n\n\"I am sorry, Charlie. I hoped we could earn our place in Agsbury alongside each other. Of c,ourse I would have gotten married first and worked to be accepted as a member with my own house. And then you could have tried the same. We would have been like our moms. With our upbringing, we would have had many years to live. Now only one of us does.\"\n\nI tried to pull away but now her nails were digging into my flesh. \n\n\"What on earth are you talking about, Jules?\" \n\n\"Only worthy ones are chosen to live in heaven, Charlie. Our families worked so hard to come to Agsbury. They spend all their time becoming important members of the community. One day, they will be chosen to become the soil that nourishes our earth. The earth that gives up happiness, fortune an,d health in return.\"\n\nFinally, she was showing emotion but in a way that made my blood freeze. Her eyes were opened wide the entire time as if she'd forgotten how to blink and her teeth were grinding loudly against each other as she tried to force the biggest smile I'd ever seen. \n\n\"Where did you learn all this? What soil? You mean when we die and are buried?\"\n\n\"When we are offered, and buried, silly. But only when it is our time to leave Agsbury. And I have no intention of leaving the community anytime soon. But you,\" she signed. \"You don't understand it, Charlie. Even with all the years, your parents have tried to prepare you, you've stayed clueless. Do you know how hard it is to be friends with someone so dumb? If it weren't for your lovely mum, I would have abandoned you much sooner.\" \n\nShe loosened her grip slightly and tilted her head.\n\n\"Oh poor Charlie, you look so scared. Don't worry, it will all be fine. You won't be turned into soil before you turn 18. I will talk to your mother and she will wipe your little memory as gently as she can. And then we can have a bit more time together.\"\n\nWhile all her words were like daggers in my brain, I had to focus. It was possible that my friend had lost her mind but after everything I'd witnessed these past days, I think the truth was much more complicated. \n\nAnd whatever happened, I couldn't let her talk to my parents. I had to keep my memory clear. \n\nSo, as Jules kept blabbering about her fruitful future, I slammed my head against hers in a moment of surprise. I didn't even think about it, my body simply started to act and my brain tried hard no time to keep up. She instinctively let my arms go and I got up as quickly as I could, ignoring the pain in my face. \n\nShe followed fast and grabbed my shirt to pull me down to my knees.\n\n\"HELP,\" she shouted but I shut her up by pushing my elbow into her stomach. She dropped to the ground and I quickly jumped on top of her, pushing my knee into her chest. \n\nAs the adrenaline rushed through my body, I tried to think of my next step. I wasn't used to fighting anyone. And then we were interrupted. \n\n\"What the hell?\" A new voice spoke. \n\nIt was Alex who had come inside without our knowledge.\n\nNobody in bloody Agsbury ever locks their door. \n\n\"Get her off me,\" Jules started crying. \n\nAlex didn't move. He looked at our bloody faces.\n\nWhen Jules said \"Charlie has gone mad,\" it looked as if something inside of him clicked. \n\n\"Do you have tape? A rope maybe?\"\n\nJules and I both stared at him.\n\nI took a deep breath.\n\n\"Jules said my mother drugs me. Can you hold her down while I look for something?\" \n\n\\--\n\nIt was in the honey. There was no scent to it but it made the most sense. She kept it hidden at the back of the highest cupboard. And we never had honey with breakfast or any other meal.\n\nBut it was always in my milk.\n\nGetting Jules to swallow the honey mixture I made wasn't easy but we managed. My heart was racing the entire time. My mind was so focused on hoping that nobody would come home that I didn't even have time to process what had just happened. Together with Alex, I had drugged my best friend, tied her up, and hid the sleeping girl in my closet. \n\nThe pain only got to me as Alex and I cycled all the way to Agsbury lake and I'd told him everything I'd learned from my father and Jules. Agsbury lake was my favorite place because I could always go there to be alone.\n\nOf course, back then I didn't know that the people of Agsbury regularly fed it with corpses because they believed that it nourished our water. \n\nAlex looked surprised after everything I told him, though not as much as me. Maybe because his old life was more recent than mine.\n\n\"I don't know why I never questioned anything before. Agsbury really does feel like heaven but lately, everyone seems to be breaking a little. Jules said something about them turning people into soil. When they find me-\"\n\nI stopped talking. \n\n\"We need to get away,\" Alex said firmly. \n\n\"There is no place in Agsbury where we can hide and we can never get far enough on our bikes. And what about our families?\"\n\nI wrapped my arms around my legs.\n\n\"So what now?\" he asked.\n\nI shrugged.\n\n\"I'm sorry I pulled you into this.\" I took a deep breath. \"Why did you even help me and not Jules?\" \n\nAlex started tapping his fingers on the ground nervously.\n\n\"When I saw you there, something in my mind shattered. For a moment I remembered the night we came here. Your dad was there. And other adults. They-,\" he paused for a moment. \"They hurt me. Tried to make me comply or whatever. Jules was there as well, with all the adults. I think it was some kind of initiation and she seemed weirdly into it. She had that look your mum always has. The one my parents now have as well.\"\n\nI swallowed. \n\n\"Was it that night you carved my name into you?\" \n\n\"Yes. I don't remember everything but- I know it was bad. And it's our families that did this to us. We need to get help or-\"\n\n\"Charlie!\"\n\nBoth of us turned around in the same second to see where the voice was coming from.\n\nIt was my dad, walking down the path that leads from the street to the lake.\n\nI jumped up. \n\n\"Shit, shit, shit. What now?\" \n\nAlex looked just as clueless as me. And even more afraid when his eyes met the ones of my dad.\n\nAt the top of the path, I saw a car. We didn't have a car. Nobody in Agsbury did. \n\nThere was no need for the residents of Agsbury to have cars. We had bikes for short trips inside the town and if we wanted we could buy skateboards or roller skates. But nothing with a motor.\n\nIf you are someone with important privileges, you do drive a car at times. For example, if you pick up a new family and dad was a trusted resident. But I had no idea why he had it now, was he trying to get rid of us?\n\n\"Get in the car! Now!\"\n\nAlex and I both turned to the water for a split second. Should we try to swim? I didn't even know where the lake ended.\n\n\"We don't have much time. Get in the car now. Benny's already inside, hurry!\"\n\n\\--\n\n\"How did you know that we were at the lake?\" \n\n\"After I found Jules in your closet and saw that your bike was gone I just assumed. You used to run away to the lake often after we'd moved to Agsbury. I think you were too young to understand the full extent but your gut already knew this place was wrong. I wish mine had as well.\"\n\nOnly as we reached roads that I'd never seen before, my heartbeat started slowing down. Lately, I've been too afraid of my own family. If my dad hadn't mentioned Benny, I probably would have jumped in the water.\n\nNow I was glad that I hadn't. After my father finally, for the first time in my life, really spoke the truth.\n\n\"Agsbury was a paradise. A place that you didn't choose but had to be chosen for. If you showed enough determination and love to grow this community. We met one of their spokesmen on a holiday once. He told us about this wonderful place where families live together in happiness, where there is no crime, no hate. Of course, we didn't believe much of what he was saying at first but they get to you eventually.\n\nYou were only ten back then, we didn't have much money and little support from our respective families. \n\nAgsbury was going to fill all those voids for us. So we wrote our application and had many interviews and trials. It took almost a year until we finally received the acceptance letter. Your mother couldn't believe her eyes, I'd never seen her happier than that day.\"\n\nAlex and I stayed silent, sucking in all the words my dad was speaking. I was sitting at the front next to my dad while Alex was in the back with a fast-sleep Benny. \n\n\"There were so many rules. We weren't allowed to conceive more children, we weren't allowed to leave, even for vacation, weren't allowed to own a car. When I think about it now, I believe we were insane for wanting it but they had a way to be persuasive.\"\n\nI didn't like where things were going.\n\n\"And we were happy, we'd convinced ourselves to be. Your mother especially. Even when she learned about the ritual. Once a year a family is chosen, often it happens when their youngest child turns 18. I want to spare you the horrifying details but these families never truly leave Agsbury. They believe, and I used to as well, that dying and becoming a part of Agsbury's grounds was the greatest honor. The town feeds on the dead and pays its residents with good fortune.\"\n\nMy stomach started turning. \n\n\"But wait. We moved here before Benny was born. This isn't adding up,\" I said.\n\nMy dad nervously looked through the mirror at Benny. \n\n\"They don't always wait until the child turns 18. He needed a new family.\" \n\nI looked at the sweet face of the boy I only knew as my brother and couldn't help but imagine what they'd done to his parents. This couldn't be real. \n\n\"Dad, where are we going?\" \n\nHe took a deep breath.\n\n\"We are getting away before they notice that the car is gone. Where to, I'm not sure yet.\"\n\nHe looked at Alex.\n\n\"I know this is a lot for you too, I'm sure you don't want to leave your parents but-\"\n\nHe stopped talking. \n\n\"Why now?\" Alex suddenly asked.  \"Why should we even believe you? I know you were there on my first night, why didn't you help us?\" He was almost shouting now.\n\n\"Because I needed time to become myself again. Normally, when a new family comes their children are still pretty young. They can be persuaded easily. For you it was hard, your parents tried to talk you into it but you couldn't be convinced. But they wanted this so much and showed all this determination. They'd have done anything. And I saw it on the night you moved in.\"\n\nWe were going paths I'd never seen before, luckily with no people in sight. I can't believe other residents haven't tried to flee. I wondered how people could be persuaded so easily but remembered that I'd been the same until now.\n\n\"But the moment something in my mind really shattered was when I heard them call you by your real name. Charlie,\" my dad continued.\n\nAlex and I exchanged a confused look.\n\n\"It reminded me how they wipe everything from our old lives. You having the current name of my daughter,\" he looked at Alex through the mirror. \"It reminded me of her real one.\"\n\n\"Lucia,\" I whispered. \n\nA tear was forming in the corner of my dad's eye.\n\n\"I am so sorry for everything we've done to you, children. I pulled you aside that night,\" he was talking to Alex again. \"Pressured you to not forget your name, I thought I could do *something* at least. But it took me some time to collect the courage and formulate my plan. I wanted to get more children out of there but they have very smart ways to trick the outside world as well. If I went to the authorities, they'd only put me in jail for kidnapping.\"\n\nI felt like I would throw up any second.\n\n\"Dad, what about mum?\" \n\n\"Your mother would happily die to become soil for the grounds of Agsbury. And she'd take us with her. For now, we need to save [ourselves](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/).\"",

        "text": " I was never one for cave exploration. In fact, I'd always been deathly afraid of the dark, cramped spaces. But as a sergeant in the military, I didn't have a choice when I was assigned to a special ops team in Iraq.\n\nIt was 2003 and our team was on a mission to take out a group of high-ranking terrorists in the mountains. We'd been at it for weeks, trudging through the harsh terrain and dealing with the scorching heat.\n\nSo when one night we started hearing strange noises coming from a nearby cave, close to where we were sleeping, my commanding officer didn't hesitate to send me and another soldier, a young private named Jones, to investigate.\n\nI tried to protest, but the sergeant was having none of it. \n\n\"You two have the best weapons,\" he said gruffly. \"I need you to go in there and see what's making those noises. And be careful!\"\n\n“But what makes those sounds? Some animals?” I asked.\n\n“I have no fucking idea, but it’s loud and strange,” the sergeant responded. “I hope it’s not Iraqi forces hiding there. If you see any of them, immediately call for backup. It can be a secret base or whatever.”\n\n“Why would we hear such noises from a hidden Iraqi base?” Jones asked. “It can’t be an OPFOR base, they would stay silent, trying to stay hidden. I think it’s just some stupid animal.”\n\n“Well, you’ll find out in no time,” the sergeant said. “Be back before midnight.”\n\nI swallowed hard and tried to steady my nerves as Jones and I made our way into the dark cave, our flashlights our only source of light. \n\nAs we moved deeper into the cave, the strange noises grew louder and more distinct. It sounded like a cross between a growl and a hiss, and it sent shivers down my spine.\n\nI knew we were in way over our heads, but it was too late to turn back. We had to find out what was making those noises, no matter the cost.\n\nWhatever it was, it constantly made these strange sounds. It ended for one or two seconds, then it started again. \n\nThe cave was a twisted, winding labyrinth of darkness. As we made our way deeper into its depths, the air grew colder and damper. The walls seemed to close in around us, and I could feel the weight of the mountain above us bearing down.\n\nOur flashlights barely penetrated the thick darkness, casting shadows that seemed to dance and writhe along the walls. The floor was slippery beneath our feet, and I could feel the wetness seeping through my boots.\n\nThe strange noises echoed all around us, seeming to come from every direction at once. It was impossible to tell how far we had to go, or what lay ahead. All I knew was that we had to keep moving, to find out what was making those noises and put a stop to it.\n\nI tried to stay focused, to keep my mind on the mission. But it was hard, with the darkness and the cold and the constant, menacing sounds. I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched, that something was stalking us through the shadows.\n\nI glanced at Jones, and saw the fear in his eyes. I knew he was thinking the same thing. We were in over our heads, and there was no telling what we would find in the darkness of that cave. It was so strange, when we were sent in, we both thought it must’ve been some strange animal, but at that moment, we both feared something horrifying. The sound became louder and louder.\n\nAs we went on, the thigh cave led into a much larger space, full of other caves, all of them leading into somewhere else. There was a huge space above us, we felt like we could dig through the ceiling and immediately reach the top of the mountain. \n\n“Look, skeletons,” Jones said, pointing his gun and flashlight toward a pile of corpses.\n\n“Looks like there were really Iraqis down here, eh?” I walked closer to it. The skeletons were in military uniforms, no question, they were part of the Iraqi forces. “Can you tell how they died?”\n\n“Let’s see,” Jones kneeled beside the corpses. He had some medical knowledge, I hoped he could say something interesting. “Looks like their skull was crushed with something, but I think it wasn’t a stone. It rather looks like they were killed by some animal with a strong hand, maybe it even had claws.”\n\n“So it was just some animal, like we said. Nothing to worry about.”\n\n“Are you crazy?” he glanced at me. I could see fear in his eye. “There were armed soldiers, and something could still kill them. I think we should get the fuck out of here.”\n\n“I don’t see any weapons,” I said, looking closer at the bodies. One of them had a pocket knife, but no rifles or pistols.\n\nThe strange sound was louder than before. It sounded like it was coming from one of the smaller caves. It looked like a fucking labyrinth. And I thought I could hear some Iraqi sentences too, but maybe I was just hallucinating.\n\n“Behind you,” Jones shouted, pointing his rifle towards something behind my back. \n\nI immediately raised my gun and looked behind me, and there it was. Some green creature with multiple legs and arms, I couldn’t count how many. It was kinda humanoid, but it had no eyes. Its skin was greenish, but I can’t remember any more details, my brain tries to forget it as much as possible.\n\nThe creature screamed as we both fired at it, then collapsed, soaked with its own blood.  We were almost shitting ourselves, we never saw something like that before. Then we heard even more screams. I looked around, and they were everywhere. I think there were almost 30 of those fucking things.\n\nOne jumped at Jones, hitting his head with its strange hands, then stabbing through his flesh with its terrifying claws, ripping his head from his body. \n\n“Need backup, need backup,” I shouted to my radio. “Jones is KIA, repeat, Jones is KIA. These things are everywhere, send backup immediately.”\n\nI retreated as I was still shooting at them, trying to keep them away, as they were screaming even louder with their terrible voices. I entered that one tunnel where we came from, and ran. \n\nI was lucky they didn’t follow him. I was so relieved when I finally reached the end of the tunnel, then immediately collapsed on the ground as the other soldiers were rushing towards me. \n\nI woke up in our medical tent, with the sergeant beside my bed.\n\n“What the fuck was down there?” he asked. “I sent down a fucking team of 20 after you came back, and they all died. What the hell killed them and Jones?”\n\n“I don’t know! I don’t know,” I almost cried. It was so surreal. “There - creatures, fucking creatures with tons of limbs and no eyes. And those horrible screams!”\n\n“I’ll have to speak to the higher-ups.”\n\nI don’t know who decided what to do next, but later the sergeant told me to never speak about these events to anyone. I don’t agree with this decision. These things are living underground, and they can easily kill us. [Everyone should know abut them!](https://www.reddit.com/r/polgari/)",

        "text": "There was a light dusting of snow beginning to fall as we pulled up to the school and my mom unlocked the automatic doors to let me out of the minivan.  Her work shift started an hour or two earlier than most other kids’ parents, making this early drop-off a daily routine for us.  I still wasn’t quite old enough to be trusted at home alone - at least according to her. \n\nAs I walked towards the school doors, I saw the snow begin to fall a bit heavier, the snowflakes now coin-sized blobs.  But it still wasn’t anything abnormal.  Just the usual flurries, which we were accustomed to around these parts.  \n\nMy mom drove off as I realized the front entrance of the school was still locked.  It was past 7AM, so it should have been open.  I figured the custodian was running late and looked around for other options.  \n\nI managed to find an open window and let myself in, then went to the front door of the school and unlocked it myself, from the inside.  \n\nThere were a few of us latch-key kids who got dropped off an hour or two early and got picked up an hour or two late every day.  Most of us went home to do-it-yourself microwave dinners and oven-ready frozen fish sticks as our parents left for evening shifts at second jobs.  Our diets consisted of Pizza Pockets and Pop Tarts, Hungry Man and Hamburger Helper.  \n\nWe knew each other well.  \n\nThe first one to arrive was Tommy.  A rich kid with blond hair who thought he could order everybody around, just because his father owned a car dealership.  He had fancy shoes and name brand clothes, and made fun of everyone else who didn’t.  Unfortunately he was also obnoxious and most kids hated him, so he never got in with the cool crowd, despite his efforts to bribe them with invitations to lavish birthday parties and trips to his family lake house.  Nobody wanted to spend an afternoon with the kid, let alone a weekend.  \n\nHe pushed open the front doors and marched in, looking around.  \n\n“Where the hell is everybody?  This place is dead.”\n\nI realized he was right.  The school was more empty than usual.  \n\n“Don’t ask me.  I had to come in through the damn window.  It’s too cold to stand out there waiting for Gus.”\n\n“That lazy dick is probably gettin’ high on paint fumes in his supply closet.  We should go crash his party.”\n\n“I’m waiting for Brett,” I said, trying to think of an excuse.  \n\nBrett was another latch-key kid who I was semi-friends with.  I’d been to his house a half dozen times, but he was a loner.  He would just sit in his room and play video games all day if his parents and the rest of the world let him.  \n\nTommy sucked his teeth, looking annoyed.  \n\n“Why do you hang out with that loser, anyways?”\n\nI ignored this as Brett came in at that moment, shaking snow out of his black mop of hair.  It was really coming down outside now, and it looked like a blizzard was approaching.  \n\n“Hey, what’s up, man?” I said, giving Brett a fist bump.  \n\nHe was looking down at his Gameboy and only half paying attention, but he managed to complete the fist bump, blowing it up afterwards, then went back to his game again.  \n\n“Yo,” was all he said back. \n\n“What are you playing today?” \n\n“Castlevania.”\n\n“Sweet.”\n\n“Alright, let’s go wake up the stupid janitor now,” Tommy whined, in his most irritating voice, stomping his feet like a toddler being denied a popsicle at the grocery store.  \n\nBrett just ignored him and looked down at his game, continuing to play.  But I did see the faintest scowl of annoyance cross his face.  The two of them really didn’t like each other.  \n\n“Hang on.  Becka will be here any second.  Let’s just wait for her.”\n\nThe four of us were always wandering the school hallways before class.  Usually even before the teachers arrived.  We’d just kill time in the computer lab or in the library.  But Tommy always wanted to try to tell us what to do, like we were his employees.\n\nSure enough, Becka came in next, brushing snow off the shoulders of her leather jacket.  She stomped her big, black, Doc Martin boots, knocking the slush off of them.  Then she hiked her backpack up over her shoulder and came in to greet us. \n\n“This place is dead today,” she said, unzipping her coat.  “Where is everybody?”\n\nTommy looked like he was ready to explode.   \n\n“THAT’S WHAT I SAID!  Can we please go and see if we can find Gus?  Maybe that guy knows what’s going on.”\n\nThe rest of us agreed and we left the front entrance, as the snow steadily began to pile up higher and higher just outside the doors.   \n\nA handful of younger students in first and second grade came in as we were walking away, and I saw more were arriving behind them.  A lot of parents were dropping their kids off early today, trying to get into their jobs before the snow began to fall in earnest.  \n\n*\n\nWe searched all throughout the school, but found no trace of Gus.  Even in the basement, his usual hiding place, the old janitor was absent.  \n\n“Well, maybe he’s sick or something,” Becka said, as we went back up the stairs towards the main level of the school.  \n\n“Yeah, I guess.  But…”\n\n“What?”\n\n“When’s the last time Gus was sick?  Can you remember him ever calling in?  That guy is like an elderly Iron Man.”\n\nOnce we got back to the main level, I saw it was noticeably darker than usual.  \n\n“What’s going on?  Is the power out?” Tommy asked.  “Dude, this school.  If it’s not one thing it’s another.”\n\nThe power did seem to be out, although there was emergency lighting which cast a dull glow in the hallway.  Murmuring voices could be heard from up ahead, near the main entrance, and we rushed to see what the commotion was all about.  \n\nWe arrived to see the doors of the school had been covered with a six foot high wall of snow which was still pouring down from the sky.  The younger kids were huddled around one boy who had a portable radio, and they were listening to the local news broadcast.  \n\n“Finally, North Haven Elementary School is… Closed, due to heavy snowfall.  That’s right, kids!  It’s a snow-day today!”\n\nThe group of students let out a collective groan and Brett ran over to the doors, trying to force them open.  But they wouldn’t budge.  \n\nWe were trapped.  At school.  On a snow-day.\n\nA fate worse than death.  \n\n*\n\nIt didn’t take long for factions to begin forming.  Maybe it was because we’d been assigned “Lord of the Flies” recently as a reading assignment.  \n\nBrett, Becka, and I gathered what forces we could from the first and second graders and tried to formulate a plan for extrication.  We wanted out.  \n\nBut Tommy had other plans.  After a quick, failed attempt at recruitment, he resorted to threatening the first and second graders into compliance.  Young and foolish, many of them followed him, believing his promises of unlimited mini-pizza and bread pudding for any who would help him storm the kitchen.  \n\n“Our parents will come for us soon,” Becka pleaded with him.  “Don’t do this.  You’ll get us all detention.”\n\nBut Tommy didn’t listen, marching off with a formation of small children behind him, chanting a war-cry of: “BREAKFAST WILL BE OURS!”\n\n*\n\nAfter several hours of attempting to force the door open against the ever-building pile of snow, morale was getting low.  \n\nWorse yet, Brett’s Gameboy battery was at critical levels, and he was beginning to speak about changing sides.  His loud voice was carrying across the foyer, and several first graders perked up their ears at word of potential cereal and milk.  Many of us had not eaten breakfast, and the growling of empty bellies could be heard from all around.  \n\n“There’s no way he even got in there,” Becka said.  “That door is reinforced steel with a deadbolt.  Tommy’s probably still trying to get it open with a coat hanger.”\n\n“Oh really?” Tommy said, coming around the corner with a cold hotdog in his hand.  “Well, here I was coming to share with you all.  But I guess you don’t want any food.”\n\n“It’s not your food!  It belongs to the school, which means it belongs to us, too!” \n\nBrett lunged at him, looking ravenously hungry, but several first graders with ketchup smeared under their eyes like war-paint appeared out of nowhere and grabbed him.  \n\nTommy began to eat the hotdog, shoving the whole thing in his mouth and licking his fingers afterwards.  \n\n“Mmmm, that was good.  Too bad there’s none left for you guys.”\n\nHe walked away, laughing maniacally.  \n\nAnd that was how it got started.  \n\nThe Snowday war.  \n\n*\n\nBrett, Becka, and I created a triumvirate of power, ruling over the local first and second graders with a spirit of sharing and forgiveness.  \n\nWe each split the provisions we had been granted that morning by our parents, opening our lunch bags to reveal whatever hideous concoctions they had given us.  \n\nIt wasn’t pretty, but we managed to get through lunch without a microwave.  \n\nMeanwhile, the snow continued to blot out the sun, covering the windows with white shadows growing ever blacker.  The emergency power eventually died, as day turned to night, and we were left in total darkness.     \n\n\n*\n\nThings got bad in the total pitch-blackness which followed.  \n\nIf you thought a self-imposed government created by elementary school children was a warped reality, just imagine the anarchy that would ensue in an atmosphere of total darkness.  \n\nThe first graders lost their minds initially, and a few became mad with the power of invisibility, pinching their classmates and sneaking up on them mercilessly, until a couple kids sounded like they were on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  \n\nA light appeared suddenly out of the darkness, and I realized it was a flashlight.  The dark shape behind it was tall, and I realized it was a man coming down the hallway towards us.  \n\nEventually his familiar face came into focus.  \n\n“GUS!?”\n\n“Hey, kids.  Sorry it took me so long to get in here.  I managed to climb in through a hatch on the roof.  Now come on, I’m getting you all out of here.”\n\nWe were all relieved beyond words.  I ran over to Gus and hugged him tightly, crying as he patted my back.  \n\nThe first and second graders came and joined me, and we all held him in an embrace.  \n\nAnd then I heard a sound, like a huge metal stake being driven through a piece of meat. \n\nI felt something warm and wet dripping down onto my head from above, and heard a raspy gurgling sound.  \n\nGus’s flashlight fell to the floor with a loud clatter, and in the glow of it I saw him collapse to the floor - a spear fashioned from a sharpened yardstick protruding from his throat.  His hands were reaching up to grab it, to pull it out.  But his lips were turning blue, his breathing becoming more desperate.  \n\nAnd without warning, he was completely still, and I realized the old janitor was dead.  \n\nThe group of us looked back to see Tommy standing there with a twisted smile on his face.  He had several more spears clutched in one hand, and he pulled one out from the rest, holding it up like a javelin he was preparing to throw.  \n\n“Nobody leaves!  I’m the leader of this place!  None of you are allowed to go anywhere!”\n\nTommy had clearly gone mad with power at some point overnight.  I noticed none of the kids were with him anymore and hoped they were okay.  \n\n“We’re getting out of here, Tommy,” I said.  “With or without you.”\n\nHe lifted another yardstick spear and threw it without warning.  The sharpened point of it flew straight at my head as he screamed an incomprehensible warcry.  \n\nBrett did the unthinkable.  He dove in front of me, his Gameboy clutched in his hand.\n\n“NOOOoooooo,” his voice called out, in slow motion.    \n\nThe small grey block of electronics took the brunt of the damage from the spear, blocking its path like a kevlar vest stopping a bullet.  The wooden projectile was sticking out from the screen as Brett fell to the floor, clutching his bleeding hand.  \n\n“Hey, thanks, man.  Come on,” I said, helping him up.  “Let’s get the hell out of here before he throws another one!”\n\nThe three of us called the other kids after us and we ran towards the gym, where it looked like Gus had come from.  Wooden spears came flying over our heads, landing on the floor of the hallway.  We stomped them beneath our feet as we ran past, and I looked over my shoulder to see Tommy preparing to throw another.  \n\nWe ducked into the double doors of the gymnasium just as a spear came whizzing past my face.  My heart was pounding with fear as I realized that it would have killed me if I’d stayed where I was for a second longer.  \n\nWe ran up onto the stage, where a cold breeze could be felt coming in through the ceiling.  The first and second graders were already climbing up the scaffolding leading to the catwalk, where the hatch could be accessed by a ladder.  \n\nAs I reached the upper level of the catwalk, I heard the gym doors crash open with a bang.  \n\nIt was Tommy.  And he was walking towards the scaffolding with murder in his eyes.  \n\nThat was when I remembered the signs down below us, which Gus had installed.  \n\nDO NOT SHAKE THE SCAFFOLDING - they read.  The structure was notoriously wobbly, and only adults were allowed to go up to the top, in order to change lights for plays and school productions.  \n\n“Get down here, or I’ll make you come down here,” Tommy said, gripping the legs of a piece of scaffolding.  \n\n“Hurry!  Get up the ladder!” I yelled to one of the kids who was still with us.  \n\nHe climbed up onto the ladder and it was just Becka, Brett, and I remaining on the catwalk.  \n\n“Alright, have it your way,” Tommy said, and began to shake the entire structure violently with his body weight, heaving the supports back and forth and making the scaffolding wobble.  \n\nThe three of us were thrown side to side, and my heart nearly stopped as I was tossed into the railing and almost went over the edge, where I would have fallen to my death far below.  But Becka grabbed my wrist and pulled me back, and we struggled towards the ladder.  \n\n“NO!  YOU CAN’T LEAVE!” Tommy shouted as he realized we were getting away, despite his deadly efforts.  “YOU CAN’T!  YOU’RE NOT ALLOWED!”\n\nHe shook the scaffolding even harder, and I heard something snap just as I grabbed the bottom rung of the ladder.  \n\nThe entire structure collapsed beneath me in an instant, and I heard Tommy’s cries of outrage cut short as it crushed him beneath its weight.  \n\nI was hanging by one hand from the ladder, and my fingers began to slip as my sweaty palms lost traction.  \n\nBut just as I was about to fall, Brett grabbed me by the shirt sleeve and pulled me up out of the hatch, and we collapsed in the snow on the roof.  \n\nWe laid there in the cold frost, breathless and exhausted, starving and terrified, and looked up to see the sun was shining in the sky.  \n\nThe storm had ended.  \n\nAnd the snow would melt.  \n\nAnd soon, school would be back on [again.](https://youtube.com/@JordanGrupe)\n\n[JG](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[TCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)",

        "text": "  \n\nI messed up. I messed up so bad. I don’t know if I’m in danger or going to jail or what, but oh God did I fuck up. I don’t know how I’m going to live with myself.\n\nThis all started in the break room Wednesday. As I shoved my leftover Chinese into the microwave; Brian leaned back in his chair, inviting Dave to come over Saturday to “light up the pit” for his birthday. A small gathering, he said. I never get invited to those things. Never. I tell myself it’s because I’m in lower management, but I know the truth. I’m awkward around people. I try too hard.\n\n“Man, I used to do a mean smoked chicken back in the day!” I interrupted. I’d never smoked a chicken in my life. But I felt confident no one would be asking me to. “Have a great party, Brian.” I don’t know why I butted in. I guess I was just tired of being ignored.\n\nAs I reached for the door, fried rice steaming, Brian invited me to the party. I stopped, hand just short of the knob, sure I’d misheard. I know it’s dorky to admit, but I had to shove my grin down a couple notches to avoid looking like Patrick Bateman as I turned back around and accepted.\n\nI still remember what I told him. “Aw man, I’m great at gifts! I’ll see you there!” *Stupid, stupid, stupid!!*\n\nIn truth, I’m awful at gifts. I’d been sitting on my sunken couch looking around online for ideas for nearly an hour with no luck. Finally, I settled on a gag gift. Something that could be re-gifted amongst the cool guys in the office, occasion after occasion. I wasted another 15 minutes fantasizing about the guys passing the gift around and talking about how I started it all. How witty and funny I was. I could be an office legend.\n\nI know it’s crude, but Brian had said it would be a small gathering. I figured a few guys from the office and maybe an old friend or two. I decided to take inspiration from my college days and scour the internet for a sex doll.\n\nI sucked my breath as I scrolled through the outrageous prices. Just as I was about to give up and go with an old-fashioned blow-up doll, I found a listing from BadDollz4u and she was *perfect*. The doll’s name was listed as Alice. The brief description under the picture proclaimed, “A Taste of Wonderland!” I couldn’t help but chuckle.\n\nBlond hair, blue eyes, and just over $100 with overnight shipping included. The fleeting thought occurred to me that at that price point, she might be used. But honestly, did it matter? No one was going to be partaking in any activities with her. At least I hoped not. She was to be the white elephant gift passed among the guys. She was the legacy I’d leave behind as I moved my way up management. She was how the guys would know deep down, I was one of them and they could invite me to bar crawls and parties. She would deliver me from this god-awful loneliness. *God I was so stupid.*\n\nWithout any more hesitation or reading, I pressed “Buy Now”. \n\nI was giddy. She was perfect. I laid in bed that night fantasizing about the shock on Brian’s face as he opened the gift. The guys would howl with laughter. They’d slap me on the back, give me some high fives. It was going to be great.\n\nThe following morning, I woke with an extra pep in my step. I hummed while I ran the steamer over my collared shirt and gave myself a foamy grin in the mirror as I brushed my teeth. As I strolled to the kitchen to grab my cup of Joe, there was a swift knock at the door.\n\nIt couldn’t be… Not this early? And yet when I opened my apartment door, there stood a large box. I was elated! I dragged the box in quickly and slammed the door shut.\n\nIn my excitement, I ripped the box open like a wild animal. I tore the packing sheet off the top and paused. She was beautiful, sure, but she wasn’t exactly as the ad had shown. Her blond hair was a bit matted, like a childhood doll forgotten in the bottom of a toy box. One eye was a clear crystal blue, the other an odd yellow. Her freshly oiled bondage leather attire shone in the light. Maybe she wasn’t perfect, but she’d do.\n\nWith only ten minutes before I needed to leave for work, I roughly brushed through her hair. She wouldn’t win any awards, but she was smoother than before. \n\nGlancing back at the destroyed box, I realized I wasn’t sure where to put her. My first thought was to just leave her out, but what if there was a maintenance emergency? I didn’t want the office to think I was weird. I bit my lip and settled for the closet. I shoved her in quickly and went out the door.\n\nWork dragged on. Everything seemed so trivial knowing the work I had cut out for me at home. I had decided to pull Alice’s hair into pigtails to further smooth her hair and give her another once over to make sure I hadn’t missed anything else in my morning fumble with her.\n\nThe guilt of cutting out fifteen minutes early from work didn’t haunt me like it generally would. I swung my apartment door open and bellowed, “Honey! I’m home!”\n\nMy chuckle was cut short as I entered my bedroom and found Alice lying on top of the comforter on my bed. I froze. Someone had been in my apartment and they had moved her.\n\nI slowly approached the bed, looking Alice over. She certainly looked the same. But nonetheless, I decided to call the office to see if maintenance had been through. According to the impatient woman who answered, no one had entered my apartment.\n\nAn eerie feeling swept over me, but I figured in my excitement this morning, I’d opened the closet door but for some reason laid Alice on my bed. I was excited and I must have been in a rush. I’m forgetful sometimes.\n\nRegardless, my enthusiasm had withered. I pulled and smoothed Alice’s hair into pigtails before placing her into the closet and firmly shutting the door.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more it made sense that I’d been careless this morning. I’d spent a good chunk of the night lost in thought about my perfect surprise. I’d just hit the hay a little earlier tonight. I’d power through tomorrow, and the following day was the party. \n\nAfter a quick TV dinner, I slid into bed. The thought of Alice laying there staring up at the ceiling returned. I rolled over a few times, but eventually sleep came.\n\nI jerked awake suddenly to the terrible certainty that someone was staring at me. I was cemented on my back with my eyes fluttering quickly at the ceiling. As my eyes adjusted, I could make out something hovering a few inches from my face.\n\nI stifled a scream as I slowly turned my head towards the figure in the dark. Alice was bent down on all fours with her mouth stretched open far too wide for what she was intended for. Something in my brain, something primal that had helped my ancestors survive in the forest with carnivorous beasts, told me with great certainty that if I hadn’t awakened when I had, she’d have eaten me. Her mouth would have continued to pop and stretch like a snake and she’d have swallowed me whole.\n\nI shoved her hard and leapt onto my feet on the other side of the bed. Terror gripped me as I scrambled to escape my bedroom.\n\nI threw my gaze back into my room, expecting Alice to be yanking at the knob from the other side with her jaw jiggling unhinged at her chest, but nothing moved through the crack in the door. I flipped the light from the other side of the doorway and waited. I held my breath, but I couldn’t hear anything over the roaring of my blood pressure in my ears. Slowly, I cracked the door completely open.\n\nI climbed back onto the bed and leaned over to see Alice sprawled out on the floor. Her head was turned sideways at an angle that begged a broken neck. Her yellow eye stared dreamily under my bed. She looked different. Paler, almost grey. Her youthful cheek were now sunken. She looked long since dead.\n\n“Hey!” I yelled. I didn’t expect her to answer, but there was a flood of relief when she didn’t flinch. *She won’t move as long as I’m watching her*. I didn’t know where the thought had come from, but I knew it to be true.\n\nI reluctantly turned to boot up my laptop. I realized far too late that I should have read the rest of the ad. Something was very, very wrong with this doll.\n\nAlice was marked as “Out of Stock” but the ad was still there to read.\n\n“A Taste of Wonderland! The perfect doll for your enemy. Let her ravishingly good looks lull them into a false sense of security before this sweet Alice transforms into a cutthroat Queen of Hearts! Off with their heads! Just 3 days until your sweet, sweet revenge! Alice will eliminate her owner on the third day, so please make sure she has been gifted to a new owner before that time. We advise leaving no return address, this isn’t a gift you want returned to you! Happy haunting!”\n\nMy stomach felt full of ice. I was going to die. This god damn doll was going to kill me. I threw my laptop against the wall and sobbed.\n\nI went to the garage, grabbed some leftover cheap rope from my room and two old bike locks and went to work tying Alice up. I didn’t know what I was going to do yet, but I couldn’t risk her moving around anymore. I’d die of a heart attack before she ever had a chance to kill me. Although, at the moment, this might not be the worst way to go. ‘*Off with their heads!’* flashed through my mind.\n\nSleep didn’t find me again that night, but in the early hours of the morning, I had made a decision. I didn’t want to die. I would go to work, keep up appearances, and on Saturday I would give Brian the doll. \n\nAt work that morning, I was utterly distracted. Alice was bound on my couch, but the thought of not being able to see her worried me. At noon, I shut my office door. I jumped when my coworkers knocked and nearly vomited when the phone rang. At some point, I’d have to go home. At some point, I’d have to wrap Alice up, stick a shiny bow on her, and give her to Brian. At some point, I’d be a murderer.\n\nDespite my want to get everything over with, I found myself the last to leave the office. I stopped quickly at the store for wrapping paper. I meant to go straight home after and deal with Alice, but I stopped at the bar for a few drinks first.\n\nLightly stumbling, I entered my home. As I flicked on the light, my heart shot out of rhythm. I slammed my first against my chest twice before the cramp in my chest subsided. Alice wasn’t how I’d left her.\n\nShe stood in the center of the living room with her head tilted back, one hand raised in a fist, holding a butcher knife ready to thrust towards the ceiling like a victor’s battle sword. She looked more rotted corpse than beauty.\n\nI’d had enough of this fucking doll. I pried the butcher knife from her gnarled hand and laid her down on the floor. I had no thoughts as I wrapped her. When I was done, she resembled a dead body wrapped in tacky wrapping paper instead of a sheet. *Happy fucking birthday indeed.*\n\nI couldn’t wait anymore. I couldn’t risk her unwrapping herself. I took Alice with me and propped her against the garage wall as I reclined the passenger seat all the way and shoved her inside. I had no idea what I’d tell law enforcement if I was pulled over, but I couldn’t risk not keeping an eye on her.\n\nJust after 11:45, I cut my headlights as I pulled in front of Brian’s house. I nearly left. I started to cry again. I’d even switched the car back into drive with my foot pushed heavily on the break, but the wrapping paper faintly rustled. Exhausted and bordering on a psychotic break, I shoved the shifter back into park and got out of the car. Carefully, quietly, I took Alice to the door. I rang the doorbell four times fast and ran to my car. My tires squealed as I tore away from the house with just enough time to see Alice fall through the opening door.\n\nI didn’t go to Brian’s party. I couldn’t. Guilt feasted on me through the weekend. I barely ate. Barely slept. When I did, Alice was there, butcher knife in hand, rotted flesh flapping from her jawline as she screamed in a dying animatronic voice, “Off with their heads!”\n\nToday is Monday. I’m sitting at my desk. We’ve been open for just over an hour.\n\nBrian hasn’t showed up or called in.\n\nJust before I posted this, I went back and checked BadDollz4u’s ad. I wanted to reread it. To make sure I didn’t miss anything. The ad has been updated.\n\n“1 Left in Stock! Order Now!”",

        "text": "Years ago, I worked 2nd shift and drove 30 miles home in the dead of night, five days a week. The route I took was a country highway which was the most direct route with the least traffic. It passed through a few towns along the way, but it mostly wound through cornfields and dark woods. It wasn’t the kind of road where you’d expect to encounter a hitchhiker but that’s exactly what I saw. Or, so I thought.  \n\nThe first time I saw him, I was about halfway home, approaching a point on the highway where it curved left to cross a bridge over a river. As I rounded the curve, I suddenly saw a man in my headlights. He was standing on the shoulder of the road with his thumb out.  He was elderly. Very tall and skinny with gray hair. He was wearing a distinctive red blazer. What I remember most is how ghastly white he looked against the black woods. White skin. White hair. Pale eyes looking right at me. I was so startled that I almost hit the brakes but I instantly thought better of it and continued on. As I drove past him, I could see his hair looked wet even though the night was dry.  \n\nAbout a week later at the same spot, the same man came running out of the woods into the highway about 100 yards ahead of me, waving his arms and shouting. I had to swerve around him, I barely missed him and nearly drove off the road, skidding to a stop on the shoulder. I could hear him running up the road behind me, shouting something crazy about the world coming to an end. IT’S THE APOCALYPSE! IT’S THE END OF DAYS! I hit the gas and drove away as fast as I could. When I looked in the rearview mirror, I saw nothing.  \n\nI stopped at the State Police barracks that night and made a report. They asked me what he looked like, and how he was dressed. I described him. They told me other people had seen him along the highway. He was probably homeless or mentally ill, they said. They were keeping an eye out. I felt relieved that I wasn’t the only one who had encountered him.  \n\nAbout a week or so after, I was approaching the bridge and I felt somebody tap me on my shoulder from the back seat. I nearly crashed the car pulling over! Terrified, I jumped out of the car and ran about 100 feet down the road but, of course, there was nobody else in the car. I knew that. I drove the rest of the way home that night with the dome light on and the radio blasting.  \n\nI’ve thought really hard about that particular experience. That wasn’t my imagination. I hadn’t fallen asleep behind the wheel. It was three deliberate taps—tap, tap, tap—on my right shoulder, like from a long bony finger. I shudder thinking about it today.  \n\nNot long after that night, I read an article in the paper. A missing man from a nearby town had been found in his car, sunken in the river under that bridge. He was a hotel desk clerk who had vanished earlier in the spring after leaving work one night. His family thought he’d met with foul play and police thought he’d just run away. As it turns out, he’d missed the curve and had driven down the embankment into the river below. Road workers saw tires poking out of the water and when they winched out the car, they found him inside. I imagined he was still wearing his work uniform, including the red blazer. And for him, the world really did end that night.   \n\nSo, during those weeks when I was seeing the crazy hitchhiker, that poor man was right there under the bridge, waiting to be found. I’m still not convinced that I saw his ghost, not really. I’m very agnostic about these things. But I learned to take the long way home on a well-lit, well-traveled interstate highway. Even today, I avoid driving on country drives in the dead of night. \n\nAnd sometimes I wonder if those lonely people I sometimes see along the side of lonely highways are all ghosts just trying to find their way home. ",

        "text": "Disclaimer: This has been written and posted by my friend due to my circumstances. \n\nI started to lose my eyesight when I was 14, each year my prescription got stronger and stronger until I was practically blind without my glasses. It didnt stop me from doing most things, I still got through school, went to college, got the job I always wanted which was to be a teacher. \n\nI lost my hearing when I was 27, turns out I have Usher Syndrome which had been in slow development. This caused me to also lose my job... No one wants a teacher who can't hear anyone I guess. I moved back in with my parents and I did the odd jobs for them that they needed in order to feel useful and to make their generosity feel less like pity. Learned how to sign and how to read braille. Our family was small, just the three of us as our only relatives were distant both physically and emotionally. We didn't have a lot of money and no health insurance so I couldn't get anything to help me get my hearing back but my parents were trying their best to save up enough for me to get hearing aids someday.\n\nI lost my parents at 29, they were on a train back from the city where they worked when it derailed as it was passing over a bridge. It left me with nothing. Their house was rented, they had enough savings to keep me in there for a few months once I had their funeral paid for. I had no one else, my condition had put me in a state of self pity over the last few years that I had pushed away any friends I had once had. Eventually I was living on the streets, begging for any food and sleeping in crudly made cardboard structures. I've been living like this for a year now.\n\nMy glasses broke last week. \n\nPeople say that when you lose at least one of your senses another enhances. I had never experienced this up until now. But lying in my cardboard shelter in some long forgotten tunnel I had a lot of time to focus on what I could feel, as it was my only way to survive now. I had a few bottles of water, a few cans of food that I had been given by strangers so I wasn't in immediate danger but I knew that I was in deep trouble in the long term. I learned to feel my way through the tunnel, finding the nearby park to relieve myself when I couldn't wait any longer. I didn't dare go further away, I wasn't sure I would ever make it back again if I did. My whole world became about touch. \n\nA few days later I was lay in my shelter when I felt a sharp cramp in my stomach that had me doubled over in pain. The previous night I had finished off a tin of what I think was jackfruit, but this place isn't sanitary so God knows if it was the food or something else but bottom line was my insides were twisting in knots. I could feel the red hot pulsing of my intestines as they revolted against me. It was hours until it subsided and I'm embarrassed to say that I couldn't make it out of my tunnel to the park. \n\nBut anyway, enough about my bathroom struggles, here is what I'm trying to tell you. That was the start of it all. When the pain subsided I felt my insides slowly relax to normal, fitting comfortably back into place amongst one another. My heart was steady again, my stomach produced the acid it had been forcing me to vomit up not one hour ago. My intestines eased and I could even feel them cooling down. It was this realisation that had me seizing right back up again but this time in terror. \n\nI know your first thoughts might be something along the lines of 'that doesn't seem like such a big deal', but can you take a moment to imagine what it must feel like? To feel everything 24/7. I can't hear anymore but I can feel the blood being pumped through my body. I can feel where my organs touch one another. Where the roots of my teeth are sitting in my gums. Everytime I breathe and my lungs expand they push into the other organs nearby and I feel it everytime. I've stopped eating and drinking because I can't stand the feeling of the digestive process. I can feel that part of the throat that opens and closes to consume something, I never even knew that existed until now! Then the hours of digestion which feels unending, I can feel my stomach breaking it all down and then it moving through my intestines to continue the process. I try to lay completely still so that I'm using as few muscles as possible as I can't take the movement or the tearing.\n\nIt's as if the more time that passes the more extreme it gets, the more I can feel. Yesterday I started to feel the hairs on my body slowly grow from their roots. But that seems like nothing now... Did you know that the human body has tiny bugs inside and out? I do now. They are in my eyes, all over my skin, in my stomach... everywhere. I can feel them all crawling and I feel it all the time. My skin is alive with the march of a million insects. \n\nI don't know how much longer I can take this. A homeless friend of mine paid me a visit today and is writing this in hopes somebody out there can help me. I can't wait much longer, I know I don't have long left. My brain is changing, it's not behaving like it should and I can feel that it's sick. This condition is sending me mad. \n\nPlease help me.",

        "text": "Me (18M) and my mother (56F) recently found out that my grandpa who died 5 years ago owned a parking lot in an underground area. \n\nYesterday, my mother decided that it was time to take advantage of the parking lot since it was located near the city center and finding a place to park during Christmas isn't easy. We drove toghether to my grandparent's house to get the keys. She is keeping all his things, inculing the key in a drawer. We took the two keys and headed our way to the parking. Even though it was near the city center, the whole neighborhood was old and abandoned.\nI could already tell there was something odd in the atmosphere but I completely ignored it thinking my mind was messing with me.\n\nWe opened the main garage door. An extremely disgusting smell came out and I asked my mother to leave since I had a creepy feeling. She said that I'm watching too many thrillers and that everything is fine so we kept on going while it was getting darker and darker. After a minute I had to open my phone's flashlight. For some reason my mother refused to open hers. We went down some brick stairs and got to the first level. Newspapers from the 80's and brocken beer bottles where everywhere.\n\n- \"I doubt anyone has been here the last decade.\" I said.\n\nMy mother didn't reply. I froze. Where was my mother? \n\n-\"mum?!\" I yelled.\n\n-\"mum where the have you gone?! Please show up this isn't funny\"\n\nStill no answer. I started running behind in hopes of finding her but she was nowhere to be found. I started stressing out while still yelling to find her. I went back to the exit of the parking and while getting closer to it my hands touched something. A wall? How the hell could the exit just disappear in front of my own eyes? My mind was messing with me. I sat down and closed my flashlight to save up some battery. Then, I opened my phone just to find out my battery was at 11%. I immediately tried to call 911 and then my girlfriend but there was obviously no signal. I forced myself to calm down in order to think clearly but I eventually ended up crying. After 15 hopeless minutes I was about to get up when I heard a creepy \"crack\". It sounded like glass shattering into pieces. My heart almost stopped. I froze. Thinking it was my mother I opened my flashlight and run towards the sound. Then I saw it. A dark, short figure with round eyes looking through my soul. I begun running in a random direction while screaming at the top of my voice in terror. Out of the corner of my eye I saw it crawling away. In a matter of seconds I had reached a dead end. Too afraid to open my flashlight again I am standing in a corner. My only hope is that this thing is an illusion. After writing all of this my battery is at 5%. It may be a fault but I wanted to prevent YOU from coming down here. But if you are ready to encounter the creepy thing and my soon dead body you are welcome. While posting this I am sure that I am stuck here. Without my mother or anyone else. In an underground parking lot. Alone. Or probably not.",

I jolted awake the hair on the back of my neck tingling.\nI turned very slowly, my heart thumping so loud i felt faint. \nWhat i saw made me scream as loud as i could. \nIn the little attic window was my mother hanging upside down staring at me.\nHer head was completely twisted around and her yellow eyes and black teeth were glinting in the moonlight. \nI knew that i had to get back down the attic stairs and escape for my life because any minute now my mother would smash her way through the window. I could hear and see the glass splintering as she rapped her large talon like claws against the glass.",

        "text": "I originally tried to post this on r/wendigo but it doesn't look like that's really possible anymore so I copied what I had and I'm pasting it here. I'll re-read it and see if there's anything I need to change because of that, but I can't guarantee I won't miss anything.\n\nIt's 4:27 AM right now. At 2 AM, I heard the loud screeching sound of a wendigo coming from outside my apartment, which I recognized from [this video](https://youtu.be/m6IW2DoizbE) I saw a long time ago, and I went and watched it again to verify that's the sound I heard and it was pretty damn close to that. I also just got a really bad feeling about what I was hearing right off the bat. I was in the living room of my apartment at the time, and the outside light was still on. I turned it off as soon as I heard the screech, without stopping to consider if that was a good idea first. I definitely didn't want it to come closer to me because of the light, but turning it off after hearing it might have acknowledged that I heard it. But, no going back after that, turning it back on to try to \"undo\" that possible mistake didn't really seem like an option. So I went online to look stuff up about this for a while, then unmuted my TV and went back to playing Stardew Valley for about another hour or so. Then I'm wrapping up, getting ready to call it a night. I turned off the TV, then turned off the living room light - which you can see very clearly from outside whether it's on or not through the blinds. Big mistake. After I turned that light off, I immediately heard it again. Immediately, like it was in response to it. I can't say it was any louder or quieter than the first time, at least not by a noticeable amount. I didn't have the same mentality as before of not going back on my light switching decisions. I turned that shit back on right away. Fuck being alone in the dark with that, even if it's outside and I'm not. It's not like I had any doubt it had taken notice of me by then anyways, that ship had already sailed in my mind. I still haven't turned that light off, and I might just leave it on all night now. I'm not really sure if I'm safe, but I also need to go to bed soon.\n\nFor context: not sure if any of this matters, but I live in Florida and there's a cemetery like, less than a quarter mile away from my apartment. I've never really been bothered by it or thought about it much, but it did sound like it *might* have been coming from that general direction. I also saw some people out there when I was coming home after midnight not long ago doing... I don't really know what, but definitely nothing they had permission to be doing at that hour. I'm only just now connecting the dots that whatever happened then and there might have something to do with this.",

        "text": "I 18m passed away from cancer this past April. I visit family often but primarily stay in the town I passed away in since my sister goes to college in that town. Im currently in her room watching her sleep. I find it soothing. Almost peaceful knowing she is safe and sound and somehow making it through the toughest part of her life. I see how much she struggles knowing I’m around anymore. \n\nI make my usual rounds during the day since I know my sister is usually busy and I prefer to keep tabs on her throughout the night unless she’s taking a shower or on the phone with people before she goes to bed. \n\nDeath has been a different experience. I don’t feel pain like I did before. I never get sick. I always feel “free” and carefree. I also get pretty much anything I want. I also got to meet family I never knew I had which has been a blessing. I met a sibling I knew I had but passed away before they were born. I met my sister’s daughter who would’ve been five this year had she lived. There has been so many things I’ve gotten to experience that I wouldn’t had cancer not taken me. \n\nI’ve also been able to go see all of my friends and see what kind of lives they’ve been living. Some of them are close to graduating high school. Some are signing their athletic contracts to colleges. Others are figuring out life and that’s ok. I’m still proud of each and every one of them. Honestly, I may not have known what I wanted to do once I graduated high school, but I knew I didn’t want to disappoint anyone in my family. But I also know I didn’t wanna follow in my sister’s footsteps going off to a big four year university. \n\nMy sister keeps tossing and turning. I really want to hug her. I just don’t want to disturb her. Maybe I should shut her TV off so she isn’t wasting electricity but I know she can’t sleep well without it. It’s nice to see for once she has her room decorated during the school year. She never decorated her dorm rooms which always frustrated me. Maybe I should play with the light switch and wake her up just to mess with her. I don’t want to scare her though. I know she’s tired. She’s dealt with a lot this past week. Man, I tear up thinking about how great she’s doing. I just wish I was there in person to tell her how proud I am of her…. Little does she know I woke her up to have her write this for you all to read… \n\nIf my family see this, I miss you all. Deeply. I love you all. Deeply. I see you. I’m watching you. Continue to keep doing you. You all are doing great. I will see you all soon. I hope you guys see this.",

        "text": "i had been struggling with schizophrenia for as long as i could remember. i was constantly hearing voices in his head and seeing things that weren't really there. Despite this, i had managed to hold down a job and maintain a small circle of friends who were always there for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, my paranoia reached a new level. I knew that there was a man following me everywhere i went, a man with a hat that seemed to change shape and color every time i saw it. his name is \"the hat man,\" and I knew  that the hat man was trying to kill him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite the reassurances of his friends, I became increasingly paranoid and isolated. I stopped going to work and stopped answering calls from my friends. I knew  that they were all in on it, that they were all working with the hat man to try and get him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne night, I just snapped. I grabbed a kitchen knife and stormed out of my apartment, i knew that the hat man was lurking in the shadows. I walked through the streets, slashing at anyone who crossed me. By the time I was done, six of my \"friends\" lay dead at my feet.\n\nAs I walked through the dark streets, I could feel the hat man's presence looming over me. Every time I turned a corner, I was sure I would see the hat man standing there, staring at him with his beady eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite my fear, I was determined to confront the hat man. I knew that he couldn't let the voice in my head control me any longer. I had to stand up to it, no matter how scared I was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I walked, I could feel the hat man's presence growing stronger. I knew that he was getting closer. Finally, I turned a corner and saw the hat man standing there, just as I had always known he would.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hat man was tall and thin, with a face that seemed to shift and change every time Jack looked at it. He wore a hat that seemed to glow with an otherworldly light, and his eyes were white and empty .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite his fear, I stood his ground. I knew that I had to confront the hat man if I ever wanted to be free of my paranoid delusions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Who are you?\" I yelled, my voice shaking .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hat man didn't respond. He just stood there, staring at me with his cold, empty eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What do you want from me?\" I shouted, my voice growing more desperate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, the hat man didn't respond. He just stood there, watching Jack with a cold stare on his face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith a sudden surge of courage, Jack lunged at the hat man, his kitchen knife held high. But as he swung the blade, the hat man vanished into the shadows I sobbed until i got the courage to walk back to my apartment although a small part of me knew that would be the last time i step foot into that apartment.\n\nAnd as I walked home, I knew that the hat man would always be there, lurking in the shadows, waiting for me. I felt a swift sharp pain in my head my head was pouding, i could barley stand up i fell into the street. When I woke up, I was disoriented and confused. I didn't recognize my surroundings, and I had no idea how I had gotten there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in a small, bright white room with soft padding along the walls. There was a single window, but it was covered by a thick curtain, making it impossible for me to see outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to sit up, but my arms and legs were restrained by soft straps. I was strapped to the bed, unable to move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPanicked, I began to thrash and struggle, trying to free myself. But the more i struggled, the more I realized that he was trapped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the hours ticked by, I began to wonder if I would ever escape this strange, padded room. I had no way of knowing where he was or what was happening to me. All I knew was that I was alone, and that I was terrified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity, i fell asleep after sleeping for a few hours i woke up the window was open and the curtain slightly moved because of small breeze of wind, it was night i could briefly see 2 glowing white eyes in the endless void behind that window i knew it was the hatman and he was coming back for me i started screaming in fear \"NO NO NO NO\" and then i woke up.\n\n\"Good morning, Jack,\" the hat man said with a smile. \"How are you feeling?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stared at the hat man in confusion. \"What's going on? Where am I?\" I demanded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You're in a hospital, Jack,\" the hat man said gently. \"You had a psychotic break, and you attacked six of your friends. You're lucky to be alive.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the hat man spoke, the memories of the previous night came flooding back to me. I remembered the hat man, and the voices in his head, and the knife in my hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd with a sinking feeling, I realized that I had been wrong all along. The hat man had never been real. It was all just a product of my illness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut as I lay there, strapped to the bed, I knew that the hat man would always be with him. He would always be lurking in the shadows, a constant reminder of the horrors of his illness.",

I’m also having issues with my home internet &amp; original computer.”\n\n“Ok &amp; what kind of computer are you looking for? &amp; what exactly are the issues you’re experiencing with your internet &amp; computer?”\n\n“Well, I believe the one I have is an Apple machine so I would most likely go for their latest, uh, evolution I suppose. As for the internet connection, oh it’s very spotty indeed. Quite aggravating. As for the old computer will just cut off randomly.”\n\n“Have you tried turning the router off &amp; on again?”\n\n“Yes, I can’t unplug it though, I can’t reach behind anymore to do it. Sometimes it makes bizarre noises, a kind of..zap, or buzz perhaps? Forgive my ignorance. I have a hard time explaining these things. I’m an old man, as you can probably tell. Can I perhaps book a home visit please? I will need help to set the new computer up, but also get the old one up &amp; running. At least long enough to take the content out of it &amp; into the new one that is.”\n\n“We may be able to do home visit yes, let me see what we have available. What days’ work for you?”\n\n“Oh any. I am retired.”\n\n“Ok great. I have availabilities on Friday. May I have your address please?”\n\n“It’s a little off the beaten path, I live in Brighton, Ontario, my postal code is- “\n\n“Oh I’m sorry sir, that’s too far. We only offer services for the city of Toronto. Is it possible for you to call into the store with the old computer so we can take a look at it? We can have the new one ready for pickup too?”\n\n“I’m afraid that’s not possible, our car no longer starts. That is disappointing. Out of curiosity, what are your rates of service?”\n\n“It’s $120 an hour, but again just for the city of Toronto.”\n\n“Well, I’m in quite a bit of distress over my electronics. I have no children, &amp; my Wife is bedridden. I was hoping to perhaps use these computers for doctor visits for her, hence the urgency.”\n\n“I’m very sorry to hear th- “\n\n“I can pay you both handsomely.”\n\n“Both?”\n\n“You guys normally operate in pairs, correct?”\n\n“Yes, we do have a buddy system for safety reasons”\n\n“Quite wise. $600 each. Truthfully, there aren’t many issues I need help with bar the ones I mentioned. I’ll even throw in travel expenses &amp; supper, for good measure.”\n\n“That is very generous of you sir, but it is against company policy to venture outside the city. I hope you understand.”\n\n“Well, that is a shame. Still, I do hope you have a nice evening”\n\n“You too, thank you for your call.”\n\nThe call ends. Greg’s eyes fixate on Ambrose’s number on the phones call log as he fiddles with his pen. Later, while Greg is on lunch break, he goes to a nearby café to buy a bagel &amp; coffee. His card gets declined. Greg bluffs it off to the Cashier as a chip issue that happens often. He steps out of the queue &amp; checks his balance. All of $2.37 in his account. \n\nHe goes back to the stockroom to sit down, eating a bag of chips he managed to buy with loose change. While sitting down &amp; eating his chips, he checks his voicemail:\n\n*“Hi Greg, it’s Chris again, I am still waiting on the rent from both November &amp; December, please get back to me as soon as possible.”*\n\nGreg gets back to the store, unlocks the door &amp; flips the sign on the door from CLOSED to OPEN. Enter Julie, AKA Jules.\n\n“I am so fuckin’ late. Is Tony in today?” Jules asks, slightly out of breath.\n\n“No you’re good.”\n\n“Well he’ll see I was late on my timecard eventually but screw it. I don’t get paid enough anyway.”\n\n“I hear ya.”\n\n“I’ll clock in now &amp; then you can go on your break”\n\n“It’s fine I already took a 15, I’m done soon anyway.”\n\n“Oh… sorry about that!”\n\n“It’s ok, it happens. You know Tony’s changing the commission policy where any more than 10% absenteeism disqualifies you for getting commission?”\n\n“YOU’RE KIDDING?!” Jules replies in surprise. “Welp, there goes my bonus for the month then. I was right on track too. Not like I have mouths to feed or anything.”\n\n“You don’t have kids?”\n\n“No but I have cats. Insatiable, needy cats with vet bills.”\n\n*Jules walks out of frame to the back of the store; Greg looks back to the landline phone. He goes back to Ambrose’s number, then jots down the number on his notepad. He removes the note, folds it &amp; puts it in his pocket. Later that evening on the subway on his ride home, Greg looks at the number on the note &amp; types it into his phone.*\n\n*As Greg gets home that night, opening ramen in the kitchen he dials the number:*\n\nGre *“*Hi there, is this Ambrose? Hi yes this is Greg from Tech-Help how are you? I’m well thanks, I’m just calling back as we may be able to make an exception…”\n\n*It’s 2 days later. Greg opens the door to Jules’s car:*\n\n“I brought snacks!” Greg says, holding up a \n\n“Sweet, did you get coffee?”\n\n“Ah shit no, I completely forgot, lemme go back inside, I’ll be 10 mi- “\n\n“It’s fine, let’s just get going. I don’t want to lose any daylight. We can probably get something on the way.”\n\n“Ok sounds good.”\n\n*Greg gets in the car &amp; puts on his seatbelt. Jules starts driving.*\n\n“Sorry about the cat hair.”\n\n“All good.”\n\n“Wake n’ bake?” Greg asks, holding up a small joint.\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“You got a light?”\n\n“Yeah here:” \n\n*Jules takes a red lighter out of her pocket &amp; hands it to Greg.*\n\n“This is my lighter.”\n\n“Is it? My bad.”\n\n*Greg takes a few pulls of the joint, then passes it to Jules .*\n\n“So you know where we’re going right?”\n\n“Yep, I mapped it out last night. I’ll be your Satnav.”\n\n“Ok great coz I haven’t got a clue. I got to admit this makes me a little nervous.”\n\n“Oh he sounded like he was ancient” Greg assures her. “Nothing to worry about.”\n\n“No not that, the fact that if we get found out we get fired.”\n\n“That’s why it’s only gonna be the once. It’s serious money. I called him again to arrange it. He purchased the computer over the phone &amp; as far as Tony knows the customer picked it up when he wasn’t on shift.”\n\n“Alright, one &amp; done. Wait this is gone out, pass me the light.”\n\n“The store has been crazy quiet lately, I think we need this anyway.” *Greg hands her the lighter.*\n\n“So what computer did he purchase?”\n\n“That’s the thing; he bought the latest iMac model but completely souped out with maximum RAM and two terabytes storage. $2600!”\n\n“Holy shit, we did need this.”\n\n“Right?! We’re gonna make bank today. So, what are we feeling music-wise? Passenger is always the satnav/DJ, pass me the auxiliary.”\n\n“Oh I don’t have one…”\n\n“Radio it is then!”\n\n*Greg turns the radio on as they continue driving to their destination.*\n\n**Chapter 2: Arrival.**\n\n*(Much later in the afternoon)*\n\n“I know you said it was in the sticks &amp; all but I haven’t seen any signs of civilisation the past hour.”\n\n “I know, we’re almost there, it’s just a little furt- there! There’s the mailbox! He said we turn left at the bronze mailbox with the birds on it, up the driveway &amp; we’re there!”\n\n“Finally!” Jules sighed a sigh of relief. \n\nThey continued up the large tree-lined driveway until the house loomed in front of them. It was quite a marvel in comparison to its surroundings, completely tucked away from the world behind a fortress of trees, it was a weathered yet beautiful 2 story Victorian house. What wasn’t covered in dead ivy revealed chipped paint, yet it had maintained its impressive woodwork. There were little-to-no signs that anyone was actually living there. They park just in front of the porch. Greg opens the back car door; reaches in &amp; hands Jules a bag pack &amp; lifts out a large computer box. They both step up on the porch &amp; reach the door which boasted a beautiful stained-glass window, all the while the wood creaking under them. Greg knocks. Silence. \n\n”We’re not early our we?” Jules asks.\n\n“Nah it’s 2.30… I think I hear someone coming anyway.”\n\nThey hear the click &amp; clacks of locks being unlocked behind the door. Both Jules &amp; Greg give their best, warm, Customer smiles as the door opens. Standing before them is Ambrose. He is about 6’1”, slim, bald on the top with white whisps around the sides &amp; back. He is wearing a navy wool sweater with the collar of a white shirt underneath, black slacks &amp; plain black shoes. His face was sunken &amp; skeletal, pale except for dark skin around his piercing eyes. He smiled at them both revealing grey &amp; yellowed teeth.\n\nAmbrose: “Hello! Oh how wonderful you both came” He spoke in a slightly raspy tone with an unusual, unidentifiable accent.\n\nImmediately upon entering they were hit with a slight, stale smell in the cold air. The landing was stereotypical of an older, upper/middle-class North American home, boasting original handcrafted woodwork with a mirror &amp; side table to the right with an old coat stand. A staircase to the left leading to the upper floor, while down past it was a narrow corridor leading to what was most likely the kitchen. There was a sitting room to the left which looked as though it had been plucked right out of a 50’s interior decorating magazine &amp; hadn’t been touched since. \n\n“Would you like me to take your coats?” Ambrose asks politely. “Is that box heavy?”\n\n“That’s ok!”\n\n“Yeah I’ll keep my coat on too if that’s alright.” Greg agrees.\n\n“Ah, the cold. My apologies, I never have visitors &amp; I’m rather used to it. Oh what kind of host am I?!\n\n“That’s no problem at all sir” Greg assures Ambrose while rubbing his hands together “So as discussed on the phone with you this is Jules who will be working with me.”\n\n“Nice to meet you!” Jules declares with a warm smile.\n\n“Hope you found your way here alright. I know it’s rather secluded.”\n\n“Not a problem! So you mentioned there’s a computer in the library?”\n\n“Straight to business I see!” Ambrose chuckles. “Yes, upstairs in the library. Follow me. Oh, I do appreciate the exception you made to your rules to help an old man &amp; his wife out.”\n\n“I really love your home Ambrose” Jules says, admiring her surroundings. “May I ask how old it is?”\n\n“Oh this house has been in our family since 1840.”\n\n“That’s pretty amazing!”\n\n“Yes, well the renovations have certainly been costly. Luckily, I am comfortable so it’s been well worth it.”\n\nAs they ascend the stairs, they both gaze at the old black &amp; white photographs lining the walls &amp; newspaper clippings that appeared to be as old as newspapers have been around. Ambrose is lightly singing a melody, both Greg &amp; Jules recognise it as *I Only Have Eyes For You.* As they reach the top of the stairs, they see paintings of different eras lining the walls, some appearing to be as recent as the 20th century but some reminiscent in style of art from the Renaissance period. One in particular grabs their attention:\n\n“Oh what an amazing painting that is!” Gasps Jules.\n\nA portrait painting of a middle-aged man &amp; woman, donned in black clothes lined with pearls &amp; emeralds &amp; both wore large white, ruffled collars &amp; appeared to be of noble class.\n\n“It really is impressive. Can I ask who this painting is of?”\n\n“Those are my ancestors. Great, great Grandparents. This was painted in London, England in the 1600’s, they were a Lord &amp; Lady.”\n\nNeither one of the pair in the painting seemed to have any resemblance at all to Ambrose, with no similar facial features. The man was large &amp; frumpy in contrast to Han’s slender frame, while the woman also had a fuller face &amp; ginger hair. \n\n“If you like antiques I have an entire house full of them. Die Bibliothek ist gleich hier durch.”\n\n“Sorry?” Greg asks in confusion.\n\n“The library is just through here!” Ambrose corrects himself.\n\nAmbrose takes out a ring of keys &amp; unlocks the door to the library. The back wall is lined with old books with an old mahogany desk in the centre, &amp; a large late 90’s/early 2000’s desktop computer. Ambrose attempts to give them both a rundown of what he thinks may be wrong with the machine, albeit from a clearly ignorant point of view. Greg &amp; Jules make little effort to listen to his words as their attention has been stolen by their dust-covered surroundings, donned with curious antiques &amp; objects that are clearly not from this century. \n\nA brown, old world globe bar in the corner, a very large gold mirror on the left wall next to a grandfather clock, an ancient looking bronze helmet seemingly of Nordic origin, an Aztec-appearing green statue of what looked like a ferocious priestess wearing a headdress &amp; holding a sheath. Extraordinary medieval tapestries hung on the walls protected behind glass frames, depicting anything from wars to harvests to worship.\n\n“Here it is.”\n\n*Jules &amp; Greg make their way to the computer. Greg puts the box down on the desk while Jules takes off her bag pack &amp; sits in the office chair*. \n\n“Ok so it is technically connected to the internet, but it doesn’t seem to be working. Ambrose where is the router?”\n\n“It’s down in the basement. I can show you?”\n\n“Sure let’s go”\n\n“For the sake of efficiency, why don’t I go down &amp; checkout the router situation &amp; make sure it’s all in working order, maybe it just needs to be moved up a floor. You can set up the new computer up here &amp; maybe troubleshoot the old one to see if it’s on the computers end that the connections not working, if you’d like?”\n\n“Works for me, I brought a repeater also, so I’ll set that up here too. If I need anything I’ll text yo-“ *Jules looks at her phone &amp; realises there are 0 bars of service.* \n\n“Know what? Scratch that, I have no service. Makes sense being all the way out here. Ambrose, do you know the WIFI password?”\n\n“I’m afraid I don’t. Can I get you guys’ tea or coffee?”\n\n“It’s probably on the router, I’ll take a pic &amp; bring it up. I’d love a coffee please Ambrose.”\n\n“Me too!”\n\n“Very well then.”\n\nGreg walks out of the office while Ambrose holds the door open for him. As Ambrose closes the door behind them, he stares at Jules who is now too focused on unpacking the computer to notice him. \n\n**Chapter 3: The Web**\n\n*Ambrose opens the door to the basement &amp; pulls on the chain for the lightbulb, illuminating the staircase.*\n\n“You’ll have to forgive me, it’s the least flattering room of the house. If you want to mosey on down, I will get the coffees.”\n\n*Just as Greg reaches the bottom of the stairs, Ambrose calls for him:*\n\n“Oh &amp; Greg!”\n\n*Greg turns back around &amp; looks up the stairs at Ambrose.*\n\n“Milk &amp; sugar?”\n\n“Yes double-double for both of us.”\n\n“…Pardon?” Ambrose says confused.\n\n“Uh, I take 2 milk 2 sugar, as does…Jules.”\n\nThe lightbulb is above &amp; behind Ambrose, making him a mostly black figure now. His eyes however, looked as though they had a strange glint to them that Greg hadn’t noticed before. Greg could also make out the outline of a grin that was less friendly &amp; more menacing. Greg realises he hasn’t seen Ambrose blink the entire time they’ve been there. Ambrose stares for another second that felt like a minute, then left the basement without another word. The whole interaction made Greg uneasy. He examines his dimly-lit surroundings &amp; notices a slight green light coming from the far wall. He turns the flashlight on his phone, further illuminating the basement as he walks forward, his face narrowly avoiding a spider in its web, rolling its trappings up in its silk.\n\n*“Gross”* Greg remarks in disgust.\n\nIt was certainly the oldest appearing area of the house that Greg had seen. It was a large basement with wood flooring, tools hung on the left wall below a very small rectangular window that give practically no light, metal shelves lining the right wall donned with miscellaneous jars &amp; boxes. Oddly, there was an old stone water fountain fixed to the front wall, while there were white sheets covering furniture scattered around. Several masks hung from rope from the ceiling, some appearing of Amazonian origin while others Venetian, but all share the same quality of appearing to be several century’s old. Everything was covered in cobwebs &amp; dust, while there was a damp smell in the cold air. To the right of the front wall was the green light emanating from the router. \n\nGreg makes his way to the router &amp; hits the power button, waits a couple seconds, then turns it back on. After rolling his sleeves up, he uses his hand to trace the dusty power cable to the back of the nightstand. Greg lightly sighs. He’s going to have to move the mahogany nightstand. Greg puts the phone down by a leg of the metal shelfing, upright to light the task at hand. Greg lifts &amp; pulls it towards himself, slowly. He can feel items moving around inside, but he knows better than to open doors in a private residence where he is working. He grunts as he again lifts &amp; pulls it further out from the wall.\n\n“How are you faring?”\n\n“Christ!” Greg almost jumps out of his skin. \n\nHe turns to face Ambrose, standing with a vintage silver tray holding two small cups of coffee.\n\n“I’m sorry, you frightened me, I didn’t even hear you come down.”\n\n“No Christ here I’m afraid!” Ambrose lightly chuckles. “Your coffee.”\n\n“Oh thank you.” Greg takes a cup, blows on it &amp; then takes a sip.\n\n“mm, that’s good.”\n\n“I’m glad it’s to your liking.”\n\nAmbrose stands staring at Greg for a minute, who’s discomfort is now palpable.\n\n“So…” Greg says, looking around him.\n\n“I’ll bring the cup back up to the kitchen if you’re finished. They’re my Wife’s beloved China.”\n\n“Oh…ok sure.” \n\nGreg finishes the coffee in the cup &amp; puts it back on the tray. \n\n“May I ask your background Gregory?”\n\n“It’s just Greg actually. I’m Irish &amp; moved to Canada about 7 years ago.”\n\n“You ever hear the phrase ‘The Luck of the Irish’? Well people today take it to mean the Irish people have good fortune, while the truth is the contrary. As I’m sure you’re aware, historically speaking the Irish have had terrible misfortune, &amp; the saying was meant to infer bad luck. Just another term lost to time.”\n\n“That’s interesting! Although I should get ba- “\n\n“Born in Ireland you said?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Uncircumcised then?”\n\n*Greg’s mouth drops &amp; eyebrows raise in surprise.*\n\n“…I’m sorry” Greg states sternly “I’m not comfortable answering that.”  \n\n“Oh aha, I am sorry. You reach a certain age &amp; words just seem to fly out the mouth without consideration. I meant it as a positive though. Unnecessary mutilation, never understood it. No, it’s much better that you’re not.”\n\n*Greg is offended at the topic of conversation &amp; debating if he should just go get Jules &amp; call it a day, but he didn’t want to drag her all the way out here for nothing. Besides, he needs the money. At least he’s not harassing Jules right now.*\n\n“Oh that is a pity.” Ambrose says, eyeing Greg’s forearms.\n\n“I’m sorry?”\n\n“Your…tattoos, I believe they’re called. What a pity you ruined the skin like that.”\n\n*Greg is taken aback once again by Ambrose’s comment.*\n\n“Well I like them.” Greg says sharply. *“*If you don’t mind Sir, I need to focus on the job at hand now. Thank you for the coffee.” *Greg turns his back to Ambrose.*\n\n“A potato peeler.”\n\n“…Excuse me?” Greg rolls his eyes and looks back again at Ambrose, clear irritation in his voice now.\n\n“A potato peeler would do the trick. Peel the top layers of the skin off until there’s no more visible markings. I first thought of a cheese grater but that would be rather messy &amp; cumbersome, ha! No, a potato peeler would do nicely. Certainly, it would leave nasty scars, but I do believe that would still be preferable than those unsightly markings.”\n\nGreg leans back on the nightstand. He’s become lightheaded, nauseous, &amp; his vision is blurry. He focuses as much on the basement stairs as much as possible &amp; weakly tries to push Ambrose out of the way, but Ambrose simply takes a step back &amp; avoids him. \n\nGreg staggers towards the stairs for 2 or 3 more steps until his legs give out below him. He crawls towards the stairs, trying to shout for Jules but only managing to grunt her name. As his hands grab the second step, he feels his face become covered &amp; head yanked backwards, a zip tie closes around his neck. He is being smothered. He tries to pull &amp; frantically rip at the face-covering, but his arms are weak, &amp; he is extremely disorientated. He feels Ambrose’s hand on the back of his head, &amp; suddenly his head is quickly &amp; forcefully forced towards the step–\n\n*THUD…THUD.* \n\nGreg’s head is repeatedly slammed off the step. Greg falls to the side, silent for a moment - until a light cough is heard beneath the plastic.\n\n“You are a persistent one!” Ambrose remarks frustratedly. \n\nHe reaches in his pocket &amp; reveals a pocketknife. He pulls Greg’s head far back once again &amp; slowly slices Greg’s throat open. Blood pools on the floor as Greg gurgles blood &amp; twitches. Ambrose cleans off the blade with a handkerchief from his pocket &amp; closes the pocketknife.\n\n*Jules hears a knock at the library door followed quickly by Ambrose entering.*\n\nPardon me, don’t mean to disturb you working. Here is your coffee.”\n\n“Oh thank you!”\n\n*As Ambrose walks his way to the desk, under his breath he is singing the same song from earlier. Jules takes the cup of coffee from him.* \n\n“Is Greg still down there? The connection still isn’t working…”\n\n“He wanted me to tell you he is moving the router up a floor to the living room; he’ll be just another minute.”\n\n“Uhm, ok, well I have the new computer up &amp; ready, the old one is ready to transfer the data too. Repeater is good to go; all we need now is an actual internet connection to start the migration… Why don’t I go down &amp; hel- “\n\n“May I ask you a few questions about this machine?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\nAmbrose proceeds to ask questions about how it all function &amp; how it compares to the former &amp; the very basics such as browsing the web, which Jules patiently answers, while taking swigs from her cup. \n\nAmbrose turns his gaze from the computer screen to Jules .\n\n“You have truly magnificent skin Jules . Soft, supple, fresh. Paired with blue eyes; how lovely!”\n\n“Thank you. Is that a picture of you &amp; your Wife?” Jules nods towards a picture frame on the desk in an attempt to not only change the subject away from her, but to remind Ambrose of his marriage.\n\n“Ita quod nos.”\n\n“I’m sorry?”\n\n“Ah yes, that’s my Wife Perenna and I.”\n\n*In the black-and-white picture is a much younger looking Ambrose with a full head of hair wearing a sharp suit. Locking his arm was a beautiful woman who appeared to be of similar age. Both are standing outside the same house they are currently in, although the house looks much more newly built.*\n\n“Beautiful couple.”\n\n“Thank you. I would introduce both of you, but she is currently very ill.”\n\n“I’m sorry to hear that, Ambrose.” Jules says, with genuine empathy.\n\n“That’s quite alright. She won’t be suffering for much longer.”\n\n*Jules looks down &amp; frowns as her eyes droop.*\n\n“I’m not feeling great…”\n\n*Ambrose walks back to his armchair with the picture frame &amp; sits down, putting the picture on a side table next to him to admire it.*\n\n“Both of us have been together so long it’s all we know now. At the beginning, oh what a privilege it is! You travel the corners of the world, learning new languages, poetry, music. But when there's nothing left to be curious for, all that's left is apathy; when every sight &amp; sound, pain &amp; pleasure has become overly familiar. What does one do when your once insatiable thirst for knowledge has been quenched? \n\nI've seen the very depths of humanity's kindness, but more so it's cruelty. It's all laughably predictable. It's why we're hidden away here, but we could never be far enough. What a dream it would be to live together all the way on the moon &amp; just watch as everyone tears each other apart in their cycle of never-ending depravity. No. Nothing ever really changes. \n\nThese trinkets &amp; tchotchkes may possess monetary or historical value, but the only value they bear to me is the memories they have attached. Taking me back to when I still had a lust for life. \n\nIf it wasn't for Perenna, I would not be here now. To have someone to share all of it with, that is the TRUE privilege. To be able to share this blessing &amp; curse of life with one another. Impervious to all except an aging shell, you see. She's the only constant. The only reliable. Numb from the banality of existence &amp; repetitiveness of the world yet when I look at her, I still feel something. I still feel love, excitement, purpose. That is why I am utterly devoted to her. That is why I keep going. As long as I still have breath in my body. Time may mean nothing to me anymore, but she still means everything.”\n\n*Jules has now passed out at the desk.*\n\n**Chapter 4: Transfiguration.**\n\n*Jules’s eyes open. Her vision is blurry as she tries to focus on a black shape who appears to be cranking a mechanical device. Her head severely aches, she tries to rub the back of her head, but her hands won’t lift. She looks down at her hands. They’re tied with zip ties to a leg of the metal shelfing. She panics &amp; pulls; the leg doesn’t move. It suddenly comes back to her what she was doing right before she passed out. She looks down to see a body to her left, the head wrapped in blood-soaked plastic.*\n\n“GREG?!Oh no, no nooo… WHY?!” Jules cries.\n\n*“*Regretfully matters had gotten rougher than anticipated. I have procrastinated once again &amp; left it too long, hence the urgency. It’s such an unpleasant process every time.”\n\n*Ambrose is turning a crank in the wall that is opening a section of the floor, not unlike a trapdoor. As he continues to turn the handle, Jules can make out what looks like water. It now appeared that the stone fountain was actually a part of some bigger aquatic function, something below the floorboards.*\n\n“…What process?”\n\n“Not for you to be concerned about.” Ambrose says without turning around.\n\n*Ambrose bends down &amp; cuts off the zip tie around Greg’s neck with his pocketknife. He removes the now-red plastic off Greg’s heads. Jules looks in Greg’s dead eyes &amp; whimpers. Ambrose proceeds to pull Greg by the legs towards the opening in the floor. He then unbuttons Greg’s shirt to reveal a white shirt, with blood down the chest of it from the gash in his neck. He then removes Greg’s shoes &amp; rolls him into the opening with a splash.*\n\n“Look, whatever happened here, it’s done. We can see about working something out here Ambrose. Please, Ambrose? If you let me go it will fare much better for you in the long run than you killing both Greg &amp; I. We have a job &amp; families that will be looking for us, &amp; they will find us. \n\nIf they find you murdered Greg &amp; me, you will go to prison &amp; you will never see the light of day – or your Wife – ever again. But if you let me go, maybe there’s a chance for leniency? Maybe you can see your Wife on visitation? I will vouch for you &amp; say you were gentle with me, that you were overcome with grief when you realised what you’d done. You can say you blacked out &amp; don’t even remember killing him!”\n\n*Ambrose opens the door to the mahogany nightstand to reveal a safe. He takes keys from his pocket &amp; opens the door. He then takes out something wrapped in white cloth. Ambrose unwraps the cloth to reveal an old rock with a strange sigil engraved, visually similar to a rune.*\n\n“Does your Wife know what you’re doing Ambrose? HEY!” *She shouts, angry now.*\n\n*Ambrose ignores her. He rolls up his pants, slowly lowers himself to the edge &amp; then enters the water. The water is shallow, not even up to his knees. After rolling up his sleeves, Ambrose seems to feel the bottom of the pool with an empty hand. Then, with the hand holding the rock, he puts the rock underwater &amp; then stands up straight again, as Greg’s corpse bobs up &amp; down slightly from the ripples Ambrose creates.*\n\n“Look. I’m somebody’s daughter. A sister. A friend. We can work SOMETHING out Ambrose.”\n\n*Ambrose finally looks at Jules &amp; once again brandishes the pocketknife, which Jules eyes in terror. Ambrose puts the knife to his throat.*\n\n“Wait, what are you doing?! You’re just going to leave me to die alone down here?!”\n\n“Oh worry not Dear; you won’t be alone for long!”\n\nWith that, Ambrose drags the blade across his throat, the blood gushing out as he smiles at Jules who watches in horror. Ambrose collapses back into the water. The reservoir of the fountain fills up with a now crimson mix of water &amp; blood, as the spouts in the fountain suddenly spurt red streams into the pool.\n\nJules looks around the basement. Her head still aches.\n\nIt’s eerily silent now that the fountain has stopped. She puts her feet up to the metal shelving near where her hands are tied &amp; pushes with her feet as hard as she can while pulling her hands towards her. She feels a burning pain around her wrists, but the three zip ties don’t budge. They’re far too tight to slip her hands out of them, try as she might. She chews on them as hard as she can but it’s pointless, she’ll be down here for days like this. Jules looks at her trouser pockets, no phone. She left it upstairs on the desk in the library. She leans back against the wall behind her. She feels something in her back trouser pocket. She awkwardly maneuvers her hands to the back of her trousers. She can’t reach into the pockets, but she slowly pushes the shape up towards the pocket opening. Slowly…almost there.\n\n*\\*Clunk, clank\\**\n\nIt’s out. She now shimmies her rear forwards &amp; looks over her shoulder. Greg’s lighter! Jules gasps in relief. She manages to stretch her leg back &amp; put her toes behind the lighter &amp; nudges it gently towards her hands. Once it’s closer to her hands, she can now reach down with her face &amp; lift the lighter with her mouth, bringing it to her hands. She grabs the lighter with her fingers &amp; ignites it, holding the flame to the zip ties. One at a time they burn &amp; melt, finally freeing her wrists. She breathes a sigh of relief before pulling herself up with the metal shelfing. \n\nShe walks to Greg’s phone, all the while her eyes fixated on Ambrose’s lifeless corpse floating in the water. She grabs Greg’s phone. *“SHIT!” Jules* yelled*.* She doesn’t know the passcode. Jules holds down the side button &amp; volume button in an attempt to activate an emergency SOS call only to discover there’s no signal to make the call. She pulls down on the screen &amp; hits the flashlight button to turn it on. Well at least I can use it for that, she thinks to herself. Jules turns around &amp; points the light towards the stairs. She gives a quick last glance to both the bodies of Greg &amp; Ambrose as she passes by, then hurries up the stairs. She twists &amp; pulls the doorknob. Nothing. Harder now. Nothing again. It’s locked. She turns to look back down the stairs &amp; swallows hard. She needs the keys. \n\n*“No hesitating” she thinks to herself “Quickly grab the keys, run back up &amp; get the hell out of here”.* \n\nJules descends the stairs, phone lighting the way. She slowly approaches the pool, staring at Ambrose who is in turn staring at the ceiling with glassy eyes, lifeless eyes.\n\n*“*He’s dead for Christ’s sake!” she curses, in an attempt to reassure herself. \n\nShe tries to reach for him, but he is too far in the pool. Jules places the phone with the light side up &amp; takes off her shoes. She’s left with no choice but to enter the water. \n\nAfter rolling up her trousers, she carefully steps into the cold water until it’s almost up to her knees. Jules might have felt how cold it was if it weren’t for the pure adrenaline pumping through her veins. \n\nShe reaches into his left pocket; nothing. She takes one more glance in his eyes then reaches for his right pocket &amp; pulls out the ring of keys. Grabbing them tightly she hastily exits the pool, puts her shoes back on, re-arms herself with the phone’s flashlight &amp; rushes back up the stairs. \n\nAs she reaches the door, she quicky picks the first key at random, inserts it into the keyhole &amp; tries to turn; no luck. Jules moves onto the next one, trying to mentally notate the appearance of the key she already tried. There were 10-12 keys on the ring of varying lengths, some shorter more modern, some longer brass skeletons keys. \n\nJules inserts the third key.\n\n*\\*splash\\**\n\nFear washes over. She crouches down to look at the pool, slowly lighting it with the phone’s light. She can make out the top of both the bodies, both in the same place &amp; position they were in. She again reverts her attention back to the basement door. Faster now, she fumbles with the keys &amp; attempts unlocking the door. \n\n“Ok, not this one. Ugh not this one either. Wait, did I already try this one? No. Oh, c’mon please work…” She pleads.\n\n*\\*Splash\\**\n\nLouder this time. Jules’s hair stands up on the back of her neck as her blood runs ice-cold. She again lowers herself to aim the light towards the pool. \n\nGreg now is standing on the bottom of the steps. Pale as snow, dripping water with red stained down his t-shirt from the bloody gash in his neck, staring at Jules with cloudy-grey eyes. Jules recoils in horror.\n\n*“…Greg?” she whispers. That’s not Greg...*\n\n‘Greg’ doesn’t reply but begins running up the steps towards Jules. Jules quickly try’s the next key. She finally hears the door unlock &amp; quickly pulls it open, exits the basement &amp; locks the door from the other side just as ‘Greg’ was reaching her. \n\n*\\*SLAM\\** \n\n‘Greg’ slams on the other side of the door. A pause.\n\nJules stares at the door for a moment. She hears ‘Greg’ sing the same song in the same old-fashioned cadence as Ambrose did earlier:\n\n*“My love must be a kind of blind love, I can't see anyone but you..”*\n\nJules snaps out of it. She races to the front door. \n\n*\\*SLAM\\* -* she hears ‘Greg’ pounding on the basement door behind her.\n\nThe front door is padlocked with a small keyhole. None of the keys on the keyring match, they’re all far too large. Panic-stricken, she runs to the dining room window &amp; draws the curtains. The shutters are closed from the outside, the window itself is nailed shut. She lifts one of the chairs &amp; smashes the window with one hard hit. She then pushes on the shutters; locked, from the outside.\n\n*\\*SLAM\\** \\- Jules hears the basement door slam open. \n\nShe removes her sweater &amp; uses it to grab a sharp shard of glass from the windowpane and places the keys in her pocket. ‘Greg’ enters the dining room. \n\n“GET BACK! I’M FUCKING WARNING YOU!” Jules yells while pointing the glass shard towards ‘Greg’.\n\n‘Greg’ slowly advances towards her as Jules backs up towards the opposite end of the dining room table. Jules moves towards the left of the table, &amp; ‘Greg’ quickly does the same. Jules moves back to the right; ‘Greg’ copies her. A game of cat &amp; mouse. Jules moves further to the right only for ‘Greg’ to switch &amp; sprint down the right side towards her. Jules then runs for the dining room entrance, pulling the chairs behind her as she does so. The chairs slow ‘Greg’ down, but only slightly. Jules reaches the foyer with ‘Greg’ close in pursuit. She throws the coat rack down, tripping ‘Greg’ who trips over it &amp; falls to the floor, earning her precious seconds. \n\nShe needs to get her phone. She races up the stairs to the office, hearing a loud angry groan behind her. She reaches the door; locked. She fumbles with the keys, inserts one &amp; attempts to unlock to no avail. ‘Greg’ is almost at the top of the stairs; she doesn’t haven’t time.\n\n“Greg! Stop! Please!” she screams.\n\nJules runs to the next door in the corridor; locked. She races to the last door. It’s also locked. \n\nJules despairs. This is it. \n\nShe quickly looks at the doorknob &amp; keys. One of the skeleton keys had a unique art-deco style bow which matched the decal on the door handles plate. She inserts the matching key &amp; unlocks the door, then slams it behind her and locks the door.\n\nSilence now.  \n There’s no time to stall. She turns and runs towards the moonlight coming from a lone window on the far side of the dark room. There are no shutters, &amp; it’s not nailed shut. She puts the glass shard down on the mantle, then lifts with all her might. It may not be locked but it is extremely stiff &amp; heavy, she only manages to open it an inch. \n\nHer attention is so focused on escape she doesn’t notice movement in the dark behind her. \n\nIn the queen-sized bed, a figure slowly begins to sit up. There’s the initial appearance of a slim old woman, bald except for thin grey strands of hair around the sides. All around the eyes area are pitch black, impossible to make out the actual eyes, her jaw is massive and open, appearing unhinged in a perpetual voiceless scream. Her skin was decayed and looked almost charred. Her movement is calculated yet inhuman, hunching over, she rises on the bed; her mass leaving from under the duvet as she continues to tower to an unnatural height.\n\nJules grunts as she struggles to open the window open just another inch. She stops. She can sense the presence behind her now. She slowly turns her head to see the figure behind her, eyelevel at first but then looks up at the monstrosity before her. Jules lets out a horrified scream as the creature drops on top of her. \n\nA record spins on the record player downstairs:\n\n*My love must be a kind of blind love,*  \n *I can't see anyone but you.*\n\n*Are the stars out tonight?*  \n *I don't know if it's cloudy or bright.*  \n *I only have eyes for you dear.*\n\nWe hear Jules’s terrified screams and loud commotion from the bedroom; Fast footsteps, banging, clamoring. Glass smashing, followed by guttural growling. Jules shrieks in agony. Finally, two thuds, then silence.\n\n‘Greg’ makes his way back up the stairs. He knocks three times on the door. The door is unlocked from the inside and creaks open. ‘Greg’ enters the room for a moment then comes out dragging Jules by the underarms, leaving a trail of blood following. When he reaches the stairs he drops her completely, then lifts and puts her over his shoulder to continue down to the basement. He throws Jules in the water with a loud splash. ‘Greg’ returns to the bedroom and helps Perenna downstairs to the basement. He places her down gently in the water. Every single breath she takes is heavily labored. She has a large gash in her cheek, inflicted from Jules. Ambrose kisses her forehead and then slits her throat. Perenna releases one last breath, as red streams once again jet from the fountain.\n\nLater, in a room that was previously locked, the formerly known Greg &amp; Jules, now Ambrose and Perenna, are dancing hand in hand, spinning in each other’s arms. Perenna’s body, formerly Jules, is soaked. Her head is bloody, with blood covering the right side of her face. Her neck appears to be broken, yet she has a smile plastered on her face, gazing into her suitors’ eyes which is happily returned.\n\nThey both continue to dance &amp; the record continues to play:\n\n*You are here,*  \n *And so am I.*\n\n*Maybe millions of people go by,*  \n *But they all disappear from view,*  \n *And I only have eyes for you.*\n\n**The End.**",

        "text": "The Host.\r\n\r\nChapter 1: House Call.\r\n\r\nThe story starts at Tech-Help, a small computer &amp; electronics store in downtown Toronto. Pedestrians pass by on the busy street outside. The walls inside are lined with phone &amp; computer cases with arrays of different chargers &amp; tech accessories. There are 2 desks in the middle of the store displaying different brands of computers, both desktop &amp; portable. Greg is alone in the store, standing behind the counter. \r\nThe phone rings.\r\n\r\n“Thank you for contacting Tech-Help, my name is Greg, how may I help?”\r\n“Hello there, my name is Ambrose, how are you doing today?”\r\n“I’m fine thanks &amp; how can I help?”\r\n“I am looking to purchase a computer first and foremost. I’m also having issues with my home internet &amp; original computer.”\r\n“Ok &amp; what kind of computer are you looking for? &amp; what exactly are the issues you’re experiencing with your internet &amp; computer?”\r\n“Well, I believe the one I have is an Apple machine so I would most likely go for their latest, uh, evolution I suppose. As for the internet connection, oh it’s very spotty indeed. Quite aggravating. As for the old computer will just cut off randomly.”\r\n“Have you tried turning the router off &amp; on again?”\r\n“Yes, I can’t unplug it though, I can’t reach behind anymore to do it. Sometimes it makes bizarre noises, a kind of..zap, or buzz perhaps? Forgive my ignorance. I have a hard time explaining these things. I’m an old man, as you can probably tell. Can I perhaps book a home visit please? I will need help to set the new computer up, but also get the old one up &amp; running. At least long enough to take the content out of it &amp; into the new one that is.”\r\n“We may be able to do home visit yes, let me see what we have available. What days’ work for you?”\r\n“Oh any. I am retired.”\r\n“Ok great. I have availabilities on Friday. May I have your address please?”\r\n“It’s a little off the beaten path, I live in Brighton, Ontario, my postal code is- “\r\n“Oh I’m sorry sir, that’s too far. We only offer services for the city of Toronto. Is it possible for you to call into the store with the old computer so we can take a look at it? We can have the new one ready for pickup too?”\r\n“I’m afraid that’s not possible, our car no longer starts. That is disappointing. Out of curiosity, what are your rates of service?”\r\n“It’s $120 an hour, but again just for the city of Toronto.”\r\n“Well, I’m in quite a bit of distress over my electronics. I have no children, &amp; my Wife is bedridden. I was hoping to perhaps use these computers for doctor visits for her, hence the urgency.”\r\n“I’m very sorry to hear th- “\r\n“I can pay you both handsomely.”\r\n“Both?”\r\n“You guys normally operate in pairs, correct?”\r\n“Yes, we do have a buddy system for safety reasons”\r\n“Quite wise. $600 each. Truthfully, there aren’t many issues I need help with bar the ones I mentioned. I’ll even throw in travel expenses &amp; supper, for good measure.”\r\n“That is very generous of you sir, but it is against company policy to venture outside the city. I hope you understand.”\r\n“Well, that is a shame. Still, I do hope you have a nice evening”\r\n“You too, thank you for your call.”\r\n\r\nThe call ends. Greg’s eyes fixate on Ambrose’s number on the phones call log as he fiddles with his pen. Later, while Greg is on lunch break, he goes to a nearby café to buy a bagel &amp; coffee. His card gets declined. Greg bluffs it off to the Cashier as a chip issue that happens often. He steps out of the queue &amp; checks his balance. All of $2.37 in his account. \r\nHe goes back to the stockroom to sit down, eating a bag of chips he managed to buy with loose change. While sitting down &amp; eating his chips, he checks his voicemail:\r\n“Hi Greg, it’s Chris again, I am still waiting on the rent from both November &amp; December, please get back to me as soon as possible.”\r\n\r\nGreg gets back to the store, unlocks the door &amp; flips the sign on the door from CLOSED to OPEN. Enter Julie, AKA Jules.\r\n“I am so fuckin’ late. Is Tony in today?” Jules asks, slightly out of breath.\r\n“No you’re good.”\r\n“Well he’ll see I was late on my timecard eventually but screw it. I don’t get paid enough anyway.”\r\n“I hear ya.”\r\n“I’ll clock in now &amp; then you can go on your break”\r\n“It’s fine I already took a 15, I’m done soon anyway.”\r\n“Oh… sorry about that!”\r\n“It’s ok, it happens. You know Tony’s changing the commission policy where any more than 10% absenteeism disqualifies you for getting commission?”\r\n“YOU’RE KIDDING?!” Jules replies in surprise. “Welp, there goes my bonus for the month then. I was right on track too. Not like I have mouths to feed or anything.”\r\n“You don’t have kids?”\r\n“No but I have cats. Insatiable, needy cats with vet bills.”\r\n\r\nJules walks out of frame to the back of the store; Greg looks back to the landline phone. He goes back to Ambrose’s number, then jots down the number on his notepad. He removes the note, folds it &amp; puts it in his pocket. Later that evening on the subway on his ride home, Greg looks at the number on the note &amp; types it into his phone.\r\n\r\nAs Greg gets home that night, opening ramen in the kitchen he dials the number:\r\nGre “Hi there, is this Ambrose? Hi yes this is Greg from Tech-Help how are you? I’m well thanks, I’m just calling back as we may be able to make an exception…”\r\n\r\nIt’s 2 days later. Greg opens the door to Jules’s car:\r\n\r\n“I brought snacks!” Greg says, holding up a \r\n“Sweet, did you get coffee?”\r\n“Ah shit no, I completely forgot, lemme go back inside, I’ll be 10 mi- “\r\n“It’s fine, let’s just get going. I don’t want to lose any daylight. We can probably get something on the way.”\r\n“Ok sounds good.”\r\nGreg gets in the car &amp; puts on his seatbelt. Jules starts driving.\r\n“Sorry about the cat hair.”\r\n“All good.”\r\n“Wake n’ bake?” Greg asks, holding up a small joint.\r\n“Sure.”\r\n“You got a light?”\r\n“Yeah here:” \r\nJules takes a red lighter out of her pocket &amp; hands it to Greg.\r\n“This is my lighter.”\r\n“Is it? My bad.”\r\nGreg takes a few pulls of the joint, then passes it to Jules .\r\n“So you know where we’re going right?”\r\n“Yep, I mapped it out last night. I’ll be your Satnav.”\r\n“Ok great coz I haven’t got a clue. I got to admit this makes me a little nervous.”\r\n“Oh he sounded like he was ancient” Greg assures her. “Nothing to worry about.”\r\n“No not that, the fact that if we get found out we get fired.”\r\n“That’s why it’s only gonna be the once. It’s serious money. I called him again to arrange it. He purchased the computer over the phone &amp; as far as Tony knows the customer picked it up when he wasn’t on shift.”\r\n“Alright, one &amp; done. Wait this is gone out, pass me the light.”\r\n“The store has been crazy quiet lately, I think we need this anyway.” Greg hands her the lighter.\r\n“So what computer did he purchase?”\r\n“That’s the thing; he bought the latest iMac model but completely souped out with maximum RAM and two terabytes storage. $2600!”\r\n“Holy shit, we did need this.”\r\n“Right?! We’re gonna make bank today. So, what are we feeling music-wise? Passenger is always the satnav/DJ, pass me the auxiliary.”\r\n“Oh I don’t have one…”\r\n“Radio it is then!”\r\n\r\nGreg turns the radio on as they continue driving to their destination.\r\n \r\n\r\n\rChapter 2: Arrival.\r\n\r\n(Much later in the afternoon)\r\n“I know you said it was in the sticks &amp; all but I haven’t seen any signs of civilisation the past hour.”\r\n “I know, we’re almost there, it’s just a little furt- there! There’s the mailbox! He said we turn left at the bronze mailbox with the birds on it, up the driveway &amp; we’re there!”\r\n“Finally!” Jules sighed a sigh of relief. \r\n\r\nThey continued up the large tree-lined driveway until the house loomed in front of them. It was quite a marvel in comparison to its surroundings, completely tucked away from the world behind a fortress of trees, it was a weathered yet beautiful 2 story Victorian house. What wasn’t covered in dead ivy revealed chipped paint, yet it had maintained its impressive woodwork. There were little-to-no signs that anyone was actually living there. They park just in front of the porch. Greg opens the back car door; reaches in &amp; hands Jules a bag pack &amp; lifts out a large computer box. They both step up on the porch &amp; reach the door which boasted a beautiful stained-glass window, all the while the wood creaking under them. Greg knocks. Silence. \r\n\r\n”We’re not early our we?” Jules asks.\r\n“Nah it’s 2.30… I think I hear someone coming anyway.”\r\n\r\nThey hear the click &amp; clacks of locks being unlocked behind the door. Both Jules &amp; Greg give their best, warm, Customer smiles as the door opens. Standing before them is Ambrose. He is about 6’1”, slim, bald on the top with white whisps around the sides &amp; back. He is wearing a navy wool sweater with the collar of a white shirt underneath, black slacks &amp; plain black shoes. His face was sunken &amp; skeletal, pale except for dark skin around his piercing eyes. He smiled at them both revealing grey &amp; yellowed teeth.\r\nAmbrose: “Hello! Oh how wonderful you both came” He spoke in a slightly raspy tone with an unusual, unidentifiable accent.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon entering they were hit with a slight, stale smell in the cold air. The landing was stereotypical of an older, upper/middle-class North American home, boasting original handcrafted woodwork with a mirror &amp; side table to the right with an old coat stand. A staircase to the left leading to the upper floor, while down past it was a narrow corridor leading to what was most likely the kitchen. There was a sitting room to the left which looked as though it had been plucked right out of a 50’s interior decorating magazine &amp; hadn’t been touched since. \r\n\r\n“Would you like me to take your coats?” Ambrose asks politely. “Is that box heavy?”\r\n“That’s ok!”\r\n“Yeah I’ll keep my coat on too if that’s alright.” Greg agrees.\r\n“Ah, the cold. My apologies, I never have visitors &amp; I’m rather used to it. Oh what kind of host am I?!\r\n“That’s no problem at all sir” Greg assures Ambrose while rubbing his hands together “So as discussed on the phone with you this is Jules who will be working with me.”\r\n“Nice to meet you!” Jules declares with a warm smile.\r\n“Hope you found your way here alright. I know it’s rather secluded.”\r\n“Not a problem! So you mentioned there’s a computer in the library?”\r\n“Straight to business I see!” Ambrose chuckles. “Yes, upstairs in the library. Follow me. Oh, I do appreciate the exception you made to your rules to help an old man &amp; his wife out.”\r\n“I really love your home Ambrose” Jules says, admiring her surroundings. “May I ask how old it is?”\r\n“Oh this house has been in our family since 1840.”\r\n“That’s pretty amazing!”\r\n“Yes, well the renovations have certainly been costly. Luckily, I am comfortable so it’s been well worth it.”\r\n\r\nAs they ascend the stairs, they both gaze at the old black &amp; white photographs lining the walls &amp; newspaper clippings that appeared to be as old as newspapers have been around. Ambrose is lightly singing a melody, both Greg &amp; Jules recognise it as I Only Have Eyes For You. As they reach the top of the stairs, they see paintings of different eras lining the walls, some appearing to be as recent as the 20th century but some reminiscent in style of art from the Renaissance period. One in particular grabs their attention:\r\n\r\n“Oh what an amazing painting that is!” Gasps Jules.\r\n\r\nA portrait painting of a middle-aged man &amp; woman, donned in black clothes lined with pearls &amp; emeralds &amp; both wore large white, ruffled collars &amp; appeared to be of noble class.\r\n\r\n“It really is impressive. Can I ask who this painting is of?”\r\n“Those are my ancestors. Great, great Grandparents. This was painted in London, England in the 1600’s, they were a Lord &amp; Lady.”\r\nNeither one of the pair in the painting seemed to have any resemblance at all to Ambrose, with no similar facial features. The man was large &amp; frumpy in contrast to Han’s slender frame, while the woman also had a fuller face &amp; ginger hair. \r\n\r\n“If you like antiques I have an entire house full of them. Die Bibliothek ist gleich hier durch.”\r\n“Sorry?” Greg asks in confusion.\r\n“The library is just through here!” Ambrose corrects himself.\r\n\r\nAmbrose takes out a ring of keys &amp; unlocks the door to the library. The back wall is lined with old books with an old mahogany desk in the centre, &amp; a large late 90’s/early 2000’s desktop computer. Ambrose attempts to give them both a rundown of what he thinks may be wrong with the machine, albeit from a clearly ignorant point of view. Greg &amp; Jules make little effort to listen to his words as their attention has been stolen by their dust-covered surroundings, donned with curious antiques &amp; objects that are clearly not from this century. A brown, old world globe bar in the corner, a very large gold mirror on the left wall next to a grandfather clock, an ancient looking bronze helmet seemingly of Nordic origin, an Aztec-appearing green statue of what looked like a ferocious priestess wearing a headdress &amp; holding a sheath. Extraordinary medieval tapestries hung on the walls protected behind glass frames, depicting anything from wars to harvests to worship.\r\n\r\n“Here it is.”\r\nJules &amp; Greg make their way to the computer. Greg puts the box down on the desk while Jules takes off her bag pack &amp; sits in the office chair. \r\n“Ok so it is technically connected to the internet, but it doesn’t seem to be working. Ambrose where is the router?”\r\n“It’s down in the basement. I can show you?”\r\n“Sure let’s go”\r\n“For the sake of efficiency, why don’t I go down &amp; checkout the router situation &amp; make sure it’s all in working order, maybe it just needs to be moved up a floor. You can set up the new computer up here &amp; maybe troubleshoot the old one to see if it’s on the computers end that the connections not working, if you’d like?”\r\n“Works for me, I brought a repeater also, so I’ll set that up here too. If I need anything I’ll text yo-“ Jules looks at her phone &amp; realises there are 0 bars of service. \r\n“Know what? Scratch that, I have no service. Makes sense being all the way out here. Ambrose, do you know the WIFI password?”\r\n“I’m afraid I don’t. Can I get you guys’ tea or coffee?”\r\n“It’s probably on the router, I’ll take a pic &amp; bring it up. I’d love a coffee please Ambrose.”\r\n“Me too!”\r\n“Very well then.”\r\n\r\nGreg walks out of the office while Ambrose holds the door open for him. As Ambrose closes the door behind them, he stares at Jules who is now too focused on unpacking the computer to notice him. \r\n\r\n\n\r\nChapter 3: The Web\r\n\r\nAmbrose opens the door to the basement &amp; pulls on the chain for the lightbulb, illuminating the staircase.\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to forgive me, it’s the least flattering room of the house. If you want to mosey on down, I will get the coffees.”\r\nJust as Greg reaches the bottom of the stairs, Ambrose calls for him:\r\n“Oh &amp; Greg!”\r\nGreg turns back around &amp; looks up the stairs at Ambrose.\r\n“Milk &amp; sugar?”\r\n“Yes double-double for both of us.”\r\n“…Pardon?” Ambrose says confused.\r\n“Uh, I take 2 milk 2 sugar, as does…Jules.”\r\n\r\nThe lightbulb is above &amp; behind Ambrose, making him a mostly black figure now. His eyes however, looked as though they had a strange glint to them that Greg hadn’t noticed before. Greg could also make out the outline of a grin that was less friendly &amp; more menacing. Greg realises he hasn’t seen Ambrose blink the entire time they’ve been there. Ambrose stares for another second that felt like a minute, then left the basement without another word. The whole interaction made Greg uneasy. He examines his dimly-lit surroundings &amp; notices a slight green light coming from the far wall. He turns the flashlight on his phone, further illuminating the basement as he walks forward, his face narrowly avoiding a spider in its web, rolling its trappings up in its silk.\r\n“Gross” Greg remarks in disgust.\r\nIt was certainly the oldest appearing area of the house that Greg had seen. It was a large basement with wood flooring, tools hung on the left wall below a very small rectangular window that give practically no light, metal shelves lining the right wall donned with miscellaneous jars &amp; boxes. Oddly, there was an old stone water fountain fixed to the front wall, while there were white sheets covering furniture scattered around. Several masks hung from rope from the ceiling, some appearing of Amazonian origin while others Venetian, but all share the same quality of appearing to be several century’s old. Everything was covered in cobwebs &amp; dust, while there was a damp smell in the cold air. To the right of the front wall was the green light emanating from the router. \r\nGreg makes his way to the router &amp; hits the power button, waits a couple seconds, then turns it back on. After rolling his sleeves up, he uses his hand to trace the dusty power cable to the back of the nightstand. Greg lightly sighs. He’s going to have to move the mahogany nightstand. Greg puts the phone down by a leg of the metal shelfing, upright to light the task at hand. Greg lifts &amp; pulls it towards himself, slowly. He can feel items moving around inside, but he knows better than to open doors in a private residence where he is working. He grunts as he again lifts &amp; pulls it further out from the wall.\r\n \r\n“How are you faring?”\r\n“Christ!” Greg almost jumps out of his skin. \r\nHe turns to face Ambrose, standing with a vintage silver tray holding two small cups of coffee.\r\n“I’m sorry, you frightened me, I didn’t even hear you come down.”\r\n“No Christ here I’m afraid!” Ambrose lightly chuckles. “Your coffee.”\r\n“Oh thank you.” Greg takes a cup, blows on it &amp; then takes a sip.\r\n“mm, that’s good.”\r\n“I’m glad it’s to your liking.”\r\nAmbrose stands staring at Greg for a minute, who’s discomfort is now palpable.\r\n“So…” Greg says, looking around him.\r\n“I’ll bring the cup back up to the kitchen if you’re finished. They’re my Wife’s beloved China.”\r\n“Oh…ok sure.” \r\nGreg finishes the coffee in the cup &amp; puts it back on the tray. \r\n“May I ask your background Gregory?”\r\n“It’s just Greg actually. I’m Irish &amp; moved to Canada about 7 years ago.”\r\n“You ever hear the phrase ‘The Luck of the Irish’? Well people today take it to mean the Irish people have good fortune, while the truth is the contrary. As I’m sure you’re aware, historically speaking the Irish have had terrible misfortune, &amp; the saying was meant to infer bad luck. Just another term lost to time.”\r\n“That’s interesting! Although I should get ba- “\r\n“Born in Ireland you said?”\r\n“Yes.”\r\n“Uncircumcised then?”\r\nGreg’s mouth drops &amp; eyebrows raise in surprise.\r\n“…I’m sorry” Greg states sternly “I’m not comfortable answering that.”  \r\n“Oh aha, I am sorry. You reach a certain age &amp; words just seem to fly out the mouth without consideration. I meant it as a positive though. Unnecessary mutilation, never understood it. No, it’s much better that you’re not.”\r\nGreg is offended at the topic of conversation &amp; debating if he should just go get Jules &amp; call it a day, but he didn’t want to drag her all the way out here for nothing. Besides, he needs the money. At least he’s not harassing Jules right now.\r\n“Oh that is a pity.” Ambrose says, eyeing Greg’s forearms.\r\n“I’m sorry?”\r\n“Your…tattoos, I believe they’re called. What a pity you ruined the skin like that.”\r\nGreg is taken aback once again by Ambrose’s comment.\r\n“Well I like them.” Greg says sharply. “If you don’t mind Sir, I need to focus on the job at hand now. Thank you for the coffee.” Greg turns his back to Ambrose.\r\n“A potato peeler.”\r\n“…Excuse me?” Greg rolls his eyes and looks back again at Ambrose, clear irritation in his voice now.\r\n“A potato peeler would do the trick. Peel the top layers of the skin off until there’s no more visible markings. I first thought of a cheese grater but that would be rather messy &amp; cumbersome, ha! No, a potato peeler would do nicely. Certainly, it would leave nasty scars, but I do believe that would still be preferable than those unsightly markings.”\r\n\r\nGreg leans back on the nightstand. He’s become lightheaded, nauseous, &amp; his vision is blurry. He focuses as much on the basement stairs as much as possible &amp; weakly tries to push Ambrose out of the way, but Ambrose simply takes a step back &amp; avoids him. \r\nGreg staggers towards the stairs for 2 or 3 more steps until his legs give out below him. He crawls towards the stairs, trying to shout for Jules but only managing to grunt her name. As his hands grab the second step, he feels his face become covered &amp; head yanked backwards, a zip tie closes around his neck. He is being smothered. He tries to pull &amp; frantically rip at the face-covering, but his arms are weak, &amp; he is extremely disorientated. He feels Ambrose’s hand on the back of his head, &amp; suddenly his head is quickly &amp; forcefully forced towards the step–\r\nTHUD…THUD. \r\nGreg’s head is repeatedly slammed off the step. Greg falls to the side, silent for a moment - until a light cough is heard beneath the plastic.\r\n“You are a persistent one!” Ambrose remarks frustratedly. \r\nHe reaches in his pocket &amp; reveals a pocketknife. He pulls Greg’s head far back once again &amp; slowly slices Greg’s throat open. Blood pools on the floor as Greg gurgles blood &amp; twitches. Ambrose cleans off the blade with a handkerchief from his pocket &amp; closes the pocketknife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJules hears a knock at the library door followed quickly by Ambrose entering.\r\n\r\nPardon me, don’t mean to disturb you working. Here is your coffee.”\r\n“Oh thank you!”\r\nAs Ambrose walks his way to the desk, under his breath he is singing the same song from earlier. Jules takes the cup of coffee from him. \r\n“Is Greg still down there? The connection still isn’t working…”\r\n“He wanted me to tell you he is moving the router up a floor to the living room; he’ll be just another minute.”\r\n“Uhm, ok, well I have the new computer up &amp; ready, the old one is ready to transfer the data too. Repeater is good to go; all we need now is an actual internet connection to start the migration… Why don’t I go down &amp; hel- “\r\n“May I ask you a few questions about this machine?”\r\n“Sure.”\r\nAmbrose proceeds to ask questions about how it all function &amp; how it compares to the former &amp; the very basics such as browsing the web, which Jules patiently answers, while taking swigs from her cup. \r\nAmbrose turns his gaze from the computer screen to Jules .\r\n“You have truly magnificent skin Jules . Soft, supple, fresh. Paired with blue eyes; how lovely!”\r\n“Thank you. Is that a picture of you &amp; your Wife?” Jules nods towards a picture frame on the desk in an attempt to not only change the subject away from her, but to remind Ambrose of his marriage.\r\n“Ita quod nos.”\r\n“I’m sorry?”\r\n“Ah yes, that’s my Wife Perenna and I.”\r\nIn the black-and-white picture is a much younger looking Ambrose with a full head of hair wearing a sharp suit. Locking his arm was a beautiful woman who appeared to be of similar age. Both are standing outside the same house they are currently in, although the house looks much more newly built.\r\n\r\n“Beautiful couple.”\r\n“Thank you. I would introduce both of you, but she is currently very ill.”\r\n“I’m sorry to hear that, Ambrose.” Jules says, with genuine empathy.\r\n“That’s quite alright. She won’t be suffering for much longer.”\r\nJules looks down &amp; frowns as her eyes droop.\r\n“I’m not feeling great…”\r\n\r\nAmbrose walks back to his armchair with the picture frame &amp; sits down, putting the picture on a side table next to him to admire it.\r\n\r\n“Both of us have been together so long it’s all we know now. At the beginning, oh what a privilege it is! You travel the corners of the world, learning new languages, poetry, music. But when there's nothing left to be curious for, all that's left is apathy; when every sight &amp; sound, pain &amp; pleasure has become overly familiar. What does one do when your once insatiable thirst for knowledge has been quenched? \r\nI've seen the very depths of humanity's kindness, but more so it's cruelty. It's all laughably predictable. It's why we're hidden away here, but we could never be far enough. What a dream it would be to live together all the way on the moon &amp; just watch as everyone tears each other apart in their cycle of never-ending depravity. No. Nothing ever really changes. \r\nThese trinkets &amp; tchotchkes may possess monetary or historical value, but the only value they bear to me is the memories they have attached. Taking me back to when I still had a lust for life. \r\nIf it wasn't for Perenna, I would not be here now. To have someone to share all of it with, that is the TRUE privilege. To be able to share this blessing &amp; curse of life with one another. Impervious to all except an aging shell, you see. She's the only constant. The only reliable. Numb from the banality of existence &amp; repetitiveness of the world yet when I look at her, I still feel something. I still feel love, excitement, purpose. That is why I am utterly devoted to her. That is why I keep going. As long as I still have breath in my body. Time may mean nothing to me anymore, but she still means everything.”\r\n\r\nJules has now passed out at the desk.\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\nChapter 4: Transfiguration.\r\n\r\nJules’s eyes open. Her vision is blurry as she tries to focus on a black shape who appears to be cranking a mechanical device. Her head severely aches, she tries to rub the back of her head, but her hands won’t lift. She looks down at her hands. They’re tied with zip ties to a leg of the metal shelfing. She panics &amp; pulls; the leg doesn’t move. It suddenly comes back to her what she was doing right before she passed out. She looks down to see a body to her left, the head wrapped in blood-soaked plastic.\r\n“GREG?!Oh no, no nooo… WHY?!” Jules cries.\r\n“Regretfully matters had gotten rougher than anticipated. I have procrastinated once again &amp; left it too long, hence the urgency. It’s such an unpleasant process every time.”\r\nAmbrose is turning a crank in the wall that is opening a section of the floor, not unlike a trapdoor. As he continues to turn the handle, Jules can make out what looks like water. It now appeared that the stone fountain was actually a part of some bigger aquatic function, something below the floorboards.\r\n“…What process?”\r\n“Not for you to be concerned about.” Ambrose says without turning around.\r\nAmbrose bends down &amp; cuts off the zip tie around Greg’s neck with his pocketknife. He removes the now-red plastic off Greg’s heads. Jules looks in Greg’s dead eyes &amp; whimpers. Ambrose proceeds to pull Greg by the legs towards the opening in the floor. He then unbuttons Greg’s shirt to reveal a white shirt, with blood down the chest of it from the gash in his neck. He then removes Greg’s shoes &amp; rolls him into the opening with a splash.\r\n“Look, whatever happened here, it’s done. We can see about working something out here Ambrose. Please, Ambrose? If you let me go it will fare much better for you in the long run than you killing both Greg &amp; I. We have a job &amp; families that will be looking for us, &amp; they will find us. \r\nIf they find you murdered Greg &amp; me, you will go to prison &amp; you will never see the light of day – or your Wife – ever again. But if you let me go, maybe there’s a chance for leniency? Maybe you can see your Wife on visitation? I will vouch for you &amp; say you were gentle with me, that you were overcome with grief when you realised what you’d done. You can say you blacked out &amp; don’t even remember killing him!”\r\nAmbrose opens the door to the mahogany nightstand to reveal a safe. He takes keys from his pocket &amp; opens the door. He then takes out something wrapped in white cloth. Ambrose unwraps the cloth to reveal an old rock with a strange sigil engraved, visually similar to a rune.\r\n“Does your Wife know what you’re doing Ambrose? HEY!” She shouts, angry now.\r\nAmbrose ignores her. He rolls up his pants, slowly lowers himself to the edge &amp; then enters the water. The water is shallow, not even up to his knees. After rolling up his sleeves, Ambrose seems to feel the bottom of the pool with an empty hand. Then, with the hand holding the rock, he puts the rock underwater &amp; then stands up straight again, as Greg’s corpse bobs up &amp; down slightly from the ripples Ambrose creates.\r\n“Look. I’m somebody’s daughter. A sister. A friend. We can work SOMETHING out Ambrose.”\r\nAmbrose finally looks at Jules &amp; once again brandishes the pocketknife, which Jules eyes in terror. Ambrose puts the knife to his throat.\r\n“Wait, what are you doing?! You’re just going to leave me to die alone down here?!”\r\n\r\n“Oh worry not Dear; you won’t be alone for long!”\r\n\r\nWith that, Ambrose drags the blade across his throat, the blood gushing out as he smiles at Jules who watches in horror. Ambrose collapses back into the water. The reservoir of the fountain fills up with a now crimson mix of water &amp; blood, as the spouts in the fountain suddenly spurt red streams into the pool.\r\nJules looks around the basement. Her head still aches.\r\nIt’s eerily silent now that the fountain has stopped. She puts her feet up to the metal shelving near where her hands are tied &amp; pushes with her feet as hard as she can while pulling her hands towards her. She feels a burning pain around her wrists, but the three zip ties don’t budge. They’re far too tight to slip her hands out of them, try as she might. She chews on them as hard as she can but it’s pointless, she’ll be down here for days like this. Jules looks at her trouser pockets, no phone. She left it upstairs on the desk in the library. She leans back against the wall behind her. She feels something in her back trouser pocket. She awkwardly maneuvers her hands to the back of her trousers. She can’t reach into the pockets, but she slowly pushes the shape up towards the pocket opening. Slowly…almost there.\n\r\n*Clunk, clank*\n\r\nIt’s out. She now shimmies her rear forwards &amp; looks over her shoulder. Greg’s lighter! Jules gasps in relief. She manages to stretch her leg back &amp; put her toes behind the lighter &amp; nudges it gently towards her hands. Once it’s closer to her hands, she can now reach down with her face &amp; lift the lighter with her mouth, bringing it to her hands. \nShe grabs the lighter with her fingers &amp; ignites it, holding the flame to the zip ties. One at a time they burn &amp; melt, finally freeing her wrists. She breathes a sigh of relief before pulling herself up with the metal shelfing. She walks to Greg’s phone, all the while her eyes fixated on Ambrose’s lifeless corpse floating in the water. She grabs Greg’s phone. “SHIT!” Jules yelled. She doesn’t know the passcode. Jules holds down the side button &amp; volume button in an attempt to activate an emergency SOS call only to discover there’s no signal to make the call. She pulls down on the screen &amp; hits the flashlight button to turn it on. Well at least I can use it for that, she thinks to herself. Jules turns around &amp; points the light towards the stairs. \nShe gives a quick last glance to both the bodies of Greg &amp; Ambrose as she passes by, then hurries up the stairs. She twists &amp; pulls the doorknob. Nothing. Harder now. Nothing again. It’s locked. She turns to look back down the stairs &amp; swallows hard. She needs the keys. \r\n“No hesitating” she thinks to herself “Quickly grab the keys, run back up &amp; get the hell out of here”. \r\nJules descends the stairs, phone lighting the way. She slowly approaches the pool, staring at Ambrose who is in turn staring at the ceiling with glassy eyes, lifeless eyes.\r\n“He’s dead for Christ’s sake!” she curses, in an attempt to reassure herself. \r\nShe tries to reach for him, but he is too far in the pool. Jules places the phone with the light side up &amp; takes off her shoes. She’s left with no choice but to enter the water. \r\nAfter rolling up her trousers, she carefully steps into the cold water until it’s almost up to her knees. Jules might have felt how cold it was if it weren’t for the pure adrenaline pumping through her veins. \r\nShe reaches into his left pocket; nothing. She takes one more glance in his eyes then reaches for his right pocket &amp; pulls out the ring of keys. Grabbing them tightly she hastily exits the pool, puts her shoes back on, re-arms herself with the phone’s flashlight &amp; rushes back up the stairs. \r\nAs she reaches the door, she quicky picks the first key at random, inserts it into the keyhole &amp; tries to turn; no luck. Jules moves onto the next one, trying to mentally notate the appearance of the key she already tried. There were 10-12 keys on the ring of varying lengths, some shorter more modern, some longer brass skeletons keys. \r\nJules inserts the third key.\r\n*splash*\r\nFear washes over. She crouches down to look at the pool, slowly lighting it with the phone’s light. She can make out the top of both the bodies, both in the same place &amp; position they were in. She again reverts her attention back to the basement door. Faster now, she fumbles with the keys &amp; attempts unlocking the door. \r\n“Ok, not this one. Ugh not this one either. Wait, did I already try this one? No. Oh, c’mon please work…” She pleads.\r\n*Splash*\r\nLouder this time. Jules’s hair stands up on the back of her neck as her blood runs ice-cold. She again lowers herself to aim the light towards the pool. \r\nGreg now is standing on the bottom of the steps. Pale as snow, dripping water with red stained down his t-shirt from the bloody gash in his neck, staring at Jules with cloudy-grey eyes. Jules recoils in horror.\r\n“…Greg?” she whispers. That’s not Greg...\r\n‘Greg’ doesn’t reply but begins running up the steps towards Jules. Jules quickly try’s the next key. She finally hears the door unlock &amp; quickly pulls it open, exits the basement &amp; locks the door from the other side just as ‘Greg’ was reaching her. \r\n*SLAM* \r\n‘Greg’ slams on the other side of the door. A pause.\r\nJules stares at the door for a moment. She hears ‘Greg’ sing the same song in the same old-fashioned cadence as Ambrose did earlier:\r\n“My love must be a kind of blind love, I can't see anyone but you..”\r\nJules snaps out of it. She races to the front door. \r\n*SLAM* - she hears ‘Greg’ pounding on the basement door behind her.\n\r\nThe front door is padlocked with a small keyhole. None of the keys on the keyring match, they’re all far too large. Panic-stricken, she runs to the dining room window &amp; draws the curtains. The shutters are closed from the outside, the window itself is nailed shut. She lifts one of the chairs &amp; smashes the window with one hard hit. She then pushes on the shutters; locked, from the outside.\r\n\r\n*SLAM* - Jules hears the basement door slam open. \r\n\r\nShe removes her sweater &amp; uses it to grab a sharp shard of glass from the windowpane and places the keys in her pocket. ‘Greg’ enters the dining room. \r\n“GET BACK! I’M FUCKING WARNING YOU!” Jules yells while pointing the glass shard towards ‘Greg’.\r\n‘Greg’ slowly advances towards her as Jules backs up towards the opposite end of the dining room table. Jules moves towards the left of the table, &amp; ‘Greg’ quickly does the same. Jules moves back to the right; ‘Greg’ copies her. A game of cat &amp; mouse. Jules moves further to the right only for ‘Greg’ to switch &amp; sprint down the right side towards her. Jules then runs for the dining room entrance, pulling the chairs behind her as she does so. The chairs slow ‘Greg’ down, but only slightly. Jules reaches the foyer with ‘Greg’ close in pursuit. She throws the coat rack down, tripping ‘Greg’ who trips over it &amp; falls to the floor, earning her precious seconds. \r\nShe needs to get her phone. She races up the stairs to the office, hearing a loud angry groan behind her. She reaches the door; locked. She fumbles with the keys, inserts one &amp; attempts to unlock to no avail. ‘Greg’ is almost at the top of the stairs; she doesn’t haven’t time.\r\n“Greg! Stop! Please!” she screams.\r\nJules runs to the next door in the corridor; locked. She races to the last door. It’s also locked. \r\nJules despairs. This is it. \r\nShe quickly looks at the doorknob &amp; keys. One of the skeleton keys had a unique art-deco style bow which matched the decal on the door handles plate. She inserts the matching key &amp; unlocks the door, then slams it behind her and locks the door.\r\nSilence now.\r\nThere’s no time to stall. She turns and runs towards the moonlight coming from a lone window on the far side of the dark room. There are no shutters, &amp; it’s not nailed shut. She puts the glass shard down on the mantle, then lifts with all her might. It may not be locked but it is extremely stiff &amp; heavy, she only manages to open it an inch. \r\nHer attention is so focused on escape she doesn’t notice movement in the dark behind her. \r\nIn the queen-sized bed, a figure slowly begins to sit up. There’s the initial appearance of a slim old woman, bald except for thin grey strands of hair around the sides. All around the eyes area are pitch black, impossible to make out the actual eyes, her jaw is massive and open, appearing unhinged in a perpetual voiceless scream. Her skin was decayed and looked almost charred. Her movement is calculated yet inhuman, hunching over, she rises on the bed; her mass leaving from under the duvet as she continues to tower to an unnatural height.\r\nJules grunts as she struggles to open the window open just another inch. She stops. She can sense the presence behind her now. She slowly turns her head to see the figure behind her, eyelevel at first but then looks up at the monstrosity before her. Jules lets out a horrified scream as the creature drops on top of her. \r\nA record spins on the record player downstairs:\r\n\r\nMy love must be a kind of blind love,\r\nI can't see anyone but you.\r\nAre the stars out tonight?\r\nI don't know if it's cloudy or bright.\r\nI only have eyes for you dear.\r\n\r\nWe hear Jules’s terrified screams and loud commotion from the bedroom; Fast footsteps, banging, clamoring. Glass smashing, followed by guttural growling. Jules shrieks in agony. Finally, two thuds, then silence.\r\n\r\n‘Greg’ makes his way back up the stairs. He knocks three times on the door. The door is unlocked from the inside and creaks open. ‘Greg’ enters the room for a moment then comes out dragging Jules by the underarms, leaving a trail of blood following. When he reaches the stairs he drops her completely, then lifts and puts her over his shoulder to continue down to the basement. He throws Jules in the water with a loud splash. ‘Greg’ returns to the bedroom and helps Perenna downstairs to the basement. He places her down gently in the water. Every single breath she takes is heavily labored. She has a large gash in her cheek, inflicted from Jules. Ambrose kisses her forehead and then slits her throat. Perenna releases one last breath, as red streams once again jet from the fountain.\r\n\r\nLater, in a room that was previously locked, the formerly known Greg &amp; Jules, now Ambrose and Perenna, are dancing hand in hand, spinning in each other’s arms. Perenna’s body, formerly Jules, is soaked. Her head is bloody, with blood covering the right side of her face. Her neck appears to be broken, yet she has a smile plastered on her face, gazing into her suitors’ eyes which is happily returned.\r\n\r\nThey both continue to dance &amp; the record continues to play:\r\n\r\nYou are here,\r\nAnd so am I.\r\nMaybe millions of people go by,\r\nBut they all disappear from view,\r\nAnd I only have eyes for you.\r\r\n\r\n \r\nThe End.",

        "text": "**Preface** \n\nMy mom lived in Albuquerque in the 70s and 80s. Her fond stories of the southwest is actually why I decided to leave the Midwest and head out there for college. I'm about 700 miles away from home, yes as I write this, but that's never really been a problem. I didn't really get out much in high school, so a chance at freedom and independence? Yeah I took it as fast as I could. Don't get me wrong, I was still nervous for those first couple of days. But I was mostly excited for my life to finally start. My school is set in the wooded mountains of Norther New Mexico. And we have a pretty robust Outdoor Program, so much so that they offer an outdoor orientation program for incoming freshmen. Being from the midwest, and not really used to tasting any adventure, I wanted to go out and be in the great outdoors. Push myself.\n\nI remember waiting on the portal for 20 minutes waiting for the trip signup to open. I jumped on promptly and secured the first spot. \"My life *is* beginning!\" That was certain. The next couple of weeks I was preparing myself for the 10-day backpacking trip in the backcountry of the Pecos Wilderness, NM. Using far too much of my summer lifeguarding funds I sprung for the stylish purple hiking boots (that I still use). The trip was to take place before the rest of my classmates got to campus for the first time, and I was unable to move into my dorm for the year. So I flew to New Mexico, and my parents would drive out 12 days later. \n\n**Chapter 1 - First Appearances**\n\n\"Everyone is so quiet here, I really go to a book school huh\" I sat in a room with some 20 other kids. The name tagged admissions employees had herded all of us into a recreation room. We would all be going backpacking together. Unfortunately I have this terrible habit of being socially insufferable and loud when no one is talking. I used to hate silence, now it's gotten easier and I actually welcome it. But back then, whew, insecure and anxious. Heading back to my temporary room for the couple of days before the trip I was kicking myself. \"Why do you always do this? God, they must think you're a verbal klutz.\" Most likely no one was thinking about me, they probably were all concerned with how they presented to the group. But that's not how 18 year olds think. Showered and full I had a hard time going to sleep that night. I was sleeping soundly until around 2 am, when I groggily awoke. Kinda startled in the way when a conversation is cutoff. I looked around, I was just talking to someone, where did they go? In the corner of my room, there they were. Huddled and quiet. Just observing. I squinted my eyes, and could only make out the colors of yellow plaid and brown hair. I want to say that at this point in my life, I was pretty aloof to nightmare and sleep paralysis types. I've always loved the creepy things of life personal and impersonal to me, but I've never *really* believed in it. Anyways, nothing about that blob of color in the corner screamed danger to me. So I just kind of went back to sleep, uncaring. \n\nIn the morning I woke up positioned directly towards that corner. I rushed to put my glasses on, there was a hamper in that corner but no plaid. \"My eyes must've been playing a trick on me, I do have 20/400 vision\" (sometimes I get so mad that I have to wear glasses for the rest of my life, but my grievances with my eyes isn't why you're reading this). And hey, even though there wasn't anything colored yellow in the corner, I don't know much about optics at night. Either way, I ignored whatever the hell was in my room that night. \n\nThe next couple of days was boring, yet crucial, preparation for the trip. Learning to tie knots, how to throw a bear bag, how to clean your water, how to pack your site up. Important stuff we'd need to know. It all kind of flashed by quickly, until it was time to go. \n\nOur group of about 20 was divided roughly in half and we were sent to opposite ends of the trail. This was done to adhere to \"Leave No Trace.\" Smaller groups means less disruption on the trails. I was in the Irongate group. We drove about an hour and a half into the Pecos National Wilderness, and set up camp for the night. My kitchen group and myself made some really terrible food for dinner, but we topped it off with everyone's favorite card games. We would be embarking towards the trail in the morning. \n\nMy friend Eli and I were in the same trail group. Our group at Irongate was again divided in two, the first group left at 8 and the second left at 10. This again is to make sure we weren't disturbing the environment too much. (If you plan to go into the wilderness I'd suggest taking a look at the L.N.T principles, and the Park Service website! It's always best to be as informed as possible.) Eli and I being two of the only three girl students (there was one upperclassmen girl who was helping, Anne) on our section, all were in the same tent. So we packed up the site after our other member had left at 8. Eli was packing away the tarp and I had just put away stakes for the ends when I saw a back country 10 eating breakfast at a picnic bench. I hate to admit it, but I couldn't even really tell what his face looked like. He was kind of far away, and with my distracted brain and my shi$ eyes, it was hard for me to tell. But he had that rugged look that lets you know he could carry you if you couldn't walk. I was squinting trying to make out his face for so long that he noticed me and waved over at me. I turned red and quickened my pace. No way did I embarrass myself socially, in the middle of the gd woods. Could I ever escape myself? \n\nFor that first day, our hike was supposed to be an easy 3 mile hike. All we had to do was follow the trail. And we had a professional guide and a map, how hard could it be? The first quarter mile of the hike was up a beautiful wooded alpine hill. It was honestly like being in forks, Washington. I was already tired but the environment was absolutely beautiful and the fresh air was cleansing. \n\nEli and I were hanging out in the back so we could gossip about the rest of the group. Nothing malicious just discussing our first impressions. She was always really intuitive, I'd known her for a couple of years now. She was one of those friends that you're just kind of drawn to, something was always unspoken for us. We just kind of worked? Long story short, I trusted her, and in new situations it's always good to have someone you can trust. \n\nMy eyes were closed from laughing at something she had just told me when I bumped into the guy's pack ahead of me. \"Shit my bad.\" I looked up and noticed we had stopped, everyone began to gather around the group leaders. \"What's up,\" I asked. \"Oh we're just trying to figure which way to go.\" Our guide mumbled looking at the map. \"T..this way! Yeah, I think I remember, yeah let's go.\" Eli and I exchanged a scared look, shouldn't our guide be you know a little more confident in his guiding skills? \n\nNonetheless, the trail took us down a small hill away from the woods into an opening with another mountain opposite us, with a river dividing us in between. We followed alongside the rive for about a half a mile until the path just disappeared. \n\nWe all reconvened in a circle again, and our guide told us the bad news. \"So, it looks like we are not on trail anymore. We should've turned the other way.\" I was so pissed. The answer seemed so obvious, we should turn back and get back on the trail. But everyone else decided that we should follow the river because our campsite and the rest of our group was on the river up some miles. We had a radio and a GPS emergency system, if we absolutely needed. But our guide said we wouldn't be able to reach the other group with our radio, because there were a couple mountains in between us and we were in a deep valley. So if we headed up the river a bit, we should be able to get back into range. I looked at Eli, she looked just as bewildered as I did. But for some reason we didn't fight back. We shrugged our shoulders and followed our leader into the cold mountain river water. We held hands as we walked to hold ourselves steady. (\\*\\*\\*We did not follow proper river crossing technique, DO NOT WALK IN A LEGIT RIVER INCORRECTLY ESPECIALLY WITH 40 LB PACKS\\*\\*\\*) \n\nA trail started up again on the opposite side of the river from where we had come, so we hoped out and got onto dry land. These definitely were trails but not made by man. These were trails made by the countless animals that called the wilderness home. So it was completely stupid to follow them assuming that the makers of these paths had any care for human trails. \n\nAt this point my shoes were completely soaked, as I was realizing that our trek would be a very long one, I was overcome with an unknown survival instinct. I just had to keep walking. The once wide valley with mountains quickly turned into a canyon with walls of 20 feet on either side. Our group leader once again told us to get into the water. We walked up the river for about a half mile, thankfully I'm pretty tall so the water only came up to my mid thigh. But for some of the other vertically challenged fellows, they were dealing with water levels up to their waist. This was unsafe, dangerous, and scary. \n\nOn top of this, I am afraid of open water. Lakes, rivers, oceans, you name it. It feels like someone is watching me underwater, I'm vulnerable and I don't like it. A couple time I felt the stray fish graze up against my leg and I hated it. My body tensing up, and being reminded that things could be watching us and aware of our presence without us being aware of theirs. This was one of the most technical parts of our journey, because we had to look into the water to find our footing in a river filled with slippery wide flat rocks. \n\nFinally that stretch of canyon had opened up and we were presented with big sunbathing rocks on our left to climb up and out of the water. I was midway in the line, and as I was approaching the rock and the hands of those already out of danger, I heard someone behind me yell, \"Don't step there, that's a hole!\" I stepped past a real ankle-breaker just in time, but hit the slab of rock pretty hard. \"great\" I thought to myself, \"I can both die physically and of embarrassment.\" Once my group leader pulled me up onto the rock, I kind of processed how strange that was. Who yelled that to me? And why am I jealous that they could see that before I could? How could they see that? Catching my breath I looked back to thank whoever yelled at me, because I still hadn't gotten everyone's names down, but everyone was just as tired as me. No one seemed focused enough on the people ahead of them to notice a hole like that. I kind of just disregarded my questions with the free help, because someone just saved me an ankle sprain in the backcountry. \n\nI went up a little further and waited for Eli, I asked her if she thought we were close enough to radio the other group, when we heard a loud \"FUCK\" That is not a noise you want to hear when you are already up Shit's creek. Dropping our packs we ran over and we saw that Anne had stepped into the hole and fallen into the river, along with the radio in her pack. With swift movements some of the boys helped her up and got her out of the water. She got up and out completely unscathed. This is why you wear high hiking boots, her ankles were fine. Which was a major relief. Smiling that we had one little win I heard some branches behind me crack. With a quick jerk I looked over my shoulder and saw someone running into the trees. Just then our leader told us that a couple other kids had just gone to the bathroom so we had a chance to catch our breaths. \"Ah,\" I thought, \"They'll be quick.\" Eli, Anne, and I nibbled on half-wet mango slices and reapplied sunscreen. After waiting a little bit longer, our guide asked if everyone was here. \"I think we're waiting on one more,\" I said, \"Someone went back that way..\" Pointing to where I heard the sound. Anne looked a little stunned, \"...No, I just counted,\" turning to the leader, \"we're all here! onwards and upwards!\" \n\nAm I fucking stupid? Or was I just going crazy? I definitely saw someone, maybe they had come back around a different way. I was getting a little freaked out, so I decided to take the edge off with light gossip. We turned towards a massive hill covered with loose rock and wimpy brush. This was not going to be fun, but the conversation would be.\n\n \"Eli, did you see Mr. Beefcakes at the tables this morning?\" \n\n\"No! God, how did I miss that? What did he look like?\" Eli was always down to talk about stuff like this.\n\n\"Oh my god, he had longish brown hair, and was muscular and..and\"\n\n\"And... what? I'm kind of waiting here for more material for my backcountry fantasy dude.\"\n\n\"You know, I don't actually remember. I don't really remember his face.\" I didn't know what he had looked like, but for some reason I just knew I liked him? Like he just had good energy. It's not like I was in the market for a boyfriend, he just, there was something about him that was safe, and interesting. Something beyond what I knew then.\n\n\"It's okay I don't think your descriptions of him could live up to what I've got going on up here.\" Eli said pointing to her sweat-covered forehead. \"And no, I did not see your mystery man.\" \n\nEli overtook me, and I followed back behind her. Sticking my poles into the loose dirt as well as I could. New Mexico is a really dry place, even in areas right next to water like we were. The ground was basically that of Mars, top 3 inches were loose red dirt with golf ball sized rocks scattered everywhere. In my wet hiking boots I was slipping around. I hit a pretty steep section of hill there and I reached out to grab onto a nearby sage bush, but I missed it and nearly fell all the way back. One of the boys behind me had given me a nudge on my pack and I was able to grab the tree and pull myself up. I turned back and the nearest person behind me was 20 feet below. I didn't want to think about what was going on. \n\nJust keep walking, just keep walking. After 45 minutes or so we finally made it up out of the valley and onto the top of a rocky ridge. Barely making it I fell down onto a wide low rock, accompanied by a great view of the river below. \n\nWe had no idea where we were, let's be honest. Our guide remained hopeful. \"We just have to pass this bowl, cross over that ridge and drop down into the valley.\" Optimistically, \"The camp is just beyond that mountain.\" The first 10 times or so I believed him, but after the 30th I wanted to push him down the hill back into the water. \n\nCooling myself down, I looked at the opposite ridge, keeping my eyes steady on the horizon.  But a flash of yellow surprised me. Perched on a rock on the other side of the bowl, was the man from the tables. Drinking water and reading a book. This hike that had quickly become the hardest thing I've ever done seemed to be a walk in the park. When had he passed us? Are we close to the trail? It really isn't safe to be hiking alone like this, where had we come from? He only had a small jansport, the kind your parents used in the 80s. That wasn't nearly big enough to hold all the things he'd need for the backcountry. In my haze of confusion he gave me another quick wave, as he reared his head back in laughter. \"Hey, Hunter\" Anne nugged me, \"I heard you talking to Eli earlier. You were saying something about a guy in a yellow top at the campsite?\" I was stunned. She was right, he *was* wearing a yellow shirt. Like the figure in my room.. But I hadn't mentioned anything about his shirt. \"Anne, I didn't mention...\" \n\n\"I saw him too. But dude, don't freak out when I tell you this\"\n\n\"Oh yeah because that's exactly what you say to someone when you don't want them to freak out.\"\n\n\"ha ha, no one else is here. Unless he came on foot, no one else camped there last night. No other cars in the lot. No other fires last night. All of this is a little weird.\" Anne seemed a whole lot more freaked out than I was about this guy. I wasn't afraid of him at all, if anything I felt safer that he was here. Somehow a lifeline. I decided to keep me seeing him, to myself, I didn't want her scaring herself when I didn't see a reason to. \"I wouldn't worry about it, this is a pretty popular trail, he could've been a local, and got dropped off. Really don't stress, and besides we're a group, I don't think someone would take on six people, not good odds.\" \n\n\"Huh, yeah, you're probably right.\" Anne walked off towards the group leader to talk about next steps in our journey. Gathering my stuff I looked back to where the man was sitting and he was gone. Behind where he had been was a yellow bush, maybe I had imagined him. I do have terrible eyes. Shivers. Just as I was thinking that I felt shivers down my spine. No longer did I feel safe, someone or something was watching us where we couldn't see them. I wanted to unequivocally get the fuck out of there. \"Hey guys,\" Eli said uneasily, \"Can we pack up, something doesn't feel right.\" Everyone seemingly held the same consensus we quickly packed up and headed out across the bowl. \n\nAs we were making our way down onto the steady even path along the ridge, we stopped in our tracks. We were matched with the unmistakable sound of a mountain lion. Turning around we were met with the whipping tail of a 200 lb killing machine.",

        "text": "The thing is i never really wanted one, i much prefered having a dog or a cat, but since my parents didn’t want to deal with an animal i figured i might end up buying a bunny instead.\n\nI choose a male, brown one with dark eyes, since he seemed to be much more active than the rest of the bunch, running in circles nonstop and i found it kind of funny.\nSo the first few weeks everything went normal, i named him Schneider since i found it cool, gave him rabbit food, water, cereal bars, carrots, played with him, etc.\n\nThat was until one day when i came back from school and found Schneider shaking and with what appeared to be blood around his mouth.\nI got concerned but didn’t really care too much since i thought he had bitten his tongue, so i filled his water bottle with a dissolved half pill of diazepam in it to calm the shakes.\n\nA couple weeks later i find Schneider shaking even more, i could even hear the poor animal’s teeth clenching. This time i gave him the full pill. I was beginning to get worried about him since i knew he was sick, but i had to study for the maths exam i had the following day so i didn’t had time to carry him to a vet.\n\nThat night i could hear Schneider constantly hitting his cage bars.\n\n“Quiet that fucking thing already” i heard my father say from across the living room.\nI went up to Schneider’s cage and found him with an open wound on his head.\n“This rabbit is an idiot, what kind of animal hits his head against his cage until he bleeds” i thought.\nI tried to get a look at the wound to see how bad it was but he wasn’t letting me grab him. I grew frustrated so i pulled him by the ears as strong as i could to stop his head from moving and in that moment Schneider bit the index finger from my other hand, almost ripping it off clean, blood started pouring and i wondered how the fuck could a rabbit bite that deep.\n\n“That’s it i had enough you little motherfucker” i said.\nI went to the bathroom and grabbed a bottle of Xanax, broke a few of the pills and dissolved them in water with the intend of getting him asleep.\nI entered the room, and gave him the water bottle. I sat and waited until he started drinking it and sure enough he fell asleep, or dead, i didnt really care at that point, i wanted that animal to stop bothering me.\n\nWhen i was about to leave the room Schneider’s cage went flying and i heard the most horrific and animalistic shriek i ever heard.\nI slowly turned around, either too shocked or too scared to do anything else, maybe both.\n\nThe abomination that stood in front of me resembled anything but a rabbit, 8 or 9 feet tall with two heads, one looked like a horribly deformed human, with uneven shaped eyes looking in different directions, a grotesquely shaped nose covered in pus and an open wide mouth with decaying teeth and seven saliva leaking tongues, the other appeared to be a mix between a wolf and a hyena, with red eyes and sharp spikes all across its face.\nIt took me a moment to realize that those were sharp teeth and not spikes.\n\nIn that moment the wolf head let out another terrifying shriek which made the house tremble and i bolted from the room and out of the house not even processing what i just saw, not even thinking about where to go and sure enough not knowing how far should i go before i could be safe or until my parents torn flesh and screams where no longer heard.",

        "text": "  \n\nI lived in my van for a few months a while back. Not for any particular reason, I just enjoyed the idea of being able to travel whenever. I thought that living in such a small space would bother me, but I actually really enjoyed it. In fact, if it wasn’t for this story, I would most likely have kept living in my van.\n\nIt was me and my dog Piper. He wasn’t with me all the time, more of a irregular travel companion than a resident. Now, I live in England, so when I say this occurred during summer, please don’t assume this means that it was warm and sunny. In fact, the day that this began was a cold, foggy day – the kind of fog that brought an uncomfortable dampness to anything that dared touch it. I remember it clearly because I had been woken up at 5am by Piper growling – one of those vicious growls that serves more as a threat than anything.\n\nI sat up, confused. The windows were fogged up from the inside, but Piper had his nose pushed against the back glass, his eyes locked onto something outside. I tried comforting him, but he refused to move, refused to break eye contact with whatever was out there. I assumed it was a deer or a wolf or something as we are a little closer to the country, close to many woodlands.\n\nI smudged my fist against the glass, clearing the fog and squinted out. It was morning but it was not yet the kind of light that allowed your eyes to easily pick up on anything but shadows. It took me several minutes until my eyes were able to adjust. Only then did I notice the smudge that dipped behind a bush. Piper barked, refocused and began searching frantically for the thing.\n\nI wrote it off as a fox and sat back down, waiting for Piper to calm himself. I checked my phone for any notifications. The screen was so bright it made me jolt back slightly. As I began adjusting the brightness, there was a knock on the drivers side window. Piper took to barking again, a deep throaty bark. I called out a hello, thinking it would just be someone checking on the vehicle. There was no answer.\n\nI had parked around the corner from a petrol station, just off the side of the road and so I wasn’t too concerned. There were apartment blocks only a 5 minute drive away. I called out again but, again, there was no answer. Had they walked away? I leaned over to the front of the van and wiped my hand across the window. My heart dropped and I threw myself back. There was a man standing there, face almost pressed against the glass, just staring. Piper was still going wild by my side, and as the mans eyes fell upon him, he seemed to back up.\n\nHe was a raggedy looking man, pale face marked with mud or dirt, eyes wide and whites yellowed. I tried one more time to call out - can I help you? – to no avail. He stayed for a few more seconds before backing away into the bushes. To say I was startled half to death would be an understatement.\n\nIt was a little longer before Piper stopped barking, and a little longer still before I gained the courage to hop into the drivers seat and start up the engine. Normally I would let Piper out as soon as I woke up – give him time to do his business and sniff around a little bit, but I felt uncomfortable letting him roam that area. My intent was to drive a little further on, somewhere I felt a little safer and then grab some breakfast for us and let him run.\n\nWe made it about 20 minutes away, where houses became more frequent and cars were occupying the street. I found a small park by a little corner shop and thought this the perfect place to sort everything out.\n\nEverything else that day went pretty smoothly. We travelled, we stopped, we looked around, we hung out, we ate. When night began to fall, I had almost forgotten about the weird interaction that morning. I tucked Piper in and set up my laptop to watch a few movies. It was quiet. I had stopped on a long stretch of road between two large woodlands. I had walked Piper in these before, they stretched about 50 feet before opening out into massive fields. It was also only a 20 minute drive to my parents house and so I felt safe.\n\nThe next day came and went. And the day after that also came and went. We had found ourselves back on the long stretch of road again, making food just outside of the van, blankets draped over us. I noticed the gentle buzz of the crickets had suddenly stopped. A handful of birds took flight from the trees beside us. Piper sat to attention, ears pricking up and nose sniffing the air urgently. I turned my attention away from the pot of boiling soup to look into the woods. It wasn’t exactly dark, but heavily shadowed by the evening light. Piper stood and began that horrible, throaty growl again. I stood quickly and backed up behind him. I couldn’t quite make out what he was looking at, but I tried to follow his jerking head movements.\n\nA deep shadow, a slim framed individual. I squinted ahead, pushing my neck forwards slightly. I fought back the urge to speak and just watched. Nothing happened for a moment, and then I saw the shadow dart to the left, hiding itself behind a tree trunk. Shivers ran down my spine and I began urging Piper into the van.\n\nHello?\n\nBranches began snapping and leaves rustled. They were gentle and slow, but they made me uneasy nonetheless. As the shadow edged closer, I began to make out features; a high nose, thin, downturned eyes, a wrinkled smile that dug into sagging cheeks.\n\nThe woman eventually stepped out into the open. Her blackened, crusted hands held a blanket tightly around her shoulders. She was small, slim – almost malnourished I would say. But she had the biggest, creepiest grin plastered on her face. It was a smile that only reached her lips, forcing itself to use her cheeks. Her eyes remained stone cold, focussed on me. Piper stood in front of me in a protective stance I had never seen before. I was thankful that he was so large in that moment.\n\nThe woman glanced down at him and her smile seemed to waver slightly. As she slowly lifted her head back to me, I asked again can I help you? She began turning her head to the left, eyes remaining locked on me. I shivered. Piper began to advance on her, and although her facial expression didn’t change, I felt her aura shift. She seemed less threatening all of a sudden, more afraid. As Piper pushed forwards, she began to back up. As she reached the treeline, the most uncomfortable, frightening thing happened. In a split second, this frail old lady turned and ran – I mean bolted – into the woods.\n\nHer movements freaked me so much that I ushered Piper into the car, slammed the doors, clambered over into the drivers seat and started off, leaving behind my camping kitchen and hot soup.\n\nI arrived at my parents shortly after and asked to stay there for a few days. They didn’t ask questions. Thinking now, I wish they would’ve.\n\nAbout a week passed, I had the feeling that I had overstayed my welcome at my parents house (although they would never tell me even if I had). I packed my things, got Piper sorted and headed back out onto the road. The events of the precious week still lingered in the back of my mind, but they were pushed aside by the excitement of travelling.\n\nI had seen an advert during my home stay – a large cave hidden in the woodlands a few hundred miles away. I know that seems like a far journey for such a small sight, but it really was amazing and I really was very lucky to be able to go and see it whenever I wished and stay for however long I desired. The cave itself wasn’t too secluded, there was a small town just a few miles from it with old brick buildings – the kind that were still fitted with chimneys and 5ft high door frames. I think it was more of a retirement town than anything.\n\nIt was about a five hour drive, and for the most part, the journey went smoothly. Piper sat in the back snoring away, getting up occasionally to shift positions or chew aggressively on his feet. The roads weren’t too crammed and I didn’t meet much traffic which was a nice surprise. We had left early – I would say probably around 7am – with intentions to make it there by the afternoon to explore and roam the area.\n\nBy the time we arrived, the clock had just hit 2pm. We had lost time a little when we went shopping or took pee breaks – the dog mainly – but we arrived with more than enough time to survey the location we’d be calling home for the night. I always tended to carry a little digital camera with me, just for those ‘old school’ style photos. They have a different feel from the high quality smartphone cameras.\n\nI took it out, snapped a few pictures, stalked around for a few minutes making sure there was nothing that posed a threat to the pup. This meant analyzing bushes and trees and mushrooms that had sprouted through the long grass. I was confident, comfortable enough with the environment that I opened the back of the van and freed the beast. He immediately ran off into the bushes, tail wagging, ears flopping against his head. I could hear his heavy breathing even as he disappeared behind a school of large trees. I couldn’t help but laugh at him.\n\nThe area we had chosen to spend the night was off the main road, cuddled in a little corner. It was hugged by bushes and trees with nothing but a faint mud path back to show our way out. The sound of cars rushing by was faint, but there. I always felt more comfortable knowing that there were people – or at least the potential for people – close enough to reach by foot. I began to set up a little seating area consistent of a fold out chair equipped with a small side table, and an overly sized wooden dog bed, lined with pillows and toys. I had made the decision to visit the cave in the morning. I had no idea how big it actually was and how long I was looking at being in there so a new day was the safest option. As I was finishing up, throwing myself into the chair and pulling out a book to enjoy the afternoon, I heard the huffing of Piper break through the trees. He happily trotted up to his bed and circled until he felt comfy enough to drop and let out a loud sigh.\n\nAs the afternoon turned into evening and the evening into night, Piper and I were able to enjoy the gentle sound of classical music playing from the vans radio. The sky had turned an orangey red before nightfall, and from where we had settled, I was able to take the most beautiful pictures of it trying to break through the canopies. I was looking through them, squinting slightly at the small screen to see the finer details, when Piper let out a sudden bark.\n\nIt was sharp and sent my heart into a frenzy. It seemed at first that he had just been startled, probably woken from a deep sleep by a bird rustling overhead or an owl settling down to begin hooting the night away. It was only when he kept barking that I felt the need to stand and look off into the woodlands. At the time I was more afraid that it might’ve been a wolf or a fox sneaking up on me, stealthing through the brush, but when I didn’t see anything, I called Piper and began loading out stuff back into the back of the van. It took a minute before Piper was ready to peel his eyes away from the darkness, but eventually he turned and walked with me into the vehicle.\n\nThe night seemed long, maybe because of the early pack up, maybe because of the excessive rustling from the woodlands outside. I didn’t think to question it, I know I tend to overthink when I’m alone and out of immediate public view. I cuddle up with Piper who also seems a little on edge. I play a movie as I normally do and get ready to drift off. It usually takes a while for sleep to embrace me, and so I had laid through the entire movie, eyes closed, dog in arms. When I went to change over to another film, I heard a sudden and very loud twig snap.\n\nPiper is not normally the jittery type, although always usually alert. I should’ve probably started with this fact. Having lived with me in a van for the best part of three months, he had learnt what sounds were not a threat and what ones required immediate attention. Hearing him growl, or bark is an oddity, especially when his name is called and he continues. This was one of those situations.\n\nHe was growling, sat to attention, nose pressed to the opaque wall as if he could see through it. I groaned his name, hoping to give him the comforting nod to relax and come back to sleep. When he ignored it and continued breathing against the wall, growling from the depths of his throat, I sat up. I never wanted to admit that I was scared, especially not when it involved leaving a site at near midnight. I mumbled his name again, a sharp sound that came out more as a warning than anything. I saw his ears jerk back slightly. He was hearing me, that I knew, but he was choosing to ignore me.\n\nI put my hand on his side and gave him the hey, you okay boy? What’s up? What you hearing? But he continued his deep rumble. I thought perhaps it was a predator, sneaking up on me after catching my scent, full of courage knowing I was alone – or almost, I guess. Usually the answer to this is to open up the doors and let Piper bark his warnings, chase the thing for a couple minutes and then return, worn out and contempt. So I reached for the door handle and as I did, he shot to the door, pushing it open with his nose and shooting out into the darkness. The doors swung open with a loud bang as its hinges were over exerted. I called out quickly for my dog – this was something he had never done before, even when warding off a predator.\n\nI forced myself out of the van, shivering as my bare feet touched the damp grass. I peered around the side of the door. I hadn’t heard Piper run off into the woods, no rustling or snapping of twigs. I was horrified. I’m surprised that my legs didn’t give out.\n\nThere’s a man, struggling with his hand clamped firmly in Piper’s mouth. He’s not screaming or showing any sign of pain in fact, simply pulling back. Piper continues his vicious growling, shaking his head every time the man manages to pull his arm slightly further away. I wish I hadn’t, but I screamed. Not out of fear so much as out of concern for my dog.\n\nWho the fuck are you? He doesn’t reply, but shifts his eyes to meet my glare. My knuckles are turning red and the chill I had gained from stepping out of the van began to turn to hot anger. What the fuck are you doing? I couldn’t get the questions out fast enough. I began spewing threats, fear slowly creeping into whatever courage and adrenaline had been keeping me going before. If you touch my dog, I’ll fucking kill you! Get the fuck away from me before I call the police! I have a knife and I’ll use it! He didn’t seem fazed, only kept our eye contact. My dog had now mauled his hand to the point that blood was not only dripping down his face, but also spewing from whatever veins had escaped the grasps of his mouth. I called to him, urging him to get away from the creep, hoping more than anything – as most people do – that I was dreaming, had drifted off to a spooky story and was living it in my subconscious.\n\nPiper released the man and backed away slightly, maintaining a pouncing position, stationed between the two of us. I could barely focus on anything but the sound of Pipers growling when the man smiled. It was a grim, sad kind of thing – like he was actually trying to hide the pain he felt. It made my heart skip a beat and I felt bile rising in my throat. With his free hand, he raises something. It shines in the dim lights and I have to squint to make it out. At first I thought I was going crazy, seeing things that weren’t there. Obviously this was just a drugged up guy. For all I really knew, this could be the most popular place to shoot up and I had just made a really really bad choice on camping sites. He began to hold it out to me but was stopped by the sudden jerking of Piper. My eyes refused to leave his hand. I should’ve been afraid. For all I knew, this man could be showing od the gun he has on him or the knife he’s about to use on me.\n\nPipers movement seems to actually catch him off guard and he drops the metal item onto the floor. Before I could get another word in, he begins backing up. You left. His voice is so quiet and mumbled that I wasn’t even sure that he actually spoke. You left it. He repeated, slightly louder, his eyes wide and the same grim smile on his face. It sent a shiver down my spine. Then he turned, raised his mauled hand as if thinking and then vanished into the woods.\n\nI was far too frightened to call out to him, to follow him, to even move. It was only when Piper had stopped growling and inched forwards to sniff at the item the man had dropped that I felt okay to exhale. I fumbled around with my hand, feeling for the switch that hung against the inside wall of my van. I clicked it and light seeped out. It was like a small halo of gentle yellow. I couldn’t tell you how long I was stood there, my eyes locked on the trees that the man had vanished behind. I cold feel the tears trickling down my cheeks but I refused to move my hand to wipe at them. I was scared. Fuck that. I was traumatized. I called for Piper again and he trotted over to me, jumping back into the van and sitting to attention. I climbed in with him, hurriedly pulling the doors shut behind me and locking them.\n\nIt was only then that I allowed myself to cry. I began bawling, trying my best to hold back ugly sobs. Piper curled up beside me. I must’ve been crying for about an hour before I could bring myself to stop and wipe at my face. By the time I had finished, the deep dark of night had begun to lighten slightly to the fogginess of a predawn.\n\nI threw myself into the front seat, clambering to get through and started up my engine. I took a deep breath, clicked in my seat belt and prepared myself for the drive home. Before I was able to push my foot down on the gas, I glanced out of the window, a fogged up frame of glass. By the drivers side door, flat on the grass as it had been when he had dropped it, was my camping kitchen pot, engraved on the handle with my initials. My gut wrenched and I had to avert my gaze to stop the oncoming headache. Without another thought, I pulled out of the small hiding and began the long drive, hands shaking, back to my parents house.",

        "text": "  \n\nIf I’m being honest, I’ve put off writing this for a long time now. I hoped, as I’m sure most would if they were in my position, that it would simply go away.\n\nOctober of 2022 was a pretty stressful month for me. I had spent a lot of my time finalizing my cosplay’s for comic con. When I wasn’t working, I was sewing and gluing and painting. It was nice to have a hobby that could just envelop my brain and horde all of my attention.\n\nThe end of October rolls around quickly and I’m spending the last couple of days packing for the hotel, checking obsessively that I had the right shoes and hair bands packed. I had been posting on my socials (as advised by my friend) about the event and saying how excited I was to meet everyone. It was true, of course, but I was more nervous than anything. The previous con had gone so smoothly, and we were bombarded with people asking for pictures and complimenting us – I felt so unprepared. So I was confident that this time I was entirely ready, expecting everything.\n\nI had received a message from a mutual on one of my posts asking me the typical questions like how long I’m going for, what I’m cosplaying and where I was staying. I found the last question a little odd, although I didn’t feel like it was anything malicious. People ask about hotels for so many reasons – to get drinks afterwards, maybe we’re staying at the same hotel and we can catch the train together? I answered the question vaguely, “a few stops on the train”, and thought nothing more of it. They kept the conversation going for a while until it fizzled out into nothing but a “I’ll see you there!”\n\nThe day we had planned to head up to the hotel was a little stressful – we had issues with the hotel and transport was delayed. We were thankful, to say the least, that we had decided on heading up the day before con began. Wheeling our suitcases and hauling bags off foam weapons onto the train, we managed to grab some seats and settled down for the 40 minute ride. We spent a good chunk of our time chatting excitedly about people we wanted to meet and things we wanted to do. For the intervals between our rambling, we both ended up on our phones, scrolling through tiktok and Instagram. It was about half way through our journey when I received a message. It was from the mutual I had been talking to a couple of days prior. I opened it to a simple message letting me know that they had left for their hotel and are excited to see me. I replied with the “I’m excited to see you too!” and then shoved my phone into my pocket.\n\nThe train screeched to a halt and the doors opened with that gusty beep. Apologizing our way through a tight group of people, we stepped out onto the platform. It was cold and I regretted not wearing a thicker coat. The sun had begun to set and the overly artificial white lights lit the dim platform. We took a seat on one of the benches as we pulled our phones out to check the next train we were to hop on.\n\n“Is it this one? Platform 1?” My friend held her phone out to me.\n\n“Wasn’t it platform 3?” I replied, glancing up at the screen above our heads, flashing town names and times.\n\n“Was it the 7 one?” She asked, joining me in examining the screen.\n\n“6.45?” I tried in a tone that I was hoping sounded a lot more confident to her than it did to me.\n\nAfter a couple more minutes of back and forth, we decided to head inside and ask at the desk. Entering the station, my phone began dinging like crazy in my pocket. I assumed it was lagged messages coming through as my phone connected to the WiFi and, instead of pulling it out, I stuck my hand in my pocket and slipped it to silent.\n\nIt didn’t take the lady at the desk long to figure out which platform and train we were looking for. We thanked her profusely as she notified us that the next train was due in two minutes and we had to get across the tracks. Speed walking away, we headed for the elevator. We forced our suitcases in as quickly as we could and squished ourselves in behind them.\n\n“Is that your phone?” My friend asked as the elevator began to move.\n\nI turned my head to her, giving her a *hmm?* reaction and then slipping my hand into my pocket. My phone was buzzing as if it was receiving a call, but as I opened up the screen, I saw dozens of Instagram notifications. Before I could really look at them, the doors to the elevator opened and we rushed to the other side of the bridge to head back down to the platforms.\n\nWe barely made it, lugging our bags through the doors as they beeped their closing warning. To our relief, the car was pretty empty and we managed to sit down together again. At this point, my phone had stopped buzzing and, having now nothing but 10 minutes of sitting and waiting, I pulled it out of my pocket again. I unlocked it and opened up Instagram. Immediately, I felt a shiver run down my spine. 88 messages from the same person – all from my mutual.\n\nI just want to state that I had never met this mutual and we had had maybe 2 conversations following this interaction, both of which had been about cosplays the other had done. I was more than happy to find and spend time with them at con, and I had let them know this early on.\n\nI clicked open the messages and I assume my face conveyed the shock that I felt because my friend laughs and says, “What’s wrong with you?”. I scroll up in the chat to where the conversation begins and start reading. The first couple of messages are just general conversations, “hi, how are you? Have you left yet? What time are you guys getting to con tomorrow? Are you going for drinks after?” But after that, very quickly, they become something else. I read the first line of a small paragraph before looking up at my friend and reading her the message.\n\n“Why didn’t you tell me what station you were at? I could’ve given you directions, you didn’t have to bother the ticket lady.”\n\nMy friend and I seemed to share the same reaction. Her face went pale and she switched seats so that she could read over my shoulder.\n\nThe remaining 80 or so messages were all very similar. Asking where I was heading and which hotel I had booked and why hadn’t I mentioned it was X hotel and that we were lucky to make the train in time. Once we had skimmed the majority of the messages, I headed out of the app and instantly turned on my VPN, assuming this person was just trolling me and tracking my IP or something. We both sat beside each other, feeling uneasy for the remainder of the journey. When the train pulled to a stop, we wasted no time in grabbing our luggage and hopping off of the train. Our hotel was only a little ways down the street from the station and so we opted to walk – it wasn’t too dark and we were sure that we knew the way well enough.\n\nBy the time we made it to the hotel, I think we were both more comfortable in the knowledge that we were alone. We checked in and headed straight for our room to unpack. I say that, but we really just took our wigs out, hung up anything that would crease, shoved our suitcases into the corner and threw ourselves onto the bed. We were excited, and feeling it now, chatting away as we scrolled through the limited TV channels.\n\n“Do we have the WiFi?” My friend asked, pulling her phone from the jacket she had thrown on the floor.\n\nAs I landed on the kids channel, I heard her ask for our room number as she logged herself into the WiFi. I joined her, throwing the remote aside and signing myself in. The second that my phone connected, it buzzed. It was Instagram – again. I opened it hesitantly and read out the message.\n\n“I would appreciate if you didn’t share my messages with your friend.”\n\nI froze. My whole body ran cold. This person KNEW that I had read out their messages to my friend. How? We were on the train – the car was mostly empty and no one had gotten on with us, at least not that we saw. Were they on the train already? Was it a coincidence? Maybe we were just all headed the same way? I debated messaging back, but instead I just blocked their account.\n\nI heard nothing else and as we fell asleep listening to what I thought was Peppa Pig, the night ended. Morning rolled round and the pleasant sound of an iPhone alarm woke me up. It was still dark outside and as I forced myself away, I groaned, “What time is it?”. It was 5.30. I forced myself up, keeping my eyes closed and my face scrunched in disgust.\n\n“It’s so early.” I mumbled.\n\nMy friend laughed and closed the bathroom door as the shower started up. I threw myself back down and reached around clumsily for my phone. I unlocked it, squinting at the light. I spent a while scrolling through my apps as my friend showered and began to do her makeup. It was 6.15 when I managed to pull myself up and into the bathroom. I was looking through my music before starting the shower – something to wake me up – when my phone rang. It was an unknown caller. I rejected the call (as I’m sure most people would) and continued without giving it a second thought.\n\nI played my music and hopped in the shower when my phone rang again. I sighed, pushed open the door slightly and looked over. Unknown caller. I rejected it again, leaving a wet finger mark on the screen and continued with my shower. Not two minutes later it rang again. Thinking it was either important or – as I was expecting – a caller that wouldn’t stop until I answered, I swiped the call. Holding it awkwardly to my ear, I mumbled “hello?”. There was no answer, in fact, I couldn’t hear anything on the other line. I waited a second, gave another half-hearted “hello?” and then hung up, resuming my shower.\n\nI got out, brushed my teeth, stuck my contacts in and began my make up before my phone rang once again. I answered again, giving an irritated “hello?”. Almost instantly, a reply came. It was a husky voice and the caller spoke awkwardly.\n\n*“Hello, sorry to bother you! How are you doing?”*\n\nI didn’t know how to reply. Whoever was calling was addressing my as a friend.\n\n“Who’s calling?” I asked, dismissing the question.\n\nThere was a moment of silence and then they replied with something that took me by surprise. They simply stated my Instagram name. My mouth grew dry. I couldn’t speak. It was only when the caller gave a little “hello, you still there?” that I was able to respond.\n\n“Leave me alone.” I think this came out more as a question than anything, but I followed it quickly by ending the call.\n\nUnable to block the number, I simply blocked calls from anyone but my “favourites”.\n\nI pushed open the bathroom door, wrapped in a towel and began telling my friend what just happened. Her eyes were saucers and her mouth dropped open. She gave me the option to stay in the hotel for the day, but I had spent way too much on tickets to miss a day because of an Instagram stalker. I wish I would’ve taken the stalker angle more seriously, but alas I did not and we continued to prepare for our first day.\n\nWe got back to the hotel having completed the first day without any hiccups or overly weird interactions. I had pretty much forgotten about the morning incident. Taking off our wigs and jumping into our pyjamas, we chatted away about our favourite cosplayers and the cutest people we had met that day. It was nice, the whole thing had been very fun for both of us. We had been asked for pictures by multiple people, with them, without them. I had felt a little like a celebrity that day. Looking through our pictures, we both marked off our favourites to review when we got back home. That’s when my friend began scrolling through Instagram. There was a picture that she happened to stumble upon, of me and her. It was taken from a little bit away, zoomed in. It did strike me as odd because the person obviously hadn’t come up to us, but had tagged both of us in the picture. It wasn’t a good picture either – grainy, a little blurry. I didn’t think too much of it because, as I said earlier, people were taking pictures of us all day. I assumed perhaps this person had been following us for a while and just recognised us or perhaps they found out our tags later? Either way, we dismissed it and continued with our own things for the rest of the night.\n\nI had turned in a little earlier that night and so when my friends alarm went off at 5.30, I shot my eyes open and dragged myself into the bathroom. I barely glanced at my phone that morning, answering a call from my mum and a text from my dad and then throwing it into my bag. We were out of the room by 7.00 and so we opted for breakfast. The dining area was cute, it was on the second floor and overlooked the busy street. We spent our time eating and chatting before heading off for 7.30.\n\nThe day went smoothly and we ended up leaving about an hour before the venue closed, aiming for a less crowded train. We managed to grab seats, although barely, and were entirely consumed in conversation when the doors closed and the train began to move. The journey back seemed quicker that day and we sauntered off to grab some food, still in cosplay, at a small takeaway place. We watched the people walk by in their wigs and outfits, happy with another good day.\n\nLater that night, as we sat watching a tacky horror movie on the hotel TV, my friends phone buzzed. She grabbed at it quickly and instantly turned it to me. It was a picture of us, again from behind, sat on the train. It looked as if it had been taken from directly behind us, mid conversation, my head thrown back in laughter. They had tagged us. I was uncomfortable, clicking on the profile to see nothing. The only picture was of us on the train. We reported the image and both blocked the account and were forced to have yet another uncomfortable conversation about our safety. We had agreed that tomorrow we would be on the look out and would report anything suspicious.\n\n“Afterall,” my friend had said, “You don’t know what this person or people are capable of.”\n\nDay 3 went by quickly and I was actually sad when a booming voice had announced that the venue was closing and had thanked us for making a great con. We made our way slowly to the doors, sandwiched in a crowd of cosplayers and plushies. I thought I heard someone calling me then, but not by my name. I thought I heard someone call my Instagram user. I looked around as we shuffled towards the door – no one seemed to have their eyes on me. It was when I heard it again that I nudged my friend.\n\n“Did you hear that? Is someone calling me?”\n\nShe listened. I listened. But nothing more came of it and, before we knew it, we were standing on the platform in a sea of cosplayers. We stood against a wall, aching and tired but trying our best to talk about the things we had purchased that day. It was when my friend was telling me about all the figures she had stopped herself from buying that my eyes floated up to the bridge overlooking the platform. It was the walkway that led to the entrance of the venue and it should’ve been empty as security was pushing everyone one way from the doors. But I could’ve sworn that I saw someone, just for a second, looking down on us all. I know that this is just pure superstition and that I have no proof, but I swear that they ducked as I looked to them. Before I could really mention it, the train pulled up and we piled in. As we began to pull away, I tried to get a look up at the bridge again, and I saw someone standing up, as if they had been ducked behind the railing. I brought it up briefly to my friend as people flooded off at the first stop, and I think she was more unnerved than I was. She seemed to shoot her gaze around constantly, even as we exited the train and started down the stairs to the main street.\n\nThe evening had been tense and we had opted out of going drinking with friends. We made pot noodles that we had packed with the rooms kettle and ate those in near silence. Neither of us really went on out phones that night, checking every now and then if our parents had texted us or if anything important had come through. I think we were both eager to get home where we felt safe.\n\nWe went to sleep around 9 ish, both cuddling plushies we had bought. It was 1.27 when I was woken up. It was quiet, almost non-existent, but there was a knock at the door. At first I thought that maybe it was my friend, gone out and locked herself out for some reason, but I looked beside me and there she was, sound asleep. I listened intensely, trying to make out if the knocking was on our door or some other room. As I was beginning to think that it was another room, the handle began to shake. Someone was trying to get in. It only lasted about a minute, but my heart was in my throat the whole time. Blood was rushing to my head. There was silence. I stayed as still as I could, still listening. A few minutes had passed and I had assumed that it was over – probably someone drunk at the wrong door. That’s when the door beeped. The handle was pulled down and the door inched open.\n\n“Who the fuck are you?” I near shouted, shaking my friend awake.\n\nWe had bolted the door, and so it wouldn’t open past a slither. I could make out nothing more than a silhouette. My friend came to and, following my eyes, she quickly picked up on my fear and pushed herself back into me.\n\n“Open the door.” The voice was quiet, whispering.\n\nI struggled to respond, feeling bile rise in my throat.\n\n“Get the fuck out, we’ll call the police.” I warned.\n\nI was talking loudly, confidently, but I was shaking, gripping my legs to stop myself from crying. The silhouette froze for a second and my friend began to cry beside me.\n\n“G E T O U T.” I spat in my most threatening tone.\n\nThe door began to close slowly, no more words escaping the silhouettes mouth. When the lock clicked and I heard footsteps begin to walk away, I bolted to the door and pushed both of our suitcases up against it.\n\nMy friend was wailing at this point and I had to rush to the toilet to heave until I emptied my stomach. We called the police soon after, turning all the lights in the room on and staring obsessively at the door. They came to talk to us not long after and, hesitant to open the door, we had asked reception to call us when they arrived.\n\nWe plodded down in our pyjamas, sweating, puffy eyed, to give or statements. Neither of us slept for the rest of the night. When the sun rose, we packed the remainder of our stuff and called for a taxi home. The entire ride was silent, both of us looking out of our respective windows. I don’t think either had the courage to speak. We stayed together for the next couple of days, sleeping in the same bed, obsessively checking the doors and windows every morning and night.\n\nWe haven’t heard anything from the police, and so I can only assume that the individual hasn’t been caught. But I would bet that the mutual who had been so excited to see me was the one who had tried to break into our hotel room. My question is, how did they know where we were staying? How did they know which room we were in? And how did they get they key?",

        "text": "I (12m) thought tonight was gonna be a chilled out night, My Sister, Molly (20f) And Her Boyfriend, Adam (21m) Were Visiting And We Had Ordered Pizza, Chicken, Kebabs Etc. Anyway As We Were Eating We Began To Talk, Somehow It Drifted Over To The Conditions Of Residents In An Old Folks Home That My Mum Had Briefly Worked At. Then My Great Grandparents House &amp; Memories From There, I Started To List Memories Including: When I Was 2, I Had Visited Them After School And I Remembered Watching The Gardener Trim Her Hedge Whilst Eating Cheese On Toast, Another When Me And My Great Grandma Found A Frog And We Poured A Watering Can On It And More, Just Small Bits Of Memory From That Time. After A While We Somehow Got To A Psychic Who Said “I See A Fluffy Dog Hanging On A Chain Over A Fence” My Mum (For Whatever Reason) Recorded It And Showed My Dad The Audio Recording, When My Dad Was 6 His Uncle Had An Alsatian (Dog) Which Was On A Chain In The Back Yard, He Saw Something And Chased After And Jumped Over A Fence And The Chain Was Perfect Length To Kill The Poor Dog By Hanging. (My Dad Didn’t See This) My Dad Exclaimed “That’s My Uncle’s Dog!” And From There We Started To Talk About Psychics And Paranormal Things When My Sister Brings Up A Ghost She Saw In Her Room In Our Old House. My Mum Said She Remembered Seeing It Too. I Asked More And They Described Him As: A Blonde Haired Boy Sat In The Corner Of Her Room Tucked Into A Ball And Sad, As If He Had Been Told Off By His Parents. He Had A Blue Shirt And Peach Trousers. He Looked The Same Age As Me At The Time And I Brought Up That It Matched The Description Of My Imaginary Friend From When I Was 2-4, James. And I Had Made It That James Was Always The Same Age As Me. This Matched Even More As My Sister Was My Favourite Person When I Believed &amp; Stopped Believing In James, And I Would Always Want To Be In Her Room. I Would Always Retreat To My Sisters Room And Talk To Her When I Was Sad. My Sister Also Told Me About Footsteps In Her Attic And I Always Loved Attics, Something About Them. Another Law I Had About James Was That He Was Exactly Like Me. I Kept Asking More Questions And This Little Boy Ghost In Her Room Kept Matching Up To My Imaginary Friend, James. (Quick Mention: I Believe In Reincarnation) If James Was Only A Ghost This Whole Time, Not Imaginary. He Was Me In A Past Life.\nDoes He Lurk Around Me? His Creator, If You Will.\nOr Does He Follow My Sister? My At The Time Of Believing In Him Favourite Person.\nOr Both?\nMy Sister Left And I Walked Upstairs To See Him Sat There, Weeping. I Walked Over To Comfort Him But I Blinked And He Went.\nIf Your Child Has An Imaginary Friend, Pay More Notice, Not In A Hostile Way. (Unless They’re Telling Your Child To Do Things.) James Never Told Me To Do Things, He More Acted Like A Friendly Spectator Of My Life.\nOP: ActuallyAlfie2010",

        "text": "Me (18M) and my mother (56F) recently found out that my grandpa who died 5 years ago owned a parking lot in an underground area. \n\nYesterday, my mother decided that it was time to take advantage of the parking lot since it was located near the city center and finding a place to park during Christmas isn't easy. We drove toghether to my grandparent's house to get the keys. She is keeping all his things, inculing the key in a drawer. We took the two keys and headed our way to the parking. Even though it was near the city center, the whole neighborhood was old and abandoned.\nI could already tell there was something odd in the atmosphere but I completely ignored it thinking my mind was messing with me.\n\nWe opened the main garage door. An extremely disgusting smell came out and I asked my mother to leave since I had a creepy feeling. She said that I'm watching too many thrillers and that everything is fine so we kept on going while it was getting darker and darker. After a minute I had to open my phone's flashlight. For some reason my mother refused to open hers. We went down some brick stairs and got to the first level. Newspapers from the 80's and brocken beer bottles where everywhere.\n\n- \"I doubt anyone has been here the last decade.\" I said.\n\nMy mother didn't reply. I froze. Where was my mother? \n\n-\"mum?!\" I yelled.\n\n-\"mum where the have you gone?! Please show up this isn't funny\"\n\nStill no answer. I started running behind in hopes of finding her but she was nowhere to be found. I started stressing out while still yelling to find her. I went back to the exit of the parking and while getting closer to it my hands touched something. A wall? How the hell could the exit just disappear in front of my own eyes? My mind was messing with me. I sat down and closed my flashlight to save up some battery. Then, I opened my phone just to find out my battery was at 11%. I immediately tried to call 911 and then my girlfriend but there was obviously no signal. I forced myself to calm down in order to think clearly but I eventually ended up crying. After 15 hopeless minutes I was about to get up when I heard a creepy \"crack\". It sounded like glass shattering into pieces. My heart almost stopped. I froze. Thinking it was my mother I opened my flashlight and run towards the sound. Then I saw it. A dark, short figure with round eyes looking through my soul. I begun running in a random direction while screaming at the top of my voice in terror. Out of the corner of my eye I saw it crawling away. In a matter of seconds I had reached a dead end. Too afraid to open my flashlight again I am standing in a corner. My only hope is that this thing is an illusion. Maybe my mind is just messing with me again but i am sure that I am stuck here. Without my mother or anyone else. In an underground parking lot. Alone. Or probably not.",

        "text": "I was a scientist at Eurofins laboratory in Athens, Greece. A few years ago, I was assigned to a new task: running tests for a plausible cure for worldwide diseases such as Huntington's disease, or cancer. I was paired up with an employee I hardly knew, as he had just transferred over to the lab. At first, I was annoyed we were put on such a task, as I was certain we would never find any solution to these diseases. For awhile we ran tests and experiments that the lab provided for us, and we never found any benefit out of our procedures. Something changed from all this yesterday. I was writing notes in my office, when my partner practically bull charged me, his eyes wider than ever. He was always quite awkward, so a situation like this startled me. \n\n\"I'm onto something. Something big. I think I found a cure.\" He whispered, spitting and sweating on me from his anxious nature. \"Back up man.\" I yelped. \"So you've found a cure? How big?\" He licked his extremely dry lips as I questioned him. \"I've been doing my own experiments at home, away from the lab. For years I was experimenting with everything I had to try and find a cure.\"\n\nHe stared at me like a psychopath. \"Go on..\" I asked. \"Not here.\" He said. \"You have to come see it for yourself. Today after work.\" He slipped out the doors as I continued my notes. I was intrigued by what he could have found. \n\nAround 9:00 PM, I pulled into his driveway. He didn't have the house I was expecting for being such a high-class scientist. It was a shoddy, broken-down looking suburban home. His chimney had a large crack in it and his windows were barred. I knocked at his door and waited for a long time, before he finally opened the door. He was wearing a black trench coat with gloves, and black pants that made him look taller than usual. His face was beading sweat more than before, and his glasses looked like they were about explode from the pressure of his face. \"Come in, quick.\" He said.\n\nWe reached his damp and depressing basement, where he guided me to his lab experiment. I saw many fascinating things, but the most impressive thing was right in front of me. What I saw in the blood sample of all the disease the lab had gave us, he had manage to rid almost a quarter of them out of the sample. He had done this all by himself. \"This is incredible! How did you do this?\" I didn't hear anything from him, but as I looked back at him he was frowning, and his eyebrows looked like a wasp's stinger about to attack. His next words caught me off-guard.\n\n\"Didn't anyone ever teach you to take your fucking shoes off when you walk into somebody's house?\" I looked down at my shoes. \"Shit. Sorry.\" I walked back upstairs to put my shoes in front of the door when I noticed something through the blinds of his main door. \n\nTwo figures standing outside. \n\nI couldn't make much out, except that they were wearing those black plague masks the doctors used to wear. They didn't approach the door, yet they were standing a few feet behind it, trying to peer through. I hid under the blinds, and tried sneaking past the door and back downstairs. \n\nWhen I thought I was free, I bolted to the basement, where my partner was looking at his samples. \"There's two figures in masks at your door, I thought nobody else knew about this?\" I asked him.\n\nHe looked at me calm, almost like he was angry at the same time. \"No-one does, except YOU.\" He thought I betrayed him. \"I didn't do this, but we have to hide now or we're going to get fucking killed.\" He pointed to a hidden cellar that wasn't even noticeable. He had planned for this. \n\nThe door blew open upstairs and hit the ground with a hard smash. Our visitors had gotten inside. We rushed into the cellar and waited. We heard the sound of bottles smashing and liquid dripping from the table. They left as quickly as the came. We rushed out of the cellar to find his entire basement ransacked. \"It's all gone.\" We had lost one of the greatest cures known to mankind. \n\n\"I have copies.\" He opened the cupboards in his cellar to reveal dozens more samples. In the moment I realized something. The lab never expected us to figure out a cure. They didn't want us to. They provided us with none of the equipment my partner had.\n\nWe quickly raced to his car and left.\n\n\"What do we do now?\" I asked him. \n\n\"We flee and hide.\" \n\n\"Yes, but where?\"\n\n\"Somewhere remote.\" \n\nWe drove for hours, when we arrived at a tiny cabin in the forest. \"I've been preparing for this moment.\" He said.  \"I bought this cabin when I figured out I was onto something, I knew they would come again.\" I didn't know who \"they\" were. \"Who is coming?\"\n\nHe looked at me with calmness. \"They're some sort of cultist group. They have insiders everywhere. Those people you saw at the house? That's who wants us both dead.\"\n\n\"What? How do they know about this? Why do they want us dead?\"\n\nHe looked out the window. \n\n\"I don't know, but I know they will stop at nothing to rid any kind of scientific breakthrough.\" We walked into the cabin and sat on the couch, staring at the wall for about 40 minutes before one of us said anything. \n\n\"One kidnapped me and brought me to a forest like this.\"\n\nI didn't say anything, just listened.\n\n\"About 6 years ago it was. Took me, and my family, handcuffed.\"\n\n\"My wife, my son crying their eyes out in despair. Begging for mercy or the sweet release of death. They were shoved to the ground as I was held back by them. They put their fingers on my eyelids and forced them out, so I could watch.\"\n\nI shivered, in anger and in fear.\n\n\"It wasn't one, or two shots they fired. It was about 20. And it was my fault.\"\n\nHe brought out the sample. \n\n\"What are you doing?\" \n\n\"I'm the first subject.\"\n\nHe poured the medicine in his mouth and retreated to bed. I laid on the couch, paranoid about everything. \n\nIn the middle of the night I heard howling. Not a wolf howling, but my partner, in pain. I ran upstairs and swung open the door, only to find the thing of nightmares.\n\nAt first it was dark and silent, and I thought I was dreaming. Then I heard the most sickening groan ever, it wasn't a normal whine, it sound like there was a spider spewing web in his vocal cords. I looked down and saw blood dripping onto the floor from his bed. I ripped the blanket off and saw his organs falling out of his body. His head had become almost dilapidated, like a rusty brick. His mouth hung open in a crooked fashion, bearing vicious teeth. His eyes shrunk into his sockets and his foot ripped off of his body as he tried to sit up. \n\n\"heeeeelp.... please.\"\n\nI'm too shocked to vomit. to do anything. I'm hiding in a cabinet. A few minutes ago, I heard the windows break. I think they're back. \n\nThey are back. And there's a lot more of them. I don't know what to do.\n\nIt's been about 10 minutes. I heard ruthless screaming upstairs, and hollow growling, like it's right in my ear. Whatever my partner has become, surely he won't live forever.\n\nMy partner didn't die. I watched the whole thing. He changed. Into one of them. He became one of them.\n\nI don't know how much longer I have, you become one of those figures. With the masks. I'm assuming they're all people who have made discoveries in the past. Why are they hunted?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthey're downstairs i think they know where i am\n\nim sorry i failed you \n\nwhoever finds this please take warning\n\ntheyre oepning cabnets\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthey found me",

        "text": "When I was a child, me and my friend, Donan, were always considered the weirdos of the class. It was at the time every single little girl had a crush on the fastest boy of the group; so, every day, most boys of the classrooms would compete at recess to see who would beat the fastest one in class, racing to the other side of the small yard, usually knocking down other students in the process. Me and Donan were the only two that didn't feel like sweating enough to seem like we'd swam across a river by the time recess was over. We were more invested in other stuff. \n\nAt the time, things like anime, the supernatural and occultism weren't exactly famous, and we were probably the only people in class that liked them. After school, we'd usually stay at Donan’s house, since my parents were mostly out working until late afternoon. His mother was usually locked inside her office, and his father, working outside. This meant that, while we didn’t make much of a mess, we had the place to ourselves.\n\nThere was only one rule that both him and his parents insisted on following at all times; it was to never mention his older sister, Elora. She was locked in her room, in silence most of the time, with just the vocational visits of her mother. I’d only seen her face once. It was in a family picture, almost three years ago, when she was happily smiling. She was really pretty at the time, I’ll be honest.\n\nThanks to the occasional and vague conversations I had with Donan and his mother about Elora, she used to be a really good sister. She loved to talk to younger Donan about the night sky, and how she wished to live there one day; that was until she mysteriously fell into insanity across a long period of time, to the point of blinding herself with a kitchen fork.\n\nAfter that, her room stayed silent most times I visited. I was sure she was listening, since the walls were incredibly thin, and the living room was directly connected to the bedrooms and office. Sometimes, when her mother came out of her workspace to offer her food, I was able to see inside her bedroom. It seemed de-organized, and, from what I could tell, dirty, messy and covered in strange markings.\n\nMe and Donan had been best friends for about two years now; he’s told me that, when I first approached him, he was actually really hurt mentally because of Elora, and I helped him get out of his shell a little bit. He told me that the nights after Elora’s pure descent into insanity were incredibly painful, full of loud screaming and neighbors calling the police. Most of those neighbors either moved out or died a long time afterwards.\n\nMostly because of that reason, the day he asked me to stay over at his house for the night, I started thinking something might be wrong. Sleepovers would mostly be at my place, since that’s when my parents were home, and when Donan's were not.\n\nThat same day, afterschool, I went to get some stuff from my parent’s house for the night. It was Donan’s mother who took me there, alongside my friend. As me and Donan got into my bedroom and started packing some stuff, he confirmed that there was something going on at his place, but he couldn’t tell me what it was. When I asked him why, he simply answered with;\n\n“... I can’t describe it in words. You’ll see tonight” he said nervously, with a weak smile.\n\nWe were just kids; around nine to ten years old, so I just went with it. We finished packing and drove to his place.\n\nThe afternoon was as usual; we explored the park outside, played for a bit, went inside, ate everything in the fridge and did normal innocent kid stuff. We watched Naruto and talked about summoning him with a ritual, and decided against it, since we were both scared of accidentally calling something else.\n\nThen, the night came. His mother tucked us in, me being in the spare mattress Donan had under his bed. As his mother hugged us goodnight, she leaned in and whispered something in my ear;\n\n“Do not say her name. Stay quiet”\n\nDonan seemed to want to say the same thing, judging by his stare. I gave them both a thumbs up, thinking I’d soon know why he wanted me to sleep at his place.\nAs the last rays of sunlight shined over the horizon, Donan signed me over to sit next to him. We both looked out the window, as he got close to talk to me comfortably without anyone hearing. I still remember that conversation to this day.\n\n“Look, this is it” he whispered pointing out at the black sky. I looked at the moon and stars; they shined a lot brighter, since the place was in a really young neighborhood.\n\n“The moon?” I asked, just as he shushed me. He signed at his ears, wanting me to listen carefully.\n\nI followed his silent instructions, looking straight at the moon. We waited for long minutes that seemed like ages, seeing more and more stars appearing in the distance. Now embraced by the deep darkness, I started to wonder why it was so incredibly quiet. Every single bird or grasshopper, little creatures of the night, seemed to have abandoned the place; even the wind had stopped flowing the moment the sun went down.\n\nThat is, when I heard the whisperings. It was a female voice, just quiet enough to be able to hear her but not exactly comprehend what she’s saying. And then, I saw a faint shadowy hand coming out of Elora’s bedroom window.\n\n“...out..” said the voice, as the figure started pulling herself out of the window. There was something stopping her from moving further, something like an invisible rope keeping her inside the house.\n\n“...Elora..?” I whispered, as I sneaked underneath the window with Donan in case she saw us.\n\nSuddenly, her movements stopped. The whispering died down, as I realized my fatal mistake: I had said her name. \nDonan ran to the bedroom door, as the loudest of screaming filled the house. It was like a thousand voices yelling at once, coming from outside the room. It couldn’t be human; it just wasn’t. It didn’t stop, as I saw Donan signaling me to close the curtains. I looked behind me, and Elora’s figure was right at the window.\n\nHer now distorted face was covered in blood-soaked bandages, and she didn’t seem capable of speaking. She smashed her head against the window, breaking the glass and getting inside. Elora grabbed my neck, drowning me with scratched pale hands. As my screams were mixed with the other constant ones, I saw Donan pushing his sister away from me.\n\n“Elora, stop!” his screams were barely audible between the chaos around us. As he fighted against his sister, he looked at me, pain in his eyes “Take me! Please, just take me and stop this! Elora!”\n\nDonan stopped fighting, as Elora attacked him with her inhumanly long nails. He looked at me one last time, the screaming now dying down, “I’m sorry”\n\nAs it all fades to darkness, I could only see out of the window the shadowy figure of Elora taking Donan to the wilderness. The screaming finally dies down, and I pass out, hearing Donan’s mother trying to get in through the blocked bedroom door.\n\nIt’s been five years now; me and Donan’s family have long since lost contact. After the incident, me and Donan’s mother tried to tell the police about what happened. Of course, they didn’t believe most of the details we gave them, but they started an investigation for Elora having killed or kidnapped her brother in an insane mental state. They were never found.\n\nSome time ago, I found Donan’s mother in the news, who disappeared under unknown circumstances; this also seems to have happened to every single police investigator that was once involved in Elora’s case. To be honest, I think I have an idea of what really took them; they said her name too.\n\nBe careful out there, and if you never hear from me again, you already know why it might have been. If you see a shadowy figure out there, don’t approach her; maybe saying her name isn’t the only thing that triggers her now.",

        "text": " Landing a job is the most difficult thing for a lot of people. We wake up, we try to get a handle on a million different apps and search engines and try to perfect every available technique. There are thousands of HR recruiters online, searching every day and every second for the perfect candidate. And yet, despite all that… There’s a good enough chance that you still won’t find a job. \n\nMy name’s Trent Larson, and until recently, I was one of the 220 million unemployed dipshits around the globe. \n\nDon’t ever think for a moment that I didn’t try. LinkedIn? Check. Open To Work? Check. Updating My CV? I even got my girlfriend to download one of those fancy apps that get all of those pretty designs just so it would look really appealing. But the truth of the matter was that I just wasn’t able to cut it. It didn’t matter that I had recently graduated from one of the most prestigious colleges in my country, or that I had worked for a very popular Marketing Agency: I was screwed beyond belief. \n\nThe thing was, opportunities come at the most random of places. I just didn’t understand it. My old man had a history of unemployment as well. He’d worked for this big oil company and had a few bumps along the way (let’s just say that he got a bit antsy about the legality of certain measures the government was taking). I still remember what he told me on my first day after my previous job sacked me.\n\n“Look Trent, you don’t gotta worry all that much”, he said as he drove with me to my house. “Good things come in time. The key is not to lose your mind and do something stupid.” I simply looked around me, watching the streetlights pass me by as they became tiny dots of refracting beams in the distance. I wasn’t ever going to be like him. I’d spent over two years of misery when I was eight years old because of his stupidity. If he hadn’t talked, we would have still been rich. But that was in the past. That wasn’t me. I was gonna do something about this. \n\nI was gonna make it right. \n\nAbout five months ago, I was partying. Claire, my girlfriend, was paying the bill tonight. As usual. My drink was almost empty, and I could barely make out the rest of the locale. Something about alcohol always gets me down, I don’t know why I insisted on drinking so much that night. It was almost midnight and it felt like I was about to slump over the table. \n\n“Babe, are you ok?” Claire had been trying to get me to dance, but I just wasn’t feeling it that night.\n\n“I’m fine.”\n\n“You don’t look fine”, she said as she stood over me. Something about her blue eyes made it easy to focus on her face. “Do you want to go home? We can just try this another night.”\n\n“I said I’m fine. Jesus, why do you have to treat everything like it’s such an emergency?”\n\n“Well, perhaps because you’re doing this whole ‘drunken boyfriend’ bit, which is really killing the vibe right now. I mean, the overturned bottles, the tight shirt, the angry face…It’s almost a cliché at this point.” \n\nShe was right, it was a really tight shirt. \n\n“Look, Claire, I’m fucking tired, ok? Nobody wants to hire me, and we know that you can’t maintain the both of us with your salary. I’m not saying that it’s not enough, but I need to earn at least a little bit for us to be ok. Every single day is a reminder of what a failure I am, and I’d just like to be ok for one night, you know? Just forget about everything else for one night, can you give me that, please?”\n\n“Babe… I know you want a job, I get it. But you don’t need to rush it. I mean, with the pandemic, and the recession… Everyone’s struggling a bit. You just need to relax a bit. You don’t need to be the main breadwinner every day. Right now, this is enough for me.”\n\n“Well, it ain’t for me, ok? Just leave me in peace.” The moment I said that, I knew I’d fucked up. Claire just looked at me coldly for one second before turning away. “I’m gonna get a cab for the both of us, I’ll be back in a few minutes.”\n\n“Angel, wait”, I tried gesturing a bit, but she walked at a brisk pace. Might as well let her steam off a bit. It’s what I’d like, too. Maybe a few more shots would bring some sense to this. \n\nThen, it happened.\n\nYou ever felt that feeling in a nightmare, where you’re walking around in the middle of the night? It doesn’t matter if it’s your childhood home, a street, or a dark hallway. It’s that feeling that the rooms keep getting bigger, and you feel like a certain kind of darkness keeps watching you, ready to pop up.\n\nI was feeling it. Something else was off. I couldn’t make shit of anything else, but I could make out a pair of eyes in the distance of the nightclub. They seemed to belong to a shadow, or they were part of the wall. I honestly don’t know at this point. All it mattered was their color. Yellow, a sickly yellow, like that of a haystack or an insect. The kind of color that pops up in the middle of the night to warn you something’s off. \n\n“Fucking what–\n\nAs soon as I looked at it, the pair of eyes disappeared. I was alone in the club again, my mind racing and the walls spinning. Then, that voice. A stranger sat down in the chair behind me. I tried turning around, but my body was limp at this point. \n\nThe voice was like that of a mountain, falling into an abyss. It drowned out the music, the light, and all remaining senses. \n\n“Have you felt it too?”\n\n“What?” I said, feeling sweat trickle down my back.\n\n“This climate. A wave of decay, sweeping away every life as if they had never been there. No matter how much your body rattles the cage, it still won’t budge.”\n\n“What are you talking about, man?” I didn’t understand a single thing, but the voice kept getting louder, as if it was in my head.\n\n“I understand your pain, young one. Born into a harsh land, you’re trying to reap some kind of fortune, correct?”\n\n“I mean… Yeah, I guess.” \n\nThe voice laughed. It felt like ice breaking apart. “But you can’t make it happen. No matter what any of us do, we cannot defeat the impossible.”\n\n“Look, whoever you are, you’re creeping me out. If you don’t have anything else to say, I’d like to be alone, please.”\n\n“Young man, would you like to have riches?”\n\n“...What?”\n\n“Would you like to see faraway pleasures?”\n\n“Yeah, who wouldn’t.”\n\n“You cannot achieve those dreams… Normally. This world is a swamp. Nothing that enters it will grow. We were never meant to survive it. But I have. I have experienced the most exquisite pleasures known to man, seen the grandest empires, and lived the lives of a thousand successful men.”\n\nI could barely understand what he was trying to say at that moment. I was drunk, afraid, and barely awake. “Why… Why are you telling me all this?”\n\n“I know pleasure. Sometimes I like to share it with certain people. But it comes at a price.”\n\n“What… What price?”\n\n“Perhaps price isn’t the correct word for someone like you. What you would need to do in return is something more akin to… A job.” His voice echoed in my left ear, and I could feel his breath on my neck. “Would you be interested?”\n\n“I… I don’t know what type of job you’re after, man.”\n\n“You must accept it first, or the opportunity will pass, young man. You either jump towards the sea, or you stay in the burning ship. I await your answer.”\n\nThis did not make sense, of course. Like I said, someone in a correct state of mind would never say yes. Even if I worked in marketing, I had studied law in college - I don’t remember much about my time there, but you never should enter into a situation where your level of consent is dubious at best. Saying no to a stranger is the obvious choice in these types of situations.\n\n“All right, I accept.” \n\nThen again, I was never a good law student. Why do you think I never worked at a law firm? \n\n“Excellent…” Something about the stranger’s tone seemed different. I felt as if the air was getting sucked out of me the moment I accepted his offer. “You must simply provide me with some documents pertaining to your identity and tell me about your qualifications.”\n\n“I uh… I’m Trent”, I said, clumsily pulling out my ID card. “I work in Marketing.”\n\n“A pleasure… Trent.” A hand reached out from behind me, taking my ID. Pustules and a rotten smell in my nostrils were all that I remember seeing. The Stranger observed my ID for a bit, before settling it down. \n\n“We will contact you soon enough. You must not keep us waiting. You’re now in good company, Trent Larson. It would be a shame to squander it.”\n\nAs soon as he was gone, it felt like a weight had been lifted. Just two seconds later, I felt someone grab me by my shirt’s collar.\n\n“Where the hell were you?!” It was Claire. Her eyes were watery. “I’ve been looking for you for half an hour! We have a small disagreement and you just ghost me like that?!”\n\n“Angel, babe, what are you talking about? I was right here. I was talking to a man, and everything got weird and… I don’t know. I’m sorry, Claire.” While she seemed angry, something about me also worried her. “You look pale”, she said. “Who were you talking to? Did they give you anything?”\n\n“I don’t think so… I feel cold, though.” \n\n“Come on, let’s get the cab. I’ll get you home so you can detox. You look like shit.”\n\n“I feel fine, angel. I’m sorry about earlier, ok? And I don’t think they drugged me or anything. I probably just imagined it.”\n\nThe next few hours were a total blur. I remember the cab, and me resting my head on Claire’s legs. I don’t know how or if she managed to carry me, because I sure as hell don’t remember how I ended up in my bed. But I was glad just to be in my own home. Tomorrow would be another day, and I’d make it up to her.\n\nBy the early morning, I could see Claire getting ready to go to work. She was so perfect, jesus. I needed to get my shit together. My head was ringing, but I felt fine aside from that.\n\n“Ah, look who decided to grace us with his presence! It’s drunken boyfriend number 3!”\n\n“I’m sorry, Angel. I don’t know what came over me. It must have been the alcohol. Can we talk?”\n\n“Babe, it’s ok, and I’d love to talk about everything that’s bothering you, but I’m super late for work and I had to cook breakfast for the both of us. I’ll see you tonight, ok?”\n\n“Ok, all right.”\n\n“Besides, you might want to check your email”, she gave me a full, snickering grin as she said it. “I didn’t mean to pry, but you left your account open. I just saw the title, promise.”\n\n“What do you mean?” I reached for my phone on the nightstand, opening my mailing app.\n\n“Just wait and see!” She went out the door, grabbing the keys.\n\nMy mail looked almost the same as always. Some podcast announcements, NBA news, and the usual notifications. The only difference was a certain title, in bold.\n\n**Usher Consolidated - Welcome Message / NDA Document**\n\nI would normally have been very happy. Really, I would have been ecstatic. But I only felt like that other feeling I previously mentioned, like when you finally see the thing that’s been watching you while you stumble around in the dark. The moment where the yellow eyes come out the corner of your peripheral vision. \n\n“This… It has to be another thing entirely. I must have sent it to someone else I don’t remember.”\n\n“Oh by the way, babe”, Claire’s voice came through the living room. “Don’t panic if you don’t find your ID, ok? I put it right on the kitchen table. You almost left it on top of the table. Weird, huh?”",

        "text": "Father. \n\nThat's what I called the man who lived upstairs. The man who kept me and mother in his cellar with nothing but a dim lightbulb and some food and water three times a week. The man who forced me to call him father, and my mother to call him darling. I had no idea if he was my real father. I didn't really care. \n\nWhen I was little, I thought that it was just normal. I thought that fathers lived upstairs, and mothers and babies lived in the cellar. I thought it was normal to be forbade from speaking or making any loud noises, and I thought the consequences of breaking that rule was normal as well.\n\nBut even if I thought it was normal, it still terrified me. I was still terrified of accidentally dropping my glass of water, or crying if I fell over. I was terrified of being locked in a cupboard over night for messing up. Just because it was normal didn't make it right.\n\nMother and I were close. She'd cover her hand over my mouth to keep me from making too much noise and angering father at night. She'd hold me while I silently cried in her arms. She'd always make sure I was a good girl for father, and made sure I followed all the rules. \n\nFather and I never really talked much. Normally the interactions we had were him yelling at me, or maybe slapping me across the face if I was extra naughty. But sometimes we would have conversations. If mother wasn't around. The first time I remember him talking to me was when I was around 6. \n\n\"Hey you,\" he said. \"Girl. Come here.\" \n\nI knew I had to obey everything he said, even if he called me girl and not Mara, which was my real name. I rushed over to the top of the cellar stairs, where I could see a hint of light from under the door. \n\n\"What is this?\" He picked up a small rat by it's tail. \n\n\"It's a rat.\" I answered. \n\n\"See, girl, a rat is a pest. You can let it mooch off of you for a while, but sooner or later, you have to get rid of all pests. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Y-yes?\" \n\n\"This rat has been a pest for far too long, don't you think?\" He bent down to my eye level. \"You must get rid of it, girl. Show it no mercy.\" \n\nHe showed me where to grab the pest's neck, and how hard to squeeze it before it stopped squirming. I obliged, mostly terrified that he'd be upset with me if I didn't.\n\n\"There you go, girl. Now that wasn't so hard, was it? You showed it no mercy. I see you are special.\" He placed his hand on my shoulder, and I prepared for a beating. But he didn't beat me. He simply patted me on the shoulder, and went on about his day, leaving my cellar. \n\nSpecial? I thought. I had never been called anything nice before, and here father was calling me special. I couldn't help but grin, and the word special replayed through my head all night. \n\nI remember one time, I must've been around 9, when mother had suddenly fallen pregnant. Now at the time I didn't know why, I just assumed the storks had chosen my mother to carry a baby, but now that I know how babies are made, I am horrified.\n\nMother managed to keep the baby for seven months, we knew because we kept tallies on the walls for days, when her weak and beaten body couldn't handle it anymore, and that's when she had her baby, two months too early. \n\nThe result was my brother, a tiny and weak but ultimately healthy little boy who I had named Martin, to match with Mara. \n\nFather wasn't happy about Martin. He didn't like how much he cried, and how much he needed to be fed, and most of all how much attention he was getting from mother. Mother had stopped calling him darling and tending to his needs, because Martin was such a needy baby. \n\nI liked Martin. He was smelly, and cried a lot, but he was my baby brother, almost like my own little baby doll. I loved holding him, and playing with him, and mother loved that I would give her breaks. \n\nOne day, when mother was napping and I was rocking Martin, father called me over again. He told me to bring Martin. \n\n\"Yes, father?\" I said, carrying my little brother. \n\n\"Do you remember what I said about pests, girl?\" He asked. \n\n\"Yes. They must be gotten rid of.\" \n\n\"Your brother, that thing, has been mooching off of me for months now. Don't you think his time has come? All pests have a time.\" He said. \n\nI didn't know what he was talking about. \"What?\"\n\n\"Here. Place the boy on the ground, right here.\" \n\nI obliged.\n\n\"Now,\" father said, \"Put your hand over it's mouth, just like this.\" He demonstrated on my own face.\n\nI obliged.\n\n\"Girl, I want you to hold your hand there until the boy is blue okay?\" \n\nI looked at Martin, who was peacefully sleeping on the ground. I looked back at father, who nodded at me. I shut my eyes, and held down on Martin's face.\n\n\"Harder.\" Father said. I pressed down on Martin's tiny face even harder.\n\n\"Harder.\" He said again. I put my other hand on top of my hand, to put even more pressure on. Martin woke up and tried to cry, but my hands muffled it. \n\n\"Harder!\" Father nearly yelled, and I put all my weight down on my poor brother's face, until he was blue and unbreathing. \n\nFather's demeaner changed after that, to a calmer man. \"There we go,\" He said calmly. \"That was easy now, wasn't it? Now take the baby and put it next to your mother. When she wakes up, pretend you had nothing to do with it. You did a good job, Mara. I can see great things in you.\" \n\nAs I brought Martin down to mother, and wiped tears from my eyes, I couldn't help but smile through my tears. Father called me by my name! I was so happy that I had finally pleased him enough to call me by my name, not girl, not thing, not you, Mara. \n\nAs mother woke up, I quickly hid my smile and tears and turned my back to her. \n\nEven when I heard her screams and cries, I didn't turn back. \n\nMartin was a pest, after all. \n\nAfter that, father started paying even more attention to me, and I in return became infatuated with him. I looked forward to the three times a week he'd bring us food, and I began to enjoy the times he'd yell at us, because that meant hearing his voice again. Over the next 8 years, I just stared becoming more and more obsessed with him.\n\nMother didn't seem to have the same enthusiasm as me. In fact, she was planning on escaping. I had just turned 17 when she told me her plan.\n\n\"Mara, honey, listen to me. I've noticed that every 30 days, father goes into town for groceries. If we break down the cellar door, and escape through the windows, I'm sure we can get out. The next time he leaves is in six days, and that's our chance. Do you understand?\" She said.\n\nIn reality, I didn't. I couldn't imagine leaving father. He gave us food and water and called me special. But I couldn't tell mother that.\n\n\"Yes.\" I lied.\n\nBut I couldn't leave father. I waited until mother had fallen asleep when I told father.\n\n\"I see. Your mother wants to escape.\" He said. He banged his fist against the wall. \"Your mother wants to FUCKING ESCAPE? AFTER ALL I'VE DONE FOR HER?\" He yelled, and I rushed to comfort him.\n\n\"Save it, Mara. I know you won't leave me, darling, right? I would never leave you.\" He said. \n\n\"Of course not, father.\" I said. \n\n\"Good girl. I tell you what. I have a plan. Come with me.\" He grabbed my hand, and to my surprise, opened the cellar door for me to see the other side. \n\nI was shocked. It wasn't quite like I expected, there were no fountains of water or fields of grass or beautiful oak trees like mother had described the outside world to me. There was a couch, and a light, and a small table. But still, it was a change of scenery, and I loved it.\n\nHe sat me down on the couch, and I told him mother's escape plan in detail.\n\n\"I see.\" He said finally, putting his hand on my shoulder. \"Well, here's my plan. You'll work with me like a good girl, right?\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"Good,\" he said, and leaned in to whisper his plan to me. \n\n\"So that's it?\" I said. \"It's that easy?\"\n\n\"Of course. And after that, you'll get to spend the rest of your life with me. How does that sound?\" He said, smiling at me.\n\nI smiled. \n\nFor the next six days, I could barely wait. Mother was preparing for our \"escape\" and would tell me all these wonderous stories about the outside world. I just pretended to listen. I didn't actually care. All I cared about was leaving with father.\n\nAt last, the six days was up, and at 3:00 sharp, father opened and closed the front door, pretending to have left. \n\nMother grinned at me. \"It's time, darling! I have a few things left to pack; take this.\" She had sawed off a piece of wood from the wall, something that had taken her days as we had nothing sharp in the cellar, so she had to rip it off with her bare hands. I knew she had no strength to do it again. \"You escape before me. I want you to get out first.\" \n\nI started to walk up the cellar stairs.\n\n\"Wait, Mara!\" I stopped.\n\n\"In case you make it out and I don't, I want you to know- I love you. More than anything in the world.\" She said, hugging me. I reluctantly hugged her back. \n\n\"I love you too, mother.\" I said through my teeth, and as I turned around, I stifled a giggle. She was such a fool.\n\n\"Oh wow, mother!\" I called from the top of the stairs. \"Father left the door to the cellar unlocked! We can just leave!\" \n\n\"That's great, darling!\" I'll be right up in a few minutes! Go on without me!\"\n\nI kept the wooden board, and left the cellar door, locking it on the way out, just like father ordered me to. He waited on the other side of the door, smiling at me.\n\nI ignored my mother as she banged on the door. \"Mara, it's locked! Mara, help me!\" She cried, and father and I laughed to each other.\n\nAs we left the house, he handed me a pack of matches.\n\n\"Alright, darling, go on. Get rid of the pest.\" He said.\n\nI shut my eyes as I threw the lit match onto the house, setting it ablaze. Father had doused it in gasoline before I did this. \n\nThe fire burnt so beautifully, I could almost ignore mother's screams as she tried to escape.\n\n\"There we go. Now that wasn't so hard, now was it, Mara? Now, I already have a place set up for us to stay in. How about we go see it?\"\n\nFather took me by the hand, and led me to another beautiful house, just up the street from his old one. \n\nHe opened the door, and I was amazed.\n\n\"Oh father, it's so beautiful!\" I cried, and he nodded. \"Which room will be mine?\"\n\n\"I'll show you.\" He said, grabbing me by my shirt. My excitement turned to horror when I realized where he was taking me: the cellar.\n\n\"No, no!\" I cried. \"You promised me! You promised if I did everything you said I'd get to live with you!\" \n\nFather laughed. \"Oh, darling.\" He said.\n\n\"But you said I was special! I thought I was special!\" I yelled as he threw me back into the dark cellar that looked too familiar to my old one.\n\n\"Oh, did you? Well your mother thought she was special, too. And so did the last one, and the one before that. You are all the same. But don't worry- you're just a pest. And I get rid of all pests sooner or later.\"",

        "text": "After my gastric bypass surgery the weight practically fell off. In a year and a half, I went from 650 all the way to 250. For the most part, it’s all been amazing. I’ve been walking the two mile trail from my house to the river, and my knees don’t ache half as badly as they used to. I even had sex the other week where my wife wasn’t on top.\n\nThen last night I got up to go to the bathroom and saw the kitchen light was on. I knew my wife was in bed, but I figured maybe she’d accidentally left it on when she came upstairs. Nope.\n\nI walked into the room and nearly gagged. There on the floor, right next to the fridge was an orange and brown mass of pulsating fat that smelled like a rotten egg party. As I entered, the mass kicked out a gummi tentacle and wrapped it around my leg, so that I tripped forward, falling into it. I landed elbow deep in the sludge as it congealed around my hands and knees. \n\nThen, in front of my face, a writhing hole opened in the sludge and a voice gurgled out. It was honestly disgusting, like when you hear kids burp the alphabet.\n\n“I’ve been waiting,” it said. “Wondering when you’d bring me back. But you never do.”\n\nMy heart is honestly still in terrible shape. Now it was probably going 200 beats a minute. I felt breathless, just as bad as I used to get going up a flight of stairs.\n\n“What the hell are you?” I asked, trying not to scream for help. I pictured drowning in jelly, the muck clogging my lungs. I’d worked so hard just to be able to catch my breath again.\n\n“Can’t you tell?” it said. “I’m you. I’m more of you than you are. I started as just a little piece, but I’ve been waiting for you, down below, where your pipes meet the sewer. Every day, I get a little bigger, and you get a little smaller.”\n\n“Please,” I said. “Don’t kill me. I’ve tried so hard to…”\n\nThe thing let out a belching laugh.\n\n“Kill you? Not a chance. I’m here to get the band back together. Just say the word, and I can make you whole again. Admit it. No matter what you think of this new, pathetic you. You. Are. Always. Hungry.”\n\nI was starting to cry a little now. Because it was true. No matter how many times my wife told me she was proud or the doctors congratulated me on this great achievement, it never filled the pit in my stomach. And I knew that for as long as I lived, I would never be full. Never the way I wanted, never the way I used to be.\n\nThe thing reached a tendril up to my mouth, but it didn’t taste bad at all. The rancid smell was replaced with something amazing:\n\nSuddenly, it was like I was 8 years old again at the county fair, eating cotton candy for the first time. Then the air was full with the smell of churros and elephant ears. Buttery popcorn and deep friend Snickers bars.\n\nAnd then it was all gone. I found myself literally drooling, and my stomach stung like I’d been hit with a shotgun blast.\n\n“You gave it all up,” said the thing. “All of your greatest joys. All for nothing.”\n\nThen the thing put a tendril down my throat, reaching down into my guts. At first, I was gagging. But then it started to feel good, like my stomach didn’t hurt anymore. For the first time in more than a year, I felt full.\n\n“You could be so happy,” it whispered.\n\nAlmost like I was a marionette, I felt my hands lifting toward the door of the freezer, where I knew a carton of Ben and Jerry’s was lurking. It was supposed to be for my cheat days, and only a few scoops here and there. \n\n“Just be happy,” the thing whispered. “What’s so wrong with being happy?”\n\nAnd I might have caved then and there. Except at that moment, I looked at the refrigerator door and saw the picture my wife and taped there just a week before: a sonogram. The little girl she’s growing inside right now.\n\n“I can’t,” I said, wiping away my tears. “I can’t eat for two anymore.”\n\nAnd then I put the carton back in the freezer.\n\nThe thing tried to hold on, but I stepped away.\n\n“You’ll be back,” it burped at me, furious. “I’ll be here every night. And you’ll always be hungry.” But already, it was crawling back into the sink, down to the sewer drain.\n\nBut this time I didn’t respond. I took the stairs up to bed and snuggled up to my wife, wrapping my flabby arm around her, trying to hold on.",

        "text": "The Organization had always been shadowy, even within the public realm. Outwardly it is presented as a defense contractor and so under the guise of \"protecting national security\" is put under less scrutiny than corporations in other industries. Internally, this is the only known company with time-altering capabilities. The discovery and acquisition of this fantasy-like technology has never been disclosed to me, but after signing an NDA under the threat of the full legal force of the Government of the United States if I dared to share my purpose, I was compelled to accept the offer presented to me. The contract was for two jobs, one in the 20th Century and one in the 21st Century. As children filled with wonder, we all wanted to time travel- how could I decline the chance when it was handed to me on a silver platter?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo begin with, we traveled backward in milliseconds. I was told that anything further for the first time would have destroyed both my body and my mind. Slowly this built to seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years. I saw 18 different presidents sworn in over the span of over a century. I saw regimes and ideologies rise and fall. I saw the death of old technologies pave the way for the birth of new technologies. I was ever grateful to be given this opportunity but I knew I had been asked to take up this position for two specific jobs taking decades of careful pre-positioning and minor changes to the timeline in order to preserve the original fabric of the situations. Whilst the traveling outside of my two contracted jobs was controlled by me, during both jobs the Organization utilities a technology it had developed called RMC. It was a chip painlessly inserted into the back of my neck allowing them to dissipate negative emotions and to conceal memories throughout my lifetime of things seen or heard during the job- and more importantly yet conveniently not mentioned to me would be inserted for my entire life. I had not known about this before signing the original contract and by the time it was mentioned, I was too engrossed to care. Little did I know that getting into some legal hot water would be infinitely superior to the fate that awaited me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe final date I was sent back to before the completion of the first of my two contracted jobs was Saturday, October 27, 1962. Black Saturday. The day during which humanity came to within an inch of complete and utter global nuclear annihilation. Whilst the world was staring down the barrel of death and destruction, the Organization supposedly believed humanity would eventually rebuild and a new renaissance of technology and knowledge would emerge hundreds of years after the almost complete genocide of the very same beings. They had convinced me that they had used similar technology to see a future without war, famine, or suffering. A future only possible through this specific branching of the timeline- other events were tested and trialed but none produced results like the Cuban Missile Crisis did. But, as I came to learn years later, it was all a lie. They simply wanted to watch the world burn. Or *a* world burn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA Grandfather Paradox situation is created by this type of action, as the world that I helped wreak terror upon in 1962 would in turn mean the Organization, me, and everyone else alive today would no longer exist. But time doesn't simply follow a singular line, it branches. The world today and everyone in it is the result of the branch created by destroying everything all those decades ago. If time followed a singular line, the only people born after 1962 would have been born into a world of extremely few survivors, full of lawlessness and suffering. Evidently, that is not the case, at least not for our branch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing able to use modern-day technology made convincing Soviet early-warning radar systems that a barrage of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles was rapidly approaching Moscow a fairly easy task. I worked from a quiet basement in a fortified bunker with quick and easy access to my device in order to return to my original timeline as soon as the first real bomb fell. I turned the radio volume up when I had finished my spoofing job, waiting for news of the developments I created to break. Nothing for several minutes. Then, the reporter on Channel Six spoke: ***\"We are getting word of a Soviet submarine exchanging nuclear-tipped torpedoes with an American sub, casualties are reported and if this is genuine we are at war\".*** I kept a steely look of determination on my face as the reporter gathered the facts live on air and continued to discuss the development. A few minutes later, a broadcast from the President of the United States: ***\"My fellow Americans, a few minutes ago Soviet submarines and ships fired upon American vessels. We have now detected a massive wave of nuclear missiles traveling towards the North American continent from Soviet outposts in the small nation of Cuba just south of the US. Ensure you are listening to local radio stations for location-specific advice and relief efforts following this war. I have declared DEFCON 1 and I urge you to get inside, find cover, fill every available vessel with clean water, and to pray. Pray for these United States and pray for each other on this darkest day. God bless America and Godspeed to you all\".***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tuned into the main radio stations for at least 5 major cities that would be targeted first in an attack and waited yet again. Miami was naturally the first to be hit. I heard indescribable scenes of terror. People begging for help that would never arrive. Hordes struggling to find a way out that would never present itself. I traveled back to the present day seconds after that, not wanting to meet that same fate even from the relative safety of a bunker.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am opening myself up to being dealt an unimaginable fate by breaking my NDA because I need to warn you. Last month, I woke up to a minuscule amount of blood on my pillow and memories of a life where I became the destroyer of a world. The screams rang out in my ears and pictures of pure annihilation flooded my mind. I remembered being filled with child-like wonder when I traveled back for the first time. I remembered agreeing to have the chip that hid these unimaginable horrors from me inserted into my body. I remembered that my second contracted job is scheduled for October 27, 2023. Exactly 61 years after the first job. The Organization is not targeting a branch far in the past, they are targeting *our* branch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe large French window next to my bed was cracked slightly open, making it evident that *somebody* wanted me to wake up. *To see what I had done.* *To stop me from doing it again.*",

        "text": " \n\n(Part one will be linked in the comments)Yes I am alive and I am going to update with what is currently going on. In my last post I mentioned that I was last stuck in my bedroom with my “husband” cooking and singing. I planned to escape and go to my work (even though it was my day off) to check for details regarding our new “home”. After I posted my story I sat in bed listening to my “husband” sing a melody that made me even more uneasy. I eventually got up the courage to leave the bed, I put on some clothes trying to be quiet hoping he wouldn't hear me.\n\n“Honey?” he called in a sweet voice, I cursed myself.\n\n“Mhm yes dear?” I slid on some of my old tennis shoes that I happened to luckily still be packed in a box.\n\n“You should sleep in a bit more! I think some extra sleep will help clear your head.” He hummed, “I just want what is best for you.”\n\nI hated this, I felt so defenseless, a part of me wants to believe that Larry is still Larry and I'm just making this up. But I'm not and that message I wrote to myself proves it. That thing continued to hum.\n\n“I..I think some fresh air would help me.” I said my voice squeaking. \n\nThe humming stopped, and a long silence filled the air. I felt my heart pounding as I slowly made my way out of our room. The house creaked and I felt as if something was watching me while I slowly made my way to the entryway. I had to pass by the kitchen in order to get to the entry and I held my breath as I made it closer and closer. The silence was still there and all I could hear was my heart which felt as if it was about to explode. As I passed the kitchen I realized it was empty. So where was he..it? I turned and found Larry standing by our shoe rack in the entryway.\n\n“Honey? What are you?” I mumbled glancing at his hands which were still covered with gloves.\n\n“You are right, fresh air does sound nice.” He smiled a smile I now hated, “But I don’t want to leave you alone, what if you pass out again, so I thought I'd join you!”\n\nMy stomach was churning and I thought I was going to be sick. I did not want to take a walk with this thing.\n\n“I would actually..um” I was stuttering and the air seemed to chill. “ I was thinking of going alone, you know, to clear my head. You see I've been um having ....” I was rambling again.\n\nLarry took a step closer to me and put his hand on my shoulder. It was ice cold, which was terrifying that I could feel it through the gloves. I felt goosebumps all over my body.\n\n“Honey, I really” his hand gripped my shoulder harder “don't think that's a good idea.”\n\nI was just standing there like a mouse stuck in a trap, but really what could I do? \n\n“O..okay..” I tried to plaster a smile, “Let me get my sweater and you can clean up whatever you were cooking earlier. We can eat it when we get back.”\n\nThe thing paused, looking me up and down, I felt like he was seeing right through me.\n\nThen he grinned as big toothy smile, “Alright, why don’t you get my coat too.”\n\n“A..alright.” I turned around and began walking back towards our bedroom.\n\nIt was hard to not run, I wanted to leave as soon as possible, but I was patient and walked. I still felt as if something was watching me, observing my every move. Well eventually I made it to our bedroom, and I grabbed my coat, wallet and car keys. Then I went to our bedroom window, opened it as quietly as I could, and climbed out. I ran as fast as I could towards my car. I didn’t know where he was in my house and if he was still by the entryway, so my only hope was that he actually went back to the kitchen. I made it to my car, and that thing was nowhere near my car.\n\nI started it up and backed out of the driveway, that's when I saw him staring out of a window directly at me. If that wasn’t unnerving enough he was grinning ear from ear, a big toothy smile I hated. Why? Why was he smiling? He must've known that I didn’t plan to come back. So why did he look like that? I drove out of the neighborhood and I heard a ding on my phone. My heart was pounding again, the message must be from him. I didn’t want to view it, I was terrified of what it might say. I drove to a gas station near my work so I could look at my phone. I was right, it was a text from that thing, my “husband” “Drive safe see you soon.” I feel as if I am going to puke, what does he mean see you soon?\n\nI have so many questions, what is it planning? I decided to go to a hotel instead of straight to work, so I could clear my head. So I drove, checked into a room and took the rest of that day to think about what I'd do next. I am typing this in a hotel room, I plan to go to work today and view some old newspapers. Hopefully I'll find some of my creepy house and it's past residents. I also want to thank the person who commented. Although I don’t plan to burn my house down I will not be returning alone. I don’t really have a plan on what to do after going to work. I might go see my parents, but then again they have no reason to believe me. I’m also looking into priests and exorcisms. I'll update again soon, again any advice is welcomed.",
