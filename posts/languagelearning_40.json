        "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI'm a normal guy. And I have some hobbies, like all of us do. I always liked to read but since I began learning languages at university, I started to read in different languages until I reached what I believe are B2 or C1 grades.\nIt was never intended to be so, but I reached a point where I was relatively confident with my English and German, so I decided to take an examination for each of them. Even though I have literally never spoken to real people in English.\n\nI always heard about how difficult this examinations were and so on, so I decided to do a multilevel examination for both of the lanfuages since I didn't know my level and didn't want to waste my money. One is called IELTS and the other one is the TestDaF and I achieved what technically is supposed to be C1 on each of them.\n\nBut here is my question: What does it really mean? People are always complaining about these exams, and once they obtain their certification, they instantly think they are some kind of God.\nBut I don't feel so. I don't believe my English or German are that good. With all that expectations I even start to think I don't deserve them.\n\nI'm aware of my lack of knowledge when it comes to certain grammar or vocabulary. To be honest, I don't think that these papers mean something in real life. It is just paper and nothing else.",

        "text": "I've decided to start in on learning Turkish, for a variety of reasons: there's a Turkish-speaking community nearby, top notch TV shows, \"cats of Istanbul\" IG accounts to follow, fascinating history, and a pretty cool potential travel destination if I ever start traveling again. However, I feel like I've had these types of motivations before for other languages, only for the motivation to fizzle out several months into the process. Part of the problem for me is that I think I get \\*too\\* into it... I start listening to music, following sports, etc., to the point where I feel over-saturated. When that happens, I feel like I start purposefully looking for reasons to stop: human rights abuses in countries where the language is spoken (like that's not happening everywhere), specific language features that I thought were cool are now annoying, they make better tea somewhere else, etc. My logical mind can grasp that every culture has its negative aspects, but once I get into this spiral it sorta feels like nothing can stop it. I'd really like to avoid going down the same slippery slope this time around. Maybe instead of putting all of my attention on the language and culture right at the start, I can sort of take bite-sized chunks at the beginning and then ramp up the immersion later? Or maybe I should just focus on the \"work-like\" process of learning the language without getting into the culture stuff at all? idk, I've never really been proactive at the start of the process before, sorta hoping I can put something in place to stop the pattern. Thanks for any advice!",

        "text": "I don‚Äôt really know where to start‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll say this: the subjunctive is the most useless and random linguistic feature I‚Äôm aware of. If you don‚Äôt speak any language with subjunctive moods or tense (English has them but they‚Äôre usually not used even when needed), here‚Äôs how it works. \n\nYou have a different conjugation for the present, sometimes past and even future (in Portuguese) when expressing ideas a certain way. These ways include \n\nExhortation or command, Concession, Wish, Question of doubt, Possibility or contingency, Condition, Purpose, Characteristic, Result, Time, Indirect questions.\n\nIn latin languages only. I‚Äôm not aware of how this subjunctive mood acts in other languages or if it‚Äôs even present, but in latin languages that‚Äôs how it is. Let me give you some examples.\n\nHe has to go to the grocery store. In French: Il faut qu‚Äôil *aille* √† l‚Äô√©picerie. Note that the present tense of the verb aller when not subjunctive is ‚Äúva‚Äù\n\nI won‚Äôt stop reminding you until you do it.\nIn French: Je n‚Äôarr√™terai pas de te le rappeler jusqu‚Äô√† temps que tu le *fasses*. The present tense here would be fais. \n\nThese are tricky, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. The real monster in Portuguese, which uses the subjunctive future. \n\nIf I go, will you go with me? In Portuguese: Se eu *for*, voc√™ vai comigo? The present tense here would be ‚Äúvou‚Äù. You can see how different these conjugations are, even though in English you use the present tense without loosing any meaning. \n\nIn my opinion, this might be even more of a challenge to completely master than grammatical gender. I just cannot imagine how hard it would be for a native English speaker. For me, most of my knowledge on that feature transfers from french to Spanish and Portuguese, so it‚Äôs not that hard.\n\nRant minimized to not be too long to read‚Ä¶ so rant over. If you want to rant about this useless tense too, please do so in the replies, I would love to see people sharing my frustrations.\n\nWhy I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs useless: you literally don‚Äôt lose any meaning if you use the tense without subjunctive.",

(The idea being that almost all information about a given noun's declension is revealed when knowing its genitive case and its grammatical gender.) A vocabulary flashcard for a noun would look something like this:\n\n&gt;**Front**: factum *(nominative case singular)*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Back**: facti *(genetive case singular)*, n. *(grammatical gender)*, fact *(translation)*\n\nFor verbs, one needs to memorize a variety of conjugations to reveal almost all information about a verb's conjugation:\n\n&gt;**Front**: dare *(infinitive)*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Back**: do *(present tense indicative actice 1. person singular)*, dedi *(perfect tense indicative active 1. person singular)*, datum *(participle perfect)*, to give (*translation*)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was wondering how flashcards for learning hungarian words would look like.

Other than the conjugation of some irregular verbs, I guess that there's not much more to be memorized. A flashcard may look something like this:\n\n&gt;**Front**: k√≠v√°n *(present tense 3. person singular indefinite form)*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Back**: to wish *(translation)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was wondering if I'm on the right track with all of this.

        "text": "Hey everyone. This is a bit of an awkward question, but can anyone recommend online language classes where there is a lot of emphasis on socializing with others? I feel like my mother could expand her social circle cuz she doesnt go out much. Its not easy to make new friends when youre older, especially when there isnt really anywhere to go around your home to do so. But she has always expressed an interest in learning another language. So I imagine I'm looking for live classes where students interact with each other. I know a lot of people prefer the learn-at-you-own pace programs (Pimsleur, Duolingo etc.), but if anyone can suggest something live and social-based, I'd be appreciative. Thanks!",

        "text": "Let me get straight to the point. If you are an advanced language learner then the lower levels of each unit in Duo are useless, even the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù units further down the tree. You get almost nothing out of simply matching words to their meaning or constructing sentences when you are already the vocabulary, conjugations, and sentence structure. HOWEVER, at the legendary levels of a given unit (to reach the gold/purple color), you have to complete exclusively translation/grammar/listening exercises. The translation exercises you do at the legendary levels on Duo are unmatched. No book, youtube channel, or tutor can provide you with the same level of consistent, immediate, crowdsourced grammar corrections as Duolingo.\n\nFor this reason, if you‚Äôre an advanced student you should be testing out of the lower levels of every unit and going straight to the legendary levels. \n\nAlso want to note that I‚Äôm not saying Duo is all you need to learn a language. But I do think it is the best tool for practicing grammar based on my own anecdotal evidence. I‚Äôve worked my way through entire grammar workbooks and I just don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre as useful. I find that repetition and autocorrection are the most important parts of improving grammar, and Duolingo does both of those thing so well at the legendary levels. I‚Äôve been using it myself for the past 1.5 years to achieve B2 in spanish, along with daily Anki review and weekly conversational italki lessons. \n\nSorry for the clickbaity title‚Ä¶ But I‚Äôm Interested to hear your thoughts!",

Try it out for free.)\n\nI just added a new game mode to Roxxem called Lyric Puzzle which I'm really excited about, and would love to get feedback from y'all on.\n\nLyric Puzzle is a puzzle game where you match words and lyrics together. Listen to the lyric you need to complete, then build the lyric, word-by-word, before your moves run out.\n\nThink Candy Crush Saga meets Concentration.\n\nCheck out [this video of me playing Lyric Puzzle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2J7SQSNMj0), or [read my blog post about it](https://www.roxxem.com/blog/introducing-lyric-puzzle).\n\nIt's a whole new way to learn song lyrics, and unique in this space, as far as I know. I've been using it to learn \"Despacito\" myself and I think it's pretty fun and effective :)\n\nTry it out and let me know what you think! This is only the first version of the game, so with your help it will continue to get better.\n\nHugo",

To improve my school grades in English &amp; French, I started reading multilingual children's books. Those books told the story in two languages. Each page was translated in German (my mother tongue) and English or French respectively. Hence, I was able to switch back and forth, whenever I did not understand the English/French wording or concept. The story was identical. \n\nNow. 20 years later, I am learning Spanish and am researching multilingual books in Spanish/English. Unfortunately, I was not able to find interesting multilingual books for adults. \n\nAs a move of last despair, I am turning to you, to ask if you came across any interesting/ exciting multilingual books for adults (Spanish/English).\n\nThank you and have a lovely day!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers\n\nChris",

Mastering the input, this takes much less memory space than output since one doesn't have to look for words and stuff, just being exposed. Hence, one can have more active languages of that \"input only\" type.\n2. Mastering input &amp; output, this takes much more memory space as one needs to look for words, expressions etc.\n\nAlso, I need to add the limited supply of daily energy and time to the equation. Which makes it hard to maintain multiple languages and what got me thinking of that biological limit. Obviously, it is hard to put any number to that as it depends on too many factors. (language family, motivation, learning capacity, discipline, etc.)\n\nI'm talking about really high level skills and not intermediate and below as I'm interested in them but there's surely also a limit to them.\n\nHave you ever come to such a limit? Has it bothered you? Do you think there is a limit at all? Personally, learning too many languages (in a rather short period of time) has confused me to the point where I couldn't find the juicy advanced words I once knew, which is why I'm not interested in learning too many languages during this life.",

From age 2, I have been traveling between the US and Russia yearly, so I was pretty much equally proficient in both languages by around age 7(?), even though Russian was my native language, I guess English would be my second native language in this case, although I typically mark it as ‚ÄúL2.‚Äù I never had any problems expressing myself clearly in Russian until recently. Losing this language is a big fear of mine, as language is part of my perception of the world. When I speak a different language, I experience a completely different way of thinking, and different types of emotions, that I would simply not able to experience being monolingual. When speaking in Russian, I very often make grammatical errors now, and I often have to direct myself to the internet to know if the sentence I structured was grammatically correct. A bit ago on Reddit, I asked how to stop this process of attrition (which I wrote in Russian), and I was told that I have to constantly be immersed in the Russian sphere (e.g. reading books, watching films, etc.) Since then, I have been reading and watching Russian films daily, but I still feel as if my language isn‚Äôt as strong enough as it was before, maybe even weaker now than when I originally asked the question. I can feel my Russian fading away more and more every day the more I speak to people. I even took the time to relearn most of the grammatical rules, as I was always cautious of making grammatical mistakes in Russian and fearing that it would make other, more proficient, native speakers look down on me, but I feel as if learning the rules of the language made me lose some of my intuitive grammatical abilities. To sum it up, everything I do pretty much doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs working. How should I go about this?",

I'm already taking weekly Kurdish lessons and now I'm taking part in a challenge where we receive a Kurdish text everyday in January. But I'm afraid that the more I'll progress in Turkish, the worse will my Kurdish become because usually, this is what happened and happens to Kurds in Turkey. So, I'm afraid that if I go too deep into Turkish, this may become so comfortable that I'd no longer need Kurdish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you have any advice? \n\nThanks",

I'm currently at around 134 hours of CI. In early 2024, I'll be going to a Spanish speaking country (likely Spain, Mexico, or Colombia) for around 10 days with the intent of not using English at all during my trip.\n\n*CI w/ Visuals I'm Utilizing:* DreamingSpanish, YouTubers such as Espa√±ol con Juan, Spanish with Antonio, Spanish After Hours, and Easy Spanish, as well as native content (mostly reality TV shows). Occasionally I will watch a documentary in Spanish. \n\n*Audio w/out Visuals I'm utilizing:* Mostly the same YouTubers just played via other means. I typically only listen without visual aids when I'm driving or laying in bed. \n\n*Reading I'm doing:* Mostly news articles on major media sites. \n\n*Speaking Output:* Little to none. Occasionally a voice message on WhatsApp.\n\n*Writing Output:* Minimal. Maybe once a day some light conversation on WhatsApp.\n\n*Grammar Study:* I do grammar study when I run into repeated concepts I don't think I'm quite getting. For example, uses of \"Haber\", pronouns like \"Lo\" &amp; \"Le\", etc. \n\n*Flashcards:* At this point I'm mostly still stacking my deck with verbs and definitions. I do study them occasionally, but I spend far more time inputting than studying.\n\nI typically only log CI hours if they have a visual component attached to them. \n\nFor my daily routine:\n\n- News article with breakfast or in the sauna at the gym\n\n- Passive listening to a podcast or video while commuting\n\n- Beginner DreamingSpanish video to \"warm-up\"\n\n- An hour or so worth of YouTube content or an episode of native content\n\n- Grammar study on concepts for the day\n\n- Light messaging between my Lang Exchange partner on WhatsApp \n\n- Active listening to the first few minutes of a podcast while winding down\n\nAlthough most of the CI methodologies say to hold off on outputting, I feel it helps me to find holes in my knowledge, especially as it relates to minor function words in everyday conversation (ex: either, just, though, did you, will you, mostly, whatever, etc.). I don't feel like I'm quite ready to speak, but I think trying to put the thoughts on paper when they arise in real life conversations helps.\n\nI tried a tutor on iTalki when I was at zero and didn't feel like I got a whole lot out of it. I felt like I needed at least some knowledge to maximize the cost/time I was putting in. I may try to get another tutor when I'm at around 300 hours or so or feel more comfortable outputting.",

I would suspect I am at B1 currently. \n\nI have a full-time job as well as many other hobbies, so realistically, I could only dedicate 30 minutes a day across a 11 month period. Any suggestions on strategy, literature, resources etc etc. \n\nWould love to hear back with some recommendations.",

My goal for '23 (12 months) is to learn Spanish, Business Spanish to be precise.  I want to acquire language skills that are useful in an office/business environment. I am willing to spend 30min up to 1 hr per day for studying but don't know where to start I was thinking to use one of these popular apps and read business news and make notes, not sure if this is the best way, so any ideas /recommendations very much appreciated - thanks!",

        "text": "best advice/resources for transitioning learning into a classroom? (at an advanced level)\n\nHello friends\nSo up until this point, all of my Spanish classes have been online because covid. I will be starting advanced Spanish this upcoming semester and I fear I‚Äôm about to have my brain fried. Not only have I been slacking off this past semester, but  I haven‚Äôt had any in person Spanish instruction since late 2019. (And that instruction was shotty at best.)\n\nI even emailed my professor and asked for tips directly from the source but he never answered üôÉ\n\nI‚Äôm currently using clozemaster, duolingo, listening to spanish music, the duolingo podcast, and I‚Äôm rewriting all my notes from my elementary and intermediate classes. \n\nI‚Äôd really like to not spend too much money so free resources are preferable, but if you know of a really good one that costs money I still want to know just in case lol. I also don‚Äôt really want to do any virtual tutoring/conversation although I know it would be beneficial because I‚Äôve done it before. I just don‚Äôt have a stable enough internet connection sometimes and it makes me a little bit anxious. \n\nAlso ngl I am almost definitely not ready for advanced level Spanish but I‚Äôm minoring in Spanish and I need to stay on course. I‚Äôm also hoping that throwing myself into it might just help it click more. \n\nI really appreciate any help (because I‚Äôm lowkey starting to panic lol)",

Since we are also worried about the continued research that has been going on regarding how kids brains develop when exposed to cartoons that have rapidly changing pictures (ie: coco melon, baby Einstein, etc..) I‚Äôm kind of leaning away from letting them watch cartoons at least while still very young.\n\nSo I was wondering what your suggestions are in regards to teaching a language to a baby when you are not fluent in it?",

(Short term or permanently) looking for experiences from others.\n\nCurrently I am living in the country of my TL. I didn't travel here for the language, but rather have tried to pick up enough now that I live here.\n\nI got to a basic level, then stopped studying and just used whatever I needed to buy groceries and get a cab. Now I'm back to studying in classes and hope to develop my skills some more. While I'm here, I'm very excited to learn as much as I can, convey my ideas better, and maybe dip into the books scene here too.\n\nBut the more I think about it I don't actually know if I will wanna keep studying it after I leave (maybe in 6-12 months), and it is no longer a matter of survival. At least, I will probably take an extended break.\n\nMy TL is probably the most prominent in a non-indo European family. I feel like native speakers always ask; \"why study our language?\". There are some diaspora communities in my home town, and I have been able to use a bit of the language in other countries too.\n\nI guess I just want to hear from anyone with similar experiences. After a study program or stint abroad...did you continue the language? Or did you just seal the language up with the whole travel experience?",
