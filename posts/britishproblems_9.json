Where did it go? Why does it exist no longer? Companies obviously still have the capacity to produce it as it's still in Neapolitan tubs, but the concept of a tub of basic chocolate ice cream on its own seems to have gone out to pasture, with nothing in offer but bitter dark chocolate or some seven-teen flavoured aberration.\n\nGive me my plain choccy back, you charlatans.",

Then I go to set up online banking. Go through security but have to ring them for validation code, all good. Second validation pops up and says it will send a code through the post, yes dear reader, the post in 3-5 working days. So an all online bank using all of the lovely technology but I can’t set up completely until I get this letter.\n\nIn the meantime they are happy to help me with any banking needs I have, errrrrrrm what banking needs could you help with as I can’t get into my account because I have to wait for a letter.",
