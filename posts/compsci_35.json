(This is where I think I'm gonna be wrong)\n\nAnd through cache side channel attack, attackers can get data.\n\nNow what has the kernel memory got to do with this, and how does the KAISER patch slow down the CPU?",

The CS program here is relatively applied in my opinion. So I went and talked to the Department head of CS and asked about substituting upper division math courses for some of the applied courses since I am interested in grad school in CS. The courses I am thinking of replacing are 1. Web Engineering, 2. Operating Systems, 3. Only take 2 of the 4 software engineering courses required. \n\nI am not sure which math courses would be best to use instead of these other course. \n\nFor the CS major we have to take Calc I, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math I&amp;II, Intro to Stats and that is it.\n I have taken Calc I-III, and currently in DEQ's, Linear algebra, and Intro to Stats. \n\nThe courses I am thinking of taking are 1.Intermediate Statistics, 2. Applied Linear Regression, 3. Advanced Probability, 4. Advanced Bayesian Stats.\n\nI am also interested in taking Numerical Analysis I&amp;II (these are only offered in the math department). And there is also a intro to proof course, advanced calculus (Analysis) and abstract algebra that might be useful. \n\nI can only pick around 4 or 5 of these courses to replace some of the applied courses in my major. I am interested in Machine Learning/data science, Computational complexity, computational geometry/graphics, also very interested in a computational neurosciences program with a heavy CS focus. \n\nHere is a link to my program requirements: http://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/programs/NyW7f7-nsZ?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Computer%20Science&amp;bcGroup=Department%20of%20Computer%20Science%20and%20Electrical%20Engineering&amp;bcItemType=programs \n\n ",

One past demonstration was calculating pi by randomly picking points and checking if they're within a circle.\n\nIt seems at that age kids are starting to get interested in hardware, so maybe some simple number-crunching that seems impressive?
