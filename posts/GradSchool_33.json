        "text": "I am going to be graduating college in three years instead of four, and during my \"fourth/senior\" year, I will be doing my M.A. (graduating Bachelors May 2023, graduating Master's May 2024). I will be staying at the same college. (This my path, not up for discussion in the comments). \n\nOn the Fafsa, this classifies me as an independent student. I plan to hopefully take out government loans to help pay for this along with my own contributions. My parents do contribute a set amount of money to me each year that I route towards rent and then pay for tuition and other expenses with the loans, loan refunds, and my own money. I also have received scholarships from my school and state the past three years, but I think they may be mainly undergraduate-related. My parents make a rate of money that qualifies me for some federal aid, not sure of exact amount but I've received some of the Pell grant 2 of 3 years. \n\nI make a few thousand dollars, probably from 3-6k per year from jobs or internships, but not any sort of full time income. Not consistent month per month since most are seasonal.\n\nShould I include my parent's info on the FAFSA? It is essentially my \"senior\" year of college, but this year the FAFSA classifies me as an independent student, so I'm not sure if it is better or worse to include it for financial aids sake. I was wondering if anyone has any input or has been in a similar situation. Thank you.",

        "text": "\nI have been working as a RA in an experimental psych lab for about 3 years. I am a stats major so I’ve mostly been doing statistical analysis projects on the experiments that have been run. For 3 years, I have not once inquired nor thought it was possible, for me to publish my work on a paper. I know my advisor (whose just an independent researcher for the university, not a professor) as published things, I’ve seen them in the halls. However, not once has any of my work been put in a paper, been put on a poster, or anything. I thought that, hey, maybe undergrads can’t publish, and that’s what grad schools are for.\n\nAs I’ve been applying to graduate programs in stats, I’ve seen undergrads have their names on papers and published. And to be honest, I’m quite livid. I know this post may sound like I’m a naive ungrateful undergrad RA, but why hasn’t my work been published, put on a poster, or heck, why hasn’t this discussion been brought up by my advisor? Every time I do an analysis he goes “oh nice work, now we’re doing this other experiment and here’s the dataset and you can work on this”. \n\nI’ve wanted to publish my work for years, and have even thought about it more as I’m seeing undergrads who have applied this cycle have gotten the opportunity to publish in their labs. But now I ask, why not me? I started jumping to conclusions, “is he stealing my work? Is he just using me? Is he exploiting me?” But I write it off as I don’t know what the process of getting a grant for a project and how academia works, maybe papers aren’t the end goal of the project.\n\nI’m a senior, and I feel like I’ve put enough work to have this conversation with my PI/advisor. Do you think it would be rude of me to ask him? “Hey Dr.xyz, can I publish xyz work? Can I present xyz work at a poster presentation?” Is that fine?\n\nHonestly I’m open to hearing what you guys say, because I don’t really know how this works, and this post totally seems like I’m coming off as a brat.",

Every time I try to make progress I get stuck, need to discuss but can’t. Should I just give it up?

        "text": "Hello everyone, currently pursuing my masters but I'm really reaching a boiling point when it comes to my fellow colleagues. I honestly thought I'd be able to talk  with people who have common interests with me. What I got instead were people who have a \"know it all\" attitude towards everyone even teachers in some cases. There will be times someone will ask something in class and people will raise their hands to answer the question instead of the teacher in the most condescending way possible. They know all the state of the art methods, they have worked on every possible thing we are gonna be taught in class and whatever problem someone might come across they find it easy. \n\nWhen I first came across this behavior I was fine with just ignoring them and keeping social interactions to a minimum however, as the courses get harder seeing them like that is ticking me off. A teacher could be explaining a really complicated concept and you can see everyone focused trying to grasp it, not them though! They just nod their heads acting like what the teacher is saying is the most obvious thing in the whole wide world, I starting calling them bobbleheads because of that. \n\nSorry for the long text I had to get it off my chest and ask if anyone had any similar experiences with people like that? In the long run I would like to pursue a phd thinking how awesome it can be to talk about specific stuff with a bunch of different people but maybe this behavior is more common when it comes to phds? \n\nAny tips on how to deal with this will be greatly appreciated!",

Now that I’m away from my program, I realize that’s it’s not normal to be scared of 1 on 1 meeting or to freeze up when your advisor asks you questions. (He would often yell a lot or talk down to me). I genuinely liked research after working as a undergraduate research assistant for a different lab but I don’t think I can say the same after graduating with my master’s. The lab culture of the previous lab group was much more positive and supportive.\n\nThe whole experience of graduating feels pretty underwhelming and I’m experiencing really bad imposter syndrome after how my advisor treated me despite me being competent enough to land almost 2 jobs in my field after graduating.

I just completed my first semester of a math PhD program with the  intent of pursuing analysis and... well, I got what's considered a 'bad  grade' in my program for the first semester course in real analysis  (\"AB\"). Allegedly getting a \"B\" is equivalent to failing the course. I  got pretty terrible scores on the exams and everyone else around me  seems to be much more prepared than I am for PhD coursework, so this  isn't that big of a surprise.\n\nHowever,  now I'm worried if this is a sign that from my professor (who is a big  name in analysis) that this is not the area of research for me to  pursue... **is it worth continuing on this path if I can't even do well in the \"introductory\" core coursework?**  Originally I figured my grades shouldn't matter THAT much as long as I  don't end up on academic probation and pass qualifying exams, but the  comments from many of the other grad students and some of the faculty that I've heard all semester long are getting to me. \n\nSorry for the possibly stupid question/rambling. I am a first generation  student so I don't really have anyone else to talk about these concerns  with. I just feel like the world's biggest fuck up because I literally came to this school \\*because\\* I want to do analysis and they are a great department for it, and I seem to be the only person interested in this  field who can't ace these classes. I'm also feeling kinda shamed for my \"terrible\" performance because some of my peers are taking way more classes than I am, putting in far less effort, and still doing better than me. :(",

They left the job and are now applying to speech language pathology graduate programs. So, this isn't a typical \"professor writing a student a letter\" situation. \n\nHowever, we did have a trainer-trainee relationship, in that I provided this individual with on-the-job training over a period of time. At the end of that training, they obtained a professional certification required for their job. After that, they job-shadowed me for a time, worked with me on various projects, and then eventually worked on their own.\n\nWith that in mind, I've got a few questions:\n\n1. Is a one-page letter ideal?\n2. I plan on highlighting a few examples of positive professional characteristics of my former coworker. Is this the right focus for the letter?\n3. This is a letter of recommendation for them, not me, so, other than in the context of explaining my relationship with the person, will my audience care in any way what *my* credentials are (i.e., do I need to explain why I'm a desirable letter-writer in the first place, that I have a Ph.D. and pubs, etc?)?\n\nAny other advice would be great too, if you have it.

I didn’t have any jobs lined up, have a scholarship and have a graduate assistant (GA) position set up so I have a tuition waiver (the school will pay for 6 of the 9 credits I have to take as a GA). I’ve been applying for internships and full time for fun since I graduated with my undergrad in biomedical engineering this December. Well one company I really like that is near where I live has set up a second interview with the hiring manager and I’m not sure how I should go about it. I told the recruiter in the first interview that I wanted to try to do my masters since it’s only one year and they offer online and after 5 PM classes. But I didn’t tell them about the GA position which is technically part of the job I’ve had for the last 2 years (and has become really a family to me). I was going to see how the interview plays out since I’ve applied and interviewed for 2 other positions with this company and I just really like the company and engineering products they make. I know it would be really stupid to turn up a full time position just to stay at a part time job and I can always do the masters later but I just feel a little bad since I was really excited to TA a course this GA position would have me do.",

The websites are so vast and it just seems like a game of clicking and clicking and clicking. Are there more efficient ways to figure this out? Also, if anyone has suggestions I’ll list my interests here. I have a math and earth science background, so I want to do modeling/statistics related to the earth sciences to hopefully find innovative solutions. Those solutions can be for climate change, biodiversity loss, pretty much anything environmental interests me. If any of y’all have suggestions, I’d be so happy!",
