Initially, I planned to use this as an avenue to get into Investment Banking (or other finance positions) as a career. However, after doing some finance courses, I have realised that there may be too much maths in these roles, and this is something I don't think I would do well in. Hence, I decided to switch to software engineering as a career but, during university, law has also piqued my interest. I have a few questions.\n\n1. How much maths is in a finance major? And also, how much actual maths/calculations is involved in the finance industry?\n2. Would switching to a law/cs double degree be a good move? The only reason I am considering this is because I definitely want a second degree with CS, and could use law/cs to go into IP law or be a patent attorney if I desire?\n\nSince this is a law subreddit, I am mainly concerned about the answer to the second question.",

The assignment says we are allowed to collaborate so I'm not violating any honesty code by asking for help. \n\nThe issue is whether a U.S. subsidiary, who is the e-discovery vendor for a few other U.S. subsidiaries as well as the parent corp (in Germany), will be able to protect the other subsidiaries and parent's documents from discovery. \n\nAll the case law I've read says they can't. If they have possession of the documents (which they would because they're the e-discovery vendor), then they have to produce them if they're relevant.  But the second part of that issue is \"What steps should they take to minimize the risk?\" which leads me to believe that they can minimize the risk. The prof wants us to point to case law to answer the question (there is no specific jurisdiction). We didn't cover anything like this during the semester so I'm not even sure where to start. \n\nThe only answer I'm coming up with is that the e-discovery vendor subsidiary would have possession, custody, and control over all the documents, so of course they would have to produce them if they're relevant. That seems too easy but maybe I'm overthinking. I'm just looking for a keyword or issue to point me in the right direction because I'm very lost.\n\nSorry if this is confusing, I'm tired.",

Could I please get feedback on anywhere my analysis is wrong or in the wrong order? Just confused on the basic steps prior to the Hanna analysis. \n\nFrom what I understand: Once we are in the grey area between substantive and procedural law, and in federal court under diversity jurisdiction, we are considering whether to apply state law or federal (law?). \n\nThen some sources mention that any federal provision such as statute, treaty, or constitution that is on point with state law will be applied over state law due to the supremacy clause.\n\nMost sources distinguish FRCP from \"federal statutes\" as their own category, and that if there is an FRCP \"on point\" for the issue, we split off from the erie analysis and apply FRCP if it conflicts with state law, or apply both FRCP and state law if they don't conflict. \n\nIf there is an \"uncodified\" federal policy on point that does not conflict with a state law, then we just follow the federal policy?? However, if there is a federal practice in conflict with state law on the issue, we proceed to Hanna part 1. \n\nAt this point we check for any supreme court precedent on the issue and resolve it using the precedent if it fits closely to facts of issue.",

They work under someone who works at law school (not sure if he‚Äôs a professor, or what exactly he does). So her boss was able to get her into law school. This is what i‚Äôm not understanding and seems odd to me. She didn‚Äôt take the LSAT for admissions, she took the baby bar instead (which a long time ago she said was so she could skip her first year of law school, but as of recently she told me she was a 1L and the baby bar was so she could be at the same level as her peers. I‚Äôm in the process of applying to graduate school (not related to law at all) and all my programs require 3 LOR. I was asking her some questions and she told me she only needed 1 LOR and that the one from her boss sufficed. I thought that was odd, especially since stanford is considered a prestigious school. \n\nI also saw you can look at stanford profiles, but i did not see her name when searching her up. But idk if they include all their students on there. I also have her location and she turned it off the week before school started, which is what made me become skeptical. As of yesterday one of my other friends mentioned that our friend told her she was a 2L, but told me she was a 1L which now has me questioning everything.  \n\nI guess my question is- is it possible to even enroll in a school this way?? Seems way too easy to get into law school this way but she has always had good luck.\n\nIt seems extremely weird to lie about something like this, but everything seems off and doesn‚Äôt add up for me. Hoping someone can clarify before i confront them. \n\nTLDR: bestfriend might be lying about being a law student",

Took the NYLE today, and 70% of the way through forgot the rule against and accidentally clicked Control F once on my outline (LITERALLY ONCE). \n\nIt‚Äôs second nature to me when looking through my outlines and hours into the exam I forgot. Am I screwed? Are they going to invalidate my score? \n\nExemplify didn‚Äôt close out my computer. And we were allowed to have electronic outline just not use the Control F. I closed out my outlines and just used my printed version right after so that I didn‚Äôt accidentally do it again",
