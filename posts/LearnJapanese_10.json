the market for Japanese grammar instruction. Commonly used textbooks such as *Genki* and *Japanese for Everyone*, though not without their merits, are weighed down with many dense pages of exercises and vocabulary lists. Furthermore, the amount of time they dedicate to explaining the grammar of the Japanese language is surprisingly small.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, we have dedicated Japanese grammar references such as *A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar*. Such books, though impressive and important sources for dedicated students of Japanese, are not structured presentations of Japanese grammar. Rather, they are alphabetically-ordered works into which students must dip as and when necessary. It seems unlikely that even a dedicated student could learn Japanese grammar primarily from such works. \n\nIt is difficult for beginning students of Japanese to find a single, concise source that will provide them with the grammar they need to really get to grips with the language. Too often, grammar points are presented in isolation, and their significance in the language as a whole is not explained. Other works are happy to present ‘Telling the Time’ or ‘Family Members’ as fundamental grammar topics, despite them being nothing of the sort. What is required, it seems, is a readable, casually-delivered yet intellectually serious attempt to bring together in a single work enough Japanese grammar to facilitate the further acquisition of the language. \n\nHence the name of this book: *Your Japanese Grammar Skeleton*. My claim is that if the reader can process (not just read, but process!) the information herein, they will not find *any* new piece of Japanese grammar they might encounter in the future to be alien or baffling. Difficult, perhaps. Confusing, very possibly. But alien or baffling, no. The grammar in this book constitutes the skeleton that the continuing studies of the dedicated student will go on to flesh out.\n\nA brief discussion of the book’s structure will be helpful here. It consists of five sections, each of which is divided up into ten items. Each item consists of a presentation on a specific topic in Japanese grammar, though other pieces of information separate from, but relevant to, the chosen topic will also be introduced as necessary. At the end of each section there will be a short recap, where we briefly consider the material presented in the section in question. Before the first section, we will have a prelude, and before each of the other sections, an interlude, in which we consider at length some of the thorniest topics in Japanese grammar. \n\nThe book presents no exercises or practice drills. It does, on the other hand, present an abundance of example sentences to allow you to see Japanese grammar in action. Japanese sentences are presented in two versions: with and without kanji. They are not presented in romaji. Students who cannot yet read hiragana should learn it before attempting to use the book. They will need to learn it eventually anyway, and it is really not as difficult as it might seem. \n\nMy presentation of Japanese grammar will undoubtedly fail to satisfy at least some of its readers. Some will say that it includes topics that are not important for beginners, others that it does not include certain topics that beginners do indeed need to know about. So be it. There exists no perfect presentation of the grammar of *any* language, and this presentation has been influenced by my own interests and idiosyncracies. I can only say that they are the interests and idiosyncracies of an author with a very long relationship with the Japanese language, who has thought extremely hard about how best to present it to those who are new to it. \n\nOne thing in closing. It was virtually impossible to limit the grammar in the example sentences to the grammar that had already been introduced. As such, students will certainly encounter, here and there, chunks of grammar they have not yet seen as they work through these sentences. This is not a reason to feel discouraged or perplexed. Keep working through the book and these mysterious chunks will gradually be introduced and explained.",

        "text": "Now, from what I've seen a lot of people seem to think this is a bad way to practice, but hear me out. Sorry for the incoming wall of text as well, bear with me for a second.\n\nI have done 50/cards a day for the last few weeks, 25 in the Refold JP1k deck and 25 in the Core 2.3k deck. If you're unaware, JP1k's basic setup is that it has a 3 layer card, where you have the kanji on the front, then you hit a button that shows the reading and plays a sound bite of it read aloud, and then you flip it on the back for the meaning. Core2.3k's basic setup is that there's *just* the kanji on the front, then sound/reading etc stuff on the back. It may seem stupid, but since I am doing many cards a day, I stopped doing the 3 step system for the JP1k deck, and instead I have it auto play the sound on the front of the card, then I flip and see if I recalled the meaning of the vocab associated with the card. In my 2k deck, I have it set to auto play the audio on the back as well as writing out any new kanji manually a few times. Thus, it requires a lot more effort to engage with. Even so, I have found that my overall retention is *much* higher in the audio on the front cards, and it's a lot more comfortable to naturally learn vocabulary this way. I feel like this nearly emulates anime/VNs with JP subs, since it's good listening practice to hear it one time *and* visually see it and try and recall the meaning. Whereas with audio on the back, it kinda isolates the processes. ^please note, I'm doing it this way now, but please don't brush it off and attribute my better recollection simply to the fact that if I'm doing both decks at once, naturally the \"Easier\" method is going to yield \"better\" results. I have done days where I only did one deck to test this, and overall I still had much better results with the JP1K deck.\n\n\nOnce I finish the JP1K deck, I am going to go all in on the Core2.3k and I'm debating on transitioning to putting the audio on the front for this deck, but I'm afraid it will really hamper my reading ability. Or if I mostly wanna play VNs/watch anime/watch native japanese content, is this method okay? Afterall, being able to coherently engage with native content earlier in any context *could* be better right? Like I would be able to read more capably later anyways, as my brain would still pick up on important kanji and the like during my immersion? \n\nAlso, a lot of people learn kanji through RTK and simply remember just the meanings, but don't learn the readings until much much later anyways, so couldn't this also be a not too dissimilar way of layering the information differently so I can naturally acquire more? Kinda like how kids learn to speak before they learn to write? \n\n\nApologies for the wall of text, I'm just stricken with indecision as I've heard many negative things about sound on the front kanji, but none really that compare it to the perspective of watching anime/reading VNs.",

This isn't a huge issue, but it means a huge portion of the card is taken up by duplicative content - the expression is listed twice, and since having the whiteboard on for AnkiDroid means you can't scroll the card, it can cause problems with longer expressions.\n\nAs you can see from the images at the links, I can either have \n\n1. the Expression shown once with the cloze highlighted, \n\n2. [the Expression shown once with furigana](https://imgur.com/a/iOu2OHa), or \n\n3.

        "text": "A bit of a long story about my Journey. It may be helpful for someone just starting out, or anyone also interested in Korean. Cliff notes: I love Pimsleur and want another program like it as a supplement.\n\nI studied Korean off and on for a few years. Took several classes and used quite a few tutors. I also completed all 3 units of Pimsleur (they do not have 5 like Japanese, only 90 lessons total) and found it to be, by far, the most helpful learning tool for speaking/listening. \n\nEven after all of that, I'm no where near fluent and cannot understand native Korean media at all. I can however, carry very simple conversations in Korean with a decent amount of confidence. Koreans always appreciate it and it's a lot of fun. When I take Korean classes, my speaking is more confident than other students, unless they studied abroad in Korea. \n\nAnyways, I decided that getting beyond the upper beginner/low intermediate level in Korean was going to be nearly impossible and I decided to start spending time studying Japanese. I learned to read Hiragana and Katakana after maybe a month of practicing. I have little to no interest in learning Kanji. It just seems too difficult. The payoff for learning it is not great enough to justify all the time needed. I get much more satisfaction from having conversations with new people. Maybe I will memorize a few hundred Kanji someday, but it's not a priority for me now. \n\nI started using Pimsleur for Japanese from day 1 since I knew how helpful it was for my Korean. My initial thoughts were, \"wow, this is a lot easier than Korean\". I feel that speaking/listening to Japanese is much easier, although there are still some words that are difficult here and there. Japanese has more of a \"peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers\" kind of flow to it that takes some getting used to. Whereas Korean is much more slurred and not very clearly pronounced. \n\nI listen to 2 Japanese Pimsleur lessons about 5-6 days out of the week. I have to listen to almost every lesson twice. A few I have had to listen to 3 times if there were a lot of new words introduced. I also do the pronunciation practice and flash cards to help memorize the new words before each lesson. So, if I work really hard - I might get through 5 lessons in a week. If you already have some understanding of Japanese and know a lot of words, you'll progress faster. I'm 50 lessons in right now and intend to complete all 5 levels...maybe by early-mid summer if I'm lucky and stick to it. I find that I focus the best if I do the lessons while driving. I will sometimes drive for almost no reason other than to complete my daily lessons. It's too easy to get distracted at home.\n\nThe only problem is, there are still soooo many basic nouns and words that I do not know. It's also easy to forget material once you progress several lessons beyond it, because some phrases are never introduced again. I'd really like to use another program similar to Pimsleur to help fill in some of the gaps. Using another program will help me obtain new vocab and cement in the vocab and grammar I have already heard.\n\nI downloaded Duolingo and it seems like a complete joke. Apparently it works for some people, but I can't imagine how it would help with speaking / listening. Same with Rosetta Stone. If you want to practice reading/writing and taking multiple choice tests while staring at your phone, then go for these. If you want to converse with native speakers, I would not bother.\n\nAnyways, I am hoping there is another program similar to Pimsleur for Japanese. There is not for Korean, as language learning material is a bit less for that language (beyond beginner), but there are so many more Japanese learners, so I'm hoping there is another good conversational style listen and repeat program out there.",

        "text": "This is a very stupid question but, assuming that in Japanese language almost all foreigner words are written in katakana, why 'tobacco' is writen in hiragana? And why the first syllabe is 'ta' and not 'to'? English is not my native language, but I thought that the first syllabe of 'tobacco' sounds like 'to', not 'ta' as in Spanish.",

It's like people are so eager to tell you you're learning this language completely the wrong way and you need to follow their 'perfect' strategy that works. Or that you're wrong and don't know what you're talking about.\n\nReally, people who ask for advice really need encouragement and want to connect to people with similar interests more than the advice itself imo. They DON'T need to be made feel stupid for asking nor need to be patronized by some asshole. Just my opinion.",

Kanji to me is beautiful and I love stroke orders and stuff.\n\nThe past few days, I haven't been feeling so motivated to study. My anki cards frustrate me (Core2k) and I can't understand stuff in my grammar textbook (Cure Dolly) and I end up just revising some kana and kanji I learned initially. \n\nI am learning french currently and it's steating to come pretty naturally. I'm frustrated it's not the same for japanese. Sorry for the long rant, but is there any advice on how I can continue studying japanese?",

So if I was about to read the book, and get down thos words in kana, feels like that I'm wasting opportunity to learn those missing kanjis\n\nAnother option is to edit the words myself. For now, I don't mind doing it, but reallistically thinking on doing it for the entire book... seems really tiresome\n\nI thought jumping on Neverending Story, but I don't know if it will turn to be the same situation",
