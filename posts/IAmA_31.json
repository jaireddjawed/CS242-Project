        "text": "I’ve been working as a commercial diver for 13 years.  I’m hosting this AMA with some help from Atlas Obscura, who wrote about [life as a saturation diver](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/what-is-a-saturation-diver). I do construction and demolition work hundreds of feet deep in the ocean and spend weeks living in a pressurized environment—often a small, metal tube with about five other people. Over the years, I’ve been able to work for many different dive companies at locations all over the earth. \n\nDiving hundreds of feet below sea level involves breathing pressurized air and working at pressures of over 110 psi (nearly twice the pressure inside a bicycle tire). While underwater, we breathe in a mixture of helium, oxygen and nitrogen to prevent a condition called nitrogen narcosis, which mimics the feeling of being drunk. Gas from the compressed air we breathe dissolves into our blood and tissues, so when we resurface, we have to go extremely slowly, or we risk bubbles of gas forming inside our bodies, giving us a painful, possibly fatal condition known as “the bends.”\n\nMy deepest dive was a 30 day saturation campaign at 778 feet of sea water. We were installing 36 inch diameter pipe line tie in spool pieces. One bolt and two end nuts weighed in at 220 lbs. \n\nAfter a decade of working in the music industry as a musician and sound engineer I felt I needed a change. I graduated from Divers Institute of Technology Seattle WA in 2005 and moved to the heart of the US offshore oil field… Louisiana.  I was able to be part of a massive gulf wide clean up due to hurricane Katrina. The spectrum of work was vast, anything from small pipeline bypass projects to the  complete decommissioning of many toppled oil platforms. \n\nI have also been able to work for a few land based diving companies that took part in various civil engineering campaigns. Mostly installing up to date pumping stations for the local water districts of the southern US.\n\n - Global Diving and Marine Contractors\n - Epic Diving and Marine\n - Harkand\n - Ranger Offshore Inc.\n - American Underwater Services\n - Chapman Marine\n\nIf you’d like to donate to support my family and me through cancer treatment, here’s a link:\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/shannonhoveysbandp \n\nThis is a link to a saturation documentary\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbAxa-_3h6E \n\n\nDivers Institute link\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slq9lkHWs0I\n\nProof: https://twitter.com/atlasobscura/status/1030197554548539392\n\nEDIT: Hey everybody, I had a great time hanging out with you. Thanks for all the questions. Good luck to all of you planning on entering this  challenging field.\nPlease share my family’s go fund me link.  \nSigning off ",

I do multiple types of surgeries, both cancer removal and reconstructive including microsurgery. I’m also a scientist with a lab funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We study tumors and how they invade the immune system as well as evade chemotherapy. My main focus with patients is their survival and quality of life.\n \nKatie Stubblefield was only 18 when she attempted to take her life. She waited three years for a new face and at 21, she became the youngest person in the U.S. to receive a full face transplant. The still experimental procedure took 31 hours for myself and a team of doctors to complete. I was the first clinic doctor to see Katie and I organized a multidisciplinary team of 15 specialists to address all her issues, from endocrinology to psychiatry.

        "text": "Hi Reddit, we just got back from from the [fifth annual JuliaCon](http://juliacon.org/2018/) conference (in London this year), where after nine years of work, we, 300 people in the audience and 150 on the live stream^(1) released version 1.0 of the [julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).\n\nFor me personally, this AmA is coming full circle. I first learned about Julia in 2012 from [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/pv3k9/why_we_created_julia_a_new_programming_language/) on /r/programming. You can read all about what’s new in 1.0 in our [release blog post](https://julialang.org/blog/2018/08/one-point-zero), but I think the quoted paragraph from the original post captures the “Why?” well:\n\n&gt;We want a language that’s open source, with a liberal license. We want the speed of C with the dynamism of Ruby. We want a language that’s homoiconic, with true macros like Lisp, but with obvious, familiar mathematical notation like Matlab. We want something as usable for general programming as Python, as easy for statistics as R, as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for linear algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell. Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious hackers happy. We want it interactive and we want it compiled.\n\nAnswering your questions today will be Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Alan Edelman, Viral Shah, Keno Fischer (short bios below), as well as a few other members of the julia community who've found their way to this thread.\n\n|/u/JeffBezanson|Jeff is a programming languages enthusiast, and has been focused on julia’s subtyping, dispatch, and type inference systems. Getting Jeff to finish his PhD at MIT (about Julia) was Julia issue #8839, a fix for which shipped with Julia 0.4 in 2015. He met Viral and Alan at Alan’s last startup, Interactive Supercomputing. Jeff is a prolific violin player.|\n|:-|:-|\n|/u/StefanKarpinski|Stefan studied Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara, applying mathematical techniques to the analysis of computer network traffic. While there, he and co-creator Viral Shah were both avid ultimate frisbee players and spent many hours on the field together. Stefan is the author of large parts of the Julia standard library and the primary designer of each of the three iterations of Pkg, the Julia package manager.|\n|/u/AlanEdelman|Alan’s day job is Professor of Mathematics and member Computer Science &amp; AI Lab at MIT.  He is the chief scientist at Julia Computing and loves explaining not only what is Julia, but why Julia can look so simple and yet be so special.|\n|/u/ViralBShah|Viral finished his PhD in Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara in 2007, but then moved back to India in 2009 (while also starting to work on Julia) to work with Nandan Nilekani on the Aadhaar project for the Government of India. He has co-authored the book Rebooting India about this experience.|\n|/u/loladiro (Keno Fischer)|Keno started working on Julia while he was an exchange student at a small high school on the eastern shore of Maryland. While continuing to work on Julia, he attended Harvard University, obtaining a Master’s degree in Physics. He is the author of key parts of the Julia compiler and a number of popular Julia packages. Keno enjoys ballroom and latin social dancing.|\n\nProof: [https://twitter.com/KenoFischer/status/1029380338609520640](https://twitter.com/KenoFischer/status/1029380338609520640)\n\n^(1) Live stream recording here: [https://youtu.be/1jN5wKvN-Uk?t=1h3m45s](https://youtu.be/1jN5wKvN-Uk?t=1h3m45s) \\- Apologies for the shaking.

In [2016, AL-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama%27s_4th_congressional_district) voted for Trump by over 80% -- the highest percentage in the country. My opponent, Robert Aderholt, ran unopposed in 3 out of the last 4 elections. Democracy only works if voters have a choice. I intend to give them one. We’re [the epicenter of the opioid crisis](https://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2018/08/alabamas_opioid_crisis_wont_be.html) (166 prescriptions/100 people), but Aderholt is busy taking money from Pharma while promising that Trump’s economic policy will “fix it.” His most recent legislation would[ make it harder for same-sex couples to adopt](https://www.metro.us/news/politics/robert-aderholt-amendment-license-to-discriminate-lgbtq), which both discriminates against the LGBT community AND keeps children from finding safe and loving homes. The people of Alabama deserve a congressman who will work for **people,** not lobbyists and corporations.\n\nMy priorities:\n\n* Affordable healthcare\n* Strong and safe public schools (including tuition-free community college)\n* Criminal justice reform\n* Voting rights protection\n* Job creation via infrastructure investment\n\nAsk me about my positions, the Trump-Auman voters I meet every day, and/or my love for Star Trek.  I’ll be here taking questions all morning.

In fact, our goal is not only to physically construct whatever is in your head, but to help children put down their tablets and tap into their innate, inner creativity. There are links at the bottom of this post where you can find ALL our work.\n\nI owned a landscaping business for \\~9 years when I decided to go out and build a playhouse for my kids. One of my clients saw it and decided that he needed one for his yard, which turned into another client’s yard, then another, and another. Eventually, I sold my landscaping business to pursue whimsical playhouse building full-time.  \n\nThen we exploded. \n\nWe had a TV show contract within a year and travelled all over North America installing playhouses for legends like Steph Curry (NBA MVP), personal mentors and heroes like my parents, and TV stars like Alana De La Garza (CSI/Law and Order).\n\nWe’ve had many bumps and bruises along the way, but our company has grown to about 10 full-time employees. As an entrepreneurial venture, we’ve seen every roadblock imaginable, including all the hassles of international business (we’ve even shipped structures to China!)\n\nMyself and my speedy-typing assistant Brady (a business student/intern from the University of Lethbridge - Dhillon School of Business) are here to answer all your questions for at least the next 3 hours. Seriously, ask me anything!\n\nHere is an imgur gallery of one of our more popular playhouses, the Rapunzel: [https://imgur.com/gallery/bhTpL](https://imgur.com/gallery/bhTpL)\n\nHere are links to our social media accounts / web gallery with tons of pictures: \n\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/charmedplayhouses/](https://www.facebook.com/charmedplayhouses/) \n\nInstagram: [https://www.instagram.com/charmedplayhouses/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/charmedplayhouses/?hl=en) \n\nWebsite Gallery: [http://charmedplayhouses.ca/about-us/portfolio-gallery/](http://charmedplayhouses.ca/about-us/portfolio-gallery/) \n\nImgur: [https://imgur.com/user/Charmedplayhouses/submitted](https://imgur.com/user/Charmedplayhouses/submitted)  ",

        "text": "Both of my parents and my relatives dating back hundreds of years were Amsih. After my family left the Amish church, I became the first person in my family to go to college to try something other than working on a farm. After college I got a job working on capital hill. After a few years riding a desk in an office, I realized working with my hands as my family had done before me was far more rewarding. I quit my good paying job and dove into the leather craft headfirst. While not all of my family approves of the internet, they are happy I'm using it to keep the tradition alive. I'd love to answer your questions about Amish or leather working. \n\nProof: https://www.blackbearleather.com/pages/the-black-bear-name \"blackbearleather. 8/14/18 Reddit: IAMA\" Inserted underneath my photo 'John Michael Glick'.",
