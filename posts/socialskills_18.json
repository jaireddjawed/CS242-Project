I have been in college for almost five years and up to this point, I'm having a lot of trouble making friends and finding people who genuinely want to get to know and interact with me for long-term. As of right now, I currently know around 7 people who I consistently talk to but they're mostly acquaintances from classes rather than friends. Most friends I have now which is not many, are friends I maintained from high school. I'm working on making new connections during the time I have left here but I am not very confident about it. I used to have more genuine friends at school but they randomly drifted away.\n\nI have been thinking a lot about what my life will look like after college, and it's been frightening. Growing up, I have always been the shy and quiet guy and never had a lot of genuine friends. I'm not in touch or connected with a lot of people from my hometown that I will go back to after college. I have heard a lot about how much harder it is to make new friends and connections after college. In college, it's considered much easier for a lot of people, because you often have people around you and there are a ton of opportunities. I don't think it's the same case after when you go into the real world and focus on a career. Most friends or acquaintances you meet in college will inevitably drift away too just like high school.\n\nI just want to hear experiences from people who have already graduated. How hard is it for you to meet and make new friends after school?",

        "text": "Currently a sophomore in highschool and had a very rough start to the year. This is my first year in a in person school in 3 years; went online half way through 7th grade and all of 8th grade for 9th grade I opted to take an online course because my social anxiety was really bad and I couldn't handle going out for anything other than doctors appointments; and even that was a struggle for me.\n\nI joined late in my school year by around 3 weeks; I was so anxious I couldn't talk to anyone at all not even my teachers. I couldn't do simple things like getting up to ask a question, asking a peer for notes I missed, or even just emailing my teachers for clarification on things. \n\nI'm a lot better now but, I'm still struggling and even after all my improvements I don't feel like it's enough. I can comfortablely talk to my teachers and ask questions, I can ask for directions, and notes sometimes. That being said I still can't talk to people really. I still struggle to actually initiate conversations and when someone does talk to me I sometimes shutdown and can't really form a coherent sentence. Which is still better than last semester as I can talk mostly okay but, only when spoken to.\n\nI also struggle just being alone in public. I don't really like going out and I don't have any friends so I'm only ever out really when I occasionally go shopping with a parent and even then I can't really wonder on my own. I.e mom goes to the bathroom and I stand awkwardly and start panicking. Also can't ask employees for help on my own.\n\nSo despite being better than I used to be I'm still a wreck and want to get a lot better by the time I'm in college since I plan on moving and will obviously have to be independent. I also really want to be more social and actually make friends when I'm in college. \n\nI'm also currently only 15 so I'm hoping when I get my license I'll be able to practice going out more but till then I'm stuck pretty much exclusively at school.\n\nAny advice? Main struggle I have at the moment is just being able to talk to people no matter how many times I feel like my social anxiety has improved it never seems to improve in that area.\n\n(Some notes can't join a club there's barley any + the ones already there are very small and cliquey)",

H is very intelligent, she aces all subjects every single semester, just straight A's. When we are asked about our personal opinions in a discussion or anything, she always refers to tons of books she reads about almost everything. When we're asked a question, she's always the one who's on point saying exactly what the teacher was thinking about. So she's not easy to befriend, she only chooses people who are either exactly or closely like her. We agree on a lot of things but I have extreme social anxiety that makes me look like Patrick from SpongeBob type of dumb even tho I'm absolutely the opposite.\n\n\n\nAnother problem is that my current friend, who we will name Y, hates H. Y is a great open minded friend who likes discussions about everything and anything, has great opinions and always wants to be better. Y thinks that H is heartless and rude for her seriousness to the point of unconsciously offending others sometimes and I kinda agree. So i'm afraid that if I try to befriend H, Y won't want to be my friend anymore and might get offended if I tell her why I want to befriend H.\n\n\n\nI want to be friends with both. How do I make H think of me as a friend? And how do I explain myself to Y or at least make her accept H so she won't be mad when I try to befriend H? \n\n\n\nPs: I'm autistic and I lack some social skills so I don't want to go through lobes of socialization efforts cause I will probably fail. \n\n\nThank you ❤️",

I have left all my old friends behind and have been living on my own ever since. \n\nI'm a very social person, so making friends isn't hard for me, but keeping them around has always been an issue. For a few months now, I have been ending things with a couple of my friends. My reasoning, the friendship is getting one-sided. The start of a friendship is always amazing, but slowly things die down. Some of my friends blamed it on me. I love to give, and I'm always giving to the friendship, BUT I was told by some of my friends that I shouldn't expect to get as much as I give, because I'm simply giving too much. I always do little things like carry a box of tissues with me because my friends are messy eaters. Another incident was when one of my friends asked me for some pandols because he was having a headache. I didn't have any at the time, but when I was on my way home, I visited the pharmacy and bought some pandols and kept them in my uni bag in case any of my friends ever needed them again. I do little things like those all the time, and it's very draining. No one is forcing me to do it, but isn't that what friends are supposed to do??? \n\n\n\nRight now, I'm about to end things with my best friend. She has been busy these past few months, and we haven't had an actual chat in almost 3 months. I text her in the morning, but she gets back to me at 11 pm when I'm about to go to bed. So basically, I'll text her goodnight, and she will answer at 11 with \"hi, I miss you, and goodnight.\" Again, she said that she is very busy, but you are supposed to at least free some time for me.\n\n\n Am I being unreasonable??? Am I expecting too much from her??? Why does it feel like all my friendships have become one-sided???",

        "text": "Feel free to tell me I’m wrong, but I’m feeling pretty bad about this situation and need outside perspectives. I’m purposefully leaving gender out of this, so the names don’t mean anything.\n\nI’m living with two of my closest friends, let’s call them Avery and Blair, plus a fourth roommate, Cato. I became friends with Avery and Blair in mid high school while they went waay back. I always understood in the back of my mind that I’d never be as big of a priority to them, but I’d still like to think I at least got pretty close to Blair due to us sharing many interests. Cato came along later, and I was able to befriend them too.\n\nThe four of us decided it would be nice to live together in college, so we did. Things were pretty good for a year and we were all pretty tight, until Cato talked to Avery about some problems they were having with them. After that, nothing was ever really resolved and Cato just withdrew while Avery became anxious and often turned to Blair for support. I tried my best to mediate between Avery and Cato while staying neutral but that probably backfired.\n\nThe dynamic in our group shifted so fast. Blair eventually took Avery’s side since they both had their qualms about Cato, and I had my reservations about Cato as well, but tried to keep an open mind, since with the inciting incident, both parties were at fault. However, Blair and Avery turned into a kind of “anti-Cato club,” and I felt kind of stuck in the middle since I wasn’t quite ready to villainize Cato. \n\nThen, not long after, Avery experienced a significant loss of a loved one. Their need for support from Blair increased a lot, with good reason, and Blair was a very good friend to them. I also tried my best to support Avery, but totally understood that Blair was their first choice for comfort. This all happened during a break from school, but when we all returned, the dynamic was more drastically different.\n\nAvery and Blair spend almost all day, every day, together. Blair signed up for a class with Avery that takes place twice a week, and they get lunch together once or twice a week. Blair drives Avery to work. When they get home, they are still joined at the hip. This entire semester, I have never seen either one living their own life- all of their hobbies have converged, and after having class/getting lunch, they will come home and keep hanging out from 3 pm till 3-5 am. They are only apart when they sleep. Call me jealous or petty, but I feel like even securely attached friends who live together do not spend 17+ hours with each other on the daily. Not to mention, with the exile of Cato, over the course of a year, their social circle has shrunk from a large club, to 4 or so close friends, to just me, and even I feel like I’m slowly being pushed out. They never talk favorably about their “mutual friends” and will see them sometimes upon request, but talk shit the second they get home. Blair and I used to game, go to the gym, etc. on a fairly regular basis but that barely happens anymore and only happens when Avery isn’t home. Everything we’ve done together this semester has been from my request.\n\nThis left me in a weird spot because now I feel like I’m constantly third wheeling Blair and Avery. It just feels like Blair and Avery against the world now, and I’m about to become part of the world considering most of their effort goes into hanging out with each other at this point. Anyone experience third wheeling a codependent friendship? What did you do about it? Also feel free to tell me that I’m delusional and that they have a perfectly healthy friendship and that I need to stop being jealous, because that’s also an option haha\n\nTL;DR: A series of events have brought two of my closest friends together to the point of disregarding most other things and people, and I’m afraid of losing them.",

The last time I saw them they were shitting on some girl for feeling uncomfortable around max and thus they dropped her. Made me feel a bit ew as they never elaborated on why she was uncomfortable around him and thus I just decided to keep away and stay civil \n\nAnyway it’s become a thing now where anytime I see one of them and try to do a brief “hey” walk away they’ll make it a point to stop me and mention how they’re all meeting up and it’s good to see the gang etc etc and I didn’t think much of it until one day one of them asked me to drop something off in the common room and they were all there. Once again i wanted to keep it brief but one of them interrupts with “we have others coming here so it’s best you leave now” while the others looked at me with pity ?! \nWhich made me think … this whole time did they think they were leaving me out on purpose or something ? Like I really wanted them to invite me ? There’s also other things like they have a group chat and it’ll be a point to mention how I’m not in it or “you wouldn’t understand you’re not in the gc” \n\nI’m very very introverted and prefer being alone I have 3 quality friends and I’m pretty happy sticking with that.

This makes me feel like they're friendships out of convenience \n2) I am very happy to come and help people out when they ask me to and I'm free. There's been little response when I am in need of someone. This could be coincidence, you never know. \n3) and all those nice extra things I do for people, random small gifts (like bringing a coffee when we meet up), planning excursions, even simply arranging calls. It feels very one-sided\n\nI have tried to set boundaries recently, not putting more effort into a friendship than I feel is coming back but this has left me very unhappy too. I don't know if I'm overthinking. I don't know how to form better friendships if I am not.

        "text": "How to break into an established friend group? \n\nA very close friend introduced me to his core friend group which had known each other for &gt; 10 years since middle school. I decided that I wanted to break into this friend group in my city. \n\n* **Use a core member of the group as a referral to the main group.** It always helps to get an introduction via a main friend of the group. The goal was to be naturally considered one of the friend groups and to be invited to hangouts. The mutual friend later changed cities and came back occasionally, which made navigating this easier for me because I did not have to go through him to hang out with them. I no longer had to rely on him to invite me to socials and could form direct bonds with other group members. \n* **Target some group members for friendship.** Next, I became friends with one of the group members that were open to starting new friendships and individually invited him out to do stuff - like bouldering and going to a museum. This friend also added me to their group chat, which was a crucial step - this does not happen in all cases. I carefully added to the banter of the gc but never disturbed it too much. \n* **Understand the group dynamic and fit in.** Given my past experiences, I navigated the dynamic very closely, knowing that I did not want to self-sabotage. This could include alienating my mutual friend, although I must admit that he was largely happy that all of us did get along. I also did not complain when the group was either late or missed a hangout, knowing that that is just how they are. Do not say No to your first invites. \n* **Give it time.** Gradually, our bonds and shared experiences depended. This group member friend was also my clutch to be invited to other hangouts/confirm when things are happening and eventually, people started getting to know me as a friend. I also started getting more comfortable calling some of the individual members every now and then to my place. \n* **Be willing to ignore a few things.** Overall, I positioned myself to ensure I never come across as threatening and fit in the main group dynamic smoothly. Whenever the mutual friend was in town, I did not take the lead in the gc to avoid alienating him. I also ignored it if I was not invited to a hangout.  Slowly, the friend group started seeing me as a member of the group, even if not as a core member. Remember that when you are trying to break into a friend group and you commit a blunder, they will prioritize longstanding friendships over you.\n\nI hope this helps anyone trying to break into new friend groups. It can be hard, especially as you grow older but with tact and precision, you can make it. Good luck!",

I am not 100% sure if it’s just a period of selfishness or my upbringing (selfish mom) because at 17 I was diagnosed with permanent and progressive hearing loss in which I’ll eventually be deaf, a lot of my social skills I threw out the window and I became very rejecting and selfish instead of the opposite. But now since I have gone through most of the steps to not be thinking about how I’ll be dead most of the damn day. Socializing is very difficult. I no longer want to count people out or focus on myself this much to the point where the topic of most convo is myself. It’s secluding me in ways that make me very very lonely.",

Hoping for some positive feedback on this after yall readdit 😉\n\nSo here I am, 31 year old male and still find it hard to deal with rejection. I am introverted with terrible, (although improving) social skills. As you can probably guess, I am a boring texter. As a result, i get close to zero dates. While I am working on these skills, it's still a very painful process as texting is more of a drawn out rejection. I know it's not the best strategy to keep texting them if they don't reply but sometimes it's too hard to resist the urge and when I do it, it makes me feel worse. My question is, how do you deal with rejection  in a healthy way?",

I recently quit my job as a barista to work as a pharmacy tech. My loneliness often causes me to read too much into things.\n\nMy boss/supervisor, a PharmD, is 51M, but *hot* for his age (please excuse my juvenile-sounding language). Although he is a trustworthy man and good at his work, my coworkers describe him as stern, unfriendly, and a bit cold. He seems to have a soft for me, though. He is married, and his wife is in her late 40s. They have never had children.\n\nHe has treated me with such kindness, unlike most human beings I have met in my life. Maybe I am even his favorite. That means a lot to me because I have never been ANYONE's favorite. Not my parents, not my teachers or sports coaches, and definitely not my peers.\n\nHere are some things my handsome boss has done the past few months:\n\n\\-He touches the small of my back in my passing (but maybe that is just because I'm clumsy and bump into shelves a lot?)\n\n\\-He would grab my arm and say \"good job today\"\n\n\\-He insists I call him by his first name. Most of my young coworkers around my age call him \"Mr.\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\"\n\n\\-One time he offered me a ride home from work, and sat next to me in the car while his wife drove. I rested my head on his shoulder, and he put his arm around me.\n\n\\-On the same ride, I told him I will miss him the week I go visit Delaware, and he said, \"come to my house tomorrow. I can cook for you.\" (Mind you, his wife was in the car too, and seemed really enthusiastic and supportive of the idea).\n\n\\-I was wearing a floral high-cut shirt underneath my scrubs and it showed, and he said \"I like your shirt\"\n\nI am 25. I am old enough to detect if something seems out of the norm, but also tend to read too much into things?\n\nTl;Dr: I would like to ask what my boss's intentions seem to be.\n\nIs he just a really kind man? Does he have paternal feelings towards me since he never had children? Is it something else entirely?\n\nEdit: I should probably also add that NONE of this made me uncomfortable. In fact, I look forward to spending time with him. I am just curious about what his intentions are.",

I'm quite a friendly person, and I'm a good listener. I ask questions and am genuinely interested in making the other person feel better. And I make sure I express my feelings. But somehow I'm unable to form a connection once the ice breaking part of it gets over. Like, say, when I'm in a group, people stop making eye contact with me after a while. When I'm texting, people stop responding after a point. Sometimes, when I send genuine, heartfelt messages to people, I'm put on \"seen\". Sometimes, old friends literally beg me to meet them, and the day after I meet them, they sort of go cold on me. \n\n\nTo give you the surrounding context, I have a decent sense of humor, and am well-read. I'm not too extroverted or introverted. My language is fluent. I used to be a people pleaser in my childhood, but I worked hard to get out of that pattern about 6-7 years ago. I had a lot of anxiety in my childhood, but I'm a lot more relaxed now. \n\nI've been breaking my head about this for a long time, and I'm unable to understand what the issue could be. Please help me try and understand this. I know it's too much to ask, but maybe you could ask me questions so I can explore things I haven't explored before...\n\nThanks in advance! ❤️",

The chair was nowhere near her and I walked away after. She called the police and said she feared for her life so they arrested me for domestic disturbance of peace. I also had some toxic friends that I cut off because they used to talk about me behind my back to each other. I tried to confide in one of my other friends about being talked about, hoping she would understand, but she went and told the rest of them what I said and now they have a smear campaign going on me. They found my old reddit with a lot of embarrassing stuff and they're using that against me and they're going around telling women that I'm abusive and a woman beater with anger issues showing them my mugshot. We all used to dance together so we're in the same community and my reputation feels ruined and I'm working on finding new hobbies/friends. Is there any action I can take or anything I can do to stop worrying so much?",

I struck gold recently, figuring out that there’s a group of metalheads who are also into punk, but the problem is, I have no idea how to approach people. Every time I’ve ever made a friend, I was the friend being made. I’ve never asked somebody to be my friend, so I have no idea how to do it without seeming weird. I’m also a male, and the metalheads are all women, so it might be even more awkward to approach them. What should I do?",

Or, accepting to split the bill even after saying I don't want to because they would buy more and I'm just too awkward to say no. :') or how once they said they would wait for me after class and after roughly ten mins, they messaged me that they felt impatient and walked away. That was when I realized it hurt a lot and I've just been reflecting a lot! \n\nThey are really sweet and are there when I need them (I do realize instead of comforting me when I ask for it, they often make it about themselves). \n\nI try to also initiate conversations about what I've been learning in class and more often than not it's shot down aaaaa it's just frustrating because I'm tired of feeling left out  :( after ditching me basically, I let them know it hurt my feelings and they said they didn't mean to and quickly changed the subject shdjkffk not sure how to go about this or if I should try to meet new people?
