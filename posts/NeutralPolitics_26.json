Manafort [was then-candidate Trump's campaign chairman in the summer of 2016.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/paul-manafort-indicted.html?_r=0)  Gates was [his close aide and protege.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/us/politics/rick-gates-russia.html)\n\nAlso today, [a guilty plea](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4163402/Papadopoulos-Statement-Offense.pdf) by George Papadopoulos for lying to the FBI was revealed.  Mr. Papadopoulos was a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign.   [He was arrested in July 2017 and this case had been under seal from then until today.](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4163479/7-28-17-Motion-to-Seal-Papadopoulos.pdf)\n\nWhat new facts did we learn from these documents today?  The Manafort/Gates indictment is an allegation yet to be proven by the government.  The factual statements in the Papadopoulos plea however are admitted as true by Mr. Papadopoulos.\n\nAre there any totally new revelations in this?  Prior known actions where more detail has been added?\n\n**Edit 4:23 PM EST:** Since posting this, an additional document of interest has become available.  That is a [court opinion and order](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/redacted_unsealed_opinion_20171030.pdf) requiring the attorney for Manafort and Gates to testify to certain matters around their statements to the government concerning foreign agent registration.\n\n---\n\nMod footnote: I am submitting this on behalf of the mod team because we've had a ton of interest about this subject, and it's a tricky one to craft a rules-compliant post on. We will be very strictly moderating the comments here, especially concerning not allowing unsourced or unsubstantiated speculation.\n",

The decentralized nature of [Al-Qaeda] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda) required a decentralized AUMF, to combat those responsible for the attacks on 9/11 and any ‘associated forces’.  Since then, the US has essentially been engaged in a [low-intensity global war on terror] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror) that has targeted al-Qa’ida, the Taliban, al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen; and individuals who are part of al-Qa’ida in Somalia and Libya. In addition, we have conducted military operations under the 2001 AUMF against the Nusrah Front and, specifically, those members of al-Qa’ida referred to as the Khorasan Group in Syria. We have also resumed such operations against the group we fought in Iraq when it was known as al-Qa’ida in Iraq, [which is now known as ISIL] (https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Article/606662/).  \n\n\nLeaders of [Al-Mourabitoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mourabitoun_(militant_group\\)), Sahraoui and Belmokhtar, have produced conflicting messages of the group’s allegiance, but ISIL formally accepted a pledge of allegiance from Sahraoui in October 2016.  This makes them an associated force of an associated force of Al-Qaeda.  \n\n\nDoes the 2001 AUMF apply to Al-Mouribatoun?  Does the recent [ambush] (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/africa/u-s-now-moving-toward-armed-drones-lethal-force-niger-n814341) of U.S. military in Niger affect that?

        "text": "There has been [substantial controversy](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/24/559864118/tiny-montana-firm-gets-300-million-contract-to-help-restore-power-in-puerto-rico) about the awarding of a $300 million contract by PREPA, the [Puerto Rican power authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Electric_Power_Authority) to a company called Whitefish Energy, which apparently had only two employees and $1 million in annual revenue prior to the contract.\n\nYesterday a purported copy of the PREPA/Whitefish contract was posted online.  \n\n**Edit: Apparently the copy of the contract may contain personal information of some of the signatories.  I've pulled the link though the relevant excerpt can be found [here](https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/923741769719779328)**\n\nIs this contract unusual in form?  Are there provisions which are atypical or prohibited in government contracts.  In particular I wonder about Article 59 of the contract, which states:\n\n&gt;The Contractor agrees to provide PREPA, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the FEMA administrator, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the Contractor which are directly pertinent to this Contract for the purposes of making audits, examination, excerpts, and transctipstions, during the Contractor's performance of the contract and for up to three (3) years after Contractor's receipt of final payment under the Contract. **In no event shall PREPA, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the FEMA administrator, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives have the right to audit or review the cost and profit elements of the labor rates specified herein.**\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nIs there precedent for a contractor like Whitefish getting a contract like this?  If so, is it a good precedent or bad precedent?\n\nIs the contract typical in form and content for these sort of contracts?  If not, how serious are the deviations?  Is the 'no audit' provision in respect to labor rates normal?",
