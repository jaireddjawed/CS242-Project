        "text": "This is a story about Basic.\n\nBasic came to work in the accounting department at a law firm after her mother died. My boss was a family friend of hers and wanted to help Basic out. She was very young and right away, a lot of people in the department who didn’t like how she got the job took to making fun of her and making sure she never advanced. I was still starting out in this firm and department (but no stranger to law firm life) and wanted to help her out as much as I could. I taught her some basic software skills and tricks. She was very eager to learn though not very bright. \n\nYears pass and she has not gotten a raise of any sort since joining on and the department seems to delight in this. I jump on an offer to join another department as a supervisor and I get to choose who gets to come with me. I choose Basic – the department is to be designed around a workflow I had created and she had been trained extensively on it. \n\nUpon our first day of setting up in our new office, it is explained that administratively, I am not her direct supervisor (time off, sick days, payroll, etc). I am, however, supervisory to the workflow of the department which includes her participation in it. She takes this to mean that I am not her supervisor, period, and she gleefully tells me this as someone comes by to congratulate us. I bring up that, yes, that is true for the administrative side and it falls on deaf ears. I confirm with our boss of the situation as I understood it, she agrees.  I don’t make a big deal of it because we have time to work on it if it ever comes to that.\n\nWe press on. Almost a year working together and it’s okay. Not great but the work is getting done. I continue to defend Basic to the old department who is still eager for her to fail.\n\nOne day, Basic has exciting news. She has landed a new job at a different firm. I am sad that she didn’t come to me for a reference but am very excited for her. Basic says for me not to tell anyone as she wants to share the news herself.\n\nThere is one problem: she just told her supervisor that she’s leaving. I know that our boss will dismiss her immediately (though she dismisses people with two weeks pay). We have a backlog of work I can’t do alone. And Basic deserves her victory lap. I can either ignore protocol and let a lot of speculation happen about her sudden departure or do the job I was hired to do and make sure Basic has that victory lap.\n\nI leave our office a few minutes later to tell my boss what is going on. Unfortunately, another supervisor and my boss’s assistant is there. I ask them if I can have a few minutes alone and after confirming it isn’t personal, they say they will keep it confidential and I close the door and explain the situation. My boss of course wants her gone immediately. Get her to agree to let her stay a week (with one weeks pay) and again ask the two others who wouldn’t leave to keep this confidential.\n\nBy the time I get back to my office, someone has texted Basic, congratulating her on her new job.  The texter had just received a text from someone who was in that room. This is less than a minute after I leave. Basic slams our office door. She begins to scream at me - this was her news to tell.\n\nI try to tell her that I was doing my job and once again said, “You’re not a real supervisor!”\n\nBasic continues to yell at me until she decides she needs some air. Basic points a fan on me, puts it on full blast (to shame me?) and screams, “This is not over!” and leaves – slamming the door again.\n\nI move the fan, go to my computer HR has sent me an email copying my boss to go over what I had said. I updated them with what was going on and they ask me if I still want Basic there for another week – it’s my call as supervisor.\n\nBasic comes back, slams the door again, sees that I turned off the fan and puts it back on me and begins to leave a voicemail to HR to see if she can sit somewhere else for the remainder of her time there.\n\nI email back that I would like her to be terminated today.\n\nBasic is then called to my boss’s office. When she returns, she is very apologetic. I learn later that my boss has said that she hasn’t decided whether or not to let her go today based on her actions and it will be based on my recommendation as her supervisor. I say that I am going to lunch.\n\nBy the time I get back, she’s gone. \n\nIt’s bittersweet as the department where we came from? Where so many had made fun of her, harassed her, and made sure she never got a raise? Now they began to say how they always thought she was so kind and I was so mean to her and was an absolute bitch.\n\nTL/dr: Took on a picked on girl at work, said I wasn’t her real supervisor, found out the hard way that I was.\n\n\n",

        "text": "So I work as a doorman (bouncer) in sunny old England. This is just money on the side. I make far more money training people. I do this because I have nothing better to do and it pays my rent. I'm blessed with the ability to walk away at any time so I honestly don't give a crap about club politics and the drama that goes on, all I'm concerned with is making sure everyone has a good time and no trouble comes through my door... This story happened last Friday. \n\nI was meant to be at a venue from 8:30 pm until 3am, the owner of this venue is your typical greasy nightclub owner putting his own greed above anything. Entry fees change depending if he gets a kiss on the cheek by the girls and he always tries skirting around letting underage girls in as well, he's the type of guy that is always bragging about what watch he bought that week and his name is Carlos. \n\nCarlos is infamous for charging doormen for water during their shifts. Personally I do not like this man so I don't support him, I was only there to cover for a mate so he could go to a stag night. \n\nI arrived at 8:30 pm, five minutes late, as I stopped to go buy an energy drink. There was no one on site besides Carlos, in fact it doesn't get busy until at least 11, a fact we both know. Carlos was chatting with what appeared to be a new bargirl. He impatiently started tapping his watch, puffed his chest out and stated. \n\nCarlos: \"You're late, you're paid to be here from 8:30 until 3.\"\n\nBackstory: It's meant to close at 3 but after getting everyone out and bringing in the table and chairs from the smoking area you don't usually finish until at least half past which you're not getting paid for. The venue can close at 4 if it's agreed on before hand.\n\nHe was obviously showing off to the new girl but I was in a mischievous mood so I let this slide. \n\nMe: \"Yes mate you're right I'll keep an eye on the time in future, when's the other guy getting here?\" \n\nBackstory: This is a 2 man venue, there needs to be a minimum of 2 door staff that night; it's part of his licence agreement. He's not allowed to operate without this\n\nCarlos: \"he'll be here at 11\"\n\nAnd he walked back in, completely unaware of just how fucked he really was. \n\nCome 11 the other guy didn't turn up and I basically get told to cope on my own. Fun fun fun. \n\nIt gets to 2:30 am and the other places are starting to kick out and we're getting packed. Carlos is upfront collecting the entrance fees and he's making a killing. We see a massive group heading our way, 2 venues have closed for the night so about 40 people are heading our way and seeing as the only other venue that's open has a £10 entrance fee and he's charging £5 you can bet most people are coming here. You could see the pound signs in his eyes. \n\nWe're coming up to 3am now and I decided to have a little chat with Carlos.\n\nMe: \"Busy tonight\"\nCarlos: \"yeah we're going to close at 4\"\nMe: \"cool, when is the other guy getting here?\"\n\nCarlos looks a bit bewildered at this.\n\nCarlos: \"the other guy?\"\nMe: \"... I finish at 3 remember\"\n\nRealisation dawns upon his face... He knows.\n\nCue the frantic negotiations, the pleas for a favour, all which are falling on deaf ears. \n\nHe has 2 choices \n\n 1. remain open and violate his licence\n\n 2. tell the 40 something people he just charged the entrance fee to they have to leave in less than a few minutes time. \n\nMy phone alarm goes off. I hand Carlos my radio, walk to the the kebab shop, buy some chips, then head across the road to watch what happens. \n\nA few minutes later the lights come on and I watch as the drunkards start shouting in his face. He looks panicked and afraid as he started handing out five pound notes to everyone. I could tell there was more than 40 and I would bet a few people went more than once. All the while he kept glancing at me across the road eating my chips.\n\n\n\nEdit: for the self confessed grammar nazis who have requested I add more periods and commas here you go. \n\n...........,,,,,,,,,,, \n\n\n\n**Update:** Turns out this caused more of a problem than I first thought. After I finished my chips and left he lost complete control of the crowd he basically just gave away £300. There was no first aider on site after I left and everyone just walked out with their glasses which is specifically not allowed in his license agreement. So he's in trouble with licensing after this his 4 am closing time might be revoked. Also, he's actually hiring a manager now rather than being there all night so it's really a win-win for everyone involved... Except for Carlos.\n\n\nGlad you enjoyed this i've got a lot more I can post so watch out. ",

        "text": "Someone suggested this might fit here: \n\nAbout 9 years ago I had been doing some online dating on Plenty of Fish. I agreed to meet up with this guy at a bar where a band was playing. He got me a couple of drinks and we both went home. I wasn’t coming onto him at all and I don’t think we even hugged goodbye. He spent the whole night talking about himself and I just wasn’t into it.\n\nHe later asked me to go out again and I declined. He insisted he needed to know why. I simply told him I didn’t think we were compatible and I wasn’t interested. He kept pushing and pushing and I was irritated so I told him he talked about himself too much and he didn’t seem very interested in me. He then told me because of this he expected me to pay him back for the two drinks he bought me that night. I stopped talking to him at that point and blocked his number.\n\nThe next day I was really pissed off about his comment and his bad attitude so I decided I would pay him back after all. When we went on the date I met him at his place and he drove us to the bar in his Jeep TJ which he had already taken the top off for the season. So I went to the bank and purchased 800 pennies and my friend and I dumped them all in his car and spread them out real good. I also left a note saying “I hope this covers those two drinks!”\n\nA few weeks later I received an email from the Heart and Stroke Foundation thanking me for my donation of $6.72. That means there were still a whopping 128 pennies in his car somewhere, and every time he found another (for years I’m sure), he thought of me.",

        "text": "First off, I have been reading Malicious Compliance for a few months and finally decided to get an account to post.\n\nA few years ago, as a university student I lived in the dorms. This particular dorm had two people per dorm room, which consisted of two beds, two desks, and two wardrobes with not much else. I was late getting my application submitted to the dorm and was therefore stuck with a roommate, described as our new best friend \\(NBF\\)  that I did not know.\n\nMy NBF and I were in completely different programs, mine was science and math based and my roommate’s was more arts and humanities. This meant my schedule was heavier and required classes starting earlier in the morning. This will come into play later.\n\nI introduced myself on our first day and we had nothing in common but I thought I would try and make the most of it. Our RA \\(Resident advisor\\) recommended that since few of us on this particular floor knew each other, leaving our room doors open while we were in our rooms encouraged people to pop in and get to know one another. This sounded like a good idea as I knew no one in the entire dorm and only two people at the entire university.\n\nWhenever I was studying or listening to music my NBF would constantly ask me to close the door. I explained what the RA had mentioned and I thought it was a good idea. Nope, NBF was not having it and told me to keep the door closed or NBF would close it.\n\nThis roommate of mine really started to get on my nerves. NBF’s CD player was a 5 disc changer \\(this fact shows my age\\) and I only ever saw 5 discs. These five discs were a cultural music that I was not used to. I had over 100 discs and let NBF look it over for others to play and the only one NBF found that could go into the rotation was Madonna’s greatest Hits. NBF would also come in late at night / morning with no regard for me, the sleeping roommate. \n\nThe doors to all rooms locked when they were closed, with only a key or a knock for the person on the inside to open it. This meant I always had my key on a lanyard around my neck “At All Times”.\n\nNow comes the Malicious Compliance part / Petty Revenge. As I left for class earlier in the morning I would be heading out when NBF was still getting ready. NBF overslept again one morning and left to go to the showers. I wasn’t quite ready to go to class yet but I thought if I pack up quickly I can leave. I left the room and made sure to “Close the Door”. This locked out my NBF with only a towel and soap.\n\nI heard from someone else on the floor that my NBF waited with a panicked look for over 3 hours outside our room. Apparently most of our floor quickly clears out in the morning and my NBF did not want to walk to the main office with just a towel so instead waited for help. During a lunch break someone on our floor who had forgotten a book and returned to the dorm found my NBF and went for help to get our room opened. \n\nIt’s funny I never kept in contact with my NBF after university. Thankfully my sophomore year was much better than my freshman year.\n\nTL;DR Closed my door locking my roommate out of our dorm room.",

Occasionally there would be a problem that would cause a service outage of some sort and I'd go in and fix it. The reasons for these outages varied, but one particular week a lot of hours had to be spent fixing them. Management was very concerned about the money that was being spent.\n\nThe new liaison I was dealing with was an efficiency expert who I had been finding a bit abrasive since I joined. He was a very no-nonsense, take no excuses kind of guy. He tells me he does not want me to work on any issues unless they're marked as 'Fires' in the ticket system and he explicitly asks me to work on them.\n\nTwo days later, he files an issue about a major service outage. It is marked as a bug, and he doesn't explicitly ask me to fix it. I know things are going to get very difficult for them if I don't fix it, but I just worked on other things.\n\nA few hours later, I receive an email from the liaison asking why the issue has not yet been fixed. I inform him 'because you did not mark it as a fire, and you did not explicitly ask me to fix it.'\n\nHis response?\n\n\"Good answer. Please elevate and fix now.\"\n\nWe got along pretty well after that.",

        "text": "This story isn't very elaborate or fancy, but it definitely gave me a Malicious Compliance vibe when it happened. I've worked in a certain pizza chain for the past couple of years while attending college, and I've been an Assistant Manager for most of the time I've been here.\n\nOur store shares a building with a small burger joint with a dentist office in\\-between, it's effectively a tiny strip mall with these 3 businesses. One night, a lady that works at said burger place comes in and orders a pasta. No problem, I ring it up and one of the employees on the line makes it right away. I noticed when boxing it up that the employee had put a bit too much in the pasta, but not a big deal.\n\nI give the pasta to the lady, and she goes back to her store for a bit before returning absolutely furious. She came in saying that we barely put anything in her pasta before handing it to me. I assured her that we definitely did put enough, but she's pissed off and wants one \"made right.\" So I say \"Okay ma'am, I'll make you a new one personally.\" She goes back to her store while I go and make the pasta.\n\nOur recipes for our items are very specific, with ingredients being measured down to a tenth of an ounce. So naturally, I make her pasta extremely meticulously, making sure not even a single noodle goes over or under the weight specified. Sure enough, she checks it and gets even more mad because this pasta has *less* than the first one did. I give her my most generous smile and ensured her that I followed every part of the recipe to the letter, and the most that could be done would be to charge for extra as this pasta followed the recipe precisely, as she requested. She didn't complain anymore after that unless there was an actual problem.\n\nAs an extra, since it's too short for its own post, I have another story to the same effect as well. A customer placed an order online for a thin crust pizza, only sauce and beef with no cheese, **\"run all the way through the oven twice.\"** Orders like this aren't too uncommon, usually just a mis\\-click when someone wants extra cheese and accidentally removes it instead. I call the customer back to make sure their cheese preference was correct, but also inform them that having a thin crust run through the oven twice was a very bad idea as it will burn. Not only did they affirm they did not want cheese \\(which would serve to protect the pizza from burning in the center\\), but ignored my insistence and warnings about the pizza burning multiple times. I also tried to advise them that I could run it partway through to get it slightly more crispy at the very least, but they still declined insisting it must be ran twice. They claimed that was how they liked it. \n\nAs I told them, the entire thing came out a dry, blackened mess, and it practically fell apart when cut with no cheese to provide even minimal insulation. When they came and picked it up, I could definitely tell they weren't happy with the result from the look on their face, as I made sure to show it to them before they left. I think they were too embarrassed to admit that I was right and took the pizza anyway instead of asking for a new one.",

One day, he and his fellow seamen decided to get breakfast at this quaint little place not far from their ship. \n\nBeing the first customers there, he and his buddies found a table, sat down, and did what every other person did at the time and began smoking cigarettes like chimneys. The waiter entered into their cloud of smoke, already with cups of black coffee and menus. He handed everything out and my grandfather quickly interjected,\n\n\n**Grandpa**: I don’t need no menu! Just give me five eggs, sunny, and a plate of toast. I’m a hungry man!\n\n\n**Waiter, shooting a confused glare**: “Sir, I don’t think you want that many eggs, they-”\n\n\n**Grandpa**: “You listen here, every morning since I could chew I’d have five eggs for breakfast and toast! (To his buddies) “Every time I order my eggs they always gotta say something! (Back to the waiter) I’ve had a long night and want to spend my time eating rather than arguing! \n\nThe waiter was obviously not liking my Grandfather’s tone, gave him one more warning.\n\n\n**Waiter**: “Are you sure you want FIVE eggs?\n\n\n**Grandpa**: Affangule/affanculo (“Fuck off” in Italian), Yes! \n\n\nThe waiter passively smiled, jotted down the rest of the orders, and went back into the kitchen. \n\nAround 45 minutes to an hour had passed, along with 6 refills each of coffee and a few packs of cigarettes. My grandfather and his buddies were obviously getting mad that breakfast is taking wayyyy longer than it should. Before you know it, the kitchen doors blasted open and coming out was the waiter and the chef balancing 5 pizza pans all holding one humongous egg each. \n\nThey set each plate down, completely covering the entire table. My grandfathers eyes shot out as wide as the pizza pans before he asked, **“What the fuck is all this?”**\n\n**“These are the five eggs you ordered sir, enjoy! The rest of the food will be coming out shortly!”**\n\nEveryone at the table began to laugh! Apparently, this place didn’t sell regular sized eggs, but ostrich eggs! My grandfather was too ignorant to listen to the waiter and got exactly what he ordered!  \n\nHe obviously didn’t  finish one, let alone five and ended up having to pay for the rest. His buddies made damn well sure that everyone on the ship knew that some Aussie waiter got the best of my hard-nosed Grandfather! \n",

Believe me, he wasn’t.\n\nAnyway, one of the girls I worked with took on the project on the condition that she could have the next July off for her wedding and honeymoon. She worked hard, and the project was actually making progress. One of her duties was passwords, none of which could be written anywhere because Genius knew this was ‘bad’. She periodically reminded Genius about the July wedding and he told her it’d be fine, but never signed off the paperwork. \nCome mid May, the project is WAY behind, mainly because Genius told management it could all be done in house at negligible cost, and Genius kept changing the design every time he read a new magazine article on IT.\nMy friend was then told 6 weeks out from the Wedding that her leave was cancelled. The project took priority and she’d just have to reschedule her wedding, honeymoon, the works. Genius could not see that this might be a problem.\nSo she did her job, updated the passwords as required, never recording them anywhere, as required,......and resigned without notice the last day of June.\n\nOn her honeymoon she gets a frantic call from Genius demanding all the passwords.\n“Sorry, I don’t work there anymore “ click.\n\nThat’s why a decade later our company still has a few hundred electronic case files we can’t access.",

        "text": "TL;DR at the bottom. LONG background story short, someone got fired where I work and they ended up hiring a lawyer as a long shot. Lawyer claimed that the guy was forced to hear racial slurs at work because of the adult-language rap lots of my coworkers played on the work stereo (including the defendant; so the attempted case was short-lived).\n\nAs a result, management insisted that no more explicit lyrics were allowed on the work stereo. A lot of my coworkers are young and cocky; and tried to cop an attitude and defy the rules...so the bosses took the stereo away. Our boss eventually gave it back, but said that *I* was personally responsible for playing music on my phone; no one else. Boss gave me a talk about how most of my coworkers are less mature than I, and I was one of the senior workers there; lead by example, etc.\n\nSo I plug in my phone. Crank the speakers to max...and out comes Britney Spears \"Oops, I Did it Again\"! Quite the change from the \"ganster rap\" everyone liked! We all have a good laugh, the song fades out...and I play Disney Showtunes for the next hour. I did a lot of singing before and during college, so I was quite good at belting it out at full volume!\n\nBy the time the hour was up, most people went from mad and vocal, to exasperatedly laughing, to enthusiastically singing along too! I was feeling the 90s pop again, so that's what we listened to for the next hour or two.\n\nEventually, the boss relents and lets someone else plug their phone in and play censored rap. Just as I tried to tell my coworkers in the beginning; management forgot about their rule after a few weeks, and uncensored rap was eventually back on the menu.\n\nMy 90s bubblegum pop is now a part of the normal rotation. Every once in a while, during a rough day, we will still have a Disney \"Power Hour\".\n\n**TL;DR ** Coworkers defy a new \"no explicit lyrics on the work stereo\" rule and blast unedited gangster rap. Boss says I must choose the music, and I force everyone to listen to 90s pop and Disney music until my coworkers comply again.",

For as long as anyone can remember, we've always given out cords to graduating seniors who have earned it through contribution to the club, time spent, and service hours from outreach events. A few weeks back, we had our banquet to give out superlatives, letters, pins, bars, and cords (I'm not a senior yet, so I didn't get a cord). We weren't made aware of the situation until today.\n\n\nOur robotics club sponsor (CS), whom a few of my robotics friends and I eat in the room of during lunch, told us about an email he received from a graduation coordinator/administrative person. She said that cords are only allowed to be awarded to academic honors clubs. My CS informed her that he had already given them out, had been for years now, and she even had an extra box laying around waiting for future years. She replied that despite this, our high school would not be recognizing the cords. And, that graduates already wear too many adornments. My CS sent back an email saying he agrees, they look like Captain Crunch, and attached a picture of Captain Crunch to the email (she replied with a 'lol' and said to spread the word). Here is where the malicious compliance comes in...\n\n\nMy CS has been telling every senior on the team that our high school is not officially recognizing the cords. _BUT_, he is also telling them that they should wear them anyway, if they want (and they do). I guess Administration Lady is just going to have to deal with seeing one more adornment, even if they aren't going to recognize it.",

I almost always play with my friends, but the guy who usually plays ADC for me has started playing top and won’t play bot anymore (this is kinda important). So now I am left with someone who more recently joined our group (I am still in school) and has started playing Ashe. The new guy is a great guy but sucks so bad at adc and can’t finish a kill. I have started getting my W for Janna at level two (basically a damaging slowing move) instead of my E (a shield). Now that that was explained let’s commence.\n\nI joined our Discord server one day and found out that all my friends had just started a game and were in a five queue. I was a little disappointed but didn’t really care and just wanted to play, so I started up a draft pick game and chose jungle. When I got into the game our adc and support were very clearly together (they were in a clan together) and the support asked to switch with me to get jungle. I was fine with this since I play support as well as jungler so I just picked Janna. Keep in mind that this was my fourth time playing Janna and I had only recently got her from a champ shard. When we got into the game I got my Q (a knock up) and went bot lane. Normally when I play support I ban Sona since I really hate her and everyone who plays her. Of course since I thought I was playing jungle I banned Reingar instead and so I didn’t ban Sona. Of course I soon realized that I was playing against a Sona and Tristana combo. After leashing or jungler my adc and I went back to lane and I started poking the tristana/Sona combo with my Q. Once their support was low on health I knocked her up again and my adc went in on her. I was level two at the time and instead of getting my E (the shield) out of habit I got the W (extra damage and slow). My adc overextended themselves and proceeded to get themselves killed while I got away with a flash. Normally I would have brought heal but the adc insisted that I bring ignite instead and so normally I would of healed them and we would have both gotten out but my adc had used both their heal and flash to go in on the support and my Q and W were on cool down.  ADC proceeds to roast me for not getting my E and says “Of you don’t get your E as Janna on level two you should just leave the game.” I proceeded to do just that, I left the game took the leaver buster and closed LoL. \n\nTL:DR: Help out ADC’s friend, adc is toxic and tells me to leave, I leave",

        "text": "edited: formatting \\+ some grammar\n\nI'm a seasonal ocean lifeguard at a pretty upscale beach town on the Jersey Shore. Now, it definitely has its ups \\- because we are dealing with lots of wealthy people with no real\\-world problems, the general attitude from beach patrons is very positive. Lots of respectful old money, so it's no Santa Monica full\\-time\\-social\\-media\\-influencer\\-part\\-time\\-piece\\-of\\-shit crowds. I am a pretty easygoing lifeguard and give lots of warnings, because I grew up on the beach and broke many beach rules myself so I try to focus on safety in the ocean instead of nitpicking the responsible adults drinking a beer that's covered by a koozie. But I can be firm. And there are some bad eggs.\n\nThere are several different types of guarded beaches \\- regular beaches, surfing only beaches \\(no swimmers\\), and bathing only beaches \\(no boogie boards, large inflatables\\). Last summer, I'm guarding a bathing only beach. I see two parents take their two really young kids into waist\\-deep water, far away from all the other bathers. The kids have a pair of swimmies \\(inflatables that go around your arms\\) and a very small inflatable ring. Technically against the rules, but they're far away from everyone, teaching their kids how to swim, and they're being extremely discreet. I let it slide.\n\nTwo older ladies come up to me and ask me \"Are you going to tell them they can't use inflatables? They've been out for awhile now and you haven't said anything.\" I respond politely \"They're not bothering anyone, and their parents are clearly teaching them to swim so I am going to let it slide.\" The one lady gives me a defiant smile and says \"Well this is our beach, we've lived here for 10 years, so we know the rules around here\". Funny, because that would still give me seniority by almost 15 years, being a local. I look at her, nod and sigh, she gives me an 'oh well what can you do' smile and says to me \"Rules are rules, sweetie. If everyone did it this wouldn't be a bathing only beach would it?\"\n\nYou're right, ma'am. Rules are rules.\n\nI go out to the parents, apologize, and tell them they can't have inflatables in the water. They seem confused, I explain it's because someone with nothing better to do complained and I can't do anything about it because they're technically right. But I have a plan. I run back to the stand, and wait for the inevitable. I glance behind me and see the ladies go back and start taking out sandwiches from a cooler that they brought. I grab my torp and head back beach to have a little chat with them. \"Excuse me,\" I said, \"I'm sorry to bother you, but you unfortunately cannot eat on the beach.\" They look at me, stunned. \"It says here, rule 22 section b of the local ordinance,\" pointing at my official laminated beach ordinance card, \"That 'picnicking', meaning the consumption of prepared food products, is not permitted on the beaches during guarding hours,\" One of the ladies, in all her hypocrisy, stammers out \"Y\\-yeah, but come on, everyone is eating on the beach! Don't be ridiculous!\"\n\n\"Sorry ma'am, rules are rules.\"\n\nYou can't even describe how good that felt coming out of my mouth. The one who initially said it looked at me, went to say something and stopped mid\\-syllable... they both broke into a series of oh come on, this is stupid, etc, and I said \"listen, you can eat on the beach. But I hope you learned the point I'm trying to make. Live and let live.\" They shook their heads in disgust. I walked back to the stand smiling.\n\nShe called the shack \\(lifeguard headquarters\\) complaining an hour later. Captain brought me over next morning during roll call, smiling, said to me not to do that again. Good times.\n\nEdit: When I spoke with the family with the two young kids, I pointed them to a beach two blocks down \\(short walk\\) where they could use them without fear of cranky beach patrons tattling on them. They were more than happy to take the 2 minute walk. \n\nTl;dr \\- Don't dictate rules to the person who's job it is to know them.",

        "text": "TL;DR at the end! \n\nSo I work at a print shop within a national office retailer (you know the one). One of our most popular products is our business cards, because they’re ridiculously cheap for a large amount and you can order and pickup same-day. The only issue is, they are a complete pain in my ass to make, for several reasons. First reason is, it’s pretty hard to align our template in the printer so that both sides print correctly. Second reason is because our business card cutter occasionally decides to throw a hissy fit and cut things at an angle. \n\nOf course, corporate won’t spring for a new cutter or a properly aligned printer, but I’ve managed to tame the beast pretty well. Now the cutter only cuts sideways cards every 7/8 pages or so. It’s not much of a loss for us if it means we get straight business cards. \n\nAnyways, this is all setup to say that due to the cutter problems, I ALWAYS print extra pages with my orders. It’s not an exact science, and I’m overly cautious, so really often customers will get 10-20 more cards than they ordered, especially in larger orders. It’s win-win. \n\nHOWEVER. The special boxes we put our business cards in are very slightly bigger than the amount they should actually hold. Not sure why that is, but our 500 card boxes actually hold around 560 cards (I’ve checked), meaning that there’s about a quarter to a half inch of room in the box. Be assured though, I’ve never shorted a customer on cards. \n\nToday a very picky and Anal Lady (henceforth AL) came in for her 500 prepaid business cards. I showed her a single card, and she was delighted with the quality and how they turned out. But then I opened the box. AL sees the quarter inch of room and absolutely flips out. \n\nAL: Is this a fucking joke? \n\nMe: I’m sorry? \n\nAL: I’ve ordered with you before, there has NEVER been this much room in the box. I paid for 500 business cards, not 400. \n\nNow, I printed these cards myself. I very specifically remember that I printed 54 pages of 10, and only 2 pages were messed up, so there were 520 cards in this box. Also, I’ve never seen her or recognized her name, sooooooo we’ve got a classic case of “I come here all the time!!”. \n\nMe: Ma’am I can assure you there’s 500 cards in this box. \n\nAL: -snorts- I don’t believe you. \n\nMe: I promise you, I’d never short a customer of cards. \n\nAL: Oh you PROOOMISE me? Then why don’t you count them to make sure? I want EXACTLY 500 cards in this box, not even one less. \n\nMe: Exactly 500? \n\nAL: Exactly. Five. Hundred. \n\nMe: Okay. \n\nWell, I’m sure you can guess what happened next. I stood in front of her, spreading the cards out on the counter and counting them aloud one by one. I stacked them in stacks of 20 for clarity’s sake. AL, of course, stood over me the entire time. An eternity later we hit 500, and of course there were 20 left in my hand. \n\nMe: Alright ma’am, sorry for all the trouble. Thank you for counting with me, I’m glad we could make sure your order was EXACTLY 500 cards. \n\nI moved to put the rest of the cards in the trash. AL began to stutter. Her argument was crumbling to pieces right in front of her eyes. It was beautiful. \n\nAL: What do you think you’re doing with those? Those are my cards. \n\nMe: No ma’am, you made it clear your order was exactly 500 cards, not a single one less. It looks like we messed up your order and put 20 extra in there. Sorry about that! I’ll just be getting rid of these for ya.\n\nAL: Well that can’t be possible. There was room in the box. You must have counted wrong. \n\nMe: Well I am a humanities major, so math isn’t really my strong suit. You’re free to check my work :) For now I’ll keep these cards back here. \n\nI put the 20 cards on my counter and watched as she feverishly recounted her cards. Exactly 500, yet again. She slipped out of the store without making eye contact while I was with another customer. Glad I could fix her order for her :) :) :) \n\nTL;DR: Lady thinks I shorted her on her business card order, requests that I count them in front of her and make sure there were EXACTLY 500 cards. There were 520. I apologize for messing up her order and throw out her bonus 20 cards. Feeling very malicious and compliant right now. ",

        "text": "\\[Edits at the bottom.\\]\n\nThis happened to me, circa 2004. Warning: This story is NOT funny. Malicious Compliance of a different color. Changed my life for the better. Still gives me chills.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nWorking McDonalds Drive\\-Thru. No speaker. Two order windows and a third pickup window. Charles is working Window 1. I'm working Window 2. Charles is black, ripped, tall, huge, has prison tats all down his arms, somewhere between half an ounce or two of fat on his body. Picture Terry Crews with darker skin and black tats to the wrists. Charles is equal parts charming, soft\\-spoken, humble, and ambitious. He knew where he had been and was determined to change his life. Probably one of the best men I'll have ever met.\n\nEnter Green Minivan...\n\nWe had both taken orders at the same time and mine was long gone. Charles' order was taking FOREVER. Probably 4 minutes just taking the order before payment. I come over to check on Charles. Before I get close I notice he's blocking the frame of the window so I can't hear anything. It's an awkward position for him and blatantly obvious. He moves his hand out to me out of sight of the van and gives me the stop sign. \"Back off.\" Got it. Time passes. Manager on duty comes out to check the issue. He waves her off. She protests, I tell her to wait and see. Something is deeply wrong.\n\nSuddenly, Charles points the van down to the other window and LEAPS into action. Slams the window, shoves past us without a word, and races to the third window. Manager and I look at each other, check for other cars \\(none\\), then follow at a distance. Manager had been running the order but Charles took over and personally handled every part of the order with the speed of a madman and quality of a 5\\-star restaurant. He grabs a new batch of fries. He has the cook triple check each burger. He breaks a cardinal rule of the store and shows the van all the kids' meal toys we have for personal preference. Drinks and condiments are handed out and Charles gives them a genuine smile and enthusiastically thanks them for being customers. \"Have a great night. We'll see you soon.\"\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nCharles waits until they are out of sight before returning from the window and visibly shaken, walks back to his register. Manager starts to fuss about an explanation she's owed but Charles just says he can't yet. His legendary zen calm is severely damaged. After a few minutes to get a drink, wipe the sweat off his face and compose himself he opens up. Van had rolled up. Charles had greeted them with the usual: \"Welcome to McDonalds, what can I get for you this evening?\" and his winning smile. White father driving waits for Charles to finish and with a loud sneer had turned to the wife and for all to hear said: \"You order, Hun. I don't talk to N\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*s!\"\n\nWife turns to the two young kids, probably 8 and 10. Impressionable. Learning. Watching. They had locked eyes on Charles. They'd seen his tats. They'd listened to the hateful otherizing of 'those people' from birth. Charles decided that he had it within him to reach for something better. Father be damned, he's long gone. Charles decided that he had a message for those boys. The wife patiently and sheepishly took the excrutiatingly and needlessly complicated order from the father and then had to speak past him to Charles. Same for the kids. Light mustard. Three pickles. Etc. Perfectionism.\n\nCharles reached down inside himself for something that neither I nor the manager possessed and he gave the wife a genuine smile as he whipped out the order. The father knew he had been served a dish he thought impossible to serve. It was served with kindness and compassion and a compliance that defied everything he'd told them about 'those people.'\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nThe kids both waved to Charles from the back of the van as the father pulled away. They liked their new friend.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\n\\[Edit: \\-Wow. I'm deeply honored at the responses this got. I was thinking a few hundred might see it and say it was neat.\n\n\\-Thank you for the gold. I'm honored to be a witness to what Charles did and to honor his story.\n\n\\-It really happened sometime between 2002 and 2004 in Arlington, Texas. The dates are fuzzy because I was a dorky college kid \\(17\\-18ish\\) and was dealing with lots of other issues at the time.\n\n\\-Here's a Google StreetView from 2008 that shows the store as it was. The layout was weird. Window 1, Charles' register for ordering, was facing West. Window 2, dorky college me's register, further down the curve of the building facing SouthWest. Window 3, pickup food and drinks facing South. [https://goo.gl/maps/pA4aGK8oW272](https://goo.gl/maps/pA4aGK8oW272)\n\n\\-For those that have asked what makes this MaliciousCompliance, I've had \\~15 years to think through it all:\n\n1. The stated intent was for Charles to be forced to serve them in a degrading and humiliating manner. The spirit of the order was goading and baiting Charles with an impossible task. Racist, Asshole Father \\(RAF\\) wanted Charles to slam the window in his face. Simply DOING HIS JOB was a slap in the face of the request. Ergo, Malicious Compliance.\n2. RAF had thought he was clever by making his reprehensible statement, but what he'd also done was write a check that his wife was forced to cash. RAF wouldn't dare sully himself by deigning to speak with one of Them, but he'd ordered his wife to do his dirty work. By taking the order, Charles was humiliating RAF and allowing RAF's demand to debase his own wife in front of him. By dragging the order out 'to make sure we get it right' he made the wife add insult to injury by repeating things from RAF to her to Charles and then back again.\n3. In my mind's eye, I can picture Charles staring very intently at a sweaty, greasy RAF as Charles holds his hands out waiting for payment. I can imagine Charles gently holding her hand mere inches from RAF's face and then placing the change back in hers. You won't talk to me, therefore you'll have to watch as I touch your wife with my hands, right in front of your children.\n4. The last part of the order was also the most crucial. If any part of it had been less than perfect, the magic would've been lost. Charles made sure that nobody else handled anything for them. He was responsible for EVERYTHING being perfect. That's why he hustled. The order was made excellent by Charles doing all the work. You hate black people, yet every bite of this meal is going to be the best meal you've ever had here because I MADE IT BETTER.\n5. The RAF drove off with his tail so tucked it must've hurt. His wife had been dragged through the mud by his own demands, some black guy had made friends of his own children, and the coals from Charles' fire had been heaped onto his head, again, all in front of his own family because of his idea of being snarky or funny and racist.\n\n\\-I wish I knew where Charles was or what happened to him. I love the idea of seeing where those boys went and what impact he had on their terrible childhoods. This is Reddit though. Arlington, Texas, 2002\\-2004, Charles from McDonalds on Matlock and Sublett.\\]\n\n\\[Edit 2: I mentioned Charles explaining to the Manager, Payal, what had actually happened in a comment and included it here for closure. \\-I left out the manager's reaction afterwards. She freaked out on him and demanded to know why he did that when she was supposed to slam the window in the dad's face. He was still cooling off with a drink but stood up to his full height and stared her down. He's like 6'3, she was 4'11 and suddenly felt her size. That's when he explained that what he did wasn't for Charles, her, me, the dad, or even 'that poor woman he's got speaking for him.\" It was for the boys in the back and ending ignorance with him. \"If I had responded with anger, I'd have proved him right and he could turn to them and say 'see? They're nothing but angry N\\*\\*\\*\\*s.' I gave them a message. I might be the first black man to ever show them something better.\" \\(Severely paraphrased from 14\\-15 years ago but that whole thing is seared into me.\\)\\]",

        "text": "LTR; FTP. I am on mobile so excuse my spelling.\n\nSo, I work in the office division for a large electronics retailer.  I won't get into my job too much because it's besides the point, but it often involves searching the web for manuals and brochures on a wide variety of products.\n\nThe IT department in my company has a large stick up its ass and likes to block access to a bunch of pages for all mere mortals in the company. In this particular case, I needed access to some manuals that were being hosted on a cloud storage website (like Dropbox). Naturally, IT had it blocked, so I requested access to it in order to do my job.\n\nNow, when we request access to a page, they ask us to specify the length of time we need it for and whether it's just that one page or the full domain. Since I knew I was going to be working with several products from that company, I set the time to \"end of week\" and asked for the full domain, figuring that was fair. I got an email back saying it was approved, but instead the setting had been changed to just that URL and not the entire website.\n\nWell, that didn't help my case, so I submitted a second request for a different page with the same specifications. This time, IT wanted to make sure I knew NOT to do that. A call comes to my desk, conversation goes something like this:\n\n$me: \"Hi, this is gus_frin_g, how can I help you?\"\n\n$IT: \"Hi, I just received your second request for access to www.shittywebsite.com. I can't give you access to the full domain due to security concerns, so I'm going to have to deny it. I'll give you this one file but please don't do that again.\"\n\n$me: \"Well, I need access to these files in order to do my job. There's several of them so I figured I'd save us both time by just getting access to the domain. That's all.\"\n\n$IT: \"I understand sir but again I can't do that for you. It's just our internal policy.\"\n\n$me: \"That's ok, but how should I proceed? I still need the information.\"\n\n$IT: \"If you know the exact files you need, you can request access to the URLs individually. I can make sure there is nothing malicious on them, and then forward the file to you. Again, I can't let you access the entire Shittywebsite domain, it's too much of a risk.\"\n\n$me: (in the cheery retail voice) \"No problem! I will make sure to do that then. Thanks for your help.\"\n\n$IT: \"No problem\" *click*\n\nSee, here's the thing I omitted from our conversation. I am working with this company's entire line of products, around 100 or so individual items. Each one of them has a manual, a brochure, and a technical drawing, all of which I need to see for different pieces of information. I think you can do the math on how many requests that is.\n\nBeing the good worker bee that I am, I went ahead and submitted individual requests for every. Single. File. It helped that most of them are all on the same page in the company's website, so that made it easy. Of course on his end, he's having to open each request individually, look through the document to \"make sure there is nothing malicious\", download it then forwarding it to me. Needless to say my requests quickly outpaced his replies.\n\nI can still see the emails rolling in as I am typing this post. I figure this guy is either too prideful to admit his mistake, or his boss doesn't care and is forcing him to do all this work. Either way I feel bad for him, but then again that's what happens when your IT department treats everyone like an oversized toddler. Enjoy your 300+ requests ;)",

        "text": "Beware, lots of creative paraphrasing in this post, to make it somewhat readable and \\(hopefully\\) less boring. Also, spelling\\-warning, no spellcheck makes me lousy at this. \n\nLast year, we \\(read: my company\\) landed a pretty sweet, 5\\-year Safety and Environmental \\(ISO 45000 and 14000 for you nerds\\) auditing contract for a very large construction/contracting company. They basically pay me to update the manuals, get people educated and make sure the new rules being followed.\n\nAs usual, 80&amp;#37; of the people are fine with everything, either because they like their job and will follow the rules, or because they care deeply about not having their skulls crushed, or for whatever other reason. 15&amp;#37; of people just don't get what they're supposed to be doing, but are completely willing once you tell them \\(again, or maybe a third time\\). Then there's the last 5&amp;#37; of people who think things like \"safety\" and \"environment\" are annoyances that get in the way of making lots of money.\n\nEnter Project Lead Dickface \\(PLD\\). PLD's hobbies include reporting huge profits, driving employees to the hospital, and having the lowest overhead of any job. PLD managed to attend the bare minimum of the meetings about the new rules, though I doubt he read a single slide, unless they were on his phone too.\n\nAfter all the planning and paperwork is done, everyone has been \\(mostly\\) educated and all the new forms and procedures have been rolled out, it's field\\-audit time. I send out a checklist to project leads and/or foremen so they can check if everything is done right. Now, nobody gets through these unscathed, because that's not the point. You're not getting a fine for getting an answer wrong, and you won't get fired for not doing your paperwork. If you don't know, I \\(or your boss\\) probably taught you wrong and I \\(or your boss\\) needs to fix that, not you. The average site had 10\\-30 things out of order, which is pretty decent.\n\nPLD's site, together with two other \\(out of 30\\-ish nationally\\) reported zero items out of order. And that means they're either lying, or they were at one time bitten by a radioactive OSHA\\-inspector. So I give my three potential superhero friends a call. Two admitted there might have been a few things that they fixed immediately, so I explain they still have to note those, and try again. They chose wisely. PLD however, get's super offended. How dare I suggest he's doing anything wrong! He's sick and tired of my stupid ideas and never doing them, whilst simultaneously sticking exactly to his \\(read: my\\) instructions.\n\nI start with a call to PLD's Boss. He's completely uninterested; PLD's results are great and that's all that matters. Besides, aren't they paying me for this? He shouldn't have to get involved, and when I asked him if it's not a problem his \"best guy\" is apparently breaking the law and whether he wants to get involved, he tells me \"No, you get to the bottom of this! Don't call me till your find out everything\" Alrighty then, I can do that!\n\n**Round 1: \"No, you get to the bottom of this!\"**\n\nAt first he refused to give me the dress of his site, but PLD apparently realized that hiding a multiple square kilometer area wasn't a great tactic, so he went for the other tried\\-and\\-failed method of \"nobody say nothing!\". This occasionally happens; I get to a site and everyone who knows anything is missing, no critical work is being done this week and thus no responsibilities need to be taken, and yet everyone else is too busy to answer questions.\n\nThat's cool, because I've got the magical power of \"discretionary funds\", which can be used to order a big fancy lunch for people who get called in for a few quick questions. Suddenly, the glaring lack of knowledge and training is revealed, and I get the fun job of actually asking PLD if he did anything about safety ever, because I've got a good 50 issues just from talking to people.\n\nOf course he did. He's been doing this for longer than I've been alive! What does a little like me know? bla bla bla.\n\nHe makes the amazing claim that literally all of his worker are trying to frame him, and I shouldn't listen to them at all. haw haw. So why don't we schedule a joint inspection? Obviously it's now 3pm on thursday, and they don't work friday, so maybe next Monday? Next monday, I can \"Be a total Nazi on the site\".\n\n**Round 2: \"Be a total Nazi!\"**\n\nI totally agree to that, and suggest maybe right now will do better. He doesn't have to come, but of course he does. I spend about 7 minutes walk, and 53 minutes noting down shit that is so extremely not\\-ok a blind man can see the violations. Not little stuff like \"this hammer is a tripping hazard\", but think \"Safetyline attachment point not actually attached to wall\" and \"12 meters of scaffold\\-floorboard missing because it fell down\" and \"generator leaking diesel into a lake full of swans\" and \"just pour that grease in a hole and close it\", I decided that was about the point I should probably do something right now. I turn to PLD, and he tells me to \"Just call the boss, because I'm done with these lies!\".\n\n**Round 3: \"Just call the boss\"**\n\nTo my surprise, the Big Boss \\(Basically the guy who counts all the money the company makes in this country\\) already expected my call. PLD turns out to be his good buddy, and I'm being super unfair to him! He's the best project lead they have, you know. I should absolutely take it easy, because he's extremely important and it's a high\\-prestige job. Thankfully, I know any big boss' primary weakness. The conversation goes something like this:\n\n&gt;In just one hour I've walked about a fifth of this site, and if you got officially inspected right now, you'd have a fine of about, uhm let's see: 80.000 and 80.000 is 160, and 100 is 260 and another 40 is 300.000 euro, plus seven times 20.000 makes 440.000 and... Well, let's say a good million euros before they even get inside.\n\nSuddenly, PLD and the Big Boss weren't such good friends. I found, without being \"A Total Nazi\" about 88 unique violations. PLD is doing \"mostly office work for a while\", while the new project lead calls me every day to ask if something is OK or not.",

        "text": "This happened a long while back, over a decade ago. I’ve also posted it elsewhere but was told it would fit here. So back in the day I was working in retail, specifically I was managing a specialist bra fitting shop. We all know retail sucks balls, and this is my absolute favourite memory from those days.\n\nOne day I was working the change room desk upstairs, taking bookings for fittings and helping the 10 or so customers in the rooms for people who didn't need a fitting but needed me to just quickly check things sometimes and fetch different sizes etc. It was busy, it was always busy, and a woman came in on the lunch rush and demanded a fitting.\n\nI politely told her that I was very sorry but all the fitters were pre-booked and with other customers for the next hour or two, so I could help her a bit but can't give 1-1 attention as I'm helping all the other rooms as well. If she wants the full thing she would need to pop back tomorrow or later.\n\nShe flew off the handle, telling me how busy and important she was, that she made a special trip, she can't come back tomorrow, I should help her etc. She was really rude, aggressive and mean. I just politely repeated over and over that I was very sorry but I couldn't help her as I had other customers to attend to, and no, I can’t pull the other girls out of their already booked fittings, and yes, as you can see on this sheet they really are all booked for the rest of the day. She ranted at me a while but then left. No biggie, this is your average day in retail. \n\nA few minutes after she went downstairs I got a call from one of the till girls saying a customer was complaining about the young girl on the fitting desk who refused to help her even though she could see spaces on the list, and had been rude and had been swearing at her and wanted to see the manager about it. It should be noted I was about 24 at the time, but looked really young - maybe 18. She clearly had no idea I was the manager. I saw red, this bitch is trying to get what she thinks is “just a shop girl” in trouble, it could have been any of my staff, it just wasn’t right. I saw an opportunity to serve some justice.\n\nSo, she wants to see the manager? The manager she will get. I told the desk girl I would be down shortly.\n\nI check my face, smooth my hair, and generally take my sweet, sweet time. Then I slowly walked down those steps, oh so slowly, wearing a huge shit eating grin to let the horrible woman gradually recognise who I was. When she saw it was me her face was just a picture. I played along asking for a description of the \"girl\" who was so rude, as that is very much outside our standards I am shocked to hear such a thing happened, I was actually upstairs at the time and certainly would have intervened if I had heard such a thing etc. Shit eating grin on full power the whole time.\n\nShe had caused such a scene that all the people in the shop were staring at us. So she either had to admit she had been lying and trying to get what she thought was some poor shop girl fired, or she had to make up a description with me obviously going to be saying things like \"hmm, no one here looks anything like that - try again\". \n\nShe just was at a loss for words, her mouth agape gasping for air, bright red, not making eye contact. I forget if she said anything at all but she stood there for a long while, and just left.\n\nI have never felt such satisfaction as I did walking down those stairs knowing what was about to happen.\n",

        "text": "Another tale from good 'ol Grocery Gulag.\n\nBack when I was relatively new to the job, most everyone was very friendly toward eachother and we all had eachoher's backs. One of us was falling behind? Ain't no big, we got you. One of us is too busy to do floor inspections? Floral employee can spare a couple minutes to do them so you won't get in trouble, all cool.\n\n*But then, the fire nation attacked...*\n\nOkay, not as dramatic, but halfway into my first year at the job things kinda took a dramatic shift. People weren't as friendly toward eachother. It quickly started turning into a game of every man for themselves, and the management team quit really batting for everyone under them and began acting like total dicks.\n\nThis occurred during the beginning of when things started rolling downhill. At the time, I was more than happy to show up and help out when needed. If someone called off, or the store was getting hammered, I'd not be opposed to showing up and working a quick 4h shift until they were back on their feet. Wasn't a big deal for me. I was very friendly with the night manager at the time, and she called me in a few times because things were getting out of hand.\n\nOnto the actual story: Seeing as my work was also the closest not-a-warehouse-store to me, I would frequently dip in to grab a couple things if I didn't want to wait in a mile-long line. One night I show up, and the parking lot is absolutely destroyed. Carts are everywhere, absolutely none in the store for the customers to use, everything is trashed. And I see my (very pregnant) night manager outside trying to manage the mess and struggling hard. I quickly find out the only utility clerk on the clock is on lunch, and his backup called off.\n\nNot even for the job, but just because, you know, seeing someone struggle like this just wasn't my thing, I jump in (without clocking in, mind, because I really don't give a shit about 10 minutes of pay and even then I was just attempting to be chivalrous) and help out. I got her caught up and that was that, good deed did for the day, so on and so forth. Right?\n\nWrong.\n\nNext day (when I'm scheduled with her) I get called up to the office and presented with a written warning for not working my scheduled shift and being distracting toward co-workers whilst off the clock. Both the store manager and night manager are berating me for being a distraction and told me to only ever work my scheduled shifts.\n\nMy attitude toward that job did a complete 180, and honestly, I should have probably just quit because that was really the turning point for that job. But bills to pay, etc etc.\n\nUp until that point, I was the guy who'd be happy to take extra (paid) shifts to keep the place running smoothly when someone called off, but after that point? Nah. You said only work my scheduled shifts, right? That's exactly what I did. I only worked the schedule that was printed every week, no more, no less. Store's on fire and you need me to come in to help? Nah, get fucked. Half the employees called off and you'll pay me double time and a half to come help? Nope, my time's more valuable than that, get fucked.\n\nThe fun part? This night manager went on family leave when she had her kid, but would still show up at the store to buy things, and even though she was very much off the clock, she'd scream at employees for stupid little things. Like she was shopping down an aisle I was sweeping up and told me to go to the bathroom and tuck in my shirt while she was off the clock. Okay, *now* who's distracting employees off the clock?\n\n(I actually ended up breaking this pact to not pick up extra shifts ONCE, and instantly regretted it. But this tale is already getting lengthy so maybe I'll expand in the comments.)",

I had just one more person left in line, but the phone was ringing (the restaurant has this unspoken policy to never miss a call) and nobody was picking it up. I asked the customer over 3 times if it was okay if I answered the phone due to this policy, and he did not care. \n\nI took the call, no problem, and while I was finishing it up, the manager that night, we’ll call him AM (asshole manager), came up and helped out the customer I had in line. After we had both finished with our respective customers AM turns to me and the conversation goes as such:\n\nAM: “you had a customer in line and you were on the phone. I cannot have you taking phone calls anymore tonight.”\n\nMe, attempting to explain why I had answered the phone and that I had clarified multiple times with the waiting customer that it was okay: “I understand, but-“\n\nAM: “No. I do not what you answering the phone. In fact, I don’t want you to leave reg 1 at all tonight. This is what I’m telling you to do, so you are going to do it.”\n\nMe: “okay.”\n\nSo for the rest of the night I sat on reg 1. The phone was ringing off the hook, I had no customers, and I just stood there watching AM answer all of the calls. On top of the phone, if a customer needed something I couldn’t reach from my register, I would call AM over to take care of it. At the end of the night we had a huge line on reg 2, and AM was working his ass off while I stood idle by, because I was specifically told not to leave reg 1. ",

My old boss was a little wary about the lack of details for the job but offered it to me anyway, me and a rigger of our acquaintance would pick up a tent from a depot and drive an hour to a seaside holiday spot where we would erect one of these tents on a gravel drive between an open shed and a garden bed to serve as a wedding reception area.\n\nThis was on Saturday and the wedding was on Sunday, my rigger had actually been to this resort before and indicated that the owner was a piece of work, a no-nonsense woman of middle years who I didn't particularly worry about since I tend to stick to the job and nevermind the ego.\n\nWhen I laid eyes on the spot my back ached just thinking about having to somehow drive two foot pegs into the hard packed metal of the driveway, I had previously been able to wrangle electric or petrol hammers for the purpose but on this particular occasion it was just me and a sledgehammer. I was quietly realising that I was potentially facing a slow and painful defeat partly because Syd had cheerfully thought this could be done without a site inspection (my ex boss had misgivings about Syd's attitude that I was now wholeheartedly sharing.) and partly because I'd been fool enough to go along with it without asking enough questions.\n\nBut I wasn't gonna go all to pieces on the nice couple so I kept my expression placid as we rolled out the sheet to position ourselves and begin to address our challenges in a sober fashion. The nice couple and the venue owner are standing nearby as it becomes immediately obvious that the tent is just too damn big for the spot they've picked, you need a little on the margins for the angle of the tie downs and this thing wasn't barely in the footprint by itself with no margin.  \n\nSyd had said previously that he and the owner had determined that we could attach one edge directly to the shed (hence a rigger to ensure all was kosher) and the other side could extend into the garden bed provided we were not disturbing any of the native plants, so it did seem like maybe it was possible - and I did want to make this work if it could.\n\nOnly then the owner showed her colours, championing the nice couple by adamantly stating no, we could not attach to the shed, it was practically a heritage structure for how old it was and she claimed never to have agreed to such a proposition, furthermore she'd hear nothing of putting stakes in the garden bed. Her manner struck me as obstructive and critical bordering on the smug and plainly negating our plan which Syd reckoned she'd already signed off on, but for me it was light at the end of the tunnel, I was conciliatory, I told them how I wanted to make it work if we could but clearly I had no desire to argue with the lord of the manor. \n\n\"But where is the other tent that we ordered?\" The bride-to-be enquired. I was puzzled. It was a smaller tent they said, and that Syd had lately told them it was unavailable and that *this* tent would work just fine. I'd never heard of this till now, and proposed we call Syd to appraise him of the situation and get a resolution since the nice couple were leaning towards canning the project and demanding their money back. I was - perhaps a teensy bit maliciously - leaning with them, they weren't being particularly nice to me but you couldn't blame them and I was pretty much done with the idea of working for Syd again. \n\nNow, remember this takes place in a valley well outside the metro area, turns out the only place to get cell reception was up the hillside. I spent a ridiculous half an hour standing in the middle of a field with a faintly bickering couple who were outright arguing with Syd about what it would mean for us to just pack up and drive away - but gratefully we eventually did just that. Me and the rigger still got paid because the fudge ups had been purely organizational, the tent they originally ordered having been lost in interstate freight and the replacement insufficient with no satisfactory alternative. We stopped at the beach on our way home so that the day wouldn't be a complete waste, though we got a yarn out of it, how to cast shade on a wedding reception with no tent required.\n\nEdit: TL;DR added.",

        "text": "When my brother and I were in our early 20's, we worked at the same small theatre in a rather posh area of West London. It was a lovely little place with small productions and was visited by some pretty cool people, but occasionally you'd get someone visit who thought a little more highly of themselves than others - you know the type who treat service people as lowly trash and it's ok because they're sooo important? It wasn't often, but we'd have a few people visit once in a while. \n\nNow.. me and my brother are **NOT** from this posh part of London. Actually, we're born and raised in the East side - pure bred apples and pears Cockney (with a bit of grime thrown in!). But speaking to us, you'd never really guess that because we are pretty good at adjusting our accents for our workplace.. which is important for later. Also, no one knew we were related unless they worked with us. Most of our co-workers were from more affluent areas and sounded so, and were all awesome. We had great banter.\n\nAnyway - I was a barista at the time and one of the rules was if it was cutting close to the start of a show, you weren't allowed to put certain food orders through because it just wouldn't be ready in time, and if the customer wasn't seated by the time the show started they'd have to wait until the interval for entry. Most people understood, some people just thought we were lying and didn't want to take their order (I don't know what possible reason they thought I would want to lie about that ..)\n\nSo one day, LadyMcSnark comes up and demands one of said food orders and I politely explain the above scenario, point her to the foods that are able to be ordered and ask if I could interest her in one of those. I guess somewhere along the line my accent slipped up (it just does! I'm not ashamed of it, but it can be hard to mask! I drop the occasional T now and then..) and her face just turned. \n\nIt was a pure twist of disgust and her voice changed, I could almost feel the disdain pouring out of her mouth.. \n\"OH. Of course you're incompetent. You're not *from here*. I want to speak to your supervisor. I want to make a complaint about your service skills.\"\n\nI was pretty taken aback, but not surprised. We've both had this a lot. I asked her if she was *sure* she wanted to speak to my supervisor. She assured me she absolutely was. I was happy to comply.\n\nSo I called my supervisor over. My supervisor was my brother, at that time. *Because he is awesome.*\n\nHe asked LadyMcSnark what the problem was, and she proceeded to insult me personally, about my \"poor service skills\" being a result of my social background and how I didn't belong there having come from \"that place\".\n\nPutting on his best Cockney accent he replied, asking her if she wanted to continue personally insulting me, his sister and coworker, or if she would like to pipe down and continue taking her order with him - who reiterated the same menu rules. I've never seen someone gasp in such a dramatic way - it was wonderful. She did shut up and place her order.\n\ntl:dr Posh lady realises I'm from East London and insists on seeing my supervisor to complain. Supervisor is my brother with an awesome sense of humour.",

This one is from a few years ago when I was at university. \n\nOne of our compulsory classes was a work experience one. You had to do a month work experience and write an essay about it. You also had to write an essay about yourself. \n\nI found this class completely pointless (for me personally). I could understand it if you were an inexperienced teen that never had a job, but I had okay proof I could work. \n\nAfter being refused a class transfer I was told to make the essay the essence of me, show them who I was by the work experience coordinator.\n\nThe work I produced had quotes from various terrible films, comedians (think Frankie Boyle, Ed Byrne and so on) and was a scathing put down of the module. All properly referenced etc so that it had to be marked. \n\nFor a few weeks, silence. \n\nI then received an email from the work experience coordinator &amp; the head of my department for a meeting. \n\nI sit down in the meeting and they quietly pull a copy of my printed essay out with red circles everywhere. \nThe work experience coordinator was very irate and frazzled, essentially shouting that my work was an insult to her module and that she wanted to fail me and do it again. \n\nI smiled and told her I had simply showed them the essence of who I am. \n\nThe work experience coordinator refused to talk to me during the meeting after that. \nI was told by my head of department that the essay made them worry about me mentally but it was a reflective essay and was properly academically referenced. Much to the coordinators chagrin. \n\nAs a result I had passed the module, but was on academic probation for the rest of the year and was also urged to get counselling. \n\nTLDR: was told to write an essay and show who I was. Showed who I was and coordinator tried to fail me. I passed the class. \n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nI may post the malicious compliance that occurred during my second year tomorrow. \n\n\n",

We have mock layouts of multiple stores on the ground floor of the building that we use to set up product before we send it to the store. I have a manager who is very specific about things. He needs things displayed in a certain order in a specific way. He is also very conscious of appearance. He leaves work early on a regular basis to get his hair cut (which he hardly has any), manicures and pedicures. He was bragging about his $80 socks one day and I made an offhand comment that they cost more than my entire outfit. One of his biggest sticking points is there are absolutely no sneakers. Even on casual Friday sneakers are not allowed. He believes sneakers should never ever be worn with jeans. The room with the mock layouts has a concrete floor and we may spend our entire day there working on a project. Some people in other departments wait until Friday to work in there because their manager allows them to wear sneakers. So last year we were bought by a larger company and they rewrote the employee handbook. My manager has been emailing the team every day to read the employee handbook and sign off. To his displeasure the handbook permits sneakers in Friday. It no longer leaves it up to the manager. As soon as my team read this they brought it to his attention. In the Monday morning meeting this morning it was announced with displeasure on his face that sneakers are now permitted.\n\nTldr;manager said no sneakers. Forced us to read employee handbook.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8je35i/my_promotion_to_bucket_bitch/",
        "text": "Years ago, my best friend, B, helped get me a job in an upscale restaurant where he had been serving for a few years. The average two-top ran about 50 bucks, so it was pretty decent money. The food was amazing, the people were mostly nice, and the boss was an asshole. \n\n\nMy boss, K, was probably about twenty years older and very conservative and judgmental about a lot of really little things. He was a former frat boy type, and he tended to be a lot more friendly with the preppier and sportier types he hired. Anything that identified a person as existing outside of the mainstream, though, was a fair target for ridicule. For my part, I had strange pets, exotic piercings, unusual hobbies, and a penchant for cerebral and complex narrative media, whereas everything about K’s sensibilities said that he was more of a dogs, sports, and sitcoms kind of guy. I am not saying any of those things are bad or wrong, but I _am_ saying that it is very likely that K and I would not have been friends if we had been contemporaries. I have a strong feeling K would have seen to that.\n\n\nHere's one to give you an idea of the general flavor: I was getting ready to leave one night as K was holding court with a crowd of late-night regulars, and I put on my long, navy blue overcoat and crossed past them. \nK said, “What are you supposed to be, the Trenchcoat Mafia?” \nThe regulars at the bar all laughed at his witty and clever reference to the time a couple of troubled kids murdered a bunch of their classmates about 5 years ago. The customers, like K, had ideas of popularity and success that had never been meaningfully challenged, well into middle age. \nB, who had been eavesdropping while wiping off the bar glassware, had been there a while, though, and he knew a bit more about the guests we entertained than I did. \n“Open it up for them,” he said. \nI did, exposing the pattern in the lining, and they all flocked around me, saying things like, “Oooooh, it’s Burberry.” \nThat was literally the first time I had ever heard anyone even say “Burberry.” The coat itself was handed down by a friend who had almost certainly stolen it from a thrift store. The damage was done, though: K was visibly fuming at the shift in the attention of his adoring public. \n\n\nAnother quick one: I have a couple fake teeth from when I lost a few real ones in a skating accident, and before I got the crowns put in, I had a temporary composite--basically, tooth Bondo--in place of my 8 and 9 incisors (my two front teeth). When the composite fell off and I had to save up to get it replaced, he took me outside and threatened to fire me if I didn't get the teeth fixed in a timely fashion because it's ugly and no one wants to see that. I understand that it was a fancy place, and aesthetics are part of the package for which the customer is paying, but I feel that, if the roles were reversed, I could have delivered the message without attacking anyone's self-esteem.   \n\n\nEach day was composed of instances like that. He really didn't like me, but he knew he couldn't _just_ fire me without it potentially causing larger issues for him. This is often the time when owners and managers tend to look for ways to make an employee's time at work so unpleasant that they decide to leave on their own. Usually, this manifests as fewer hours, ignored requests for time off, and worse shifts or sections, but K decided to get creative. \n\n\nWe had a drink bucket, which consisted of one bucket with a bunch of holes drilled in it nested within a taller bucket, the purpose of which was to strain out liquid waste--various drink leftovers--from the solid waste, such as fruit peels, toothpicks, straws and straw wrappers, empty sugar packets, cherry stems, and snotty napkins from sick kids. If you work in food service, there's a good chance you know the bucket I am talking about. \n\n\nOne day, K caught me alone and said, \"You're the bucket bitch now. That bucket is yours. I don't want to see any employee other than you touching that bucket again.\"\n\nI said, \"Yes, sir.\" He liked those little touches.\n\n\nIn the coming weeks, I didn't exactly diligently tend to the bucket... I _obsessively_ tended to the bucket.\n\n\nThere was a fill line drawn in permanent marker on the inside of the bucket a couple inches below the rim. A few inches below that was my imaginary fill line. If I saw anyone else even thinking about emptying that bucket, I would cross the kitchen and loudly condescend: \n\"Hey, put that down. K put _me_ in charge of the bucket. You don't really think you have what it takes, do you? Well, K sure didn't.\" \nI basically did everything I could to make sure that everyone knew that K specifically told me to be the bucket’s sole attendant, and that he was the sort of leader who did petty things like that if he didn’t like a person's vibe, without ever expressing it as anything other than the highest honor.\n\n\nEvery time K turned around, I was dumping that big orange bucket out or washing my hands, and after a while, everyone was in on it. We all treated that bucket like it was the most important piece of the restaurant's daily operation. If the slurry of coffee, tea, soda, water, and booze hit the fill line, someone would come running and find me, and I would make it my next order of business. We treated it like an emergency.\n\n\nMy buddy, B, even started acting a little more curt in his dealings with K, and when K finally inquired after the sudden shift in communication, B confided that he was jealous that, after years of loyal service, he wasn't even considered for very important bucket work. \n\n\nGranted, the bulk of my work was still out in the front, and the dining experience on the guest end went largely unchanged, with the obvious exception being that the snippets of conversation wafting over from the back of the house had significantly more to do with buckets than it did at your average fancy restaurant. \n\n\nAt first, K was frustrated, but he didn't know what to do. Everyone was doing exactly what he told them to do. Eventually, K tried to get back in on the bit by elevating the title to bucket boy, and again to bucket man, and finally, inevitably, to bucket master, but no one laughed. It wasn't his joke anymore, and it had long since stopped being at my expense.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: My old restaurant boss gave me a gross task to demean me, and I did it so hard it demeaned him.\n",

        "text": "I hate thinking about this, and it doesn't help that I sort think about this every single day. A few years ago, my ex (whom some of you read about recently) and I decided to do a few jobs over one summer for a catering company. Now, until that point, all of my working experience has come from the food and beverage industry. From bussing, to waitering; dishwashing to cooking, I've done it all, so I know some of the industry’s tricks and hacks, which could have been proved detrimental later on in the story.\n\nThis catering job was for the reception of a wedding, which took place in a strange museum; the location I will keep confidential. The time came, we arrived and began setting the tables up. As I was putting tablecloths on, John, one of the older waiters and supervisors there told me, with hints of snarkiness, that, \"The crease of the table cloth should always point to north in every room!\" I apologized for not knowing and continued with my side work. I'm all for standard company practices, but even I thought the tablecloth thing was kind of weird. \n\nRight before the event began, a different supervisor/manager came up to me and said John and I would be tasked with moving the wedding cake from the front of the reception to the kitchen for it to be cut and plated when the time came. I was nervous but it’s a cake. How hard could it be?\n\nThe reception so far was going well. I was doing a great job running food, making sure everyone was happy, and followed directions from the managers with ease. Before you know it, the time came and we had to move the cake. Now the cake wasn’t too elaborate, just a three layer cake with your generic wedding shit riddled on it. The table it was on was about waist-high tall and circular. John and I approached the cake and before I even placed my hands on the table, I asked him if he would care if we just moved the ENTIRE table instead of trying to just lift the cake up by itself. I’ve seen this done before at other weddings and the servers there  took no chances...\n\nJohn replied by saying no let’s do it the “old fashioned way”; that I should put my hands under the cake and just lift up like he’s going to do. Ok...so we begin trying to slither our fingers under the cake, getting frosting on our hands and looking like fools. As soon as we manage to get just a tip of a finder under, the table shifts from one of us bumping into it and BANG, the cake falls on the ground splattering everywhere. I guess this was Johns definition of “the old fashion way”...\n\nThe room went so silent, you could hear the rats fucking in the walls. I did what anyone else would do in this situation and tried to slowly walk out of frame while, John believe the bastard or not, started to LICK the frosting off of his hands! \n\nThe bride obviously cried, the groom had steam coming out of his ears, and everyone else was shocked. I was overwhelmed with shame by potentially ruining a wedding but people were very understanding and sympathetic , others, not so much. My ex, however, wasn’t too comforting, but then again, she never really was. \n\nTowards the end, the Groom came up and made his speech per tradition. \n\nHe goes on about, “ How much he loves cake and how, in college, he dreamed about eating it on his wedding day…” \n\n“Top 10 worst nights of my life.”, I thought to myself.\n\nThe next day the catering company contacted me and basically asked what happened. I told them that I recommended picking up the table with the wedding cake instead of trying to lift it by itself to John but was promptly told no (do it the old fashioned way). They understood and the next two times I did a job for the company, John wasn’t there. \n\n\n **TL;DR: I served a wedding for a catering company once and was tasked with bringing the cake to the kitchen with John (a waiter/supervisor). I recommended that we lift the whole table up rather than just the cake because it was the most logical thing to do. He promptly said no...and we dropped it in front of everyone.**  \n",

        "text": "First, a little more background on our line of work to create some context for this particular bout of compliance:\n\nWe work in exporting  fruits and vegetables to various clients around the world. The gist of our operations includes buying the product from various suppliers around the country, getting them prepped and packed, bringing them to the airport, getting them on board planes and making sure they arrive safely to the destination country. One whole operation has a lot of costs, and an income, based on our invoices, and based as well on **subsidies** that our government gives us per KG per expedition (important later).\n\nIn the beginning, when we wanted to calculate our profit margins, it was an extremely complicated process that involved calling 7 people, using 4 hours of time and many calculations on a bunch of papers. Over the months, I've created a small excel program that I've grown by myself that calculates the profit margin automatically based on a couple of variables that you can enter on one page. I've gone over the formulas with my CEO, who's validated them, and for a while now I've been calculating the profit margin automatically after each operation. An important note: Subsidies are counted in the \"Income\" section, alongside the income from the invoices. Together they form the two parts of the \"income\" section.\n\nI recently implemented a line that calculates the percentage of the final profit margin vs the whole income. For example, if we received $10,000 total for this operation, and the profit was $1,000, then we'd have a profit percentage of 10%. \n\nNaturally, I calculated this in a logical manner, taking our final margin and dividing it over the TOTAL income (including subsidies). This would give us profit margins around ~15%, which was more or less normal.\n\nOne day, my boss is looking through an \"expedition recap receipt\", a small piece of paper that I generate automatically after every expedition with information about the profit, income, and expenses of every expedition. She notices the new line with the percentage, and starts quizzing me about it. As I explain to her the way it works, she starts shaking her head and muttering to herself. \"hmmm..... I think there is a mistake...\", the dreaded words that always come out of her mouth when she looks over my work.\n\n\"How did you calculate this percentage?\"\n\n\"Well, I took our final profit and divided it over the sum of the income, and multiplied times 100\"\n\n\"What? The whole of the income? Even the subsidies?\"\n\n\"Y- yes, I mean-\"\n\n\"No! Oh my god, GTAIVisbest, do I have to baby you every step of the way? Do I have to watch over every single spreadsheet, every single report you make? You. Don't. Know. How. To. Calculate. A. Profit. Margin. This is an *industry standard*, you *never* calculate subsidies in the final percentage!\"\n\n\"How should I calculate it then?\"\n\n\"Hahowa howa^† look look\", she says, as she takes my laptop out of my hands. \"You taaake the profiit and you divide it oveer theeee incoome minuus theee subsidieees!\"\n\nI stare at her blankly, trying to understand. Before I can protest, she tells me to \"go fix my spreadsheet\".\n\nWell. Alright then, I suppose I'll go do just that.\n\nOver the next week we have three expeditions, and I generate three different margin receipts with HUGE profit percentages, like 30-40% instead of the regular ~15%. One day, I get the call I've been waiting for from my CEO directly.\n\n\"Hey, GTAIVisbest, how are you? Listen, can you explain to me what's going on with the profit percentages lately? Why are we breaking 50% profit at times?\"\n\nI smile, my taught lips tightening into a grin, and I reply to him in a bright voice:\n\n\"Well, sir, [boss's name] told me I was doing the profit calculations wrong\"\n\n\"What do you mean? Explain this, I don't know what's going on.

        "text": "Recently I’ve been binging on this sub, and I finally remembered a particular individual with whom I had the pleasure of attending college, and his nearly artistic execution of malicious compliance. \n\nSo first, a brief bit of background:\n\nI’m ex-military, Reserves, primarily, with some active duty deployment overseas. The college that I attended 10 or 12 years ago was an ROTC college - basically a way for people to play military and graduate with a commission, and at some point I thought it would be a good idea to use ROTC as my method of commissioning. Those of us who were prior service, especially those of us with deployment, combat experience, or extended active duty experience were basically relegated to a specific “hall” in the dorms - away from the rest of the members of our company. We thought, at the time, that it was because we “earned” it, or that the school was trying to give us a bonus. In retrospect, I believe it was really to keep us away from the other cadets. \n\nWe tended to “do our own thing” and most would probably consider us a bad influence on easily impressionable youths who think the military is magical. But I digress. \n\nEnter... well, we’ll call him jones. \n\nJones was a character. Dude was psyops or something - active duty and attending the school to complete some course work related to something he was doing in the military, don’t know, he wouldn’t say exactly, and it was clear that he was far, far more knowledgeable than any of the cadre at the school in most military related subjects. \n\nJones got in trouble a lot (well, we all did...) and one of the standard “punishments” was room arrest - where you were essentially confined to quarters for a period of time, only allowed to exit to go to meals, drill, classes, the library, and the computer labs. \n\nThere was a sheet of paper that would be affixed to your door where you would need to list out your current location and your sign in/our times. \n\nJones had no problem with this. He was on room arrest monthly, more or less. \n\nSo, being a good little “cadet” he filled out his card with 10-digit grid coordinates. As in 1-meter accurate designation for locating someone or something on a map or specialized GPS equipment. \n\nSee, Jones had a very specialized (at the time) GPS device issued by the military that would give him scary accurate GPS positioning, and he’d use that to mark his location on the paper - his exact seat in a classroom, which table at the library he’d be sitting at (he was more or less always at the same one, and would have someone change coordinates for him if necessary), etc. \n\nThe cadre hated it. They couldn’t read at a glance where he was, and to them, that was the whole point of the sign out - quick access to harass, essentially. \n\nSo they brought it up to the hall NCO (an active duty or retired military individual) to have it “fixed”\n\nI remember the response, after much laughter, “it’s absolutely, precisely correct. You have no valid complaints. Get a map.”\n\nEdit: typos \n",

However due to a quirk of the layout there were 2 classrooms that didn't have windows to the outside and as such were the worst rooms. Naturally the new teachers got those.\n\nOne year a newer (and younger) teacher had one of these unfortunate rooms and in the last few month of the year we had a heatwave. His room became a sauna. So one Monday, to beat the heat, he wore Bermuda shorts and a Hawaiian shirt. Now my school didn't have a strict dress code so we students had been wearing shorts for a while now, but teachers generally wore business casual.\n\nHe lasted 1 period before the administration told him to go home and \"wear something appropriate\". Instead he went to a suit rental shop and got a _full_ tuxedo. I'm talking hat, coattails, a cane. He taught the rest of the day in that, I'm sure melting, just to prove a point. I think the administration assumed he got his chuckles in and would go back to normal the next day.\n\nNope. On Tuesday he had a _different_ tuxedo. If memory serves it was bright blue. Wednesday he had another in a different color. Thursday was yet another. Friday he showed up in a tuxedo again and was told to go home until \"he was ready to behave like an adult\".\n\nThat was the end of his run of fancy suits but needless to say he didn't last too long in public education.

        "text": "A little bit of background before we get into the juicy bits. I work at a grocery store as a scanner clerk, which boils down to putting up signs and labels all around the store that display prices and such. Not a hard job, but its tedious. Every week, on Sunday, the new sales go into effect and we scanner clerks have to go to work stupid early to place signs around the entire damn store. Fun stuff. \n\nWhile we do signs and stuff for the store, vendors, or people from a certain company like Coke or Entenmann's \\(they basically come in and put out items that pertain to their company\\) might stop us and ask us to do something for them, or rather, \"hey can you scan this and put this up for me?\". Okay, that's fine, it is our job after all.\n\nWhat we don't like though is when we get vendors who are really nasty to us, those that push us to do their thing right then and there, basically asking us to stop doing our work, which, keep in mind, involves the entire damn store, and go put up a sign or label for them. It especially peeves me when a vendor has a really small display, like the TastyKake Vendor \\(if you're reading this, f\\*ck you\\), who literally has a the bottom shelf of an end cap display, and that's only sometimes. He'd come in and complain about it, saying in broken English \"why there no sign there? I come in every week and there no sign\". Well dude, that's cause we had to take it down 'cause your shit's a different price this week, now be patient cause we have the entire store to change. \n\nBut I digress. Today, one particular vendor, the Entenmann's vendor, had came in to our tiny littler office to complain that his display in the entrance didn't have signs on them. He didn't do this just once, but rather, several times throughout the day \\(my manager says around 20, though I think she might've exaggerated. Oh well, better for the story\\). However, each time I'd go out there, I wouldn't see his display, which is pretty hard to miss as its a giant metal cart thingy. Oh well. \n\nFinally, at the end of our shift, we go back to the office, and our manager is sitting there, with a very clear I'm\\-pissed\\-off face. She tells us that the Entenmann's vendor has came again, this time being a total ass and yelling at them for not putting up signs. She tells us to go out and put signs on them.\n\nWell, you ask for signs, you get signs, dude. The other scanner clerk and I go out and see his display \\(which was finally there\\), and what do we do? We cover the damn thing with signs. The display had so many signs on it that you'd probably knock one off if you wanted to take a box of donuts, but even if that happened, well there plenty more signs where that came from.\n\nWe reported this back to our manager, to which we got a hearty chuckle. Fun stuff.\n\nSadly, we didn't get to see the guy's reaction, as he wasn't there, though I'll be sure to update this if I do hear anything. And if the guy wants more signs, well I promised my manager I'll make an entire curtain of tiny signs, which she stated she'd turn a blind eye to if I did so.",

        "text": "Years ago back in 9th grade I was a fantastic reader but my writing was just okay. I had significant issues with writing in the past so English has usually not been my favorite subject in school. I liked all of my teachers and classes except for one, English class with Ms. Williams.\n\nI had gone to summer school the year before and happened to have her as one of my teachers and had felt uneasy with how rigid she was about school work.  So I wasn't excited to learn she was my teacher. She was also the teacher for honors English so I expected the class would be a bit tougher than necessary. \n\nI ended up having many issues with her as my Teacher throughout the year. Along with adhd and depression I did not do well in her class. She didn't single me out or grade me more harshly than others, but I did not like her teaching style. One memory that sticks out is when we had a four page grammar packet to do for homework. I had understood the 1st, 2nd, and 4th pages and did all of those. At the top of the 3rd page I wrote at the top I don't understand this. She thought I meant I didn't understand the example and explained it then marked off the rest of the page. I guess she thought I skipped the 3rd page to do less homework and understood all of the sentences except for that example? It was one of not a whole lot of times I had remembered my homework, did all that I could understand, and remembered to turn it in. Just for her to mark a page wrong because I didn't understand it. I just felt done. \n\n3/4s of the way through the school year she gave us mandatory extra credit. We were in the computer lab and had to write about something that fit the criteria provided and submit it by the end of class. If our writing was good enough she would give us points for it, either way we still had to write it. Only the five best per class would receive the extra credit. I thought that was fucking stupid. For a lot of students you would know if your writing wouldn't be good enough to qualify before you started. \n\nI decided my topic was why Ms. Williams was a terrible teacher. For each bullet point we had to address for our topic I made sure to give examples that addressed those.\n\nAfter I got home I let my mom know in case we got a call or email from the school. She had known I had trouble with this teacher throughout the year and had talked with the school a few times but was still stunned when I told her what I wrote. After she had read the papers a few days later it was clear Ms. Williams was trying to be nicer so unexpectedly it worked out for the better. ",

I had put everything the company did on Google Drive and I also had the social media passwords etc.  So just before the disciplinary hearing I used Lastpass to change the passwords to as long as possible (Google allows 100 characters) and made them random letters, numbers, symbols with interspersed capitals. \n\nIn my disciplinary I was told I was being fired with 4 week's pay as is standard as long as I followed procedure, including handing over the passwords. So I did.\n\nI copied the passwords into a Google Doc on my phone, changed the font to lobster bold italic, and took screenshots of them (so they couldn't copy and paste), then emailed them to the owners.\n\nNot all of them were 100 characters, but I had to give the passwords for PayPal, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\nThey didn't ask me for the WiFi password as that was still set to the same as when I started, but I did change it along with the router password, and inside the shop is a 4g blackspot. \n\nEdit: to those asking if they could have just reset the passwords....the Google password was linked to what I think was the owner's old number. The social media accounts were recoverable via the a Google email. And they have since updated their social media about 10 days after this happened so they must have got it eventually.\n\nTo those asking if I was an arsehole who deserves to get fired....well I never said I wasn't. But I didn't want to get onto the details of why the owners and I hated each other. But in my eyes, I was in the right, and in theirs they were.",

This happened in the last week. \n\nSo basically, I work hard to provide for my family. I do my job well and always put in 100% to help the place continue running well. I was promoted to supervisor in a small team of counter staff that are there. \n\nOne of the girls, who we will call ShitFace, is very much the laziest and worst worker we have. because I am her supervisor and I am *always* having to fix her mistakes. She is continually messing up orders and we get a lot of complaints about her. She is only 18 and has zero responsibilities (this will be relevant later) and will literally come up with ridiculous reasons to have the weekend off. \n\nTo give you a bit of context, she has actually lied about a family member dying to get a night off work. We found out this was a lie because she slipped up. She lied about being pregnant and having a miscarriage. We found out this was a lie because someone reverse searched the pregnancy test image and it came from google. \n\nShe is seeing one of the staff members that works with us and will use ANY excuse not to do her work, so she can go through the back and see him. This obviously causes a lot of conflicts. So basically, she's an absolutely terrible employee and doesn't do her job very well.\n\nShe has been complaining to the boss that she doesn't have enough hours (you know, even though she's always trying to skip working!). I am full time, she is part time. Because of her constant moaning, my boss gave in to her and requested that I cut my hours down to 30 to let her have more. My boss is *always* taking her side because she's young and threatens to leave if she doesn't get her way, and honestly it's becoming very frustrating having to deal with it all the time.\n\nSo they want me to cut my hours down to 30? How about I cut them right down to 16, I will work part time and she can work full time. But... this means she will also have to work 7 days a week because of how our days off work around each other. I can't possibly be there to cover her days off (mid week) if I'm only working the weekends doing 16 hours can I? So how about that, bitch, enjoy working 7 days a fucking week and getting your own way. And boss, enjoy trying to find cover when she calls in sick.\n\nTLDR: shit employee wanted to take hours off me just to spite me, so I reduced them right down to part time so she would have to work 7 days. \n\n",

        "text": "A hundred years or so ago, I used to work at a movie theater that was \"down at heel\" compared to other movie houses, but we made fresh popcorn better than others. It was kind of the only thing I had as a point of pride. As anyone who has ever made popcorn in any device knows, not all kernels pop. In a commercial kettle, not only do all kernels not pop, but you can sometimes get pieces of popcorn stuck under the wire that stirs the kernels as they cook and it will burn to charcoal. That's why there's a little platform with a grate on it when you dump the kettle. You sift the bad stuff out over the grate and whisk the tasty-hot fresh stuff over onto the pile in the deeper bin, which is heated. \nSo I had just finished sifting a batch and started a new one cooking when a woman came up and ordered a small *fresh* popcorn. I was proud to tell her I had just made it fresh and was scooping it into the canister for her. She said no, she wanted it right out of the kettle. She was firm and very slightly pissy, but I wasn't bothered because I'm kind of particular myself. It didn't change my wage to make it for her, and if she was willing to wait...why not?\n\nSo, 7 minutes later, it's time to dump the popcorn and I started sifting out all the bad so she could have an enjoyable serving of popcorn. She became annoyed and (I was maybe 17 and she was maybe in her 60s, but kind of turned into a baby) and whined, \"You're making it cold!!!\" I tried to helpfully tell her I was sifting it, and it's what we do with all of it. \"She was practically doing a pee-pee dance and was fussing at me and demanding, \"I want it right out of the kettle.\" [Now, ordinarily I have a terrible character flaw that I often like to prevent people from experiencing disaster, at a popularity cost to myself.] In this case, I generously and immediately complied with her wishes. Scooped up all of the unsifted popcorn, burnt pieces, and tons of deadly, molar-snapping, un-popped kernels and told her \"Here it is, right from the kettle, just like you wanted.\" If she brought it back with a complaint, I don't recall. I didn't get in any trouble over it.",

        "text": "A little background. The site I worked at for the client had a swipe card system. When you show up in the morning, you swipe in, and when you leave for the day, you swipe out. The site is old, some of the machines don't always work, you hold up the wrong card from your multiple badges, it will still beep, making you think you swiped. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe swiping was always preached to be about safety. It was a large site, and they wanted to know if you were on site or working in that building in case there was an emergency of some sorts and they could tell if you were there or not. Now anyone with any common sense knows this is for big brother to watch your hours, but never preached that way.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEverything was fine, I worked lots of hours. Lost count how many times I came in slightly early, stayed late, etc. swiping away. But then management decides that swiping needs to be looked at closer. You stayed an extra 1 hour yesterday but left 16 min early today. Explain why you left early! Not caring that you put in extra hours all week. If you left a second early, they harped on you. Fine, whatever, continue to work away, learning what they let slide for leaving \"early\". Well now this being an old site, sometimes the network didn't record, the machine wouldn't record, etc. Everyone knows I was there, working my standard hours plus extras all the time. One day, I am told my swiping needs to be better. I defend it with IT tickets on the machines etc. Doesn't matter, there is another machine by the other door, I can use that one. Alright I can use other machines and I can swipe better! Tell management I can do better.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne thing the client doesn't mention (but I knew) is if your swipes matched your timesheets, your company would automatically get paid. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm annoyed, but their site so got to follow the rules. I think back to my orientations, safety meetings, all the jazz they throw at us. Review the booklets etc. Everything about swiping is for safety, so they know where you are working and if you are on site in case of an emergency.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe next day I get to work and swipe in like a good employee. Get to work. I am asked by one of my boss's to go to town and pick something up. Sure no problem. I swipe out as I am not on site anymore (we would never swipe multiple times, just once in the morning, once at end of day), and want to ensure I follow safety procedures. I go to town grab the item and bring it back to the other office where it was going. Well I swiped in there as I am back on site. Deliver the package, talk with the coworkers for a bit. Head off to go back to my original office. Oh, I am not working at this office, better swipe out and swipe in at my office I am working at. A few hours later, I get asked to cover the rest of the day at the third office location. Yup, no problem. Since I am switching offices, and for safety so they know which building I am in, I swipe out, and go to the new location and swipe in again. Finish off the day and swipe out. I had my fun for the day.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA couple of days later, I see one of the bosses working with the client to figure out some swipes. The system had messed up on an employee and they couldn't tell if they were coming or going as the system had recorded too many swipes on one day and some double swipes hours apart. They system ending up reversing the following days, so it essentially looked like I was working night shift now. Took them a couple days to sort out the system, and get my time back to normal. I am questioned why I swiped so much that day. I just quote the safety talks and procedures for verbatim back at them. Boss looks at me and calls me a *bleeping bleep*. Half laughing. Then says just swipe once in the morning and once at the end of day. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother coworker looks at me later in the day as we are leaving and asks why I did that? I was told I had to be better at swiping and it was for safety. Coworker looks at me, laughing saying you just did that to piss them off. I just smiled from ear to ear as I walked out forgetting to swipe. Not a word was ever said to me again about being better at swiping. \n",

One of the owners played soft ball in a rec league and I would often come in halfway through second shift and then work third shift afterwards so that he could go play softball.\n\nI play rugby and a few times I was scheduled while the local team I was playing for would have pick-up games.  I always got my time covered by a coworker (about an 2.5 hours) and then I would return after to finish up the shift.      I never had any trouble getting covered because I was always picking up shifts for people and covering when someone called in sick.  A few times I even stayed at work an extra half hour off the clock to help if they were busy giving them free labor to make the transition run smoothly.\n\nAfter this happened a few times the owner for whom I had covered pulled me aside and angrily told me I would no longer be allowed to get part of a shift covered.  His reasoning was that the people who I got to cover for me had to be told the specials for the week, (4 types of tamales and 1 type of burrito) and that took up too much time, even though they would have had to be told eventually and the specials were sometimes mentioned in the weekly email.\n\nI was pretty surprised by his attitude especially considering I had given them free labor and had covered for him in the past but he was one of the bosses so I said I understood.\n\nTwo days later he texts me and asks me to cover half his shift.  I politely declined.  ",

Firstly, my team is new to the department the company decided after 20 years of no new blood to swap out all their experienced staff for new trainees. As we learn the role work has gotten behind.\n\nSecondly, they moved where we all sat in the building even more recently without any IT support on hand for the move. \n\nSo a few weeks ago, after the floor move, I was the person in the department competent enough to sort out people's IT issues that's were arising. Most were 5 minute max fixes getting things like programs installed, or setting up the 3 monitor system we use properly.\n\nWell on the second day I had to swap two cables over to get something to work, this is when officious twat (OT) sees me and collars me when I'm done. OT is the same level as me, but is somewhat of an assistant to the department manager.\n\nOT, sits next to me and starts berating me, for helping people, that I'd been away from my desk for 30 minutes (actually somewhere between 5-7), and that our work load is too high, that I'm not to help anyone more, and that I must do only my job. Until we're back on track (which will take months anyway) As well as serval other unpleasant things.\n\nAfter telling him he was grossly inappropriate, a new plan forms in my head. I realise at this point I'm technically working over time. I have no compulsion to be there. So I pack up my stuff and leave till my shift starts. Which completely pisses him off. From that point on I refuse every single help request citing OT and his instructions. Telling people they'll have to phone our IT services which takes a minimum of 20 minutes each time. Whilst also taking every single minute of every break I'm entitled too that I would never normally take. For a full week, work to rule is in effect and I'm joined by several colleagues. And that week my work decreased by about 30%.\n\nWhen it gets to Monday I arrive to see an email about the sudden spike in time logged calling IT for Help and laugh, but when the department manager calls a meeting to see why the work we've done has suddenly slowed down, and why we're now even more behind despite all the overtime offered, I actually belly laughed at my email. \n\nWe get there and  people start speaking up. As I sit in the background smiling. OT, is sitting going red with rage as he realises he's caused this and storms out. When the meeting is done, the department manager sidles up to me and quietly asks me to get back to helping people, and OT went home that day in a huff and I've just been nominated for an award for all the help I've given. And OT will never come for me again, after grovelling an apology the next day. ",

There were a lot of little stories from that place that I'm just now rendering as I recap this particular incident, so you might hear more from me about this place later.\n\n\nNow, as a kid (and even now), I loved to drink chocolate milk. One of my earliest sentences was \"I want chocolate milk.\" That's how much I loved it. And this daycare I went to took place in the cafeteria, where we would stand in line to get our snacks.\n\n\nI would get me some chocolate milk and just guzzle it as happy as can be. Soon, I'd run out, as natural as can be. Well, they had all that chocolate milk in the cafeteria, why not try to get some more? Most of the cafeteria ladies working liked me- I was a sweet kid after all- and load me up with another carton of the good stuff.\n\n\nHowever, there were a few that weren't so easy going, and would gleefully deny me what I felt was rightfully mine. \"No dman2life, you can't have any more money! If we give it to you, then the other kids won't have any. You'll have to wait until snack time is over. We'll put the leftovers on a table so you kids can have more.\"\n\n\nNow, this sounds perfectly reasonable until you realize they had a ton of leftovers. There would be about 20 drinks left over at the end. Maybe one or two would be snatched up by a few kids, but that was it.\n\n\nSo, I'd get my second one about that time, and promptly teleported it into the deep recesses of the bottomless pit known as a young boy's stomach. However, merely two chocolate milks would not sustain me. No, I wanted, NEEDED more.\n\n\nI tried to grab a third, and was scolded for it. \"You've had two dman2life! Don't be greedy. You have to wait until everyone is done if you want any more. Don't let me catch you doing this again, or else you'll be banned from getting more every again.\"\n\n\nI was furious. However, I was also smart. I went to every kid there. Every single one. I asked them all \"Are you done? Do you want any more chocolate milk?\" And if they wanted some, they'd tell me, and I'd get them one. I may have given out another two or three, but there were easily 9 left at the end of this, and every kid was happy.\n\n\nI drank all 9 of those chocolate milks, staring at the cafeteria lady the entire time. She watched me with disbelief written all over her face. It was glorious. It was wonderful. It was perfect. \n\n\nI threw up.",

Ate lunch at my desk in 15 minutes instead of a full lunch break. \n\nWithin a few months,  I caught up on the previous person's backlog. And because I instituted some more efficient systems, the job that wasn't being completed in 60 hours by the previous employee, was getting done in 45 or 50. \n\nAfter a month of straightening and cleaning, rearranging files on Friday afternoons, I literally had nothing to do.  I asked for more work.  Nothing to do. \n\nSo one week, my son had a school event and I asked if I could leave one hour early on Friday. \n\nI was told by the office manager that, \"You are paid to work at least 8 hours a day, even if you have 40 hours by noon Friday, you still need to work your full 8 hours on Friday.  You can come in early on Friday so you can leave early, but you need 8 hours\"\n\nI explained that I'd been working  10 hours a day every day, and I didn't think it was unreasonable to ask for 1 hour on a Friday, especially when my work was done by noon anyway. \n\nShe didn't care. \nSo, I came in early on Friday, and left early. \n\nThat was the last time I came in early.  And after that, I never I stayed late. \n\nI literally watched my clock and dropped everything when I reached 8 hours.  I took my full lunch break.  \n\nWithin a few weeks, everything was late.  My boss called me in, and I explained the situation and that it could be worse without all the efficiencies I instituted. \n\nHe agreed that the job was a 60- hour job that I could finish in 45, so I got a small raise, and the overtime solution ended up being that if I had to work extra hours, I would be compensated 2x my effective hourly wage.  And, if my job was done, I could leave early. \n\nThis also started the downfall of the manager.  A couple months later, the other 4 employees got fed up with her enough to call a group meeting with boss, resulting in manager getting fired.\n \n",

Every customer is asked if they want paper or plastic and that's how you bag. \n\nThis particular customer wanted paper bags. Ok, no problem. So I'm ringing up her items and get to her meat items. She has a lot of meat and all the packages are a bit sticky from one of the packages leaking. I finally find the culprit, chicken breasts. I informed the lady the package was leaking and asked if she wanted another one but she wanted that package. Ok then. So I scanned it and put the leaking chicken breasts in a plastic bag and then put that in a paper bag. That was a huge mistake apparently.\n\nShe started yelling that I wasn't bagging her groceries correctly and started unpacking ALL the bags because she couldn’t trust that I had packed the rest correctly. I tried to explain why I put the chicken in a plastic bag instead of immediately in a paper bag but she wasn't having any of it. The cashier manager eventually came over and, since the customer is always right, I was told to repack all the bags using only paper. So I repacked everything using only paper. Important note about the chicken: it was one of those huge family sized packages so it was too big to lay flat inside a paper bag. When put it into a paper bag, it sits in a slanted position... which means all the juices run to the lower end. I know what happens when paper gets wet but hey, she made it crystal clear that she only wanted paper...\n\nA short while after she left, she came back and stormed in right up to my register yelling incoherently. She threw a torn, wet paper bag on the belt area containing a busted package of chicken breast. What I did understand amidst all her yelling was that, unsurprisingly, the bottom of the bag tore open when she was unloading the car. Her car was a sticky mess, too (it was summer). The same manager came back over to deal with her. I wish this is where I could say the manager was cool and told her to piss off and she got exactly what she asked for... but the manager was a bitch herself and didn’t do any of that. The manager ended up giving the lady a refund and a free package of chicken. After I wrung up the new package of chicken I stepped aside to let the manger override the sale to make it free and I did what any good cashier does, I turned to the lady and asked her “Paper or Plastic?”. She just grabbed the chicken and stormed out. ",

        "text": "This story happened almost 20 years ago, but when my wife brought it up last night at the dinner table and I told our daughters the story, I immediately thought of this subreddit. It's not one of those stories where someone loses their job or gets in huge trouble, but it is the very definition of malicious compliance. I’ll try to keep this short but it’s the details that make it funny.\n\nAt the time this took place, I was in college. Both my roommate and I were nearing graduation but we stayed in the dorms because it was cheaper and easier than living off-campus. As a result, we were easily the oldest residents of our house. Now when I say “house,” let me explain. Our dorm was the largest dorm on campus. The building itself was five stories tall, but was also very long and snaked its way around a large parking lot. This meant that each floor of the building was separated into “houses” of maybe 30 rooms apiece. The houses were all men-only or women-only, but there was no real point to that since there was no physical barrier between houses. So if you lived at the end of your house, you might be right next door to a room that had the opposite gender living in it. Not true co-ed, but close enough.\n\nIt’s also important to understand that each house had its own restroom. Think of a large public restroom with many toilets, urinals, showers and sinks. When I started college the restroom doors were unlocked at all times and people could freely move in and out. A year or so before this story takes places there was an incident, however, where someone trashed a house’s restroom. Just demolished it, lots of damage. The residents of that house swore up and down that they didn’t do it and it was some drunk person from outside the house. As a result, next semester the doors to every restroom were locked at all times and each house resident was issued a key to their house restroom. Cue many, many instances of people walking halfway to the restroom only to remember they forgot their key and having to walk back to their room and get it.\n\nSo now that we have some context, let’s proceed. My girlfriend (now wife) would come up and visit me at school. We were on the fourth floor, which meant that any time she had to go to the bathroom she technically was supposed to walk three floors down to the lobby. Either that or walk two houses down to the nearest female house (maybe 1500 ft.) and try to get one of the girls to let her in their restroom. From the beginning I just offered her my restroom key and told her to go in ours, but she back then was very mild-mannered and didn’t like breaking any rules whatsoever, so she initially refused. I should point out, this was a somewhat common practice to just walk into the restroom and find someone of the opposite sex coming out of a stall or washing their hands. Everything was sectioned off so there was no risk of accidentally exposing yourself or being exposed to someone else. It wouldn’t have been weird at all for her to go in there, it happened all the time.\n\nAfter several trips downstairs to use the public restroom, she finally gave in and just took my key. After a while she got completely comfortable with it. She’d just grab the key, run in to use the toilet, and head back. One day she heads into the restroom and right after she comes back to our room, the RA (resident assistant) comes in. Apparently he was in there using a urinal when my girlfriend walked in, so he followed her back to the room to address this “situation.” The RA was a bit of a milquetoast as it was, while both my roommate and I are both polite but are definitely natural leaders. Also remember how I said my roommate and I were the oldest residents in the house? So he’s standing there almost stammering while he tries talking to a couple of guys who are several years older than him, are way more experienced in dorm life, and who obviously don’t care about this situation at all. I remember feeling kind of bad for him since there was no reason for him to feel nervous.\n\nHe only spoke a couple of sentences, but it ended with “Understand that I’ll have to report this incident to the dorm manager.” Now I’m a big fan of simple responses to people that are out of their element or on a stupid power trip. In this case the kid was just doing his job and he wasn’t being a jerk about it or anything. So I just shrugged, and said, “Ok.”\n\nA day or two later I get called down to the dorm manager’s office. She was probably around 30, a nice enough lady to be honest. She explains in a somewhat stern manner that this was a big problem (it wasn’t) and it needed to be addressed (it didn’t). She told me that I was to create a couple of signs for the restroom doors. The signs were to 1) say that women were not allowed in the restroom and 2) that I was sorry. At this point, I’ve crossed the line from being rather ambivalent about the whole situation to being annoyed. But she was clearly trying to flex her muscles and wanted me to put on a sad, sorry-I’m-in-trouble face about the whole thing. Sorry, I just wasn’t born with that gene.\n\nI looked her right in the eye, and with no emotion, said, “Ok.” \n\nIn this type of situation, where the person is trying to scold you for something stupid but has no intention of really doing anything, I always do this. I also always hold the eye contact for several seconds afterwards. It’s important to show no emotion externally. I love to watch their face because usually the type of person who does this sort of thing is just trying to flex their power, but they’re either not really in power or, more likely, they’re on the stupid end of the argument. As in, yes, you’re technically correct but we both know this doesn’t matter so why are you making a big deal about it? So when you don’t put on the puppy dog eyes and make like you’re a bad boy or girl, you can see their thoughts flash across their face. It’s like a mix of “he’s not responding like I thought he would, should I scold him some more to show him who’s boss?” and “wait, what’s happening? Is he about to flip out on me?” Almost always they break eye contact first. I suppose it’s a jerk thing to do, but again, I find it hilarious.\n\nI left her office and went up to my room to get started on these signs. In huge font it said, “I APOLOGIZE.” Then immediately below that in tiny font it said “But women are not allowed in this restroom.” Below that in medium sized font it explained the truth, which is that guests could either walk three floors down or go two houses over and try to find a female resident with a key. Then followed a line saying, “Please apologize to your female guests on my behalf.” Lastly, I found some random quote off the internet about how stupid it was that people were so concerned with separate restrooms. I don’t still have the signs of course, but here’s a quick mockup of what it looked like: [https://imgur.com/atGV57s](https://imgur.com/atGV57s)\n\nI put up the signs on the restroom doors and said nothing to anyone about them. It wasn’t exactly a huge event in the house, don’t get me wrong, but I did enjoy a couple of times when I left for class and saw a few people gathered around talking about the signs. Only a single day passed before there was a voicemail left for me on my phone and the signs were missing. I was to report back to the dorm manager’s office that afternoon. At the appointment time, I walked in and sat down. She held up the sign and asked what it was all about. I said, “You asked me to make a sign apologizing and to say that women weren’t allowed in the restroom.”\n\nShe responded with, “You know this isn’t what I meant.”\n\nThen followed 5-10 minutes of back and forth discussion where she made it clear she wasn’t happy and I made it clear that I thought this whole thing was a waste of time. In fairness to her, she didn’t yell or get belligerent, she just had an attitude the whole time of, “Why won’t this little piss-ant do what I tell him?” The whole meeting ended with her saying that she wouldn’t write me up for a formal reprimand as long as I made new signs. The signs were **only** to say that women aren’t allowed in the restroom, nothing else, and with **no** special formatting whatsoever.\n\nI looked her right in the eye, and said, “Ok.” \n\nBack in my room, I fired up Word. I started a new document and simply typed “Women are not allowed in this restroom.” I centered the text on the page, after some internal debate about whether that counted as “special formatting.” Then I hit print and posted the signs. Notice I didn’t say anything about increasing the font size. After all, she said no special formatting, right? Back then Word’s default text was Arial size 10. So you ended up with a sheet of paper with gigantic margins and comparatively tiny text in the middle, like this: [https://imgur.com/aEGVYYQ](https://imgur.com/aEGVYYQ)\n\nI waited for another phone call or voicemail, but alas, apparently I had followed her directions close enough. The signs stayed up for the remainder of the year. In the next few weeks I saw several girls look at the sign and smirk as they used their boyfriend’s keys to go into the restroom.\n\nEdit: I sent this story to my college roommate and asked if he remembered the incident. He said, \"Yes, but wasn't the default text size 12 back then?\" You can always count on that guy to focus on the right details...",

        "text": "So about a year ago the grocery store I work at decided to hire a new assistant manager, I don't really know anything about her except for the fact that she was transferred over from another store. Now I'm in college at the moment and use this job to make some money, help my parents if they're ever strapped for cash, and to pay off my car, It's not the most important job I think I'll ever have. So one day this new assistant manager asks me to take out all of the trash, which is easy enough and it helps kill 2-2.5 hours usually. \n\nDoing the trash is common sense for the most part, for example we're supposed to use gloves or make sure to wash our hands when we finish, unless you're cleaning out the register garbage. For the registers you're supposed to take all of it, put it in a bag, and throw it in the closet in case someone loses a receipt or something is thrown out by accident.\n\nAnd so I began the garbage, put it in the closet, and went on my way to finish the rest of the store. Until I heard someone yelling my name...\n\nSM (Stupid Manager): Realtgreat! What are you doing? The only trash that goes in there is the bookroom garbage.\n\nAE (Asshole Employee [me]): Are you sure about that? No one told me anything about that.\n\nSM: Yes, I'm sure! Now take that to the compactor!\n\nIn an attempt to make her happy I decided to listen even though I knew she was wrong, but whatever it's a stupid job and I could not care less about it anyway.\n\nUntil the next time I did the trash at least, this time she caught me and instead of talking to me about it like a normal person she decided to yell at me about it, in front of the whole sales floor... She even called the manager, who she is an assistant for, to tell me exactly what should be done.\n\nShe calls the manager, tells her I'm putting trash in the closet, and hands me the phone. \n\nRM (Real Manager): Well, as long as there isn't to much garbage, putting it in the closet is fine.\n\nAE: Okay, I completely understand.\n\nAnd so I listened, every time I did the trash I would take the register garbage and throw it in to compactor. New people were hired, they were taught how to do the trash, and then they would notice me throw the register trash in the compactor even though they were just told to leave it in the closet.\n\nFor about 3-4 months I did just as I was told, left the closet clear of trash (unless it was coming from the bookroom ofcourse), and then the real manager saw me taking the register trash to the compactor... \n\nRM: Realtgreat, where are you taking that garbage?\n\nAE: To the compactor, why?\n\nRM: You know it belongs in the closet, right? \n\nAE: Yeah, but SM wants it in the compactor and she gets angry with me when I put it anywhere else. So I'm listening to her and not putting it in the closet.\n\nRM: Okay, I understand.\n\nAnother few weeks go by and I'm still doing exactly as I was told by the amazing assistant manager, and then while doing the trash on a seemingly random day SM comes up to me and quietly says: um... you.. uh... can throw that in the closet.\n\nThe moment I've been waiting for had finally come, and I couldn't be happier. All I said to her was: Are you sure? I mean you did specifically tell me, on multiple occasions, that it belongs in the back.",
