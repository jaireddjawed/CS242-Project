        "text": "So a little background. I am a teen who wears a mask out in public. I'm vaccinated, caught covid twice, so I have all the antibodies or what have you. I get sick fairly often, so I try to prevent getting sick. Nowadays you don't see many people wearing masks. So yes, I am \"weird\" and \"different\" and it is not something you see everyday. And, I could care less honestly, I have always never fit in. But I will admit half the time it is annoying that wherever you go there's someone staring at you. You would think I'm wearing a bright neon sign saying \"HEY, LOOK AT ME!!!!\" But I digress. Most learn at a fairly young age not to stare. Most look and then stop, which is fine. But when you stare and don't stop, then it's an issue. Of course kids are understandable, as they're kids. But when you're an adult staring at teen, who is minding their business might I add, then as stated that is an issue. \n\nI can make and keep eye contact for a while. And I can go  an uncomfortable amount of time without blinking. Usually over 45 seconds. All I have to do is make my eyes big, and presto! They notice that I'm staring at them, or as some of my friends say I'm staring into their souls. As I've done staring contests, or I'll accidentally stare at them without meaning to lol. Anyways, always within 5 secs they stop. If I'm feeling more petty I'll stare and won't stop for a solid 15 secs. I always find the latter amusing as they're embarrassed and will do everything in their power to avoid eye contact. \n\nWell thanks for reading mate! Stay safe and have a good one!",

        "text": "Basically this all started when I went to a new school and I had some new friends I had met. they were already in an established friend group so I just was an added member who didn't really know everyone well and just talked to a few of them really.\n\nLong story short I left them because of the way they acted towards me and found new friends. Then we started actually beefing with one another and this one girl (we'll call her Mary) decided to cuss me out of no where. I didn't even talk to her so I have no clue why she started shit at all. So whatever we went back and forth that day and it was over with.\n\n2 months later one of my friends is friends with the friend group Mary is in and they also things going on but suggested that we should work it out. I didn't really want to but for the sake of my real friends I did. They asked me what was going on with me and Mary and I told them exactly how I felt. The girl took it as another opportunity to try and cuss me again. So we went back and forth. Next day tried to solve things with another friend who had a problem with someone In that friend group, and guess what Mary took it upon herself to cuss me again but this time brought it upon herself to get her friends to join in and brutally body shame me and call me obese and ugly.\n\nSome words were already said by me to her but I wasn't satisfied. I couldn't let this slide. So the next day I went and started a rumor about her that she's works under payed at her parents restaurant and that she has to go out and beg people to come which technically wasn't untrue it was just that she didn't want people to know. also posted some nasty pictures I have of her on my story for lots a people to see. Then after that I went and told one person in her friend group that I overheard her say something bad about their entire group just to add to the fire since she already didn't like her. \n\nMary and friends were already toxic as it is so it didn't take long for all of them to drop her and for her to start and get bullied by others. Still, it didn't really satisfy me so for the last thing I had drinks they sold at school at my own home so I decided to wait until I had class with her and made sure no one was looking and set it there. I then went at the very end of school hours to go to one of the assistant principals and report her for \"stealing\" and to make sure and not mention my name in anything.\nHalfway though school the next day she was gone. I assume that my plan worked because after that day didn't see her at school for a while.\n\nThat's basically it I don't and will never feel bad about it. She's friendless now so she will never gain the confidence again to try and cuss me ever again. I don't even know how anyone hadn't linked me with anything yet.",

        "text": "My next door neighbors have rubbed me the wrong way ever since I moved here 3 years ago. The husband (let’s call him Mike) struck me as a little sleazy, and the wife (we’ll call her Sharon) seemed nosy and judgemental as hell. But I know myself, I know I’m quick to judge and get stuck in a certain opinion of people. My daughter is about the same age as theirs (and let’s call her Maria) and she has a bit of trouble making friends, so when Sharon suggested they have weekly play dates, alternating between their house and mine, I put my dislike of her aside and agreed.\r\n\r\nIt all seemed to be going fine for a while, but my daughter eventually seemed less enthusiastic about going over to their place. I talked to her about it and she admitted she didn’t like Sharon. Apparently Sharon had been watching them play and directing them on how to play, and she often interrupted to ask my daughter intrusive questions about our family, especially about my kids’ paternity. My daughter is a picky eater, so to start with I would send her over with snacks I know she can eat in case there was nothing there she could eat. My daughter had told me she didn’t need those snacks because they had food there she could eat, but it turns out Sharon had told her she was being rude for bringing her own food to someone else’s house, and if she wanted to eat she had to eat what Sharon gave her, so of course she just didn’t eat there. On top of that, Sharon would invite my daughter to Sunday School every time, and had gotten very pushy even though she consistently said no.\r\n\r\nMy daughter still wanted to play with Maria, so we decided the playdates could continue, but only if they were at our place. I made my excuses to Sharon and initially she agreed to only have play dates at my house. But when Sharon and Maria showed up, they both came inside instead of Sharon leaving Maria at the door as usual. In front of her daughter, my daughter, and my son, Sharon said they’d been praying about it as a family and god had guided them and told them not to leave their daughter with an unmarried mother because apparently it shows I can’t make good choices and they’re worried I would influence her to make poor decisions with her life and stray from her faith. And then they left. \r\n\r\nSo, I was right about Sharon being nosy and judgemental. I decided to find out if I was right about Mike. I made accounts on instagram and facebook posing as an attractive young lady with lots of somewhat local friends, I followed him on instagram, he followed back. He immediately messaged me, and the messages quickly went from vaguely flirty to obviously trying to get some. I then took screenshots of the messages and sent them to Sharon in a Facebook message. I didn’t get a response, but I did see Mike storming out of the house with a small suitcase and driving off rather recklessly. He did come back a couple of days later, so I haven’t destroyed their marriage or anything, but I definitely put a dent in it.",

The village hired an administrator to go after building owners to enforce property codes, etc. \n\nA while later, I received a notice that my house is in violation of village ordnance(s). Nothing stated what was out of compliance. I followed up with the village administrator and all I was told, is the street view of the home needed improvements. I asked for specifics and was not told any. I did nothing and a few weeks pass. Received a second noncompliance notice, with no specifics once more. This one threatened financial punishment. I once again seek direct statements of what was being found out of compliance. The administrator guessed it had to do with chipped paint on the wood siding (home was built in the late 1800s). Talking with a building owner on the same block, they had to change their store fronts to a color on the \"accepable color\" list from what they just painted two weeks prior. I read the list and saw only a few acceptable colors on it. I decided to prime my yellow colored house with white primer.  The administrator stopped by and talked down to me while i was prepping to prime. I was angry. I primed half of my street-viewed house side white and left the back half yellow. Basically, directly in half. I put away all of the scaffolding and paint items. Weeks go by and the administrator came by to follow-up on the remainder of the painting. I showed them that the paint was indeed \"fixed\" so cars parking in front of my house no longer saw chipped paint. They pointed out that only did the front half and that it did not match the remainder of the house. I chuckled and pointed out that both colors are on the approved color list. I left it that way for three years until the administrator moved on to a different role, outside of the village. Then i painted it back yellow to match the remainder of the home.",

My roommates came home later and put a box of pizza on the shelf smushing my cake against the back of the fridge making a huge mess of frosting on the wall and ruining my cake. When i confronted them no one apologized, instead they blamed me for leaving a piece of cake in foil on an empty shelf that they wanted to put the pizza. Okay i guess we aren't looking where we put stuff... A few days later they were bringing in groceries and i saw a big box of drumsticks ice cream cones get put into the freezer. I figured it was a good time for me to go shopping too so i went and got a huge 2 gallon bucket of neapolitan ice cream and otherheavy freezer stuff. When i got back i shoved it all into the freezer smushing the box of drumsticks against the wall and breaking all the cones. Later that day they knocked on my door super angry but i just told them what they told me. \"You shouldn't have put your ice cream on an empty shelf, my ice cream goes there\" They wanted me to pay back the ice cream but i told them to replace my cake first and of course that didn't happen. It was funny seeing them eat crushed ice cream cones from a bowl the next week. Don't ruin my food!",

Things like put in double paned-windows, and new coat of paint, take down porches that were falling apart and other minor issues.  Our town put a stop work order on him and took him to court because the houses were “historic”.  All he was allowed to do was do minor safety repairs on the porches and paint the houses in a manner appropriate to their era.  Well he did some research and found that colonial houses could be all sorts of colors so he painted (what used to be tasteful white homes) them orange, lime green and puke yellow.  The town took him to court again but he was able to show proof that that wasn’t unusual for colonial era home in our area, so it was thrown out of court and the town lived with garish colors on Main Street until the town gave him permission to do the upgrades he requested.",

He seemed in a rush, like he was already late for something else so he needed to do his shopping quickly. He bumped my trolley going past me, not a word of apology out of his mouth.\n\nA minute later I hadn't moved as I was looking around the shelves, he came past again, same thing. Another 5 minutes later I was in a different section and this time he scrapped my leg with his trolley, it hurt little. He again didn't say a word to me\n I yelled at him, \"oi\". He just yelled back \"I already said I was sorry\" in a tone that gave of a just get off my case kind of vibe. \n\nI saw a chance for some petty revenge when I saw him coming for a checkout. I raced and beat him into the line. I said in a sarcastic tone, \"I'm sorry for being faster then you, you can't be in that much of a rush if I can beat your sorry ass to the checkouts.\"\n\nHe got angry and huffed and puffed at me, hurling Insults and abuse as he now blamed me for making him late. I'm like good, badge of honour for me. He huffed and puffed more as he had to join the back of a longer line, others at this point were behind me. \n\nThis made my day in the end. Sweet, sweet petty revenge.",

        "text": "Every two weeks I take my family's clothes to the laundromat near our house. It's in a mostly abandoned strip mall, with abundant parking and large carts you can use for your laundry. Since I had 4 very large bags, I had to do it in two trips to the car. After loading the first two washers, I took the cart back out to my car to get the next 2 bags, only to find that a man was parking his car right in front of the only curb cut from the sidewalk into the parking lot (also a fire lane). I waved at him and said \"excuse me, do you mind finding another place to park? This is the only curb cut to the parking lot and I need to use it for my laundry cart\" \"no, I'm parking here\" \"there are plenty of other parking spaces- two right there at the front (literally the first spots in those aisles), it would only be about 5 extra steps\" \"I'm not moving\" \"I'm sorry but I really am not able to lift a full cart back up and over the curb\" (5'2\" woman, not strong at all) \"look, I'm not moving my car. There's space in front of me, figure it out yourself\" He got out of the car to go inside (with his single, half full laundry bag). I really struggled getting the cart back into the laundromat with my laundry, but was finally able to lift it up and over the curb, almost hitting his car twice in the process. \n\nI take the last giant load washer and load my clothes in. As I'm finishing up and starting the washer, I look around for a final washer to use. At the same time, here comes the car guy rolling a cart down the aisle I'm in, pausing his cart between two empty washers, one stating out of order. And then... He leaves his cart there and goes over to the card machine to load money onto his card. It's literally the last larger washer, so... I nudge his cart out of the way and start loading the rest of my clothes in.  This guy EXPLODES at me when he comes back, calling me all sorts of names, asking where my INTEGRITY is, blah blah blah. Goes on and on about basic respect and decency 🙄. Tells me that since I'm a \"female\" I think I can get away with it, but he is going to get his sister to beat the shit out of me (lmao, sister, really?). I start the washer as the guy comes back after tattling to management about my \"stealing\". All I say to the manager was \"sorry, no one was there. I didn't take any clothes out or touch any of his belongings\". Manager goes and gets him two of the much smaller washers to use. I did feel bad about getting management involved, so I went to apologize to them later and explain the situation, and gave them the cost of the two washers. I had been planning to do grocery shopping while my laundry was drying, but I decided it was best to stay with all my laundry after that cause I didn't know what this guy would try. I am NOT a confrontational person and this encounter shook me up a bit, but I just couldn't help myself. Some people these days....",

        "text": "This took place my senior year in high school 1986 - 1987. The people in this story include: me (F) age 18, my male cousin age 10, my youngest sister age 9 and our neighbors. For the story, I'll call my cousin C. The neighbor family included the mom (probably late 40s), two early 20s sons (who were dealing marijuana, which was an illegal drug then, this will be important) and a son and daughter just younger than myself. The setting, we lived in identical houses. The two homes were built into a hill. Our house was 3 foot higher on the hill than their house and the area between our homes was narrow, only 8 - 10 feet wide. There was a retaining wall that was about three foot high that held back the hill on their side and stopped at ground level on our side, since we were higher on the hill. \n\nI shared a bedroom with my youngest sister. We had a bunk bed. Our bedroom window lined up to their back porch and when their porch light was on the light flooded our room. We didn't have enough room for C to have his own bed, but he lived with us. We had come to an odd arrangement. Sunday through Thursday night he used my bed and I slept on the couch. I had to be up earlier than my youngest sister, or C, for school. Then Friday and Saturday night I slept in my bed and C slept on the couch.\n\nThe problem we had was that our drug dealing neighbors had people coming to their home at all hours of the day and night. They had a very bright bulb for their back door porch and when it was on at night it filled our room with light. We tried talking to the mom, but if she turned the light off it was promptly turned back on. We tried covering the window with a heavy blanket and the light was very intense around the edges of the blanket. Honestly, the light made our shared room feel like we were sleeping in full daylight! This light was on 24/7, so all three of us were seriously affected!\n\nOur cousin, C, my sister and I were fed up and we started trying to think of creative solutions, some were silly, but we hit upon a plan! We had a good idea about when the least people would be home, or awake. The mom worked days, the drug dealing sons were typically asleep in the afternoons and the teens would go out to see friends after school. So, we took a wooden dining chair and quietly walked up to the retaining wall. We couldn't see anyone at the windows, so he hopped down and I lowered the chair to him. He placed the chair and using his shirt to protect his hand from the hot bulb turned the bulb just enough to turn it off! He then hopped down and raised the chair. I grabbed it and then C hopped to the top of the wall. I don't recall him needing a hand up. The whole clandestine raid took less than 30 seconds! The light stayed unlit for several blissful nights!\n\nWhen they either tightened the bulb, or replaced it, we had no idea which. We would wait one - four days and then we would repeat the process! After the light bulb, or multiple light bulbs, kept failing they finally gave up on the porch light! It took about three months! But, we were sure happy to have an unlit bedroom window!",

        "text": "Saw a post in another sub about pickles and it brought up this memory.\n\nPre-pandemic, my family went to Burger King once and he ordered his food with no pickles. The chick at the register had us repeat each order like three times because she was texting while taking the orders. The guys working in the back were throwing food at each other as they made drive thru orders. When we got our food, two of four orders were wrong, including dad's food having pickles. We politely took the food back up and asked just for the corrected items. They took 15 minutes to give us back THE SAME BURGERS, and we know they were the same because of obvious identifying areas on them. Dad's still had the pickles, just now they were under the meat patty. He asked them again for a new burger, and they handed him one about 5 minutes later. New burger, but...extra pickles.\n\nHe stuck the pickles on their window next to our table. My brother jokingly called him a Karen as we walked out. Dad made a comment about making a complaint with management, but we figured he'd forget about it and move on. A couple days later, I had stopped by there with my partner in the morning for a quick breakfast, and they had a sign saying that they had no staff and would be closed until further notice. I ended up seeing the girl from the cash register later that week in a retail store, (super small community, we run into the same people a lot) talking on the phone about how she needed the other person on the phone to cashapp her some money to buy something because her last paycheck was taken by the company because of the money she was stealing from the registers and talking about how the company is pursuing legal action on the entire staff from that restaurant.\n\nNot a very long or exciting story, but it felt like my dad may have single-handedly shut that place down....over pickles.",

        "text": "I have dwarfism, and this often leads to weird interactions in public, especially with kids. Sometimes a kid comes up to me to ask me why I’m so short, and I have a pre-prepared response for that, but most of the time they just loudly ask their parents why I’m so short. Usually the parents will awkwardly drag their kids away, telling them not to comment on people in public, which is sad but understandable. I like the parents who just say something about how some people are born like this, and even though we look a bit different we’re still regular people just like everyone else. Sometimes I hear a gem like “I bet he shrank in the wash”.\n\nWhat I can’t stand is when people try to use me to parent their kids. I’m sure you can think of ways to convince your kids to finish their plate at dinner that don’t involve pointing at a dwarf in public and saying “that’s what happens when you leave food on your plate” or “he didn’t listen to his mommy when she told him to eat all his vegetables”. It’s rude, it’s humiliating, and it teaches your kid that differences are a bad thing and that people are at fault for their differences or disabilities. It just pisses me off.\n\nA few days ago I was in public and a kid who was maybe 4 or 5 years old was acting out, and his mom was clearly struggling to keep him under control. So she pointed to me and told her son that I was one of Santa’s elves, and I was watching him and would tell Santa about his behavior. The kid’s name was on a key ring on his backpack so I just said “it’s ok Hunter, you’re already on the nice list, and Santa told me you’re getting an iPad this Christmas.” Hunter was excited. His mom was not.",

It has been 7 years since I saw him last and I've gotten much better at rapping as well as recording and producing since then.

I had to get up in front of her (no easy task in traffic) and stop to get her to finally get out and exchange info.\n\nShe didn't speak very good english, but I managed to get her contact and insurance info. By this point I had cooled down a little, so I let her go on her way because we were blocking traffic and I still had to get to work. Later that day her son called me and asked if they could take care of it without bringing insurance into it. The guy seemed sincere, so I initially agreed despite the fact that she had tried to hit and run, and quite frankly the damage to my car was pretty minimal.\n\nOf course he ghosted me after that. I called his cell, his work, and his Mother's number repeatedly over the course of more than a week, and got bupkis in return.\n\nSo I called the cops. I filed a report, called my insurance, and called her insurance with the police report number. \n\nMy insurance wanted me to get inspected by their representative, and when I took it in, the guy told me outright that the damage was minor. He implied that it might not be worth my while to file a claim, what with the time it would take, and getting a rental and all that. I told him outright that 1. she had tried to hit and run, and 2. she and her son had ghosted me afterwards. Because of that I was determined to make her pay every cent - AND I wanted my car to look brand spanking new when it was all over.\n\nIf they had made good on their word I probably would have buffed out the paint myself and lived with a small dent on that side, but this way, instead of just cutting me a check for about six or seven hundred dollars, they and/or their insurance had to pay almost $1500 for OEM parts and paint for the repairs, AND she now has a hit and run on her record. \n\nMy rep later told me that there was a very good chance that her insurance company would drop her, and it would be hard for her to get new coverage. A hit and run is **much** more serious than just trading paint on the freeway.\n\nLesson learned: Let your insurance company put in the work of going after someone who owes you. That's what you pay them for.",

        "text": "Years ago, embarrassingly I was a booty call to a Fire Marshall named Chad (not his real name). I occasionally worked with him in my days as a temp in a small town. Chad wasn't \"emotionally available\" which is code for he was looking for someone better. I was such a doormat at the time that I would bring him lunch (which I paid for) on a regular at the fire station where he worked. I even used to read the fire regulation manuals he would leave around his apartment so we had something to talk about, yeah I was a big doormat (who used to know a surprisingly large amount about fire safety regulations). \n\n\nOne day I brought Chad a sandwich as usual. He was reading a physics textbook and he turned to me and said: \"did you know that a feather and a bowling ball fall at the same rate?\" Btw they don't they fall at the same rate unless they are in a vacuum like outer space, but hey he was at least decent at his actual job so I wasn't going to nitpick. It turned out that his sudden attempt to branch out and be a better man was because he had an intern that was assigned to him for the next few weeks. He had immediately decided that she was the best person ever. It probably helped that she was 20 years old, pretty, and from a well-off family. Chad talked my ear off about her that day, it was obvious he had an infatuation. \n\n\nA couple of things should be cleared up before the misunderstanding that I am mean to firefighters or public servants comes up. The intern was not a firefighter or an EMT or a cop or any of that. She sat in on local governmental organizations for a general management class. Her internship was to watch how a fire station is run for two weeks then write a report on it, just like the other people in her class were to sit in on places like the courthouse, the hospital, and the police station. Also, I would never subvert or do anything to take away from the public or personal safety of anyone or anything for any reason. I can easily live my life with egg on my face for the greater good and do often in truth. \n\n\nDue to the fact that at the time I worked closely with those particular firefighters, I knew I would have to deal with the intern from time to time during her study there. It became clear to me that all too often there is a societal trend for women to be petty with one another. In response to this thought, I decided to be as friendly as I could be toward this person, after all, it wasn't her fault my fat non-committer was crushing on her. I saw her that first week when I was between shifts dropping off some training equipment at the fire station. I smiled and said a polite greeting to her, in return her response was to look me up and down and scowl at me without a word back. That night Chad and I went out to see a movie. It was frustrating that he kept going on about his beautiful intern. He wanted to know if she had said anything about him to me. He started asking me to help him date her during our date. I could not have been more disinterested. I was over it after a few minutes and went home. \n\n\nChad called me over to his little side office the next day and I thought he was going to apologize to me for being so rude the night before. I was wrong. He gave me a fool's errand to volunteer with his intern for a public training day, and I was a contracted employee at the time could help run it. Out of morbid curiously I wanted to know if she was into him or if he was sexually harassing her at work, so I went along with it. The whole day she was beyond impolite to me to the point of being outright hostile. She was either an unbearable jerk, actually seeing Chad as he hinted, or something else I would never figure out. No matter how nice I was to her, I was met with an over the top obnoxious attitude. She did the routine of a spoiled teen. There were eye rolls, lots of huffing, mumbled insults, and instead of speaking to me she would turn her back and wait to talk to someone else. I finished out my day exhausted from babysitting an immature girl. \n\n\nBy the end of her internship, I was done with Chad. Not that it mattered because the intern and Chad were inseparable by then. I felt a little less like an outcast when I learned that the intern was hateful to every woman who crossed her path. Apparently, she flirted with the guys and put down the women openly. Unluckily for me, there was a small ceremony for all of the community interns, and as a part of my job, I was required to go. This meant that everyone at work had to start their scheduled shifts an hour early that day. It also meant that I had to deal with Chad and his bratty intern again. When I arrived I decided to be as mentally checked out as possible, I was ready to leave as soon as I could. Right after I got there the interns started lining up outside to get their award certificates and the dull speeches were about to start.\n\n\nI thought standing in the back would put me closer to where I had parked. Just when I felt like the whole event was going to go off without issue and that I was worried about it being awkward for nothing, Chad walked up to me and struck up a conversation. It was then that I learned that Chad had gotten his intern an actual firefighter trainee dress uniform (at his personal expense and despite her not being or planning to be a trainee at all). He was anxious because she was taking so long to get ready. He asked me to check on her. I went into the woman's locker room and found her there. She was standing at the ironing board in her underwear. The girl had burned multiple holes in the uniform and was crying because she couldn't figure out that irons have different settings for different materials. I guessed she had never had to iron her own clothes before and put two and two together to realize that Chad had probably instructed her to press the uniform when he gave it to her and that she was too proud to admit she didn't know how to do it. When I went to help her out, she literally snarled at me. \n\n\nIt was right then that I decided being nice to her was never going to improve her attitude toward me or any woman in general. At that moment I was done with that kid. I smiled and walked outside and told Chad that she was just finishing up without helping her at all. Then, I went over to my co-worker (who was known as the biggest loudmouth) and told her that the rude intern was in the bathroom burning holes in her uniform while she cried in her G- string. This co-worker was not a friendly or even tactful person. She laughed saying no one is that dumb, not even that twat of an intern. At that moment Chad had overheard us and he quickly ran over to the women's locker room. I could see the panic on his face that made me have to repress a giggle. It felt good to finally stand up for myself with Chad and his little minion.\n\n\nThe annoying intern walked around with huge burn marks on her clothes all day. She looked ridiculous. Before the event was over I could see her turn beet red when the Mayor sternly asked what had happened to her uniform. After it was all said and done, I realized that I should have never dated a person that I worked with. That's the real lesson here for me. Hopefully, the intern learned that she shouldn't have burned bridges with every female in her vicinity. I think that she was trying to cozy up to the guys around her and forgot that a person needs to be able to communicate with those around them and not just date their way into a career. Instead, she picked the path of hitting on the guys and insulting the woman she worked with. Had she have been a little nicer, one of the girls from the station would have let her borrow something, but you can't help a growling monster, and so no one helped her that day to be sure.",

        "text": "This happened just before summer ended. TLDR at bottom\n\nAt the grocery store where I work, there is a large 'cart corral' at the front of the store directly in front of you when you walk in the doors. This corral holds 90+ shopping carts when full, in 4 columns of interlocked metal. So you can imagine how much empty space there is when it's not full.\n\nOne of my duties is to keep an eye on that corral and, when it starts to get empty, go out and refill it with carts in the parking lot. This is a time consuming process. And while it is happening, any number of people will attempt to use the space in the corral for their own purposes. 'It's empty space, no one's using it brah!' Yes, actually, I am using it. It is not for your use.\n\nSo one day, I'm out grabbing carts and when I come back, a dude is literally parking his bicycle inside the corral, kickstand, helmet and everything. I attempt to advise him that this space is not a bicycle parking area and he snaps back with \"I'll just be a minute! Don't you touch my fucking bike!\" Now, unbeknownst to him, I've had this problem before. That time, I moved the bike outside and continued my work. Management told me to never do this again since, if I touch the bike and it is later stolen, I can be considered liable for the theft or even an accessory after the fact. So there is no way I am touching this bike. That said, it's right in the way and I still need to get carts inside.\n\nIt is at this point that I come up with a plan. This man has told me not to touch his bike. Ergo, he probably doesn't want *anyone else* to touch his bike either. Well, I can help with that. I proceed to gather 12 shopping carts and, with a little finesse, form a wall of steel around this man's parked bike without ever directly touching said bike. I use the chain locks to make them one interconnected unit. Then, for the finale, I take the CartKey (tm) to lock them.\n\nA quick note about the CartKey: For anyone who's never worked with shopping carts before, some stores utilize magnetized wheel locks that stop the cart from leaving the store's property. I'm not exactly sure how the mechanism works without a power source in the cart, but it's damned effective all the same. Attempt to leave the property and one of the wheels locks. Making the cart itself entirely impossible to move if you don't lift the locked wheel off the ground. One of my duties is to head out to the edge of the property with a CartKey to unlock them. This nifty device, when placed close to the locked wheel and a button pressed, will unlock said wheel allowing you to roll the cart back to where it belongs with ease. What a lot of people don't know, is that these CartKeys also have a button to *lock* the wheel instead. It is rarely ever used, but it *does* exist.\n\nSo, I go to fetch the CartKey, make sure to arrange the carts so that there's no entrance or exit for the bike without moving them, and proceed to lock each and every wheel on each and every one of the 12 carts. Satisfied that *absolutely no one* is going to touch this bike, I go back to filling up the cart corral and watching out for the dude who parked the bike.\n\nAs soon as I catch sight of him in line at the register, I head inside and tell my boss that I'm taking my lunch. 30 minutes of sweet freedom. So I head out to my car and drive to an A&amp;W down the street. Silly me, I forgot to put the CartKey back in the store before I left.\n\nWhen I get back from lunch, I am greeted with a glorious sight. Bike Dude is standing in the entrance way with milk, popsicles and cans of frozen fruit juice just gleefully melting and going bad in the sweet summer heat. Dude is yelling and screaming at the manager. \"You think this is funny?!\" \"I'm going to sue for theft!\" \"I want a refund on my groceries!\" Blah blah blah. Then he catches sight of me heading into the store and rushes to get into my face. \n\nBD: \"You! You did this to me, you fucking asshole!\"\n\nMe: \"Hrm? Did what?\"\n\nBD (pointing to his well protected bike): \"You fucking locked my bike away! You fucking fuck! My groceries are going bad because of you!\"\n\nMe (with a smirk): \"Oh? So you're inconvenienced because someone else parked where they shouldn't have? What a co-inky-dink!\"\n\nAt this point, my manager comes up with a half-hearted Disapproving Stare: \"semitnuP, do you have the CartKey? We can't find it and this...gentleman... needs to get his bike.\"\n\nI put a show on of smacking my forehead and pull out the CartKey: \"I'm so sorry, boss! It totally slipped my mind that I had that in my pocket! Here you go!\"\n\nBike Dude tried to have me fired for that stunt, but it was rightfully pointed out to him that he'd parked his bicycle where it was not supposed to go and that, while my particular parking job was not company policy per se, that was where carts were supposed to go and he should have expected his bike to be buried by the carts. I did get a Stern Lecture about intentionally locking the carts to make his day worse, but my manager was trying his hardest not to laugh while he did so. So I think I'm in the clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: An entitled prick tries to use my cart corral as his own personal bicycle parking. Instead, he gets a taste of his own medicine when he comes back to find his bike buried in locked carts.",

        "text": "This happened just yesterday. My husband and I took a little weekend staycation and decided to hit the main drag through the college part of town. We don’t eat at restaurants much - service seems to be getting worse, everything costs more, and tbh my husband can make better “copy cat”food 90% of the time, but bar-hopping is a bit different. \nAnyway, there’s this bar we always stop at for a margarita (they have a bajillion options) while we’re in that part of town, and we bellied-up. The bar was pretty empty and there were 2 tenders behind it, neither of whom acknowledged us. Not even a quick “hey guys, our bartender will be right with you…” When we finally asked to order, the girl standing there (who apparently wasn’t the bartender…) told us the other bartender would “get to us.” Well okay then.\nWe got our drinks, and then decided to go outside on the patio and enjoy the nice weather and the people watching. Once we sat down, I asked the not-bartender bartender (who now happened to be nearest to our table) for some water. She brought out two disposable plastic cups that the bar would typically use for shots or cocktails. Whatever, maybe this is how they served water. \nSoon a group of 4 sat at the table next to us. The not-bartender brought them huge glasses of water - you know, the giant plastic red ones that completely differentiate water/soda from alcoholic beverages.  Ummm, okay? Why didn’t we get large glasses? All we could think of was that we asked to be served. Or maybe she didn’t think we’d order anything else so it wasn’t worth the effort? Either way…\nSo here’s where the petty revenge comes in. I had brought my water bottle along with every intention of pouring whatever water I didn’t drink into it before we left. Obviously, these little glasses wouldn’t fill my water bottle, so I called her over (because she would literally walk by our table without making eye contact) and asked for more.  Out came 2 little cups, without so much as a word from the not-bartender. I did this 3 more times, with a few minutes in between. Needless to say, she was super pissed that she had to keep running back and forth, she didn’t hide it well, and she didn’t get a tip. And yet all of this could have been avoided if she had just brought me an actual glass of water in the first place.",

It looked nice, was a little different than the surrounding homes but it wasn't pink and yellow, or anything stupid.  Some whackadoodle across the street came over and said it was horrible looking and told me to change it.  Well, I wondered if maybe I wasnt thinking right, so I asked 4 other neighbors and none of them had an issue at all, thought it was a nice improvement.\n\nSo I let him know no one else had an issue and he told me \"I've got deep pockets, if you don't change it I'm getting a lawyer!\" I told him to go ahead and have a nice day.  After a few lawyers told him he had no case, he tried to get an HOA formed. Held meetings, paid someone to draw up the proposed rules, etc.. no one else would agree so his investment was a waste and he just wouldn't stop bitching about bit.\n\nWell I already owned several rental properties at that point and was always on the hunt for more, so when the houses next door to him were selling, I ended up buyjng both of them but never told him I owned either.  I had picked up the first one in early fall and the other in the winter, so when summer rolled around I had both of them painted the exact same as mine.  He was sooooo pissed.  🤣\n\nEven better is the fact that I bought them in 2009/2010 and sold them last year for a very nice profit.  Thanks irrationally angry man!",

Literally almost everyone that worked there, was on Heroin or some other type of drugs.\n\nMy son did inventory and some ordering and knew someone and /or multiple people were stealing from the business. \n\nHe reported it to his manager, who'd said they look into it. \n\nThe next night, he worked his normal nightshift and at the end the manager came in and asked to speak to him. \nShe accused him of stealing and said she had it on camera. \n\nHe asked what he stole and she refused to give him an answer and said that for \"legal reasons\" she couldn't tell him. He then asked to see the camera footage and was given the same answer. \n\nHe came home visibly upset  and scared. He thought they were going to call the police on him and he was also worried about having a \"termination for theft\" on his job history. He had just turned 18 and just graduated high-school. \n\nI told him that she had nothing. Otherwise she wouldn't have let him work all night by himself, that  they didn't have any camera footage or she would have called the police.  That more then likely she didn't want him snitching on her and her druggie friends.  \n\nAt these gas stations, they had a service that customers could use, in which the gas station made a huge part of their profits from. I have worked in a lot of factories and knew that the gas station did not have the appropriate safety signage nor training for this service. There was a lot of high voltage, and frankly, no one should have been operating this service without signage or training. \n\nI called OSHA and filed a report. \nNot one week later, this service was shut down. Not only was that place shut down, but the inspector went to every gas station this company owned in a 15 mile radius and shut every single one down and gave the company a huge fine for every infraction at every station. \n \nIt didn't end there- OSHA showed up at their gas stations for years. More fines, more shutdowns. \nA few years later, the company ended up selling the service to a third party contractor,  to get rid of the headache. \n\nThe manager never filed a police report , there was never any camera footage . In fact, she was fired after the first OSHA inspection and they later found out she had been stealing.",

        "text": "So, someone I know hit my car while it was parked where he works.\nAt first he was so apologetic and said he’d do anything to make it right. Then it came out that he’s uninsured. With that knowledge, I tried my best to avoid a police report because he could easily get in legal trouble. I was trying my best to be nice.\nSo the two options were either he pay the body shop in full (almost $3000) or he pays the deductible for my insurance, repairs are made, then he works with the insurance to pay them back, even if this means garnishment. At least this would avoid suspension of his license or right to register.\nAnyway, I text him just expressing the importance of figuring this out because we have 30 days to file and it was already a week and a half since. My insurance agent also asked me to relay that the paying the deductible then paying them is best to avoid repercussions. So I did. Mind I’ve been nice this entire time. Even though he totally trashed my car because he decided to whip out of a parking space way too fast and the wrong way without looking. I didn’t even tell anyone else but my agent, mother, grandma, partner and boss since I had to go to my vehicle while working. \nHe proceeds to text me “I’ve been driving longer than you’ve been born, I think I know this stuff.” (He’s maybe 40, I’m 26. It’s not like he’s been driving for 50+ years lol. Plus no matter how long you’ve driven doesn’t make you knowledgeable or good at driving… haha)\nI respond that there is really no need for sarcasm and I was just relaying something I was specifically asked to by my agent. He continues with that I’m lecturing him. I told him it wasn’t a lecture, just a message being relayed. If anything, it was my agent lecturing him for driving uninsured for 6+ months.\nHe continued on and on, even saying “I can do this all day” and “Every text you send I can respond” even when I had stopped and asked him to not ever contact me again.\nSince he wanted to play this game I decided to not only tell my insurance to go after him for whatever they can, I included everything where he admitted fault (so they can use in court when they go after him) and even filed a police report so we can obtain the video evidence of him hitting my car.\n\nSo yeah. Now he’s at risk for losing his license and right to register. Do I care? Nah. Don’t drive without insurance. Also don’t be rude to the person you hit who is trying to help you out even though you’re completely at fault.\n\nNot the most petty I’ve been but it was fun.",

        "text": "There’s a local self-service that accepts coins and dollars for payment.  This car wash offers items needed for a car wash…a foaming brush, pre-soaking spray, power washer wand, waxing spray, heavy duty vacuums etc.  After a going to the the beach, I needed to vacuum my car.  I went to the car wash, inserted the required amount of money and nothing happened.  Coincidentally, I noticed that another customer lost his money.  He just moved his car to a stall and paid again. Fortunately for him, that one was functioning properly.\n\nSince this was a self-service facility, there wasn’t an attendant on hand.  I looked for a number to contact the owner. I  found a small sign with a telephone number.  Unfortunately, the person who answered had no idea about the car wash and told me I had the wrong number.  \n\nThis made me angry.  As the guy finished washing his car, I searched my car for sheets of paper and pen.  I proceeded to write “OUT OF ORDER” on each sheet of paper.  When the guy left, and the coast was clear, I placed these notes in the slots where customers inserted their cash.   This particular place was fairly small. It had 5-6 stalls and 3 vacuums.  I was determined to put sheets in every single payment slot. I only wish that I had tape to completely cover the slots.  While I was inserting the “OUT OF ORDER” slips into each slot, one car pulled up. I told them that the machines were not working properly and I lost money.  I told them what I was doing and wanted to make sure that others didn’t lose their money. They thanked me and they pulled off.\n\nI’m not sure how many people attempted to wash or vacuum their car that day, but this company lost several customers (hopefully for 1-2 days).  \n\nI’ve never been back.   I can’t imagine how many people lost money and just brushed it off like the other guy. Perhaps I should swing by to see if they fixed the contact information. If I do, I just might have some tape on hand.",

My manager was a 27 year old kid with one braincell who was jealous on us devs for making more money than he did(he was a guy who took a marketing course and bamboozled our less than bright too rich for his own good CEO).  \nI started making them an ERP so the company could be better ran than just on pieces of paper, and had to fight this guy at every step. He insisted I didn't give new hires technical tests because it was \"intimidating\", so we hired 2 incompetents- a woman who would copy code from SO and a guy who coded really well for 1998.  \nOf course the product was late.  \nSomehow, this was my fault.  \nI explained that I could not do everything and manage the website alone, but no, this was  somehow my fault.  \nlong story short, they fired me when I was 2 weeks away from releasing the brand new custom ERP. I started laughing at them when they told me. These guys had begged me to stay, promised me the eartjh and moon to not leave. Costed me an important opportunity.  \n\n\nThey locked me out of my computer and I left laughing. I had all the code on my home machine because I worked from home a lot. They never asked for it.  \n\n\nI kept the code, finished it and now I'm selling it as my own product. Made me some decent money.  \n\n\nIdiots. Their company is still ran on pieces of paper.",

While I am writing on the paper l, I explain what I  am doing. E starts laughing. About the time I am finished, the fiance comes over from having clocked out.

        "text": "I was at work in the break room talking about dirt biking, my son and I both raced motocross. We weren’t awesome but we had fun. Probably 4 or 5 people were listening and TheDude comes up and says, “You’re doing it wrong, I know way more, I could show you.” Oh, you wanna front me off in front of people? \n\n“Ok, TheDude, I’m free Sunday, so come on over and show me”.\n\nTheDude: “Ummm, ok? I don’t think this turned out like he planned. Maybe he had no plan, just a mouth that ran too much sometimes.\n\nSo he shows up on Sunday and my son and I are in the field behind my house fully geared up (helmet boots, gloves, googles etc) , with my race bike, a 250 2 stroke. It’s a beast. If you crank the throttle too much, it will loop out (flip totally over backwards) at 40 mph, it will hurt and it will cost money to fix. TheDude shows up in tennis shows and jeans and a Tshirt. I fire up the bike. It scares him shitless, he had maybe ridden once in his life on a mini bike years ago, I’d ridden for 20 years. Now he’s facing paralysis. But I’m holding his feet to the fire, my 12 YO son knows the deal and he’s right with me. So I fire up the bike, it’s loud and sounds like a million pissed off bees. I ride it around, doing wheelies and hitting top gear, over 50 mph across the field, hitting small jumps and getting some small air. I fly up, slide to a stop and shut it off. \n\nMe: “Here, you go, show me how it’s done”. I hand the bike to him. \n\nIt's very quiet now.  TheDude is pissing down both legs. He let his mouth talk him into a spot he doesn’t have the talent for and it just might put him in ER, probably not how he planned on spending his Sunday. He gets on the bike and you can practically hear his knees knocking against the bike. He tries to kick start it, he can’t. I take the bike and fire it up on the first kick. He gets back on and kills it as he’s too scared to give it enough gas, can’t even operate the clutch. He can’t start it. I take it back, fire it up, give it back. He kills it again. I know he sucks, my son knows he sucks and he knows he sucks. I start it again, tell him it’s easy, do some wheelies, give it back. He kills it again. I fire it up and tell him to just give it more gas. He revs it up, the bike screams, he lets out the clutch too quickly and the bike loops out immediately. From where the rear tire spun to where the exhaust pipe dug the ground was a total of 4 feet. The bike dies, he’s flat on his back and wondering if he’s broken something. It gets totally quiet. \n\nAfter a pregnant pause, I ask him, “Are you done showing me how it’s done?” \n\nThe Dude in a very quavery voice: “Yep”.\n\nI pick the bike up, he broke the rear fender off when he looped it out. “You know you gotta pay for that, right?” Him: “Yep”\n\nI go to work the next day and tell everybody. ALL OF IT. The quaking, the killing the bike multiple times, the crash within 4 feet, the pissing his pants in fear the whole time. They called him Crash after that.\n\nTL;DR Dude says he can ride a dirt bike better than me in front of people. It turns out he can’t ride at all.",

        "text": "Many years ago I worked for an organization providing front-line customer service. It was a decent place to work but our manager had lots of rules. One of the rules was that we could not do any personal printing with the printers at work. If we did, we were expected to pay $0.50 per page for black and white printing and $1.00 per page for color. I'm not sure who made this rule but the manager was constantly reminding us.\n\nOur desks were not assigned. Meaning, any day you could be sitting at any desk, depending on your assigned tasks for the day.\n\nOne day, I was interviewing for another job within the organization (but at another location. Prior to the interview, the manager of the other location asked me if I'd mind printing a copy of my resume and bringing it with me as their printers were down for the day. I said no problem and figured I'd print it at work since it was work related.\n\nI was sitting at a desk that did not have a printer at it. The closest printer was located between my managers desk and an employee desk. So I printed it and stood up to go get it.\n\nBefore I go to the printer, my manager got there first. My print job went ahead of hers. When she saw what I had printed she said, \"OP, this looks like a personal print job.\" I explained it wasn't but she disagreed and said since it had nothing to do with our day-to-day work, I had to pay. $2.00 for four black and white pages. I begrudgingly paid up. I asked her what happened to the money and she said she always put it in the Christmas party fund. Alright.\n\nA few weeks later, I was sitting at the desk with the printer at it. It was lunchtime and everyone except my manager agreed to go to a nearby restaurant for lunch. I had walked out our building and realized I forgot my wallet. So I quickly ran back in to get it. When I got to my desk, I could hear the printer going. I was curious what was being printed as it was spitting out page after page. I quickly glanced at the pile and said at least 100 pages printed in color, announcing a sweet 16 for Trista, our manager's daughter. It very obviously belonged to my manager. My manager came out of the bathroom a moment later and seemed shocked to see me standing there. I picked up the pile and passed it to her and told her our Christmas party fund was going to be getting a big boost. She said nothing but looked really uncomfortable.\n\nA few weeks later, our district manager made his quarterly visit. He talked about the upcoming Christmas party and how excited he was for it. I decided it was time for some petty revenge. I raised my hand and said, \"just wondering how much we've accumulated this year for the Christmas party from print jobs?\" He looked so confused and asked me to explain what I meant. So I told him our manager's rule. He got really quiet and said he'd have to review this.\n\nThe next day my manager sent an email saying the printing rule was something she was misinformed on and would be abolished immediately. Me, being the little shit disturber I am, hit reply all and asked what would happen to the already accumulated funds? Someone else said we should have a nice healthy fund for a pizza lunch and everyone agreed.\n\nThe next day I hear my manager ordering 10 pizzas for lunch. Also used her own personal credit card to pay for it all. Do I think she was pocketing the printing money all along? Absolutely. But it was fun making her sweat and then having to spend nearly $300 the next day to make up for it!",

He started paying me via cash app, but he always shorted me in both checks and cash app. My s/o started getting involved and would be the one texting him and forcing him to send me my pay. He sent me about 80% of my earnings so I/we just assumed he was taking out taxes. I asked for my check stubs multiple times and he never sent them. I found an old stub and it turns out he didn't deduct taxes, I was a 1099 employee he was just not paying me right. I quit and got another job within 2 days making more at a place that is a national chain so I know I won't be ripped off.\n\n Que petty revenge. I called the labor board and reported him for not paying my wages. They are investigating now. (I have everything I and my s/o ever sent him and everything he sent us cash app, texts, stubs etc), I reported him for not paying his taxes, and I reported him for allowing underage kids to buy liquor. I have 0 remorse! I can't believe I worked for him for 4 years. But as I am sure everyone can relate to this, I needed the money bad. \n\nTL:DR My shitbox of a boss ripped me off on my pay so I ruined his businesses by reporting him to the labor board, the IRS, and the dept of rev for serving minors.",

I didn't sleep much for the first 5 days and couldn't eat or drink as I was throwing up every type of green liquid you can imagine. Between that, the severe pain and being ferried around the hospital for tests and scans, I've been exhausted. I'm in a room for 2 people and all my other fellow patients have been nice enough until this one. We'll call them A.\n\nMoans about everything. From the bed, to the nurses, to their partner not bringing in their exact needs, to the food, and not being put in a bed by the door because it was boiling by the window especially since it doesnt open..\n\nLast night my sleeping pill went missing. I was really ready for sleep though but A was watching TV. UNTIL 1AM!! With all the lights blaring. Turns out when nurse checked A was actually snoring but TV was too loud to hear it. TV went off and I finally fell asleep at 1.30.\n\n4am A gets woken for obs. Blood pressure, temperature, pulse rate, that kind of thing. AND PUTS THE DAMN TV BACK ON. I woke up with some choice words. Nurse says as they paid for TV there is nothing they can really do but would ask. (A had heard I'd been kept up till 1.30am and woken at 4) when the nurse asked the response was \"not turning off, because I'm watching\".\n\nWell I've been in this hospital many times over the last few years and I know how to cool the room. It's especially effective for the bed position A has. I was going to explain it this morning (even though I'm not, and never was boiling, just figured I could grab an extra blanket if I got cold).\n\nInstead I've been laughing to myself hear A moan about not having a bed by the door because it's like a sauna by the window. And this afternoon I had a snooze so heard no moaning at all. Bliss.\n\nI'll be here long after A leaves. As they get wheeled out, passing my bed by the door, I fully intend to mention I was going to explain it to them the night they screwed with my sleep. But I was so tired.... I forgot.",

I've asked the neighbour nicely to keep his dogs at home. He just says that it's my problem because I free-range my chickens on my own property. This man even went to another neighbour and gave her shit for feeding her own cat on her deck outside her back door because his dogs keep going over and eating the cat food and are getting fat. I've called the police to find out what I can do about it, but since there is no dog bylaws, there isn't much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA friend of mine moved her family down to the city to go to grad school and asked me if I would take her two maremmas. I said yes. For those who don't know, maremmas are big. They are livestock guardian dogs. They will protect my chickens from my neighbour's dogs. He messaged me tonight with a link with instructions on how to stop your dogs from barking. I lost it laughing. My dogs are constantly barking at his dogs at the perimeter of my property (which does not border his at all - his dogs are trying to come down my driveway and are running up and down the road all the time). I texted him back that my dogs are simply barking at his dogs when they try to come on to my property and if he wants my dogs to stop barking he needs to keep his dogs at home. No response from him but within 5 minutes all the barking stopped because he called his dogs home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow every time I hear my dogs bark, instead of getting annoyed, I smile knowing that my neighbour whose dogs have been killing my animals is annoyed. And that if he wants the barking to stop he actually has to train his own dogs.",

        "text": "So at my school there are two choices for a PE class. There is regular pe and there is a weight training class which is exactly how it sounds, there is a gym with a ton of weights and workout machines where the weight training students work. I have weight training this year.\n\n\n\n\nSo it is no secret there that I'm one of the weaker students of the class. Most people there are strong and work out a lot outside of school. I'm more of a skinnier guy and can't lift much which leads to me getting made fun of sometimes. But over the last few months I've been getting stronger by working out more and pushing my limits.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the people who make fun of me the most is this guy named Xander. For example whenever I lift something that's around 70 pounds and struggle a bit he'll set the machine on 110 pounds and easily do it, or when I do 5 pull ups and am struggling near the end he'll just show off and easily do 20. Yeah he likes showing off how athletic he is. Also when I did squats with a weight on my shoulders for the first time he said \"wow we finally found something he CAN do\"\n\n\n\n\nSo yah he is pretty annoying. So another thing that is in my weight training class is an arm wrestling ring. Basically it's a table where people arm wrestle a lot. I've gone up against some people, won some, lost some. It's all pretty fun, except Xander likes getting cocky and making comments about how he's better whenever he wins. He was also the second guy I've ever went up against and yeah he did it to me too. He did the thing where he doesn't do anything letting his opponent do all the work before he easily beats them. Since he was way stronger then me at the time.\n\n\n\nBut now I've gotten stronger like I said and he challenged me to \"see how strong I really am\" and we got to the table. A big amount of people in the class were watching because Xander was hyping it up that he was gonna beat me. We eventually get to the table and it starts. \n\n\n\n\nI could tell he was doing the same thing he did last time by letting me do all the work at first and was planning on easily putting my hand down. I could tell when he tried putting my hand down because I saw and felt him start to push, but I wasn't moving much. I started to push harder and use all the strength in my arm then boom, his hand hit the pad and I won.\n\n\n\n\nHe was annoyed and after that he stopped messing with me. So yeah that happened.",

        "text": "My wife of course hates my side of family. AFTER ASKING many times she said the reason being my attention getting shared from her to my sibling and parents. We are a very fun loving, no care kind of a family. Just live, laugh and be happy. No drama and such. For some reason my wife doesn't like that.\n\nAnyway, the story is my sister was joining us for a week with her kids as schools were on a break. My sister is a teacher. She is not very confrontational. So people misuse her a lot. Like she would never say NO to anyone. I went to visit her 300 miles away from my town. My kids were missing her and her kids and it was a sudden plan for the weekend. It really surprised her and the kids. They were excited and extremely happy to see us. \n\nWhile there we learned they have a week off. So kids were like let's go and stay in my town. After lots of No and Yes it was decided she will join us going back. \n\nMy wife wasn't happy but she couldn't say no to our kids. My sister has extreme motion sickness. She will sit with multiple bags to vomit in. Everyone knows this. Usually she sits in front on passenger side, it helps a little. We were driving a minivan. \n\nMy wife decided she will sit in front as this is our family car. Just to be a B***. I requested and she was like Nope. My sister said sure and sat in the back with her vomit bags. She doesn't speak up ever, as usual.\n\nI was pissed but I didn't want to make a scene. While driving back we got rain. I looked up on weather app and saw we were to have this rain all the way home. My windshield vipers were used up. So it was decided I will stop at any auto store or Walmart to grab and new pair as it was impossible to see. Plus, my sister wanted to use bathroom to throw up and wash up. \n\nWhen I was inside I got the idea of my petty revenge. I only bought the viper blade for driver side and told my family they are out of passenger side sizes. My wife didn't care much. I guess she didn't understand fully. \n\nSo I replaced the blade and we were on the way. Rain hit us hard. Vipers were only clearing my side of screen. Lol.\n\nAll the way she was freaking out as she cannot see anything. She was getting nervous and was like slow down. Can't see anything...this is dangerous. Lol\n\nWe made home safe. I could see everything clearly. I felt good.",

        "text": "Been lurking on this sub for a while now and love the content here. Not sure this comes under “petty” but it’s a juicy revenge, nonetheless. On the phone so apologies for any formatting issues. Tldr at the end.\n\nMy boyfriend (now fiancé!) builds and sells computers as a side hobby. He personally drives around picking up computer parts and charges a little extra for labour and a small profit. He usually lists on Facebook marketplace and meets the buyer in person to exchange the computer for money.\n\nA couple of years ago, I joined him as he drove to the CBD to sell a high specs computer for $1100 to a guy he met on Facebook marketplace. As I waited in our car, he went outside and carried the computer to the guy’s car. A few minutes later, he came back and I happened to see his bank app open on his phone. Surprised, I asked him whether the guy had bank transferred him rather than paying cash, which is usually how people paid him. He said yes, and I took his phone and saw that my boyfriend had taken a screenshot of the guy’s phone as proof of transfer, and on the top, it had “Scheduled Payment.” I worked at a bank at the time and knew straight away my boyfriend had been scammed. It wasn’t a legit transfer and he could just cancel it afterwards. I told my boyfriend to call the guy as we gave him the benefit of the doubt that he’d made a mistake. The guy said he’d be back, but never showed up, blocked my boyfriend’s number and blocked him on Facebook too. \n\nHere is where our revenge began. The guy was stupid enough to not put his Facebook profile on private. We went through his profile and saw it was fairly active. I tried to see whether we had any mutual friends, and we didn’t, but I soon found only one of my friends who was actually a friend of one of his. I asked my friend whether she knew his friend, who was another girl, and she said yes, that they worked together, and so I asked my friend to reach out to the girl, to say that her friend (the thief) had stolen our computer and we were trying to reach him. We also sent messages and screenshots to about 20 people who had either liked or commented on his posts recently. \n\nThe next day, we found he had put his Facebook profile on private, but it was too late. We had already received few replies from his friends and even a member of his family saying they’d talk to him, and the guy finally called my boyfriend back. The guy had the AUDACITY to accuse my boyfriend of ripping him off as he’d taken the computer to a pawn shop and they would only take the computer for like $450 and for ruining his reputation with all his friends, family and ESPECIALLY the girl he had been pursuing romantically for a while now…\n\nYes, the girl who was my friend’s work colleague… was the girl he had been crushing on for ages and had been going on dates with. Like what are the chances?! I later heard from my friend that the girl will no longer talk to him as she is disgusted with his behaviour and him as a person in general.\n\nAnyways he called to meet up and we ended up getting our computer back, but not without further verbal harassment from him for “ruining his life.” He demanded we tell everyone we messaged it was a ‘misunderstanding,’ that it was ‘all a mistake,’ and we were like “Ok sure buddy!” just to get him off our back. However, as we drove off into the glorious sunset, we sent an update and thank you messages to those who replied, and then promptly deleted all the chats. \n\nTldr: Scummy thief steals computer from my boyfriend. We ruin his reputation by reaching out to his friends and family when he won’t return our calls and messages. One of them is a girl he likes and now she won’t talk to him anymore.",

        "text": "My brother (20) has always been entitled, spoiled and demanding. I love him but his whole life, he'd cause shit and hide behind mom, who would defend \"her baby\". (To the point that even when people caught his lies on camera, she'd just accuse them of 'baiting him' or 'editing footage'. He is more like her/her family and I am more like my dad/his family. So he did no wrong in her eyes growing up and I did no wrong in dads.)  \n\n\nHowever, in the last couple years, my mom woke up and realized her adult son has \"the emotional range of a teaspoon\" and acts more like a 13YO demanding an allowance than a grown man. (He refuses to get a job to the point that the VERY GOOD jobs he's had, were jobs my mom got for him because she asked her friends for favors. My brother gets fired within a few weeks for mouthing off/refusing to shower.) She's been trying to get him on a better path but he explodes into a rage, leaves home, blows all his savings, and then comes home again only after mom begs him back. (He was like this his whole life.)  \n\n\nThings have been building, exploding, and restarting for a long time around here. A never-ending cycle that I hate but currently, my savings are low so chance of moving out is on hold. Anyway...I avoid as much as possible by simply  being out of the house as often as possible; I am not working, I am outside and in the woods/visiting my fave shops in town. Today was one of those days. So, I went for a walk and came back just in time to catch the tail-end of today's fight; the short version is \"My brother refused to go 10 minutes up the street to get a couple things at the store because mom wouldn't give him $30 extra to buy himself/his friends energy drinks.\" (She always gives us money to get ourselves something as a thank-you for running errands for her but has a rule that if our friends want something/we want something extra, we spend **our own money** on that.)  \n\n\nI said I'd do it; I still had my coat and boots on and figured an extra 20 minutes should let things calm down a little. (Plus, I intended on buying a fancy ice-cream treat I'd been craving recently but couldn't convince myself to go to the store for; I always feel bad just getting myself something.) So, I get to the store, grab my mom's items and walked to the back to the freezer. I then over-heard the owner say that due to the new sugar-tax, he's been buying smaller shipments of soda because they sell slower, now. I chuckle to myself because my favorite drinks are either sparkling water or sodas made with natural sugar so therefore aren't included in the tax. (And even if they were? A 6-pack will last me a couple weeks.) Then, I saw something that made me smile like the Grinch and ignited my usually dormant, almost non-existent petty side;  \n\n\nThere, on the shelf in the cooler, was ONE bottle of my brother's FAVORITE Mountain Dew flavor.(Voltage; it's kinda like blue raspberry.) I'm not a huge soda drinker outside the ones mentioned above but, I like a 'Dew once in a while. (Major Melon or an iced tea blend; both of which are less popular/had two full shelves available.) I asked the owner if he was saving that bottle for himself/his grand-kids and he said he wasn't/reminded me that due to slower sales, if I didn't get it now, I may not get it again for weeks. And wouldn't you know it? I found myself craving **that specific flavor**.  \n\n\nI bought it, as well as the last two bottles of normal Mountain Dew. (Did I mention how thirsty I suddenly was or how my brother **HATES** the iced tea and melon flavors?) I decided to just use my own card rather than my mom's money because my being petty shouldn't cost my mom's money. (And if I am buying **THREE** 1L sodas, I **should** spend my own money.) I then headed home. (But, you know I am not done, yet!)  \n\n\nUpon returning home, I chose to squeeze through the fence next to my brother's shed rather than the path next to my bedroom window; that meant I'd have to walk **directly past my brother to get inside** and wouldn't you know it? My parents were in the garage on the opposite side of the property! So, I stayed out to chat with them. (Perhaps speaking a little louder than usual?) I made sure to show them the soda I bought and how \"These are the only ones of these flavors left right now.\" I handed my mom's money back and ever so slowly, I opened the Voltage; making sure the bottle fizzed and let out that tell-tale hiss that ice-cold soda does. I saw my brother slinking over from the shadows and pretending not to notice, I handed my parents the bottles of regular; it's very seldom they drink it but I know they enjoy it once in a while/dad would **LOVE** to have a bottle at work with him as a treat. My brother made it over and asked if I got him anything. I looked at him and simply said \"Nope. You didn't give me money, mom did.\"   \n\n\nHe demanded I give the Voltage to him; saying he'd buy me a bottle of MM or the iced tea one to replace it. I looked at my parents, at him, at the bottle, and back at my parents; locking eyes with my mom. No idea what came over me but, I tilted my head back and proceeded to **chug the entire 1L bottle** and then unleashed the loudest, longest, most tummy-rumblingest belch **in my life**. Normally, I wouldn't be caught dead drinking a soda that quick (rare treat) nor would I ever belch like that in front of my mom (she's really disgusted by that) but on this night, exceptions were made.  \n\n\nI then wiped my mouth, excused myself while apologizing to my parents, (who were both trying not to laugh to the point I think I heard my dads sinuses pop from the pressure), and then looked my brother dead in the eye and said \"Get bent.\" He lost his mind and started screaming at me for being a \"Selfish little bitch\" which, as I am sure you can imagine, my parents didn't appreciate. Rather than get into another fight, my mom simply handed me her bottle, saying she appreciated the offer but \"I bought it so it's mine\". And my father? He happens to be friends with not only the owner of the shop I'd just come from but also the owners/managers of the **rest of the shops in town; including the big, fancy one** ***owned by the mayor***. (Don't ask me how my dad has so many friends; it's a mix of growing up together and my dad's reputation of being a hard, reliable worker along with a man you can trust.) SO...  \n\n\nMy dad simply called the shops and asked that they refuse to sell my brother the soda or energy drinks for the next couple weeks because he spends easily $100 a week. And wouldn't you know it? My brother and his friends have been hanging around the shops/surrounding businesses and generally being in the way. (But not to the point where cops needed to be called/they gave him a little leeway because they respect my father so much.) **So they requested my brother not come around for a couple weeks as they're running holiday events soon and he has a reputation of making women/young girls uncomfortable.**  \n\n\nTLDR: My brother acts like a child rather than a grown man and refuses to do even basic tasks to help our parents out, I do the tasks instead and get the chance to basically ensure he won't get his fave sodas for a while. My brother throws another piss-fit about that and ends up getting banned from the shops selling not only the soda he likes but also his precious energy drinks he \"needs\" each day for a couple weeks because he's generally a creep.",

        "text": "Long story short, I drive a ramp van in which my wheelchair locks into where the driver seat would go, using electronic hand controls. \n\nWhen I park I don’t need a handicap parking space, I just need a space where I can let down my van. The other day I went somewhere and there was one handicap spot open and it had the  hash marks that is an extended area for people with ramp vans. The parking lot was pretty full so I was glad I was one of the spots were open. Before I got to the spot a truck pulls in. \n\nIt’s an older guy I know. I see him put a handicap tag on his rear view mirror, gets out and walks of. This guy owns his one insurance company so I don’t know if it was a temporary handicap license or he did something shady to get a permanent one, but fuck it. I parked on the curb right behind his truck.\n\nIt is enough space for me to get out and for a car to pass by, but it blocked him from being about to get out. I went in to do what I had to do and I did it in no rush. This is at a court house and I knew he was probably dropping off something and he expected it to be a quick trip there. About 20 mins later I come out and dude is throwing a fit.\n\nHe was bitching to some people and was calling the police. He didn’t see me until I was getting close, my van door was already opening &amp; my ramp coming down &amp; I was rolling in when he saw me.\n\nI heard him yell at me &amp; I just kept going like I didn’t hear him and took off. His face was all red, you can tell he was pissed. The police wasn’t there so he couldn’t have been waiting that long, but it was long enough to make him mad and that’s all I wanted. I drove off laughing. \n\nTechnically I was illegally parked, but the guy is kind of a shady dude who is know… I guess you can say get his way and I got pleasure knowing the rest of his day was ruined and not just for me, but anyone else who might have needed that spot. I guess it was kind of petty.. but even if I would have gotten a ticket for being parked there it would have been worth it.",

        "text": "  First post.  Please go easy on me. \n\n    I made my weekly trip to the grocery store today.  After closing my trunk I noticed a black suv with tinted windows blocking the cart return.  Full length of the car, six inches from the cart return.  No possible way of returning the cart.  Clearly the person is waiting for a parking spot as the store is unusually busy for a Friday afternoon.  I wait patiently for about 30 seconds when the window suddenly rolls down to reveal this angry Danny Devito looking man pointing his stubby finger to the cart return at the end of the parking row.  \n\n    Instead of starting a battle of wits with an unarmed person, I walk to return the cart at the far end of the lot.  Not a big inconvenience for me, maybe another 30 seconds of my time.  What bothers me about it is not only the sheer self importance of this guy, but also whoever’s job it is to return the carts to the store is now also inconvenienced just because this guy refuses to move.\n\n   Now for the pettiness.  I get back in my car and do nothing but stare at the guy in my rearview mirror FOR THREE GLORIOUS MINUTES.  He proceeds to violently wave his little arm to get me to back out of my spot so he can take it.  NOPE.  Ain’t budging pal.  He squeals his tires in a fit of rage to get to the now vacant spot at the end of the row, by the cart return.  It is only then that I carefully back out of my spot and smile at him as he flips me the bird.  Oh what a joyous day!",

I only had to administer the Metallica therapy a few times before the music stopped being an issue. \n\nTLDR: neighbor was a loud asshole but I outlouded them",
