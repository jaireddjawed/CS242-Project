        "text": "Growing up in India I was led to believe that Hindus virtually disappeared from Pakistan over the years since 1947 solely due to religious persecutions, threats and forced conversions. [The following statistic is being constantly thrown around these days.]( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/11/protectingpakistanshindus)  \n\n\n&gt; According to some sources, at the founding of Pakistan, Hindus comprised nearly 15% of the country's population and now number barely 2%. Many have left, many have been killed, and many have converted to other religions to protect themselves. All in all, a travesty for a state that was created with the intended purpose of protecting minorities.\n\n[Some more](http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/25/world/la-fg-pakistan-hindus-20110725) [articles talking](http://zeenews.india.com/blog/being-a-hinduin-pakistan_493.html) [about the exact statistic.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Pak-Hindus-refuse-to-return-cite-harassment/articleshow/37817221.cms) \n\nThis statistic is so extensively used by the mainstream that most believe it to be true without thinking about it. I know this, because I was one of them. \n\nComing to the actual statistic -  \n\n&gt; According to some sources, at the founding of Pakistan, Hindus comprised nearly 15% of the country's population and now number barely 2%.\n\n\nThis 15% stat is from the 1951 census of Pakistan and it is true that today's population of Hindus is less than 2%(total minorities add up to ~3.5%) , but the context in which most use this is pretty wrong. \n\nMost are missing a fact that in 1971 ~55% of Pakistan's population seceded from Pakistan to form Bangladesh.\n\nThere is major disconnect between the two statistics. \n\nHere is the breakdown of religious demographic of East and West Pakistan in 1951(from their census data):\n\n|1951| East Pakistan | West Pakistan \n---|---|----|----\n**Muslim(%)** | 77 | 96.6  \n**Other(%)** | 23 | 3.4  \n\nComparing it to most recent estimates from CIA world factbook. \n\n|| Bangladesh(2004) | Pakistan(2010 est) \n---|---|----|----\n**Muslim(%)** | 89.5 | 96.4 \n**Other(%)** | 10.5 | 3.6 \n\n\nLet us talk about West Pakistan, contrary to the common belief.. population of minorities decreased substantially immediately during and after the partition. All in all, 6.5 million(Muslims) entered and 5.4 million(Hindus and Sikhs) left West Pakistan^1 with majority of migration occurring well before 1951.   \n\nEast Pakistan, until 1971, is a little bit tricky partly due to the fact that migration happened in phases. It is awkward to admit, but most of my reference material has been checked out from my univ's library. I need some more time to write regarding demographic shifts in East Pakistan/Bangladesh.  \n\n**Disclaimer:** I am not claiming that persecution of minorities isn't taking place in Pakistan, I am just merely correcting the exaggerated claims.    \n\n^1 Bharadwaj, P., Khwaja, A., &amp; Mian, A.

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2q5h16/the_whites_owning_black_slaves_in_america_hoax/",
        "text": "Take a look at [this astonishing article](http://beforeitsnews.com/blogging-citizen-journalism/2013/04/the-black-slavery-in-america-hoax-2446934.html). Admittedly, picking on bad history from a [literal Neo-Nazi](http://twitter.com/1488Julie) in the \"blogging/citizen journalism\" section of a crazy conspiracy website is low-hanging fruit, but let's do it anyway.\n\nAfter an opening paragraph of typical \"why can't the blacks get over slavery\" bullshit, the article stumbles while rounding the first bend:\n\n&gt;So many blacks owned slaves by the time of the civil war that 3,000 of them (Negroes) in New Orleans alone, or 28% of their total population, owned one of their own kind as a slave by the time of the Civil War. Meanwhile, it is well documented that no more than 2-5% of white Americans ever owned slaves.\n\nI don't entirely trust those figures because Neo-Nazi, but let's grant them for now. ([This article here](http://americancivilwar.com/authors/black_slaveowners.htm), which itself is [not from the most trustworthy source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_Review) but at least cites mainstream-looking sources, broadly confirms them.) Even still, though, it's illogical to compare the percentage of whites in the *entire country* who owned slaves to the percentage of blacks *in New Orleans* who owned slaves. New Orleans was distinctive, almost unique, in being a [EDIT: city in a] slave state with an affluent free colored population. It is absolutely not representative of the nation as a whole. You fail percentages forever, miss \"Julie Mitchell #WR\".\n\nBut that's just the setup for this doozy:\n&gt;In fact, 70% of the slave owners in America were Jewish, and the vast majority of the remaining 30% of slave owners in this country were the Negroes themselves.\n\nI ...\n\num...\n\nuh...\n\nShit, where was I? Right. Let's focus on the 70% figure, which is the first historical claim I've ever seen that can be disproved by long division. According to the [friendly neo-Confederates at the *Barnes Review*](http://americancivilwar.com/authors/black_slaveowners.htm), there were \"fewer than 385,000 individuals who owned slaves.\" I'll go out on a limb here and say that the *Barnes Review* didn't have much of an incentive to round that number up. It's surprisingly hard to find good figures for numbers of Jews, but the [friendly Chosen People at *The Jewish Magazine*](http://www.jewishmag.com/82mag/usa5/usa5.htm) put the 1860 Jewish population at 150,000, mostly Ashkenazim from Germany. (I hope they can excuse my disregarding their \"No Jews Welcome - Welcome to all Jews\" banner.) Most of those immigrants wouldn't have gone to the slave states, but let's make the most Nazi-friendly assumptions we can and say that literally every Jewish immigrant got straight off the boat and headed to the local mom-and-pop slave shop. Then we have 150,000 Jewish slaveholders out of 385,000. Now, is 150,000 of 385,000 (a) greater than 70%, (b) equal to 70%, or (c) less than 70%? [Check your answer in the back of the book.](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=150%2C000%2F385%2C000)\n\n[**EDITED TO ADD:** In comments, /u/AccountMitosis [suggests](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2q5h16/the_whites_owning_black_slaves_in_america_hoax/cn33kmn) that Mitchell is taking \"70% of slaveholders were Jews\" and \"28% of free blacks were slaveholders\", adding 70% + 28% = almost 100%, and getting \"the vast majority of slaveholders were blacks or Jews.\" Yes, of course this makes no sense whatsoever.]\n\n[**EDITED TO ADD 2:** I found a [possible origin](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2q5h16/the_whites_owning_black_slaves_in_america_hoax/cn3zudh) of the 70% figure.]\n\n&gt;The institution of slavery on the North American continent was somewhat of a rarity between 1525 and 1866. During that 341 year period, 388,000, or approximately, at a yearly average, 1,138, Negro slaves arrived every year.\n\nThe 388,000 figure is right, at least [according to this article by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. hyperlinked at the end](http://www.theroot.com/articles/history/2012/10/how_many_slaves_came_to_america_fact_vs_fiction.html). Everything else is bonkers. First, the slave trade in the US began in 1619 with the arrival of a [captured Portuguese slave ship in Jamestown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamestown,_Virginia) and ended in 1808 when Congress abolished the importation of slaves, at the earliest date the Constitution allowed. I can sort of understand choosing 1866 as the ending date, because it's close-ish to the [December 1865 ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), but a 1525 start date is just bizarre and lowballs the annual figure - *not that our author would have any motive to do that, of course.* More fundamentally, most slaves in the US were not imported from Africa. At the 1808 abolition of the slave trade, the slave population was already self-sustaining and [increasing naturally at 2.2% per annum](http://tinyurl.com/n2ph7za). Suggesting that imported slaves were the extent of slavery in the United States is absurd, and drastically understates its extent - again, *not that our scrupulously honest author would have any motive to do that, of course.*\n\n&gt;We already know that the civil war was just another one of the wars engineered by Jewish bankers on the road to world dominance, and we are devastatingly familiar with the lies surrounding the last one, which go as far as a manufactured Jewish holohoax.\n\nNot even gonna touch this bit.\n\n&gt;[E]ven though the Europeans were trying to bring civilization to the continent, the Africans resisted, and today accuse the evil white man of something referred to as “colonialism,” when in fact what European “colonists” sought to do as much as anything else was CIVILIZE a continent of savages. I would submit to you that genuine “colonialism” in its most nefarious form is in full swing today, as Jewish owned companies have succeeded in coming to dominate Africa and are currently raping the continent of its natural resources. \n\nNot gonna touch this bit, either, except to say that the prospect of a Neo-Nazi alliance with left-wing anti-globalists against corporate exploitation of Africa is almost heartwarming. Instead, I'll just quote a stunning own goal from the very end:\n\n&gt;White people, wake up. [...] Even the history of all the great white civilizations of the past, **from Egypt to Rome and every one in between,** is being stripped from you[...]\n\nTIL whites have been uncultured savages since 476 AD. Thanks, Julie Mitchell, for this ... uh ... *provocative* article, and if you're looking for ways to make white people proud of their glorious Aryan heritage and incite them to throw off the yoke of their Jewish overlords, maybe you should give historiography a rest and look into quilting or slam poetry or something.",

My R5 in the comments:\n\n---------\n\nThis is quite literally the stereotype of holocaust denial in one post. \n\n* Doesn't actually strike to the heart of the discussion but finds random extraneous cases and nit picks away at them.\n\n* Finds myths from immediately post war that were revised and at times discounted as proof that the entire edifice is some conspiracy\n\n* Uses the intentionalism vs functionalism 'debate' as proof that there is legitimate contention about the holocaust. \n\n* Misinterprets functionalism as saying that no one was responsible for killing Jews and that 'no order' = clean hands.\n\n* Focuses on the fact there was no 'clear order' even though it's pretty fucking clear it was more of a case of Hitler turning a blind eye to it all and saying \"Yeah this is what I'm thinking but you all handle it\"\n\n* Says all the Nazi's who supported the facts were lying\n\n* Points to all the death counts being revised as proof that there is historical debate/inconsistency but then says that no one can challenge the numbers because the Jews are keeping everyone silent.\n\n* Links wikipedia\n\nThis is literally the quick guide on how to be a stereotypical holocaust denier. They don't actually talk about the issue that is the holocaust and the facts at the center of it they talk about that one witness who got something wrong and then say how can we trust any of them. It's intellectual dishonesty at its finest. \n\nFact of the matter is this: The Holocaust was a heavily decentralized process. It was not one giant centralized effort in one place but tens of thousands of events in thousands of places all happening across four years. So you can't say *\"I found one little thing that's wrong with this account therefore the entire edifice comes crashing down\"* because that's not how it works. It means that situation was misinterpreted. That has nothing to do with the fact that the Einzatsgruppe Groups A-E, **by their own reports**, executed over 600,000 Jews between July and April 1941-'42.\n\nNo Functionalism doesn't = no one is guilty. It means that Hitler tried to first force the Jews to leave with discriminatory policies. Then he tried to deport them. Then he concentrated them into ghettos and tried to 'outbreed' them and once he got about 4 million extra Jews from West Russia it resorted to killing as they were overloaded. They killed hundreds of thousands by pure execution and by the end about 3 million of the total 5.5-6 million dead were killed by direct execution via the Einzatsgruppe. The rest killed, in majority, at the death camps (which were all in Poland) with Auschwitz being the one place to use Zyklon B, for reference. \n\n&gt; Typhus was a serious problem, and was being spread (by lice) among the prisoners. They deloused their clothes using zyklon b, a gas that is very good at killing lice, but not particularly useful for killing people.\n\nThe \"evidence\" for this is that in delousing centers there is blue stains on the walls but in the gas chambers there were not. The reasoning for this is basic fucking biology but that doesn't get in the way of deniers. Zyklon B is delivered via pellet and then dissolves. The reason delousing centers turn blue is because lice require an enormous pumping of the gas **because they are cold blooded** and thus don't absorb the gas. They literally needed to drown the lice in the things to kill them. Humans however are warm blooded and were also packed like sardines into the showers all gasping for air and getting hotter and hotter. It all absorbed into their skin with a very little amount and thus didn't require such a large amount to cause staining.\n\nIt's the same reason that pouring a small amount of juice onto a sponge will just be absorbed into the sponge but dropping half a gallon onto a sponge will stain the table around the sponge.\n\nAlso,\n\n&gt; but not particularly useful for killing people.\n\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\n&gt; How difficult would it be to find one of these so-called gas chambers, and prove - beyond all doubt - that they were used to gas people to death? Seems like it would be easy. And yet, they don't. In fact, the scientist who ran these tests was prosecuted for publishing his analysis, and had his book burned just for telling the truth.\n\nExcept they were found...just saying they weren't doesnt make it true.\n\n&gt; When you realize that there was no order to mass murder anyone\n\nThis is true for most genocides, what's your point? Because Hitler didn't give an explicit order to do so but just created the conditions for it to happen and said this is roughly what I dream of (a Jew free world) and gave his people the freedom to handle it how they wanted it somehow means the holocaust didn't happen? Like I said it wasn't one centralized event it was tens of thousands of little events in thousands of places spanning years. \n\n&gt; If solid proof is ever presented to me that these mass murders occurred, I will change my mind.\n\nIt is out there. Maybe you should \"dig\" for that since it's right fucking in front of you. No you aren't anti-semetic or a hate mongerer or a nazi but you are a contrarian and that is probably even worse than those because you don't even have prejudice blinding your judgement just contrarianism. You find some holes in the 'official story' or find it's not so black and white like you were told in 7th grade so thus the alternative, by default, **must** be true rather than the fact you got a simplified version of a stupendously complex event.\n\nBut here's some of the proof you want:\n\nGoebbels Diaries, 1948, pp. 86, 147-148:\n\n&gt; *February 14, 1942: The Führer once again expressed his determination to clean up the Jews in Europe pitilessly. There must be no squeamish sentimentalism about it. The Jews have deserved the catastrophe that has now overtaken them. Their destruction will go hand in hand with the destruction of our enemies. We must hasten this process with cold ruthlessness.*\n\n&gt; *March 27, 1942: The procedure is a pretty barbaric one and not to be described here more definitely. Not much will remain of the Jews. On the whole it can be said that about 60 per cent of them will have to be liquidated whereas only 40 per cent can be used for forced labor.*\n\nThis is from his 7000 page journal. Did the supposed Jewish conspiracy forge seven thousand pages to insert just a few lines? How did they manage to know Goebbels' affairs intimately enough to avoid contradictions, e.g. putting him or his associates in the wrong city at the wrong date? As even the revisionist David Cole has admitted, revisionists have yet to provide a satisfactory explanation of this document.\n\nRegarding postwar testimony from Nazis, were they all tortured into confessing to heinous crimes which they supposedly did not commit? This might be believable if only a few Nazis were captured after the war, or maybe if some had courageously stood up in court and shouted to the world about the supposed attempt to silence them. But hundreds testified regarding the Holocaust, in trials dating from late 1945 until the 1960s. **Many of these Nazis testified as witnesses and were not accused of crimes. What was the basis for their supposed coercion?**\n\nThe main point is that not one of these supposed torture victims -- in fifty years, not one -- has come forth to support the claim that testimony was coerced. On the contrary, confirmation and reconfirmation of their testimony has continued across the years. What coercion could have convinced Judge Konrad Morgen to testify to the crimes he witnessed at the International Nuremberg Trial in 1946, where he was not accused of any crime? And to later testify at the Auschwitz trial at Frankfurt, Germany, in 1963-65? What coercion was applied to SS Doctor Johann Kremer to make him testify in his own defense in 1947, and then, after having been convicted in both Poland and Germany, emerge after his release to testify again as a witness at the Frankfurt trial? What coercion was applied to Böck, Gerhard Hess, Hölblinger, Storch, and Wiebeck, all former SS men, all witnesses at Frankfurt, none accused of any crime there?\n\n**If you want a great library to combat basically every single thing you've said, read here: http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/denial1.html** A lot of my second part was directly cited from this cite as it puts it so concisely.\n\n--------\n\nI really just want to emphasize what I went over in the beginning: **This is how Deniers operate. They nitpick away at fringe stories of 'survivors' and say that's evidence the entire thing was suspect.** It is intellectually dishonest and only serves to 'win the argument' rather than prove their point. They find legitimate debates in the academic community and use that as proof that *'even the academics don't know how many people died!'*\n",

        "text": "For a start I want to say RULE 2!!! I will not break it (though if I do, please tell me if I do so I can edit that part) so I hope you all follow it as well.\n\nAnyway, I was randomly searching for the Constitution of the United States and this news article popped up (I'm not sure if this news article is satire or not)\n\nhttp://cnsnews.com/news/article/michael-w-chapman/santorum-separation-church-and-state-was-soviet-constitution-not-us\n\nThis article says this\n\n&gt;“The word ‘separation of church and state’ is not in the U.S. Constitution, but it was in the constitution of the former Soviet Union. That’s where it very, very comfortably sat, not in ours,” said Sen. Santorum during a coalition telephone call sponsored by STAND and posted on Dec. 1.\n\nWell for a start, which constitution of the Soviet Union. I know there are at least 3 of them, in 1924, 1936 and 1977. Yet the article goes on to say this:\n\n&gt;In Article 13 of the general provisions of the constitution of the USSR, adopted in July 1918, it states, “In order to ensure genuine freedom of conscience for the working people, the church is separated from the State, and the school from the church: and freedom of religious and anti-religious propaganda is recognized for all citizens.”\n\nI can see no such constitution for the USSR from July 1918. For a start the USSR wasn't yet founded in 1918, only being founded in 1922. I guess they mean the Russian Constitution of 1918 and not the USSR. (Though this was reiterated in the 1936 and 1977 USSR Constitutions, those aren't from July 1918)\n\nDid the USSR follow this, of course not, but that's not what we're saying here\n\nNow let us look what the 1st Amendment of the US constitution says \n\n&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the\nfree exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom\nof speech, or of the press; or the right of the\npeople peaceably to assemble, and to petition the\nGovernment for a redress of grievances.\n\nI guess he's not wrong if he wants the direct words of \"Seperation of Church and State\" to be said, but it essentially the same anyway, it literally says there, in the 1st sentence no law shall be passed establishing a state religion, and that no religion shall be preferred over another. I'm not sure how else this can be intepreted, but if we need help, let us go to a letter written by Thomas Jefferson. Here is an extract from his letter to the Danbury Baptists Association when they said in 1801 about there concern about a lack of preferred religion in the constitution. \n \nhttp://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html\n\n&gt; Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &amp; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &amp; not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church and State\n\nThere is the quote he wanted.\n\nAgain, NO RULE 2 BREAKING\n\nEdit: \n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Manifesto.pdf\n\nI just found a copy of the Communist Manifesto, I can't find anything about homosexuality, though I just searched for terms that could find it. Maybe someone with more knowledge can actually find something, but I can't.\n\nAlso found no references to pornography and Voter Fraud (I'm not exactly sure why the Communist Manifesto would want to establish Voter Fraud), the rest I haven't checked for as it would be difficult for me to do quickly.\n\nAlso what does the elevation of pornography even mean? Even so, this is even more baffling when you consider that Pornography was illegal in the USSR (though that doesn't mean it's not in the Communist Manifesto, it just isn't in that anyway) and was regularly used as charges during Stalins Purges, such as in the trials of Yagoda and Yezhov.\n\nSo yeah, I'm pretty sure they have no idea what is in the Communist Manifesto\n",

        "text": "Those of you who have been subscribed to /r/badhistory for very long will know that I have an inordinate fondness for movies and tv where history and puzzles collide (e.g. the Davinci Code, National Treasure). It should therefore come as no surprise that I thoroughly enjoyed the TNT movie [*The Librarian: Quest for the Spear*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412915/) and it's two sequels Return to King Solomon's Mine and Curse of the Judas Chalice.\n\n[Quest for the Spear](http://youtu.be/_LsPz8vCULE) trailer. \n\nWhen I found out that TNT was making a series out of the idea I was pretty excited for it. They were even smart enough to bring back some of the characters from the movie so that there's a sense of continuity between the old librarians and the new ones. \n\nOf course I knew going into this that there was going to be bunches of badeverything, but that's not stopped me from enjoying the show so far. We're currently three episodes in (the first night was a double-header), and the secret world of the Library has mostly been experienced through mythology and legend, so nothing too bad.\n\nHowever, there was one point in the first episode which had me yelling at the tv. The Librarians are on a quest to hunt down King Arthur's Crown, because apparently it's the key to unlocking magic and releasing it to the world. They find a clue which directs them to Munich, Germany to a painting titled \"The Crown of King Arthur\". Why Munich? Who knows. \n\n[This](http://i.imgur.com/NgTrY54.jpg) is that painting. The painting certainly looks typical of medieval art, and the placard on it says \"The Crown of King Arthur\". The librarians tell us that the painting was done in 1046 and was one of the first pieces in the museum when it opened in 1546. \n\nThe show is shot in Portland, Oregon, and the room they're standing in looks an awful lot like the [European gallery](http://i.imgur.com/NVPDFt1.jpg) of the Portland Art Museum. If that's the case, then it's possible that the show used an existing painting in the collection for this scene--it would certainly save them time and money. However, if they did use a painting in the Portland Art Museum I have no idea what it is. I spent quite awhile trying to find this painting (it's not titled \"The Crown of King Arthur\"]. If the show used it's own art department to do this (or commissioned the painting), then they screwed up badly on the details. \n\nAs the librarians exam the painting, one of them says \"Look at the swords of the knights. Roman short swords.\"\n\nNoah Wyle's character (the head librarian) then responds with \"Arthur's wearing the equipment of a Roman legionnaire.\"\n\nNo, no and no! This was the part that had me yelling at my tv. Those knights aren't wearing anything at all that resembles what a Roman soldier would have worn at any time in the history of Rome. They're wearing standard mail and tunics of the High Middle Ages, and their swords are typical of the High Middle Ages (11th, 12th, and 13th centuries). So if the show's art department was trying to convey the look of a painting done in the High Middle Ages, they did a pretty damn good job. They certainly didn't do a good job of depicting a Roman gladius (which is what most people think of when they hear the phrase \"Roman short sword\".\n\n[Here's](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Uncrossed_gladius.jpg) a gladius. The blade length of a gladius varied, depending on the time period in question but 24 inches for the blade length is probably a good average. \n\nWhat the knights are waving around in that painting is a pretty typical sword of the High Middle Ages. Sword names are imprecise, even if we're using [Oakeshott typology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakeshott_typology) but in the High Middle Ages even the shortest of the standard swords was longer than a Roman gladius. \n\nThe armor the knights are wearing is pretty typical of the High Middle Ages as well. It's chain with a tunic over the top. Roman soldiers did wear chain, but they would have looked quite different than these knights. The art style reminds me of that found in the [Maciejowski Bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Bible) which was created in the 13th century. \n\nWe also find out that Noah Wyle is the fastest art authenticator in the world. He takes one look at the painting and declares it a fraud based on the color red which he states is a carmine red which was only developed in the 1500s. True enough for the purposes of the show. [Carmine red](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Carmine.JPG/330px-Carmine.JPG) was a dye made from crushed bugs that were found in the New World. It was actually one of the first exports from the New World and was a popular color for a long time. I'm just impressed that he was able to tell it was carmine red and not some other red dye. \n\nThe clue they find in the painting leads them to a [henge](http://i.imgur.com/Uf6UqaB.jpg), which Noah Wyle's character gleefully informs us is \"unheard of in this part of the world!\". First off, do they *really* have to make the henge look almost identical to Stonehenge? Henges come in many different shapes and sizes after all. In reality a henge is a Neolithic earthworks that feature a ring bank and a ditch inside the ring bank. Stonehenge has become the iconic version of the henge, but there were many different ways in which henges were constructed. Sometimes they were just standing stones as at the [Ring of Brodgar](http://i.imgur.com/9GAuQJH.jpg) in Scotland. Sometimes they might just be wooden poles as in a henge discovered in 2010 [near](http://www.csmonitor.com/From-the-news-wires/2010/0722/Stonehenge-twin-a-wood-henge-is-found-nearby) Stonehenge or as in the famous [Seahenge](http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/consumption/groups/public/documents/web_graphics/ncc084098.jpg).\n\nAnd while it's technically true, that there aren't any henges in Europe, their overlap with [enclosed causeways](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causewayed_enclosure) is significant enough to make separating early henges from the causeways difficult, and causeways *have* been found throughout Europe. For example the [Windmill Hill](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/properties/windmill-hill/gallery-for-windmill-hill/galleryswwindmillhill01.jpg) causeway has many similarities to henges, and other causeways do as well.

        "text": "Bad History review of [*America Unearthed: Captain Kidd's Pirate Code*](http://www.history.com/shows/america-unearthed/videos/captain-kidds-pirate-code)      \n      \nThis had to be one of the laziest things I've ever seen made by that channel. Their premise is John Jacob Astor, a man in the late 1700s-early 1800s in America who got rich of the fur trade, actually got rich off finding Captain William Kidd's treasure.  They find nothing to verify this story.  In fact, this story should have never been investigated in the first place.      \n      \nFirst, let's hit right at the core of this (but not even the biggest issue with this show):  Captain Kidd and buried treasure.  There's no evidence for him having left behind a big fortune to begin with.  People forget that Kidd had to split the takings from the Red Sea with his crew, also that tons of what was taken went away with the captured *Quedah* vessel when he sold it in the Caribbean (which now has been found archaeologically, which the show never addressed).  What valuables he did have in New York got quickly recovered after his imprisonment.  Most claims about Kidd having this huge treasure that he buried is conjecture and legend.     \n     \nNow, the big problem: The John Jacob Astor story was originally a joke - but some people took it seriously.  In other words, the History channel took the bait of a joke from 120 years ago.  The book *The Secret Treasure of Oak Island: The Amazing True Story of a Centuries-Old Treasure Hunt* explain this:      \n      \n&gt;(pg 44) ...the practical joke began in 1894 when a Chicago industrialist wrote a pamphlet describing a fanciful lawsuit being filed against descendants of the John Jacob Astor family of New York. The \"suit\" alleged that the Astor wealth originated from a Captain Kidd treasure that had been illegally removed from Deer Isle, Maine...The elaborate joke was taken seriously by some writers, and was often printed as fact in books and magazine articles during the early twentieth century.      \n      \nThe story got so out of control through the next 100 years, that it eventually got tied into the Oak Island natural sink hole (or, \"money pit\").  If one goes and digs deeper into the joke story, you can tell someone of the 1890s wrote this since they hadn't done their research.  There's that series of numbers that Captain Kidd supposedly gave to his wife that had the numbers 44106818. The joke story suggests that these are the latitude and longitude of Deer Island on the coast of Maine.  While 44°10' N and 68°18' W is pretty close to the coordinates of the island, it's close for a measurement taken in the 1890s - since many people had been using the Greenwich Prime Meridian by then (Greenwich lab was made the official prime meridian in 1884).  The joke story's coordinates appear to have been referencing coordinates long after Captain Kidd.  At least the documentary by the History channel dwells on the numbers for only half the show.      \n      \nAnyway, other issues with the show:      \n\nThe show claims within the first few minutes that after turning pirate \"Kidd plundered his way around the upper east coast, reportedly amassing millions of dollars before being punished for his crimes.\" First, vague as hell. Second, he never plundered the upper east coast.      \n      \nThe show claims that John Jacob Astor's account suddenly jumped from a few thousand dollars US to $20 million out of nowhere (the jump supposedly being Astor finding the treasure). They only casually mention this and never expand on this in the show. Even the wikipedia entry on Astor shows he amassed only $250,000 from 1794 to 1800 through the fur trade (they site the Encyclopedia Americana on wiki).       \n      \nThe show claims that 200,000 people witnessed the execution of Captain Kidd in London. I have yet to see or hear of any document from the period claiming that many saw this. That would have been roughly a fifth of the population of London.  Also, if you think about how much room 200,000 people take (imagine the seating area of 2 or 3 American Football stadiums, that would probably be about 200,000), that requires a lot of room.  Many did see, likely numbering in the thousands, but what is the premise of 200,000 from?     \n      \n-----     \n     \nI suspect I missed other factoids on the show that they got wrong, but those are the ones that stuck out to me.  At least the show at the end quietly admits there is no solid evidence to verify all this. In fact, a member of the Astor family denies knowing anything about this, and the charter captain at Deer Island that they meet says the treasure being there is a myth.  But, the History Channel kind of admits this in a \"we couldn't find evidence, but surely the treasure is still out there\" kind of way.      \n     \nOverall, the biggest thing I got out of this show was \"I can see how little effort is going into these shows now.\"  The \"expert\" used to drive the story was a man named Bill Scheller - a travel writer and journalist. Not a historian. Most of his work is generally about travel (and where to visit and so on).  The closest thing they got to a pirate expert on the show was Pat Croce, the founder of the St. Augustine Pirate Museum and entrepreneur.  Beyond that, no other pirate historians or experts. I'm starting to wonder if most everyone is starting to refuse showing up on that channel in terms of actual historians because of the low reputation the channel is getting?  The biggest winner was probably Pat Croce who got to promote his museum.  The biggest concern of the show seemed to be trying really hard to give the illusion of an interesting story existing when there really wasn't one.  And then they pepper in things that just seem to come out of nowhere.  It's like they're using their producers and writers from their reality shows on the channel to write all their shows now.      \n      \nIf you're interested in a book that is academic and not heavily biased by the author (unlike some books on Captain Kidd), I highly recommend [*Captain Kidd and the War against the Pirates* by Robert Richie](http://www.amazon.com/Captain-Kidd-War-against-Pirates/dp/0674095022/).\n\nEdited for spelling error.",

        "text": "I read and occasionally comment on a blog whose other commenters include a sizable number of self-declared neoreactionaries (see [here](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Neoreactionary_movement) for some background). Most of them are actually reasonable and polite, even if they have some wacky ideas. (Note: I spend a lot of time reading stuff from the political fringes, so my notion of \"reasonable\" may not be precisely calibrated.) One of them, however, writes a \"magazine\" with the most racist \"revisionist\" historical essays I've ever seen - if plagiarizing century-old pamphlets and interjecting the occasional dressed-up version of \"black ppl r evul n dum\" counts as history. (All links are donotlink'd for the obvious reasons.)\n\nSo [here's](http://www.donotlink.com/cy1f) for their attempted defense of colonialism. Much of it is bog-standard, much of it is really, really racist, and most of it I'm not going to touch because other people can deal with it better than I can (I'm just a lowly mathematics student). Instead, let's jump to section 7E, \"Notes on the Congo Free State,\" where he quotes two recent journalists mentioning the Congo Free State, calls them stupid, and then says,\n\n&gt;The lies and stupidity are endless, reader, and I have neither the time nor the patience to go through them one by one and refute them; instead, I simply present a selection from [*The Latest Phase of the Congo Question* (1906)](http://books.google.com/books?id=1m1FAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false). After that, you’ll be in a suitably skeptical mindset to do your own research and make up your own mind.\n\nThe \"lies and stupidity\" seem to be the silly idea that white people in the Congo Free State did anything bad ever. (Also, \"do your own research\"? How many times have we heard that?)\n\nSo how reliable is this source? *The Latest Phase of the Congo Question* was published anonymously in 1906 in Baltimore at the \"Sun Book and Job Printing Office.\" I assume this was a printer-for-hire associated with the *Baltimore Sun*; searching for \"Sun Book and Job Printing Office\" turns up three pages of Google Results, mostly bibliographic citations and random Maryland government records. Searching for the book title turns up two pages of Google results, which comprise several library-catalog entries, a random 4chan thread, and this article itself; in other words, the book seems to have gone completely unnoticed for a century. Surely it should be mentioned that up through 1906, King Leopold II was [sponsoring agents in the United States and Great Britain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State_propaganda_war) to lobby and propagandize for him. Do look at footnote 28 in that Wikipedia article (which admittedly reads like a tenth-grader's final paper), by the way: another book published anonymously in the United States in 1906, written by Leopold's agents. *Very* suspicious.\n\nOur fearless historian quotes a few purported interviews with missionaries and doctors in the Congo and then this big conclusion:\n\n&gt;One point is beyond doubt: a white man has never inflicted such mutilations, nor caused such mutilations to be inflicted, upon living natives as a punishment for failure to bring in taxes nor for any other cause. Deeds of such a kind have never been stated to us by a single witness, and in spite of all our investigations, we have never been able to discover such a case.\n\nThis is dead wrong. We have [photographs](https://www.google.com/search?q=congo+free+state+severed+hands&amp;rlz=1C1OPRB_enUS581US581&amp;es_sm=93&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=775&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PrGSVMj3IOPIsQS2ioLgDw&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ) of Congolese people with severed hands. We have [reports from Catholic priests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State#Humanitarian_disaster) of officials in the Congo Free State giving orders to have Congolese villagers' hands cut off. We have all the primary-source documentation we could possibly need to know that, at the very least, white people in the Congo Free State didn't have their hands clean - and yet we're supposed to disregard all that in favor of a pamphlet published anonymously during the height of Leopold's propaganda war?\n\n(Also worth noting: in 1908 - two years after the publication of *The Latest Phase of the Congo Question* - King Leopold II ordered the Congo Free State archives destroyed, an act that does not inspire confidence in all the laudatory reports that came before.)\n\nI think this sort of badhistory is *dangerous*: it's seductive in the same way as Stormfront copypasta. It presents a bunch of objective-looking and questionably accurate facts arrayed in the service of a false narrative spelled out elliptically, in the hope that readers' brains will be impressed enough by the information that they won't think skeptically or look for further context.\n\nIf you have the stomach for it, look through the rest of our fearless historian's archive! (I did, I'm horrified, and I could use company.) Don't miss his apologias for [King George III](http://www.donotlink.com/cy22), [slavery](http://www.donotlink.com/cy24), and [lynching](http://www.donotlink.com/cy25) while you're at it.",

        "text": "**Introduction: The Revolution, Film, and Ancient Aliens**\n\nPopular media has never been kind to the American War of Independence. When the most famous period movie dealing with the revolution is *The Patriot*, you've got problems. Recently, though, there’s been a spike in television series dealing with the American Revolution. John Adams aired on HBO within the last decade. Currently, AMC airs *Turn: Washington’s Spies* and Fox has *Sleepy Hollow*. \n\nThe History Channel needs no introduction. For a while, it was the Hitler channel. Then it became the channel of crazies, airing programs about Nostradamus, *America Unearthed*, and, of course, the infamous and unfortunately long-running *Ancient Aliens*. \n\nIn recent years, History discarded all pretenses of dealing with its namesake, however bad, and is just another generic cable channel. The current line-up is rife with reality TV shows like Pawn Stars, Ax Men, Ice Road Truckers, and Swamp People precipitated the shift. Though wildly popular, these programs have done little to improve History’s soiled-ass reputation.\n\nSo, alongside this dreck, History’s tried to give itself some class by jumping on the TV drama bandwagon with *Vikings*, *Hatfields and McCoys*, and the *The Bible*. (which, I can only imagine, exists solely to up ratings in the American South and the Midwest) The fringe has been consigned to History’s tinfoil-hat wearing cousin H2. The channel even yanked the popular *Ancient Aliens* off the prime time stage with the proverbial Vaudeville hook. \n\nConsidering both History’s propensity for rehabilitating its image through televised drama, and the American Revolution’s popularity on the small screen, *Sons of Liberty* comes as no surprise. And, also entirely expected, it looks like shit. \n\n**Part 1: *Sons of Liberty* and the Misrepresentation of Popular Revolutionary Sentiment**\n\n[Here’s the teaser.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7QBRTcniS4) This ain’t your dad’s American Revolution: Blaring guitar music, explosions, punching, and shouting announce we’re not in AP US History anymore. This revolution has attitude- It rides a skateboard and wears its cocked hat backwards, man.\n\nThe synopsis, according to the show’s website, is as follows:\n\n“SONS OF LIBERTY, the three-night, six-hour event, follows a defiant and radical group of young men–Sam Adams, John Adams, Paul Revere, John Hancock and Dr. Joseph Warren–as they band together in secrecy to change the course of history and make America a nation… Calling themselves the Sons of Liberty, they light the spark that ignited our revolution. While many of their names have become legendary, this group of young rebels didn’t start off as noble patriots. They were a new generation of young American men from varied backgrounds, struggling to find purpose in their lives. They were looking for equality, but they found something greater: Independence.”^1\n\nRight off the bat, the show reduces the “architects” of American independence to a handful of elites. They may not be the apocryphal politically homogeneous ‘founding fathers’, but the sentiment is damn close. Indeed, by claiming these men, however young and “edgy”, “light the spark that ignited our revolution,” History divorces revolutionary sentiment from its popular origin. As for young- Samuel Adams was in his 40’s during the time of the events depicted (I’m assuming 1768-1775), his second cousin John and Paul Revere were both around 40, John Hancock only slightly younger. Joseph Warren was the youngest of the characters listed, aged 34. And they were hardly the studs that [the show depicts them as.](http://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2014/11/sonsofliberty_gallery_1-P.jpeg) Of the men the show purports to portray, only [Joseph Warren](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/JosephWarrenByCopley.jpeg) came close to History's handsome, Hollywood vision of revolutionary Bostonian leadership. Also, [the guy playing Samuel Adams](http://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2014/12/sonsofliberty_samadams2-E.jpeg) looks suspiciously similar to [the lead from Sleepy Hollow.](http://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/sleepy.jpg) Now, I’m not saying it was Aliens… \n\nSo, we get like three frames of a brawl between regulars and the citizens of Boston in the trailer. JCrew Model Sam Adams proclaims “These are our streets!” to the Redcoats. Fights between soldiers and citizenry were far from unknown. During the first occupation of Boston, garrisoned soldiers looked for work to supplement their meagre pay. At a time when a third of the adult male population in Boston was unemployed, the citizens resented the competition of soldiers who’d work for cheaper wages.^2 On March 3, 1770, a fight broke out between soldiers and dock workers, after one of the former asked for work at Gray’s ropewalk.^3 Instigation by elites was not cause of these brawls, as the teaser seems to imply. Abstract resistance to tyranny certainly existed amongst the populace of Boston and of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in general. Years later, Captain Levi Preston recalled the Lexington alarm: “what we meant in going for those Redcoats was this: we always had governed ourselves and we always meant to. They didn’t mean we should.”^4 However, the urban citizenry also resented the soldiers because of their competition for unskilled labor, which infringed on their livelihoods. \n\nDepictions of popular anti-ministerial or anti-monarchical sentiment in film and TV are generally terrible. The movie *Revolution* and the *John Adams* miniseries depict howling mobs of crazed patriots demolishing effigies, assaulting loyalists and royal officials, and acting the part of \"ye rebels, ye villains\" with gusto. There certainly was a tradition of popular violence during the revolution, on both sides of the Atlantic. However, expressions of popular discontentment were far from senseless. In both England, and the colonies, popular rioters and elites alike invoked the name of John Wilkes, the popular rake and radical, in their cries for liberty. ^5 ^6 Other plebeian actors found their discontentment not through literature, but through negative personal experience with the representatives of governmental authority. These representatives were most often customs, or other royal officials or the equally hated soldiery. One such actor in popular resistance was the young shoemaker George Robert Twelves Hewes. Alfred Young writes: \n\n\"[George Robert Twelves Hewes] was moved to act by personal experiences that he shared with large numbers of other plebeian Bostonians. He seems to have been politicized, not by the Stamp Act, but by the coming of the troops after 1768 and then by things that happened to him, that he saw, or that happened to people he knew. Once aroused, he took action with others of his own rank and condition-- the laboring classes who formed the bulk of the actors at the Massacre, the Tea Party, and the Malcolm affair... These shared experiences were interpreted and focused more likely by the spoken than the written word and as much by his peers at taverns and crowd actions as by leaders in huge public meetings...\"^7\n\nDepictions in popular media, though, deprive the plebeian actors in the Revolution of agency, transforming them into a faceless mob which is either given purpose by an elite leader (see *John Adams*, where the Samuel Adams is mischaracterized not only as an enabler of popular violence, but also as leader of the Boston mob) or simply as a mindless entity with no direction or aim beyond destruction and violence. (See *Revolution*). In this incarnation, the mob is set up as the opponent of the lead character. *John Adams* depicts the titular character as the sole voice of reason and reconciliation, caught between revolutionaries hellbent on violence, and the obstinate British authorities. *Revolution* presents Tony Montana’s pacific humanity in opposition to the violent inhumanity of the mob. \n\n**Continued in *multiple* damn parts:**\n\n**Part 2:** http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2pncav/turning_the_american_revolution_into_action/cmy9hre\n\n**Part 3:** http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2pncav/turning_the_american_revolution_into_action/cmy9ikk\n\n**Part 4:** http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2pncav/turning_the_american_revolution_into_action/cmy9j40\n\n**Conclusion:** http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2pncav/turning_the_american_revolution_into_action/cmy9jsf\n\n***\n\n^1 “About the Series,” *The Sons of Liberty.* A&amp;E Television Networks, 2014. http://www.history.com/shows/sons-of-liberty/about\n\n^2 Christopher Hibbert, *Redcoats and Rebels* (New York, NY: W.W.

        "text": "First off they claim that Caesar himself declared himself Dictator. This is not exactly the case. While they did it because of his undeniable power, still the Senate existed even if weakened.\n\nSecond they claim Brutus (his murderer) was his \"buddy\". Nope. Not really. Not to say they were enemies all the time, they certainly were not, in fact Brutus probably would have been consul in a short time under Caesar's regime. On the other hand, Brutus's mother Servilia had been a long time mistress of Caesar and Brutus idolized his uncle Cato (Servilia's brother) even going as far as publishing a book praising his uncle Cato after his suicide (Caesar's fierce political opponent). Brutus had sided with Pompey in the Civil War and Caesar gave him his usual clemency when he was defeated, and perhaps this guilt over accepting it motivated Brutus to murder because of its contrast to his idol Cato's refusal and suicide as opposed to accepting Caesar's 'mercy'. Anyway, Caesar defended himself from Brutus (and Cicero, who was convinced to write something also praising Cato by Brutus) by publishing his own view of events, but he did not suppress Brutus. Sadly these documents haven't survived.\n\nNow let's move on to the claims that Caesar was 'genocidal' in Gaul. Nope. Imperialistic yes, but genocidal no. Caesar was absolutely ruthless to Gallic tribes who attacked his army unexpectedly, or against those who held out against extended sieges, and especially against those who instigated a wider rebellion or coalition against Rome. In those Caesar sometimes allowed his army to loot, rape, and kill, and then sold the people of the tribe or town into slavery. But we should not singularly condemn Caesar for these atrocities. This was pretty typical of warfare in the ancient world. Moreover it was the typical response of a Roman commander to these problems, and not usually viewed of the people of the time as overly brutal. What is not typical was Caesar's extraordinary clemency, even to the Gauls.  Caesar almost always gave the various Gallic enemies mercy unless things had proceeded too far. He negotiated with tribal leaders to make deals which--while probably in the long-term were one-sided in Rome's favor--also promised protection from the feared tribes of Germany attacking the Gauls. He did not simply come in and kill everyone. \n\nIn at least one example, when a Gallic town surrendered, throwing down their weapons, Caesar ordered his army at night to exit the town and return to the camp and closed the gates, in order to prevent the soldiers from ravaging the women in the night or looting. Unfortunately, some Gallic warriors hiding weapons attacked the Romans in the dark, and Caesar's response was ruthless. The town was stormed and everyone sold into slavery. So you see, the situation was in some ways tragic, but also more complex than that, and it's hard exactly to view the Gauls as entirely innocent and Caesar as entirely Hitler. ",

        "title": "On Pre-1792 \"Nationalism\"",
        "author": "[deleted]",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2pk853/on_pre1792_nationalism/",
        "text": "Was sparked by a recent post in /r/Subredditdrama which broke the camels back on me just posting about this.\n\n[Behold.](http://i.imgur.com/mZ9MWQV.png)\n\nI'll copy and paste what I put in the thread, specifically with regards to his post about proto-nationalism:\n\n-----\n\nYes but what you're describing is commonly referred to as *proto*-nationalism. It's the *concept* existing at the highest stratas of society in intellectual circles but hardly in any applied way. It would be the French Revolution which applied it. While it's tough (and still heavily contested) to come up with a strict definition of Nationalism I find William Carr's most useful:\n\n&gt; *. . .[Nationalism] may be described as a system of values and beliefs which lead a group of people to become conscious of belonging together because of characteristics such as common language, common culture, or subjection to the same ruler and which are capable of mobilizing the group politically.*\n\nIt is that last part, that element of popular participation, which differentiates modern nationalism from what can be described as \"proto-nationalism\" that can be used to describe, say, the Romans or 18th century Britons. The fact is that proto-nationalism can not be called nationalism because it was not a popular mobilization of **the people**, as in, everyone or most of everyone; in fact it's not even close. Prior to the French Revolution any consciousness of separate cultural identities were strictly confined to the ruling elite -- the nobility supported by the clergy. Further and perhaps most importantly these early concepts of cultural belonging and separation were overlaid by a thick bond of universal religion and, when that is combined with being pretty restricted to the Clergy and high nobility, makes it overall pretty irrelevant.\n\nYou can argue until your face turns blue that \"nationalism\" existed in some proto-state for centuries prior to 1789  but **it doesn't matter** because of that class distinction and restriction. I made a similar argument recently in a paper I wrote about German nationalism in the 18th and 19th centuries and its a point William Carr makes quite concisely in his work: It does not matter if we can point to a couple German upper class writers in the 18th century who were clearly writing nationalist works; 95% of the population were not exposed to these writings and more importantly **did not care about these writings and were not affected in any way.** That's just the truth for most of human history. I don't give a shit about what Kant wrote because no one else except his intellectual contemporaries gave a crap about it.\n\nAll of William Carr's work has to basically be given disclaimers at the end (with respect to the Germans, I mean) until near the 1866 Austro-Prussian War saying basically while whatever work is being discussed is certainly an important precursor and would be used as a baseline later on it's still restricted to an upper or middle class and thus 90+% of the population are not exposed to this and frankly don't care about this.\n\nThese people cared about their farm or their trade and if they were obligated to fight for their lord who provided them protection or whatever then they did that but not out of some sense of common unity but out of legal obligation. It would only be until the post-Enlightenment when things like governance providing public education, railroads and telegraphs allowing ideas to flow more freely, and universal sufferage which a system and public thought would be formed where \"the people\" would feel a sense of common unity and obligation to protecting \"the fatherland\" (for example in Germany).\n\nYou're accusing this dude of being contrarian but really it's you my man. Yes you can point to these sporadic writers and intellectuals pre-1792 talking about feminism and universal human rights and national identity (and thus socialism and liberalism and such) but the fact is they were just that -- intellectual thought with an intellectual elite. It would be the French Revolution and most importantly Napoleon's conquests that made a unified Germany possible (mostly through removing the hundreds of seemingly random Germanic states and uniting them under Baden, Bavaria, and Wurttemburg primarily) and began the rise of this thought. It would be the 19th century that saw the first popular support of concepts like liberalism and human rights being spread throughout the middle class and even lower classes with 'clubs' and committees being formed. The 1848 revolts (which were revolts to deconstruct the old feudal structures and replace with liberal concepts of governance and affected 50 countries) were a direct product of 1792 and what happened in 1848 was a totally new phenomenon. \n\nRead the following excerpt:\n\n* . . .The German fatherland has its very own principle of existence precisely in that legitimate variety which is to be sacrificed to the deceptive picture of false patriotism . . . Do not let us chase after castles in the air, let us allow the French their levelling-down concept of equality, their departments, their centralization and their vanity and let us preserve the true knowledge that on the contrary Germany's unity consists precisely that in each part of the German fatherland, even in the smallest part, special life impulses are beating which give nourishment to the heart.*\n\nRead that shit. That was in a *public newspaper in 1833* written by someone in the middle class and spread across the lower classes. That kind of language only existed pre-1792 in the highest of intellectuals like Kant that we study deeply and here it is in 1833 being spread around 'the lower classes' in just a regular old newspaper for a local paper. \n\n**That's why people say the French Revolution 'birthed' things like nationalism and socialism and liberalism and so on.** It didn't literally create these ideas out of thin air but it and the 20 years of near constant war following it (and thus the spreading of its ideas across Europe and the reshaping of Europe as a result of it) created a world in which they spread like wildfire like was never possible before. The 19th century is the age of revolutions commonly for a reason. It was all a product of 1792-1815. To refute this by saying *\"Well these ideas weren't literally created in 1792 out of thin air!\"* is just being intentionally dense.\n\n------\n\nThis is an issue which pops up periodically and it has to do with some flavor of *\"How come the Romans weren't nationalistic?\"* or something to that effect. It's people who take something that is on the surface nationalistic thought and try to use it as some contrarian smoking gun to say *\"SEE?! 1792 DIDN'T INVENT NATIONALISM!\"* The point is, which they are missing entirely though and what I really wanted to get across here for y'all, is that **nationalism isn't about the idea it's about popular participation.** Nobody gives an absolute flying fuck if you can point to Immanuel Kant and see some things that are nationalistic in some way it's about *everyone* getting under it. It would be the *levee en masse*, the concept of mass universal conscription, which gave birth to the idea of popular participation first and that came out of 1792-1797...and thus birthing the concept of 'the nation', everyone not just those in your village, being 'in it together' and popular participation not just being beneficial but absolutely necessary because of how intertwined everyones fates were intertwined. A natural consequence of this is also creating a system in which a symbiotic relation is formed. The people provide popular participation in defense for the government and in return the government gives them popular participation in government along with a list of rights. The state and the common man are now irrevocably intertwined like never before directly because of these things. \n\nSo no the French Revolution didn't invent nationalist thought but it gave the tinder to spread across Europe to the lowest of the low and the highest of the high.",

        "text": "I've talked a bit about some of my textbooks on this sub before. Recently, though, I found the motherlode of terrible textbook-itis. Not only is it bad history - and I mean *really* bad - it's also bad history that I love to talk about. When I saw it, I might have been a bit thrilled in addition to being utterly dismayed. Why thrilled? Well, let's start by [seeing what we're dealing with](http://i.imgur.com/TfBTtY6.jpg) (sorry for the blurriness). [Here's the rest of the page.](http://i.imgur.com/G8HkZlh.jpg) See it? \n\nOh yes. It's a whole page of bad food history. Save me now, for I'm about to faint with glee.\n\nThere's a lot to cover (three separate sections of bad history, to be specific), so for once, I'm going to try and not write a massively long post. Instead, I'm going to cover this one bit at a time over multiple posts. If you object to this, that's your prerogative. However, you're not my mother and can't tell me what to do. So there.\n\nWe'll start with the history of curry. This section isn't the worst (nor is this the worst part of the curry section, but I'll get to that), but let's start by looking at it. The textbook makes the claim that curry existed in England in the 14th century, a claim which I have seen in a number of other places across the internet. It's a claim based on a combination of factors. First, it's based on the fact that, by the 14th century, there is record of a variety of spices being used in English kitchens, such as ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Granted, these were only available to the very wealthy, but with the Norman invasion had come the reintroduction of exotic spices. English people liked these, even if they were expensive. \n\nHow do we know that spices were used, though? Part of our knowledge stems from [this book](http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/foc/), one of the first known English-language cookbooks. \"The Forme of Cury\" specifically references spices like cloves, ginger, and saffron, things that tend not to be native to the British Isles. What this implies, then, is that yes, these spices were available in England prior to British colonialism, albeit to kings, nobles, and other wealthy people. What's interesting, though, is the date the textbook assigns to \"The Forme of Cury.\" It claims the book is from 1377. The date given on the particular manuscript I linked and the date generally agreed on by scholars is around 1390. Granted, it's not known for certain, but it's a tad unclear why, exactly, the textbook would say 1377 when the book is from thirteen years later. \n\nThe more important point to make about it, though, is an etymological one. There's a lot of debate about the etymology of the word \"curry.\" Several Indian languages have some sort of word that sounds a bit like \"curry.\" In Hindi, for instance, one can find the word \"karahi\" which refers to a wok-shaped dish in which the food was cooked. Tamil, though, has the words \"turkuri\" for a seasonal stew and \"kari\" for a gravy-like thing that goes over rice. It's generally agreed upon that the word \"curry\" derives from the Tamil word \"kari.\" This idea is supported by the fact that a 17th century Portuguese cookbook includes a recipe for \"kari,\" meaning the word had started to disseminate into Europe.\n\nWhat about that cookbook I linked, though? It's really the source of the claim that curry is English, or that the word \"curry\" is an English creation. Remember, though, that \"The Forme of Cury\" was written after having been influenced by Norman cooking and imports. New cooking styles and foods weren't the only things the Normans brought with them, however. With the Norman conquest came radical changes to the English language and the importation of French and Romantic words into the language. The word \"cury\" itself derives from some of these French loanwords, being a form of the word \"cuire,\" or to cook. It could be that \"cury\" specifically references a heavily-spiced stew not unlike those found in India. More likely, however, \"cury\" refers to cooking, how to cook, and how to cook well. Using the name of \"The Forme of Cury\" to argue that curry came from England or that the word \"curry\" is English is rather bad linguistics and bad history. \n\nIn case you were wondering, the actual first curry recipe in an English cookbook is in 1747 with a cookbook called \"To Make Curry the India Way.\" Here, the curry recipe is for a stew with a little bit of rice in it rather than the usual Indian form of rice with sauce, but it does more or less resemble a curry from India.\n\nWhat's the actual history of curry, then? Does it secretly come from England? No. That's silly. \n\nThere is archaeological evidence of curry being eaten [more than 4500 years ago](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2013/01/indus_civilization_food_how_scientists_are_figuring_out_what_curry_was_like.html) in the Indus Valley. Spices such as mustard, fennel, ginger, cumin, turmeric, and tamarind have been found in ancient mortars and pestles, and evidence of ginger and turmeric on ancient cow teeth. Analysis of soil in ancient villages, too, shows grains like rice, millet, and barley all mixed together and sometimes with these spices. While it's difficult to know exactly what these ancient curries were like, the fact that they have roughly the same spices as modern curries and roughly the same grains does imply something about what they might have been like. Certainly, though, it's safe to say that people in India were eating curries long before the English were.\n\nThis doesn't mean curries are some magical eternal thing, though. With the introduction of chillies from Mexico and South America in the 18th and 19th centuries, curries underwent a transformation. They became spicier and incorporated this new ingredient, creating something new that caught on like wildfire in Europe. Indeed, curries continue to change and evolve based on the introduction of new ingredients and new cooking styles. A curry in a Scottish chippy, for instance, is very different from one prepared on the streets of Lahore, but they're both recognisably curry.\n\nThe history of curry in Europe, too, is an interesting one. As I said, there is a record of \"kari\" in a Portuguese cookbook, but it really caught on during the height of European imperialism, and especially during the British occupation of India. In 1809, for instance, [the first curry restaurant in the UK opened in London], though this is more a sign of the popularity of curry than of its new introduction (the restaurant also went bankrupt within three years). By the 19th century, there are records of curries being so popular that British people would eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and an 1852 cookbook insisted that no dinner was complete without a curry on the table. However, by the early 20th century, curry was falling out of fashion and didn't recover until after WWII with an influx of Indian and Bangladeshi immigrants. As cheap curry became widely available, though, it exploded in popularity, becoming a staple of British cuisine and a national food. Its origins may not be British, but it can't be denied that it is currently an important British food.\n\nBut it's definitely not British in origin. That's just stupid. \n\nSources: I definitely recommend [this article](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07409710.2011.544208#.VJDX9DGUdrM) beyond the stuff I cited in the post if you're interested in the dissemination of curry in the UK during the 18th century. Which honestly sounds like strangely specific history, but hey, I think it's fun.",

So I've picked one minor thing one dude said offhandedly and I'm going to beat on it.\n\nIn the midst of a well thought out and mature discussion fueled by the POWER OF INTELLIGENCE, JnrEngineer decisively points out that \"technology made it extremely easy for the Nazis to invade England\" and the only reason it didn't happen was because [nebulous nebulous mutter mutter rule britannia.](http://np.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2pdntx/an_elderly_british_gentleman_of_83_arrived_in/cmwqac6) It was presumably, based on the context he mentions it in, as easy as invading France but the UK *didn't let it happen* making them better than France and also remember Agincourt we whomped you so checkmate, suckers.\n\nThough I have not the gumption to power this rebuttal with intelligence, I shall attempt to make do by powering it with an obnoxious smugness and a put-on sense of intellectualism. Here we go.\n\nOperation Sea Lion was the German name for the planned invasion of the UK. Clearing the way for such an invasion was part of the goals of the air war that was the Battle of Britain. It was not 'extremely easy' technologically to pull off, and in deference to JnrEngineer a part of this was because the UK had a large and powerful fleet and an airforce that the Germans feared might be capable of wreaking havoc on an invasion fleet if it was not dealt with. Further, the Germans never *managed* to deal with either of these issues and lost the Battle of Britain, so the UK successfully managed to make an invasion unfeasible due to their ability to resist it militarily. \n\nHowever, the invasion itself would have been difficult under the best of times. It was *not* comparable to a land invasion, no matter what our friend JnrEngineer seems to believe. The Germany Armed Forces were incredibly unprepared for an invasion by sea at the time. Their navy could not offer adequate protection unless the UK's navy was absolutely unable to intervene and that was a pipe dream at best. They did not have anything close to specialized landing equipment and the craft they could land men with were huge, unwieldy, often unarmored, mostly re-purposed civilian equipment and generally unsuited to effectively dropping off men in a combat zone. They had no way of unloading vehicles, meaning they would need to secure a large landing zone, under fire, without armored support, in order to bring in the armored support they'd probably need to successfully do that in the first place. Specialized craft, specialized tanks and specialized equipment would all need to be developed, tested and then used for the first time under fire during the invasion, all within a short space of time and whilst the Germans did attempt to develop some, it took a tremendous amount of time and only a few craft were ever put into production. The German Army was not equipped and did not have the resources to retool a significant part of their army into an invasion fleet and had they gone through with it it would have placed massive strains on their industry, logistical ability and even their effectiveness as a fighting force. It was a bad, overly difficult idea and they did not go for it.\n\nIn a more general sense, invasion fleets in WW2 were large and expensive. Armies needed to find a way to bring in some cases millions of tons of supplies over the sea, which could only be successfully done in the long term with near dominance of the area in both the water and the air. Then, when they got there, they needed to find a way to unload all these supplies. If you're supplying a particularly huge invasion force, you'll need a port and hope to hell the enemy haven't destroyed all the viable ones. If they have, you need specialized equipment and a lot of boats - neither of which the Germans had - to create your own temporary ports, followed by an on-site logistics system capable of sorting and transporting these supplies from the ships.\n\nOh, and if you're the Germans and you're invading Great Britain, you need to do this in a hostile country with an armed and belligerent population that has a significantly shorter supply line which is going to be much harder to attack or disrupt than yours. In short, the technology to successfully pull off a massive invasion was not lying around to use for all countries in the early stages of the war and much of it was only developed in its later stages. It was not easy to invade any country amphibiously during WW2 at any time. Each attempt was a huge undertaking, and it was one the Germans simply could not manage.",

I’m pretty sure I’m the only one who has any idea what they’re talking about.\n\n\nI’ll admit, it took me a while to understand what the hell was going on here. At first I thought people simply didn’t understand that textiles were the major driving force of the Industrial Revolution. It turns out many people think the Second Industrial Revolution is the only Industrial Revolution (IR). \n\nThe theme is largely the same, so I’ll pick two  posts.\n\n&gt;/r/badhistory here. The US industrial revolution wasn't built on the agrarian economy of the South\n\nIronically *I’m* called out for my bad history. Anyway, it was. As Red Sox fans know, (the Lowell Spinners) Lowell, MA was the site of the beginning of the IR in America. Industrial mills popped up in the city in the 1830’s. And can we guess what those mills produced? That’s right, cotton textiles. And do we know where that cotton came from? Unfortunately, cotton does not grow particularly well in New England. Indeed looking at [this map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_production_in_the_United_States#mediaviewer/File:Map_07-M189_Acres_of_Upland_Cotton_Harvested_as_Percent_of_Harvested_Cropland_Acreage,_U.S.,_2007..gif), it doesn’t do so well anywhere north of Virginia. \nSo they took it from cotton grown in the South by…Black slaves. That’s right, the entire United States (other than the slaves) benefitted massively from enslaved labor.\n\n&gt;The vast majority of heavy industry (you know, the kind that came into power due to the industrial revolution) was located in the North, especially in the rust belt. Why do you think its called the rust belt?\n\nThis is the SECOND IR. The manufacturing in the FIRST IR was limited to the Northeast and concentrated in New England. This is largely because the fast moving rivers necessary for power at the time can’t be found in the South or what was then known as the West. For example the mighty Mississippi meanders along at 1 mph (1.5 in commie lengths/hr) at the head and 3 mph (4.5 commies/hr) at its delta. And there are only two major rapids along the entire 2,300 miles (3,700 commie lengths).\n\n\n&gt;Cotton was already in major decline at the start of the Civil War, and the war completely killed it off. Europe went to India and Egypt for their cotton due to the unreliability of cotton shipments breaking the Union blockade of southern ports.\n\nThis is ridiculous. Slavery was booming at the start of the Civil War. Simply put, slave labor is efficient; getting one lash per pound under your daily quota is a big motivator. Not until the mechanized cotton picker of the late *1930’s* was the speed of slaves improved upon. And the South was rich as hell. It’s per capita wealth wasn’t matched by Spain and Italy until 1940.

        "text": "Hello, and welcome to my first /r/badhistory post!\n\nLast night, I had the pleasure of going to see Exodus: Gods and Kings. My friend and I were actually pretty pumped, as we are huge fans of mindless historical action-dramas (before seeing it, we had, in our hype, dubbed it “Jewish 300”). Instead, what we got was a surprisingly faithful retelling of the timeless Biblical story, with barely a drop of blood spilled in action sequences (excusing the, well, you know, plague where the entire river turned to blood). This review, however, does not concern itself with Biblical accuracy or even the historicity of the story itself. The moratorium will be respected. \n\nNo, no – today we are concerned with the representation of Egypt during the reign of the Pharaohs Ramesses II and his father, Seti I.\n\nThe film opens by stating the date and location: Memphis, 1300 BCE. It shows [Moses and Ramesses]( http://flickpop.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/exodus.jpg?w=1200) as young adults, close relatives and friends, both living in the royal palace. There are two major problems with this – Memphis was not the capital during the reign of Seti I or Ramesses II. The capital had been at Thebes since the beginning of the Middle Kingdom period (although Ramesses would later move it to the humbly-named Pi-Ramesses). The second issue is with the date. Namely, that if the movie was actually taking place at the date stated, Ramesses would be a rambunctious 3 year-old. As adorable as that would be, Ramesses and Moses are both clearly adults in the first scene of the film.\n\nIn the opening, Pharaoh Seti (who shouldn’t even be Pharaoh yet, having begun his reign either 6 or 10 years after this film’s start date) is discussing war with the nefarious Hittites. They plan to engage them at Kadesh. Now, I already know what you’re going to say – “wasn’t the famous battle of Kadesh during the reign of Ramesses II?” – and you would be correct. However, there actually was a lesser known battle of Kadesh during Seti’s reign, so the movie gets off here. It doesn’t get away free, though. Historically, Seti led the campaign himself (although he brought young Ramesses along for the ride), but in the movie he sends Ramesses and Moses to fight while he remains in Egypt. \n\nBefore they leave, though they must consult the entrails, and here is where we meet one of our major supporting characters, a priestess who I don’t recall having a name. This by itself is not a problem; women in the priesthood were common, especially for female deities. However, this character isn’t just in one scene, or associated with just one god – throughout the movie, every single time Seti or Ramesses needs religious advice or a ritual performed, this woman is leading it. Hey Ramesses, maybe the reason she can’t turn the blood back to water is because that’s not even her job, yo. Go get some other priests and priestesses, this lady can’t communicate with all the gods.\n\nAlso before they leave, Seti gives Ramesses and Moses a pair of swords ([One, seen here](http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/filmchat/files/2014/08/exodus-empire-mosesjoshua.jpg)) with each other’s names on them, so that they will always remember each other. These are short straight swords, which is fine. Not every Egyptian sword has to be a Khopesh. However, these are very clearly made of iron, or perhaps even steel. 1300 BCE was still firmly in the Bronze Age for Egypt, and even after iron became common knowledge, the Egyptians still primarily used bronze for their metalwork up until their conquest by the Assyrians in the 7th century BCE. Iron is everywhere in this movie, and blacksmiths are even shown hammering it on modern-style anvils.\n\nAnyway, let’s talk about the battle. Everything’s going good, Ramesses and Moses are directing their troops (it should be commanded by Seti, but we’re past that). They’re planning to charge the Hittites while they’re unprepared in their camp. In the middle of some random desert canyon. This is the Battle of Kadesh right? Where the hell is Kadesh? Anyway, a Hittite scout sees the Egyptian army approaching, and gallops on horseback to the camp to warn his countrymen.\n\nWait.\n\nHorseback? What?\n\n…\n\nIs that a saddle? And… And… ARE THOSE STIRRUPS?\n\nYes, here we have reached one of the absolute worst sins of this movie. Horseback riding. Saddles. STIRRUPS. The saddle would not be invented for 600 years after this film, by the Assyrians, and the modern stirrup wouldn’t be invented for nearly 1,000 years, in East Asia. And yet, here it shows the Hittites scrambling from their camp to form up for battle, stepping in to the stirrups of their horses... Ugh. I mean, really. The Hittites were some of the greatest charioteers in ancient history, and yet here they’re depicted almost looking like a steppe horde. \n\n[I couldn't find a screenshot of the Hittites, so here are some Egyptians... also with stirrups and saddles.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tl5E1hyYrFQ/VG4VgTAnXVI/AAAAAAAABac/oG1ceDOHjQc/s1600/exodus-gods-and-kings-010_t1_0730_v0238_left_R_CROP_rgb.jpg)\n\nThankfully, the Hittites do have some infantry, who quickly form up in to a spear wall to resist the Egyptian chariot charge… to which the Egyptians, intelligently jump over them. [In chariots.](http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/filmchat/files/2014/11/exodus-3d-13.png)\n\n[I'm not kidding. They jumped over a spear wall. With chariots.](http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/filmchat/files/2014/11/vlcsnap-2014-11-10-10h44m53s159-1024x435.png)\n\n…Anyway, after this the infantry collide, and politely organize themselves in to a giant mass of standard Hollywood 1-on-1 duels. Ramesses gets knocked off his chariot, and is saved by Moses, thereby fulfilling the entrails-prophecy from the priestess scene, and setting the stage for Ramesses later paranoia. Kadesh is captured, supposedly (we never get to see the city that is supposedly the location of this battle), and Ramesses and Moses return to Egypt as victorious heroes. This is all in the first 20 minutes or so of the film, the rest follows the biblical story fairly faithfully, and I won't comment on it.\n\nI have very few complaints about the rest of the movie, but as I already stated, stirrups, saddles, and iron are everywhere. The movie is fairly good if you can turn your brain off for these egregious historical errors, and I would recommend seeing it if you enjoy movies like Gladiator. \n\nIt’s basically just Jewish Gladiator.\n\n***EDIT:*** A lot of people seem to be interpreting my pointing out the bad history in this movie as a condemnation of it. PLEASE STOP. I thoroughly enjoyed this film despite this inaccuracies, as having bad history doesn't effect the writing or the acting. ***The acting in particular is extremely good.*** Please stop acting like this movie is terrible if you haven't even seen it and are just going off this post. I wouldn't have gone through the trouble to write this post if I hadn't enjoyed the movie.\n\nSources: \n\n-\tWheeled Vehicles and Ridden Animals in the Ancient Near East, M.A. Littauer and J.H.

        "text": "Full post:\n\n\"It is absolutely insane when you think about it. Hitler was THE most popular leader in Europe before World War 2. He lead Germany to an economic boom the likes of which had never before been seen in history. Germany experienced an explosion in the arts, sciences, literature, military, philosophy,and in a couple years went from bankrupt slum to World Superpower. Never has a nation improved so fast in the History of mankind.\nHitler's supposed negative actions are focused on way more than his counterparts. Stalin killed WAYYYY more people than anybody ever claimed Hitler did. The US was still hanging black people in the South(Harry Truman was a member of the KKK in 1920's, look it up), and had Japanese in Concentration Camps. The Japanese Raped the whole of China(e.g. Nanking). We firebombed Berlin, and Tokyo's civilians, killing 100,000 people in Tokyo alone , and then Nuked Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Why is Hitler so vilified?\n\nIt all started with events like the \"Katyn Massacre\",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre[1] which was an event where 10,000's of people were murdered by the soviets. They blamed the Nazis. Everyone blamed the Nazis. Until 1990 when Russia revealed that the Soviets actually did it and then blamed the Nazis. FDR and Churchill had to pretend like the Nazis were the murderers from an early stage in the war, or else they had to admit their ally(Stalin) was a murdering psychopath(and that they entered WW2 for no moral reason). The myth compounded, and Jewish suffering became the \"focal point\", and WW2 became known as the Holocaust. Most of the people who died were not Jewish(undisputed fact). Most of the atrocities were not committed by Nazis(undisputed fact). It gets lost in History that Hitler had respect for Britain, and did not engage in \"total warfare\" until after Germany's civilians had been target by the RAF many times.\n\nThe \"elite\" (or Jewish elite, or Zionists, or Rothschild) that rule the world now are the exact people that Hitler was against(he even specifically called out the Rothschilds, some of whom are German Jews). Hitler worked alongside many religions(including 30 countries that fought alongside the 3rd Reich). He wasn't racist, or against any religion, and applauded races improving themselves and taking pride in their own race's heritage(He even gave a Qu'ran with swastika on it to an Islamic Leader in Africa as a sign of tolerance). He did not want to conquer the world and make everyone Aryan. He did not want to rid the world of Jews. He wanted every race to be efficient, and improve themselves, and to treat each other fairly(not hold guns to countries heads with debts, like was done to Germany after WW1 at Treaty of Versailles, and to other nations by International Bankers). Many(but not all) people heralded the Nazis as liberators when their tanks rolled into their towns. Why did so many people willingly join Hitler's army(including Poles, Soviets, Japanese, Muslims etc.) if he was a racist murderer who hated everyone who was not Aryan? Why did Germans fight to the last bullet? Because they loved him, and he actually cared about the people, unlike the International Bankers.\" [Link](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2p277o/everybody_complains_about_the_international/)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOh boy. I'll try to ignore the blatant conspiracy stuff (after all this isn't /r/conspiratard) and focus on the badhistory. \n\n1. \n\n&gt;He lead Germany to an economic boom the likes of which had never before been seen in history.\n\nThe miraculous German recovery has been widely discredited in the past. Hitler appointed Hjalmar Schacht to run the economy, and basically said 'do what you want'. After all, Hitler himself said \"the economy is of secondary importance\". When Schacht got the economy up and running again, Hitler chose the side of Göring and destroyed the economy in a matter of years, and in general economic historians agree that even without a war the German economy would've defaulted within several years. From wiki:\n\n&gt;Between 1933 and 1939, **the total revenue was 62 billion marks, whereas expenditure (at times made up to 60% by rearmament costs) exceeded 101 billion**, thus creating a huge deficit and national debt (reaching 38 billion mark in 1939) coinciding with the Kristallnacht and intensified persecutions of Jews and the outbreak of the war.\n\nThere's quite an extensive [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany) on the subject with more details. Some quotes from that article:\n\n&gt;However, while Germany was successful at rearmament, production of agriculture and consumer goods stagnated, and standards of living fell. Production of agriculture, particularly, rarely exceeded 1913 levels.\n\n&gt;The German balance of payments went strongly negative. In 1933-36 exports declined by 9% in value while imports rose by 9%.[42] In the spring and summer of 1936, the reduced availability of foreign currency constrained imports of raw materials, with some key stockpiles falling to only two months' production.[43] Dr. Schacht informed the War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg that lack of lead and copper prevented fulfilling his requests for increased military production.\n\nAfter a while, a conflict arose between Schacht (who wanted *less* military spending) and Göring and others (the actual Nazis) argued for *more* military spending. Hitler sided with the latter:\n\n&gt;Since the outbreak of the French Revolution, the world has been moving with ever increasing speed toward a new conflict, the most extreme solution of which is called** Bolshevism, whose essence and aim, however, are solely the elimination of those strata of mankind which have hitherto provided the leadership and their replacement by worldwide Jewry**. No state will be able to withdraw or even remain at a distance from this historical conflict...It is not the aim of this memorandum to prophesy the time when the untenable situation in Europe will become an open crisis. I only want, in these lines, to set down my conviction that this crisis cannot and will not fail to arrive and that it is Germany's duty to secure her own existence by every means in face of this catastrophe, and to protect herself against it, and that from this compulsion there arises a series of conclusions relating to the most important tasks that our people have ever been set. For a victory of Bolshevism over Germany would not lead to a Versailles treaty, but to the final destruction, indeed the annihilation of the German people...**I consider it necessary for the Reichstag to pass the following two laws: 1) A law providing the death penalty for economic sabotage and 2) A law making the whole of Jewry liable for all damage inflicted by individual specimens of this community of criminals upon the German economy, and thus upon the German people.** (wikipedia lists Dawidowicz 1976, p. 32 as a source for this quote)\n\nTruly an economic mastermind.\n\nIn conclusion, the economic boom really wasn't all that remarkable, and Hitler really didn't have a lot to do with it. In my opinion, the economy was able to grow *despite* Hitler running the country.\n\n&gt; Germany experienced an explosion in the arts, sciences, literature, military, philosophy,and in a couple years went from bankrupt slum to World Superpower.\n\nAll of my what?\n\nHere are some scientists who were forced to leave Germany.\n\n* Albert Einstein \n* Sigmund Freud \n* Otto Loewi\n* Max Bergmann\n\nThe [Bauhaus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus), a world famous art school at the time, was forced to close by the Nazis for being too liberal and too socialist. Their [main building](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Bauhaus_weimar.jpg) was designed in 1906, just to give you an idea of how good they actually were.\n\nAgain from wiki, here's a list of writers and artists that were simply banned in Germany:\n\n**Painters**\n\nMax Beckmann\n\nOskar Kokoschka\n\nKurt Schwitters\n\n**Musicians**\n\nPaul Hindemith\n\nOtto Klemperer\n\nHanns Jelinek\n\nErnst Toch\n\nArnold Schönberg\n\nRichard Tauber\n\nHanns Eisler (composer)\n\nFriedrich Hollander (composer)\n\nKurt Weill (composer)\n\nFranz Waxman (composer)\n\nKarol Rathaus (composer)\n\nMicha Spoliansky (composer)\n\n**Architects**\n\nWalter Gropius (founder of Bauhaus)\n\nLudwig Mies van der Rohe\n\nMarcel Breuer\n\n**Writers**\n\nBrecht\n\nHasenclever\n\nHeinrich Mann\n\nRemarque\n\nHanns Heinz Ewers\n\nBruno Frank\n\nLeo Perutz\n\nJakob Wassermann\n\nStefan Zweig\n\nDaniel Gross\n\nMoses Schorr\n\nZofia Ameisenowa\n\nJakub Appenschlak\n\nSzymon Askenazy\n\nMaksymilian Baruch\n\nAlexander Kraushar\n\nBruno Jasieński\n\nAleksander Alfred Konar\n\nJanusz Korczak\n\nAdolf Rudnicki\n\nAntoni Słonimski\n\nJulian Tuwim\n\nBruno Winawer\n\nJózef Wittlin\n\nThat's as far as the explosion in the arts, sciences and literature are concerned. Militarywise, they were on top during the first years of WWII, because they spent all their money on military equipment so I don't see this as much of an achievement.\n\n2.\n\n&gt;Never has a nation improved so fast in the History of mankind. \n\nI'd say [Japan's post WWII growth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_post-war_economic_miracle) begs to differ. And Italy in the renaissance etc. \n\n3.\n\n&gt; Stalin killed WAYYYY more people than anybody ever claimed Hitler did.\n\nAND THAT'S WHY WE ALL LOVE STALIN :D\n\nYeah good old genocide olympics. \n\n&gt;The US was still hanging black people in the South(Harry Truman was a member of the KKK in 1920's, look it up)\n\nAccording to [this site](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingyear.html) 21 African-Americans were lynched during world war II. Which obviously is 21 too many, but saying those atrocities are even remotely comparable to an industrial genocide is ridiculous.\n\nAs far as Truman's membership of the KKK is concerned, in a local election against 2 other Dems who were members of the KKK, he paid a 10$ membership fee to the KKK as well. He was never an active member and even refused to do what they wanted.\n\n&gt;and had Japanese in Concentration Camps.\n\nAgain, this was horrible, as is demonstrated by the weekly /r/todayilearned post about it. On the bright side though, the Japanese were never gassed in those camps, so that's kind of different from German concentration camps I suppose. Don't know too much about the living conditions there though.\n\n&gt; The Japanese Raped the whole of China(e.g. Nanking).\n\nYes. Also irrelevant to how we should judge Hitler.\n\n&gt;It all started with events like the \"Katyn Massacre\",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre[1] which was an event where 10,000's of people were murdered by the soviets. They blamed the Nazis. Everyone blamed the Nazis. Until 1990 when Russia revealed that the Soviets actually did it and then blamed the Nazis. FDR and Churchill had to pretend like the Nazis were the murderers from an early stage in the war, or else they had to admit their ally(Stalin) was a murdering psychopath(and that they entered WW2 for no moral reason).\n\nThis is correct. Apart from the \"It all started\" thing that is, since that [\"man of the year\"](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760539,00.html) article neonazis love to talk about was written in 1938 called Hitler incredibly dangerous. And of course, things like the [Kristallnacht](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht) happened in 1938, and Hitler invaded Poland in 1939 and massacred a whole bunch of people there too. \n\n&gt; The myth compounded, and Jewish suffering became the \"focal point\", and WW2 became known as the Holocaust. \n\nOkay, just going to focus on the 'logic' here.\n\n- Stalin committed the Katyn massacre\n- Western powers covered it up\n- Ergo, jewish suffering becomes the focal point\n\n?\n\n&gt;Most of the people who died were not Jewish(undisputed fact).\n\nHooray?\n\n&gt;Most of the atrocities were not committed by Nazis(undisputed fact).\n\nI'm pretty sure the industrial genocide of millions of people counts as millions of points in the genocide olympics game, which again doesn't mean atrocities weren't commited on al sides.\n\n&gt;It gets lost in History that Hitler had respect for Britain, \n\nDoes anyone know more about this? Either way it's completely irrelevant.\n\n&gt;and did not engage in \"total warfare\" until after Germany's civilians had been target by the RAF many times.\n\nThis is WWII 101. For details about the relations between the western world and Hitler, read the times article I linked. It's actually really interesting.\n\n&gt;All these events were shocking to nations which had defeated Germany on the battlefield only 20 years before, but nothing so terrified the world as the ruthless, methodical, Nazi-directed events which during late summer and early autumn threatened a world war over Czechoslovakia. When without loss of blood he reduced Czechoslovakia to a German puppet state, forced a drastic revision of Europe's defensive alliances, and won a free hand for himself in Eastern Europe by getting a \"hands-off\" promise from powerful Britain (and later France), Adolf Hitler without doubt became 1938's Man of the Year.\n\n&gt;Most other world figures of 1938 faded in importance as the year drew to a close. Prime Minister Chamberlain's \"peace with honor'' seemed more than ever to have achieved neither. An increasing number of Britons ridiculed his appease-the-dictators policy, believed that nothing save abject surrender could satisfy the dictators' ambitions.\n\n&gt;Among many Frenchmen there rose a feeling that Premier Daladier, by a few strokes of the pen at Munich, had turned France into a second-rate power. Aping Mussolini in his gestures and copying triumphant Hitler's shouting complex, the once liberal Daladier at year's end was reduced to using parliamentary tricks to keep his job.\n\nSo I'd say Hitler's total warfare, or atleast the path to it, started well before the RAF killed German civilians (does anyone know when this even happened?)\n\n&gt;Hitler worked alongside many religions(including 30 countries that fought alongside the 3rd Reich).\n\n\nWell, except for killing millions of people from a single religion that is.\n\n&gt;He wasn't racist, or against any religion, and applauded races improving themselves and taking pride in their own race's heritage(He even gave a Qu'ran with swastika on it to an Islamic Leader in Africa as a sign of tolerance). \n\nYeah not even gonna bother here. Hitler considered every non-Germanic race to be inferior...\n\n&gt;He did not want to rid the world of Jews.\n\nThat's why he was so obsessed about them? Also that's really [exactly what he wanted to do](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Solution). Some small pieces of evidence for this include the Holocaust, the dozens of concentration camps, the use of [Einsatzgruppen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen) etc.\n\n&gt;Many(but not all) people heralded the Nazis as liberators when their tanks rolled into their towns. Why did so many people willingly join Hitler's army(including Poles, Soviets, Japanese, Muslims etc.)\n\nUhm, as far as I'm aware the people who actually *removed* the nazis from villages were the liberators. I can assure you no one in Belgium considered the Nazis to be liberators when they were conquering Belgium. \n\nThis concludes the monthly episode of 'Good Guy Hitler'\n\n\nEDIT: sorry, I missed OP's edit.\n\n\n\n&gt;\"The struggle between the people and the hatred amongst them is being nurtured by **very specific interested parties**. It is a **small rootless international cliqu**e that is turning against each other that does not want them to have peace. It is the people who are at home both nowhere and everywhere, who do not have anywhere a soil which they have grown up who feel at home everywhere. They are the only ones who can be addressed as international elements, because they conduct their business everywhere the the people cannot follow them.\" \n\nThis is literally a quote from a speech where peaceful non-racist Hitler was yet again raging against the jews.\n\n\n",

        "text": "There are many misconceptions about Korean history out there in the world (and especially on the internet). Like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/2oom15/11_year_old_attends_12_hagwons/cmp9f98). This particular poster thinks that serial killers are a new thing in Korea, perhaps a product of the South Korean education system. This is a misconception, and one which I will happily debunk.\n\nOne problem with looking at the history of serial killers is that they're not necessarily always well-recorded. Forensic technology and crime investigation techniques were not as good in, say, 1200 CE as they are today, and so it would be more difficult to link multiple murders to each other. Indeed, much of why the number of serial killers active in America is likely due to the fact that improved forensic techniques make it more possible to link crimes together rather than dealing with them in isolation and recording them as separate, unknown killers. \n\nNow, that said, we do have evidence of serial killers who were active prior to the development of more modern forensic techniques. The ones we do know about include people like [Liu Pengli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Pengli), mass murderers who remain well known because of how effectively and brutally they killed. We also know about assassins such as [Locusta of Gaul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locusta), known for killing important people. We even know about rulers who were certainly psychopathic killers and who killed many people secretly (such as [Zu Shenatir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zu_Shenatir)). They all qualify as serial killers of varying forms, at least by the FBI's definition of a serial killer. \n\nOne interesting thing, though, is that we don't have records of non-nobility serial killers before a certain point. It could be that non-nobility people simply weren't serial killers, but what's more likely is that records of these non-noble serial killers weren't kept or - even more likely - didn't survive. One of the earliest commoner serial killers we know of was [Peter Stumpp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stumpp) (or Stumpf or Stube or any other variation on the name), a serial killer who killed and ate people in Cologne in the late 16th century. He was known as the \"Werewolf of Bedburg,\" and his execution was particularly brutal, with him being put on a wheel, having his flesh and limbs ripped from his body, his remaining bones broken, and his head removed before his body was burned. This suggests that people didn't like serial killers. His story is muddled somewhat, though, by the fact that he was a Protestant in a Catholic-controlled area during a time when that wasn't really an acceptable thing to be. It's likely that the very harsh response to him was a response not only to the crimes he'd committed, but also to the fact that he was a Protestant. In any case, that we know about it at all is itself special. All information about him and the case is based on a pamphlet published in London in 1590 - all other original documents were destroyed during the various wars that affected the region. The lesson to take from Peter Stumpp (other than don't be a Protestant serial killer) is that simply because there aren't records of serial killers doesn't mean there weren't serial killers. Rather, it means that records are fragile things, and that records of non-noble people weren't always as meticulously kept. \n\nOne of the first modern serial killers might be [Pierre Lacenaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Fran%C3%A7ois_Lacenaire), a Frenchman in the early 19th century who killed at least two people (only making him arguably a serial killer, depending on one's definition). What makes him special and memorable, though, is that he [wrote his memoirs while waiting for his execution](http://www.leboucher.com/pdf/lacenaire/lacenaire.pdf), something which modern serial killers are a bit notorious for, at least in one form or another. Beginning around this time, we start to see more and more common, everyday people as serial killers emerging in the historical record. Quite simply, as the history of common people becomes more accessible, so too does the history of ordinary serial killers. \n\nWhat about Korea, though? When does Korea have its first serial killer? Once again, it's difficult to know exactly when because of how records are kept and crimes are investigated. However, South Korea's first *known* serial killer is the [Hwaeseong Killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwaseong_serial_murders), a killer who was active from 1986 to 1991. He raped and killed at least ten women. This case is particularly infamous in South Korea both in the fact that the killer was never caught and in the fact that it is one of the first in which it was known that there was a serial killer at work. However, it is well worth noting that the case isn't exactly recent. Indeed, it's attracted controversy because South Korea's statute of limitations means that even if the case is solved, it can no longer be prosecuted. Of course, because the killer was never caught, it's difficult to know what exactly his motives were. However, I think it's safe to say that the modern Korean education system is probably not to blame for this particular killer's proclivities.\n\nThere have been other serial killers in Korean history as well. The most recent one to have been convicted was [Kang Ho-Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_Ho-sun) in 2010. This could qualify as recent, I suppose, but seeing as Kang is currently 45 years old, he also can't really be said to be a product of the modern Korean education system. \n\nAll that said, it can't be denied that since industrialising, there has indeed been a rise in the number of Korean serial killers. The reason behind this, though, is more likely to be the fact that crimes can be better linked and better forensic techniques can be used to establish a criminal's behaviour. Sure, the greater availability of people to kill will play a role as well, but let's not automatically assign responsibility for criminal behaviour to whatever social phenomena we don't like. Criminals - and serial killers especially - are much more complicated than that.\n\nEDIT: /u/taylororo pointed out an earlier serial killer [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2p184e/korean_serial_killers_and_you_a_primer_on_how_the/cmsm2cs) from 1975. Dae-du Kim was arrested and convicted of 17 murders. Prior to that, there was a possible serial killer in 1928, though that depends on how you define \"serial killer.\"",

First three top comments, besides one of them saying the Vietnam War wasn't really around communism (lol), aren't too terrible. Then comes the fun stuff. \n\n&gt;The US failed to recognize that Ho Chi Minh was pro-American and also strongly nationalistic\n\nStrongly nationalistic? Yes, absolutely. Pro-American? No, there is no way. But still not terribly awful. Here's where it gets fun. \n\n&gt;fter world war ll vietnam (How Chi Minh) asked to be reconized as an indepentant nation and perfered a government that was democratic in nature.\n\nI suppose the various communist political movements in Saigon and the motherfucking Viet Minh weren't communist. Yes, I am sure they preferred a government that was democratic in nature. \n\n&gt;H(N)ow Chi Minh had no other choice but to go communist as Russia would then acknowledge that Vietnam was an indepentant country with rights\n\nOnce again, the Viet Minh and the various communistic political movements were.. you guessed it... already communist. Ho Chi Minh was not forced to turn to communism, he voluntarily went to Russia to be formally schooled in it in the 20s. \n\n&gt;When France finally decided that Vietnam was a losing enterprise for them and it wasted their resources, they pulled out of Vietnam.\n\nI guess the battle of Dien Bien Phu had absolutely nothing to do with that, huh. You know, the battle where the Viet Minh whipped the French in open warfare. That totally didn't factor into the decision, nooooooooo. I think OP could possibly have meant Dien Bien Phu when he is talking about a losing enterprise and wasting resources, but given his ignorance of the Viet Minh being a communist organization I sincerely doubt it. \n\n&gt;It was because Vietnam was a huge producer of food that America wanted to foil Chinas plans. Also we wanted a presence in the region to keep an eye on China.\n\nYes. America was ultimately concerned about China. Not the policy of containment. Sure. Yeah. \n\n&gt;Viet Minh was the name adopted by Ho Chi MINH to disguise Communism, known in Vietnam at the time as \"the three NO ideology\"\n\nThe Viet Minh was a unification of all of the communist parties in Saigon that were kicked out after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. In what way is this disguising communism? It was openly lead by Ho Chi Minh, who was openly communist. \n\nAlso I would like to just take the time and ridicule everyone in that thread that said Vietnam wasn't about communism, but \\*insert communist country here*. That means it was about communism, genius.\n ",

        "author": "[deleted]",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2os5m8/guardian_published_pulitzer_award_winning_article/",
        "text": "http://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/dec/09/-sp-myth-of-the-good-war?CMP=fb_gu\nWhile I agree there is a sense of futility whenever discussing the First World War, World War 2 was entirely different. World War One was, as it's sometimes refered to, as a Royal Family Fued. The deadlock trench warfare and the hundreds of thousands who died for miles is a contentious issue to this day. The blatant aggression of the Axis, their atrocities and the aims of the Allies in the Second World War make it as good of a war as you can get.\n\n&gt;The myth of the Bad War and the Good War has become very dangerous, insofar as it has conditioned our attitude to war as a whole. The notion that the second world war was finer and nobler than the first is highly dubious in itself, since it sanitises so much, from the slaughter of civilians by Allied bombing to the gang rape of millions of women by our Russian allies at the moment of victory.\n\nWe get the impression that the author is attempting to level guilt to the Allies by comparing strategic bombing to it to the crimes of the Axis. If we look at the statistics of those killed by Allied strategic bombing and compare it to the total number of people killed during the war - no - to the number of people killed during the Holocaust and in Japanese atrocities, they pale in comparisson. I cannot fathom how people can compare them. About [353,000] (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/books/review/the-bombers-and-the-bombed-by-richard-overy.html?_r=0) German civilians and about [337,000] (http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP13.HTM) Japanese civilians were killed by air raids. Comparing this to the 11 million killed during the Holocaust and the 3 to 10 million killed by the Japanese seems ludicrous. Not only that, the author neglects the circumstances in which strategic bombing was employed. The contexts are entirely different. Strategic bombing was genuinely percieved to be a quick and efficient way to end the war with minimal loss of life. Can we really say the same about the Holocaust?\n\nThe gang rape of women by the Red Army has been documented. It's true it was a horrific event and no historian, or even a sane person, can defend. For some reason or another, one of the few valid arguments which the author introduces only brings it up once. An article about Allied war crimes and arguably the most awful war crime an Allied country carried out is mentioned once. Strange.\n\n\nWe then get to the Pacific War.\n\n&gt;As Macdonald said, even critics like himself recognised that in Europe “fascism was the most terrible enemy. But the war in the Pacific is a straight imperialist conflict of the classic old pattern”. The Japanese had no right to be in the Philippines or Malaya or Java. But what right did the Americans or British or Dutch? More than that, the Americans were inflamed by a racial hatred of the Japanese. This was given bizarre voice by Paul McNutt, President Roosevelt’s manpower commissioner, who advocated “the extermination of the Japanese in toto”, and practical expression by the obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nAs you'll know, Japan had invaded China in 1931 and had turned it into a full out war in 1937. Throughout the 1937-45 war, Japan committed huge scale atrocities. When Japan eventually attacked the West, she again, continued carrying out henious atrocities against Western PoWs and civilians, as well as most proportionatly Asian civilians. While it can be argued this was a war of empires (and likely factually correct), can we really compare Japanese atrocities to that of the US, the Dutch or British empires? When did the US systematically [vivisect and test the effects of the bubonic plague and anthrax] (http://www.japanfocus.org/-Tsuneishi-Keiichi/2194) on Filipinos? When did the Dutch [coerce Indonesian women into prostitution] (http://www.jpri.org/publications/workingpapers/wp77.html)? When did the British [massacre entire cities] (https://sites.google.com/a/wellesley.edu/china-politics-links/a-japanese-perspective)? With regard to conduct in the war, moral equivalencies hold no water.\n\nWhile racism was a factor in the Pacific War - as illustrated in this great book - it had nothing to do with the decision to drop the atomic bombs. The only reason the atomic bombs were not dropped on Germany is because she had surrendered. Japan refused to do so. I can accept what influence the atomic bombs had on Japan's decision to surrender is debated, nonetheless their use was borne out of legitimate fear that a land invasion would be disastrous *for both sides*. Japan several weeks prior to the bombings conscripted every boy over 16 and and girl over 14 into militias. They had doubled the garrison in Kyushu Island. There was no reason to suggest Japan was preparing to surrender. Even so it's now known that it's likely Japan would have [killed all their prisoners] (http://www.mansell.com/pow_resources/Formosa/taiwandocs.html) and possible she would have employed biological and chemcial weapons had an invasion taken place.\n\nI spat my tea out at this part:\n\n&gt;As only a few critics noted at the time of its release in 1993, Schindler’s List presents a version of the second world war that is historically and ethically misleading. “Only Steve could make a movie about the Holocaust in which no Jews are killed,” Stanley Kubrick said. Jason Epstein, writing in the New York Review of Books, showed how questionable it was to make a hero out of a figure as ambiguous as Oskar Schindler, and to tell a heartwarming story of a few thousand saved rather than the millions murdered.\n\nThis is not related to Badhistory as such, but dearie me. Schindler's List isn't spared either. No Jews killed!? [The streets of the Warsaw ghetto are littered with Jewish dead at one point!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHsGuAGsLm8) [Commandant Amon Goeth murders people from his balcony!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG35CXU8PGo) Have they not watched the bloody film!? I just, what?\n\n&gt;So there are, if not perhaps the reflections he intends. Great Britain did not, of course, go to war in 1939 to save the Jews from persecution, and if that had been the purpose, we would not have succeeded.\n\nThis is elementary level knowledge, considering the Holocaust began in 1941. Britain went to war to protect Poland's independence from German aggression. I don't even know why this is included in the article. I don't think many people genuinely believe Britain declared war on Germany to stop the Holocaust. A bit anecdotal, but in primary school I was taught the Holocaust. Not once did the teacher claim Britain went to war to stop it. \n\n&gt;What, above all, characterised the 1939-45 war was the fact that so many more civilians than soldiers were killed, something that should have a special resonance in Britain – because the most distinctive British contribution to the war was the bombing that destroyed the cities of Germany and killed hundreds of thousands, mostly women and children. By some counts, those civilians outnumbered the British servicemen who died.\n\nAs with not watching Schindler's List, it's as if the author doesn't know what Total War is. Total War was adopted by all sides. Strategic bombing was adopted by all sides. I should also point out strategic bombing was, at the time, extremelly vague. Total war gave it the interpretation that it could be legal. By making most of the working men and women directly part of the war effort, their communities and cities were militarized. No German or Japanese soldier was convicted of bombing civilians for this reason (and as it would have raised uncomfortable question regarding Allied bombing).\n\nThis article plays on common misconceptions about the wars and exaggerates them to all new levels. The part about Schindler's List, I just can't.",

        "text": "[Putin said a thing](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30340722). It was a very silly thing to say, and a lot of people are very confused by it. What was it? In Putin's annual address to Parliament, he justified the annexation of Crimea by claiming that, in addition to being an \"internal dispute,\" Crimea is the Russian equivalent of the Temple Mount, at least in terms of its spiritual significance. He went on to clarify the statement, saying that:\n\n&gt; For our country, for our people, this event has a special meaning, because our people live in Crimea and the territory itself is strategically important. It was here in Crimea in ancient Khersones, or Korsun as the chroniclers called it, that Count Vladimir was baptised (in the 10th century), to then baptise the rest of Rus.\n\nThis is an interesting interpretation of history. While we don't know the exact history of the Christianisation of the Rus, we do know some of it. For instance, Patriarch Photius mentions the conversion of Bulgaria in 863 and the subsequent conversion of the Rus in an encyclical dated to 867. A bishop was even sent to the area from Constantinople, though the conversions didn't stick too terribly well. \n\nThe event that's generally considered the beginning of Russian Christianity is the conversion of Vladimir the Great, the Grand Prince of Kiev, in 988. This is another event that's fraught with legend, but I'll do my best to get through it. Vladimir took the Kieven throne in 980 and promptly began a reign that lavished praises on Slavic pagan gods. He held sacrifices, built temples, and did all the things good pagan kings are supposed to do. However, he was also the ruler of a city at a confluence of religions at a time of religious turmoil. He was surrounded by Christians, Jews, and Muslims, each of whom sought leverage in the wealth of Kiev. He faced both internal pressure and external pressure, and in response tried to reform Slavic paganism. This, however, failed, and pressure and instability continued to mount. \n\nThere are two versions of Vladimir's conversion, one based on the [Primary Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Chronicle) (which was written in 1113), and one based on Islamic and Arab sources. According to the Primary Chronicle, in 987, Vladimir sent emissaries to neighbouring religions as well as accepting missionaries from these and other faiths. There are various (apocryphal) reasons that Vladimir rejected these faiths. In the case of Judaism, for instance, he saw the Jews' statelessness as evidence that God had rejected them. He didn't like Catholic churches, and he wasn't a fan of the Islamic prohibition on alcohol. However, he was so impressed with Byzantine architecture and churches that he was convinced that Orthodox Christianity was probably the way to go. After marrying Princess Anna of Byzantium, Vladimir converted to Christianity and began the process of converted the rest of Kiev. Arab sources, however, disagree, saying that, rather than having emissaries and a religious experience, Vladimir agreed to convert to Christianity in exchange for marrying Princess Anna and helping the Byzantine Emperor Basil II with a revolt in 987. This, in turn, began the process of the Christianisation of the Rus. \n\nThe conversion of Vladimir the Great is undoubtedly a key event in Russian and Ukrainian history, and especially in the history of the religions of both countries. There is decidedly more to this history than Putin gives it credit for, though. For instance, remember when I said that Vladimir was the grand prince of Kiev? The history of Russia, like the history of many countries, is not the history of one unified people, but rather the history of many different groups and political entities all coming together. \"Russia\" didn't exist as a thing in the 10th century. There were the Rus, yes, but Rus divided into many different groups. This doesn't change, however, that Kiev is in Ukraine, not Russia, and that if Vladimir is going to be assigned a modern nationality - which I'm really, really not doing - he would be Ukrainian, not Russian. \n\nEven beyond the idea of Vladimir not being part of the right group of Rus, where Vladimir was actually baptised is another point of debate with Chersonesus not necessarily being the most likely candidate. It's more likely that he was baptised in Vasilev or Kiev itself rather than wandering the whole way out to Crimea. Kiev remains a more important pilgrimage destination in Russian Orthodoxy than Crimea, meaning that if Putin were going to be making geopolitical claims about what is and is not Russia based on religious importance, then he's essentially claiming that all of Ukraine is secretly Russia. \n\nVladimir the Great was an important figure in the founding of Russian Christianity; there's no doubt about that. What is doubtful, though, is that his actions took place in Crimea, or that he can be adopted as a Russian historical figure whose actions justify modern political manoeuvrings. He was Kievan, not Russian and not Ukrainian, and Russian Christianity probably wasn't founded in Ukraine.",

They lacked discipline. Iron discipline--imposed by relentless drill and a chain of command able to impose punishment to squash any disobedience--is the single unalternable requirement of quality heavy line infantry. It existed only in the [American] West and then only at certain times and places, and was a product of that supression of individual license that this foolish author mistakes for authoritarianism. Even the Scots found that to stiffen the schiltrons against English cavalry required their nobility to dismount and form the front line, providing the leadership and incidentally the armored men necessary to absorb the initial charge. License is not liberty, and indiscipline and license are what caused the native cultures of America to lose what liberty they had. Phalanx or shield-wall are both valid options to stop shock cavalry in their tracks, but without unit cohesion, defined chains of command, and regular drill, you just have a mass of guys with spears. I endorse your comments on the Aztecs [that crushing the Aztecs was the best thing the conquistadors did]. Mourning the Aztecs is like mourning the smallpox vaccine. The Incas weren't much better, and IIRC the mound-builder cultures had rigidly stratified caste distinctions that would make the Hindus look socially mobile.\"\n\nI'm **assuming** he means the American West, not Europe, when he says \"West\", because if he really thinks Europeans were the only people to invent military discipline, I just.....\n\n&gt; What he's also missing is the simple fact that while North and South America produced warriors who used spears, none of those could have ever, even theoretically stood up to Spanish cavalry, or even a dozen pissed off guys on scrubby little ponies. They lacked discipline. Iron discipline--imposed by relentless drill and a chain of command able to impose punishment to squash any disobedience--is the single unalternable requirement of quality heavy line infantry. It existed only in the West and then only at certain times and places.  Even the Scots found that to stiffen the schiltrons against English cavalry required their nobility to dismount and form the front line, providing the leadership and incidentally the armored men necessary to absorb the initial charge.\n\nThis is wrong in so many levels. Quizo Yupanqui's Inca men, **all infantry**, killed thousands of soldiers, including dozens of mounted Spaniards, during the Siege of Lima in 1536. So the Inca did in fact produce infantry that could, and did, defeat Spanish cavalry. Same for the Tlaxcalans, Aztecs, and other Mesoamerican peoples; the Aztecs even had military courts. Really, how does this guy think the Incas and Aztecs made their empires, if their infantry (and pre-Coulmbian armies were **only infantry**) were so undisciplined that they couldn't stand up to twelve Spaniards on little ponies? And the Mapuche, who should have according to this guy been conquered in an hour by the Spanish, repulsed the Spaniards for *330 years*. The Maya, too, lasted nearly 200 years. The Miskito defeated the Spanish for 200 years (though the Miskito were significantly aided by the British and joined by large numbers of maroons, so perhaps it's not very fair). And so on and on and on.\n \nFurthermore, 19th-century Plains society was generally more undisciplined than Inca society or Aztec society. Mo'ohtavetoo'o (Black Kettle) had no real justification to stop his warriors from fighting the Americans; Atawalpa, or Motecuhzoma, did (and in fact, Motecuhzoma's authority was enough to keep Tenochtitlan from rebelling prior to the massacre in May 1520, something that Mo'ohtavetoo'o never managed to do). In 1876, Maȟpíya Lúta (Red Cloud) had no power over Tašúŋke Witkó (Crazy Horse) or other Oglaga warriors. In the 1880s, Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake (Sitting Bull) could only watch his warriors desert; I doubt that Manqu Inka Yupanki (Manco Inca Yupanqui) would have done the same.\n\nAlso, I fail to see what makes Scots more undisciplined than other people, as the poster implies here.\n\n&gt; License is not liberty, and indiscipline and license are what caused the native cultures of America to lose what liberty they had. Phalanx or shield-wall are both valid options to stop shock cavalry in their tracks, but without unit cohesion, defined chains of command, and regular drill, you just have a mass of guys with spears. \n\nThe Inca may not have used phalanxes or shield walls, which are, as I understand it, more or less useless tactics in steep landscapes like the Andes, but as Mann says in 1491 (a book this guy claims to have read) they had good anti-cavalry technics that used the mountainous landscape to their advantage, like attacking the Spaniards on Inca roads, or using slings. The existence of victories by native infantry against Spanish cavalry shows that they did in fact have some sort of anti-cavalry tactics.\n\n&gt; I endorse your comments on the Aztecs [that crushing the Aztecs was the best thing the conquistadors did]. Mourning the Aztecs is like mourning the smallpox vaccine. The Incas weren't much better, and IIRC the mound-builder cultures had rigidly stratified caste distinctions that would make the Hindus look socially mobile.\n\nI assume he meant to say \"smallpox\" not \"smallpox vaccine.\"\n\nSmallpox killed billions of people. I doubt the Aztecs ever killed more than 2 million in their wars against their neighbors, and the Incas probably killed far less, since Inca religion was much less focused on human sacrifice. And the destruction of Mesoamerican and Andean science, philosophy, culture, and civilization is uncomparable to a campaign against lethal and horrible disease transmitted by an arguably non-living being. And let's not argue that the Conquests were a noble campaign by the valiant Spaniards to end dark and evil human sacrifice rituals. \n\nAs for Mississippian society, yes, Natchez society (the only Mississippian culture that survived into the 18th century) was stratified into Nobles and Stinkards. Was it really any worse than the social structure of their French conquerors at the time? And does the stratification of Natchez society justify the French actions towards them?",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2omnd5/lincoln_apparently_wanted_to_see_his_wife_and/",
        "text": "I got bored tonight and wanted to find something interesting to submit here, so naturally I started reading the one-star reviews of Doris Kearns Goodwin's book—a place bound to contain very interesting viewpoints. It wasn't long before I stumbled upon a very silly comment, amid an ocean of otherwise bad information on Lincoln and the Civil War as well as bad criticisms of the book. (Apparently her book sucked because she didn't write enough about things that lay outside the project of her work.) It reads:\n\n&gt;There was no \"Civil War\" when Honest Abe rode on a train with his wife and children on his way to Washington to be inaugurated. During that ride his security man (Pinkerton, BTW) believed that the train would be attacked, or that an attempt would be made on Lincoln's life while switching trains in Baltimore, and he so informed Lincoln. Lincoln reasonably got off the train in disguise and took a different train to DC. The only problem was that he left his family to ride on the train he believed would be attacked. This incident is known as the \"Baltimore Plot.\" You won't find anything about it in most Lincoln biographies, unless they're biographies of Mary Todd Lincoln. Open you eyes and ask yourself why this is. (FTR, I've never lived south of northern NJ, but along the way I learned that all I learned in HS wasn't all there was to learn about Honest Abe.)\n\nNow, this would be pretty damning if there were any reason to believe that the comment is anything other than stupid. First off, the comment makes it sound like Lincoln knowingly left his family to ride on a train that was going to be ambushed by armed conspirators, essentially leaving them for dead. Obviously this isn't true, as simple common sense would tell us.\n\nIn reality, the plot that Pinkerton believed to be in place was that armed assassins scattered throughout the crowd at the President Street station in Baltimore, where Lincoln would exit the train to board another into Washington. The idea was that, as Lincoln made his way through a crowd that would gather to see him, at least one conspiracy would be within reach of him and thereby be able to stab him and fulfill the objective. Pinkerton did not expect that the train itself would be attacked, as this person is suggesting. Lincoln did, as this person notes, take a different train. But into Baltimore, not D.C., in respect to foiling this plot. He was escorted from Harrisburg into Baltimore via rail overnight, which still presented a danger in that Baltimore prohibited nighttime locomotive transport in the city, requiring that carriages be horse-drawn between the President and Camden Street stations. He did, however, arrive safely (as anyone here could've guessed), before being taken from Baltimore to Washington. His family was transported on the scheduled train, but still for fear of the plot that was still believed to be in place, they exited the train several blocks shy of the President Street station, thereby keeping them out of harms way. Upon arrival of his carriage, it was announced that the president-elect had already passed through.\n\nSo why don't Lincoln biographers portray him as a narcissistic coward who abandoned his family in expectation that they'd be killed by assassins targeting him? Because that just isn't what happened. As for this information being kept out of public view for whatever reason, as the commenter suggests, it's readily available information that even [has its own goddamn wikipedia page.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Plot) And I've read at least several biographies that do mention the circumstances of Lincoln's arrival in Washington via Baltimore. It's a pretty well-known story, sans false accusations of Lincoln trying to get his family murdered.",

Where and when? Assuming that the where is the Northeastern United States, this simply isn't true, even if it's the version mentioned in follow-up comments which has been described as simply ground up everything.\n\nTo quote from historian J.L. Bell's wonderful blog [Boston 1775](http://boston1775.blogspot.com/2010/05/lobster-legend.html) (If y'all have any interest in colonial America or the Revolutionary War you should be reading his blog):\n\n&gt;In fact, all the statements I found on Google Books about colonial American workers complaining about too much lobster date from the last quarter-century. Antiquarians of earlier decades would have loved to put that factoid into print if they’d come across evidence for it, and they didn’t.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, none of these books and none of the websites that make similar statements cites a verifiable historical source.\n\nJ.L. Bell does a similar exercise for England in a story about [salmon](http://boston1775.blogspot.com/2010/05/fishy-tale-about-salmon.html) where there's a myth about how servants requested they not be served salmon. \n\n[Relevant XKCD](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/citogenesis.png)\n\n&gt;[Aluminum.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2olntx/what_is_now_considered_a_sign_of_wealth_that_was/cmoc77f)\n\n&gt; When it was first isolated it was super rare and worth more than gold. Countries would store bars of aluminum next to their crown jewels/silver/gold. Some rich people had their finest silverware made out of it\n\nTrue enough, aluminum was worth more than gold when it was first discovered. However countries would not display it next to their crown jewels. France did this at the L'Exposition Universelle in 1855 which was dedicated to aluminum. If by some rich people they mean Napoleon III, they'd be correct. Aluminum did become a fad as an accessory in France, which strove to become the leading light in Europe. Buttons were made of it as were opera glasses, even prayer book covers. By the late 19th century (before 1890 anything that could be made of silver could be made of platinum). \n\n\n&gt;The colour of your teeth.\n\n&gt;Up until the early 19th century in Britain, black and decaying teeth were a sign of wealth, as only the richest could afford to buy sugar cane and confectionery.\n\n&gt;It was only when the taxes on sugar were removed in the 1830s that it became more common, and the trend died out in the upper classes.\n\nThis part is particularly awful. Decaying teeth were never a sign of wealth. While wealthy people did tend to have poorer teeth thanks to higher calories, that didn't mean poor teeth were fashionable. The word teethbrush was coined in 1650 for example, and we have records of healthcare products for tooth care being sold even earlier than that. I'm also not sure what they're referring to here with the idea that Britain repealed taxes on sugar in the 1830s. The Sugar Act of 1764 was repealed in 1766 and replaced with the Revenue Act of 1766, which was replaced with the Revenue Act of 1767, which wasn't repealed until 1867. ",

        "text": "[Wow.](http://www.koreansentry.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=3128)\n\n\n&gt;OP of this thread: \"It appears in Chinese historical records that Baekje (an ancient Korean kingdom, heavily influenced by Chinese civilization) in fact did conquer and run directly colonial settlements around the Liaoxi and Shandong regions.\"\n\nLeaving aside what a \"colonial settlement\" even means in the 3rd century, there is literally no evidence whatsoever of Korean rule over eastern China. Since this \"colonization\" apparently happened around 350, this means that *the fucking capital *(modern Nanjing)* of the Eastern Jin Dynasty* was under Korean rule. Where the Eastern Jin Emperors actually ruled from if Jiankang, its capital, was under Baekje rule is unexplained. Furthermore, as I will continue to mention, this means a large number of the Sixteen Kingdoms, *non-Chinese kingdoms ruling over large parts of China*, did not exist. Why Sinocentric scholars would fabricate non-Chinese kingdoms in China is unexplained.\n\n\nJust look at the map at the bottom of Post #1 of the thread. These group of Korean nationalists are saying that the (heavily sinicized) Korean kingdom of Baekje (18 BCE-660 CE), which was [actually this size](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/History_of_Korea-375.png) at its zenith, had \"colonial settlements\" over the entire coast of China from Shanghai to Liaodong (Inner Mongolia appears to be yet another \"Baekje colonial settlement\"). Oh, and apparently 70% of Japan was a Baekje \"colonial settlement\" as well. \n\nIf that much land was under Korean rule, that means that Northern Yan and Southern Yan kingdoms did not, in fact, even exist, because the entire territories of those two kingdoms are a part of what this map indicates as Baekje territory. As said, why Chinese historians would fabricate two non-Chinese kingdoms is unexplained. Furthermore, the *Samguk Sagi*, the earliest and most reliable primary source for Korean history, records that in a Chinese invasion of Baekje, the Chinese had to *cross the sea.* If Baekje ruled the entire Chinese coastline, how did the Chinese even have a navy?\n\n\nThere's an even more ridiculous map, in page 7 of the same thread. In that map, we learn that Baekje also had \"colonial settlements\" in Taiwan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and even Sumatra, Java and Borneo. \n\nThere is no archaeological or historical evidence at all of Korean rule, or even Korean traders, in any of these places at the time. If Baekje ruled over Taiwan, the Baekjeans were all invisible, because there are no Korean influences whatsoever in Taiwanese aboriginal culture. Same with every other place in that list. Furthermore, the *Samguk Sagi* does not mention any Southeast Asians. So either ancient Southeast Asians were all invisible, or the map is BS.\n\n\nAnother map in page 9 indicates that Baekje apparently had \"colonial settlements\" as far inland as *Shanxi* and *Henan*. \n\nAgain, This means that half of the Sixteen Kingdoms in Chinese history did not exist. Why Sinocentric Chinese scholars would fabricate half a dozen non-Chinese kingdoms is unexplained. Also, again, where did the Eastern Jin emperors rule from if Korea ruled Jiankang? Furthermore, *how is there no archaeological evidence at all of this?* And how did Chinese scholars write so little about a kingdom that ruled 60% of China, while they wrote that much about non-Chinese peoples that ruled over 10% of China?\n\n\nOh, and more posts from this thread: \n\n&gt;Post #2 of page 1: \"Of course this is never taught in high schools on both sides of the Yellow Sea to maintain 'peaceful diplomatic relations'.\"\n\nIt's not taught in high schools because it's *false*. Korean textbooks happily detail the wars between Koreans and China. Oh, and as Japanese are portrayed as almost demonic in most Korean textbooks about the 20th century, the Korean Ministry of Education probably doesn't care much about what its neighbors think about its textbooks.\n\n&gt;Post #4 of page 1: \"Well [the Chinese] vehemently deny it and as usual they block all archaeological sites to Koreans because they're afraid of actually discovering vast swathes of their land and people were subservient to the Baekje warrior elite.\"\n\nThe Chinese allow South Koreans to do research. They even allow *North Korean* archaeologists to do research, and North Koreans are much more nationalistic than South Koreans. Besides, if this guy is right, why isn't the PRC destroying every single mention of the Yuan Dynasty, since they should be afraid that \" vast swathes of their land and people were subservient to the Mongolian warrior elite?\"\n\n&gt;Post #2 of page 4: \"We know [Confucius] wasn't Chinese for sure since there was no Chinese living at that period in Lu state.\n\nBy the time of Confucius, all of the Shandong Peninsula was Chinese; the Qi Kingdom, founded in previously non-Sinitic lands, was certainly Chinese by the time of Confucius. And 500 years before Confucius, the Lu State was *still* largely Chinese; one of the most important functions of the Lu State in the early Zhou Dynasty was protection against the eastern non-Chinese (Dongyi) peoples.\n\n&gt;Post #4 of page 7: \"I guess we can only wait till [the Chinese] disintegrate to know the TRUTH.\"\n\nHow can an ethnic group disintegrate?\n\n&gt;Last post of page 8: \"Looks like Japanese or Taiwanese editors on Wikipedia found Baekje's relations with China too much to handle. I mean I didn't personally edit any Wikipedia articles, someone else who clearly wants to reveal the truth of numerous irrefutable textual evidence from Chinese, Jurchen, Khitan, Korean and Manchu sources added it yet it was minimized by perhaps the same irrational keyboard warriors who found it unbearable. Quoting actual textual evidence directly, how is that ultranationalism seriously?\"\n\nNote: Actually, WP does not mention Baekje conquering China because it never happened. There is no Jurchen, Khitan, Korean or Manchu sources that say Baekje invaded China, and the few Chinese sources that may say so are probably being misinterpreted or are just records of naval raids and such. Furthermore, the people on WP who wrote the Baekje article are mostly Koreans.\n\n&gt;Last post of page 9: \" Basically speaking real Japonic or Jomon [was destroyed] by Baekje.\"\n\nNote:The Jomon Culture was destroyed by Yayoi people centuries before Baekje existed. Also, since the modern Japanese speak a Japonic language, they are Japonic. This statement is equivalent to saying that modern Turks aren't \"real Turkish people\" because the Hittites were the only real Turks.\n\n&gt;I have no idea what the first post of page 11 is supposed to mean: \"There's still hopes for SE Asian history because they don't have neighbors like Japan or China claiming everything. Afterall, SE Asians are more gentle but there's issue with Thailand, this is one country that I can not trust from SE Asia.\"\n\nNote: Why this *moderator* is so biased against Thais, I will never know. Thailand is not any more \"untrustworthy\" than China or Korea or Vietnam or Japan or France. I just don't know why this guy hates Thailand.",

        "text": "I came across [this post](http://np.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/2nvb5f/do_south_koreans_ever_get_frustrated_at/cmhfck1) and [this post](http://np.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/2nw1es/have_the_koreans_ever_been_important_or_excelled/) in /r/Korea. They're pretty terrible, and there's many different elements of bad history in them (among other bad elements). I think the question they raise, though, is not necessarily just the history of Korea. I don't really want to do a post on the full history of Korea, detailing Korean accomplishments and innovations. I don't even think that's the most dangerous and offensive part of these posts. What I think is more problematic is the idea that there is \"history worth knowing\" and \"history worth knowing.\" It's reflected in responses like [this one](http://np.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/2nvb5f/do_south_koreans_ever_get_frustrated_at/cmhfrcl) that point out something that Korea did that had an international impact. There's nothing wrong with that response to the question if you're approaching the question on a \"What did Korea do\" basis. There is something wrong if you're approaching the question of \"What is there to know about Korea, and why should I care.\"\n\nApologies once again for going all philosophical. Someday, I will return to my beloved food history.\n\nI love to learn about the history of obscure things. The history of chairs, the history of food, the history of that rock over there in the corner that really hasn't accomplished much of note in all its billions of years of existence. To me, this is what's interesting. It's not wars or politics or massively international history, but it's interesting. Why is it interesting? It's interesting because we learn about who we are and where we've been. Knowing these things is no more or less valuable than knowing about the Treaty of Versailles or the Magna Carta. It's the history of ordinary people and of identity.\n\nSo how does this relate to the question of Korean history? The posts I linked have an underlying assumption, namely that something has to have a large impact to be worthy of being called \"history\" (or at least be worth studying). Essentially, it's saying that some aspects of the past matter more than others, or that some thing are \"worth knowing\" and others are useless. Even going beyond the idea that the poster is disregarding an entire culture's past and heritage, this idea of some things being useless to know is ridiculous. Understanding ideas and where they come from, regardless of how non-immediately relevant they might seem, is a valuable endeavour, if not for itself, then for the fact that it, once again, can show a bit about who we are.\n\nBut let's look at this a different way. Suppose the poster was right, and there is such a thing as knowledge worth having and knowledge not worth having. How do we decide what's what? I'll agree that from certain perspectives, there is some knowledge that is more immediately useful than others. For instance, if I'm travelling to Turkmenistan, it might be more helpful to read about the history of Turkmenistan than, say, Burkina Faso. The history of Burkina Faso is not immediately relevant to what I want and need to know. Equally, if I'm taking a test on American history, then it's more useful to study American history than it is to study Korean history. Does this mean that Korean or Burkinabe history is not worth knowing, though? Not at all. If nothing else, shared experiences can teach us something, and certainly knowledge is something worth having.\n\nEven more than immediate relevance, though, is the fact that history changes. Take the history of Native America or pre-colonial Africa. Part of the reason we're only starting to discover so much about the history of these places is because the interest in them is more recent. Certainly the act of teaching this history as part of a standardised curriculum is relatively recent, especially when compared to the history of Europe. Even within European history, what we choose to study has shifted to include more and more of previously marginalised voices, such as the voices of the peasantry, women, and ethnic minorities. By including these perspectives, we gain a much broader understanding of these places and the history around them. Have we always deemed them \"worth studying?\" Nope, but happily, ideas change, and this idea that there is history \"worth knowing\" and history not \"worth knowing\" is not terribly solid. We recognise that we need this broad understanding of history in order to actually know history. \n\nMy own beloved history-of-random-household-objects-and-food is a product of this expansion into unknown histories, and I am eternally grateful for the innumerable historians who decided that these were histories \"worth knowing.\" After all, as much as things like the fall of Rome or the invention of Hangul have effects, the invention of ice cream or the popularisation of pizza also had an effect on the average person, one which shouldn't be downplayed or ignored.\n\nMy point, then, is simply this: what we consider \"history\" shouldn't be divided into what is \"worth knowing\" and what is not \"worth knowing.\" There is no such divide, nor should there be. There is history that is more relevant at certain times than others, sure, but this doesn't mean that some history shouldn't be studied or isn't worth the time. It's all the story of us, and it's all part of our past, whether it had a massive international and historical impact or not.\n\nAnd Korea totally has history. Just saying.\n\nEDIT: [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2odkhm/who_decides_what_history_is_worth_knowing/cmm9eh8?context=3) comment by /u/_winterlight is fantastic, and I think does a good job saying what should be said.",

        "text": "After hearing a speech by Carly Fiorina that mentioned the achievements of the Arab Muslims in a speech called Technology, Business and Our way of Life: What's Next, an Assyrian Nationalist named Peter BetBasoo submitted the following letter entitled \"[What Arab Civilization?](http://www.ninevehsoft.com/fiorina.htm)\" The text in its entirety is too long to reproduce here entirety, but the following quote should suffice to capture the sheer crazy that he put down:\n\n&gt;You state, \"its mathematicians created the algebra and algorithms that would enable the building of computers, and the creation of encryption.\" The fundamental basis of modern mathematics had been laid down not hundreds but thousands of years before by Assyrians and Babylonians, who already knew of the concept of zero, of the Pythagorean Theorem, and of many, many other developments expropriated by Arabs/Muslims (see History of Babylonian Mathematics, Neugebauer). \n\n&gt;Arabs/Muslims are engaged in an explicit campaign of destruction and expropriation of cultures and communities, identities and ideas. Wherever Arab/Muslim civilization encounters a non-Arab/Muslim one, it attempts to destroy it (as the Buddhist statues in Afghanistan were destroyed, as Persepolis was destroyed by the Ayotollah Khomeini). This is a pattern that has been recurring since the advent of Islam, 1400 years ago, and is amply substantiated by the historical record. If the \"foreign\" culture cannot be destroyed, then it is expropriated, and revisionist historians claim that it is and was Arab, as is the case of most of the Arab \"accomplishments\" you cited in your speech. For example, Arab history texts in the Middle East teach that Assyrians were Arabs, a fact that no reputable scholar would assert, and that no living Assyrian would accept. Assyrians first settled Nineveh, one of the major Assyrian cities, in 5000 B.C., which is 5630 years before Arabs came into that area. Even the word 'Arab' is an Assyrian word, meaning \"Westerner\" (the first written reference to Arabs was by the Assyrian King Sennacherib, 800 B.C., in which he tells of conquering the \"ma'rabayeh\" -- Westerners. See The Might That Was Assyria, by H. W. F. Saggs). \n\nOf course, the presence of figures like al-Kindi, who paved the way for modern pharmacology, al-Razi, who worked in the first modern laboratories, al-Jazari, who built some of the first robots in the world, and Harun al-Rashid, who built the colossal House of Wisdom so that a huge amount of scholars and researchers can continue learning and discussing these scientific works, all of whom were Arab Muslims that extensively contributed to modern science and technology blow BetBasoo's arguments out of the water. To claim that the Arabs contributed nothing to civilisation and just stole from the Greeks and Assyrians is as insane as claiming that Western Civilization is a lie created by the Germanic barbarians that stole everything from the Greeks and Romans, or indeed, how the Assyrian barbarians stole everything from Babylon and Sumeria [and built stelae commemorating how they ransacked entire cities](http://www.ancient.eu/Ashurbanipal/).",

        "text": "_The Kid Who Couldn't Miss_, Paul Cowan's 1982 production about Billy Bishop, Canada's leading First World War fighter ace, begins with the following disclaimer.\n\n&gt; This film is a docu-drama and combines elements of both reality and fiction. It does not pretend to be a biography of Billy Bishop. Certain characters have been used to express certain doubts and reservations about Bishop's exploits. There is no evidence that these were shared by the actual characters.\n\nIf you're like me, this will say \"what follows is even more a pack of lies than your average documentary.\" This film is going to try to have its cake and eat it too (how weaselly \"docu-drama\" and \"both reality and fiction\" are!). It warns you to be on your guard: cheap tricks ahead. Yet this disclaimer is a later addition. _The Kid Who Couldn't Miss_ is a unique thing: a film with history so outrageous it was brought before the Senate of Canada. With the film paid for by the taxpayer and presented as a \"feature-length documentary\" by the government-funded National Film Board, the Senate insisted on this warning (actually, a more specific disclaimer was suggested^[1] but rejected by Cowan) so the unwary public would be fooled no longer.\n\nThe film is played as a straight documentary incorporating segments from a separate play. There is significant use of archive footage, interviews with surviving veterans, family members, and one historian, reconstructions. If you didn't know better, you'd say this was meant to be an honest portrayal, done in a modern style alongside a distinct, fictional portrayal. (A fictional portrayal that, incidentally, is much less objectionable than the \"docu\" part!)\n\nIf we'd had /r/badhistory in 1982, Paul Cowan might have displaced volcanos as our patron diety. Not just because the history was so bad it became a matter of governmental concern, but because the influence of that bad history can be felt even today.\n\nThe documentary... I beg your pardon, docu-drama... begins by establishing a young Bishop as a gun-firing skirt-chasing lazy student who, as a high schooler, \"[broadens] his horizons to fist-fighting and hell-raising. In desperation, his father packs him off to the Royal Military College [. . .] where Bishop's lack of academic inclination will pass unnoticed.\" From the start Cowan is wearing his opinions on his sleeve, but we're actually not in bad shape here history-wise. The young Bishop _was_ an indifferent student, and both he and his son were deprecating about his early years of school and military training. But he was no ruffian or academic disaster^[2] and the snide tone is uncalled for: compare the Cowan-penned narration to the play's portrayal of Bishop, not written by Cowan, and see what I mean^[3].\n\nThe first bit of ironclad badhistory comes courtesy our narrator who, as Bishop is training at the RMC in the spring of 1914, says \"Canada has always been a peaceful nation.\" This is a popular bit of mythmaking from the era, regurgitated as fact. Even omitting our colonial history, in the spring of 1914 Canada was only 46 years old but had already fought in: the two Riel rebellions of 1870 and 1885, the second Boer War, Garnet Wolseley's relief of Charles Gordon, and the Fenian raids. The most important centre of many communities, next to the church, was the militia hall. \"Always been peaceful?\" My eye! One senses an attempt to transpose the Trudeau-era idyll of Canada as a land of \"honest brokers\" and peacemakers to an era when it unconditionally does not belong. Later on, they accompany footage and photos of hideous casualties with a song that goes \"_nobody shoots no-one in Canada..._\" Just in case you missed it.\n\nThis fanciful flight leads into the shocking relevation that Bishop has \"cheated on his final exams, and is to be expelled.\" Shock and horror! And a quarter-truth at best. Bishop did cheat at the RMC, but in first year, 1911-12, when his studies were going badly. There was never any threat of expulsion: Bishop was \"rusticated\", RMC jargon for being set back a year^[4]. Saying it was his final year, on the eve of European war, and threatening him with explusion, is senseless: even an insufficiently unflattering truth apparently needs zesting up. \n\nThis is followed by a segment of Standard Nobody-Wanted-This-Senseless-War Boilerplate according to ISO 1914, because Prussian imperialism, pan-Slavism, and Austro-Hungarian interests in Serbia don't real. You're familiar with this sort of thing so I'll pass it over, save to observe that the narrator implies it's been _three hundred years_ of peace in Europe. Apparently the French Revolution, two Napoleons, the Crimea, and God alone knows what else have been flushed down the memory hole. \"Nobody knows what war is like,\" we're told; Canada's own Minister of Militia served in the Boer, and the commander of Bishop's Canadian Corps had done battle all over Africa for decades.\n\nBishop goes off to commence \"serious training\", says the narrator stolidly while the film shows a bunch of soldiers roughhousing and playing around. More fair play.\n\nThere is some general oh-boy-isn't-war-miserable stuff, lions-led-by-donkeys, you know the drill. Billy Bishop gets sick of the trenches and joins No. 21 Squadron= Royal Flying Corps as an observer, he and his pilot fly over the lines and take photos, and we are told that the generals ignore their observations because what senseless clods those public-school warmongers were ho ho ho. I probably don't need to tell you commanders of the British Army did not totally ignore aerial observation; the Royal Flying Corps was part of the fucking army, there's a reason such aerial observation existed. There were isolated incidents in 1914 where the occasional general trusted his cavalry rather than his aeroplanes, but after the First Battle of the Marne was won partially because aerial observation spotted the famous gap in the German line this attitude had died down. The critical role of the Royal Flying Corps observations drew specific praise from British leaders in the field, and quinessential donkey-leading-the-lions Douglas Haig himself informed RFC general Hugh Trenchard he'd postpone the Battle of Neuve-Chapelle if aerial observation was impossible.\n\nCowan has _such a bee in his bonnet_ about snobby, ignorant, out-of-touch Brits it's hilarious, and compromises his few hopes of remaining accurate even on non-Bishop-related material. Bishop, for exaple, is apparently an observer because of his nationality. \"Pilots,\" we are told, \"come from the British upper class. Colonials need not apply.\" This, firstly, shits all over the RFC's observers, who had a job every bit as difficult and as dangerous as their pilots' and were specially trained for it. It's no exaggeration to say that it was the observers who were doing the work winning the war, and a pilot's job to either ferry him around or keep other pilots from killing him, _and the pilots knew it_. Secondly, even the part that isn't slander is untrue.\n\nAt this point Bishop has just been sent to England with \"his nerves shot\" after \"three undistinguished months\" (the narrator somehow forgets that Bishop has seriously injured his knee), meaning it is the middle of 1916. The first Canadian to fly operationally with the Royal Flying Corps in France was Captain Frederick Wanklyn, like Bishop an alumnus of the Royal Military College, who was a flight commander with No. 4 Squadron by November 1914^[5]. At the time of Bishop's return to England there are three Canadian pilots on the roster of No. 24 Squadron alone: Lieutenant R. H. B. Ker, Second Lieutenant A. E. McKay, and Lieutenant A. G. Knight^[6]. No. 24 Squadron was the first dedicated single-seater scout (what we would today call \"fighter\") squadron in British service under the command of war hero Lanoe Hawker VC, and a hugely prestigious assignment. With the Battle of the Somme coming up there were RFC recruitment posters up around Canada and the Curtiss Flying School in Toronto, set up to send pilots straight to RFC training, was full to capacity. And this is just off the top of my head, omitting Australians, South Africans, other countries that I don't live in and therefore know less about. Many of these pilots were extremely well-known, Knight and McKay became aces, this sort of information is hard to miss.\n\nThere was snobbery in the Royal Flying Corps and public-school pilots were over-represented, not least because most aspiring pilots had to pay for their own training until the second half of the war. But Bishop wasn't as much of an outsider as all that.\n\nThe next several minutes proceed through Bishop's training with ltitle objection: the narrator's tone is consistently insulting and tries to paint Bishop as a poor pilot, which is not supported by the record^[7]. But then the Battle of Verdun hits. (By \"then\", I of course mean \"the Battle of Verdun has been ongoing for several months by this point of the narrative, but the narrator pretends it starts now.\") \"The Generals\", that nefarious gang of incompetent butchers, defend a useless slab of concrete to the death of a million men, and to distract from the carnage \"invent a new hero: the air ace.\"\n\nFirst, contrary to popular belief \"The Generals\" were not a sinister cabal of dictators who pulled the strings of the home front with cunning precision while conducting the war with senseless brutality. Second, French aviators had been public heroes long before Verdun. Roland Garros, of tennis court fame, and Adolphe Pégoud were already renowned for their exploits, with Pégoud appearing on postcards wearing his Legion of Honour before dying in August 1915. The British policy, on the other hand, was that glorifying the single-seater scout pilot would denegrate the observers, two-seater pilots, air mechanics, etc. etc. ad nauseum who were every bit as vital^[8]. (Experience has shown they were correct.) The young, handsome, educated, personably shy super-pilot Albert Ball became a celebrity in Britain quite against the will of those nefarous generals. A semi-regular complaint in some war memoirs from the 1916-17 period, like Arthur Gould-Lee's, was that British pilots knew more about _German_ aces than their own, because the Germans made great heroes out of men like Boelcke, Immelmann, the von Richthofen brothers, Voss, etc.\n\n\"An ace, The Generals decide, will be any pilot who shoots down five enemy aircraft.\" The Royal Flying Corps never recognized the concept of an \"ace\" at all, and crediting The Generals with the nebulous concept (that was not universially codified as five victories until after the war) is unsupported by any evidence.\n\nBishop, meanwhile, is a slob with a \"lamentable\" record who has \"never fired on an enemy plane\" (not so odd, for an observer in early 1916) and \"committed numerous acts of insubordination.\"^[citation ^needed] Even Bishop's most strident modern detractors don't try to make the habitual insubordination charge stick, and remember that part of the so-called \"Billy Bishop myth\" was that he was unconditionally trusted and molly-coddled by his superiors.\n\nWhile inspecting Bishop's squadron, Colonel J. F. A. Higgins, commander 3rd Brigade RFC, watches Bishop bring in his Nieuport 17 and stuff the landing. The Nieuport 17 is a very light aircraft, designed for manouverability; like most pilots, Bishop had trained on clumsier machines including the senile-from-birth B.E.12. The film tells us that Bishop totally wrecked; in reality it appears he only cracked a longeron, a bad thing but locally repairable^[9]. Bishop is slated to return to England for remedial training but given one last chance by his adoring commanding officer (the film)/is allowed to remain at the squadron until a replacement is available (the real world). The next day (the film)/a few days later (real life), Bishop goes up in his Nieuport 17 and gets into a dogfight with the brand new plywood-bodied Albatros C.III (the film), a two seater mostly used for observation and light bombing jobs/the older Albatros D.II, a single-seat scout (the real world; a stupid mistake, and the fight is described like a dogfight between single-seaters). Bishop shoots down an Albatros in flames (the film)/claimed destroyed (the real world; another stupid mistake, but assuming every victory is a flamer is a common trait of somebody who's read nothing about the war)^[10].\n\nJust to make sure you get the point that this senseless slaughter by The Generals to fool the stooges at home, the stock footage of some German plane blowing up is bookended by clips of a crowd at a soccer game standing up in excitement, then sitting down in disappointment. The Generals are said to demand more kills. (Cowan constantly confuses \"victory\" and \"kill\".) (From this point on, please assume that the narration is calling The Generals as bloody-thirsty dictators who are the worst human beings who have ever lived; I have grown tired of pointing it out.)\n\nWe soon see the only historian quoted at any point in the documentary, British journalist and military historian Alexander McKee, whose specialist was the _Mary Rose_ and had little or nothing to do with First World War aviation. It's curious that no specialists were consulted.\nHe appears only briefly, doesn't have much to say, and doesn't get much wrong when he says it, and while his knowledge seems superficial that might be a product of the editing that's got an agenda to push. So I will let McKee rest. No, we get _real_ good here: Cowan's about to launch his real attack.\n\nThe first we hear about fraud in _The Kid Who Couldn't Miss_ is when Paul Cowan is interviewing Cecil Knight and he drops the bombshell, from an interview with an \"A. James\" Cowan heard at the Imperial War Museum, that James believed Billy Bishop's war record was fraudulent, that Bishop was cheating deliberately, and this was generally known in the Flying Corps. Knight, it need not be said, responds with extreme disgust and disbelief. Knight's categorical denial is just about the only truly fair moment in the \"docu-drama\".\n\nThe \"A. James\" in question is very probably Sir Archibald James, an RFC officer and later MP who never served with Bishop, interviewed by David Lance. Many of the IWM's interviews of First World War figures have been digitized in recent years but that one apparently hasn't, so we can't check up on this. But I've heard quite a few of the digitized interviews; none of them have assaulted Bishop's record. I've read memoirs from contemporary RFC pilots like Sir Gordon Taylor who didn't have entirely good things to say about Bishop but certainly didn't accuse him of fraud. Fellow Canadian Victoria Cross-winning ace Billy Barker liked and trusted Bishop enough to go into the aviation business with him postwar. In the aftermath of _The Kid Who Couldn't Miss_ Leigh F. Stevenson, a Canadian politician and former Royal Flying Corps pilot, posted a letter citing the support of fellow Canadian RFC pilots Donald MacLaren, Nick Carter, and George Howsam and praising Bishop's character and honesty^[11]. (MacLaren, Canada's second-leading RFC ace in the First World War, would have moved up quite considerably in the history books were Bishop to be discredited.)\n\nThere's a fake interview with a ground mechanic who hears allegations against Bishop and very carefully phrases his response to not deny it. It's not in a totally documentary format (modern colour in an anachronistic First World War-style hangar) but it also isn't part of the play that had been, hereto, the only overt fiction. This mechanic returns later to all-but-accuse Bishop of fraud. Needless to say every second of this is complete fiction. A letter home in which Bishop, telling tall tales, says he got seven victories in a patrol but didn't do nearly so well is regurgitated. Well, if the charge is that Bishop, like many people, bigged himself up, he's guilty. He also claimed victories he didn't get, which was literally universal: you probably noticed that there was a war on, and in thirty-second encounters with several participants on either side linking one pilot definitively to one victory was all but impossible. The RFC was, anyway, the combatant with by far the most relaxed victory standards for all its pilots. Post war analysis suggests that the proportion of Bishop's victories that can be linked to specific German losses is near or a bit better than average for a British ace^[12].\n\nA dogfight between Bishop and Manfred von Richthofen (which did happen) is given play-by-play like a sporting event, complete with shots of an enraptured crowd and a public address announcer giving monster truck-style updates. Manfred, in an anachronistic Fokker Dr.I triplane (he was flying a biplane Albatros D.V), gets the better of Bishop but his brother Lothar von Richthofen's \"Dr.7\" (not a real plane, and a biplane is shown on screen when \"Dr.\" means triplane) gets in trouble, Manfred is distracted, and Bishop fights the Red Baron to a scrappy draw. The chronology is all wrong: this fight, von Richthofen's eightieth and last victory, his head injury, and his death are combined into a very short period when there was a year between them. Not long after, in filmic terms, Bishop goes on leave; it is stated that he cut his leave short because James McCudden passed his victory total but Bishop was actually out of action from August 1917 to April 1918 and did not return to France until May.\n\nNow, here's my favourite part of the film. So far, and later, Cowan has been smearing Bishop as a blood-thirsty fraudster and The Generals as the worst monsters of mankind. Now, just for the hell of it, Cowan slanders three French aces: Georges Guynemer, earlier portrayed as a hard-partying womanizer rather than the rather shy, brave man he was, dies (he actually died in September 1917 while Bishop was on leave.) The second-leading ace, Nungesser, \"is the next hero to fall\" (actually Nungesser survived the war and died in a flying accident in 1927). The third-leading ace, Jean Navarre, is said to have killed himself in an asylum after going insane from the stress. This is _the most disgraceful lie_: Navarre, not one of the top aces, suffered a serious head wound in 1916, spent time in a sanatorium, recovered, returned to service in 1918, survived the war, but was killed accidentally in an attempt to fly through the Arc de Triomphe as the senior surviving French ace and a most informal representative of their air service. All three deaths were widely publicized and if Cowan didn't know how Nungesser and Navarre died why'd he put them in the movie? I'm trying to put myself into the mind of a screenwriter who'd invent that sort of story and present it as fact to try and make a point. I'm trying. I can't do it.\n\nPlease don't rely on this \"docudrama\" for the smallest amount of docu. If you see Paul Cowan in the street, spit in his face.\n\nCompared to that disgusting display, the many, many, many remaining deceits in this nightmare are relatively minor. Bishop goes up to do his Victoria Cross-winning raid on an aerodrome. (Chronologically off: he'd done it already, in 1917.) He prepares then leaves, quietly, without talking to anyone. (Untrue: he was desperate for a companion and tried to talk his deputy leader, Willy Fry, into coming along.)^[13] The attack is given as Estourmel, which was probably not the correct location: this isn't particularly Cowan's fault, since Estourmel was widely accepted as the site of the raid and Bishop himself wasn't sure which aerodrome he hit; modern scholarship says it was probably Esmes. The play takes over from here, Oscar from Corner Gas taking us through the events in a fictional version of Bishop's head. He's flying low, the sun is only just rising, he's terrified, the aerodrome comes into view, flights are taking off to intercept him, he can only skid around, fight back as best he can, run for it when it's too much, but by his boldness having brought down several aircraft and caused havoc. By far, the overtly fictional play is the most accurate thing in this part of the film.\n\nRemember that fake interview with the mechanic I talked about earlier? He's back! And this fictional mechanic is now the expert for the prosecution. We are told that Bishop came back with his Lewis light machine gun missing (probably not true; this story pre-dates Cowan but squadron records indicate no missing gun). The narrator gives us the official story that Bishop's aircraft returned in tatters, then our fictional mechanic says that, on the contrary, the damage to Bishop's Nieuport was a suspiciously tight grouping in a non-vital area. (Citation _seriously_ needed; every reputable source states that Bishop's aircraft had sustained significant damage to the bottom from ground fire). It is implied that Bishop landed his Nieuport, removed the Lewis gun, shot up his aircraft harmlessly, and flew away. This would have been physically impossible: the Nieuport 17 had no brakes so Bishop would have had to stop the engine to get out, and it had no self-starter so Bishop would have needed assistance on the ground to take off again. In addition, as the Nieuport 17 was a structurally sub-standard aircraft that sometimes fell to pieces from ordinary flying, deliberately damaging the thing then risking an extra startup, takeoff, and climb, would not have been the brightest move of Bishop's career.\n\nWe are informed, by the narrator, that German records do not indicate that Bishop's aerodrome raid, and everyone knows _zee efficient Zhermans keep zee excellent recordz_. They didn't, actually: the German air force was not a bunch of hyperefficient hardworking stereotypes, they were people, and gaps in their records are well-known to historians. In particular, an overwhelming number of squadron logbooks were lost during the Second World War, with the only surviving information being some hand-copied research by a German historian from the 1920s pursuing his own inquiries. We get an old story that Bishop was recommended for the Victoria Cross with no confirmation: it would be more accurate to say that any confirmation of Bishop's Victoria Cross does not survive, and contrary to the tale of glittering brasshats practically pinning the VC to Bishop's chest when he got out of his Nieuport, it took two months for the award to become official. Many VC records, including Bishop's, were recycled in the ordinary course of events, as if the British Army was selfishly not considering that future filmmakers would decide the whole thing didn't happen. Accounts of Bishop's raid from witnesses do survive, though none are unimpeachable.\n\nThis is actually important. Cowan's film started a minor cottage industry in condemning Bishop as a liar and a fraud. This \"docu-drama\" has led to books, scholarship, endless research, a microscope over Bishop's every twitch in an aircraft comment, his every self-aggrandizing letter home, his lousy, propagandistic wartime memoir _Winged Victory_, his habit of lone patrols, his commanding officer's trust in him. Nowadays if a non-historian knows about Billy Bishop he probably \"knows\" that he was a fraudster, and this embarrassing work is what started the whole genre. This is what bad history can do when unchecked.\n\n---\n\n[1] &amp;mdash; The Canadian Press. \"Senate to re-examine film about war ace Billy Bishop.\" _Ottawa Citizen_, May 29, 1986, E1. http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19860529&amp;id=dL8yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lO8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1270,4638839  \n[2] &amp;mdash; McKenzie, J.

But an interesting example of what I mean: only 11 Victoria Crosses were awarded to members of the Royal Flying Corps and of these five (Bishop, Hawker, Ball, Jerrard, McCudden) went to dogfighting fighter pilots.

Since Fry had died between the filming and the hearing, this was very convenient. But friends of Fry's have said that Cowan contacted Fry but Fry refused to see him.

But one idiot decided that his terrible opinions about movies were not enough, he needed to share his [terrible opinions about history](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/2o1jxh/why_scifi_keeps_imagining_the_subjugation_of/cmjhe32)\n\n&gt;European Colonialism benefits most people on the planet. From infrastructure to order to institutions, European colonialism provided the blueprint for civilization that was lacking, or non-existent, in most of the world.\n\nThe sheer mass of wrongness packed into such little volume is impressive. It's a badhistory black hole. Now, I'll let the math nerds pick apart the first sentence, while I explain the second. First off, I'm not actually sure what he means by \"providing the blueprint for civiliation'. He might mean that the infrastructure and institutions needed to send your countrymen abroad to mess with other societies is a blueprint for civilization. However, he likely means that the colonial era left many parts of the world with infrastructure, order, and institutions that were superior to the pre-colonial ones. \nThis is a tempting lie, if one does not know the history and structure of institutions, which are much harder to show cause and effect for than events like battles. Europe does have excellent instutions. They have strong, well run states with the rule of law and accountability mechanisms. Perfect? No, but it's easy to see why people look to Denmark for inspiration or even a \"blueprint\". This does not mean however that European colonialism was spread order and institutions to the rest of the world, even accidently. I'll get the R5 out of the way before the funner discussion about how institutions spread. \n\nEuropean colonization did not leave east Asians with improved order or institutions. China has had a recognizable state for over 2,000 years. Korea and Japan, likewise, have a long history of a centralized state organization. Also, they were never colonized by the West. Later on, he claims that Japan \"literally Western Colonized themselves\". Japan did not literally Western colonize themselves, because that's a nonsense sentence. It's something Steve Carrol's Anchorman character would say. Japan has a good economy because I love lamp makes equal sense. He's trying to say that Japan has a good economy because they adopted western institutions. This is true to some degree, but Japan did this because powerful people within Japanese political institutions decided to incorporate those western institutions into their society. It did not come from the moral drive of European colonialism. I do give some credit to the United States for helping set up better institutions in South Korea, especially compared to our friends in the North. But that was neither European nor colonialism. \n\nEuropean colonization did not leave southeast Asians with improved order or institutions. From 1400 to 1600, European trade did spur the centralization of power under absolutist rulers in SE Asia. In that sense, there was a institutionalization of power that we associate with a modern state. Colonialism fucked all that up. Here is Robinson and Acemoglu:\n\n&gt;The extractive institutions created by the Dutch in the Spice Islands had the desired effects, though, in Banda this was at the cost of fifteen thousand innocent lives and the establishment of a set of economic and political institutions that would condemn the islands to underdevelopment. By the end of the seventeenth century, the Dutch had reduced the world supply of these spices by about 60 percent and the price of nutmeg had doubled.\n\nThe result:\n\n&gt;The Dutch spread the strategy they perfected in the Moluccas to the entire region, with profound implications for the economic and political institutions of the rest of Southeast Asia. The long commercial expansion of several states in the area that had started in the fourteenth century went into reverse. Even the polities which were not directly colonized and crushed by the Dutch East India Company turned inward and abandoned trade. The nascent economic and political change in Southeast Asia was halted in its tracks.\n\nEuropean colonization did not leave Africans with improved order or institutions. This one has been done to death, so I'll let Fukuyama end this bad history: \n\n&gt;Africa did not possess states that were strong or modern prior to European colonialism. This was one reason why the continent could be conquered so easily. The legacy of late colonial rule in Africa was to undercut existing social structures—even when the explicit objective of policy was to preserve them—while failing to implant much by way of modern state institutions. . . .The weak postindependence African state was the heir to the weak colonial state.\n\nEuropean colonization did not leave the Americans with improved order and institutions, because those institutions were designed to hurt them. Fukuyama again: \n\n&gt;Colonial powers were most successful in implanting modern institutions in places where the indigenous peoples were so weak, small in numbers, and primitively organized that they could be effectively killed off by war or disease, herded into reservations, or otherwise eliminated from the picture.\n\nI don't know shit about India and when I don't know shit about a subject, I say \"Oy! I don't know shit\". It's my superpower. Someone else can confirm or deny the hypothesis of our friend at truefilm.\n\nFinally, he's wrong in a theoretical sense too. Institutions are not spread well to others by force or outsiders. The places where Europeans had the most success in transplanting there institutions without killing everyone in the process are places like Singapore and Hong Kong. Places where they could live for a long term and actually become part of the institution building process. In other words, where they themselves need to live under the institutions. As compared to, say, West Africa, where institutions were built under the assumption that most Europeans would stay temporally before moving on or dying from malaria. Even places like Korea, the United States didn't force a nation-state structure on Koreans. That existed long before. This paragraph is obviously the most arguable, since it's about nation building instead of history, so have at me!\n\nTl:dr - He should have said \"European Colonialism benefits most people on the planet who look like me\".   The rest of his posts on the subject are an amazing mush of bullshit. Seriously, go read it. Also, he's 42. Also, I think he's from my home state ㅠㅠ\n",

        "text": "[Original comment here](http://np.reddit.com/r/creepyPMs/comments/2o8dhe/i_ended_up_on_a_girls_best_friends_list_on/cmkx30d). \n\n&gt; I'm sure he's more of the ancient Greek \"women are just ovens for sperm\" type of guy though. \n\nBecause I'm currently procrastinating from working on my dissertation on precisely this subject, I'm going to go into this in far more detail than is strictly necessary for a (fairly amusing and not entirely wrong) throwaway comment.\n\nTo start with, \"ancient Greek\" is a fairly monolithic term for what was in fact a rather diverse set of cultures, only some of which we know enough about to have much to say about their views on really anything in particular, rather than just assuming (with, to be fair, fairly good reason) that mostly their views were probably pretty similar. It is usually the case, though, that \"ancient Greek\" means \"classical Athenian\".^1 I'll look at this post, then, as if that's what the poster meant.\n\nClassical Athens, to be sure, didn't exactly have a modern stance towards women's rights. \n\n&gt; That opposite of the citizen: woman^2\n\nis a fairly good summary of what it was like to be an Athenian woman in the 5^th Century. Athenian women weren't even referred to as Athenian women, let alone citizen women, they were referred to as  αι Αττικαι, i.e. \"women of Attica\". Non-Athenian women had an even worse deal, and slave-women the worst of all. (Neaera, about whom Demosthenes' 59^th oration is, starts out as a slave, where she works as a prostitute from before she even reaches puberty,^3 which is presented in the speech as due to her being insatiably lustful, rather than being a sex slave. When she becomes free, it is decided that she is her own mistress, rather than having a kurios.^4  This doesn't really help her when she runs away from an abusive relationship, and the court rules that she has to spend half her time with the person she's run away to, and half with the person she's run away from -- unless *they* mutually agree on a different arrangement! She doesn't get a say at all.^5 Basically, women's life in Athens sucked.)\n\nWomen weren't *just* seen as ovens for sperm, though. This is probably a reference to the famous passage from *Against Neaera* in which he writes:\n\n&gt; *hetaerae* we keep for the sake of our pleasures, *pallakai* for the daily care of our persons, and *gynaikai* to bear us legitimate children.^6\n\nEven here, we can see that women had two other roles than merely childbearing: looking after men, and sex. Okay, it's not exactly a concession which feminists around the world would be jumping up and down if they won today, but it's something.\n\n(EDIT: As is pointed out [below](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2o9xs7/im_sure_hes_more_of_the_ancient_greek_women_are/cmlat00), the reference is in fact to Aeschylus' *Eumenides*. This doesn't really change the points I make, though you'll note that the language is actually very close to what was used in the OP)\n\nWhat we have to remember, though, is the context in which this is said. It's part of a legal speech against a non-citizen ex-prostitute, who has been accused of passing off her daughter as the legitimate child of a citizen.^7 The comment is a dogwhistle to the jury, saying \"Neaera is a *hetaera*, a *pallake* at a stretch, and yet she's trying to usurp citizenship rights\". Indeed, law courts were entirely male spaces, and the things said inside them were at least to some extent constructions of what *should* be the case, rather than necessarily what was the case. It is, pace Winkler, an attempt to enforce androcentrism through controlling the public dialogue. \"Most of our surviving documents simply cannot be taken at face value when they speak of women\".^8\n\nIn fact, women had a rather better deal than would seem to be the case simply from reading *Against Neaera* uncritically. It's true that women weren't *meant* to be economic actors, and were forbidden from making any transactions worth more than a *medimnos* of barley, a fairly small amount,^9 but in reality they simply *did*. In *Against Spudias*, the speaker's mother-in-law lends her other son in law 1,800 talents (a huge sum).^10 In Hesiod's *Works and Days*, we are told that a good wife is more valuable for a farmer to have than oxen to pull the plow, and Aristotle (hardly a raging feminist) quotes this in Book I of his *Politics*. Speaking of the *Politics*, Aristotle's characterisation of the relationship between husband and wife is that of a democracy, or constitutional government, by contrast with the man's rule over children (kingship) and slaves (tyrrany). \n\nWomen also had a massively significant religious role. One of the few respectable public roles for them was in the ritual and religious sphere. Women went to funerals, and acted as mourners.^11 Women were allowed at the Eleusinian Mysteries, and at public sacrifices.^12 The wife of the archon-basileus had such an important religious role, as the ceremonial wife of Dionysius, that her being impure was held to endanger the city.^13 (They also had a women-only religious festival, the Thesmophoria). \n\nThey also had a social role, acting, for example as caregivers for their sick relatives.^14 \n\nIn conclusion, women had much more importance in Classical Athens (and elsewhere in ancient Greece, though I haven't addressed that as much) than being merely baby factories. Life for women in Classical Athens was fairly shit compared to that for the male elites, sure, but we have to remember that slaves, minors, the poor, the elderly, the mentally ill, those who had worked as prostitutes, and many others were all classes of men who got a raw deal relative to the elites. The precise ways in which life sucked for all these groups varied, as did the amount, but saying that life for women sucked because they were considered as nothing more than baby-making sperm repositories is a massive oversimplification of the situation.\n\n**References:**\n\n^1 Winkler, *The Constraints of Desire*, p.2 (I told you, I'm writing a dissertation on this stuff!)\n\n^2 Loraux, *The Children of Athena*, p.8\n\n^3 Demosthenes, LIX.22\n\n^4 Essentially a guardian.

Anyway, I did find [this shinning gem of badhistory](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2lymx0/what_is_the_closest_thing_to_magicsorcery_the/clzeyrd) further down:\n\n&gt;Everyone is talking about modern inventions, and they are impressive, but I like to think about how [the Hagia Sophia](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Hagia_Sophia_Mars_2013.jpg) looked to the people of Constantinople. It was built by the Byzantines at the height of their empire and was undoubtably the most impressive structure in the entire world. Then the empire collapsed and the engineering knowledge that built the church was lost. So for hundreds of years, generations of people lived in a city dominated by a building that no one on the planet understood. When we look at \"magic\" like iPhones and computers, some part of us knows that somewhere in the world is a group on engineers that understands every little bit of it. But not the Hagia Sophia. For hundreds of years these people worshiped in a building so advanced that they didn't even understand how it stood up.\n\nAs I understand it, this post was edited to remove mentions of Rome and replace them with Byzantium. This would have been badhistory because the Western Roman Empire fell in 476 and Hagia Sophia wasn't completed until 537, 61 years later. The problem is that the revision makes this badhistory even worse in a number of ways.\n\nFirst and most obviously is the timeline. The Eastern Roman Empire didn't fall until the Ottoman conquest in 1453 which means that even if we are as charitable as possible with the poster's claim that \"For hundreds of years these people worshiped in a building so advanced that they didn't even understand how it stood up\" and assume that people somehow lacked this advanced architectural knowledge until 1653 it would still leave us 27 years after the completion of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome in 1626, which for those of you playing at home looks like [this.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Tobu_World_Square_St_Peters_Basilica_2.jpg) \n\nSecond, knowledge of engineering on the scale of Hagia Sophia was not lost to the West at all after the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire. [The Cathedral of Saint Mary of the See](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville_Cathedral), a larger cathedral than Hagia Sophia, was completed in Andalusia in 1507, 54 years later. Additionally, many of the Christian mathematicians, engineers, and architects who were responsible for large scale projects in the Eastern Empire fled to Christian kingdoms in the West after the fall of Constantinople. \n\nThe third reason this is badhistory is that it assumes that the architectural and engineering processes that made it possible to build Hagia Sophia where for some reason lost or unknown to the Islamic world in general and the Ottoman Turks specifically. In fact, large scale construction of domed temples and palaces was relatively common in Persia, the Levant, Islamic Anatolia, and the rest of what is now the Middle East. This included buildings like [Qal'eh Dokhtar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qal%27eh_Dokhtar) (209), [the Sassanid Palace at Sarvestan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarvestan_Palace) (c. early 5th century), [The Dome of the Rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome_of_the_Rock) (458), [the Al-Aqsa Mosque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque) (705), [the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Mosque) (715), and [the Bursa Grand Mosque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursa_Grand_Mosque) (1399) which is located in the city that was the Ottoman capital before the capture of Constantinople. I'm not saying that the OP came to this conclusion because of casual racism but, well, if the shoe fits.\n\nAll of this also ignores the fact that Hagia Sophia went through a major structural refit sometime during the reign of Ottoman Sultan Salim II (1566–1574) which was supervised by Mimar Sinan, whose students would go on to design the [Taj Mahal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal#mediaviewer/File:Taj_Mahal_2012.jpg) which was, ironically, completed in 1653.\n\nInterestingly, the top child comment to this post is also [a different but related type](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2lymx0/what_is_the_closest_thing_to_magicsorcery_the/clzhsxy) of badhistory:\n\n&gt;Reading about stuff like this makes The Foundation series so interesting to me\n\nThis one requires a little unpacking. \n\nThe Foundation Series of novels, written by Isaac Asimov and initially published between 1942 and 1993, are largely premised on a science fiction interpretation of the fall of the Western Roman Empire as told by 18th century historian Edward Gibbon in his series of books *The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*. While Gibbon is rightfully credited with introducing a rigorous methodology to the study of the Roman Empire, he has been subsequently criticized by modern historians like Norwich and Luttwak for minimizing the role of the Eastern Roman Empire and various non-Roman groups by popularizing the so called Dark Ages as the post-Western Empire *status quo*. This is factually inaccurate because, as we've already covered, the fall of the Empire in the West did not lead to an irrevocable loss of knowledge and expertise in the Eastern Empire or in much of the non-Roman world. *Foundation* is still a great piece of science fiction, but it's a flawed historical analogy for the Western Roman Empire, not the Eastern Empire.\n\nI want to thank Daeres, shannondoah, cordismelum, and rysnott_ on the IRC for giving me ideas for this post.",

        "text": "I bring you today an unusual example of Bad History; as per the title, it involves historical geography. But unlike most of my usual badhistory, which revolves around one particular source in some way or another, it's far wider in scope, because this actually covers most other professional and amateur maps of the same thing. However, I feel the need to offer up a scapegoat, so I shall pick upon a particular map.\n\n[Behold](http://www.penn.museum/sites/iraq/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/stand-or-ur-city-state-mapfront-OL-MA.jpg).\n\nIn anticipation of several guesses, I'm not about to point out an incorrect map label, or a badly spelled one. Neither am I about to problematise the idea of Akkad and Sumer. Nor am I going to tell you that one of the cities is in the wrong place. I *might* complain that there's no date range given, which makes the map harder to contextualise for someone unfamiliar with these sites. In fact I just did, ignore the 'might'. But that problem is specific to this map in particular, whereas I pointed out that this problem is true for almost every single map of a particular kind.  \n\nInstead, we're going to talk about both the coastline, and the course of the rivers Tigris, Euphrates, and Karkheh (probably). *But first we're going to talk about Ur.*\n\nThis site is very, very old indeed. It is actually not the source of the phrase 'ur-example', nor the originator of the *ur-* prefix, both derive from an existing root in Germanic languages. But consider it a rather lovely piece of historical coincidence that these two things should resemble one another. It was first excavated in the mid-19th century, though it had been known for centuries beforehand- bricks kept turning up, unsurprisingly- and is one of the most foundational excavations of Mesopotamian archaeology. The site itself has been inhabited for a very long time, most estimates I found gave a rough estimate of 6800 BC for its oldest observable date of occupation. But in the context of this map, Ur first becomes Super Serious City in the early 3rd millenium BC- the first King of Ur to feature on Sumerian King Lists dates from the 26th century BC, although the urban site almost certainly predates that in some form. And in the context of this map, that is roughly the era it purports to cover.\n\nSo why did I pick on Ur? This is why I picked on Ur. *Would you ever guess, from looking at this map, that Ur was originally a coastal city*? \n\nThis introduces us the meat of this regular Bad Historical Geography; almost any map you see of ancient Mesopotamia, or the ancient Persian Gulf, only utilises the current coastlines of the Gulf. If you look on that map, consider that Ur was coastal, and then compare that fact to where the current coastline is shown, you can see that there is quite a huge difference between the foundation of the city and now. The problem here is not that the modern coastline is shown- in order to understand the relationship of these sites to present day geography, it makes sense. The problem is, in my opinion, that so few maps visually indicate that this was not always thus, especially when the differences across human history have been so enormous. That's why I think this is worth pointing out, rather than regarding it as pointless trivia.\n\nSo if the changes were so large across the past few millenia that Ur used to be coastal, you might reasonably expect that other nearby pieces of geography would be similarly different, and you'd be right. There would have been a large body of salt water between Sumer and Elam as indicated on that map, for one. But also, the Tigris and Euphrates would not have had that confluence before reaching the Gulf, not by the time of Ur's foundation. That single river that they become is the titular *Shatt al-Arab*, also known as the *Arvand Rud* in Persian. It would not have had any existence in the 26th century BC, nor indeed the 20th century BC. I actually don't have a date to hand as to when it emerged. But the important part is that it would not have existed in the timeframe that this map, and most other maps like it, covers. Additionally, the Karkheh river is the one which flows into the Shatt al-Arab just below the confluence on that map, yet in that period it actually emptied straight into the sea and had no such confluence. This is even incorrectly stated on the river's wikipedia page. The same would have been true for the Karun river- it's not labelled on this map, but is on others, as both rivers are very close to the site of Susa. In addition, the course of both Tigris and Euphrates have both radically altered over the past 4,600 years, even before they flow into the sea. It's only armed with this that some of the city placements on that map make any sense; several cities seem to be in the middle of nowhere, in regions which are now arid.\n\nThe fact is, these differences are enough to heavily affect the spatial perception of Sumer and surrounding regions. Not only that, they're also enough to affect how you understand how they interacted with one another. And it seems absolutely ridiculous to illustrate the region without illustrating a radical geographic shift over time (I'll show you just how radically the Persian Gulf has changed across the past 15,000 years lower down).\n\nThere are, fortunately, a number of maps which do attempt to accurately illustrate the geography of the time (partially, it's still missing the Central channel which a number of ancient cities were founded next to), and I am picking this one because I happen to like it.\n\n[Behold](https://kmjantz.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/map01-02.jpg).\n\nMy one complaint with this one is that the label for Babylonia is rather... on the extreme edge of where Babylonia was. It's clearly been done due to the giant MESOPOTAMIA text, which is understandable, but it does mean that Babylonia doesn't actually seemed to be labelled as covering the city of Babylon for which it's named. Also having Assyria+Babylonia labelled on the same map as Akkad+Sumer is rather like having a map of France which has Gallia+Aquitania+Belgica labelled alongside Langue d'Oil and Langue d'Oc. \n\nOkay I'm nitpicky about maps.\n\nBut my point is that I'd be interested to know if you found your perception of this period changing as you looked at the two different maps.\n\nA much more detailed examination of the processes at work in the Persian Gulf, and its state in this period, can be found [here](http://www.archatlas.org/EnvironmentalChange/EnvironmentalChange.php).\n\nYou can and will find maps on the internet (other than the ones I've linked you to) which do show some form of the differing coastline, which is good. But you will now be able to actually notice and possible care about the difference between the ones which do, and the ones which don't. Whether you find it as irritating as I do when academic or teaching maps don't show the different coastline is in the hands of the gods.\n\n**Appendix- How much the Persian Gulf varies over time**\n\nTo put it simply, the Persian Gulf changes a *lot*. In c.13,000 BC, there basically was no Persian Gulf at all, it was all above sea level and dominated by a single enormous river system. There's actually a lot of work been done to do with working out the level of human interaction with the pre-flooded Gulf, it's often described as having been a shelter from some of the extremes of climate during the last glacial period. However, due to several global processes, it slowly began to fill with water again. But that too reached its high watermark, and since the foundation of Ur has been starting to fill up again. A lot of this is due to rather extreme silting- they have to continually clear the Shatt al-Arab in order to keep it navigable these days.\n\n[This is yet another internet based resource illustrating some of the shifts in the past 15 millenia or so](http://emvc.geol.ucsb.edu/2_infopgs/IP2IceAge/ePersGulfFlood.gif).\n\n**Additional Materials**\n\nThis is a pretty well evidenced basic premise, I feel.

Most of the Nazi apology stuff has been chewed up and down pretty often, so I was using sources sparingly. But I can put up sources for all that stuff.\n\nSo this thread is completly full with nazi apologism, fandom, myths and everything, but I will pick some out that were the worst (I've seen). I've had some great exchanges. If you've seen the movie, the conversation started over the ~~SS-Oficer~~ Wehrmacht Feldwebel who was killed by the Bear jew. Some people think that he is a great hero for saving other German soldiers. I didn't. But the movie is just a prelude to all that classic Nazi apologism trivia.\n\nThis is my first submit so please be soft on me. As soft as those poor conscipted SS-Men everywhere.\n\n&gt;He willfully served and protected the nazisystem\n&gt;&gt;He was a Wermacht officer, all he did was save the life of his men. He may have not even been a Nazi supporters.\n\nYeah, the Wehrmacht had nothing to do with the Nazis. i just leave this classic here. http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2byfzw/just_following_orders_the_myth_of_the_clean_and/\n\n\n&gt;[the nazi-system]whose only purpose was to murder people and destroy cultures.\n&gt;&gt;The USA was founded on this, does that mean Washington was an evil person? Or can we view men as complex and contradictory who hold within them a host of virtue and sin.\n\nHelloooo. Obviously the USA were founded on the purpose of exterminating various ethnicities and other \"Unwertes Leben\", and Washington is about the same as Hitler. But we shouldn't judge those Nazis anyway, because people are complex and others also have done shitty things. (I didn't even know that all men (women obviously not) have tried to exterminate complete ethnicities).\n\n\n(the whole and I will pick some quotes out of it again)\n\n&gt;Dude you realize most of the nazis did not know aboutany of the gruesome stuff the nazi state was doing at the time? And then do you realize not all of the germans, both civilians and fighters, were nazis? Finally, do you realize that american people droped two bombs in civiloan towns and allied with the russians, the people who did more gruesome stuff than the nazis? Because if you do not realize of this you are just an ignorant prick. This are all facts. Being the bad russia the most polemic one, but still a real one. Russians chinese and japanese did some of the worst criminal and massive stuff of the xx century. Nazis? Bad seed indeed the nazi state was. But the pottential worse? Nope. And the most damaging one? Neither. Because we destroyed it more quickly than the other ones.\n\n.\n\n&gt;Dude you realize most of the nazis did not know aboutany of the gruesome stuff the nazi state was doing at the time?\n\n\nOh my dear. The old myth that nobody knew. Oh yeah, nobody knew, despite neighbouring jews \"mysteriously\" vanishing, and pogroms on the street, and the stated wish in Hitlers book to exterminate the jews. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_for_the_Holocaust#The_German_people\n\nIt gets worse.\n\n&gt;And then do you realize not all of the germans, both civilians and fighters, were nazis? Finally, do you realize that american people droped two bombs in civiloan towns and allied with the russians, the people who did more gruesome stuff than the nazis?\n\nPlease stop. That non-logic kills me. So the German people weren't all Nazis, that is actually true, but doesn't even make it better. The German people actually could resist, as is shown by the stoppage of the Aktion T4 (extermination of disabled people) due to public outrage. So the German people aren't at fault for the holocaust, but literally \"the American people\" dropped two atomic bombs on the japanese. And I thought it were two planes with soldiers in it who dropped them. Further, I am now in the know that \"the Russians\" (only them, not all the other ethnicities in the Soviet Union) did worse than the Nazis. So, the Stalinist Soviet Union has done many crimes, but none were the extermination of complete ethnicities and starting a War of Aggression against half the world.\n\n\n&gt;Nazis? Bad seed indeed the nazi state was. But the pottential worse? Nope. And the most damaging one? Neither. Because we destroyed it more quickly than the other ones.\n\nOh hey, the Nazis aren't that bad. They only started a war that took 50 million lifes, de facto destroyed jewish life in Europe and destroyed half of Eastern Europe. But that is not that bad because it only took them 6 years. Then our antifascist friend here and his gang stopped them. Good job defeating those Nazis. And I'm glad to see 89 year old people using the Internet, good job Gramps!\n\n\nHere comes another hero.\n\n&gt;It's kind of a circlejerk on reddit that \"apologists\" are bad. I disagree, apologists are the people who go against public opinion, who think past peer pressure.\nIt's much more complicated than \"Nazis were bad so this guy was bad\". That's a ridiculously simplistic way of seeing it. Not every member of the Wehrmacht was a Jew hating Nazi who supported the Holocaust. Just like in the American South during the Civil War. Not every southerner supported slavery, but many simply wanted to defend their home, have loyalty to the South.\nDying to protect your fellow soldiers, your friends, that goes right past ideology. I've heard veterans say that on the front lines you're not fighting for cultural ideas, or government, you're fighting for the brothers beside you, and dying for them. That's noble, that's brave.\nThe US has done terrible shit as well, from massacres in Vietnam to toppling democratic governments for our own interests. We're not necessarily the good guys either, but we still see nobility in sacrifice.\nAre you really going to shrug people off as \"apologists\" because they try to see everyone, even their enemies, as people?\n\n.\n\n&gt;It's kind of a circlejerk on reddit that \"apologists\" are bad. I disagree, apologists are the people who go against public opinion, who think past peer pressure. Could be a crosspost to /r/conspiratard.\n\nOh those great heros, going against actual historic science (we all obviously know that history is written and that historians get paid by the winners. Therefore we are all a bunch truth hiding worse-than-the-nazis)\n\n&gt;Dying to protect your fellow soldiers, your friends, that goes right past ideology. I've heard veterans say that on the front lines you're not fighting for cultural ideas, or government, you're fighting for the brothers beside you, and dying for them. That's noble, that's brave.\n\nNot in my world is dying because assholes started a war over their hatred some noble thing. Yeah, many soldiers weren't fighting for nazi goals, but because they were forced and tried to survive. They weren't fighting for it, but because of it. At the heart of nearly everything we talk about WW2 lies the National Socialst aggression against a whole host of people, because of its ideology. I find this to be offensive, as if people who were fighting were mindless drones who had no agency and just did what was expected of them. Many, maaany people who were forced to fight in the second World War didn't have such a high opinion of nearly dying in the mud for some bullshit ideology. There is nothing noble and nothing brave about dying in a war.\n\n&gt;Hans Landa is so smooth that I root for him, even after he chokes out Bridget von Hammersmark. And the Nazi officer who gets bashed with the bat was a very honorable and brave character. I was not cheering for him to be killed. Hitler is obviously a psycho, but even he gets in a humanizing compliment to his secretary, and later to Goebbels, soon before he's executed.\n\nThis guy here thinks roots for a character who sees his murder of jews as aking to hunting rats. That is completly not wierd.\n\n&gt;Were all Nazis bad people? To be worthy of being dehumanized? What about men conscripted into the SS? What about average people who were members of the Nazi party but who's biggest crime was working in a factory?\n\nWere all Nazis Nazis? What about the Nazis that were totally just Nazis because it brought them benefits in their everyday lifes? And I am really baffled that to me it seems that in the last decade it seems as if general ideas about the SS shifted from \"Elite-Nazi Organisation\" to \"they were bigger victims than the Volkssturm\" and all of them conscripted Hiwis.\n\n&gt;What is the difference between you and a nazi? Are they less human because of the time and place of their birth or are they genetically prone to cruelty and hatred? How can you be so sure that you would be any different under identical circumstances?\n\nThis is something that offends me personally very much. The apology that you could be a Nazi. Some people don't even have the demand on themselves to be better than people who did the only industrial genocide in mankinds history, even though nothing is forcing them to lay their demands so low. It is aching to \"I would have totally been a Nazi because everyone was and that's why the Nazis aren't that bad\". I hate it.\n\n\nAnother guy:\n\n\n&gt;nazisystem whose only purpose was to murder people and destroy cultures\n&gt;&gt;That is a bold statement.\n\nI really don't know what's so bold about it. Because they built the allmighty Autobahn^to_transport_troops_easier?",

        "text": "(I am well aware that this is /u/khosikulu's turf. Please don't kill me. I just want to be like you. :()\n\nI was trying to find a good, kid-friendly introduction to South African history, and stumbled across [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwBOgDwZkAI) instead. It's not kid friendly. It's not a good history of South Africa. It's not even a terribly good video. It's just baffling. \n\nThe history of South Africa stretches back long before the arrival of Europeans. The oldest hominids found in South Africa [are at least 2.2 million years old](http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/new-study-says-hominid-found-in-south-africa-and-known-as-little-foot-may-have-been-humans-oldest-ancestor/story-fnjwl2dr-1226855400174), showing that people have been there for quite some time. Even if hominids don't count as people, sites like the [Klasies River Caves](http://archaeology.about.com/cs/humanorigins/a/klasiesriver.htm) in the Eastern Cape contain tools and human remains that are at least 125 000 years old. People have been in South Africa for a long, long time. \n\nWhat people, though? What is the history of these people who were in South Africa before 1652? The San are one of the first recognisable groups in South Africa, and indeed, are one of the oldest human populations in the world. Their particular genetic pattern has been dated to 80 000 years ago, and San artifacts such as ostrich eggshell beads and rock art have been found in South Africa dating back to 25 000 years ago. Engraving, too, goes back 11 000 years. The San themselves were hunter-gatherers, and while they had no written language, that doesn't erase the fact that they were there, recording their experiences, and creating their own histories. Just because we don't know as much about this history, and just because it isn't a history recorded in cities, books, and the like doesn't mean it's a history that doesn't exist. \n\nThe same sort of ideas apply to the Khoekhoe. While we don't know exactly what the history of the Khoekhoe is, we do know that there is a history. The Khoekhoe were likely not originally in South Africa, though this, as with many things related to the history and origins of the Khoekhoe, is debated. In his article \"Kinship, Language and Production: A Conjectural History of Khoisan Social Structure,\" Alan Barnard makes the case that the idea of the Khoekhoe migrating into South Africa from Central or East Africa is unlikely, but his is not a majority view. One theory looks at the economic and social differences between the Khoekhoe and the San - namely that one is pastoral while the other is a hunter-gatherer culture - and argues that the Khoekhoe migrated into South Africa around 2500 to 2000 years ago, bringing their animals and social structure with them. However, other theories state that the Khoekhoe had always been in southern Africa, and just developed domestication there. It's a matter of some debate. That said, there is some evidence that the San had developed pottery and domestication before the arrival of the Khoekhoe, but once again, it's a history we are unlikely to ever know with certainty.\n\nRegardless, though, the Khoekhoe and the San represent two groups who were in South Africa long before 1652, and who had a history that is as much a part of South Africa as anything else. They are an indelible part of the country, and excluding them from a history is more than a little baffling. \n\nBut let's continue our whirlwind tour of South African history. Around 300 CE, Bantu peoples (whose later descendants include groups like the Xhosa, Zulu, and Tswana, among others) arrived in South Africa, pushing the Khoekhoe and San out of the more fertile land and into the more arid regions around the Kalahari. They brought with them iron tools, new crops, and new languages. The impact on South Africa was massive. Agriculture thrived, and cities and kingdoms began to emerge. There is evidence as well of irrigation and of the courses of rivers being changed by these Bantu farmers. They also brought with them their cattle, changing the economic and political system of southern Africa. They brought with them, for instance, strict gender roles and social stratification, something which differed wildly from what the Khoikhoi and San had had. By the 7th century CE, we see evidence of Iron Age settlements in the Transvaal. These settlements had complex trade relations with the east coast of Africa and with settlements further north. Indeed, there is a great deal of evidence for complex trade routes in southern and South Africa. The [Kingdom of Mapungubwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Mapungubwe) from the 11th century contains evidence of permanent walls and stone buildings, as well as artifacts from as far away as China. It had intricate gold and copper jewellery as well, showing the population's mastery of metalworking. Its rise and fall had a large impact on southern Africa, and while it wouldn't be as well remembered as kingdoms like the Kingdom of Zimbabwe, it was a trading and cultural hub at the height of its power. Indeed, even when the Portuguese arrived, kingdoms like the [Kingdom of Mutapa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Mutapa) were thriving, heavily implying there was history in South Africa. That said, when the Portuguese arrived on the west coast of South Africa in the 15th century, they wouldn't have encountered these kingdoms, but rather hunter-gatherers and pastoral peoples. Indeed, the Portuguese traded with the Khoekhoe for supplies, though this ended badly when the Portuguese offended the Khoekhoe and were attacked. \n\nWhat this really shows, though, is what we consider to be history. For historians, there is obviously much more to history, and, as I wrote last time, it varies depending on the approach taken. For average laypeople, though, history relies on the written word and on archaeology, and when neither of those reveal anything, it's difficult to imagine that there was history in a place. This video, I suspect, is a perfect example of this view. It presents history as beginning with those who recorded it with written words. Before writing, according to the video, there is no history worth knowing. It would be one thing if it was just this video presenting this view, but it's a common one, and it's a dangerous one. It has an inherent judgement in it that written histories are superior. Anyway. That's my tangent.\n\nIf we did for some reason want to start history with the arrival of written history, wouldn't it make more sense to start with the first Europeans? Those aren't the Dutch, but rather the Portuguese. Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope (which he called the Cape of Storms) in 1488, becoming the first European to do so. He tried to trade with the Khoekhoe, but this ended badly. Vasco da Gama followed in 1497, trading and not getting along with the Khoekhoe. The Portuguese, however, elected not to settle in South Africa because of both the unfriendly natives and because of the hostile environment. They chose instead to go to Mozambique and establish a colony there to take advantage of the lucrative trade routes between Europe and India. However, Mossel Bay in South Africa did become a stop for Portuguese and later Dutch merchants and explorers bound for India, even though no permanent fort was established there. \n\nAll of this takes place before the video I linked claims history began. I'll now begin my critique of the video. It's just that one can't possibly discuss the history of South Africa without actually talking about the history of South Africa, which stretches to well before the arrival of Europeans.\n\n0:00 - This is the ~~intro to the game Mount and Blade~~ company movie for Paradox Interactive. It is not South African rock art.\n\n0:04 - The history of the Dutch in South Africa doesn't begin in 1652. In the early 1600s, the VOC (Dutch East India Company) had been using Table Bay as a stopover for their trading vessels. They would trade with the Khoekhoe for supplies before heading on to India or Holland, depending on the direction. They also explored other areas in the Table Bay area, dumping mutineers on Robben Island in 1648. The Cape region was useful as a stop, and potentially as a base against British trade to India. Bearing all this in mind, in 1651, the VOC commissioned Jan van Riebeeck to build an outpost at the Cape to resupply Dutch ships. This settlement was meant to include vegetable farms and a fort to protect the farmers from the Khoekhoe. By 1655, farmers had established some farms, but were still reliant on supplies from other colonies and from Holland to survive. The colony nearly starved in 1654, for instance, but was saved by supplies from Madagascar. Because of the near starvation of the colony and the need for it to be more efficient with land, the VOC commissioned some farmers to expand and settle in other areas. This, of course, led to further conflict with the Khoekhoe, and the first Khoi-Dutch War in 1659. The Dutch won. \n\nIndeed, Dutch expansion in the Cape was *so* efficient that the VOC was complaining about how the settlement was growing faster than they wanted it to. Their plan hadn't been to build a colony, but rather a resupply station for ships. Having a colony there was dangerous as it would attract attention from other colonial powers. It was also not something that the Dutch were prepared to defend, as the French attack in 1670 showed. However, by 1672, the VOC was more gung-ho about owning the Cape, claiming it had legally purchased it from the Khoekhoe in exchange for brandy, tobacco, and bread. This is unlikely. However, it didn't stop the colony from growing into a proper town, one which inevitably attract precisely the notice that the VOC didn't want.\n\n00:10 - So, I didn't realise how much was wrong with this video until I really started going through it. It makes telling a narrative like I usually do difficult. That said, I don't want to let anything go. This route, for instance, has ships going to Indonesia, not South Africa. In fact, I'm not sure they're stopping at South Africa at all, which seems rather unlikely, given that it was the halfway point and a great place to resupply before heading into the Indian Ocean.\n\n00:15 - van Riebeeck originally took three ships to the Cape, not an armada. That said, the Dutch did send Jan Pieterszoon Coen with 19 ships to take Jakarta, so I suppose it could be accurate. I only see 12 ships, though. \n\n00:21 - That is not the correct flag. The flag of the Cape colony was the [Dutch flag with the VOC logo in the centre.](http://www.loeser.us/flags/images/colonial/dutch/nl-voc2.gif) That flag is not the right flag.\n\n00:24 - The first houses in the Cape colony would not have looked like that. Instead, they were mud and stick buildings. Now, that said, estates started being built in the 1685, but once again, they wouldn't have looked like that. That is a building from the 18th century at the earliest. \n\n00:26 - Fun fact! The first South African wine was made by Jan van Riebeeck in 1659. It was a big hit in Europe, and spurred further investment in wineries in the Cape. The first wine estate was built in Constantia in 1685, and winemaking took off in the 18th century. However, the grapes in the video are not the grapes that Jan van Riebeeck would have used for his wine. van Riebeeck used muscat grapes which look like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Gelber_Muskateller_Weinsberg_20060908.jpg). Those are not muscat grapes. \n\n00:27 - There are a few things that happened between the growth of the Cape colony and its conquest by the British. In 1687, for instance, [French Huguenots](http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/first-large-group-french-huguenots-arrive-cape-0) started arriving en masse in the Cape, fleeing persecution. They were integrated into the colony, bringing with them their knowledge of winemaking. They also helped boost the population in the colony and ensured that the colonies' language laws mandating that people learn Dutch were put in place. They also helped stabilise the farmers outside the main colony by providing an incentive to maintain difficult farms. \n\nThis period also saw the first of a long series of wars between the Dutch and the Xhosa (also known as the [Frontier Wars](http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/conquest-eastern-cape-1779-1878)) as Dutch migrant farmers (trekboers) expanded into Xhosa territory.  These wars were caused by the Dutch seizing Xhosa land and cattle. In the first war, the Xhosa were ostensibly driven out of the territory around the Zuurveld. The second war, however, showed that this was not the case as by 1790, warfare among the Xhosa had sent some of the Xhosa back into the Zuurveld. These Xhosa didn't leave, and in 1793, the Dutch and the Xhosa made peace. Guess how long that lasted (I'll give you a hint - part of the Boers' strategy against the Xhosa was to wipe out all the adults and enslave all the children).\n\nIt's worth noting that during this time, the Cape colony was never particularly large. It's been estimated that just prior to its conquest by the British, there were a grand total of 15 000 Dutch people in the colony, plus their slaves. \n\nAnyway, in 1795, the British did indeed [capture the Cape colony](http://www.sahistory.org.za/cape-town/dutch-settlement) as part of the French Revolutionary Wars, though it relinquished control of the colony back to the Dutch in 1803. In 1806, however, the British once again seized the Cape as part of the Napoleonic Wars, this time not giving it back to the Dutch. The British imposed new laws and new regulations that were wildly unpopular with the Dutch, including freeing Dutch slaves. This caused unrest, and would eventually lead to things like the Great Trek.\n\nWhat's inaccurate about the video, then? Well, calling the 1795 British take-over of the colony an \"occupation\" is not *wholly* inaccurate, but failing to mention why or how the British came to be in possession of the Cape colony is deceptive. Failing to mention as well that the British actually took over the colony in 1806 is just bad history. \n\n00:38 - This is the wrong flag. The Union Jack wasn't used as the British flag until 1801. While it would have been flown when the British officially took over the colony in 1806, it was not in use in 1795. [This](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Union_flag_1606_%28Kings_Colors%29.svg) was the flag in 1795. \n\n00:40 - That's the [Castle of Good Hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_of_Good_Hope), a star-shaped fortress in Cape Town! It wasn't white. In 1795, it would have been bright freakin' yellow.\n\n00:45 - We have arrived in 1810, skipping over the actual take-over of the Cape colony and going straight to the good stuff. I find it a bit odd that the video chooses 1810 as the date at which \"the Zulu empire grows,\" especially considering the most well-known and powerful Zulu king, Shaka, took the throne in 1816. He gained control of the entire Zulu alliance in 1818. I have no idea where the 1810 date comes from, but if you know, please enlighten me. \n\nOver the course of Shaka's rule, the Zulu would expand into an empire along South Africa's east coast. They would drive out and destroy alliances and other Bantu groups that they encountered. These groups would eventually run into the Boers, and fuel the myth of an empty land and the myth that the native Africans had only recently arrived in South Africa. Part of this was due to Shaka's ability to centralise and consolidate power, as well as manipulate traditional Zulu beliefs into serving him. He also revolutionised Zulu warfare, changing it into something that other African groups had not encountered, and which even overpowered Europeans, as the later Battle of Isandhlwana would demonstrate. However, in 1828, he was assassinated after going crazy after the death of his mother. The Zulu  empire would falter, fighting losing battles against the Boers, but wouldn't fall until much later. \n\nNone of this is mentioned in the purported history of South Africa.\n\n1:03 - So there's nothing wrong with saying the Battle of Blood River was an important moment in South African history. It did, after all, represent the defeat of several thousand Zulu warriors by a force of a few hundred Boers. What's well worth mentioning, though, is why else it was important. Beyond just being an important battle, it also sparked a civil war in the Zulu nation that weakened it substantially prior to the Anglo-Zulu wars. It also led to the founding of the Natalia Republic, which the British swiped from the Boers because that's what the British do.\n\n1:21 - This battle appears to consist of Zulu warriors running helter skelter at the British, then getting shot a lot. This is terrible strategy, and not representative of how the Zulu actually fought battles. The Zulu were famous for a bull and horns type formation with which they would encircle and pin an enemy. The was especially effective at the [Battle of Isandhlwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Isandlwana) where the Zulu outflanked and outmanoeuvred the British, eventually defeating them. The Zulu weren't stupid. While Shaka had underestimated guns, they knew full well that they could be deadly, and took steps to prevent being annihilated by them. \n\n1:26 - I think one thing that really bothers me about this video is how little context there is for any of it. Take the First Boer War, for instance. What caused it? Well, I know that it was caused by Afrikaans nationalism, resentment against the British, and struggles for the diamond and mineral resources that had recently been discovered in South Africa. Does the video say or care about any of this? Nope. There was a war. The Boers were involved. It presumably sucked. I have to wonder how anyone is meant to learn something from this. Does it help me to know when the First Boer War was? Or does it help me more to know why it happened? Is the history of South Africa one of dates, or is it one of things causing more things?\n\n1:34 - The British abandoned using red coats in places like India and South Africa in the mid-19th century, [replacing those uniforms with khaki ones](http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/boer/canadianuniforms_e.shtml). (EDIT: This appears to be a matter of some debate, as the comments show. By the Boer War, certainly, they had khaki uniforms.)\n\n1:45 - Yeah! Like those uniforms! Those are the right uniforms! :D\n\n1:58 - Wait...what struggle? Is it the struggle for an Afrikaner nation? Because that kind of hit its peak with the Boer Wars. Some other things happened between the Second Boer War that tend to be important in South African history. These things include:\n\n- The founding of the Union of South Africa as a self-governing territory (1910). This also unified all the British holdings in South Africa into one collective group, the first time this had been done. \n- The founding of the African National Convention (ANC) as a response to disenfranchisement of black Africans (1912). The ANC initially protested the Land Acts which removed land from blacks and made no possibility for the land being returned, but then went on to serve as a representative for black Africans, not only in South Africa, but in a greater African context. It railed against colonialism, calling itself the \"Pan African Association\" by 1918. \n- The implementation of increasingly racist disenfranchisement laws, culminating in the implementation of Apartheid (1948)\n- The beginnings of forced removals of black Africans, starting with Sophiatown outside Johannesburg (1955)\n- The creation of Bantu \"homelands\" as places for black Africans to live (1959). This went hand-in-hand with stripping black Africans of their South African citizenships. \n\n2:05 - 1960 did see one struggle that springs to mind. In 1960, South Africa held a referendum about its independence. Independence was opposed by the British, but heavily favoured by the Afrikaners. None of this has anything to do with black protesters. \n\n2:18 - Have you noticed that the music went all triumphant when the video got to the Angolan Bush War? That's just kind of weird. The only people I know that celebrate that war are Afrikaner nationalists, and surely - *surely* - this isn't a video history of South Africa created by an Afrikaner nationalist. \n\nOther things that happened in 1966 - Namibia got fed up with South Africa and decided to declare independence. The UN agreed. South Africa did not. \n\n2:41 - Why did the music go all ominous? Why is \"new\" in quotation marks? \n\nThings that happened that are important in South African history between 1966 and 1990:\n\n- The Soweto Uprising (1976) where 176 students were massacred during a protest about Afrikaans education in schools. This is generally seen as a major event in the struggle against Apartheid, and one of the factors in the escalation of violence into the 1980s. \n\n- The Constitution of 1983, which re-enfranchised Indians and coloureds in South Africa\n\n- Boycotts of South Africa, causing its economic growth rate to plummet\n\n- Student protests against Apartheid\n\n2:48 - Stuff's in quotation marks again. I don't like it when things are in quotation marks and I don't understand why. \n\nThings that happened between 1990 and 1994:\n\n- The end of Apartheid\n\n2:53 - That's [Andries Treurnicht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andries_Treurnicht) speaking there. He was the head of the opposition to ending Apartheid, leading the No campaign during the Apartheid Referendum. What's he talking about?\n\n3:03 - Oh god, he's being racist, isn't he?\n\n3:09 - Why yes, yes he is. \n\n3:17 - ...this video was strange and unsettling. I shan't watch it again.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n[This](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/08/world/botha-rebuffs-de-klerk-over-vote-in-south-africa.html) is an article from the New York Times about the Apartheid Referendum. I really enjoyed it because it's from a time when no one knew what was going to happen in South Africa. \n\n[The history of the Dutch in South Africa](http://www.indyweek.com/sports/archives/2010/07/08/a-short-history-of-the-dutch-in-south-africa-1652-2010)\n\n[A really excellent article about the myth of the empty land](http://www.historytoday.com/shula-marks/south-africa-myth-empty-land). It's old, but it's still well-worth a read. \n\n[This article](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/180108?uid=3738392&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104697872341) about the Bantu expansions and how to piece together the history of them based on linguistic evidence\n\nEDIT: Oooo! Ooooo! Do you want to know my favourite thing about the video? The music in the background is called \"O Fortuna\" from the opera [Carmina Burana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmina_Burana_(Orff)) by Carl Orff. The words roughly translate as an ode to sex and asking lady luck for luck tonight. A close modern translation might be [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5EofwRzit0). It really has nothing to do with South African history.",

        "text": "So, I've just returned from the *Weihnachtsmarkt*, which always makes me pretty misanthropic (the *Glühwein* helps, but not much). So this puts me just in the right mood to write up a little bit on a TV-series I've watched over the past few days: 1864, the new big budget series by Danmarks Radio, the Danish public TV station responsible for such recent smash hits as 'The Killing' (Forbrydelsen), 'Borgen' or 'Broen'. Now, they apparently decided to tackle one of the lesser known chapters of history, the German-Danish war of 1864, known in Denmark as the 2nd Slesvig War. An affair, completely forgotten in Germany and Austria, overshadowed by the American Civil War taking place at the same time, and only recently brought back to public attention in Denmark by Tom Buk-Swienty's pop-history smash hit 'Slagtebænk Dybbøl' (Slaughterhause Dybbol) from 2008. Pretty neat book, by the way.\n\nI had heard a bit about this series being released, and since the History of Schleswig-Holstein and how we finally were freed from the evil Danish is a pet interest of mine, I figured why the hell not. Plus, this was going to be a recent big-budget production about a war where we actually won and were in the right, so I figured that would be nice for a change instead of watching Brad Pitt and Tom Hanks blowing up Tigers left and right. I mean, don't get me wrong, Band of Brothers and all that is nice and all, but essentially they're running around shooting my grandfather and his buddies, which makes it hard to emotionally connect on a level that Americans or Brits maybe can. And don't even get me started on \"Unsere Mütter, unsere Väter\". My doctor has told me to stay away from discussing that one. \n\nFor reasons of fairness, I should probably warn y'all that this is not going to be a minute-by-minute breakdown of all the badhistory in there, because it's a) really long  b) full of minor and major errors and c) I don't know that much about Danish internal history, so I will focus mainly on the military history, the engagements, units, leaders, uniforms and all that. I wish the makers of the series had done that as well. It will also be full of spoilers (if you're the kind of person who gets mad at being told that the Hitler dies at the end of *Downfall*, you're not going to enjoy this). \n\nFirst, some background on this obscure little war: The conflict started over the new Danish constitution, which integrated Schleswig into the Danish state. Schleswig, together with the Duchies Holstein and Lauenburg was under Danish control, but Holstein and Lauenburg were de jure part of the German Federation, and according to the London protocol of 1852 the Duchy of Schleswig was not allowed to be integrated further into the Danish state than Holstein and Lauenburg. Pressed by a faction of national-liberal Danes known as 'Eiderdanskerne', Eider Danish - the Eider river was the traditional border between German and Danish lands, running right through the middle of Schleswig-Holstein - on the one side and secessionist Holsteiners and Schleswigers on the other, Christian IX. signed a new constitution in November 1863 for the Kingdom of Denmark and the Duchy of Schleswig in hopes of keeping the Danish state together. \n\nThis was in essence a breach of the London Protocol and a convenient *casus belli* for Prussia. Accordingly, the German Federation imposed the Federal Execution over the Duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg, which de facto meant going to war with Denmark over Schleswig. German toops out of Saxony and Hannover occupied Holstein and Lauenburg against little resistance, and then in a series of small engagements, culminating in the storming of the Danish fortifications of Dybbøl/Düppeln, two corps from Prussia and Austria occupied first Schleswig and then the Jutland peninsula and the island of Als. This forced Denmark into peace talks, which ended with Denmark losing control over all three Duchies, Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg and some really bad nationalist hangover for the Danes. The whole thing is really quite a bit more complicated than that - Lord Palmerston is often quoted with the bonmot \"The Schleswig-Holstein question is so complicated, only three men in Europe have ever understood it. One was Prince Albert, who is dead. The second was a German professor who became mad. I am the third and I have forgotten all about it.\", which in this series he tells Queen Victoria while walking through Kent Gardens - but this is the tl;dr version for some necessary historic background so I can start my rant with a clean conscience. So on to the good stuff.\n\nThe good thing about this series is, that the badhistory starts even before the first episode. In [this trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL9nX3UTAeg) at 1:45, they claim it to have been \"the bloodiest war in Danish history\". This is wrong in any way you look at it. Total Danish casualties for the whole war are estimated at about 2.700 dead and wounded. Which makes it about the 5th or 6th bloody war in Danish history, depending on the sources. The Battle of Lutter am Barenberge during the Thirty Years War alone saw more than twice as many Danes dead and wounded on the battlefield than the whole 2nd Slesvig War. But that's just propaganda, and I don't want to judge the series by what the PR department wanted to sell. \n\nSo on to the story. Which starts boring from my viewpoint. Someone thinks it's wise to repeat the 'bloodiest battle in Danish history' claim, whatever. We get introduced to our two protagonists, sons of a farmer who was wounded during the 1st Slesvig War, Peter and Laust. Father's wound never heals, father dies, sons got reason for revenge on the Tyskerne. So far so good. A friend of the brothers also shows them his cumjar, they have a taste, #farmboylife. [I'm not even kidding. I hope I marked this NSFW.](http://i.imgur.com/xMj98Lb.jpg) Also, I really don't know what purpose this scene serves. That friend never appears again. There's some modern day sideplot about a young girl whose brother fell in Afghanistan who helps the son of the Baron of the place where the two boys lived in 150 years earlier rediscover the whole plot via the letters of Inge, the daughter of the Barons majordomo. Everything is told from these letters. So we meet Inge, she and the two boys like each other, they do childrens stuff. So far, so boring. Barons son was an Officer in the 1st Slesvig War, seems mentally unstable and obviously suffered psychic damage during the war. Baron slaps him for being a spineless coward. Barons son tries to get with Inge, which sets up the love Quadrangle (because both brothers love Inge, and only one knows that it's not platonic) that serves to give the series some completely unnecessary lovestory and more drama between the Danish soldiers. Because the two brothers of course end up in the Company led by the Barons son, who is also called up to serve again once the war starts. Meanwhile, the Barons son and his friends spend some quality time first raping a cow, then drunkenly beating a gypsy half-dead for poaching. The Barons son then rapes the gypsy's sister, so that leaves us all with little doubt about who the antagonist is. We've reached the second episode, and still no war. But the brothers grow up, Danish politicians fuck up by handing Bismarck the *casus belli* on a silver plate, Danish Army gets mobilised. [Moltke and Bismarck play with the toy soldiers of Bismarcks sons](http://i.imgur.com/bW6ABWN.jpg) - who seem a bit younger than they should be at that point, but I'll let that slide because that is honestly my favourite scene. I've left out a lot of stuff here, there's also a plotline following the national-liberal politicians in Copenhagen, led by Bishop Monrad, one following the gypsy-family's troubles, and some modern day stuff about the girl, her family and the Baron, but that's really boring so I'm not gonna bother. Plus it'd violate rule 2. \n\nOur heroes go through basic training, one of them shoots a cannon at a herd of pigs, and finally the war starts. Their Lieutanant informs our protagonists that they are now part of 1st Company, 9th Regiment, 8th Brigade (I like that they give that information away so freely, because it makes identifying all of the following badhistory that much easier). We also have a historic character thrown in for good measure, Sekondløjtnant (2nd Lt.) Wilhelm Dinesen (1845-1895), at 19 years one of the youngest danish officers of the war; though he looks a bit older - he's played by 35 year old Johannes Larsen. Dinesen would later go on to fight in the Franco-German War 70/71 and the Turco-Russian War of 77/78 and make a small name for himself publishing his hunting stories. \n\nWe are shown two Prussian officers on their way to treat with the Danish Supreme Commander, General Christian Julius de Meza, arriving at what subtitles call the [Prince's Palais in Schleswig](http://i.imgur.com/AsxHfwl.jpg) but which is definitely not the Palais in Schleswig because [this is what that one looks like](http://sr-architekten.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Fotolia_25359916_Subscription_Monthly_L.jpg). Instead, it's Libochovice Castle in the Czech Republic which is not even in the same architectural style and much too large besides. They meet de Meza behind a barricade of furniture, playing the grand piano, wearing a dressing gown and a Fez. Amazingly, this is not badhistory, but a testament to the eccentric character of de Meza, an otherwise brillant General who liked to play the piano and was afraid of drafts. [Here](http://imgur.com/zYPyXaP) is a period photograph of him.\nThe two men identify themselves to de Meza as \"Major Schell, 1. preußisches Dragonier(sic)-Regiment\" and \"Kapitän Striegel, Prinz Friedrich Karls Adjutantenkorps\"\nThere was no captain Striegel among Prince Friedrich Karls adjutants. There also is no \"1st Prussian Dragoons Regiment\". There was, at that time, the *1. Garde-Dragoner-Regiment \"Königin Victoria von Großbritannien\"* and the *Dragoner-Regiment \"Prinz Albrecht von Preußen\" (Litthauisches) Nr. 1*. I also think that the rank of 'Kapitän' (= captain, 'Hauptmann'), introduced in the Prussian Army in the 17th and 18th centuries, was no more in use at the time, but I'm not sure. Major von Stiehle is also missing some lametta around his epaulets, so someone might mistake him for a lieutenant. I think their collar also shouldn't be fully coloured before 1866, but I'm not 100% sure about that as well. Also, they're dressed a bit too light, but I'll get to that later. In reality, the two men were Major von Stiehle and Hauptmann von Gottberg, Litthauer Ulanen-Regiment 12, both from Field Marshal Wrangels General Staff. The encounter is shown in a very abridged form, the officers hand de Meza a letter by Wrangel, the Allied supreme commander, in which he asked the Danes to vacate the Duchy of Schleswig, with de Meza cooly, and seemingly undisturbed by the news, continuing to play the piano when asked for an answer, upon which the two Germans leave. In reality, both waited 6 hours while a visibly shocked de Meza (he had expected war in spring, and the Danes were yet unprepared) composed a letter in answer, refusing to accept Wrangels terms.  \n\nSo finally, the war has started. In the beginning of the 4th episode, we get a glimpse at the German forces: [A column of infantry marching up the road](http://i.imgur.com/t7oialB.jpg), apparently just having crossed the Eider. There are a few things to observe here. First, we have two units mixed together: A guards unit (I've circled in an example in yellow) and a line infantry unit (circled in red). The guards regiment here can be identified by the Gardelitzen - the two silver cords running along the collar, and the shoulderpads - the monogram identifies them closer as the 4th Guards Grenadier Regiment 'Queen Augusta' (*Königin Augusta Garde-Grenadier-Regiment Nr. 4*), hard to see here but it's clear in close-ups - though in that case, the shoulderpads should be light-blue instead of dark. This regiment indeed took part in the campaign as part of the combined Guards-Infantry-Division. I couldn't see the number of the other regiment, but their sleeve facings again point to line infantry. The troops are also not wearing the white armbands on their left arm which were used as identification device for the Allied forces. \n\nSecondly, and imho more importantly, they're dressed far too light. No greatcoats, no mitts, no shawls. When the Allied troops entered the Duchy of Schleswig across the Eider, temperatures were at -7° Celsius, with light snow. Also, only the officers seem to wear *Pickelhauben*. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/uYJ2btj.png) how Prussian soldiers (of IR 60) were dressed in the skirmish at Missunde, one day later. In fact, severe cold weather would prove to be one of the deciding factors for how the campaign played out: the freezing over of the Schlei river and the Treene-lowlands opened up the possibility for the Danevirke to be flanked both left and right. A nice touch is that they wear their trousers tucked into their boots, a practice that only started among Prussian troops during the 1864 war. Is it really that cliché for German soldiers to not have winter equipment?\n\nAnother point of note is that they seem to be crossing the Eider at a point where it is very wide. Either they're part of G.Gr.Rgt. 4, in which case they wouldn't have been among the first troops across the Eider, but would rather have later arrived by train in Rendsburg and crossed the Eider via the brigdes there, following the Austrians. In that case Prinz Friedrich Karl shouldn't be there, who is shown in a following shot, because he was at the front of the advance with the avant-garde of Hussars. Also, we should see some town around there, Rendsburg was an important fortress-town (abandoned by the Danes since they wouldn't defend Holstein or Lauenburg in force). Or they're part of part of one of the line infantry regiments crossing with the rest of Prussian advance troops further east. In which case the river is far too wide, because the Prussian Corps advanced across the [Eider canal bridges](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eider-Kanal#mediaviewer/File:Eiderkanalschleuse_2013a_03.jpg), the canal connecting Eider (which runs into the North Sea) and Baltic Sea. Which would have also made a nicer picture instead of this CGI river. \n\nIn the next scene, we get to meet the Allied supreme commander, Field Marshal von Wrangel and Prince Friedrich Karl, commander of Ist combined Corps, who at least [dress for the weather](http://i.imgur.com/Nvs47RI.jpg), even though the Prince refuses to wear his Pelz, probably because it looks more dashing that way. There's a little condescending banter between Wrangel and the Prince because of the Prince's youth and inexperiencedness (Wrangel was at the time probably the oldest living field commander in the world, a relic ofthe Napoleonic wars, but incredibly popular both among his soldiers and the populace and because of his anciennité and experience the only acceptable choice for command of combined Prussan-Austrian forces), with the Prince saying that he's glad for having his first Generals command. In fact, 36 years old, he had been a Major General since 1854, and commander of the III. Army Corps since 1860. Instead of the green noob commander as which he is shown here, he was a keen student of military science, and the III. Army Corps under his command became one of the most modern formations of the Army, realizing many of the Prince's reform ideas. He *was* known for being overly hesitant at times, though. Moreover, there was hardly anyone in the Prussian army at that time with war experience, the last real war being 50 years past. Wrangel was a living fossil.\n\nOur heroes' unit arrives at the Danevirke, the old fortification marking Denmarks southern border for almost 1000 years, and 2ndLt. Dinesen holds a nice speech full of nationalistic fervour (which is a nice touch, since the youngest Danish officers were reportedly the most motivated and optimistic). They also find no place to sleep, which is realistic since, while the Danevirke was scheduled to be manned by 50.000 soldiers for maximum effectiveness, there were only sheltered sleeping places for 2.000. The Danish government had spent too little money, and the fortifications were not in good repair. In any case, there were only 35.000 soldiers there, and thus too little to stop the German offensive for long, but resistance at the Danevirke was a political demand. 1/9th was stationed at Oberselk, in the central position south of the Danevirke, occupying an important position in the defensive line. However, once they have settled down, they are informed by General du Plat that the Prussians are on their way to Missunde. 2nd Lt. Dinesen volunteers to go there with his men, and gets approval by du Plat. Apart from the fact that General du Plat as commander of the Danish 2nd Division had no business at all being there (8. Brigade was part of the 3rd Division, Major-General Steinmann commanding), the Danish forces at Missunde didn't realize that they would be facing a major Prussian advance and didn't even call for their own reinforcements at first:\n\n&gt; It was not until much later, after the first Prussian artillery even tually be came involved, that Gerlach and Vogt finally realised that there was a major enemy force facing them. [Bismarcks First War, 49]\n\nFurthermore, 1/9th did occupy an important position and was involved in a defensive battle of its own, when the Austrian Brigade Gondrecourt attacked the Danish troops in the hilly area south of the Danevirke fortifications. Having just relieved 2/20th Regiment at the Danish left flank, they were pressed back by the Austrian attack, which succeeded to push back the Danes into the Danevirke and capturing the Königshügel, an important high point commanding the forefield of the Danish fortifications' left flank. This action doesn't appear in the series in any way. Probably because Austrians were involved - I should probably mention that at this point, there has been no mention of the Austrian involvement in the war. We've only seen Prussian troops, Prussian generals, Prussian politicians. No mention of the other German contingents involved as well. In the light of the importance of this war for the German question and the unification under Bismarck, this is a bit disappointing from a German point of view. Introducing the Austrians might make the viewers think 'wtf are the Mountain Germans doing there all of a sudden?' So that's all badhistory right there. Austria had 19200 man in the campaign, Prussia 29600, so while the Prussians were the majority, the Austrians still had a sizeable contingent - and according to Wrangels plan, made up a large part of the forces involved in the initial attacks and suffered higher losses than the Prussians. \n\nThe next scene shows us the prelude to the battle at Missunde from the German POV, we see the weapons left behind by the Danish troops fleeing in heavy fog before the Prussian avant-garde (the Zieten-Hussars and Infanterie-Rgt. 60), surveyed by an anxious and unsure General Prince Friedrich Karl, who is here shown to be badgered by FM Wrangel into giving the order to attack the entrenched Danes to be able to cross the Schlei at Missunde. In fact, Wrangel was not at the very front, and neither had he ordered to attack Missunde or forced Prince Friedrich to do so:\n\n&gt;Marshal Wrangel’s orders for February 2nd to Ist Corps were for an advance to\nthe neck of the Schwansen Peninsula, between Eckernförde and Holm. [Bismarcks First War, 47]\n\nMissunde lies further up the peninsula, at an important crossing-point of the Schlei fjord, but when Prince Friedrich Karl encountered no resistance, he decided to advance further towards this vital bridgehead. Friedrich indeed didn't want to attack at first, but not because of the fog or because he was a goddamned noob, but because Missunde was well defended, and he would rather cross further east at Arnis or Kappeln, which after the repulsed attack he did, outflanking the Danewerk and rendering it useless (now where did I hear something similar before...). Of course, nothing of that is mentioned in the series. Missunde is also shown as defended by makeshift barricades, instead of the fortified redoubts on both sides of the road that were there in reality.\n  \nAs for the battlefield, the Prussian attack came along the Eckernförde-Schleswig road, the Danish fortifications lying astride the narrowest point of the Missunde peninsula which is hardly 350m across at that point; and also across a frozen, narrow arm of the Schlei cutting into the peninsula southeast of the Danish fortifications. The road at that point runs alongside a lake through a forested valley. The whole affair was in effect also more of a reconnaisance in force, with none of the Prussian units reaching the redoubts, and certainly no massed infantry attack. Also, the battlefield was criss-crossed by *Knicks*, thick hedges that marked the edge of a field, a bit like the famous French *bocage*. The units were pulled back after it became clear that Prussian artillery had had little effect (probably due to low visibility) and an infantry attack was not promising success. Correspondingly, losses were light on both sides. [This](https://imgur.com/yXcA5Kd) is how it looks like in the series. The whole thing was mainly an artillery duel, with none of the Prussian forces actually attacking the redoubts en masse. Here, there are dead Prussians flying through the air *everwhere*. Prussian losses were light at 33 killed and 152 wounded, hardly the massacre depicted on screen. Our heroes from 8. Brigade survey the whole affair first shocked, then amazed, from a vantage point that would put them smack in the middle of the village of Missunde, of which we get to see nothing here. \n\nAfter the battle, we see wagon after wagon with piles of dead bodies driving past the Prince, who pukes in face of the casualties, underlining his supposed greenness. The many wagonsful of dead seems a bit excessive for 33 killed all in all, but I guess we need some dramatic effect here. The two Germans from Guards Grenadier Regiment Nr. 4 we got to know a bit closer earlier are also shown here, visibly distraught, muddy and bruised, despite the G.G.R. Nr. 4 not having taken part in the action at Missunde. Guess what, in the series it did. I couldn't identify the shoulderpads of the other soldiers shown pulling the carts about, but they look red which indicates a line-infantry regiment. That's all right.  \n\nWhat's funny is that, while both the 8th Brigade and the 4th Guards Grenadier Regiment shouldn't have been present at Missunde, they were in this series, while they both should have been present at the action around Jagel and Oberselk, which is not shown in this series. \n\nAnyway, de Meza recognizes that his position is untenable and vulnerable to flanking maneuvers and orders the retreat to Dybbøl/Düppeln further north, one of the three flanking fortifications prepared by the Danes to threaten an invaders flank in case of an invasion of Jutland. Which gets him sacked because of public outrage in Denmark over this retreat and sacrificing of the Duchy of Schleswig, for which the whole trouble started in the first place.\n\nThe two brothers get into a fight because one of them figured out that the other was boning Inge and even got her pregnant, and one of them volunteers for being the last of the last and spiking the Danish artillery that was left behind, something promising \"sure death\" (most danish soldiers weren't told that there would be a retreat until they were told to march north). The spiking of the cannons may have happened - initially, the cannons were scheduled to be taken by train back north to the railhead at Flensburg, but due to a misunderstanding that again shows the superiority of 24 hour-time, the cannons were not ready to be transported, because the artillery commander didn't know whether the trains would arrive at 8 AM or 8 PM. The trains went back to Flensburg empty, and 142 cannons fell into the enemy's hands. \n\nIn the following scene, Wrangel, is shown as a senile wreck, humming the Yorck'sche Marsch and [drumming his hands on the table together with the chief of Army Music, Piefke](http://i.imgur.com/Nf6zEDO.jpg), confusing danes and frenchmen, which leads to funny wordplays in both the Danish subtitles (*franskerne* vs. *danskerne*) as well as in the spoken German (hard to translate... *Dänen* sounds like German *denen* = whom). He seems to imagine himself again in the Napoleonic wars, telling everyone how to best defeat the French Emperor. He was a bit senile at that point, but not that much. Enter Moltke and Prinz Friedrich. Moltke is introduced as *Generalfeldmarschall*, a rank he didn't old until some years later - and in any case, he was in Berlin during that part of the campaign. Wrangel was indeed sacked, with Prinz Friedrich taking over command, but not until May 18th, many weeks later and almost a month after Düppeln fell. Moltke was Lieutenant-General at the time, and in fact would be subordinate to Prince Friedrich Karl as his Chief of Staff! Also, he was relieved because he couldn't keep up with coordinating the necessary large-scale operations, not because he failed to take the Danevirke immediately as is implied here.\n\nCut to the German troops in front of the Danevirke, who debate on whether to send a parliamentary back to the Danes to treat for an offered cease-fire. Prinz Friedrich Karl was not present, as he is here, but back in Headquarters together with Wrangel. The offer was indeed just a diversionary tactic, but again everything else is wrong. Beside Friedrich Karl, who never was there, the other troops shown are Prussians. It were in fact the Austrians, and an Austrian parliamentary who discoverd that the Danes had left. It was also and 1:00 in the night when this was discovered, not in the full light of day as shown here. Plus, they're again dressed much too light - it had cooled down to less than -10°C, and strong northerly gales were blowing. \n\nAnyway. The German parliamentary identifies himself to the empty fortifications as belonging to \"3rd Army, 6th Dragoons regiment, 5th Company\", in German with a thick accent (he also says \"Dragonen-Regiment\" instead of \"Dragoner-Regiment\" - couldn't they find one guy to spell that right, or at least consistently wrong - but I'm inclined to let that slide - Danes will hardly notice, and they're the audience). He probably means IIIrd Corps, the combined Guards Division, but  the 6th Dragoons-Regiment (Magdeburgisches Nr. 6) didn't take part in the campaign (it *did* take part in the following occupation), but at this point I'd be pretty surprised if they'd got any of the involved German units right, considering that they so far had no problem with the Danish ones, and the Ordre de Bataille is readily available in the standard books on the topic. Some of the staff officers and adjutants were from the 1st Guards Dragoons, but not Nr. 6. In any case, it was an Austrian parliamentary who first recognized that the ramparts were empty, but he was Austrian, so he's depicted as a Prussian. I think I can get behind their line of thinking now. They really shouldn't show this to any Austrians. \n\nSome modern-day sideplot rounds off that episode. \n\nSo now that the Dannewerk has been evacuated by the Danes, we follow their retreat in the 5th episode. For some reason, they are all running like hell, which is no way to conduct an orderly retreat - which, largely, it was - especially when you are tasked with forming the rear guard, as 8th Brigade was. They're also pulling a cannon with them, which is probably ahistorical (3rd Divisions artillery left with the 9th Brigade in the front, 8th Brigade brought up the rear) but probably an hommage to this [famous painting of the retreat](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/R%C3%BCckzug_aus_dem_Danewerk_5-6._Februar_1864.jpg), which is pretty neat. I think it refers to some episode at Sankelmark where the Danes of 7th Brigade saved a Cannon from falling into the enemy's hands.   \n\nThe Austrian Hussars are shown in hot pursuit, in a [scene](https://imgur.com/ezCcp95) recalling the riding of the Ringwraiths from Minas Morgul - which is fitting, because they're apparently led by [Colonel Gothmog](http://i.imgur.com/uO8XO9i.jpg). This series really lets you have no doubts about who the bad guys are. They Hussars of course find the small band of men from 1/9th, and after those fail to take out the small group of Hussars confronting them with their first volley, get captured by Gothmog and his merry band of Deaths Head Hussars who promptly [proceed to shoot their prisoners](https://imgur.com/ccwIwAs) to drive the point that these are ze evil djermanz past earth's molten core. Wait. Deaths Head Hussars? I thought I had said they were Austrian! \n\nSee, this is what really started it all, why I began writing this thing. The iconic Death's Head, which later rose to prominence as the emblem of the German Tank Corps (Panzertruppe) and led to some silly confusion (they were just slightly different from the SS-Totenkopf), was an emblem of two units of Prussian Hussars (and two Brunswickian Units, one Hussar, one Infantry). Not Austrian (notabene, the Austrian Pandurs of von der Trenck also had a Deaths Head, but that was more than a century earlier). But since Austrian=Prussian for the purpose of this series, hardly surprising. However: The prussian Deaths Head Hussars, the 1st and 2nd Leib-Husaren-Regiment were stationed at the prussian-russian Border during the war. There's also the Brunswickian 17th Hussars regiment, but they didn't take part in the campaign and their deaths head had a slightly different design. The only prussian Hussar regiment taking part in the war was, as part of the combined I. Corps in the combined Guards-Infantry-Division, the Leib-Garde-Husaren-Regiment (I can see where the confusion might have come from with that). Also taking part were 4 squadrons of the 3rd Hussar-Rgt. von Ziethen.\n\nSo, IF (that's a pretty big if) the Danes would have been captured by prussian Hussars, those would have been from the Leib-Garde-Husaren-Regiment. In which case they would be wearing the wrong uniforms - with the most glaring mistake being of course the enormous deaths head on the cap, which would have been a Guard's star instead [This](http://www.hussards-photos.com/Allemagne/Allemagne_LGH_CDV71866.JPG) is how a Hussar of the 1st Life-Guards-Hussar-Regiment would have looked in 1864, here on a postcard from 1866, the Pelz (the outer tunic) would also have been dark blue instead. [This is the uniform used in the film](https://imgur.com/XXQJqH5). They seem to be wearing some kind of fantasy-uniform that has no relation to Prussian or Austrian Hussar uniforms that I have seen. A Hussar's Attila of that time had five rows of woolen braid overlaid in parralel lines over the front of the tunic, each ending looped into rosettes - not running curved into the next row, as they do here. These uniforms for whatever reasons also have six rows of Schoitasches (the braidings across the breast) instead of five. The same goes for Austrian Hussar uniforms of the time period. It seems like a weird mix of older and newer styles. \n\nThe Austrian Hussars that took part of the campaign were the Husaren-Regiment Nr. 9 (later \"Graf Nádasdy\"). [This](http://www.hussards-photos.com/AutricheHongrie/Autriche_CDV_HR9_Kuss.jpg) is an officer of the sole Austrian Hussar-Regiment that took part in the war. Notice how how his uniform looks *nothing* like the one in the series? It also would have been dark-blue, not black and the baggy thing falling out of his Kutsma (the hat) would have been white instead of red - and there would be no Deaths Head on it; his sabretache would have been richly decorated instead of not at all and so on and so forth. \n\n[Here](http://www.grosser-generalstab.de/tafeln/knoe06/knoe06_19.html) is another picture of how Austrian Hussars looked 1862-65, and, *mutatis mutandis*, also the Hussars engaged with Danish troops during the retreat from the Danewerk.\n\nInterestingly, [Prinz Friedrich Karl is pictured in the Uniform of the Leib-Garde-Husaren-Regiment](https://imgur.com/2bewZYw), which took part in the campaign. Also his uniform is mostly correct, though the cords are silver instead of gold. His sabretache is also correct, with the F W R monogram on it. Unexplicably, they have the braidings on the Pelz wrong, again, despite doing them right on the Attila. [This](http://www.hussards-photos.com/Allemagne/Allemagne_LGH_CDV1Color.JPG) is how it's supposed to look like. It should also be blue instead of black, but maybe they only used black and white photos for designing them, I don't know. Furthermore, on his cap should be the Guards Star, instead of the metal band with \"Mit Gott für König und Vaterland\", but at this point I'm just glad they didn't give him a deaths head, too. The Guards Star is correctly shown on his saddle-coat, though, for some obscure reason. As a bonus for everyone having read this far, here's our darling [Willy looking absolutely dashing in the uniform of Leib-Garde-Husaren-Regiment](http://www.graphikfreund.de/pics/30/Wilhelm-Husar_R.jpg) and showing how it's done right. Yeah, I know it's not contemporary. I just wanted to post that picture.\n\nOne thing about Hussar uniforms is that they look all pretty much the same across units, differing only in color of the cloth and the ornaments. So it's not that hard to get it right. I mean you literally could do a google image search for 'Hussar Uniform', take the first example and you'd do a better job than whoever was in charge of designing the uniforms of the 'Austrian' Hussars. Interesting too is that dr.dk states in their episode description: \"After evacuation of the Dannewerk, the Austrian Hussars begin hunting the Danish troops\". Too bad none of those show up in the series. At least the guy who did the punchlines knew his history.\n\nSo, 2ndLt. Dinesen arrives to save the day, hacking of one Hussars arm before he can shoot one of the brothers, they kill all the Hussars (producing, all in all, twice as many casualties as the Austrian Hussars sustained in the pursuit) and are again on their merry way.\n\nAfter that, we come to the battle of Sankelmark (the location of the battle is better known as Oeversee in Germany), location of a bloody rearguard action ten kilometers south of Flensburg. The old Baron does a little exposition and tells us that \"the enemy was repulsed\" which allowed the Danish army to entrench at Dybbel, making it sound like a Danish victory. It was a tactical defeat leading to achievement of the strategic goal of ordered retreat. \"Almost 900 dead and wounded\" - the total number of Danish losses was 763 - 53 dead, 157 wounded and 513 captured; but this fits nicely with the general tone of \"Danmarks bloodiest defeat\" that permeates the series.The battle itself isn't shown, but that is probably for the better since the shots of the Danish troops and the battlefield before the engagement seem to be far off any resemblence to reality, making it look more like a Danish ambush.\n\nSo we miss the important and bloody battle that occured, a dramatic action with cavalry action, bayonet charges and a lot of twists and turns, and instead get to see the group of soldiers with the *other* brother marching through the woods because they seem to have lost their unit. Also, the snowstorm seems to have stopped, and there is little snow on the ground. They hear the screaming of the wounded, which is commented by their Corporal: \"Those are the wounded, they are left behind\". More on that later. \n\nThen we get an aerial shot of the aftermath and - come on, [are those Prussian uniforms again?](http://i.imgur.com/SFvOPrm.jpg) You've got to be... Yep, they're prussians. Notice the black-white-black Kokarde, and the cap he is wearing instead of a shako. And the Number 48 on the epaulets, meaning this would be a soldier of the 48th Infanterie-Regiment anD HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO LOOK UP ONE FUCKING NUMBER OF A UNIT WHICH WAS ACTUALLY THERE. The IR 48 took part in the campaign, but just as an occupational force in southern Schleswig-Holstein, taking part in the occupation of the island of Fehmarn far to the south and in the future of the action with which we are concerned here. Furthermore, IR 48 should have red shoulderpads and white sleeve facings. Instead, the troops involved in the engagement at Oeversee were the AUSTRIAN k.u.k. Jäger-Bataillon Nr. 9, the k.u.k Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 27 \"König der Belgier\", Nr. 14 \"Hessen\", the Liechtenstein Hussars (Nr. 9) and the aforementioned cannons of the 1st 4 pounder battery. [These](http://i.imgur.com/IYGadXK.png) are contemporary Austrian soldiers, most likely from the \"Belgier\" regiment. Notice how they look nothing like - I think I'm repeating myself here. \n\nThe German uniforms are largely all-right otherwise, with the caveat that the soldiers shown are again dressed much too lightly for the murderous temperatures (up to -26° Celsius in a snowstorm at the time of Sankelmark - that's -14,8 Fahrenheit.) [Here's](http://www.dhm.de/datenbank/img.php?img=mgr04682&amp;format=1) a table from Knötels Uniformenkunde, showing the heavy coats worn. What confuses me is that they get some obscure thing right, namely that Prussian soldiers began to wear their trousers tucked into their boots during that campaign. Probably pure chance.\n\n[I ran out of space. Cont'd below. Edited some typos.]",

The American public was pro Germany until Germany declared war on America, because of Japan.\n\n\nWhich is then answered by \n\n&gt;\"Japan started WW2.\" - you must be from Murica :-)\n\nThe thread then devolves into a melee of \"which culture is more violent\" and \"immigrants this, nationalists that\" and petrified forests of deleted bigotry and so on etc.\n\nBut this little nugget intrigued me because when you look it at it there has to be at least *some* bad history in these comments to be had, right? At least one of them has to be wrong!\n\nIs believing that Japan started WWII just some good ol 'Murican demagoguery?\n\nWell, let's see:\n\n&gt;When did World War II begin? \n\n&gt;Asking when World War II began is a good way to start a long and passionate debate. Some say it was simply a continuation of the First World War that had theoretically ended in 1918. Others point to 1931, when Japan seized Manchuria from China. Italy’s invasion and defeat of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in 1935, Adolf Hitler’s re-militarization of Germany’s Rhineland in 1936, the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), and Germany’s occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938 are sometimes cited. **The two dates most often mentioned as \"the beginning of World War II\" are July 7, 1937, when the \"Marco Polo Bridge Incident\" led to a prolonged war between Japan and China, and September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland, which led Britain and France to declare war on Hitler’s Nazi state in retaliation**. From the invasion of Poland until the war ended with Japan’s surrender in August 1945, multiple nations were at war with each other, some fighting for the ultimately victorious Allies, some for the Axis. \n\nSource: http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii#sthash.jldALhbF.dpuf\n\nInteresting, but then there's this take\n\n&gt;Who Started World War 2?\n\n  \n\n \n&gt;After his rise to power in 1933, Hitler led Germany on a mission of invasion and occupation. He had instilled into the country a desire for expansion in Europe, and in the years leading up to the Second World War, he expanded the army far beyond what was agreed in the Treaty of Versailles. This was the treaty which followed the end of the First World War – it caused Germany to undergo significant disarmament, and forbade the country from forming allegiances and invading other territories.\n\n&gt;The Treaty of Versailles included some terms which many Germans considered unduly harsh, and bred a feeling of resentment in the German population. The fiscal depressions of the 1920s and early 30s caused almost all European economies to collapse, meaning that Germany was unable to pay the extortionate reparation fees that had been set in the Treaty, and other countries – in particular, the USA – began to act with more lenience towards Germany. As such, when Hitler rose to power and formed an alliance with Austria, thought this was also banned in the Treaty of Versailles, many other countries decided to overlook it, given how extreme the terms had been in the first place. Hitler took advantage of this, and by the middle of 1939, had occupied much of what was then Czechoslovakia, and had set his sights on Poland. It was the invasion of Poland which caused Britain to take action and declare war.\n\n&gt;**It is almost indisputable that the actions of the Nazi party – the then leaders of Germany – were the cause of the outbreak of the Second World War, but one can certainly argue that other events laid the foundations for those actions to have gone ahead, such as the uncompromising approach of the Treaty of Versailles, and the turn-the-other-cheek attitude of other countries in the early 1930s**. If other countries had not been so lenient with Germany when, say, Hitler significantly expanded the army in 1935, then perhaps later events could have been avoided. The German population had immense confidence in Hitler – a charismatic leader who promised to right all the wrongs of the past twenty years. Had the USA, or Britain, or Russia, or France intervened at any earlier point, it is possible that Germany would not have been strong enough to hold off a foreign threat, and the confidence that German citizens had in the Hitler regime might have been diminished.\n\nSource: http://worldwar2.org.uk/started-world-war-2\n\nThen we have this declarative statement, using the term \"officially\":\n\n&gt;World War II officially began on September 1, 1939, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. \n\nThen a timeline that begins with\n\n&gt;World War II begins as the Germans invade Poland with a three-front Blitzkrieg. They attack the Polish army with an overwhelming force of 1.5 million troops backed by tactical aircraft in the sky and mobile armor on the ground.\n\n\nSource: http://history.howstuffworks.com/world-war-ii/start-world-war-21.htm\n\nI think we may have a winner. \n\nHere's probably the best evidence that Japan *entered into WW2* rather than started it:\n\n&gt;Japan entered World War II with limited aims and with the intention of fighting a limited war. Its principal objectives were to secure the resources of Southeast Asia and much of China and to establish a \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" under Japanese hegemony. In 1895 and in 1905 Japan had gained important objectives without completely defeating China or Russia and in 1941 Japan sought to achieve its hegemony over East Asia in similar fashion. The operational strategy the Japanese adopted to start war, however, doomed their hopes of limiting the conflict. Japan believed it necessary to destroy or neutralize American striking power in the Pacific the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor and the U.S. Far East Air Force in the Philippines before moving southward and eastward to occupy Malaya, the Netherlands Indies, the Philippines, Wake Island, Guam, the Gilbert Islands, Thailand, and Burma. Once in control of these areas, the Japanese intended to establish a defensive perimeter stretching from the Kurile Islands south through Wake, the Marianas, the Carolines, and the Marshalls and Gilberts to Rabaul on New Britain.\n\nSource: http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH/AMH-23.htm\n\n(I strongly recommend reading this article. Good stuff)\n\nSo even if they already were engaged in ongoing conflicts and had greater ambitions, Japan's acts of worldwide aggression (ie the bulk of their involvement in the war itself) did not take place until things had already escalated.\n\n**TL;DR**- So it looks like Hitler wins this one.\n\nInterestingly enough, I came across this while researching:\n\n\n&gt;Why did Japan start WWII?\n\n&gt;&gt;They didn't actually. Australia started WWII when they invaded Africa.\n\nSource: \"Chris\" at https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120208201020AAA0gtx\n\nNow I'm really fucking confused...",

For ore info, and a cracking good read, pick up C.J. Chiver’s ‘The Gun’\n\n&gt;Which implies that the cold war was inevitable without nuclear weapons, when given that Russia and the US are an entire continent apart, nothing was likely to happen. Likely we'd still have coldness between the two, but without the US taking risky moves in Europe (driven by 'we have the atom bomb and nobody else does) and developing the H bomb to piss off the Soviets, there's no strong evidence to suggest that it'd come to war.\n\n&gt;(As it happens, before WW1, war was considered a noble, heroic, and manly act.

It seems like even way back then, it was still the same.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/related/grrpm/leonardo_da_vinci_was_gay_in_fact_he_was/) It' just a swirling twister of every diseased idea that ever crawled out of any internet dwellers brain, malnourished and coughing. I have my fucking pick of comments here. Let's get started, then.\n\n&gt;[Most Renaissance artists were believed to be gay, or have gay affairs at least, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, ecetera... It's said that if Michelangelo had been straight, the Sistine Chapel would have been wallpapered](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/grrpm/leonardo_da_vinci_was_gay_in_fact_he_was/c1pt2g8)\n\n\nOh, please do go on, Maestro Vasari the 2nd, because your hypothesis is fascinating to me, especially since I'm home alone with a bottle of Captain Morgan, and I might just have a masochist complex. \nHold on, let me light a scented candle and break out the KY, since as long as we're going to be watching this TIL-ologist violate history, we might as well be comfortable with a hand free while we're doing it. \n\n\n&gt;Most Renaissance artists were believed to be gay, or have gay affairs at least, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, ecetera...\n\nJust because the only three Renaissance artists that this guy can remember are Michelangelo, Leonardo, and that Cara-whoever that showed up first on your google search terms for \"gay renaissance artists\" might have enjoyed men-- does not mean that \"most Renaissance artists were believed to be gay\". It doesn't even come close to meaning that.\n\nIf you want to split hairs, then it is certainly possible that many artists at the time were \"gay\" if you count being \"gay\" as having flings with men, romances with men, bromance with men or once writing vaguely erotic poetry about men. However, that still doesn't fly. See, \"most\" is a disingenuous term. There are a LOT of artists during the Italian Renaissance, and surprise, not as many mentions for desire of men as you'd think. Let's see here. Just off of the top of my head-- we have Bramante, architect, designer of St. Peter's Basilica that Michelangelo would go on to execute. No mention of him being gay. \n\nTitian, the man I believe to be most deserving of being the fifth teenage ninja turtle. Given that he had FOUR children, two sons, one daughter, and one daughter who died as an infant, and TWO wives, it seems like this 'gay renaissance artist' was dragged into heterosexuality kicking and screaming, wasn't he? How about... Raphael? I mean, with a name like that, how could you not be gay?\n\nOh, wait. \n\nVasari, the real one, famously claimed that Raphael was such a man-slut, that he had actually sexed himself to death on Good Friday-- \"after a night of excessive sex with his main chick Magherita Luti,  he fell into a fever and died when given the wrong cure.\" This being a fitting end to a 37-year life spending the first few years of his life reeling from being pooped out by a vagina, and spending the last half of his life desperately trying to get back in. \n\nNow, I could go on rambling into  50-page pdf about all of the artists that weren't gay-- or I could leave it at this:\n\nIf you want to be, I don't know-- correct-- then you'd be obliged to know that exactly zero artists  were gay, had gay affairs, or even have a concept of what the hell 'gay' is, since as has been eludiated many, many times in this sub, so many times such that the dead horse has been beaten, turned into glue and now haunts a third-grader's macaroni art project stuck to his mom's refrigerator, the identification of gay is a relatively new phenomenon; the term only really started getting traction within the last century or so, so your presentism of assigning the label \"gay\" to people hundreds of years in the past doesn't count for the shit on the toilet paper you wiped with. \n\nhey\n\nwait\n\n&gt;Most Renaissance artists were believed to be gay, or have gay affairs at least, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, ecetera...\n\nSon. \n\n&gt;... or have gay affairs at least, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, ecetera...\n\nOf. \n\n&gt;Caravaggio, ecetera...\n\nA. \n\n&gt;Caravaggio\n\nBitch. \n\nI remember where I've heard Caravaggio from. Does this asshole really mean Michelangelo Merisi Caravaggio-- as known as Amerighi? Sure, he quite possibly had an appreciation for the rougher sex-- And oh fuck this, seriously.\n\nHe's a BAROQUE ARTIST. \n\nBAROQUE: (1600 -&gt; 1700)\n\nalso known as NOT FUCKING RENAISSANCE\n\nTHE HIGH RENAISSANCE ENDED WITH THE DEATH OF RAPHAEL\n\nMANNERISM APPARENTLY DON'T REAL\n\nFUCK\n\n\n&gt;It's said that if \"Michelangelo had been straight, the Sistine Chapel would have been wallpaper\"\n\n\nThis guy doesn't seem to let the fact that a comedian said this quote stop him from repeating it unironically. And even if this is a joke, what exactly is the implication here? That if Michelangelo would have been a worse artist for the measure if he had been into chicks, not dicks? That (let's just pretend Michelangelo's whole fling with Vittoria doesn't exist here) it wasn't his hyper-obsession with sculpting that led him to become such a transcedent artist, it was the dicks, man, the dicks.\n\n\nJumping Jesus on a pogo stick. So TIL people can't be bothered to read more than 140 characters, apparently intending to consume literally all their media through either Tweets and Tweet-sized bites of info; spitting it right back out for other Tweetivores to consume no matter what kind of refuse it, where they too, in their reflection of their uninteresting personalities intend to repeat such refuse in a bid to make other people think them as interesting, god forbid original thought. Thus, we get bullshit like \"being ghey makes the sistyne chapel\" from a down on their luck comedian, some vapid-nobody steals the joke, treats it like the Word of God 2nd Edition, spreads it as far as wide as they possibly can and a million echoes follows.\n\n\n&gt;[Oh and the Mona Lisa may actually be a man](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/grrpm/leonardo_da_vinci_was_gay_in_fact_he_was/c1psift)\n\nOh, look, the OP rears his freakin' head.\n\n... this.... stupid.... I don't even want to find out what possessed anyone to conclude that the Mona Lisa was a portrait of a... man...\n\n&gt;Perhaps a self-portrait from his younger days\n\nor... of Da Vinci...\n\nOR ANYONE. OTHER. THAN. Lisa di Antonia Martia Gherardini, wife of Francesco de Giocondo, the woman who it was comissioned for, and the only person we have any real evidence to support the painting being about her, as opposed to active imaginations and the ghostly memories of concrete evidence.\n\nJust to make things perfectly clear. It's not fucking Leonardo Da Vinci, it's not fucking Salai. It's not fucking Verrocchio or the ghost of Botticelli or whoever the walk-the-Italian-states fuck anyone thinks it is. It's Lisa. Christ. I don't even want to guess where these bullshit alternate views came from. The last time I did, I found out that gynecologists and neurosurgeons apparently have more pull on the public's perception of ART than actual ART historians, meaning people now think Michelangelo painted a brain on a ceiling that one time, and I now have to study for a major that won't end up as a wall decoration like a BA's AH degree.\n\n\n&gt;Okay, but maybe (being gay) was just a phase! And then he started painting picures of women and immediately gave up his homosexual desire. That seems logical. This makes me feel more normal about fapping to the Mona Lisa while in the Louvre.\n\nI have no words. I'd let Captain Morgan do the talking but I find drooling on the keyboard doesn't translate to well to text on screen.\n\nuj\n\nSee? Nope. \n\n&gt;Leo was awesome, we could use more like him today\n&gt;&gt;He was a genius gay or not, nobody can debate that\n&gt;&gt;&gt;**I'd Debate it**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;**Does Autism count as Genius?**\n\n\nOh look, contrarian TIL-ologists in every direction.\n\nThis guy WOULD debate it because this guy wouldn't know his shit from his spit if gravity wasn't doing the hard work for him.\n\nSit down; shut up; Leonardo Da Vinci was a genius; The End.\n\n\n&gt;I've read it that it's ambiguous whether he was gay or not, and that in all likelihood he was celibate. It was common in Florence to accuse enemies of sodomy (it carried the death penalty) and it's possible this was one of those cases. It's worth nothing that only in the twentieth century did historians start to speculate that he was gay.\n\nThis is largely correct. The only issue I have with this statement is that the implication is that Leonardo was accused of sodomy, along with three other men, as an attempt to get him executed. First off, if he was to be seriously accused, he would have had to have been accused with a signature; the original accusation was unsigned, and therefore considered invalid. Second off, even if he was to be seriously accused, he would definitely been given multiple chances to recant, pray the gay away, whatever. Especially in light of his talents. I mean, hell. Florence was known to be gay. Like, super gay. It was at least, I don't know the world's second biggest homo-hub.  If they executed every dude who banged another dude in the halls of the buildings of Florence, there would be no one left in Florence, and the Germans would have no one to mock for being as effeminite as a 'Florenzer'. \n\nCase in point, Leonardo was not accused of sodomy to get him executed, and definitely not in a place as semen-soaked as Florence was. Someone dropped an anonymous tip into the accusation box most likely as a Renaissance-era form of fucking with him. It was not a good way of getting people convicted; it was an excellent way of defaming and just screwing with whatever miserable jagoff you felt deserved it. \n\n\nOf course,  in reply the OP swings in with more tweet-level nuggets of genius.\n\n\n&gt;I've read it that it's ambiguous whether he was gay or not, and that in all likelihood he was celibate. It was common in Florence to accuse enemies of sodomy (it carried the death penalty) and it's possible this was one of those cases. It's worth nothing that only in the twentieth century did historians start to speculate that he was gay.\n&gt;&gt;Well he did live with an openly gay assistant for 20-years.... Just saying\n\n\nYeah, sure. Let's just ignore years and years of scholarship and debate on Leonardo Da Vinci's sexuality, and the section of his personal diary where he goes on to call sex \"The act of procreation and anything that has relation to it is so disgusting that human beings would soon die out if there was no pretty faces and sensous dispositions.\" because Salai had cartoons of his bum being chased by penises with feet, so that settles that.\n\n**Tl;DR oh my gawd that bitch Leonardo was not even gay. He was such. A poser.**\n\n\n\nSource: assorted drunken snippets from Gardener's Art Through The Ages second edition.",

        "author": "smileyman",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2njiix/the_real_story_of_thanksgiving/",
        "text": "Since Thanksgiving is tomorrow, I thought I'd discuss all the bad history that gets thrown about when talking about the history of the Thanksgiving holiday as practiced in the United States.\n\n[This](http://www.manataka.org/page269.html) site has a pretty typical explanation of the supposed *real* history of Thanksgiving, linking it to the [Pequot War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pequot_War#The_Mystic_massacre) and the Mystic massacre.\n\nDuring the Pequot War of 1637 and 1638 there were numerous atrocities committed against the the native peoples. Perhaps the most egregious of these was the Mystic massacre on May 26, 1637, when colonists attacked the village of Misistuck. Most of the warriors of the village were involved in raiding English settlements, so the place was inhabited by mostly women and children. As many as six or seven hundred non-combatants were killed in this attack. \n\nAt the conclusion of the war William Bradford (the governor of Plymouth colony) called for a day of thanksgiving in recognition of the victory.\n\nThis is often cited as the first Thanksgiving and the source of the modern holiday.\n\nHowever, there are several problems with this. The first major issue is the time of the holiday. If we held Thanksgiving holiday in the spring, rather than the fall of each year, then perhaps this could be the original source of the holiday. However, Thanksgiving *isn't* celebrated in the spring, but in November. \n\nNor was this \"day of thanksgiving\" formalized as a holiday. It was a one time event to celebrate a military victory, and such one time \"days of thanksgiving\" were fairly common. \n\nBut beyond all that, this wasn't even the first \"day of thanksgiving\" held in the colonies.\n\nIn Plymouth there *was* a fall feast held in 1621, and we have records of it from participants. \n\nIn 1623 Plymouth held *another* fall feast after a particularly good harvest had come despite an earlier drought. \n\nAccording to the proprietor's directions for the Berkeley Hundred colony, the day the ship landed was to be [\". . . yearly and perpetually kept as a day of thanksgiving\"](http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/jamestown-and-plymouth-compare-and-contrast.htm). The ship arrived on December 4, 1619, which is still closer to the date at which the modern Thanksgiving than is a May celebration. \n\nThere were even more days of thanksgiving held. According to David Hackett Fischer in *Albion's Seed*, there were 22 days of thanksgiving held in the first half century of the Bay colony's existence. To quote him further:\n\n&gt;“If daily and weekly movements were unusually strong in New England, other common rhythms were exceptionally weak or even absent altogether. The Puritans made a point of abolishing the calendar of Christian feasts and saints' days. The celebration of Christmas was forbidden in Massachusetts on pain of a five-shilling fine. In England, the Puritan Parliament prohibited the observance of Christmas, Easter, Whitsunday, saints' days and holy days.” \n\n&gt;“A fourth Puritan festival was Thanksgiving, which by 1676 had became an annual event, held on a Thursday in November or December. In earlier years, days of Thanksgiving were appointed ad hoc for special occasions by civil authorities. The first Thanksgiving in the Bay Colony happened on 22 February 1630/31, after provision ships arrived just in time to prevent starvation. \n\n&gt;Approximately twenty-two special days of Thanksgiving were held in the first half-century of the Bay Colony. After New England survived King Philip's War, Thanksgivings began to occur regularly in November. The appointed day was Thursday, which had been lecture day in the churches of Boston and Ipswich. Special days of Thanksgiving continued, but by the late 1670s this event had become an autumn ritual, in which a fast was followed by a family dinner and another fast. The main event was a sermon which reminded New Englanders of their founding purposes.” \n\nThen in 1863 Abraham Lincoln called for another day of Thanksgiving in a document written by Seward, part of which states:\n\n&gt;It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and voice by the whole American people. I do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the **last Thursday of November next**, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens. And I recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to his tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty Hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the Divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquility and Union.\n\n*This* is the origin of the modern day of Thanksgiving, and the traditions of fall celebration and feasting go back well before the Pequot War.

Anglo-Saxon cniht had no particular connection to horsemanship, referring to any servant. A rādcniht (meaning \"riding-servant\") was a servant delivering messages or patrolling coastlines on horseback.

        "text": "Alright, so I know that finding bad history in /r/Anarcho_Capitalism is like shooting fish in a barrel. But recently, I made a post in /r/AskHistorians responding to [this question](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2n9qve/did_native_americans_make_roads/) which was cross-posted in a number of subs. I'm honestly rather surprised it gathered that much attention, but apparently people found the topic interesting. Among various places, the thread was reposted in AnCap. Road systems are one of these inside jokes that AnCap has about \"statists,\" so a post on Native American road systems must, by transitive property, be *hillarious*. Among the chatter we get [this gem](http://np.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/2nb5yg/le_derp_asks_raskhistorians_if_native_americans/cmc334l), where the author appears to be equating Andean \"socialism\" to modern socialism. He equates the Inca empire to a modern welfare state, and describes their conquest by the Spanish empire as an act of liberation. Because he wrote this in response to one of my posts, I felt like I needed to respond to it. But I didn't want to post in the AnCap sub, so I figured I should just post it here where I can be smug and ridicule it from the safety of my armchair. So here we go:\n\n&gt;The Iroquois nation, of which I'm a minor descendant,\n\nRead: My great-great grandma was 1/4 Oneida so that makes me an expert.\n\n&gt; was a confederation of tribes trying to build a power block to resist western encroachment.\nThey had some very interesting ideas which were influential on the Founders of the US and found their way into some doctrines. They said that each man was a nation to himself, a sovereign. Frankly they sounded way ahead of their time, like the most radical decentralized-law advocate. If they'd discovered rationalism and technology before the West, things today might be far more different. Imagine an enlightened red nation ruling the Americas, a confederation of individuals tied together only by mutual contract, complex interactive structures built on top of an anarchic whole.\n\nThis is, of course, a highly inaccurate and gross oversimplification of the politics of the Iroquois confederacy. Someone more knowledgeable than me about Iroquois government could probably shred this apart. But I'm going to focus on the second part of his post.\n\n&gt;You could also look at the Inca, who did in fact make huge networks of very impressive roads, though they achieved it through amazingly repressive tyranny that stripped the populace of the ability and emotional qualities needed to make decisions for themselves, resulting in extremely poor adaptation to the freer conditions brought on by Spanish rule--the Spaniards were bastards already but at least they'd let you choose your occupation and your wife and where to live!\n\nYeah, because burnings at the stake and de-facto slave labor are hallmarks of a freer society.\n\nYes, the Inca empire practiced forced relocation, yes they drafted commoners into forced labor for the state, but the Spanish were not really any different. In fact, during the Early Colonial period they explicitly copied the Inca method for administration of their provinces. The Spanish empire did not really give their indigenous subjects a choice on what occupations they could hold or where to live. On the latter point, the Spanish found it difficult to administer their South American holdings because of how dispersed the population was, especially given the gradual depopulation of concentrated urban centers due to smallpox and whatnot. So they implemented a policy called *reducciones*, where they essentially forcibly relocated people in small villages/hamlets to urban centers for easier administration. Entire communities were uprooted from their lands, which they had worked for generations, and moved to settlements so they could be more easily organized. This is heads and shoulders above anything the Inca did regarding forced migrations: it affected pretty much the entire continent. Additionally, the forced labor system (known as the *mita* system) that the Inca used was immediately adopted by the Spanish for administration of their colonial holdings. Only instead of having one member of each family spend a few months working fields owned by the state, they would force people to work for years in brutal conditions in silver mines at places like Potosí. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, died in these mines churning out precious metals for export to European countries. I'd hardly call that freedom of occupation. \n\n&gt;It's sad that the Inca population were, in places, denied even these basic decisions for so long that their society broke down considerably when it didn't have daddy-government to either tell it what to do or bail it out when it got in trouble anymore.\n\n*Sigh.* Where do I begin?\n\nThe Andean economy was admittedly very different from our own economy. If one had to draw an analogy between the Andean economic system and any modern one, the closest analog would be socialism. But, **Andean socialism != Modern socialism**. Andean communities were typically organized around extended family units called *ayllus*. Each ayllu would establish colonies in different regions, and each branch of the ayllu would be involved in the production/acquisition of a different resource. Through reciprocal gift exchange, the different branches of the ayllu would supply each other with commodities that they could not receive from local resources. So for example, a branch of the ayllu in the high mountains would herd llamas and supply their kinsmen in the valleys with wool, who in turn would supply their kin the mountains with agricultural products like corn or potatoes. This is only \"socialism\" in the sense that the resources were owned by a collective, but the collective was a family. There was no market system of exchange, but that's hardly makes an ayllu the same as a modern socialist commune. \n\nIf commoners in an ayllu exchanged resources through reciprocal exchange, the nobility, known locally as *kurakas*, achieved power through aciprocal exchange. The kurakas were given gifts by their subjects, and in turn they gave gifts to them, but the exchange was unequal. The people gave more to the nobles than they got from them, but the entire system was phrased in terms of gift exchange. The Inca empire effectively expanded this process by engaging in aciprocal exchange with the kurakas. They established certain quotas for how much labor each community owed to the state, and the kurakas were expected to organize labor for this purpose. In return, the Inca provided gifts and feasts for the kuraka, reinforcing his social status in relation to the rest of the ayllu. Again, the exchange was phrased in terms of mutual reciprocity, although obviously the Inca were getting more out of it than the locals.\n\nHow does this differ from the strawman of socialism that Anarcho-Capitalists love to knock down? Well for one, the Inca weren't doing this for the welfare of their subjects. There weren't Inca food stamps or welfare assistance programs that \"bailed them out\" when their \"social system broke down.\" The Inca, like many ancient states, saw themselves as intermediaries between common people and the divine world. They consciously appropriated indigenous sacred sites, transforming them into *Inca* sacred sites that they administered. To the Inca cosmology, all of the sacred shrines in the Andes were part of a network of ley lines called \"wakas,\" which converged on the Inca capital of Cuzco. Once they appropriated these sacred centers, commoners had to go through them in order to venerate their ancestors. So in addition to the ethic of reiprocity, the labor owed by commoners to the state was in part justified as maintaining the sacred order. This is not the same as a modern socialist ideology, which sees service to the state as service to the welfare of the working class. The Inca nobility couldn't give two shits about the working class, and they certainly weren't providing welfare programs that supported them. The analogy of \"daddy-government\" is totally inappropriate.\n\n&gt;The Incas taxed in the form of labor, so this would've been part of that. And they taxed about as heavily as the US today does, like 20%! Skilled labor was taxed in the produce of their skill, and non-skilled labor was used two months out of the year to either help build things, digging ditches and putting in roads, or else in the armies of the Inca.\n\nIt's important to note that this was the *only* tax the Inca exacted. There was no monetary tax at all. One member of your household would spend (on average) two months a year working for the government. This can be either in the form of agricultural labor, service in the army, or some other equivalent. Anything you produced on your own land was owned by your (extended) family, and the Inca wouldn't touch it. If anything, you would think this would be a system that AnCaps would see as favorable to the modern tax system. There were of course exceptions to this. Sometimes a person would be drafted into full-time service - in particular young women were taken for spiritual service in an institution roughly comparable to nunnery. There was also a policy of forcibly relocating people in order to break up troublesome ethnic groups. And of course, there's the occasional child sacrifice to the mountain spirits (something that /u/Qhapaqocha could probably talk about at length). But aside from that, the Inca weren't the tyrannical despots he portrays here. They were violent, coercive, and exacted tribute from their subjects, but they weren't really any worse than any other empire in history. And all of this pales in comparison to what the Spanish did once they took over.\n\n&gt;I read a whole book on them, fascinating creatures, one of the prime examples of original socialism as a social system.\n\nGood for you. You should read *more* books on them, since you clearly didn't understand the first one.\n\nMay I suggest *Huarochiri: An Andean Society Under Inca and Spanish Rule* by Karen Spalding? That book looks at a single Andean ayllu and its relative fortunes under both Inca and Spanish administration, and gives a good example of the different imperial strategies they used and their impacts on local Andean people.",

        "text": "Source:http://imgur.com/yUQNC8W from a Pakistani atheist page.\n\nThe particular part I am dealing with is:The people of the Indus can be reborn into what they have always been.\n\nOn the religious practices of the Indus Valley civilization(quoting Wikipedia here):\n\n&gt;The religion and belief system of the Indus valley people have received considerable attention, especially from the view of identifying precursors to deities and religious practices of Indian religions that later developed in the area. However due to the sparsity of evidence, which is open to varying interpretations, and the fact that the Indus script remains undeciphered, the conclusions are partly speculative and largely based on a retrospective view from a much later Hindu perspective.An early and influential work in the area that set the trend for Hindu interpretations of archaeological evidence from the Harrapan sites was that of John Marshall, who in 1931 identified the following as prominent features of the Indus religion: a Great Male God and a Mother Goddess; deification or veneration of animals and plants; symbolic representation of the phallus (linga) and vulva (yoni); and, use of baths and water in religious practice.\n\n&gt;One Indus valley seal shows a seated, possibly ithyphallic and tricephalic, figure with a horned headdress, surrounded by animals. Marshall identified the figure as an early form of the Hindu god Shiva (or Rudra), who is associated with asceticism, yoga, and linga; regarded as a lord of animals; and often depicted as having three heads. The seal has hence come to be known as the Pashupati Seal, after Pashupati (lord of the beasts), an epithet of Shiva. While Marshall's work has earned some support, many critics and even supporters have raised several objections. Doris Srinivasan has argued that the figure does not have three faces, or yogic posture, and that in Vedic literature Rudra was not a protector of wild animals. Herbert Sullivan and Alf Hiltebeitel also rejected Marshall's conclusions, with the former claiming that the figure was female, while the latter associated the figure with Mahisha, the Buffalo God and the surrounding animals with vahanas (vehicles) of deities for the four cardinal directions.Writing in 2002, Gregory L. Possehl concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognize the figure as a deity, its association with the water buffalo, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would be going too far.[74] Despite the criticisms of Marshall's association of the seal with a proto-Shiva icon, it has been interpreted by Jains and Buddhists as representing an early Tirthankara or an early Buddha.\n\n&gt;Marshall hypothesized the existence of a cult of Mother Goddess worship based upon excavation of several female figurines, and thought that this was a precursor of the Hindu sect of Shaktism. However the function of the female figurines in the life of Indus Valley people remains unclear, and Possehl does not regard the evidence for Marshall's hypothesis to be \"terribly robust\". Some of the baetyls interpreted by Marshall to be sacred phallic representations are now thought to have been used as pestles or game counters instead, while the ring stones that were thought to symbolize yoni were determined to be architectural features used to stand pillars, although the possibility of their religious symbolism cannot be eliminated.\n\n**TLDR:A few religious practices of the Indus Valley Civlization might have made their way into tradtions of early Indic religion,but we are not *that* sure about the details**\n\n\n\nThe rest of his post is worthy of /r/badsocialscience .",

Cracked is obviously not well loved on here, and for good reason. For that reason, I feel you should all see this, so you can never go there again, and be properly pissed off. Because, holy shit. This is amazing. \n\nAnyways, Cracked has a podcast, usually it's at least mildly entertaining. Much like most of their stuff you take it with a grain of salt at most, but it's at least OK. Some of the guys (Michael Swaim) I really like. However, the beginning (and much of the rest that I won't even start with) of the most recent podcast is... Terrifyingly awkward and bad. I'm going to cover the 1:35 to the 6:00 mark. The podcast can be found here: http://www.earwolf.com/episode/how-a-dating-site-proved-society-is-doomed/\n\nI will attempt to do this in the way I see others doing it to the very best of my ability! Here goes:\n\n&gt; 1:35: For the first big chunk of the existence of our species we didn't write anything down, evolution just sort of spit us out on some plane in Africa, about 200,000 years ago. Same brains and bodies as we have today, and we spent the first 194,000 of those years nobody thinking to write anything down, I'm sure they were very busy clamoring up the food chain, and abject terror, and trying to learn not to have sex with their family members.\n\nThis is more r/badbiology or r/badevolution so I won't really go into it, but needless to say that's not how evolution works. I'm pretty sure that basically every word in that sentence is wrong. We certainly didn't need to spend 197,000 years learning not to have sex with family members. While I'm sure there was a great deal more inbreeding in humans a long, long time ago, animals have a natural disposition towards outcrossing. Granted it's wikipedia, but:\n\n&gt; Inbreeding results in homozygosity, which can increase the chances of offspring being affected by recessive or deleterious traits.[2] This generally leads to a decreased biological fitness of a population[3][4] (called inbreeding depression), which is its ability to survive and reproduce.\n\nI'm pretty sure that you don't just have to learn not to fuck your family. Moving on to where the bad, well, pretty much everything:\n\n&gt; 2:10: For the past 5000 years, we've had the written record, history. Yaaaay. (/s I think.) It's better than nothing, for sure, but it's not great. The winners, a bit overrated as eyewitnesses go.\n\nYay! As we all know, Victor has written all of history! You are all very well versed in this fact, so I'll leave it to u/Tiako to explain it better than I ever could:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1sc1ro/for_the_sake_of_easy_repudiation_what_are_the/cdw0om8\n\nNow that we're through the appetizer, here's the main course.\n\n&gt; 2:25: And historians haven't always been the swiftest members of society I would argue. Or have not, ever been that, I guess. You don't send your best and brightest to go pour through some dead guy's pocket litter.\n\nHoly. Fucking. Shit. I mean, I don't think that there's a way I can provide an academic article proving that this is wrong, but I will say the following: Karl Marx, Thomas Hobbes, Voltaire. And, just in case a major STEM name is 100% required: Fucking Eratosthenes. \n\nHow about this: Historians are the people who ran the fucking Library of Alexandria. And if I know anything about that place, everyone in the STEM field believes it to be the hub of all knowledge, and that we'd already have people living on Pluto were it not for those mean ol' meanies burning it down. \n\nIf anyone can provide something that would actually address this directly that would be wonderful. But it's such a bizarre thing to even say, I can't imagine it's needed to be debunked academically!\n\n&gt; 2:40: Quick example of what I mean about the fallibility of history: Samurai! You have a picture in your head of what the samurai looks like in your mind that consists of sort of an ancient code of loyalty to their master, and magical swords that can cut a horse clean in half. Or whatever the fashionable thing for ancient samurai to cut in half was. Women unmarried after age 20 or something? And historians came up with that image of samurai that we all have, using a list of rules about how a samurai should act that was created by their masters. And those rules emphasize things like loyalty and honor and sword sharpening I guess. \n\nSo my first thought when he started talking, immediately when he said samurai was: THAT IS POP CULTURE YOU FUCKING MORON! \n\nSo the R5 for this portion:\n\nWe can take a look here: https://webspace.yale.edu/anth254/restricted/Bolitho_1984_in-Rix_Mouer.pdf\n\nHarold Bolitho does a great job summarizing exactly why this is awful history in the first couple of pages.\n\n&gt; The Samurai, as he is revealed in Japanese history, was very, very different from the myth. What was he like? Well, the short answer would be that he changed very much over time. He was, after all, in existence in Japan for the better part of a thousand years, and it can hardly be expected that he would be able to remain aloof from developments around him. ... It is virtually impossible to find a plausible formula to cover all samurai at any given time, let alone across a millennium of change.\n\nBut yeah, sure, Historians had no clue what the hell a samurai was, so they just made shit up. They've never done any digging, and have never attempted to expel many of the silly myths associated with samurai. This was written in 1984, by the way. So it's not like it hasn't been known to be this way for a very long time. Wikipedia also has a section about the samurai myth which can take us back to some research into the samurai back in 1905, \n\n&gt; \"Most samurai were bound by a code of honor and were expected to set an example for those below them. A notable part of their code is seppuku (切腹 seppuku?) or hara kiri, which allowed a disgraced samurai to regain his honor by passing into death, where samurai were still beholden to social rules. Whilst there are many romanticized characterizations of samurai behavior such as the writing of Bushido (武士道 Bushidō?) in 1905, studies of Kobudo and traditional Budō indicate that the samurai were as practical on the battlefield as were any other warrior.\n\n&gt; Despite the rampant romanticism of the 20th century, samurai could be disloyal and treacherous (e.g., Akechi Mitsuhide), cowardly, brave, or overly loyal (e.g., Kusunoki Masashige). Samurai were usually loyal to their immediate superiors, who in turn allied themselves with higher lords. These loyalties to the higher lords often shifted; for example, the high lords allied under Toyotomi Hideyoshi (豊臣秀吉) were served by loyal samurai, but the feudal lords under them could shift their support to Tokugawa, taking their samurai with them. There were, however, also notable instances where samurai would be disloyal to their lord or daimyo, when loyalty to the emperor was seen to have supremacy\"\n\nI mean, I know jack all about the realities of Samurai, but know intuitively it is not professional historians that have created the ridiculous image of them that people picture when they think of samurai. I mean, come the hell on. Further, he doesn't even give ANY evidence as to this supposed \"list of rules\" that historians seemingly made up to create the image of samurai. What the hell list is he talking about? So however does he justify such a ridiculous thing?\n\n&gt; 3:30: Let's look at the logic those historians were using back then (YOU HAVEN'T TOLD US WHAT THIS LOGIC IS OR WHAT THEY USED! I am assuming he means Bushido, but he never says it, and that's hardly the only thing anyone's ever used to define a damn samurai), and apply it to another group. Let's say high school students. Let's come up with a few assumptions based on the list of rules the student handbook that teachers distribute at the beginning of the year that stoners roll joints out of. (No they wouldn't. That wouldn't burn well enough at best, and would waste their weed at worst). \n\nHe goes on to talk about the picture of high school students you'd have in your head if you based it on the student handbook. As if historians just saw THE SAMURAI MANUAL and went, \"Oh, OK. So they all acted in exactly this way all the time. Cool. No further research necessary.\" That's ridiculous. There are so many things that have been looked at, including, you know, primary sources. He says, \"rules don't tell us how people behave, just how we want them to behave\". As if historians, people who STUDY HISTORY AND PEOPLE AND MURDER are not aware that everyone doesn't follow all the rules. Can he honestly believe he's that much smarter than like, every historian ever? \n\nAll right, here is my favorite part:\n\n&gt; 4:20: Now the truth about Samurai, according to documents that weren't that list of rules, portray them as less than fiercely loyal and more like modern pro athletes, always ditching their master for another master that paid them better money, and you know how Alex Rodriguez didn't kill himself for bringing shame on the Yankees organization for the steroid scandal? That's how much samurai killed themselves after they shamed their master. And the athlete metaphor is actually apt, if I may call a metaphor I made \"apt\" and I'm giving myself douche chills here at the outset of this podcast (and everyone else). Because the reason those masters were all competing to pay them all that money is because they were expert archers on horseback. Which is the thing that was so hard when it came time to make movies about Samurai directors were like \"awwwww, ok, what if they got around on foot like everyone else and used swords like everyone else...\"\n\nOK, so after calling historians stupid. After talking about how they used one rulebook to make a basis of historians, he goes on to talk about documents that exist that tell us more realistic truths and paint an actual, accurate picture of samurai. He tells us how they weren't all super crazy loyal people. He tells us many didn't even use swords. Wow. That's fucking fascinating, historians really must suck. HOW DID THEY NOT TELL US ANY OF THIS INFORMATION? Oh. He didn't dig that up himself? He used work that was done by stupid ol' historians because all of that information is publicly available for reading for anyone that wants to find it? \n\nAnd on top of that HE CLEARLY EXPLAINS THAT POP CULTURE CREATED THAT IMAGE BECAUSE DIRECTORS WERE GOING TO HAVE A CRAZY HARD TIME WITH THE ARCHERS ON HORSEBACK. (which seems like something he pulled out of his ass, but this isn't r/badpopculture). \n\n&gt; 5:25: Why have I spent the past 4 minutes of a podcast talking about samurai? Because samurai are awesome. But also to prove that, up to this point our system of just knowing stuff. About what happened, and what people were and are like, has been more full of shit than we give it credit for. \n\n\nWow. He said everything I could ever want to say about his post right there. Perfect closer. I've never done one of these, so I hope I covered everything and didn't break rules. Feel free to add on if anyone has more knowledge about this stuff than me. And from what I've read I'm sure most of you do!",

If anything, it's more a yardstick (or meter-stick if you're /u/arminius_saw or of such ilk...that being Canadian or of the non-American world) of whether you've made a considerable impression on history, as so many non-historians love to manipulate the evidence to make arguments that historical figures before the twentieth century were gay, bisexual, etc. Part of this revisionism is LGBT activists trying to advance their argument (somehow) by appealing to the sexuality of well-remembered and oft-celebrated historical figures. There's a problem to this sort of revisionism, bit it the result of whichever motivation, which is very succinctly put in an AskHistorians comment by the very gifted and handsome /u/turtleeatingalderman (whose alt this definitely is **not**):\n\n&gt;There are a large of figures in history that have been known to have had sexual relations with members of the same sex, and are (more recently) suspected or argued to have been gay. There's a problem with this that inevitably occurs in the latter judgement—one that requires a sort of presentism with regard to the sexual orientation of figures that would not have fit into such categories as we see them today. The idea of a 'gay' identity doesn't really emerge in western societies until the turn of the twentieth century, with works like George Chauncey's *Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World 1890-1940* argues that sexuality had up until that period been largely defined by gender, in that it was seen that a male taking the penetrative role would not have suffered any sense of masculinity, while the other would be seen as effeminate or 'wanting' to be feminine. It's only with the progression of the early decades of the twentieth century that this idea of sexual inversion starts to get supplanted by orientation as we tend to think of it. John D'Emilio in [\"Capitalism and the Gay Identity\"](http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic464958.files/DEmilio%20Capitalism%20and%20Gay%20Identity.pdf) takes a different but not irreconcilable view, arguing that the interaction between capitalism (and its becoming the dominant economic order) and the family unit allowed individuals to break free from the traditional order that saw sexuality as a means to procreation, and instead began to realize their freedom to explore their interest in the same sex, and begin to identify according to sexuality. Richard Godbeer in *Sexual Revolution in Early America* also touches on this issue, noting (taking a summary from /u/smileyman) that individuals did not think of sexuality in terms of attraction to male or female until fairly recently, and certainly not in colonial or revolutionary America.\n\nOr may we look at [this post authored by /u/smileyman.](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2btc2w/hamilton_laurens_sitting_in_a_tree_kissing_the/)\n\nEdit - Not that there's anything wrong with that...were it true.",

        "text": "There is a [controversial pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Pipeline) being built to bring oil from Canada to refineries and ports in the US. Recently, the US House voted to authorise it, sparking protests and, in the case of the Rosebud Sioux, a [declaration of war](http://boldnebraska.org/rosebud-sioux-tribe-house-vote-in-favor-of-keystone-xl-pipeline-an-act-of-war/). This post is not about the pipeline nor the multitude of politics around it. Rather, it's about an interesting statement made in the article I linked. The article says:\n\n&gt; The Lakota people have always been stewards of this land\n\nin reference to the area occupied by the Lakota in South Dakota. This is an interesting statement on many, many levels. If we look at it from the historical perspective that you or I or this sub are used to, it's likely wrong. It's bad history. On an objective, historical level, the Lakota probably didn't cross the Missouri River until the [18th century](http://wintercounts.si.edu/html_version/html/whoare.html), and didn't get to the Black Hills region until the late 18th century, around 1775. Even beyond that, the Lakota were agriculturalists, likely changing the land and farming it, something which can clash with the idea of stewardship of land. Even the reasons why the Lakota went into South Dakota focus on pressure from rival groups (such as European settlers and other Indian groups) rather than out of a particular pull to a sacred area. To say that the Lakota were \"always stewards of this land\" puts an interesting spin on both \"stewardship\" and \"always.\" By that definition of \"always,\" it's not inaccurate to say that Europeans have always been in the Americas, and we all know that's not really a good way of looking at it. \n\nNone of that, though, is what this post is about. At least, not really. You see, it's not just this one article where you find this idea of the Lakota always having been in the Black Hills. This is an idea that is extremely popular amongst the Lakota and the Sioux more generally to the point where the Black Hills are viewed [as the centre of the world](http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/19/news/mn-35775). They are the birthplace of the Lakota, according to tradition, and should be seen as such. It's this tradition that President Cyril Scott is speaking from when he says that the Lakota have always been in the Black Hills and in South Dakota. He's speaking from a tradition that holds that the Lakota as a people originated in the Black Hills and never really left. \n\nOnce again, from the perspective of the vast majority of non-Native (and some Native) historians, this is inaccurate. The historical and archaeological record doesn't support it. Most evidence points to the Lakota arriving under pressure from rivals, though it's possible they'd been in the Black Hills since 900 CE. Regardless, that is still not \"always.\" There is a point at which there were no Lakota in the area, and it wasn't too terribly long ago. \n\nHowever, I wouldn't be writing all this if that was all there was to it. See, the story of the origin of the Lakota is the perfect illustration of how politicised history can be and how agreeing on how or why something came to be can be an immensely dangerous proposition. From a Lakota perspective, for instance, agreeing that the Lakota were conquerors of the Black Hills would be akin to saying that they have no more right to it than the Europeans do to Native lands. They are as much outsiders as anyone. You can imagine how this would be a problematic position to hold. Equally, saying that the Lakota weren't the first ones in the Black Hills would be denying some fundamental parts of Lakota spirituality, such as the Black Hills being the centre of existence, and that the Lakota were born there. Denying these things would be, in their own way, submitting even further to Europeanisation and losing more of their cultural and ethnic identity.\n\nBut there's another, in my view more interesting, question, and that's the question of what history itself actually is. Here, once again, the Lakota are an excellent example. We here on /r/badhistory tend to subscribe to the view of an objective history of facts, figures, and that things happened in such and such way. It's how history works. There are interpretations, sure, and different perspectives on the same event, but the goal of history is to establish what happened, where, why, and how. It is, however, only one view of what history actually *is* and what it should do. There are different methodologies and ways of approaching history, and there are different \"truths\" that they are striving for.\n\nAllow me to get all philosophical for a moment. I swear, I'll go back to posting about food when I'm done.\n\nWhen researching this post, I came across a lot of Native historians and their justifications for their views on the Black Hills narrative. The article \"Objectifying the Past: Lakota Responses to Western Historiography\" by Mikael Kurkiala is probably the best one at encompassing and summarising these views and the logic behind them. Truth, Kurkiala explains, can be understood in a number of ways and based on what questions are used to determine it. In modern Western historiography, we look at history and ask questions that try to determine what happened, why, when, and how. We are interested in the \"objective\" narrative of events, and want to determine what it is. Therefore, the methodology of this approach to history focuses on determining this narrative and asks questions relevant to it (\"When did the Lakota cross the Missouri?\" \"What evidence is there that they crossed the Missouri?\" \"What do the relevant historical records say about when the Lakota left and why?\"). For the Lakota historians, though, the point isn't necessarily this historical narrative, but rather a different kind of truth entirely. This alternate truth is one of identity, and asks questions centring around *moral* truth rather than *literal* truth. There is a different kind of truth that's held as important and relevant, and it's this divergent idea that creates an alternative version of \"history.\" This version asks questions like \"What is the meaning behind the origin of the Lakota?\" \"What can we learn?\" \"What is our relationship to this place?\" rather than the strict questions of who was where when. It's not just taking different perspectives on truth - it's approaching two entirely different ideas of \"truth\" and what it ought to be. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with alternative versions of truth or alternative methodologies (at least if you're me, which, granted, probably makes up only a small percentage of the people reading this post). The trouble comes in when you apply the methodologies to come to inaccurate conclusions. Looking at the Lakota origin stories as truth in the Western sense of the word is inaccurate - the Lakota weren't in the Black Hills since time immemorial, at least according to a definition of truth that wants to know narrative and causation. Equally, it's wrong to look at the Lakota story of their relationship with the Black Hills and say it's wrong because it doesn't include reference to when the Lakota arrived and why - that's not the point, and that's not the truth that particular form of history is striving for.\n\nAs another example, we can look at the story of Genesis and how it's read. There are many, many readings of it, but I'll focus on two. One of these is that Genesis is an allegory of humanity's relationship to God and how humanity came to be where it is now. The other looks at Genesis as a scientific story of humanity's origins. There's nothing wrong with looking at Genesis allegorically, but there is something wrong with applying a scientific methodology to Genesis. Quite simply, the questions that methodology asks aren't ones that can be answered by Genesis within the framework the methodology provides. It's not a *wrong* reading, but it will give you bad science, just like reading Newton's *Principia Mathematica* as a moral and allegorical text is bad philosophy. There is a framework for whatever version of truth you're striving for, and there are methodologies to accomplish that.\n\nTo be very clear, this is not to say that all interpretations and bad history is right because they're striving for different versions of \"truth.\" Saying that Hitler did nothing wrong is still bad because it's taking one particular methodology and doing it wrong. It's still looking at that \"objective truth\" and coming to a conclusion that can't be supported. The same is true of saying aliens built the Pyramids or that Jesus wasn't real - you're using the historical methodology that wants a literal, narrative truth and coming to a non-true conclusion with it. If we look at the Lakota story this way, then it's absolutely bad history. The Lakota haven't always been in the Black Hills. They showed up there a few hundred years ago. \n\nMy point, though, is that there are different ways of looking at history. There's one very dominant ideology, but that doesn't mean that others don't exist. The Lakota aren't wrong for approaching \"history\" with a different goal in mind. The trouble is when they approach history using the methodology of literal truth and come to the wrong conclusion. My point is also that the history of Native peoples, both in our terms and in theirs, is vastly, hugely more complex than we give it credit for, and it isn't just a matter of saying who got where when. It's a matter of considering that history itself has different meanings for different people, and that the \"truth\" it provides isn't always what we understand to be true. \n\n(I really do recommend the journal article I recommended, if you have access to it. It does a fantastic job of summing up historians' perspectives and explaining why there is a controversy, as well as what the varying definitions of \"truth\" are. It's really quite excellent.)",

Are you fed up with getting \"persecuted\" for things you didn't do? Well have no fear, because r/funny is having a holiday sale on debunked arguments to relieve you of this pressure! Just in time for Thanksgiving when all those strawmen sprout up.\n\n&gt; [Well most natives didn't believe you could own land but whatever.] (http://www.np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2mwjlm/the_toughest_thanksgiving_dilemma/cm8banu)\n\nThis is a very common one, and it's quite simply not true. It probably comes from the Noble Savage idea that natives didn't fight over land because they weren't selfish or valued nature or something. Before going on, I should note that he makes no attempt to differentiate between tribes, which is troubling at best and downright misleading at worst. To cite some examples from [this] (http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1g8v2t/how_accurate_is_the_popular_us_perception_that/) great AskHistorians thread:\n\n&gt; In the early 19th century before Indian Removal, the Cherokee Nation passed a law with a death sentence for any tribal member who signed a treaty giving away any more land. The signers of the 1835 New Echota Treaty were later assassinated/executed in Indian Territory.\n\nAnd\n\n&gt;I also recommend to you a fantastic book called \"How the Indians Lost Their Land\" by Stuart Banner...For example, he points out that many treaties were signed in places where Indians and Europeans had been living side by side for decades. Total misunderstanding on the part of Indians about European concepts of land ownership in such cases seems totally implausible. Indians sometimes had a lot to gain in terms of material goods or alliance promises in exchange for giving up some land. Another example he gives is that many factions within Native American groups supported the idea of selling their lands and moving west. They believed that distancing themselves from the European populations would be the best for their people. It seemed like the less evil of the available options. I think the Cherokee probably provide one of the most notable examples of this internal debate over land sales (but probably because it the most well-documented in the written record).\n\nAnd\n\n&gt;John Weaver's The Great Land Rush and the Making of the Modern World 1650-1900 is really the crucial general work, because it lays out a very consistent pattern for land expropriation by European settlers: determine \"native title\" and primordial ownership, then devise a legal machinery that uproots it and arrogates it to yourself on a European model of registry. In effect the evidence of land ownership and use needed to be defined out of existence or changed into something that could be wiped out in a stroke: \"tribal tenure\" vested in one chief who could be defeated in war and thus lose all the rights (forfeiture), \"terra nullius\" for land in \"disuse\" (used heavily against transhumant people and hunter/gatherers), and of course the penning in of people on barely adequate plots (like the Dawes Act) to prevent \"misuse\" of land that settlers wanted.\n\nAnd\n\n&gt;Many people living within the Triple Alliance and Mesoamerica around the Contact Period followed the altepetl system of land ownership. In a general sense the land belongs to the community - from there, tracts of land were leased in a way to individual families and kin groups within the community. Many of these existing systems were recognized - and utilized - during Colonial legal land disputes.\n\nA user in that thread expands on the Algonquins [here] (http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1eya7m/how_did_native_americans_view_land_ownership/ca535n9) and that is certainly worth reading. Long story short: No, many Native American tribes definitely thought you could own land. \n\nI could cite some more half-wrong statements from the original thread, but they are all covered in the parts I quoted above. These included \"They thought it was community rights not personal\" (wrong in a lot of cases, sometimes right) and \"They were only hunting grounds\" (no, not really). Though there was another comment I saw that touched on something relating to history in a more general sense.\n\n&gt; [Any history prior to the European (not white) settlers was oral history and oral history is utterly inaccurate. So, to anyone who claims there was or was not territorial wars I say: how the hell do you know?] (http://www.np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2mwjlm/the_toughest_thanksgiving_dilemma/cm8ehyu)\n\nOthers have responded to him pointing out that, yeah, we sorta *do* have good ways of knowing if a conflict occurred. But one thing not noted is how important oral history is (not just in America) but to cultures all over the world. Yes we have to critically examine oral accounts, but there's absolutely no reason to just immediately assume they're unreliable! Things like Homer's epics, oral poetry, Mishnah, the Torah, etc. were preserved through oral means. Think of how much in history we only know because there was a oral history that survived long enough to be transmitted to different mediums. Also, what makes him think that written history is any more \"accurate\" in this sense? Last time I checked, written sources can be pretty biased. I just dislike statements like his because it is related to the idea that those in history who were illiterate were somehow stupid or inferior in certain ways. I wonder what this poster would think about Plato, who discouraged writing because he thought it only made students memorize and not learn.\n\nWe must give credit where credit is due, however. The rest of the thread seems to steer clear of such statements like the ones above. There's also a good amount of users calling out these comments and correcting them--though I'm still concerned that the one guy got over 900 upvotes. Ah well. That's all I got. \n",

His innovation? Playing really, really, really fast. \n\nSome nice juicy quotes from the article, and then we can talk about why he's really, really, really wrong. \n\n&gt;\"Nothing has happened with the piano for 300 years – since 1650, nothing,\" he said. \n\n&gt;\"Finally something new has happened in the world of the piano. It's terrible to think I could be the first and the last to do this.\"\n\nFor those of us who are mathematically challenged, 300 years ago was 1714. At that time period, the dominant keyboard instrument was the harpsichord, which was literally played by keys plucking harpstrings. The big limitation of the harpischord is that the player can't control the volume while playing. Some harpischord models can be configured to have louder or softer tones before the player sits down, but the volume can't be adjusted during the performance. \n\n[Harpsichord 101 - How it Works](http://youtu.be/71x4MSlpGUk) (An owner of a harpischord demonstrates how a harpischord works. \n\nThe very first piano is generally attributed to Bartolomeo Cristofori in Padua Italy in the first part of the 18th century. The exact date of the creation is unknown. The earliest examples are from the 1720s, but there are designs and inventory lists from the Medici family (his employers) which seem to indicate much earlier dates (turn of the century). \n\nHowever the piano that Cristofori designed would stay a local phenomenon. He built it for the Medicis, not for wider sale, and it wasn't until 1711 that the piano began to be exposed to a wider audience. That year an Italian writer published an article that would become rather popular, where he raved about this new invention. In the article he included a design of the piano, and other organ and harpischord makers started to make their own samples. \n\nJ.S. Bach was shown a piano as early as 1730 but didn't approve of it and continued to write for the harpsichord.\n\nHowever, Bach's son Carl Phillip Emmanuel Bach is generally regarded as the first composer to write specifically *for* the piano, rather than being a composer who had his keyboard works adopted for the piano. \n\nEarly pianos were tinny and tended to go out of tune quickly. It wasn't until the 19th century that the piano started to really resemble a modern one, and even the early 19th century pianos are remarkably different than the latter 19th century ones. \n\n&gt;\"What Scarlatti was doing, Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev were still doing, 300 years later.\"\n\nScarlatti was born in 1660 and died in 1725. He wrote for the harpischord. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71iUAFFQ8ik) is one of his pieces played on a harpischord. \n\n\n[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8l37utZxMQ) Rachmaninoff playing his Piano Concerto No 2\n\n[Prokofiev's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHIdzZ1P1pg) Sonata for piano and cello op 119. \n\nAnd for fun, here are some pieces played on 18th and 19th century style pianos (which are generally called fortepianos).\n\n[Brahms' op 119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RqswryhLO8) played by Hardy Rittner on a piano made by J. M. Schweighofer’s Söhne between 1876 and 1877. This is pretty close to a modern piano but it lacks the ability to sustain notes and is weak in the treble. Not that Brahms cared too much about the treble anyway. \n\n[Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 29 in B-flat major, Op. 10 (aka the \"Hammerklavier\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFPQ9LxLw3s) 1st movement. Played by Paul Badura-Skoda on a piano (or a copy of one) made by Caspar Schmidt, Prague c. 1810. \n\n[Carl Phillip Emmanuel Bach Fantasia for fortepiano in C major](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUP-LXbWnC0) played by Christopher Hogwood. I don't know what kind of fortepiano he's using. \n\nAnd I'm not going to even start talking about the rest of the Romantic composers, because I'd be here all day demonstrating just how wrong this guy is.

Many of the things you're claiming have had serious doubts cast upon them and more and more scholars are coming to the conclusion he didn't exist. Just saying, in case you want a balanced opinion. Just Google 'did historical jesus exist'. Read a bit, and see how confident you remain in your opinion.\n\n&gt;&gt;Can you source that? I've never heard anything besides most historians agree that Jesus existed. And this isn't religious indoctrination, because I don't spend time with any religious people.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I gave you the exact phrase to Google, there are several sources. I'm just saying I wouldn't be making claims that are in dispute. I'm not making a claim either way.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You could have just said no.\n\nPretty much sums it up. That thread just turns into a bunch of bickering about the burden of googling, with the myther sharing some info about *Antiquities* 18 with no mention of *Antiquities* 20.\n\n[Then SirPwns comes along, lets out a 'LAWL', and shared the same hackneyed and incorrect claims that the others so far have, and accuses the person he's responding to of being a Catholic apologist with an obvious agenda.](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2mpo6c/til_nasa_management_was_so_worried_apollo_10/cm6ptjs)\n\nThen someone responds with a link to our wiki and that of /r/AskHistorians, which I'm going to use to supplement my gossamer of a rule 5. Here you go:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/wiki/good_history#wiki_the_existence_of_jesus\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/faq/religion#wiki_did_jesus_exist.3F\n\nNow we wait for /r/atheism to show up and call us a bunch of idiots.",
