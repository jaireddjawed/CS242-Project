As this is an ongoing competition at work (and some of my colleagues may also be lurking here) I don't want to post the actual riddle just yet, hence the meta tag.\n\nI'm looking for advice on tackling a riddle where the answer is the location of an object. The clue given uses what appears to be a string of linear equations, eg.\n\n`9-5x, 6-2x, 3-1x, ...`\n\nThere's a total of 24 of these given, all in a single line, and there are three underscores ('_') in the, leading me to think it's four words (5, 2, 9, and 8 letters, respectively).\n\nPlotting these as linear equations on a single chart doesn't give much at all - no obvious \"picture\" and the intersections don't really seem to mean much. Also, at least a few of the 'equations' repeat. On that point, I also considered a substitution cipher, but that's definitely not it (used some Python code and a dictionary file to disprove that theory).\n\nThe context of the riddle itself doesn't lend itself to a specific area (eg. not a city or anything, so a specific map can't be discerned).\n\nThe only other thing that stands out to me is that the left number of each 'equation' is always the bigger of the two, but I haven't (yet) figured out if that's meaningful or not.\n\nI know I'm not giving a lot of information here, and I definitely promise to post the riddle in the next couple of weeks, when the answer is known, but does anyone have any suggestions, please, for what other techniques might be employed to tackle such a riddle?",

Despite my best efforts I could not lift a worm. \n\n7. Light does not see me, and neither do you. \r\nSearch with other senses for you know I am true. \n\n8.
