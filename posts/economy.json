This has led to concerns about human rights, freedom of speech, and press freedom in Turkey. The opposition in Turkey has been vocal in its criticism of Erdogan's rule, and there have been some signs of opposition gains. In the 2019 local elections, the opposition won in Istanbul and Ankara, two of Turkey's most important cities. However, Erdogan remains a highly polarizing figure in Turkey, and he still maintains a strong base of supporters.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gsnc4yng4gna1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=04b1f0f988f0f6246e4fdb7b951fbb2c290e8e00)\n\nThe potential impact on the Reddit community will depend on how any political transition is managed and the level of stability that can be achieved. The government's crackdown on opposition voices and the media can make it challenging for individuals to express their opinions freely, including on social media platforms like Reddit.\n\nHowever, if the opposition were to gain power, there could be a greater emphasis on human rights, freedom of speech, and press freedom, which could create a more favorable environment for free expression on platforms like Reddit. Additionally, a more stable political environment could create more opportunities for economic growth and development, which could benefit the Reddit community in Turkey.\n\nOverall, whether the opposition in Turkey has a chance to beat Erdogan remains uncertain. However, any potential changes in political power could have a significant impact on the Reddit community and the wider business and political landscape in Turkey.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678686919.0},{"title":"HSBC Buys Silicon Valley Bank UK.

I call it Chronourgic Capitalism. \"Chronourgic\" comes from the Greek words \"chronos\" meaning time and \"ourgos\" meaning worker. In Chronourgic Capitalism, the government owns and manages natural resources which are used to produce goods and services. To ensure the responsible and sustainable use of these resources, the government charges fees to companies and individuals who use them. This encourages companies and individuals to reuse the byproducts from the resources instead of putting them to waste. Now, if an individual or company decides not to reuse or recycle the resources and continues to produce waste, a waste limit will be put on them. If the individual or company passes the waste limit, they will be charged with a fine. The fine will be a large enough amount to encourage the recycling and reusing of the byproducts instead of putting them to waste. This way, the government can rely less on taxation, providing more financial opportunities for families. The fee system in Chronourgic Capitalism is designed to incentivize resource-efficient practices and discourage waste and overuse. The fees vary depending on the type of resource and the level of use. For example, a company that uses a lot of water or electricity may be charged a higher fee than a company that uses less. The fees collected by the government are used to fund public services and infrastructure, such as healthcare, education, and transportation. The goal of Chronourgic Capitalism is to create a self-sustaining economy that is balanced between the needs of society and the preservation of natural resources. The fee system can also encourage the development of new, sustainable technologies. For example, a company that develops a new technology that reduces waste or increases resource efficiency may be eligible for lower fees and other incentives. In the case of a company extending into other countries and wanting to buy the resources for cheaper from the other companies, they will still be required to pay the fee from the country of origin. Say, a company decides to dump its waste into another country to try and avoid the waste limit fee, it will be monitored by a regulation that requires that company, and all companies, to report on their monthly waste production, making dumping waste into another country and not reporting it, illegal.

There must be some type of price control at the gas pumps. The lies that big oil throws at us in defense of higher prices are too incredible.

Is this what the Federal Reserve wants?","author":"RaggedMountainMan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/economy\/comments\/11olhbn\/is_the_collapse_of_svb_a_good_or_at_least\/","text":"I want to pose the questions and start a discussion.  We all know the Fed is on the warpath against inflation, it has been telegraphed by officials that there is expected to be pain in the economy.  The Fed can't fight inflation without raising rates, you can't raise rates without starting a recession, and you can't have a recession without bankruptcies.  Is the collapse of SVB really that shocking?  I mean it's been painfully obvious that the entire bond market has been crucified by the Fed's QT program.  They've been sitting on these losses in their fixed income portfolios for months now, as have many other institutions.  The Fed must have known about risks to institutions holding fixed income, and this is likely just part of doing business.  If you look at QT as QE in reverse, then it's completely logical to see the industries that benefited from the QE easy money era to have troubles in the QT era.  The QE era mantra of \"You don't fight the Fed\" works in reverse also.\n\nThe next point to be raised is to look at the clients this bank served.  To be fair, I don't know the specifics of what companies or individuals have been affected, but the general gist is these are Silicon Valley, tech, venture capital, cryptocurrency, private equity types.  This is the sector, this is the industry that we have all been watching get bloated with valuations, capital, and irrational upward moves in price.  Is this not the exact industry we want to be pulled back to reasonable valuations?  Look at the now famous pictures of the \"bank run\" we've seen.  These are not working class, needy people seeing their savings vaporized.  These are, by and large, the people that can afford to see large portions of their wealth vaporized.  Consumer demand, housing unaffordability, inflation has been largely progressed by the the upper class with excess capital.  Isn't the collapse and elimination of wealth from this sector of the economy exactly what we want to be seeing in the fight against inflation and wealth inequality?\n\nI'm postulating that the collapse of SVB is maybe not as surprising, or devastating to the economy as all the doom and gloomers are predicting.  This is part of the QT process the Fed is working on, this is what happens when an economy has to be slowed down due to rampant inflation and wealth inequality, and maybe this is exactly what we need to make the economy more fair to the working class.","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1678544766.0},{"title":"This is the problem","author":"brainwashedwalnuts","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/uaojle5lswma1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.68,"created_utc":1678452865.0},{"title":"Silicon Valley Bank Fails: $175 Billion in Deposits Under Federal Control","author":"Express_Turn_5489","url":"https:\/\/www.kumaonjagran.com\/silicon-valley-bank-fails-175-billion-in-deposits-under-federal-control","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678501253.0},{"title":"'Big Short' investor Michael Burry issues a grave warning after Silicon Valley Bank's stock rout: 'It is possible today we found our Enron'","author":"readerseven","url":"https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/big-short-investor-michael-burry-silicon-valley-bank-collapse-enron-2023-3","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1678466938.0},{"title":"What to do with the potential debt crisis looming over the world?","author":"BurstYourBubbles","url":"https:\/\/www.orfonline.org\/expert-speak\/what-to-do-with-the-potential-debt-crisis-looming-over-the-world\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678561605.0},{"title":"31% of new cars sold for above sticker price last month.","author":"pacinothere","url":"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2023\/03\/10\/new-cars-selling-for-the-biggest-premiums-above-sticker-price.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678533678.0},{"title":"High inflation and housing costs force Americans to delay needed health care","author":"HenryCorp","url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2023\/03\/10\/1160702365\/high-inflation-and-housing-costs-force-americans-to-delay-needed-health-care","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678489654.0},{"title":"Biden isn't out of the woods on the economy yet despite job growth, experts say","author":"bobbyw24","url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonexaminer.com\/news\/white-house\/biden-out-of-the-woods-on-the-economy-yet","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678543570.0},{"title":"Roku has one-fourth of its cash at collapsed Silicon Valley Bank","author":"Lionel54321","url":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2023\/03\/10\/roku-san-jose-silicon-valley-bank-tech-fdic-fail-money-economy\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678506304.0},{"title":"With the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, tech may lose a vital organ","author":"thatsocrates","url":"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/45d5a6a9-f17a-4e6b-b72e-4dda304d8867","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678542305.0},{"title":"Are Failing Banks About to Destroy the Economy?","author":"Vailhem","url":"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/v7b4jx\/silvergate-svb-failing-banks-economy","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1678486399.0},{"title":"A major bank failed.

Adjusted operating income margins exceeded 40%, which puts Zoominfo in a rare category of meaningful profitability among higher-growth technology companies. But the key issue with last evening\u2019s financial report had to do with its outlook: 2023 is only projected to grow at high teens. Not bad for any company to be forecasting double digit growth in a recessionary environment, but expectations for Zoominfo had been higher, especially in the light of historical performance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKey Highlights from Q4 2022 Report\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe technology sector has been laying off employees since early-to-mid 2022 to reduce overheads and prepare for potentially weaker business volumes. Even giants like Salesforce (CRM -2.15%\u2193) and Meta (META -2.25%\u2193) could not avoid the fate as recessionary pressures continued unabated and markets demanded to see higher profitability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith 40% of its customer base originating from the software vertical and a largely seat-base revenue model, Zoominfo faced increasingly stacked odds in 2022. While it had enjoyed extraordinary growth in tandem with prevalent hiring in the technology sector back in 2021, those tailwinds recently turned into headwinds. Trying to retain accounts and win new ones when customers (exiting and potential) were retrenching became a tall order.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678408746.0},{"title":"Millennials are building up a mountain of debt in pursuit of the middle-class American dream \u2014 and they're starting to miss credit card payments at an alarming rate","author":"diacewrb","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/millennials-debt-credit-card-payments-afford-middle-class-lifestyle-2023-2?r=US&IR=T","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678274625.0},{"title":"Mining guru Ken Hoffman says U.S. Inflation Reduction Act has 'changed everything' for industry","author":"Vailhem","url":"https:\/\/financialpost.com\/commodities\/mining\/ken-hoffman-inflation-reduction-act-changed-everything","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1678360676.0},{"title":"What Fossil Fuel Executives Really Think About ESG: Oil and gas execs don't actually think \"woke\" investors are starving them of cash.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s, said an impending default would \u201cbe a catastrophic blow to the already fragile economy.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cGlobal financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would likely pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government\u2019s finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it,\u201d Zandi said in opening remarks released before the hearing.\n> \n> The Moody\u2019s analyst also said that a Republican budget proposal to include large spending cuts with the goal of decreasing fiscal spending to 2022 levels over 10 years would prompt a recession next year and result in as much as 2.6 million jobs lost.\n> \n> \u201cSince Republicans have stated there will be no tax increases, and Social Security and Medicare benefits will remain untouched, to achieve a balanced budget would likely mean all but the elimination of nondefense discretionary spending and the Medicaid program,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the dramatic reduction in government spending in this scenario and the already fragile economy, the economy suffers a recession in 2024. The economy\u2019s long-term growth prospects are also meaningfully diminished given the severe fiscal restraint.\u201d\n> \n> Some Republican members of Congress, led by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., are holding out on a debt ceiling agreement for negotiations with the White House over budget priorities, but the U.S. Treasury Department will exhaust all temporary measures to delay default between July and September unless lawmakers raise the debt ceiling, the Congressional Budget Office has warned.\n> \n> As time runs out, a growing number of lawmakers are weighing the Treasury\u2019s ability to avoid a debt-limit breach by prioritizing payments to Treasury bondholders, according to the report. Analysts called the solution \u201cbadly misguided.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cIt would be challenged in the courts,\u201d Zandi said of the workaround. \u201cBond investors, unsure of how this legal uncertainty would be resolved would demand a much higher interest rate in compensation. Moreover, politically, it seems unimaginable that bond investors, that includes many foreign investors, would get their money ahead of American seniors, the military, or even the federal government\u2019s electric bill for long.\u201d\n> \n> Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a right-leaning fiscal policy organization, told the senators that the U.S. will effectively hand economic power to China if it defaults on its debt and endangers its international creditworthiness.\n> \n> \u201cThe notion that we could give up the creditworthiness of the Treasurys and have the world stand by and not go find another reserve currency is missing the big point,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cThey would, and then we\u2019d be handing that opportunity to China. And at this juncture, there\u2019s no reason to do that.\u201d\n> \n> In his opening remarks, Holtz-Eakin also said that skirting default would have \u201cserious and adverse economic effects.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cIt would lead to reductions in stock prices, reducing the wealth of many taxpayers. It would reduce economic confidence, which in turn could reduce consumer spending. It would increase interest rates, leaving taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars of interest payments.
