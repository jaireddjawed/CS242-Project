        "text": "I have been browsing this subreddit for almost a year and I'm really happy to share this first story.\n\n*I work for a small company and run the front of the store for sales and tech question. I also do work for local companies that have trouble with their equipment. It's a nice sunny Saturday and it's quite dead so far until a little old lady comes in.*\n\n$me = me\n\n$OL = old lady\n\n&gt;$OL: Hi there, I'm looking for a plugin for a baby monitor. Do you carry those?\n\n&gt;$me: I'm sorry, we don't sell baby monitors here.\n\n*OL looks over the counter and sees some wall plugs and cigarette lighter adapters in a display*\n\n&gt;$OL: Oh it looks just like those!\n\n&gt;$Me: Oh, the plugin for it is like a usb?(The wall chargers have usb A on the end, nothing else).\n\n&gt;$OL: Yeah, it's kind of like a phone's, but round.\n\nRound? That sounds more like a regular DC plug for something.\n\n&gt;$Me: Do you have the baby monitor with you?\n\n&gt;$OL: I don't, it's back at the house. Oh I have a cable in the car that looks like the one from the baby monitor, should I bring it in?\n\n&gt;$Me: Sure, that works.\n\nShe steps out for a minute to grab whatever plugin she might have. She brings in her plugin. It's not a usb connector, but a basic DC Plug for something. I give it a once over, it looks similar to some old connectors I have in the back of our shop. It also has a DC voltage of 9V.\n\n&gt;$Me: Does this plugin have the same voltage as the baby monitor?\n\n&gt;$OL: Yes, 120V.\n\nI quickly explain the difference between AC and DC Voltage, but don't make any headway.\n\n&gt;$Me: Is there anyway you can bring the plugin for the baby monitor to the shop? If I see it I can compare it to the ones I have in the back of my store and see if they match. \n\n&gt;$OL: What about fixing the old one? Are you able to do that?\n\n&gt;$Me: Possibly, I'd still need to see it, where did it break exactly?\n\n&gt;$OL: Right near the end, my daughter's brother in law already looked at it and he said he couldn't fix it. But can you?\n\n&gt;$Me: If it's broken near the end, unlikely. I can't say yes or no until I see it.\n\n&gt;$OL: Ok, I'll go grab it then.\n\nShe leaves, I return to browsing reddit and other important work related activities. She returns about 15 minutes later with another DC plugin that looks like it'd been through a wood chipper. the cable coming directly out of the power block is frayed and wire is spewing out everywhere. There are flathead screwdriver carvings all along the edges of it as if someone was trying to get into it. The actual charger tip looks like one side has been filed or sanded down so now the round tip looks more like a trapezoid.\n\n&gt;$OL: So the brother-in-law tried to fix it. He wasn't able to. Can you fix it?\n\nI stare at this charger for a couple more seconds before answering.\n\n&gt;$Me: No, I can't do anything with this, but let me compare the tip to one of my old plugs in the back of the store.\n\nI head to the back, see a couple that look pretty close to right, voltage and amps match up, should fit the baby monitor no problem. I show $OL The plugin and she is happy we have one like it. I explain that since it's a used cable and that the baby monitor was not here, I recommended she bring in the actual device(which she hasn't up to this point) to make sure it works for her before I sell my adapter to her. She agrees, and leaves again. After 15-20 minutes go by, $OL returns.\n\nShe drops a plastic bag on our counter with a few items in them. I inspect the goods and get a little confused. In the bag, is a cable modem from #ISP and a router.\n\n&gt;$Me: Where's the baby monitor?\n\n&gt;$OL: What do you mean?\n\n&gt;$Me: This is a modem and router, the things that run the internet in the house.\n\n&gt;$OL: Is that what those are? That explains why the internet hasn't been working in the house. I thought it was a baby monitor... What's a modem?\n\nIn the end, the adapter I had didn't work. I explained that she could get a replacement from #ISP on Monday when they are open, and that would fix the internet trouble.\n\nTL;DR: Old Lady vacuumed a power cable, broke it, thought it was a baby monitor. Asked us to replace/fix it. Brought in the \"baby monitor\". It was a cable modem. I died a little inside.",

        "text": "TL;DR: due to a power outage, $BusinessManager wants \"wireless power.\"\n\nThis was an actual conversation with a $LUser, a mid-level manager at $Company, and then $BusinessManager at $Company, following a pretty major storm that came thru on Thanksgiving weekend and knocked out power to over 100,000 across the region.\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"I didn't get any emails from Friday morning until about 3pm yesterday.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Yeah, looks like your site was without power or Internet until then.\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Well, why didn't I get any emails?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"$Company's email is onsite, in the Exchange server in your server room. When the power cut off, eventually the server shut down after 15 or 20 minutes. With no power, no Exchange server, and thus no email.\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Yeah, but the Internet still works.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Not without power, it doesn't\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"The whole entire Internet around the world was NOT down because we had a power outage in $Town.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"No, you're right, but your email server was inaccessible because it was shut down, due to no power.\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"But the Internet still worked.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Not at your site it didn't.\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"I don't think you know how the Internet works, do you?\"\n\nI manage to ignore this and our conversation turned to ways to mitigate loss of power and Internet at the $LUser's office.\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Well, since I had power at home, why can't I just get emails for everybody?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Uh, wut?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Yeah, can't you just redirect emails to me in an emergency? I could then forward them to everybody else.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"That's not how on-premise email works in the event of a power or connectivity outage...\"\n\nFinally, after some explaining, I started to get some understanding from the $LUser of why cloud-based email for small businesses in areas prone to weather-related outages could be a really good thing.\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"So our email would be delivered and managed someplace else in the world?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Yeah, either on a Google server, or a Microsoft server, in a datacenter someplace where it gets backed up, redundant power, not affected by weather in this region, accessible from anyplace with an Internet connection like home or even a Starbucks or McDonalds.\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Well, why don't we do that?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"It does cost money..\" (gives the user the figures for their number of users, mailboxes, etc)\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"We'd never spend that! We already spent about $3,000 on the email server we have now.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Sure. Over 4 years ago. Its going to be time to upgrade soon, and there is no upgrade path from Small Business Server 2007 to Server Essentials 2012 except with cloud-based email or licensing a separate Exchange server on-premise. And an on-prem server still puts you in the same boat you are now.\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Well, thats pretty expensive. We'll just keep doing what we're doing, I think..\"\n\n&gt;$Me: (under my breath, channeling my mentor) \"And getting the results you always get.\"\n\nLater that afternoon, the $BusinessManager at the $Customer site called. She had clearly talked to $LUser but wasn't getting it.\n\n&gt;$BusinessManager: \"Why was our server off over the weekend?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Because like 160,000 people were without power across the state due to the weather. Your office lost power around 3:45am on Friday.\"\n\n&gt;$BusinessManager: \"But our power was on this morning.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Then your utility company is earning its keep. But the power must have been off for an extended period on Friday through yesterday, based on the time we lost contact with the server and when it started checking in again.\"\n\n&gt;$BusinessManager: \"But....I had power at my house.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Where do you live?\"\n\n&gt;$BusinessManager: [location about 15 miles from the $Company office]\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Well, that part of the town had an outage. Yours didn't.\"\n\n&gt;$BusinessManager: \"But I thought we had wireless power.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Uh, excuse me?\"\n\n&gt;$BusinessManager: \"You know, that uninterruptible thingy. That cost a lot of money.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Yeah, like $800. It only keeps the server alive during brief power interruptions and shuts things down cleanly after the power has been out for an extended period.\"\n\n&gt;$BusinessManager: \"Well, this was a pretty brief interruption.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"By brief, I mean like 10-20 minutes, tops. Not 2 or 3 days.\"\n\n&gt;$BusinessManager: \"That seems kind of limiting, don't you think? If its uninterruptible, why can it shut down?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Its a battery. You want longer term power capability, you need a generator.\"\n\n&gt;$BusinessManager: \"But we already paid for this thing.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"$300 for a UPS is a pittance. You want 2-3 days of continuious power in an outage, you need an emergency generator. Thats thousands.\"\n\n&gt;$BusinessManager: \"We're not spending one more dime on IT that we don't have to. You need to figure this out. We didn't pay $800 to have a power outage, you know.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Right, I'll get right on that with Mr. Tesla and Mr. Edison for you.\"",

        "text": "Whoo. Been busy both at Small Sewing Machine Shop, and at the new job. Fortunately, it’s been pretty quiet. But there has been a situation brewing in the background at New Job, which finally blew up into a problem yesterday morning.\n\nSo, some technical background first. A flat locker (or flat seamer) is not, strictly speaking, a sewing machine. It, like a serger, is a *knitting* machine; that is, it knits its stitches around and through the fabric, which holds it together. Anything (and there are several others that do this) that has a multiple needles and a bottom looper (or more) falls into this category.\n\nThat said, they do have a fair amount of commonality with single-needle sewing machines. Like maintenance, for instance. Maintenance which includes, believe it or not, replacing the needles (ours have four) on a regular, scheduled basis. As a general rule, if you jam it hard enough to break one needle, you should replace all of them. Even if you don’t jam it, they still need to be replaced regularly; they are supposed to be sharp, and they do get dull and burred.\n\nThis hasn’t been happening. As near as I can tell, there have been no scheduled changes, only one-at-a-time-as-needed changes. The stitch quality, predictably, has been going noticeably down, and the machine has been misbehaving more.\n\n**Me, several months ago:** Has anyone asked our Machine Overlords (the company that came in and set us up) for some sort of maintenance schedule? Owner’s manuals or service manuals?\n\n**Boss:** *crickets* (To be fair, OverlordCo is not the best at responding to our requests, for anything, so it likely wouldn’t have mattered had she asked, and that probably factored into her not asking.)\n\n**Me:** Well then, here’s what I recommend. *lays out maintenance schedule for machines, based on issues I’ve seen happen*\n\n**Boss:** *crickets* (No excuse here!)\n\n*insert wavy time jump here*\n\nRemember Calvin’s skulls and daggers swearing? Picture a cloud of those growing around Tammi yesterday morning.\n\n**Me:** What’s up?\n\n**Tammi:** *waves terrible seam at me* Look! Look at this! This is horrible! It will never pass inspection. And I don’t understand WHY!!\n\n**Me:** When was the last time the needles were changed, do you know?\n\n**Tammi:** *thinks* I’ve changed one or two needles in the the other machine, but I don’t think I’ve ever changed any on this one, and I don’t know if anyone else has, either.\n\n**Me:** Let’s change the needles, then, see where that gets us, before we do anything major.\n\nChanging the needles on these things is a pain. They’re super close together, and up against a backing plate, so they have to be set and threaded with tweezers. And patience. And since no one has done it it much, no one has any practice at it. Much fiddling and swearing ensues, (sewing rooms are turning out to be much like commercial kitchens for, erm, creative expressions of frustration, shall we say) but finally it gets done.\n\n**Tammi:** *inserts test fabric under foot, steps on pedal, gets beautiful, perfect seam* Holy shit! *That’s* all it took?! How often do I need to change the needles then? Because this has been a growing problem for the last couple of weeks or so. We’ve already failed a couple of garments because of their seam stitching.\n\n**Me:** *lays out needle change schedule*\n\n**Tammi:** *makes notes*\n\nTammi was changing the needles in the other flatlocker as I was leaving.\n\nLesson learned: Sometimes, it pays to go to the bottom of the totem pole to get things done, not the top.\n\n",

I understand you want to escalate a request for a new computer. What seems to be the trouble?\n\n$Rep: Mine doesn’t work. \n\n$AB: So, I’m looking at your ticket and it looks like you’ve not done any troubleshooting. Tell me more about the problem. \n\n$Rep: I keep getting a message a device wants to connect to my computer. I’m not trying to connect anything. I just need a new one. \n\nI’m mildly nauseated at this point because I realize why I thought her name looked familiar...we just sent her a new computer a few months prior...for a malware issue...that she claimed wasn’t being solved and was keeping her from working. \n\nI walk her through where to find the anti-badthings counter measures and convince her to run them while I prod for more info. She denies everything I ask her and the scans come back clean. The it hits me:\n\n$AB: Have you worked remotely from anywhere other than home? \n\n$Rep: Yeah. A restaurant. \n\n$AB: Did they give you an access code or password to their WiFi? \n\n$Rep: No. What difference does that make? I don’t even have one at home, it’s just automatic. \n\n(A quick silent prayer to the technology gods to give me strength...) \n\n$AB: I need you to shut down your work computer right now. Did you buy your modem and/or router or did your internet provider give it to you? \n\n$Rep: I bought it. What does that have to with anything? I need a new computer. \n\n$AB: No, you need to secure your network. NOW. \n\n$Rep: I can’t. \n\n$AB: You...can’t. Do you have someone there that can? \n\n$Rep: No. Just send me a new computer!!! \n\nHer husband then asks who she’s yelling at. I tell her to put him on the phone. \n\nI then ask $Mr. Rep a few questions to gauge his level of tech savvy and somehow $Rep has convinced him she had a secure login, like a VPN, through work. $Rep kept complaining it “never worked” so he took it off and never got around to trying to fix it. I resist the urge to bang my head on the desk and then tell him exactly what he needs to do and set him off to call the router manufacturer for help. Since the router is not company-owned equipment and it’s in her home I can only give advice. \n\nMeanwhile, her manager has been messaging  me and asking when $Rep is getting a new computer. I call her and explain the situation. She seems OK with it so I sign off and go to bed. \n\nThe next morning I have a barrage of messages from the Manager’s Manager demanding the tracking number for $Rep’s new computer. Cue facepalm. \n\nI ask one of my TSRs to call $Rep and verify her network security while I run interference with these two managers. Both of whom are adamant $Rep is supposed to be getting a new computer. I lay it on the line: \n\nTL;DR: Sales Rep uses not one, but two unsecured networks while working remotely and gets a persistent message asking permission to allow an unfamiliar device to connect to her computer. Her network security is now verified with screen shots, the device no longer shows up on her home network and the message no longer appears. $Rep has been reminded that she is REQUIRED to maintain a secure connection at all times. All is well, not getting a new computer. ",

        "text": "I work customer care over the phone and today I had a new tech listening to my calls. Customer dropped his phone in water and wanted me to fix it.\n\nMe: you can put the phone in rice but the reality is water damage is like a ticking time bomb. It can kill your phone right away, or the damage may reveal itself months down the line. You may not have to get another phone right away, but you'll want to consider replacing it soon\n\nHim: I don't get it. Why would my phone fail over time?\n\nMe: think of your phone like the human body. It's made up of all these parts, and eventually one or more of those parts will age and fail. Water damage would be like injuring your body, and while your body might not fail in the moment, down the line you're at a higher risk for other issues.\n\nHe ponders this for a moment.\n\nHim: so you're saying that the phone is like the human body... It's fine if my body gets wet, so why can't I put my phone in the water?\n\nMe: sir, your body is an organic life form and your phone is electronic equipment. Water is fine for your body, but not for your phone.\n\nCue grumbling and end of call.\n\nI look at the guy listening to my calls and say, \"Welcome to tech. These people are your life now.\"",

        "text": "Obligatory \"on mobile so formatting might be off\" comment, so please tell me if it looks terrible. I'm also typing this on the bus because I forgot my earphones and need something to take my mind off sitting in silence with strangers.\n\n\nSo this happened the other day. I work on a normal service desk for companies that pay us to provide support. I should apologise because the details won't be great, my memory isn't what it used to be.\n\n\nA stern looking (we can see their photos on  emails and staff directory and I looked him up afterwards) and grumpy gentleman (SLaGG) phones up, I go through my intro and he doesn't say a word, simply gives me the reference and nothing more. The name rings a bell but I can't quite put my finger on why. He'd had issues with trying to connect remotely from home an hour before and spoken to my colleague, who'd managed to get him to do more than I could the last time we spoke, but not resolve it.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: So you're having issues connecting remotely?\n&gt; \n&gt; SLaGG: Yes, I wasted however long on the phone this morning, and now I've wasted an hour waiting for a call back, as well as wasting time last week. How much longer am I going to have to wait?\n&gt; \n\n\nAnd it hits me, it was me he spoke to nearly 2 weeks ago on a very short call. After going through checking only one setting in the networks centre which had already taken long enough, (because he was reluctant to cooperate, expecting me to just fix it with my magic skills) he ended the call rather quickly.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; SLaGG: Forget it, I don't have time for this, I'll just have to scrap it now.\n&gt; *Hangs up*\n&gt; \n\n\nSo I closed the call \"not continuing to attempt to resolve call\"\n\n\nBack to the current call, I look through the ticket and my colleague had sent it to the networks team. I had an idea of what the fix would be but I was really hoping I would be wrong so I called networks up to query it and they confirmed what I didn't want them to, he needed to come into office. After the a fair amount of opposition last time, and complaining that I can't exactly remember, this time, I really REALLY didn't want to tell him that. \n\n\nNow I warn you, this doesn't end dramatically, but still quite surprisingly.\n\n\nI get back on the phone with him, and it goes a little something like this:\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: So I've just spoken to the network team\n&gt; SLaGG: Okay...\n&gt; Me: And basically we need to copy a file over to your machine, but we need you to be connected to the network, which means you'll need to come into office\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *10 seconds of silence that feel like an eternity*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; SLaGG: Okay... Um......\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *Seriously. Another 10 seconds of silence*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Me (I can't sit waiting for him to get his head round it and go off on me): Do you know when that will next be?\n&gt; SLaGG (surprisingly compliant): Uhm, I'm not sure, probably Monday.\n&gt; Me: Okay I'll suspend this until Monday and we can go through it then, alright?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *another few seconds with some um-ing and uh-ing*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; SLaGG: And this will fix it? How long will it take?\n&gt; Me: Not long at all once you're on in office and it should fix it but we can test it at the time and go from there if there is still an issue.\n&gt; SLaGG: Okay, I might make into random area office on Friday but it'll likely be Monday.\n&gt; Me: No problem at all, you can always call us if you're in sooner.\n&gt; \n\n\nAnd without much resistance, we were politely - as awkward as it was - saying goodbye.\n\n\nTo my surprise he was calm, and perfectly okay with the information I'd presented to him and I could go on with my day as happy as usual. I suspect he realised this could have been done in the first instance and so just went along with whatever would get it sorted quickest.\n\nTL;DR: network issue that could have been sorted 2 weeks before but was abandoned by the user, now needs fixing again. He complains then surprisingly complies with not so much as a question or 2 to confirm what we were going to do.\n\nBONUS: I found my earphones! They were in my cardigan pocket, yes I wear a cardigan, get on board with it, it's beautiful.\n\nEDIT: Picture of cardigan: http://imgur.com/ZmRwLpd",

        "text": "This occurred at the same $EducationalNonProfit as my [previous tale](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/84hqad/this_one_was_worthy_of_dilberts_boss/?st=jeu1v2yx&amp;sh=5ef8beff).  With the same $LUser. \n\nThis was right around the time we transitioned them from a hosted Microsoft Exchange through their old MSP to Office 365 and Exchange Online thru Microsoft. Because it was their \"slow period,\" and they didn't have a need for weekend email, the plan was to kick off the email transition on a Friday, and push the last of the mailbox contents \"from cloud to cloud\" over the weekend. \n\nWe'd worked with $BusinessManager to inform the employees that their email would be in a state of transition over the weekend, and on Monday morning we'd have $FieldTech onsite to create new profiles, etc. *Everybody* was clued in. Except, of course, for our favorite $LUser. We assumed she was going to be a challenge because of her usual tendency to make assumptions based on a negative understanding of the tech, ignoring instructions and training, jumping to conclusions about causes and blame, and using lots of buzzwords in an attempt to sound smarter than she was.  I even had an indepth conversation with $BusinessManager and $LUser the week before the transition to set expectations. $BusinessManager totally got it. $LUser refused to.\n\nThe Support Line rings that Monday morning. Seeing the caller ID, I answer, expecting it to be $FieldTech calling from $EducationalNonProfit's site with a question.\n\n&gt;Me: \"Good morning, $BigBossCompany, ITCustodian speaking.  How can I help you?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"There is a problem with our VPN! This has been going on for 2 days!\"\n\nI recognize that its $LUser. Oh boy. I'm thanking my lucky stars that I assigned $FieldTech to visit this customer and that I'm not there. Dealing with $LUser in person on a Monday morning? No enough coffee in the world to prepare one for that.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Two days? What, hold on. Let me check this.  [Assuming she knows a VPN from a hole in the ground, I log in to $EducationalNonProfit's VPN via my laotop] Nope, your VPN is working fine. What are you trying to do?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"I just sent myself an email and it didn't show up.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Wait, what? No, $LUser, email has nothing to do with your office VPN. You remember that your office is in the middle of an email transition, right? Where did you send the email from?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"My laptop.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Which hasn't been setup with the new email profile yet.\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"I thought that was automatic?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"No, email is being delivered to Office 365 after Friday's cutover, and your laptop right now is still looking to the old hosted Exchange. Remember how we arranged to have all $EducationalNonProfit's laptops on site today so $FieldTech can point your laptop at the new Office 365 setup?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"But, but...the VPN doesn't work!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"The VPN has nothing to do with your email and hasn't since $EducationalNonProfit switched off your on-site Exchange to that hosted Exchange email over a year ago.\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"No, thats not right. You don't know how our email is configured!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: (Inwardly) \"Oh, here we go again. $LUser accusing us of not doing our jobs.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Oh? Hmmm. Perhaps you are right. Which part isn't configured right?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Well, to start with, the VPN doesn't work.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"I'm logged into your VPN right now. It is working fine. I just remoted into your file server. I'm also logged into your new Office 365 account and your mail is working and receiving emails.  $FieldTech is onsite, setting up the other laptops for the $OtherUsers in the office, so once he configures your profile to point to Office 365, you'll see that mail is working, hmmm?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Well, you better fix the VPN, too!\"\n\nThere was no reason for her to even be trying to access the VPN. You usually can't hit a SonicWall VPN from inside the network, anyway, but there's no need to VPN into the site FROM the site, so I can't quite figure out what $LUser is trying to do. \n\nLater that morning, $LUser calls the support line again.  I'm not sure why she keeps calling the support line with $FieldTech right there. The office isn't that big. Its not like he's lost or something.  Remember, this is the $LUser who claims she doesn't want to call us for \"every little thing.\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"My contacts aren't on my phone! I told you the VPN was goofed up!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Did $FieldTech setup your phone for Office 365?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Yes.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Did he tell you it would take a few minutes for your phone to sync to Office 365 and some time for everything to appear on your phone?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Yes.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"And how long has it been since he setup your phone?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"About 10 minutes.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"OK, this process isn't instantaneous. You actually have the biggest mailbox of anybody at $EducationalNonProfit, and likely your phone is still doing its initial sync with Office 365. Is $FieldTech still there?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"He is. I told him there was a problem and he told me I had to wait for-\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Did he tell you that you had to wait for your email, contacts &amp; calendars to sync?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Yes! I also sent myself an email from my personal account and I haven't gotten it yet!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: (checking $LUser's inbox via the web interface) \"I see that test email in your Office 365 inbox on the cloud. The reason your phone hasn't gotten it yet is that it is still syncing stuff and hasn't caught up yet.\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Its because the VPN is screwed up, isn't it?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Can you find $FieldTech and put him on the phone for a minute, please?\"\n\n$LUser &lt;hands over phone to tech, who is apparently standing right there&gt;\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Is it still syncing?\"\n\n&gt;$FieldTech: \"Yep. The other phones have gotten their contacts from 365, no reason to expect this one won't except for the volume of mail being sync'd.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"If she continues on about this contacts thing, offer to wipe her phone to factory as the only option.\"\n\n&gt;$FieldTech: (laughing) \"Will do!\"\n\nLater that afternoon, the support line rings. Its $LUser again.\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"I sent myself an email from my $EducationalNonProfit account to my personal account and I haven't gotten it yet!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Where did you send it from?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"My laptop.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Can I remote into your laptop? Hmmm, wait, I can't remote in, it doesn't show that it is online.\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"I disconnected it from the wifi.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Why?\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Because I want to connect to the VPN!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Well, you can't just connect to the VPN-\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Ah ha! I've been telling you all along the VPN was screwed up.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"No, you can't connect to the VPN because you actually need to be connected to *some kind of network connection* to get to the VPN. Doesn’t matter, because as you know, you can't connect to the VPN from inside the $EducationalNonProfit network. You have to be outside the $EducationalNonProfit network to connect to the VPN.\"\n\n&gt;$LUser: \"Now you're just making up excuses.\"\n\nA little while later, my $FieldTech called from the road on his way back to the office. \n\n&gt;$FieldTech: \"$LUser complained constantly about her contacts.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"And?\"\n\n&gt;$FieldTech: \"I told her she had to wait a bit for them to sync up, its not instant.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"And the contacts eventually sync'd, right? How long did it take?\"\n\n&gt;$FieldTech: \"Maybe 5 more minutes after she initially complained. She kept saying over and over that I screwed up her phone.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"What about the emails she kept sending herself?\"\n\n&gt;$FieldTech: \"She would click send on an email from her Gmail account, and then, before the email had even left the outbox, she was frantically clicking send and receive on her laptop, on her desktop, and refresh on her phone. When she didn't see the email in like 5 seconds, she kept insisting something was wrong.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Did you tell her that email takes a little bit to go from A to B?\"\n\n&gt;$FieldTech: \"Yep. Sure did. She refused to believe me. Said that we screwed her laptop up. And something about the VPN?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: &lt;*facepalm*&gt;",

        "text": "I got sent to one of our remote offices yesterday. And I mean remote. Remote enough, that it doesn't justify having someone there. Can't tell you where, since it is a pretty well known location. But this office has 6 people in it.\n\nOver the last few weeks they have been experiencing network outages, the ISP, and myself have been working together to figure out where the issue was a occurring. Nothing. Couldn't figure it out, so accounting told me to pack my bags and go out there myself. \n\nI arrive, and the issue has resolved itself, it's been 3 days since the networks gone down, but I'm here so I might as well take a look at everyone's PCs and check on everything. \n\nFirst user's PC I check out, has no password for the Admin account. And the user doesn't lock it when she leaves. On top of that it is out of date. *Heart Attack*\n\n&gt;Ma'am, you know you have no password for your admin account, right?\n\n&gt;Oh, yeah, the last IT guy got rid of it for me.\n\n*Eye twitch, heart attack #2*\n\nCheck on the users PC, 3 years out of date. \n\n&gt;Ma'am, why isn't your PC updating?\n\n&gt;Oh, the last IT turned that off cause it was bothering me.\n\n*Shudders* \n\nShe goes home early, since I am taking too long on her PC. And I fix all the stuff \"the last IT guy\" undid for her. And I set UAC so it can't be undone by anyone but me. After I create her, her own profile, and copy all of her files over.\n\nMove on to the other users, most are fine, and are too afraid to mess with the settings in case they break something. I like users like that, gold star for them.\n\nI get to the front desk receptionist, and start working on her PC. Everything looks ok, update office, and do a restart. \n\n&gt;Ok, ma'am, your PC is updated and good to go. If you could go ahead and log in, I'll take a look at the printer issue you had.\n\n&gt;Oh, go ahead and log on yourself, the password is on my monitor. \n\nHer desk, is in the middle of the office. 5 clients were standing around talking to the other employees. *internal screaming*\n\n&gt;Ma'am, there is only one sticky note on your monitor, and it says \"sarah\"...\n\n&gt;Yeah, that's my password, just don't forget to not capitalize the 'S'.\n\n*Heart Attack #3*\n\nI log in, fix the printer issue, and move on. Planning the meeting I was going to have with everyone before I left. \n\nI head into the file room, where the file server is located. Plugged into the file server is a postage machine connected to the file server. \n\n(if you don't know what a postage machine is, it is a machine that weighs, stamps and charges your account for sending packages, [like this](https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/shipping-and-mailing/postage-meters/sendpro-c-200.html) )\n\nI look through my notes, I didn't write down the password before I left, so I call up the person who used to manage this office (non IT person, she still works for us, but not in IT at all), she let me know what it was. \n\nThe front desk lady comes in.\n\n&gt;Oh good you found the password?\n\n&gt;No, I called [Jess] she let me know what it was.\n\n&gt;Oh, cause it's written on the pad in the break room.\n\n*Internal scream intensifies* \n\nI go and checks. Sure enough there is a pad, sitting on the counter of the break room, with step-by-step instructions on how to use the postage meter, as well as the user name: Administrator and Password: (luckily it actually followed the best practices, and then some).\n\nBut then I realize, they are logging into the administrator account, to use a postage meter. \n\nI halt everything, and stop work. I start to tell all of them what is wrong, and I hear this:\n\nEmployee #1\n&gt;I can't change my password, it's been the same password since High School, it's an inside joke, that you wouldn't get. It's totally not easy to guess. \n\n&gt;Ma'am your password is Love777, that is literally on the list of the most used passwords of all time. The only password used more than that is Love 123, or Love143. Change it. Now. \n\nEmployee #2\n&gt;But mine is my dogs name, no one is ever going to guess that. \n\n&gt;They don't have to guess it, you have it posted on your monitor, and you told an entire room of people what your password is. Change it, now. Please. \n\nEmployee #3\n&gt;Oh man, [Tess] is not gonna like that you added her password back. \n\nIt went on. I fixed everything and left. I get off the plane, and head back to the office, I let me supervisor know, and now I am giving a presentation at our next all staff, where everyone from the entire company flies in for this meeting. \n\n*Stroke*\n\nNames, and password have been changed, but seriously, they were not increased in difficulty. If I capitalized a password, that is no me. They would never do that... ",

What does a battery look like? I've never seen it before.  \n\n&gt; $Me: Well, it's a long, thing and rounded piece that sits in that gap at the back of your laptop. \n \n&gt; $Student: Oh, that! It was in the bottom of the laptop case this morning. I didn't know what it was so I threw it on the sofa.",

        "text": "I'm the Support Desk Manager for a quality assurance software company.  Our product sends out notifications to defined user groups when a new document is uploaded.  We've just set up a new client who has raised 10 tickets this week already (each one invariably becoming a dozen emails at least) - every one of them so far has been a training issue on their end (we'd been warned that they paid no attention in their training sessions). \n\nOne thing we've been dealing with is explaining to their IT desk how to whitelist our email relay (they seriously didn't know how to), as the notification emails were being flagged as spam at their end.  Copied into this chain of emails is the client's Quality Manager - who has also been emailing me separately with queries about how notifications work in general.\n\nAfter 15 emails, where I've taken screenshots of the step-by-step process of uploading documents, setting up notification groups, highlighting which notifications will be sent when the email issue is resolved, I'm pretty exasperated. \n\nThen I get a phone call... my heart sinks when I see the number - it's the Quality Manager. \n\nShe proceeds to blast my company for our 'terrible' software, and that it's just not working how it was sold to her.  Once she'd calmed down (I don't think she actually took a breath for 10 minutes) I start probing her to find out what her complaint actually is.  It boils down to 'why am I not getting emails?'.\n\nSo I pointed out to her that she is involved in the email conversation I am having with their IT Desk about preventing system notifications from being marked as spam, to which she replied 'yes, but I don't see what that has to do with anything'.\n\nWhy...why didn't I chose to be a Dentist instead...

Which is why I had also provided a smartphone that generated a wifi hotspot for the laptop.\n\nNow not only am I kind of flabberghasted that the people working there decided to dig up evaluation forms they had used 5 years ago to test the difference between an ipad, chromebook and an android-based tablet instead of clicking on the link I sent them to use my form.\n\nOn the back of the forms someone had written. \"The phone is off, we can't do anything with this!\"\n\nSo, yeah kind of weird that to put that on a feedback form instead of giving me a call or something.  \nI checked out the phone, and whaddaya know, the battery is completely drained.  \n\nApparently these people also disregarded the notion that you need to charge a phone in order to keep it working.\n\nWell at least it failed near the end of the testing phase and the results I got were good enough to help me make a decision on wether or not to implement that chromebook or not.",

        "text": "Hello TFTS, This story happened not 5 minutes ago and I just had to share it. I work as the unofficial IT guy for a small maintenance company and all the office employees are housed in the same room which isn't so bad. If anyone has any computer problems, then It's only 10ft or so to either of the two other desks that are occupied on a daily basis. I got a great view of both AR and AP desks. The computer with the most problems is the AR computer. It's always a bit slower and takes its sweet time to start up when it feels like it. I've scanned, cleaned and deleted (15GB of stuff in the recycle bin!) to get it up and running at acceptable speeds. AR lady leaves at roughly 4pm every day and today as she is grabbing her purse and coat and things to head out the door, I see her shut her computer down,... chloroform rag style. I quickly stood up to confirm what I had just seen. and the conversation goes as follows.\n\n\n&gt;**LHM**: Did you just,..? Did you just shut your computer down?\n\n\n&gt;**AR**: I sure did, I gotta go.\n\n\n&gt;**LHM**: How did you shut it down? Did you tell it to shutdown?\n\n\n&gt;**AR**: Yup.\n\n\n&gt;**LHM**: Did you open the start menu and shutdown from there?\n\n\n&gt;**AR**: No, I just pressed the button\n\n\n&gt;**LHM**: Ok, You can't shut it down like that. That will ruin your computer. \n\n\n&gt;**AR**: But it's ok, I had all the windows closed. I don't see what the problem is.\n\n\n&gt;**LHM**: shutting it down is like holding a chloroform rag up to a persons nose until they pass out. If your computer was trying to do updates or anything when you did that, it could corrupt your OS\n\n\n&gt;**AR**: Ohhh, Yeah, it said it wanted to do updates yesterday when I shut it down but figured it would do them after it shutdown after I'm done for the day.\n\n\n&gt;**LHM**: How often did you shut it down like that? \n\n\n&gt;**AR**: Everyday since I started working here. \n\n\nNaturally I let her know that is most likely the reason why her computer hates waking up in the morning and why it's always giving her problems. She has been working here for just over 2 years and I have as well but I've only been in my current position for a couple of months else I would have caught it ages ago. ",

However, this morning, I got to add a tally to yet another team member I almost accidentally killed.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n$LawnGnome was tasked with setting up a VPN on one of our client's server. Not wanting to use his own computer as the guinea pig (since the VPN client required a reboot) he instead opted to grab a laptop from the warehouse. Well, upon hitting the power he was presented with a myriad of light codes. So, after a bit of troubleshooting, he found out the laptop didn't have any ram. He came back up with some new ram but still no dice. Thinking it was more bad ram he went downstairs to grab a different set.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMeanwhile I decide to do some poking of my own thinking it's a battery issue. While the the laptop is still half-naked I end up putting the ram back in, plugging the power adapter back in, and seeing if the computer would POST without the battery. Nope, still nothing so I decide it's back to the drawing board for me. \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nWell, $LawnGnome came back upstairs with new ram and went to go swap the ram that I put back in. Upon touching the ram he immediately noticed a couple things:  \n\n* He felt weird  \n* The Office felt like it was moving  \n* He started getting light-headed  \n* He was getting hot like the temperature suddenly went up  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThinking he was just worn out from taking the stairs he soldiered on swapping out both sticks of ram. He put the laptop back together and went to plug the computer back in....only to realize it had been plugged in the whole time. And that's when it hit him:  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$LawnGnome:** Hey guys...I think I just electrocuted myself\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd sure enough he did. Now about this time $Burrito and $ExtD both fessed up that they too had had a shocking experience (literally).  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n$Burrito was working in a run down server room and plugged in a PoE. Well, let's just say there was some exposed wiring on the patch panel, she put her hand on the wrong port, and essentially became one with the network.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n$ExtD was trying to reach behind a rack to plug in a battery backup and had to eyeball it since she couldn't see the outlets. In her infinite wisdom she put her finger on one of the prongs to get a better grip. Good news? The plug made contact with the outlet. Bad news? **She** made contact with the outlet.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Cure Light Wounds? Cure Moderate Wounds?**  \nAll three of them are fine. $LawnGnome has some short term memory loss from the shock (figurative), but he's otherwise okay. $ExtD and $Burrito are fiiiine.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR:** Electro-static discharge wristbands? Yeah, do they make that for 120v outlets?  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: Spelling and formatting",

We are in the process of getting a faster connection installed but $AT&amp;T has been 'working' on that install for over a year (I kid you not!).

I am concerned that if we have new cameras on our network that it will strain our already taxed links to your site and to the Internet.\n\nThe response, which shut me up:  \n\n&gt; This is not our equipment. This is the cameras that are in our parking lot and near our loading dock but belong to another company and we would just access their feed. We have requested this access because we have people here 24 hrs and we want to be able to put the camera feed up on our Wall Tv’s, so we can monitor the loading dock and parking lot. *We had a van get mugged at gunpoint in the parking lot a few months ago* and began working with the other company. They were going to supply the additional camera and set up and we would monitor the system.  \n\n I've been to this office. I didn't consider it to be in a shady area but I guess it's shady enough. I opened the ports on the firewall for them.\n",

I look at it, annoyed for a second until I see that it's the Stockroom Manager (**$SM**) calling. She's a lady in her late forties, often very nice to talk to. Could be worse I think to myself.\nI answer the phone, expecting something simple.  \n**$Me**: Servicedesk, $me speaking.  \n**$SM**: Hello, our label printer won't stop printing. It says there is 80.000 labels in the queue.  \n**$Me**: Have you tried pulling the power?  \n**$SM**: Yes, but it wont stop printing.  \n**$Me** (confused): Even with the power gone?  \n**$SM**: No, but as soon as I put the plug back in it starts printing again.  \n**$Me** (sigh of relief): Okay, good. These labels, were they sent from $ERP system?  \n**$SM**: Yes.  \n**$Me**: Have you tried shutting the $ERP application down?  \n**$SM**: Yes, but the computer is frozen.  \n**$Me**: It probably is just the application. Let me remote in and have a look.  \n\nThe first thing I see when I connect is that our $ERP application not responding. Then I notice that the \"Number of copies\"-field indeed had just above 80.000 filled inside of it. No wonder the application crashed. What's even more mysterious is that this a field that you have to manually edit. I'm having trouble figuring out how this is an accident. Whatever, solve the problem first I think to myself.  \n\nI start the task manager and close the application. I then connect to the server that is responsible for label printing.  \nShit. Labels are still being sent to the printer. The job is still being processed by the $ERP server. I quickly connect to it and start browsing through active sessions. Indeed, I find that eventhough we killed the application on the stockroom computer, the session on the server was not terminated. I promptly end the session.  \nFinally I connect to the printer server and clear the printer queue; just above 900 labels.\n  \n**$Me**: Try turning on the printer now. It should be fixed now.  \n**$SM**: You're right it doesn't seem to be printing anything now. Thanks.  \n**$Me**: Do you remember what you were doing when this happened? The number of copies field has to be entered manually.  \n**$SM**: I wasn't here at the time, but me and my staff thinks that someone might have accidentally scanned a barcode..  \n\n\n",

        "text": "Hello TFTS, Bowling Alley Guy here with a tale of the most frustrating and bewildering repair I've ever had the privilege of making. Naturally, we shall begin with the most interesting part first.\n\n- - -\n\n**The Teaser**\n\n&gt; $Me: (photo message to $GM) You will never believe what's been causing our problems on 15 or how I fixed it.\n\n&gt; $GM: What the hell is that? Where was it?\n\n&gt; $Me: I'll explain in detail in person. It's so absurd.\n\n**The Backstory**\n\nFor a period of approximately two months we were having an intermittent, yet frustratingly persistent issue with lane 15. What was happening, was that occasionally the pinsetter would cycle twice consecutively, resulting in the bowler having their spare swept away and then us mechanics getting a call to set it back up. Most of our open play customers don't really care about sticking to the rules and will just ignore those issues, but we did have a small league that used 15 &amp; 16 every week. They are possibly the worst league I have ever worked as far as problems go, with multiple issues caused by bowler error *on every lane they use* while they're bowling. For the first week or two, I just brushed off these respot calls as another symptom caused by this particular group of bowlers.\n\nHowever, once it was brought to my attention that the machine was double cycling during a particularly troublesome day for lane 15, I began my diligent troubleshooting. Most importantly, I wanted to watch it happen with my own eyes, since any of a number of different problems could cause double cycling as a symptom and it's important to know which ones can be eliminated as culprits as quickly as possible.\n\nThe problem was, it was so intermittent and unpredictable that after another week of watching over it I had yet to see it actually occur. As far as I could tell, the machine was running just fine, and only the *User Error League* was having problems with it. Skeptical as I was though, as I prepared my $BeAmateur camera to monitor it, it finally happened while I was watching, in fact, several times. This let me confirm that it was indeed a technical issue as well as give me the first information I had about the nature of it.\n\n**The Context**\n\nI've described our computerized scoring system, $OldScoring, in a previous story, but for the sake of simplicity I'll go over it again real quick. Each pair of lanes has a few modules installed to perform all of the scoring functions. Between the lanes on the gutter capping is the **camera module ($CM)** which takes a photo of the pins so the system can determine what pins remain standing each turn. Also mounted between lanes under the graphic wall and just in front of the pinsetters are a pair of **ball detect ($BD)** infrared beam sensors and reflectors, which allow the system to detect a ball passing by. Above the pinsetters on the wall is the **curtain wall chassis ($CWC)** which interprets all the information from the different modules and the bowler's keypad, and calculates the scores to display on screen. And finally, technically part of each pinsetting machine, is the **time delay ($TDM)** module, which is set to wait between 2 to 5 seconds to allow pins to fall before allowing the pinsetter to be cycled after a ball is thrown.\n\nThe interface between pinsetter and scoring is painfully simple, literally just a single component called the **cycle solenoid**. All this solenoid is, is an electromagnet that pulls in a steel plunger when activated, and in this case that plunger pulls on the lever that starts the pinsetter's cycle. That's the only part of the machine the scoring computer interacts with. One could actually install an evil malevolent AI in our scoring computers and the only thing it would be able to do is start the pinsetter's cycle. So consider bowling machines future-proof in that regard.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nWith this particular type of pinsetting machine, nearly every function is controlled through some kind of mechanical force or connection. That kind of complexity means there are many, many issues which can cause one to cycle twice, or run past the end of a cycle into the next one, or stop suddenly mid cycle, etc. However, the moment I saw the cycle solenoid pull and begin a second unwanted cycle I was able to eliminate every single one of those entirely. The only thing that would cause the solenoid to energize would be an electrical issue, most likely relating to the scoring system somehow. And after watching the problem happen several times, I noted how it would suspiciously happen shortly after finishing the previous cycle, nearly an identical amount of time after as the setting on the $TDM.\n\n**The Eventual Solution**\n\nWell, armed with this knowledge that the scoring system was responsible for the occasional double cycle, I immediately lost all hope of being able to solve it. Not quite, but it did mean that the issue lay in a system I still didn't understand very well, and which we had few, if any replacement parts for. However, it needed to get solved, so I started my troubleshooting with the simple things first. Having noted how similar the amount of time between cycles was to the time delay setting, I replaced the $TDM with a brand new one we had ordered the month before. With a little bit of free time, I tested it by bowling two games and the issue seemed to be gone, although at this early stage I was still skeptical of our User Error League.\n\nHowever, the issue remained and the next day I came in to a long note about how many problems it had caused the evening after my first repair attempt. Now with even less of an idea of where to look than before, I decided to switch into \"throw parts at the problem\" mode, and decided to go straight to replacing the $CWC. These things have caused all manner of strange issues in the past and we've had to replace them regularly. But being a system first released in the early 1980's, working replacements are difficult to find and the huge number of unusable $CWCs we had piled up in the back meant I had no good spares. So after a couple weeks of fixing more important issues that kept popping up, I decided to do a part swap with a known working $CWC on another pair of lanes. Lane 3 was down at this point with an extremely serious issue (similar to needing the engine and transmission in a car replaced) so I swapped the $CWC from 3/4 with that from 15/16 to see if the problem would move. This time I did my due diligence, and bowled 5 games without a single instance of the double cycling problem showing up. I considered the problem solved.\n\nThat evening, however, the bowlers didn't. In fact the issue came back with a vengeance, happening as often as every 3 or 4 frames at times. I felt completely defeated. I'd replaced the only two parts of the scoring system that I knew of that controlled machine cycling, and in 7 games of testing had never seen the issue return. While my attention was once again focused on more serious issues, I instructed my more senior mechanic to try swapping the $BD sensors with another pair next. After this, I was out of options as far as I could tell. All the camera did was take photos, and the keypad the bowlers used could only cycle the machine if they pressed a 3 button sequence, so it was pretty much impossible they were still the cause. In fact, the reset buttons on the ball rack had long ago been disabled by the prior mechanic to stop such nonsense.\n\nThe double cycling continued. Leagues were moved to avoid them having to use the problem pair of machines. About this same time I was called into a meeting with my boss $GM, and his boss, about the huge number of problems that had been occurring lately and the slow, or sometimes non-existent repair time. Some problems were being left for weeks or months, simply because our mechanical staff was being overwhelmed, but of course it was my responsibility to prevent that from happening. It was revealed that the User Error League was planning not to return for the next league season because of the persistent issues, which we were all secretly glad to hear, but it did mean lost business and that meant someone had to be disciplined. It was the lowest part of my year.\n\nAfter another several weeks of ignoring 15 so more important things could be done, I was instructed by $GM that the issue had to be solved quickly because we were approaching our tournament season and would need every lane we had to be working. I was as discouraged as it was possible to be, since we had replaced every part of the scoring system except for the $CM, which I knew wasn't the cause. But at this point I was out of options, and so I spent an entire 8 hour shift swapping cameras between pairs, calibrating them, testing them, then swapping back and repeating the process over again to be sure they were still usable. I made zero progress, other than to finally have the double cycling problem happen during my testing on game 6. I don't know why it took me 11 games of testing to see the issue myself when everyone else had it as often as multiple times per game, but at least I was able to reproduce it and determine the camera swap had no effect.\n\nAnother week, and another pleasant reminder from $GM that it had to be solved ASAP later, and I found myself back on 15, with a scoring problem that couldn't be solved even by replacing the entire scoring system for that lane. The only thing that hadn't been replaced at this point was the five or six hundred feet of wiring that ran back and forth between all the different modules, so that was my last hope. I remembered seeing the wire bundle leading to the $BD sensors was split open at one spot, so I decided to work on that first. None of the wires inside were damaged however, at least not visually, but the wire was hanging down in the path of the ball as it rolls down from the pinsetters to below the lanes. So, while I was there I decided to clean up some of the loose wires that ran through the area so they wouldn't get damaged by the balls again.\n\nAnd that was when something odd caught my eye. Right where the sloped ball track dips down below the lanes and underneath the $BD, were little fragments and scrapings of bowling balls. It's incredibly frustrating to be unable to find what the cause is when a customer's ball is damaged, so a find like this with a bunch of different colored pieces of ball was rare and noteworthy. I had located an unknown source of ball damage during my futile attempt to fix 15's double cycling. I decided to fix it right then and there, since I was making no progress on the scoring issue. Shining my flashlight down the ball track under the $BD, I could see a brace made of 2x4 and only in place to keep the long boards that ran alongside the gutters the proper distance apart, that looked like it had been attacked with a sledge hammer. It was splintered, beaten, and dislodged, and presumably was the thing the balls were hitting that was causing the damage.\n\nA quick trip to the shop to retrieve the \"test ball\" later and I was able to confirm that every ball traveling down the track to the bowler would just barely hit this wooden brace on the way by. But to my complete shock, when I pushed the ball past it, it pushed the brace and the long board it was mounted to upwards. All of the wooden bracing and \"cribbing\" as it's called between and under the lanes is supposed to be rock solid and not move under any stress short of a very determined sledge hammer. However, the years and years of beatings this brace had endured from bowling balls had broken loose the nails holding down the long board alongside lane 15, allowing it to be pushed upwards with each passing ball. And suddenly, the eureka moment hit me.\n\nThe ball detect mounts to the top of both long boards. Lane 16's long board was still solidly mounted, but 15's wasn't any longer, so whenever a ball pushed its way past it would lift just the one side, tilting the sensors enough that 15's would briefly lose signal and assume a ball had been thrown. It explained everything perfectly. It was so intermittent and random because not every ball would hit the brace hard enough to trigger the $BD. It was only lane 15 because 16's cribbing had not broken loose. Lane 15 would cycle the same amount of time as the time delay later because it really was running through the time delay as if a ball had been thrown.\n\nIt never ceases to amaze me, that with all the capabilities of technology these days and just how much of that capability exists only in a virtual space, that physical forces are often still the cause of our virtual problems. Here I was replacing an entire pair of lanes' worth of scoring equipment due to *an errant piece of wood*. All that was needed to correct the issue was to remove the damaged brace and install a new one in the form of a flat piece of plywood that the ball couldn't hit, then screw back down the long board that had pulled its nails out. In just about an hour of work, I stopped two months worth of headaches and scoring problems with a handsaw and electric screwdriver.\n\nI have no fear of the upcoming takeover of sentient AI and robotic warlords because I know that no matter how sophisticated our technology gets, it will always be vulnerable to simple things like a stray piece of wood.\n\n- - -\n\nEdit: a word\n\nEdit 2: more words",

One of my other skills is around electric vehicles and their control systems, my time is mostly split between these 2 things at work (we do cool electric vehicles).\n\nToday I was borrowed to work on an electric quad for a customer - we have built a fairly badass battery and another company provided motor, controller and gearbox. The team working on the quad had wired up the new battery, but couldnt get it to work and had come to me, the scenario played out a little like this:\n\n&gt; Confirm issue - quad doesnt move, but all the clunks and clicks are at the right time and there should be no reason for it to misbehave\n\n&gt; Troubleshoot (YIBI specialty!)\n\n&gt; Confirm voltage at the back of the battery pack - **YES**\n\n&gt; Confirm voltage at the controller **YES**\n\n&gt; Try and drive quad to see if the voltage colapses **Quad moves**\n\nAfter picking ourselves up off the floor (Yes, we were stood on the quad and it took off rather fast!) We checked again and it still runs...\n\nNot sure how, but the authoratative voice of support seems to have scared another device into working! Does this happen to anyone else??\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have a quad bike to go and ~~thrash the daylights out of around the car park~~ test and evaluate",

The main characters in this story is **$Me** and my **$GrandDad**.\n\nI was visiting my **$GrandDad** and $GrandMum with my $GirlFriend and I wanted to show my **$GrandDad** something online, so I asked to use his computer. \n\n//Begin Rant\n\nJust for a reference on how un-tech savvy my **$GrandDad** is, this machine is still running Windows Vista, and even after his email stopped working (built in MS Email for Vista replaced with thunderbird), and his internet browser (Internet Explorer lord knows what version replace with a version of chrome with adblocker), he still hasn't gotten a new machine.\n\n//End Rant\n\nI am normally the tech support for my Grandparents and I know how I left my **$GrandDad's** PC. When I launch Chrome I see a bunch of tool bars (I don't blame **$GrandDad** I have young cousins who also use the machine) and the home page has been changed to Yahoo something when it should be MSN Sport(was his home page on IE and requested to be changed similarly when I put chrome on). I show my **$GrandDad** the items online and before I closed out I ask him if it was OK to clean up his browser. I go through deleting all the tool bars and additional extensions **$GrandDad** didn't recognize and switch his home page back to MSN Sports.\n\nWhen I was done I gave the PC back to my **$GrandDad** and was about to leave when:\n\n&gt; **$GrandDad** - What did you do to my sports.\n\n&gt; **$Me** - What do you mean, \"What did I do?\"\n\n&gt; **$GrandDad** - You changed it, it looks completely different. There is a bunch of ads that weren't there before and it all looks wrong.\n\nI pause and look at the screen. It has MS's typical tile aesthetic which they have been pushing since Windows 8, the ads are all for MS products and I see nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n&gt; **$Me** - Well **$GrandDad** I unfortunately cannot control how a company chooses how its website layout looks, and even if I wanted change it, I literally cannot.\n\n&gt; **$GrandDad** - Well the website looks fine this morning.\n\n&gt; **$Me** - Maybe it could be the ad-blocker messing around with the website.\n\nI disable the adblocker to see what if it helps.\n\n&gt; **$Me** - How is this?\n\n&gt; **$GrandDad** - Nope still looks wrong.\n\nAt this point I have been getting more and more frustrated the longer I was debugging this issue which, technically did not exist. I even opened IE to verify that the homepage should be MSN Sports, which it was, but that didn't help anything. So I said screw it and started looking through his browser history. If it worked this morning then maybe there will be a web link. I then see a link for Yahoo Sports and it was explored by someone. So I opened up the link.\n\n&gt; **$GrandDad** - There that it. You fixed it.\n\n&gt;$Me - Ummm, this isn't MSN. This is Yahoo.\n\n&gt;$GrandDad - Well what ever this is, this is my sports.\n\nI internally rolled my eyes, and change the homepage back to Yahoo sport. I thanked them for letting us visit and when home. I was just very surprised that his Home page changed and he never noticed, not once. Its like if someone changed your default search engine from Google to Bing and keep calling Bing, Google.\n\nTL:DR Homepage was switched from MSN Sports to Yahoo Sports, and my $GrandDad never notice, I tried to fix it, but had to put it back.",

        "author": "FakerbotRepairman",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/84h37m/tale_from_hardware_featuring_3d_printers/",
        "text": "While I try to keep away from too much technical jargon, this tale is about 3D printers and some jargon is unavoidable.\n\n\nI work at a makerspace/hackerspace as one of two full-time employees and the de-facto guy for fixing anything and everything that breaks, whether it's a computer, laser cutter, or table. My space has about a dozen desktop 3D printers that our members can print models from. Of our printers, we have 5 different brands and models and some are nice to work with while others are just terrible. This printer was one of the terrible ones.\n\n\nThese 3D printers are pretty simple machines. There's what's basically a hot glue gun that gets moved around on X and Y axis and a platform that goes up and down for the Z. Software tells the glue gun head where to go and how much glue to put out. Hardware like endstops and proximity sensors help the machine know where exactly the head is at any time.\n\n\nI will call this printer the FakerBot Defecator and my space had a second generation of this thing. The issue was a terrible grinding noise when the printer first started and tried to home its axis. Other than that grinding noise the machine worked fine. I took it off its shelf and onto a workbench and poked around a bit, finding a problem with its X axis endstop.\n\n\nThis endstop is really just a strip of spring steel that gets pushed onto a contact to complete a circuit when the printer head bumps is. The now-closed circuit sends a signal to the printer control that tells it to stop, or it will continue to run against the printer frame and make an awful grinding noise. Problem = isolated.\n\n\nNow it would be a simple fix to just replace the endstop if I had one lying around the shop. I had endstops, just not *mechanical* endstops. I had optical endstops. These work by shining a weak laser between to points to complete a circuit. When something (like the printer head) passes through that laser and blocks the beam and opens the circuit, the printer computer gets a signal to stop the print head.\n\n\nThere's a subtle difference there that I want to make sure is known. Mechanical endtop = stop on circuit close. Optical endstop = stop on circuit open. They are opposite of each other.\n\n\nSo I go ahead and install the optical endstop and make sure that it sends proper signal to the computer. Of course, the print head will only move if I have my hand in the laser path of the optical endstop, but I figure I can fix that in software....\n\n\nMany 3D printers use firmware that is open-source or based on open-source. In this firmware, there's a line defining a boolean variable to invert endstop signal. I would, in theory, need to change:\n\n\n     X_ENDSTOP_INVERT=FALSE\n\n\nto:\n\n\n    X_ENDSTOP_INVERT=TRUE\n\n\nEasy! But FakerBot Defecator printers don't use open source firmware! In fact, you can't even flash an open-source firmware because they use their own proprietary motherboard. So I had to either make or buy a mechanical endstop. I go to the online FakerBot store and see that they are selling a single mechanical endstop for $10 + $7 in shipping. While I love spending my boss's money, I not only didn't want to pay for shipping, but I also didn't want to give FakerBot another goddamn penny. So I found compatible endstops elsewhere online, 5 for $10 with free shipping. \n\n\nOnce I popped the new mechanical endstops in, the printer worked just about as well as a printer could. And the shop has more spare parts for when the Defecator eventually craps out again. I would love to keep going on about how FakerBot printers don't share the common file type as other printers, require their own special software to print and manage from, or even how you have to make an online account to use that special software. I'll save those for another post.",

LargeAntivirus allows you to set up users to log in to the web console using AD credentials.  \n\nLast week, I went to set up a new tech's login and discovered my AD integration ... wasn't integrating.  \n\nI poked, prodded, reset services, checked permissions, and nothing worked.  I opened a case with LargeAntivirus and set up a meeting today with a tech to fix it.\n\nTech remotes in and checks my setup.  Nope, I'm set up correctly.  He checks to make sure LargeAntivirus is up to date - yup, all good.  He checks to make sure there aren't any AD issues with the recent hotfix I had just installed.  We set up a new service account with a different encryption for the antivirus to authenticate with AD.  We restarted the services on the AV control server.\n\nThen we opened the web console in IE.  I normally use Chrome.  Up popped the shiny option to create an AD-linked account.\n\nThe tech immediately dove into his own system to figure out what conflict could exist with AD integration and Chrome.  He'd never seen it refuse to work in Chrome before - in fact, they recommend using Chrome-  and mine is completely updated to the most recent release, I'm not running some strange beta build or outdated version.\n\nThen I noticed uBlock origin was enabled.  Checked, nope, not blocking anything, but... why not disable it anyway?\n\nBam.  AD account creation screen.\n\nTech and I stared at the web console, and neither of us said anything for a moment.  We were almost an hour deep into troubleshooting at this point.  He took control of my system, turned uBlock back on, reloaded.  Then turned it off, reloaded.  \"Huh,\" he said.  \"Let's ... let's just call this solved and walk away, yes?\"\n\nHe was grateful that we had gotten to the root of the problem, and now the documentation will be updated to note issues with Chrome addons.  I promised to leave him a good review for being helpful.  But there's nothing like the shared, shameful silence when two admins realize they've been idiots...",

I am entering $password.\n\n&gt;$me: _Reset the password to something new, less characters in an attempt to be user friendly_\n\n&gt;$me: Okay, I've changed it again, can you try $password please.\n\n&gt;$Cli: This still isn't working! I'm sick of this! \n\nAt this point I'm confused, I've logged into her VM from my machine and it's logging me in fine. So I ask to get a remote session into her local machine to double check everything. Ask her to enter the password I have given her and realize she's written both passwords down in a notepad. Each password I generated had a _W_ in it, and she has written them down as _UU_, even after saying \"W for Whiskey\" over the phone to her. Instead of potentially embarrassing her or igniting her anger more about the situation I just entered the password, made her create a new one, to which I was still given shit over the phone by her on \"how difficult\" the situation had been to deal with and impacted her ability to work for that 15 minutes. Assuming she can even use Word.\n\ntl;dr: \nUser password expired, reset, they can't get it to work, reset again, still doesn't work. Log into machine, they're entering \"w\" as \"uu\". ",

A temp worker put a bunch of data on a memory stick and took it home! You need to tell us what files she took!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Well, we may or may not be able to tell that right away..\"\n\n&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: \"This is important! $CluelessCFO is having a hard time managing this temp!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"And this is a technical problem how?\"\n\n&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: \"Well, she shouldn't have been able to take those files home!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Agreed. But when we suggested disabling the front USB ports on all your PCs to inhibit USB memory sticks, you said that wasn't appropriate. BTW, remember when we suggested to you that as part of your HIPAA compliance policy that you limit/restrict the use of memory sticks? And set a policy about employee data handling?

I can't make someone do their work with the computer if their supervisor can't manage them.\"\n\nAfter a couple minutes, it comes out that this \"temp\" in the Finance Department was new. $CluelessNonProfit never told us they had a temp coming in. Instead of calling us to set up a network account for the temp, they just had her using the account of a finance employee who had just retired (who they never told us had retired, either).  Oh, but look, in a neato turn of events, the person that retired is still \"occasionally doing work\" for them so she logs in with her old ID as well as the temp. \n\nHoly audit trail, Batman.\n\nThis is the same $CluelessNonProfit where, during a visit to the office, the $ExecutiveDirector tried to tell me that as their IT support organization, $BigBossCompany would be their \"HIPAA compliance officer.\" \n\n&gt;\"Nope, thats not how it works,\" I said.\n\nAfter 10 minutes talking to the $ExecutiveDirector, it was clear she had no idea exactly what the HIPAA requirements even were. She thought it was all technical stuff like passwords and firewalls. When I started talking about $CluelessNonProfit's in-house HIPAA policies, auditing, enforcement, employee training, etc, she got this blank look and said \"I just want to be HIPAA compliant...\"\n\nBut the bottom line was that the $CluelessCFO was incapable of managing people as well as finances.\n\n[Edit: Swapped HIPPA for HIPAA.

This time he had called in as was tasked with making a cocktail menu for a restaurant.\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n$C: Okay so here is all the menu items, how do I get them into a word document?\n\n$Me: Okay so all you have to do is click and drag to select all the menu items and then either right click and copy or CTRL+C\n\n*I copy everything over to the word file but the formatting isn't the greatest with the transfer from email*\n\n$Me: Okay so as you can see all the data has been added to the word document.\n\n$C: Yeah, but it doesn't look very good, can you spruce it up for me as its supposed to be printed for a menu.\n\n*knowing full well Its in my right to deny this request I was a bit too smug at this point*\n\n$Me: That's not really in the scope of our work, I can show you a few editing tools but I am not really a designer myself so I wouldn't know what looks good.\n\n*I end up showing him how to resize text and change the alignment and how to move pictures on a word document*\n\n$Me: Okay then with those should hopefully be able to create a good menu, I have logged out of your machine and hope you have a good day!\n\n*I had a look later he tried calling in again 10 minutes later and tried again only to get the same answer*\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n \n",

We can't get on the internet or the cloud (cloud is what we call our internal terminal server farm hosted at head office, this site is remote) help!\n\n&gt;D: Right ok, is it all of you? Can you get on the Internet normally? On your phones things like that?\n\n&gt;U: No, nothing is working, all the phones are off (they're VoIP).\n\n&gt;D: Ok, remember the server cupboard, go in there and find the white box with \"Draytek\" on top, flick the power switch at the back, give it a few seconds and flick it back.\n\nCommence the rummaging of mobile phones and things, I start pinging devices over at this site but no responses, after a few minutes I get responses but very bad response stats.\n\n&gt;U: Hey D, that's done, I still can't get on. \n\nIt's about 17:15 at this point, 15 minutes till closing, I know the user doesn't care at this point either, it'll take me 45 minutes+ to get to site.\n\n&gt;D: Right OK, nothing's changed over there has it around the time it went wrong? I've checked the service status and seems well with the ISP but I'll call them in a second.\n\n&gt;U: No nothing has changed, just all went off.\n\n&gt;D: Right ok, I'll call the ISP and be over first thing tomorrow morning.\n\nI call the ISP (BT) and report the issue, no issues according to them, they blame faulty equipment internally, usual response.\n\nCommence the next day, I drive to site and get in the office, immediately met with a rearranged office, at this point I figured out I was lied to.\n\n&gt;D: When did the office get moved around?\n\n&gt;U: Yesterday afternoon, why?\n\n&gt;D: Around the time you had issues?\n\n&gt;U: Yes...why?\n\n&gt;D: No reason...\n\nFigured I'd get ammunition to fire at this user before doing anything, I head to the server room and see the Draytek flashing all it's LAN ports in unison, perfect example of a broadcast storm, I reboot the Draytek just for the fun of it, it comes back, same issue.\n\nI head to the now desktop switch in the other room. User is sat there on her phone without a care in the world, sure enough this switch is also showing signs of a storm, I reboot it (for the lols) and it comes back the same.\n\nWhile I'm tracing the cables, user pipes up.\n\n&gt;U: Do you know what it is?\n\n&gt;D: I think you rearranging the office has caused it, think the cables have been plugged in wrongly.\n\n&gt;U: But we didn't touch that? *points at the switch*\n\n&gt;D: Ok...\n\nI trace the cables back to the culprit, our VoIP phones have one port for the LAN and a second RJ45 to feed your PC off the phone, both of these ports were plugged into the switch, unplugged the one that should be going to a PC and voila, it worked fine again. \n\n&gt;U: Oh it's working again!\n\nAt this point I'm losing my patience, which doesn't happen that often.\n\n&gt;D: Right, good. The problem was this phone had two cables going into it, one of them was plugged in wrong. This doesn't just happen so someone must have done it when you rearranged the office yesterday. \n\n&gt;U: I told you, we didn't touch that box!\n\nThe aggressive response kind of tells me all I need to know, I go chat with the handyman who helped do the heavy lifting of desks and things, someone I trust to tell the truth more. He backs me up saying that the User plugged in the cables into that box after moving everything around.\n\nThe User in question is the one I've been talking to who \"Never touched the box\" but she is always looking out for herself and thinks she's invincible because she's \"friends\" with the boss.\n\n&gt;D: Right U, I know the cables were moved, when this problem happens, it happens instantly most of the time, it doesn't take time to happen, so you, or someone else plugged the cables in. Nobody knew you were rearranging the office and you lied when I asked if anything had changed yesterday.\n\n&gt;U: But...\n\n&gt;D: I won't take it any further, but next time you want to rearrange the office, call me first. I don't mind coming to move the IT equipment, it's what I'm here for.\n\n&gt;U: Ok...\n\n&gt;D: And if you didn't move the cables then the other User2 or User3 did, so just make them aware, yeah?\n\n&gt;U: Yeah...OK...\n\nI left site feeling fairly good all things considered, I'm almost 99% sure that User is the one that moved the cables around, with how defensive they were. I'm almost tempted to view the CCTV we have internally just to prove that point...\n\nTL;DR - User rearranged office, user lied when asked about change, broadcast storm brought User and two others to a standstill.

Because the database conversion is a long process, we will be providing a read-only environment for the week before go-live. This lets us not worry about data changes at the last moment, and still lets the bulk of work get done, since most of it is just looking up stuff.\n\nThe announcement had two key points:\n\n* In the **Details** section, I mentioned that we shut down on XX March, and we'll have a read-only environment available, ending with this: \"You will be able to login as normally, but you will not be able to make any changes. If you have changes you must make before YY April, you must complete them before XX March; on that day, you will be prevented from making changes on the $software until after the upgrade is complete.\"\n\n* In the **Action Required By You** section, there's this: \"If you have any planned changes to $software's data that must occur during the first $number days of April, schedule them to happen before XX March, or after YY April.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo today I get copied on a reply that said: \"Does this $software upgrade mean that the $software will not allow document changes or release activity from XX March thru YY Apr?\"\n\nWhy...yes. Yes. That's *exactly* what it means. Well done. Here's a gold star.\n",

They exaggerate about the length, saying it draws out for 3 seconds. False. No one else has validated that, in fact the opposite; it actually plays back an audio file of a set length and everyone says it plays for 'about __', AKA the length that the file. $user is literally the only person that does not like it.\n\nThey have whined and complained and nagged me once a week at least asking me if I've fixed it yet. They have done the same to their managers, to the point where the managers are asking me about fixing it for $user's sake (in other words, to get $user to shut up about it)\n\nOur PBX is a specific version for compatibility purposes, the catch being that paging announcements are very difficult to modify. This freaking $user is escalating a non-issue to the point of completely rebuilding the PBX from scratch, having to jury-rig non-compatible components, all in the name of something that only bothers them.\n\nAlso, the announcement beep is actually a good thing because it keeps users from having the front of their page cut off because they started talking too soon. I can pretty much guarantee you that within a week of it actually being changed, they will ask me to change it back. \n\nThe struggle is real.",

        "text": "Here's a fun story I just finished working through. Not related to my actual job, but a \"friend of the family\" type deal.  \n  \n**Cast and Crew**\n$Me: A plucky frying pan, played secretly by a wok  \n$Friend: Family friend and worker at $PopsShop, as portrayed by Keanu Reeves  \n$Cuz: $Friend's cousin and business manager for $PopsShop. Played by Scarlett Johansson  \n$Pop: Owner of $PopsShop and father of $Friend. He'll be played by Danny DeVito  \n$Bro: $Friend's brother, \"admin\" for $PopsShop's infrastructure. Played by Tom Hiddleston Thanks [liquidivy](https://www.reddit.com/user/liquidivy) for pointing that out.\n  \n**Setting**  \n$Me is at home, while everyone else is at $PopsShop  \n  \n**Act 1**  \nOur story begins with a text message while $Me is at lunch.  \n&gt;$Friend: Can you give me a call? I've got a computer question.  \n  \n*Great, here goes half my lunch time. Calls*  \n  \n&gt;$Me: Hey $Friend. How's it going?  \n&gt;*extra pleasantries cut for brevity*  \n&gt;$Friend: What do you know about $EmailSuite? \n&gt;$Me: *somewhat suspicious* Not much, really. What's the problem?  \n&gt;$Friend: I went to log in and my email doesn't work. $Pop and $Cuz can't get in either. We reached out to $Search about it, but they can't do anything without the admin credentials. $Bro has those, but he's out of the country.  \n&gt;$Me: Ok. I'm not sure what else I can do to help.  \n&gt;$Friend: Our website is also down. We tried to get a hold of $Candle, the website design place, but same story. We have $EmailSuite through them, so maybe that's the issue.  \n&gt;$Me: Hmm...well, let me see what I can find.  \n&gt;$Friend: Thanks. We really need to update the admin accounts anyway, since $Bro hasn't worked here in over a year.  \n  \nAnd so, I ventured out to start doing some research. Honestly, my thought was that their subscription card had expired and no one had updated it. If $Bro hadn't been there in over a year, likely no one was getting the emails that it needed updated, and the account was disabled. So, I started digging into the sites.  \n  \nFirst, I needed to get into $Candle. Now, to reset the admin account fully, you need two things.  \n1. You need the ID of the registrant for the domain  \n2. You need a copy of the business license if it's a corporate domain  \n  \nApparently, the domain was registered by a contractor who initially created the website and domain for $PopsShop, and had been registered through $StopMomma. Fortunately, that was the one set of credentials that $Friend had, so I started there. I updated the registrant information to myself, and I reached out to $Cuz for a copy of the business license.  \n  \nAfter a few days for the changes to settle, I went to $Candle and updated the admin account. Success! I put in the new card information that I got from $Cuz and restarted the site. After talking with $Friend, however, they still didn't have email. So, I had to go to $Search to try and get the $EmailSuite credentials reset.  \n  \n**Intermision**  \nPlease take a moment to go and get a snack in the lobby  \n  \n**Act 2**  \nWe re-enter the scene with $me trying to reset the $EmailSuite credentials. Fortunately, I have access to $Candle and $StopMomma, because to reset the admin credentials for $EmailSuite requires setting up a CNAME entry that redirects to a specific location in $Search. That way, they know you actually own the domain in question.  \n  \nAfter much back and forth, the following conversation with $Support (Cameo appearance by Stan Lee):  \n&gt;$Support: It appears that the CNAME redirects aren't working. Are there any other accounts that we could transfer admin right to?  \n&gt;$Me: Can you try $Cuz@domain or $Friend@domain? They're the main folks I'm working with.  \n&gt;$Support: Hmm. It appears that those accounts have been deleted.  \n&gt;$Me: *Cogs start creaking slowly* Were any other accounts deleted?  \n&gt;$Support: No, just those 3.  \n&gt;$Me: *Cogs slowly speeding up* When were they deleted?  \n&gt;$Support: &lt;Date that is two days before $Friend first contacted me&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: *Cogs at full speed now* And the only one who could do that was the admin?  \n&gt;$Support: Correct. We could do it as well, but that would require the admin to contact us.  \n&gt;$Me: Ok. I think I'm getting the picture here. Can the accounts be recovered?  \n&gt;$Support: Not at this time. Those accounts have gone too stale.  \n&gt;$me: Gotcha. Could we completely delete the $EmailSuite account and essentially restart fresh?  \n&gt;$Support: We can do that. I'll get you a different redirect link to try. This one usually works a bit easier than the automated reset. If that works, we can completely remove the old account and you can create a new one.  \n  \nGreat. I had a new process to take. But first, I had to call $Friend.  \n&gt;$Friend:  Hey $Me, how's it going? Any word?  \n&gt;$Me: Hey $Friend. I spoke with $Search. I have good news, bad news, and worse news. The good news is that we can get your email accounts back.  \n&gt;$Friend: And the bad news?  \n&gt;$Me: We have to completely remove the old accounts and recreate them. Any data that was attached to them is gone and cannot be recovered.  \n&gt;$Friend: That sucks, but it is what it is. At least we can get back the emails we use to do business. What's the worse news?  \n&gt;$Me: The only way for the accounts to be deleted was for $Bro to delete them.  \n&gt;$Friend: I thought that might be the case. Let me tell you something.  \n  \nAs it turns out, when $Bro left the company, he wasn't taken off as a signator for the company checking account. He took tens of thousands of dollars out of the account over the last year, and was finally told he was being taken off those accounts...a week before all the troubles started.  \n  \n**Finale**  \nAnd so, we reach the climax of our production. The villain has been revealed, and the hero fights valiantly to finish saving the domain. The delete link worked for $EmailSuite and we were able to recreate the necessary accounts. Business could return and the realm was saved once again! That is, until the villain reached his arm out of the fiery pit for one final blow.  \n  \nI got an email a couple days after deleting the ole $EmailSuite from $StopMomma, saying that they wanted to update the registrant information from my name to $Bro. Fortunately, I can stop those sorts of things, and his last shot was ended. Slowly, he finished sinking into the pit, defeated for today.\n\n\n\n**Afterparty  Edits**  \nThere were some questions of repayment. $Friend did say he wanted me to track hours and put together a bill for @PopsShop, because, in his words \"If I had to do this in my off time, I would expect to get paid for it.\"  \n  \nAs far as I know, no legal recourse has been taken against $Bro. He is somewhat estranged now, so I don't think this helped that relationship.  \n  \n$Friend and $Cuz have agreed that no individual user should ever have all the admin access to his or herself. \n",

The computer in our office doesn't work.\n\n&gt;$Me: May I ask you to describe to me what's happening?\n\n&gt;$Nurse: I push the power button and the green light comes on, but nothing happens. I just have a black picture.\n\nSo I went through the standard procedure of \"Have you tried turning it off and on again?\" and had her check for any obvious loose cables and so on. I even asked her to unplug the power-strip from the wall and plug it back in, since I had a similar case before where a computer constantly froze during boot and unplugging the power somehow helped. But that didn't work either.\n\nSo I decided to come to her office and check, thinking it might be the GPU or something. Upon arrival, I asked her to demonstrate:\n\n&gt;$Me: Can you please show me what you were doing and explain the problem again?\n\n&gt;$Nurse: Look. I push the power button (*pushes the power button*) and the green light comes on (*green power indicator lights up*) but nothing else happens.\n\nAnd indeed, the screen stayed black.\n\nOnly thing is, she pushed the power button of the (old and clunky CRT) monitor. But nothing else.\n\nSo I reached under the table and turned on the actual computer and immediately, we could see the boot sequence on the screen and the nurse asked me bewildered:\n\n&gt;$Nurse: What did you do with that box under the desk?\n\n&gt;$Me: Oh, someone seemed to have forgotten to turn it back on. That one is needed too for the computer to work.\n\nAnd she nodded understandingly and we both went about our businesses again.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR** Nurse is so used to turning on *just* the monitor (since they just leave the computer running all the time) that she doesn't know it's only the monitor, and the actual computer is under the desk.",

Please keep in mind I don't know this guy at all and still don't know his name till this day.\n\nIt's about 8 o clock in the morning and my shift doesn't start till 09:00.
