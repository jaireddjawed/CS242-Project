        "text": "This might interest someone. TRASH and water features!!! I have been, until recently, a street sweeper. One of the things I have noticed is that some urban developments in my city have a water features consisting of a cascading pool. Water is pumped from the bottom of the pool to the top in a closed loop, a grill at the lower end stops debris going into the catch tank and into the pump. Around the feature is usually a six to eight-inch high coping. Discarded trash and fallen leaves, dust etc., blow around the street and occasionally into the water feature.  Most of the trash will collect in areas of low pressure like fire door alcoves, street gutters etc, but also areas that are wet. the problem I see is coping prevents the aerial flotsam from entering the water feature. I think that the removal of the coping on the water feature-perhaps having a soft edge instead of a hard edge would allow the trash to deliberately collect in the pond and be collected in the grill. Any biodegradable material would decay negating its immediate removal, plastic and dirt would remain. This would result in a much cleaner and less labour intensive built environment - Water features designed to collect trash.\nyour thoughts?\n Here is one   -33.900230°  151.213517°\n And another  -33.885907°  151.200214°",

(high cost of living in Paris makes me a bit wary as well.\n \nAs for regions, I'm most interested in Latin America. This is partly why I am attracted to the Sciences Po degree, combined with the fact that it is a prestigious university and would give me the chance to study in Paris, as well as work on my French. However, debt is a concern. \n\n\nAny thoughts? Thanks!",

So the majority of jobs are spread out between the 2 downtown centers and the Research Triangle Park. (separated by 15-30 miles each way)\n\nThat being said - are there any pros to spreading out employment centers like this as opposed to having everything downtown or in a centralized location? Obviously there seems to be a lot of cons as it makes it harder to plan for non-vehicular travel.",

It would be great if someone could tell me about recent cases of this so that I can look for any article or piece of news  for my research.\n\nI'm from Argentina so I'm sorry if my English isn't perfect, as it isn't my first language.\n\nHope you have a great day.\n\nI aplogize if this post doesn't belong here",
