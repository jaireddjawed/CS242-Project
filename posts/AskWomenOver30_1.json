The problem is when I’ve finished work I’m exhausted, I feel like when I’m not at work I’m recovering from being at work. Can anyone else relate? If you don’t relate what would you recommend I do to create a better balance. It’s also not easy for me to switch out of work mode once I’m home either and its such a struggle trying to juggle everything, chores, social life, self care, dates etc when I’m so burnt out from work. Feel free to share your stories so I can get inspired, would be very much appreciated! I am struggling",

        "text": "For the last bit I’ve been thinking a lot about why so many people on Reddit believe in the brain development at 25 myth and why they get so angry about strangers getting married before they’re 35 or so.\n\nAn okay source for explaining the myth: https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/brain-development-25-year-old-mature-myth.html\n\nI have been married for 20 years. My husband and I were both 21 when we got married. 18 when we started dating.\n\nYesterday my husband said he was talking to two coworkers who were also in long term relationships. He said they both got together when they younger than us, like both the other couples started dating in high school. One has three kids and the other is childfree like us. He said they talked about how all three of them were glad they found their person early and that dating seems horrible now.\n\nSo I was thinking about it, and I remember seeing someone on here saying that when you’re under 25 you still depend on your parents and they pay for your life if you need it. That is not our experience, lol.\n\nSo I said “Do you think maybe it’s that upper middle class white people stay immature longer than the rest of us?”\n\nHe said his two coworkers definitely did not fit into that demographic. I know a majority of Reddit does, especially the loudest voices. Ask me how I know, with the reaction when I try to talk about growing up working class and my father dying when I was 7.\n\nMy husband’s mother died when he was 17. He’s the oldest of five, and his father was severely bipolar. He brought up that when we were 27, we bought our house and his youngest sister moved in with us a couple weeks later because their father’s house wasn’t livable. She lived with us for her high school career.\n\nSo…yeah. The arguments I read here about not getting married in your early 20s don’t apply to my life at all.\n\nSo I was wondering - what were your early 20s like? How did your position in our social hierarchy affect that period in your life? Did you have stable parents you could depend on to bail you out or not? How do you feel the conditions of your life informed your mental and emotional development?\n\nOh, this morning I googled and found sources to support my intuition that more privileged people mature at a slower rate.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3172314/\n\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4234039/",

Other than using them for pictures to flirt with the girls he cheated on me with.\n\nMy dogs were the children I never had while married. They have been with me throughout the most difficult times, helped me with the grief of divorce, and just overall helped me stay afloat and survive.\n\nI never thought I’d be in this situation- alone (I don’t have family in the US and my circle of friends is small and spread all over). \n\nMy new job is now requiring me to travel frequently and my expenses with pet sitting/house sitting have become unsustainable.\n\nI am in tech sales, and I am terrified of layoffs too. My last resort would be sending my dogs to my home country to stay with my mom. It will be cheaper for me to help with upkeep, and I know they will be in great hands plus I’ll also get to see them when I visit…but I just feel like a failure for not honoring their lives and keeping them until the very end. \n\nIf you ever had to give up on your pet, how did you deal with the guilt?",

In my current job I spend most of my time working alone and my colleagues were not particularly sociable. I also moved to a new town in the last year, so I have ended up very isolated. I am excited for the new job as it seems much more sociable, but I am worried that I have become even more shy and awkward in the last year than I already was. Both my old job and my new job are remote, which makes getting to know colleagues more difficult. \n\nEssentially, I am worried that I have forgotten how to build relationships after a year of feeling isolated at home and at work. I am scared this may end up in me feeling similarly isolated in my new job. How can I get off to a better start in my new role? \n\nAs a side note, I am also trying to be more sociable out of work, but ultimately I also need socialization in work. Spending 40+ hours a week in my home office with only occasional conversations with colleagues has worn me down. I would prefer an in-person job, but that is not an option for me for the next few years.",

We both worked  full time and had some serious problems dumped on us by his family, but  worked through most of them.\n\nThere  were some leftover problems the largest of which was sex only occurred  when he initiated, and once a month was the most frequent. Two months  ago he asked me why I never initiated sex. I reminded him we discussed  this decades ago in counseling, and I had stopped a long time before  that because it was insane for me to try when he said no for a decade.  He mulled this over for a while, and came back and asked if I could  initiate because he felt bad being the only person doing that.\n\nI  was excited because I had long ago given up on this.  So I set up a  romantic dinner date at home, something delicious but not heavy. After  dinner he 'stretched out for just a minute' and fell heavily asleep. I  had a bottle of champagne chilled because he enjoys a glass or two  before. I tried to wake him up gently, but gave up as I became more  disillusioned.\n\nFinally went to bed and he woke up sometime shortly afterward and tried to restart, but I was done.\n\nFor the first time I do not feel anything towards him. I do not want him to touch me. I am not angry, or even sad.\n\nWe  have an extended trip scheduled. I want to do this because it has been a  life long dream of mine. I have told him I will complete the currently  promised plans, then we are done.\n\nHe has been begging me to forgive him, and has asked what he can do to fix this. My answer has been 'nothing'.\n\nI have given up so much in our relationship for decades. And I crazy for being done with my marriage this late in life?",

I also have pain in my left ovary, frequent urination, I'm tired all the time, and in general I just don't feel well.\nI had a pap smear that came back normal and they did a transvaginal ultrasound and found a 6 cm complex cyst in my left ovary (a complex cyst Is different from those that develop in a normal cycle or from pcos) .

I want to know if we're on the same page about our future, but I'm afraid to ask because I'm scared of hearing an answer I don't want. Worse, I'm afraid of hearing a \"biding more time\" answer that doesn't really give me clarity. \n\nI feel like he's not including me in his plans, and it's hard to tell if it's just my negative thinking or a reaction to reality. We currently live together in an apartment and he talks about purchasing property by himself, using \"I\" terms rather than \"we\" terms. While he always checks in and shows me the property, I don't really feel important or considered since he hasn't mentioned how I fit into he equation or made it seem like a \"we\" thing. The reality is I would never feel comfortable living as a tenant in a house he purchased, and I would only purchase a property if I was married to him. I do want to be married but I obviously want to establish common goals, etc. Among other big questions like marriage, etc. how can I approach this conversation in a way that doesn't put him on the spot, but still gives me the clarity I need to feel confident about our future together? \n\nHas anyone else gone through a similar situation? How did you approach it, and what was the outcome? I don't want to end the relationship, but I also don't want to be strung along.",

It was a chaotic time and I wasn't doing well mentally. Now, my friend had told me that they would be very busy with work during this week in particular so I tried to be less demanding. However, around about the 5th day I was starting to feel crazy lonely and began to wonder if they were intentionally avoiding me. So, I sent another message asking to talk, but didn't really phrase it the best. I was kinda in meltdown mode. Feeling self-conscious and alone.\n\nThey snapped at me pretty hard that they were annoyed that I was bothering them so much when they were busy and that they couldn't be the person to help with my mental health. That they had a life outside of the internet. It felt really harsh at the time since I legitimately thought that they might be there for me. Sure, we had become friends online, but all friendships start somewhere right?\n\nIt's been a few days since then and we haven't spoken. They haven't apologized to me about snapping at me, but I do feel like I contributed a bit to the issue. I'm sure I was causing extra stress to their already stressful week so I think I should apologize, but it did seem awfully harsh to someone already in a bad place. Either way, I won't be relying on them any further, but maybe an apology could help bring things back to congenial?",

Maybe you’ve had a similar dynamic with a friend and you might have some advice or helpful words. \n\nHave any of you had a friend that you essentially only talk to online. A friend who you once saw often but circumstances made that change and now you only speak on social media? \n\nThat’s what’s happening for me. \n\nThis friend was very helpful when I was in a dire time of my life. She was my life line and I felt very grateful for that. I showed her I appreciated her trying to take her to nice outings (she didn’t drive due to medical reasons). I just had no one else I could turn to for a few years. \n\nDuring that time she seemed a little possessive or jealous of the guy I was hanging out with. She didn’t like him and it was awkward. But I made sure I gave them both my time and friendship. \n\nLater on as her housing situation changed I could no longer visit her like I used to. I wanted to but it wasn’t possible. So that’s when things changed to a more online thing. \n\nOver the years we’ve had countless conversations online and then the pandemic hit and she was high risk so I didn’t see her for maybe 3 years in person. \n\nI found this a bit hard. Because i had essentially forgotten who she was in real life. \n\nBecause of the medical issues she was very outspoken and angry during the pandemic and I didn’t want to get involved. I had my own health issues to with. \n\nFor the last two years I’ve felt this hot and cold, push and pull feeling that I’m struggling to understand. \n\nSometimes it feels like I can’t connect on a authentic level. If I share something I feel or believe I get what seems like a passive aggressive energy back. If I share my accomplishments (gardening, cooking, art) there’s little acknowledgment or encouragement. \n\nSo I pull away and keep to myself and then out of the blue she will suddenly be interested in my life, chatty, friendly and kind. So I open up again authentically and soon enough I feel like I’ve said too much.  \n\nI know I can set boundaries or end the friendship. I know all those things. But what I don’t understand is why it’s become like this. Someone said she might be jealous. But I’m not showing off I just try to be my genuine self. \n\nI guess I’ve come to see her as inauthentic and I feel she might speak about me behind my back. I just don’t trust her anymore. Am I being paranoid? I have asked her how she feels about me and she says everything is fine. But then I’ll get the cold energy. \n\nI can’t have unauthorised people in my life. I just smell insincerity a mile away",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/11rfhlk/the_battle_between_selfattacks_and_taking/",
        "text": "Sorry for that wordy title - I am not sure how best to summarize. I have followed this community for a while and found the insights offered by you ladies to be invaluable. I am looking to see if some of you can relate to a challenge I am having as I exit a relationship and try to figure out who I am as a 33-year-old woman.\n\nThroughout my childhood and my adult life, I have had a lot of anxiety around other people. I could hardly speak to strangers up until I got to university, where I was sort of forced out of my shell. In the years after I graduated uni and got my first job, then some promotions, I felt that I found my voice and was comfortable existing in the world, even if I often still worried. I think I felt confident enough in myself that those thoughts could pop into my head but I could shake them off.\n\nAt one point in my life pre-pandemic, I had gotten pretty good at letting intrusive negative thoughts pop into my head but then disregarding them. It was like I was in a glass case, and I could see the negative thoughts coming toward me, but I could just say \"hello, no need for you here\" as they hit the glass and then I could dismiss the thoughts. Life wasn't perfect, but I had come into my own.\n\nIn recent months, I have accepted that I developed some problems regulating my emotions in the last couple years (long story), and I'm trying to figure out how I can calm myself down and have better relationships with others and myself. Cutting alcohol out of my life is a first step I am taking. I feel out of control, and I know the burden is on me to figure out how I can be a better part of this world. But as I explore new ideas for how to exist, I find myself worrying that I am just \"tricking\" myself or willfully putting my bad qualities out of mind. Some examples:\n\n1. My new therapist has been catching me in \"self-attacks\" as she asks me questions about my life and experiences. (In particular, this is in the context of a long-term romantic relationship that recently ended quite badly, with anger on both sides. I came to this therapist seeking help for anger management because of my experience in that relationship.) I find myself caught between the awareness that I really am blaming and attacking myself for everything, but also, I know I had significant culpability in some of the issues. How do I balance the need to stop \"self-attacking\" with my desire to examine things I might have done wrong or badly? I worry about being \"let off the hook\" if I can't explain the things I did, even though they are self-attacks and therefore must be problematic...?\n2. I've also recently been exploring restorative yoga. I find myself relaxed at the end of a session but also wondering \"if I practice these meditative things, am I just tricking myself into feeling calm?\" Am I suppressing chaos inside myself that will come back to bite me later?\n3. I have similar thoughts as I google \"how to stop making assumptions.\" I feel that I jump to conclusions and assume things about how others are thinking or feeling about me, whether in work or in friend/family relationships. I need to get a handle on that. But if I try to stop my brain's way of looking for patterns and assuming things (usually assuming the worst), how do I know when my sense that something is bad is based in reality? How do I avoid overthinking OR thinking too little?\n\nI guess I am worried I will train myself to react to nothing, to let my assumptions pop into my head but remind myself to ignore them, etc. and then find myself out of touch with myself and reality. I'm worried I'm going to numb myself and then one day suddenly explode. That I won't actually heal at all.\n\nHave you ever found yourself caught in this sort of thinking pattern? Even if not, is there some perspective you see that I am just completely ignoring? \n\nTruly, I am ashamed of my past actions and feel ready to make a sincere effort to change. I have come to believe that compassion and love for the self is the best foundation from which to give genuine compassion and love to others. But I don't want to convince myself that I am acceptable just as I am now. If you have any advice for how to escape this fear, overanalysis, or whatever else this is, I will greatly appreciate it.",

        "text": "Hello everyone!   \n\nSo for the last 3 years, I’ve (29f) been in a relationship with a guy I knew years ago. Back when I first met him, I was pretty much the “annoying kid” that came around. (A little back story, I was 13 and all of my friends with the exception of my best friend, were older than me. He was 19 at the time.) I know what you’re thinking.. what is a 19 year old guy doing hanging out with a 13 year old child? It wasn’t like that. All of my friends that were older than me (15,16,17 at the time) hung around with him and his friends, and I was just kind of a tag along.   \n\nAnywho, he had gotten into a relationship with a woman his age (she was about 2 months older than him I believe). She made him get rid of all of the younger kids that hung around (myself included) and all females that hung around (yea, she’s one of those. She HATED other females). Not even a year into their relationship.. she got pregnant. Their daughter was born October 2009. Here’s where things get interesting. I learned over the years that she dated most of his friends and one even told me that she tried to use him to have a kid. The way he described it to me was “oh we were having sex one day and she told me not to pull out. I IMMEDIATELY pulled out of her, put my clothes on, and left. We broke up shortly after that.” Come to find out, that’s all she wanted from the man I’m currently dating. She wanted to have a child, and get taken care of. I’ve spoken to his sister and she’s told me some interesting things..   \n\n1. “They got into a full out brawl because he confronted her about spending rent money on marijuana and her REFUSING to get a job despite having the baby to support.”   \n\n2. “They beat the shit out of each other on a fairly regular basis. She had no qualms about literally twisting his testicles or punching him in the face if he made her mad or upset her.”   \n\nSometime later, I believe their daughter was 5 at the time and they had already went their separate ways. He got into an altercation with his mother (what the exact reason is, I have no idea. I’ve heard a few different things) and he ended up pointing a gun at her (I’d also like to make it known that his mother was EXTREMELY abusive to him as both a child and an adult). He went to jail for it and the mother of his daughter used this incident to terminate his parental rights. Which, don’t get me wrong, I probably would have done the same thing. He hasn’t seen her since before he went to jail. But before this whole thing with his mother happened, she was already trying to get him removed from not only her life but their daughters life as well. Fast forward 6 years and I ran back into him (I was 26 and he was 32). We’ve been in a relationship since.   \n\nHe’s NEVER been abusive towards me. We’ve had our fights (don’t get me wrong) but they’ve never turned physical or violent. Now, I’m not dismissing his behavior or hers. I’m just pointing out the fact that I’ve never had an issue with him.   \n\nTo my knowledge, His daughter is 13 now so we have a little while to go until she turns 18. I look up her mother on Facebook now and again just out of curiosity. She married now, went to school, got a degree, the whole 9.   \nHe has made it very clear to me that he wants NOTHING to do with her or her mother and he certainly doesn’t want me in contact with either one of them.   \nWhich, I thought was cold of him. But at the same time, I think I can understand where he’s coming from. His/Her friends/people that knew them (i.e. his sister) tell me that they were abusive to each other, she went behind his back and stopped taking her birth control without telling him, she refused to work and just sat around all day smoking pot, she was a pathological liar (ex. she told multiple people that she couldn’t get pregnant for whatever reason and then one day, BOOM! She’s pregnant.).  \nAnd I understand that they are BOTH at fault here, I want to make that very clear. It takes two to tango. According to him, he wants nothing to do with his daughter simply because that woman is her mother. He thinks that her mother has brainwashed her into believing that everything is his fault and to hate him without question. From what little I saw from her when I was younger, this isn’t far fetched at all.   \nHowever, I have this gut feeling that at some point in the future.. his daughter will come looking for him. How will I handle this situation? What if she wants to keep in contact/have a relationship with me if he pushes her away? Will I be betraying him?   \n\nI’m honestly just looking for advice from people who have found themselves in similar situations.   \n\n***don’t be afraid to be as blunt as possible!***   \n\nThank you!",

This happens at least 2x/3x/week. She's been this way since she's started 2 years ago and our last boss ignored it, and our  new boss (of a year) also ignores it. This teammate is also extremely entitled who needs constant hand holding and I'm so sick of everyone enabling her. I was thinking about saying something to our boss, but he's also incompetent and doesn't seem to have the skills to access it. I kept going over it in my mind, then I was just like, \"what's the point?\". He's not going to do anything and no matter what, she'll continue to be enabled with not doing her job. Morale at our company sucks, and I've been trying to find a new job for the past 6 months, but am not finding anything that's a good fit.\n\nI think what's really bothering me is that I don't really have much of a life outside of work. I (35F) live alone with my dog. I grew up with an abusive family and I've since gone no contact on them. I've also cut off former friends, who were assholes. (Unfortunately I tended to be drawn to narcissistic and manipulative people). \n\nI've recently lost about 20 pounds (I ahem, packed on quite a bit of weight in 2020/2021), gotten my hair highlighted (actually very flattering on me) and gotten into doing my make up. And have cut out all alcohol. I say this because I feel like I spent last year kind of numb and retreating back to my apartment. I've also been going to meet-ups and book club meet-ups, but I'm not really connecting with anyone as friends. I think the more I go to these the better it will be, but it seems like the women really just want to drink and vent, not so much sticking to plans afterwards.\n\nI'm also on Bumble and Hinge, and it's terrible lol. I've put in so much effort with my profile and pictures, but I feel like so many of the guys I see are duds. I haven't seen one guy on them I'm excited about. The last guy I had a crush on was last year. I actually asked him if he wanted to exchange numbers, but he declined. I still want to get married and have kids the next few years. I don't see how I would even meet someone with the way it's going.\n\nI know this is all over the place lol.",

It’s like I’m not worth the time to seek out better flowers and it was just a check off the box.\n\nCan anyone relate? I also don’t want this happening again but I feel bad bringing it up and ruining the day. Advice? Should I just let it go? I honestly want to buy my own pretty flowers today for myself but don’t want him to feel bad.",

        "text": "I know gifts are not a thing for destination weddings, but hear me out. My fiance and I (both 32) both live out of state from our friends and family. We've shown up to every bachelor and bachelorette party (which always required flight, hotel/airbnb, activities, etc), flew out for weddings (some being destination) and given generous cash gifts ($500 per couple). We have spent thousands of dollars on each couple close to us. In my culture, we give generous cash gifts as wedding gifts. That's just what we do. Besides their weddings, we've given generous house warming gifts, baby shower gifts, etc. \n\nOur destination wedding is on a beautiful beach and I chose a slightly nicer resort for better food. (probably costing \\~$200 more per person) and because of this, we both decided to forego bachelor and bachelorette parties and a bridal shower for me. I think bachelorette parties are kind of corny and would rather a spa day with my friends instead. I think bridal showers are boring and it's just another thing for me to plan. I'd rather allocate the funds, time and energy into making my wedding the best experience for my guests and I. We just want everyone to have a good time.\n\nEven with flights, hotel and accommodations, our guests will probably pay less than half of what we spent on their weddings/bachelor/bachelorette parties/other life events.\n\nI think some people seem to be under the impression that our wedding is going to cost us nothing because guests will be paying their way, which is not the case whatsoever. We still have to pay for the ceremony, dj, decor, wait staff, etc. Granted, its less expensive than getting married where we're from, but isn't cheap, by any means. \n\nI don't expect gifts from the people who aren't super close to us. However, I do expect some type of gift from everyone we've shown up for and my sisters think I'm being selfish.\n\nAm I an AH?",

And the biggest aspect of that is sex. I have missed having a romantic partner emotionally for sure, but I have found a lot of self, platonic, and familial fulfillment that have met a lot of those needs and I've enjoyed the ways in which this is changing my perspective on a need for a romantic relationship. There in lies the crux though, I really enjoy sex and while I'm surviving fine with occasionally hooking up, it's because I've remained on the dating apps. I hate them as much as the next person, but they keep me from the freak out of not knowing when I'll have sex next. I recognize this sounds like some inflated anxiety, that isn't lost on me, but isn't it also ok to just really love sex and feel sad and not wanting to give up engaging in it regularly? I want to be off the apps, maybe not for good, but for a good long while (I think it'd be great for my mental health), but I don't have a lot of time in this particular season of life to go out and meet people organically, so I guess I need some reassurance or something. Can't totally put my finger on what I'm asking for. Does anyone relate?",

I’m a responsible person, but I still have a few bad habits like getting up late. Anyways, did anyone here choose to be a single mom either through sperm donation or some form of adoption?",

It made me curious how folks determine when to start considering fertility treatments, etc. - is a full year of diligent trying always necessary first?\n\nI thought it would be interesting to take an informal poll, if only so I can give some assurance to my friend. How old were you when you got pregnant, and how long did it take you? I guess for my friend's sake I'm specifically asking about folks who got pregnant without fertility treatments, IVF, etc., but for my sake I'm curious about whatever yall feel like sharing. And acknowledge many may have no interest in sharing (i feel paranoid that this post may upset someone, so sorry if thats the case, no offense is meant!) And I can go first! I've been pregnant once, when I was nearly 24, and it took a 2-3 months of unprotected sex.\n\n(I also want to make sure and acknowledge this is a space with childfree folks, and folks who have pursued parenthood in a wonderful myriad of ways, with or without partners, etc., and no disrespect is meant by the question focused on a particular way of starting a family! All stories and perspectives are welcome, I only ask specifically about the \"traditional\" form of baby making since that's what my friend is working with for now lol.)",

They don’t ask about my day, I don’t get good morning texts but I get a lot of “u up?” texts (I’m never up) \n\nI’m a whole person and it doesn’t matter - I’m good enough to fuck but not good enough to date and I’m *so* tired of it. \n\nI want to have real conversations and build a genuine, deep connection. Everything is just so sexual and surface-level. \n\nI also don’t give it up that easily unless I *really* like the person and once guys realize that they usually stop talking to me since that’s all they were after.

        "text": "I'm early thirties, my sister is later thirties. Sister is not having kids. Her lifestyle is a big part of it, but she also just doesn't want any. Partner and I are mostly on the no side of the fence. I teach. I love kids. I've never had the urge to have one, and for me that's the number one requirement , a desire for a child. I've never felt guilty about this feeling. I've never felt the need to justify it. I haven't been firmly enough on the no side to try and get sterilized, but I've figured I'll probably never want one. \n\nMy mother mentioned years ago how she can't wait for grandchildren, and at the time I was single so I joked I wanted to be married or at least have a partner first. Partner and I are trying to figure out marriage (mostly the legal aspects of healthcare and income). I was talking with my mom about it on a car ride to an event. Discussed how I don't want to change my last name, but I don't mind taking his socially. How it would be different if we were going to have kids, but we probably aren't. My mom said, but kids are fun! They're fun things!  And I replied that they absolutely are, but Im always tired after work, can't imagine coming home to my own kid, she said I could stay home until they're in school and I went yea. I mentioned how we don't have any money for a kid and she said no one has enough money for a kid, but I am one car repair away from being flat broke (very minimal savings), and if I stopped working to stay home and not be exhausted, we would have almost no income because my partner makes below the poverty line. She then said, I guess [our last name] ends then. And I joked, it's hard a good run. Would have happened eventually. And she said, sincerely I think, that I didn't know how many nights she'd cried herself to sleep over it. \n\nIt was three days ago and I still can't help but feel horrible that I don't want children. I feel like I have deeply hurt her, and it came out of left field because she hasn't mentioned grandchildren in years, not since I mentioned that I needed a partner first. I feel horrible that she's so hurt and maybe I squashed any last hope she had, but that isn't going to make me want a child. That isn't going to make us all of a sudden have relaxing, flexible, very well paying jobs where we have the time and energy for a child. I tried to cheer her up and mentioned we could always adopt or foster, but honestly the older I get, the more I still don't want one. \n\nWe got on with the day and it was fun, and it wasn't mentioned again, but I can't stop thinking about how hurt and sad she is, and I hate that I'm the cause. And honestly, she's probably part of the cause of me not wanting one. It's hard for me to say because I love my mom, but she has always had a short temper and she was abusive . She's gotten better, and I'm an adult so it's better, but the short fuse is still there, just not directed at me. My theory is she went through menopause during my childhood and just....had no patience for kids breaking things on accident, or being kids. We got slapped in the face a lot, never back talked or tried to challenge her, but she had no patience. So maybe I've just internalized for a long time that I never want her around my kids, but I still want a relationship with her, so the solution is just to not have kids. But I feel like I could never tell her this, since she doesn't ever acknowledge the bad things that happened. It's like she's two people to me, the mother I had growing up, and the mother I have now as an adult, and the growing up one gets forgotten on purpose, by everyone. We don't talk about it. She also mentioned that I had a temporal lobe disorder that cause the seizures I had as a kid, but she didn't want them to put me on meds that weren't for kids as young as me, so we just....went to a naturopath and never went back to the doctor until I needed college vaccines. I still don't know if that's a childhood disorder you grow out of or if I need to tell my doc this history and get another EEG done. \n\nI just don't know how to feel or process the things I'm feeling, and of course this happened right after therapy so I've got two weeks before I can discuss it with my therapist. But it's causing me a lot of anguish in the meantime. I don't even want to talk to my sister about it, because I don't want to lay that burden on her, since she's the other half of why my mom won't have grandkids. I just can't compartmentalize this right now and it's really frustrating because of the big conflict of emotions I've got about it.",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI’m in my early thirties and have worked in my field for several years now.\n\nI recently saw a job opening that I’m qualified for and want to take a chance and apply.\n\nThe only thing is that I have a medical surgery scheduled in a couple of months.\n\nThis may take me out of work for a few weeks and would definitely slow me down a bit. \n\nIs it worth applying to this job anyways? If I get an interview, should I let them know prior to the interview? Or should I shoot my shot, interview, and if they decide they want me, then let them know I’ll have to be gone for a few weeks at the start of the job? \n\nThanks for your advice!",

I had it on cold and delicate but I really should have just hand washed it. \n\nIt says do not soak on the label but everything on the internet says I need to soak it with conditioner or wool wash to fix it.\n\nIt was already oversized so I’ve managed to stretch it out to fit, but it’s a little wonky looking and just feels tough to wear.\n\nIs there anything I can do to fix it? It was my mums and she gave it to me and it’s really expensive and I’m hoping I can get it to the softness it used to be.",

        "text": "I feel like I’m the last realistic person I know sometimes. It happens all the time at work and in my personal life where people see me as some kind of Debbie Downer or lazy because I’ll be the first one to be able to see that something isn’t going to work out and I’ll be the one to speak up about it.\n\nI’ve noticed over my lifetime that people just generally seem to prefer when folks push forward with ridiculous plans and act like they’re all going to work out. I’ve tried to do that as I get older, but it does feel false and I have trouble faking it. The older I get, the harder it is to pretend. \n\nAre other people really that bad at recognizing that something isn’t going to work out due to poor planning or obvious circumstances? \n\nExamples:\n\n-The friend who over-schedules herself has plans to meet you for lunch between house hunting with her husband and realtor and going to her cousin’s baby shower, and you know it isn’t going to happen, but she insists she can do all 3. Ultimately she runs late house hunting and has to cancel.\n\n-When you get Covid 4 days before a critical work trip and, even though corporate policy is that you have to test negative on a rapid test to fly, everyone keeps acting like you’ll be able to go on the trip. Of course, you’re still positive on the day you’re supposed to fly.\n\n-Your friends planned a group dinner but the forecast has been calling for 10 inches of snow that night for 3 days. Everyone is suddenly surprised when they have to cancel because the weather is “so much worse” than they thought it would be.\n\nAll of these things? Clearly weren’t going to happen, but in the past 2 months I was made to feel like some kind of sad sack for pointing them out first and trying to get a head start on alternate plans. Is there a trick to this I’m missing? Should I just also act like I can’t clearly see the fallibility in a bad plan so that people think I’m less of a downer?",

        "text": "I find that I can get very upset and angry when I feel like I have been treated badly or wronged, but I know that the other person will never recognise/admit that they may have behaved badly or hurt my feelings. On a logical level I recognise that getting angry about this only causes me further hurt, but on a more primal level I just can't get over the desire to have some sort of validation of the way I am feeling. I can't vent to others, and can't really address it with the person involved either, so I have to deal with the feelings myself. \n\nI would love to find some techniques to just let things go and not give them the headspace they currently take up. Has anyone else struggled with this and found ways to manage it?",
