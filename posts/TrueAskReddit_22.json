The same goes for centre-left leaning tech news (The Verge, WIRED etc) and even far left news sources (ie: VICE).\n\nIf climate change is brought up, all top comments are from deniers. Minimum wage, all top comments are from people who oppose increasing it or advocate lowering it. Anything that pertains to Trudeau becomes an anti-Trudeau circlejerk and anything negative against Trump becomes an anti-\"MSM\" or \"liberal media\" circlejerk. Whatever the far right stance is on any issue, that's the stance that is overwhelmingly reflected in the comments. \n\nI've had conservatives tell me that if I subscribe to conservative sources on Facebook, then the opposite happens wherein liberals dominate the comments. I followed their advice and tried this only to find out it wasn't true. \n\nI'd point the finger at 4Chan or /pol/ but most of the people I'm talking about don't seem to be in this demographic. It's not Russia either, not as far as I can tell (the accounts seem authentic). \n\nThe same thing happens on YouTube as when any seemingly neutral content creator takes a liberal stance on something, the dislikes greatly overwhelm the likes and the comments are all from conservatives. \n\nI'd just like to understand why this happens. Reddit, which is the only social media network I really use, seems to be spared from this phenomenon with some exceptions (/r/canada, /r/worldnews etc). ",

        "text": "Firstly I'm not American and understand that my perspective is severely skewed/limited as its based on second-hand information. Furthermore America is a vast vast country with each state differing to such an extent, that they could almost be separate countries; so I'm not implying that my question applies universally to all Americans (far from it in fact). But, it seems as if the quality of life for many (especially lower and middle class individuals), is lacking behind many other countries. \n\n - Extremely expensive health care.\n\n - Extremely expensive tertiary (university) education relative to other countries.\n\n - Poor employee rights (0 minimum annual leave for example).\n\n -  Lack of opportunities to improve quality of life (**specifically for rural Americans**).\n\n - Current administration is so flawed I don't even know where to begin.\n\n -  Litigious society.\n\n - Undemocratic and unethical aspects to law enforcement such as civil forfeiture, revenue generation (for profit prisons) that specifically targets and disadvantage minorities, etc.\n\n - High rates of gun violence.\n\n - Insufficient safety net, seems like its very easy for people to get knocked down, and be unable to stand back up (fall through the cracks of society), due to systemic issues.\n\n - Hate speech is accepted and tolerated (yes I know free speech is important, but prohibiting hate speech towards other citizens does not remove an individuals ability to protest against the government, therefore its not censorship).\n\n - Based on the legatum prosperity index the US ranks: 22nd in governance, 32nd in health, 52nd in safety &amp; security, **26th in personal freedom**, and 35th in environment.\n\n - Low minimum wage, difficulty in being financially stable and/or prosperous for certain demographics.\n\n - Non-secular aspects of government and education.\n\n - High rates of incarceration (majority black and latinos), harsh sentences for non-violent crimes (war on drugs).\n\nThere are probably other things that I'm forgetting or that I could add to this list, but can't think of right now. To clarify I'm not saying the US is a shit hole, or that I take any issue with the country or its population. Rather, in the last year or two, my perspective has shifted from one of a prosperous, beautiful country with an amazing quality of life, to something that seems rather lacking given how wealthy and developed the country is. I know the US is too large and complex to emulate Scandinavian countries for example, but it seems like much progress could be made, that just isnt for some reason. Is my perspective skewed by media and news sources, what is the quality of life for the vast majority of the population like compared to other developed nations?",

        "text": "I really do believe that the system has evolved into a fully corrupt one. Everyone seems compromised to some extent. Given that fact, what sort of political behavior makes the most sense?\n\nI've been voting for 3 presidential election cycles and I've always been practical, mostly voting (D) and here and there some independents in local elections where they have a real chance/my vote carries more weight. \n\nBut recently I've been shamed by some progressives for so easily giving Dems a pass (and vote) for their unacceptable behavior. And often, I'm left feeling like I lack conviction. As soon as I use any variation of the \"lesser evil\" argument, I'm hit with, \"if you use the republicans as a reference point, you don't have nearly high enough standards.\"\n\nBut I so quickly rationalize it as \"making compromises is an essential part of being part of a society. The Dems are demonstrably governing toward my interest, even if simultaneously participating in a corrupt system that ultimately serves the rich\" \n\nBut then, I'm stuck with, \"when I vote (D) I'm not making a compromise with society, I'm making a compromise with the system of governance and its rules. That system is supposed to serve me.\"\n\nit goes on and on and it's one of the few internal conflicts I have where I'm not okay just shrugging my shoulders and living with \"it is what it is.\" I really want resolution to this particular problem - I want to behave optimally and do my part to improve governance at all levels and for all people.  \n \nWhat are your thoughts?",

If that person then gets diagnosed with ADHD, the person will no longer be considered dumb, \"he's just as smart as the others, he simply has concentration problems\". Why does the diagnosis change the perception of his intelligence? \n\n2) Somebody sucks at math and he's called dumb. He's then diagnosed with dyscalculia. Suddenly they don't consider him dumb anymore.  \n\nSo I guess you can also phrase it as: why do people not see things such as concentration problems, or any disorder really, as an inherent part of us?
