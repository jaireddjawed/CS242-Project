I am taking Geometry next semester and I am determined to take Calculus by the time I graduate high-school. My plan so far is to get an undergraduate in physics and then narrow it down to astrophysics or astronomy. Of course, this is subject to change. \n\nAre there any books or resources I can read that would be able to help better my understanding of physics? What can I do to help prepare myself and better my chances of being accepted into a good university? Multiple people have already told me to learn to Python and C++/C/Fortran as well as keeping up with my math skills, is there anything else you guys can suggest? Thank you so much!\n",

Quick question about the implications of duel citizenship on future jobs.\n\nI'm going back to school for a BSc in either Chemical Physics or Astronomy and Physics and super interested in going into Astrophysics, despite the lack of jobs. I plan on upping my coding skills while in school as well as a backup. I have Canadian citizenship and recently found out I qualify for Portuguese citizenship, which I can use to apply for internships across the EU. However, I'm unsure if duel citizenship will bar me from Canadian jobs. \n\nI have already passed level I security clearance, and a quick glance over the forms doesn't seem to bar me from higher level clearance if I hold duel citizenship. I'm not sure about the reverse however, or if the EU will bar people from overseas on principal. I'm curious if anyone has any advice on the implications of duel citizenship for astrophysics jobs and wither it's worth investing the money. Total costs are going to be roughly 800$ which is close enough to the price of a credit I'm debating risking it just to apply for ESA internships. ",

It's giving me a headache just listening to him, but I have no clue about astrophysics as I am a computer engineering major myself.\n\nBasically what this guy is claiming is that stars are formed by planets which are earth size. WHAT!?\n\nHe claims\n\n    The key to understanding how life appeared in the universe is to understand how \n    early the planets appeared and how very, very, many there are. Rather than 8 \n    planets per star there are about 30,000,000. All these formed hot 300,000 years \n    after the big bang, not 300,000,000 years. Only a few came from stars. Planets \n    come from proto-galaxies, which fragmented entirely into planets at the plasma to \n    gas transition.\n\n[Source](http://journalofcosmology.com/JOC22/GibsonSPIE2013Aug4.pdf) on Page 6.     \n\nHe claims that life did not originate on earth, but instead meteors brought life to earth, which is a bit easier to believe.\n\nHe owns the Journal of Cosmology and only publishes in there. According to him he is pretty much banned from publishing in all the popular journals that have to do with astrophysics.\n\nwww.JournalOfCosmology.com\n\nHe is also being ridiculed [here](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/03/08/i-am-getting-a-very-poor-impre/) by a biologist. \n\nThe guy's name is Carl H. Gibson\n\nI guess what I am asking whether there is any truth to what he is saying?\n\n\nEdit: I should clarify, he is a really nice guy, and he has been a professor for a very long time but he is dead set on his theory ad very close minded.

        "text": "Hello community, I am in a college course about the Solar System and this past week we have been studying tides (those of the Earth-Moon system in particular). I know that the tidal effects taking place on Earth are due to the Sun and Moon (at least these are the only tidal effects significant enough for me to take into consideration in this case), but what I am asked to discuss are hypothetical tides taking place on Jupiter compared to those here on Earth. I know that this question is meant to pick at my (and my fellow classmates') brain(s) but hopefully someone will have some input regarding my thinking.\n\nWhat I suspect to be characteristic of the tides on Jupiter is that first and foremost they should be less drastic on a planetary scale (how much the \"surface\" is distorted) than here on Earth simply due to how massive it is. What I am also taking into consideration is that Jupiter has more than 60 known satellites in orbit around it, each inducing their own individual tidal effects on the gas giant thus resulting in a less symmetrical distortion in Jupiter's shape (as insignificant as said distortion my be). The last thing I am taking into consideration in my comparison is that the mean density of Earth is over four times greater than the mean density of Jupiter hence the gaseous composition of Jupiter means that it will be more malleable under tidal effects than Earth is.... Never have I posted anything this extensive but thank you for reading and/or providing some direction.",

The data I've used for the planetary positions has two components, the keplerian element and it's rate.

According to the equation of time dilation for a clock with relative velocity, the time dilation asymptotically approaches infinity as v approaches c, which seems right, but this does not seem to agree with the equation for gravitational time dilation.\nDoes this mean that the laws of physics do not hold true beyond the event horizon?\n\nI'm not trying to disprove or doubt anything, I'm just curious and want to make sense of this.

Physics professor is an awesome guy that is very intelligent and for the most part knows his shit. Problem is, firstly, he claims that the Oort cloud is a fairy tale, though I argued even though we can't see it, our models predict it should be there because of comet trajectories, ect. Secondly, he also claims that through all the dating methods we have acquired, they can be very inaccurate and unreliable, and the 4.54 billion year old earth is probably very off, and that the only reason we believe this is because of assumptions and having it repeated to us over and over again.\n\nFrankly, I disagree and am very skeptical, though he apparently has a much more in depth argument he has not shared with us yet because we did not have time for today. I told him that if he can sway the scientific consensus on these matters with actual evidence it would bring him fame. Not sure he liked that:)\n\nCouldn't find any reliable scientific evidence for his claims on the internet yet, but I'm curious to what you guys have to say, and some empirical evidence I could digest. as I don't want to stand idly by and have him teach fallacies to a class if his claims hold no water.",

        "text": "So I've just started taking a more active approach to Astrophysics and wondered if there were people on here who could discuss things and clarify certain theories I've been reading about, I'm not science illiterate but I'll confess I'm no Stephen Hawkins either.\n\nHaving recently read some of the works of NDT it lead me to read and watch some stuff relating to dimensions and the theories related to them. \n\nThe first question I have regards the so called \"10th Dimension\", the ultimate of our dimensional awareness, as i understand it the 10th Dimension is the embodiment of every possible dimension including the crossing over of infinite dimensions with other infinite dimensions. Therefore you can't have more than 10 dimensions because theoretically 10thDimA would already include 10thDimB (that's how I've understood it, could be entirely wrong). But i was wondering, could the 10th Dimension infact be light? I imagine many learned astrophysicist just did a huge collective facepalm for which i apologise.\n\nObviously light travels through photons and if light is ever-present therefore surely photons must be too. Everything from a 1 dimensional point to a 3 dimensional object requires the presence of photons and light for it to be seen. And since time (4th Dimension) is also affected by light, does that mean that everything 5th Dimension upwards (3d objects existing in 4d \"areas of spacetime\" with alternative 5^D possible paths) also would use light + photons as their \"constant of existance\", the ever-present constant in every dimension (\"the tenth dimension\")?\n\nFurthermore at the event horizon of black holes, while many have theorized that because everything reaches the speed of light due to gravitational extremities we cannot perceive there to be anything existing. What if the density is so great that upon the destruction of the photons (loss of electromagnetic charge, destruction of protons etc) light can no longer travel and therefore if it was the \"10th dimensional fabric\" that all things exist upon, and it itself ceased to exist, that would explain the absence of anything past the event horizon? \n\nI imagine to most people I sound like an idiot spouting newly learnt words out of my face like a water fountain, they would of course be entirely correct but we all have to start somewhere!",

Relativity says that traveling at the speed of light means that the passage of time stops (relative to everything else).\n\nIf you look at a black hole in our universe, there's a point at which light can no longer escape. That would basically mean that gravity is pulling so strong that it is accelerating matter/energy at the speed of light towards the singularity at the center. That event horizon becomes the mathematical spherical surface wherein time can no longer move.\n\nTo a certain extent, if time isn't moving, you can pretty much throw it away as a dimension of time/space. An event horizon becomes a way to smash a 4 dimensional universe into a 3 dimensional one.\n\nMove that same black hole into a 5 dimensional universe, with the dimensions of length, width, height, time, and for lack of a better name, spaghetti. Time is just another axis of motion in the 5 dimensional universe is the same as length, width, or height is for us. Spaghetti is the 5 dimensional equivalent of time, and spaghetti is the dimension that gets flattened, smeared out over the surface of event horizon of that 5 dimensional black hole.\n\nOur universe's expansion can also be explained by this theory; the 5 dimensional black hole continues to consume 5 dimensional matter and, as such, the event horizon is expanding.\n\nIs this pretty much how it works?",

Life took a different path and I didn't even end up in the hard sciences. Now as I am struggling to put a life back together the only thing that gives me any joy and drive is space, the universe, discovery, understanding...Astrophysics, astronomy, engineering related to aerospace and the like...all options I am considering but I am attracted mostly to \"out there\" and love data and searching for answers. I watch the ISS go over regularly, look up as much as the cloud cover and my old eyes will allow, and still smile like a dopey kid every time. Nothing else does that for me anymore. Then I go inside and start imagining distances and speeds and get lost in the wonder of a kid who first learned about the planets. \n\nAgain I am 40, have some difficult medical issues that prevent me from doing the \"study full time and work 4 jobs on the side to pay for it route (too much pain and not enough energy to do that like when I was 21), and pretty broke. I have a small pension from my previous career...like doesn't even cover rent in most areas small...and am unemployed as a result. No kids or wife anything to root me somewhere and at this point don't see either happening. All I own are some clothes and a laptop. My biggest limits are endurance due to health and money.\n\nI would be starting entirely from scratch in about every regard, because despite the fact I was a good STEM sort of student and got top marks in high school and intro type university courses, I struggle now trying to understand most wikipedia articles on the subjects. It's been too long...I was good at memorizing for exams but don't feel I rooted a lot of knowledge in my brain...and just can't pick up where I left off. I also don't have a bachelor's degree as I went into a technical field where it wasn't needed and now I regret it. I am not stupid...I believe I have the capacity...I just don't know if it's realistic with regards to opportunities for education and for work.\n\nI appreciate any and all input :)\n\nIf there is a place I should cross post this...or you think is a better fit I am all ears. \n\n**TL:DR- Want to hear an alien communications signal with my headphones while relaxing on the hood of an old car, and then travel through a wormhole to meet said aliens.**\n\n**ACTUAL TL:DR- Old, broken, broke...want to be a scientist and a skyward gazing dreamer in the productive time I have left...is it REALISTICALLY possible especially with my limitations?**",
