I don’t want to be this person anymore. \n\nI think a lot of this behavior comes from my diagnosed depression and very old trauma that I never got help for so I’ve gotten myself on some antidepressants and started listening to self-help podcasts. These things have helped quite a bit but I feel like there’s still lots of room for improvement. \n\nI’m saving up money to eventually get into therapy but is there anything else I can do in the mean time to break these habits?

I guess I wasn't good enough. I have severe porn  addiction, social anxiety etc and I have absolutely nothing going for me  at the age 24. The only things that I enjoy in life are superhero  stuff, you know like Marvel and DC content. I guess they give me some  kind of faith even though I know it's just fiction. The truth is I don't  think I'm built for the current world. I know people say that \"no one  has their sh1t together all the time\", but I'm so far behind everyone,  it's not even funny. I don't know how to do basic tasks as I've lived  relatively sheltered life. Can't even show up to a job interview, how  f#cked am I. But I want to change that and rebuild myself. No like  seriously rebuild myself! Physically, mentally, financially etc. And I  think it's better if I removed all the distractions so I can fully  commit myself to this self improvement journey. Besides, all the so  called \"friends\" don't really understand or care about me anyway.  They're all hypocrites. The question is, where do I start? Physical part  I kind of figured out, I plan on getting a gym membership next month,  but what about everything else? Any advice is appreciated. Also I don't  wanna hear the \"isolating yourself is bad\" stuff. Life has proven that I  do more harm when I'm around people.",

There was a glitch, and it was seemingly an obscure issue that didn't have much helpful info for a layperson like me online. Long story short, I proceeded to spend the better part of *4 hours* trying to solve the issue by searching online and chatting with support agents from the company that owned the software, my ISP, and my device manufacturer. As a result, I neglected all the tasks I had planned to get done during that time block, went to bed late (and woke up late today), and felt extremely upset with myself and the situation. \n\nThis morning, I tried one more solution, which failed. I then decided to try the software on a family member's device. Lo and behold, it worked, right away. You can imagine how I felt at that moment.\n\nSurely I had thought to try this last night? I can't remember for sure, but if I did, for whatever reason I decided to keep on with my brute force method instead of trying the simplest solution.\n\nI wonder, was I subconsciously trying to make this harder for myself so that I could avoid my responsibilities in lieu of something I supposedly *had* to do? I definitely wasn't doing anything productive during all the in-between time of waiting for support to reply because I didn't want to have to start and stop a task.\n\nI don't do stuff like this *all* the time, but it does happen more frequently than I would like (albeit *usually* not as bad as this example). I can't help wondering if this is some sort of self-sabotage, because sometimes I think deep down I know that there is a simpler solution (or even that the problem is already solved).",

        "text": "Why should you improve yourself? What's wrong with your life the way it is? Well, here is one reason why you should improve yourself, a reason we all care about.\n\nDo you know what you take with you when you die? Is it your money? Is it your wealth? Is it the trophies that you might or might not have dedicated your life to? No, none of that matters. There is only one thing that you take with yourself to your grave, and that is your memories.\n\nNow imagine yourself in the grave, you are dying, but instead of fear, you feel contentment. Your face is content and ready to face death. You know why, because right then, your life will be flashing before your eyes. And all of your most beautiful memories will be reloved in that very moment. Your first day in school, your first time trying out a new restaurant, your first time graduating a class. You will remember all your achievements. Yes, in reality your achievements don't matter in the grand scheme of things, but that was never the point. Right then, as you die, you recall the moments of pride for every achievement, every test your aced, and that football game you won! You then remember your first girlfriend, and all the amazing memories. You remember your first time having sex. Then you remember your second girlfriend. You recall how sex was even better with her, you loved her so much! You both go on all sorts of amazing vacations together with your friends. Your recall the times you aced in college and the times you messed around. You recall the exact moment you wanted to marry your wife, and the exact moment you asked her. You recall the marriage, and then your children. Their smiles, and how they grew. You recall all the small things your wife did for you and that you did for your wife, including the back rubs, or the kisses or washing the dishes together. You recall the times your were competent at the career your liked, the times when you felt accomplished. You recall all your brithdays, and how your children and wife always made up elaborate plans to surprise you! You also remember all the plans you made to surprise your wife. \n\nYou recall all the adventures, that moment when you hit your pr in the gym. And then you recall the calm chats you had with your wife when you were old.\n\nAs you remember all these memories, you confidently say \"i lived a good life.\"\n\nYou all reading this right now, want to feel like this when you die right? Well, guess what. It's not free. These memories arent free. Life is about collecting memories, and you won't get any of them if you don't become someone. You won't make friends and family, you won't achieve anything, you won't go on any adventures and you won't have any memories of the numerous small moments of affection, if you sir on your ass all day in your room while only scrolling in reddit while scratching your fat, lonely, belly. You won't have memories of pride if you dotn achieve what you want to, you won't have memories of making friends and family if you don't go out there and build your social skills and manage your weight. You won't be healthy if you constantly indulge incakes and chocolates. You won't ever have that loving amazing family if you don't become a loving and amazing father and husband. You won't have any achievements if you don't try to excel. You won't have any travels or adventures if you continue to be lazy. If things on like this, you will lie on your death bed scrolling through nothing but a blur of memories of you only watching memes or tiktoks. You will beg for your life, there was so much left to experience. But it was too late, we all have limited time. \n\nSo, improve yourself. Develop a good physique for better health, self esteem, and love life. Become a better and more romantic and more understanding husband, a better father, a better and more fun friend, a better professional, have better finances. Get rid of your bad destructive habits, as those will be the source of countless negative memories. As you get better, you will naturally go through better experiences. Your life is a reflection of yourself. Want to improve your life? Improve yourself.\n\nSo each day, whenever you grind, always do so filled with excitement, filled with all the wonderful gifts that the future has waiting for you. Life won't always be fair, but by doing so you will increase your chances of goodness and prosperity!",

        "text": "(27m) I've been focusing on making my life exciting as an end goal. Kind of like a game like a Need For Speed or sleeping dogs mentality (of course without the crimes etc) just a life being eventful, a good amount of people that are full of life and ambitions to interact and do things with, a mostly interesting job or career, maybe a motorcycle, etc.\n\nBut I notice that all those things have gotten harder to obtain. More than I've last seen them. Realized a motorcycle or car is more to maintain, I used to run a car club but after it went down, the ambitious and full of life people can't be replaced and they ended up being the opposite, and that \"eventful life\" is gone. People dont seem to even want to try to leave the house anymore so I end up gaming or watching a movie that puts me even more into deep sadness. Just work and hanging around in a new house I just moved into. \n\nI've pushed to move up in my job for something more interesting and more pay, but the process is slow no matter how hard I push, I'm exercising a little but also feel I don't have a end goal that I can keep striving for (like how vegeta and goku keep training to keep passing their limits and actually use their skills), learning to fight might help but where will I use it other than in the ring?\n\nMaybe im just chasing after the feeling i had when i had the club and im stuck. Am I over thinking things, am right about my realization, or are there things I can look into to further my search for that feeling again?",

People never approach me and I’m often ignored by my peers. But this is expected as i’m a POC. I can’t even walk properly in front of any person (I get too self conscious and start to walk a bit funny) and avoid making eye contact, even people that I’ve known for years. Now that I’m in college, I’m worried about where this would lead me. There are so many career opportunities that I’m afraid i will miss out on due to my social anxiety. As English is my second language, I don’t have an accent and I’m worried that I will fail job interviews and stuff. I want to learn to love myself and stop caring about what others think of me. I want to be more confident in the way I walk and think. But I just don’t know where to start. Thinking about it makes me anxious and I’m starting to feel as if I’ll fall into depression very soon.

        "text": "Hello there :)\nThe following lessons are what I've gathered so far in my 19 years of my life. These are from my notes app and directed at myself really. This isn't professional advice, so take it with a grain of salt. BUT, i decided to post them here just in case something in here ends up being of use to anyone. \nHere goes nothing... \n\n* Most of the time when i haven't succeeded at smthing is either because i was too confident/over-optimistic about the results being in my favour and didn't really work for it, or because i had way less faith in myself so i didn't bother to put in the work. The common thing between the two was always not taking enough action. Thus, the right amount of confidence, realism and optimism and most of all, work put in is the recipe for achieving goals. \n\n* Worrying too much about potential happenings is either worrying about something that'll never happen, or worrying twice about the same thing. \n\n* You have no actual control over other people/their opinions. Wanting to change either is a waste of energy at best and controlling at worst. \n\n* You're probably having a rematch of the argument you had 1 year ago in your head as an attempt to feel in control of the situation in some sense. But guess what, it's already past and you can't do anything about it. It's bad especially when you catch yourself doing it obsessively. Learn to let things go, especially when that's what you need to do to keep your peace of mind. \n\n* Taking things personally that are not even directed at you as an individual is just... Not very smart. Also, taking things personally period is something i could do without overall. \n\n* Take the smallest step if you don't feel like doing something. I mostly procrastinate because i am not in the mood to commit to a daunting task. So i don't. Instead of telling myself to do the work, i just do the bare minimum by doing the first step associated with the task. This breaks the inertia of non-action which i find the hardest to do. For example: You have a bunch of emails to reply to? And you're scrolling on instagram but the back of your mind is screaming at you to do it but it's just too daunting? It's okay. Tell yourself you don't have to do that. All you have to do is, JUST get your laptop and open the email app. That's all....and believe me chances are you'll be good from there. \nThis works so well for me personally. Whenever I'm not up for my daily morning walk, i just tell myself it's okay i need not walk for an hour straight, just put on my shoes. That's it. And I'm usually off from there. \n\n* Consuming too much information, especially about emotionally impactful topics, is like making yourself sick from overeating... But for the brain rather than your tummy. I feel icky and stagnant in my mind whenever I go down certain rabbit holes. Take a break. Touch the metaphorical grass.",

The point is when I feel uncomfortable , or I don't like someone, don't want to talk to someone, I do either of two things: shut down completely and stop talking or over-share and talk too much. I  didn't want to make her feel bad bc  even If I don't like her , she's my friends partner so I'll respect that. But that made me choose option B, which was word vomit I ended up coming off stupid, immature,  just not me.

It was in good intentions but with poor results.\n\nThis was by far the worst interaction I've ever had for a first impression and half of it was my fault.

        "text": "Being a pushover is a turn-off to most people.\n\nIf you want to stop being a pushover, there's a skill you need to learn.\n\n**Setting solid boundaries.**\n\nWeak boundaries with other people is one of the biggest reasons for a lack of self-esteem, social anxiety and poor relationships.\n\nBut what is a boundary?\n\n*“A personal boundary refers to a psychological or emotional limit that a person sets for themselves in terms of how they allow others to treat or interact with them.”*\n\nBoundaries are the rules you establish to not let anyone f#ck with you.\n\nThey’re essential to living a great life where you’re free to be yourself.\n\nBut why do so many men struggle with boundaries? A few reasons…\n\n* **Guilt.** Feeling selfish for setting boundaries or sticking up for yourself.\n* **Fear of rejection or abandonment**. Thinking that people will leave you.\n* **Fear of conflict**. Thinking that things will get out of hand and you can’t handle it.\n\nThere’s many more.\n\nIf you have weak boundaries, for whatever reason, **this needs to stop.**\n\nA lack of strong boundaries costs you self-respect, creates inauthentic relationships and robs you of your personal power. By letting people walk all over you you’re telling yourself you don’t deserve better. It makes you low-status and lower value.\n\n**So here’s the game plan to implement boundaries on your own...**\n\n1. **Identify your values and priorities**. What’s important to you here? For example, if it’s important for you to be respected at work by your colleagues then you know what your goal is. Another example might be with your woman you might value alone time to feel free in the relationship. Get clear on what’s important to you and what your goals are.\n2. **Know your patterns**. What do you normally do? Let people walk all over you how? Do you pretend you didn’t hear them? Smile and laugh even if you’re offended? Say “it’s no problem” even when it definitely was a problem? When you know your patterns you can catch them before it’s too late.\n3. **Define your boundaries**. Once you understand your values and priorities, it's time to identify your limits and needs. Think about what you're comfortable with and what makes you feel uncomfortable or stressed. Write it down.\n4. **Communicate clearly and assertively**. Use \"I\" statements to express your needs and preferences, and avoid blaming or criticizing others. Be firm and confident, but also respectful and empathetic.\n5. **Stand your ground**. You will be tested on this. Expect it. Sit with the intense emotions of guilt and shame. Resist the urge to go back on your boundary, over-accommodate or apologize just for communicating it. Remember, you don’t need to fix their feelings if they have them. It isn’t up to you to make everything nice. You can leave the interaction at any time. You always have that freedom.\n\nA lack of boundaries invites a lack of respect.\n\nBoth from other people but most important a lack of respect for yourself.\n\nTake care\n\nOliver",

        "text": "TL:DR: I try new thing, get obsessed with it. Become very good at it. Lose interest in said thing and stop doing it.\n\nI am a person who does whatever they set their mind to and achieves what I want through hard work and determination. This helps me in getting better in almost everything and improving exponentially in that specific field. For example, if I wanna learn a programming language, I pick it up and make like 3-4 projects on it within a week. Recently I got into chess and good very good at it and also better than the people who introduced me to chess in the first place.\n\nBut there's a problem with that:\n\nYou see, all this sounds great, but the problem is that the secret to me improving so quick is I get SUPER OBSESSIVE over these things. When I played chess, I used to average like 7-8 hrs per day. When I programmed in a new language, I used to program until my back ached and even stayed up a couple of days, obsessively improving my projects even though there was no deadline or anything on me regarding those projects.\n\nAnd then I just suddenly stop. I stop working on the language when I think I'm good enough and for example stop playing much chess when I think I'm good enough. As soon as I pass the threshold of skill I've made for myself, I start losing interest and reduce how much I work on that particular thing.\n\nSo my question is, is this bad for me? I feel like I waste my time because of this but I also dont want to lose this 'skill' as it helps me improve very quickly. Is there any way I might improve this obsession and make it more consistent?",

        "text": "I grew up really socially inept and I've improved alot over the years but one thing I can't seem to shake off is my arrogance. Let me give you an example.\n\nI had an oral exam recently and things were going smoothly until I didn't know the answer to a question. They asked me \"what are the differences between x and y?\" and I said \"The difference are... um, I'm gonna be honest with you guys I don't know what the difference are.. I'm really being honest with you here... maybe you can tell me what the differences are\" and after that their faces turned and one of them asked \"do you know you are doing an exam right now?\" and I didn't say it but I was thinking \"ofc I fucking know I'm doing an exam rn\" and after that the whole thing turned sour. They asked like another question or two but the vibe was already so off I felt it didn't matter what I answered. After those I asked \"are we done?\" and they stared me with this weird look in their eyes and said \"yeah we can't let you pass,  you can leave now\". I just got up said \"goodbye\" with my back turned to them and left the room thinking \"those dead inside fish-eyed examiners, man\" \n\nI told the story to my family and they said I was the one being kinda rude there. Only then I realised that I probably was. I came out of that classroom thinking they did me wrong for saying some fair and innocent shit.\n\nThese things aren't easy to admit. Honestly in my mind I want to have the most empathetic, spiritually connective conversations with every person I meet but things can get pretty confrotational pretty quick for me because the first thing that comes to my head is often some arrogant bullshit. Evethough I do try to think what I'm about to say, the worst thing is I don't recognize it before or even after I say it unless someone explains why I was being rude. When I'm alone I just think \"What the fuck is wrong with people? I hate people so much.\" and ultimately it makes me feel incredibly lonely. Doesn't happen like always but happens pretty often.\n\nHas anyone struggled with a similar problem? I often get a sense that people don't like me. Never had many friends although I've met many people in my life. I really don't mean to be an asshole. It just comes out of me. Maybe because I was bullied a bit in school and I was always in a fighting mindset. I have been diagnosed with SAD and depression in the past but I'm pretty good nowadays.",

Dont be too hard on yourself finding the right people and dont be too hard on yourself expecting from the wrong people. Once you realise this it's very easy to let go of people. Its human nature to expect from people who we care about and give it all but unfortunately they dont give back as much as we give them and honestly i dont think it's unfair to expect from people who we have a established relationship with. Communicate with them if necessary and if you still feel like they dont meet your expectations, move on. Dont put your energy out much on to them.",

But even though scrolling through instagram makes me miserable because it triggers my insecurities, I could never delete it because I occasionally want to post the fun parts of my life.\n\nBut it's not just social media. It's real life, too. When a coworker asks me what I did on the weekend, I would feel bad for having a quiet weekend in even when I enjoyed it. \n\nI often compare my life in terms of partying, vacations, friends, and money to other people I know from uni or work to make sure I am doing well.\n\nWhen I feel I am behind on something, like not going out enough, not doing fun things enough, not having enough friends, I would do everything to make it better.\n\nInflicting this kind of pressure on me is especially stupid as I don't like many of the things I want other people to think I have. Like going out - I am done with it and only do it because I want others to think I am fun. Or having a tonne of friends and big hangouts all the time - I do much better with only a few people. But in my social environment, everything is about quantity, not quality. I know one guy who celebrated his 30th birthday with 50 friends that all flew to another continent for him. The fact that I would not be able to pull that off makes me feel worthless, despite me not wanting to celebrate my birthday that way.\n\nRecently, I turned down a job that I was genuinely thrilled about and despite not being happy in my current job. Because it pays half of what I get know and is way less prestigious. I was so scared of how this would affect my social life that I couldn't do it.\n\nI did a lot of therapy. I know that my behavior has something to do with me not fully accepting who I am. After years of denying my own needs for the sake of outward appearance, I don't even fully know what I want and who I am in life.\n\nBut even though all this comparison is making me miserable, I can't or don't want to quit it. Because I am so scared that the moment I finally start following all my wants and needs, I will lead a boring life. Lose all my friends because I am not fun anymore. And not be part of my social circle anymore.\n\nI needed to put my thoughts out there. But of course, I am fully aware that all of this is on me.",

Struggled with addiction to P for awhile during summer, eating unhealthy junk food (still kind of do), finished high school but never shown up to my graduation ceremony after everything just happened I was in a deep dark rabbit hole alone with negative thoughts. Gotten into self improvement just seeing Hamza as inspiration for me to live life better. I was obsessed with it which led me get into the gym, then soon after I later met my girlfriend through a reddit thread she made and eventually we started dating. I was happy, she made me felt happy inside which gave me motivation for me to do self help work for awhile I was on right path until her dad discovered our online relationship she forced to cut off the relationship I become devastated by that. I left the gym and stopped working out because of that I left empty. Sometime later, I reconnected with her again but things we’re different she was terrified of relationships which I don’t understand why she felt that way today then she told me trauma and abuse by people in her life and her dad…. is a disgusting person his actions are unbelievable on one doing of their own child I hated him so much for everything. Now I never met, if I do I’ll sock him so hard. The aftermath it was obvious me and her weren’t going to make work, I left, so heartbroken by that. Ever since then today I’m still affected by it but moved on and didn’t care anymore. Now I work at a job earning good money to financially be self sufficient I’m a bit happy but my painful memories still haunt me at work isn’t so good for my work ethic there I became slow by that during work I kept pushing through hour by hour until my shift was done. Now 2023, I want to try getting big goals I have on my mind to make progress on it. Not only my job is making me happy, but I want more out of life hopefully I can get back into gym to get my body in the best shape ever I’ll be trying to focus on myself and not relationships done with that.

        "text": "I started when I was young, and I can confidently say that practicing karate drastically improved my character, discipline, and overall mental and physical health. I would not be half the man I am now if I didn’t start practicing karate when I was younger. Not only do they do wonders for your mind, martial arts will also help a ton with fitness and flexibility. Literally everyone on this sub will tell you that physical improvement and doing something hard will make you feel great. A martial art is probably one of the best choices for this by far. Karate also improved my self confidence by miles because I knew I had the skills to keep myself safe, which is another awesome benefit. Do a little research, you can probably find a few schools in your area. I do Kempo discipline Karate, and I have to recommend it because I know they tech principles as well as skills, but most martial arts do.",

        "text": "***DISCLAIMER:*** I do not claim any of this. I compiled these ideas from many books and articles.\n\n***Your feedback is appreciated. What would you add or takeaway? I kindly ask that you contribute, so that we can help each other and others!***\n\nThese changes will not happen over night. Start where you are, build one habit at a time. Do not overwhelm yourself. You and I are both human. Begin where you are, as humbling and humiliating as that is.\n\n# You are not beyond saving.\n\nI hope this helps you, as it helps me. Let’s begin.\n\n**INTRO:**\n\n1% Better Each Day. Get used to doing hard work, even when you don’t feel like it. The devil uses down time for temptations. One challenging/uncomfortable thing a day. Do one harder option every day. Develop your “taking action skill.” Reduce instant gratification and increase delayed gratification. Structure your day around your values. What is the best thing to do for right now?\n\nStop reading self-help books and material. If you do, only read the summaries online. However, I have made this list for you and I, so that we don’t have to.\n\n**HABITS:**\n\n“You cannot succeed without the three “foundations” of health: fitness, diet, and sleep.”\n\nTo make good habits easier, reduce the number of steps to do them. To make bad habits harder, increase the number of steps between you and the habit. Choose a substitute for your bad habit. - - Lessen the amount of superstimuli in your life to get more dopamine (motivation).\n\n\\- Design your environment for success. (If you want to run, lay your clothes and shoes out. If you want to floss, have it out on the counter for you to see)\n\nOne Year Rule: Will I regret not starting this habit a year from now? Doing this thing? Not doing this thing? Starting a habit, stopping a habit? Look forward to where you might be in one year if you did this thing.\n\n1. Start with a habit that is so easy you can’t say no. (Pick a keystone habit, for better results).\n2. Take some time to understand exactly what is holding you back.\n3. Develop a plan for when you fail. Commit to consistency, not intensity. Make it laughably easy. Do no less but also NO MORE than you agreed to do for 30 days. Do it every day for 30 days straight. Set schedules rather than deadlines. Forget about performance and focus on building a new identity. Make this your new motto: “Never miss twice.” The Goal is Not the Point: Choose your goals and then forget them. Trust that your direction is true and pour your energy into walking the path. Good goals provide direction to your life. They allow you to commit to a journey. They are like a rudder on a boat, directing your energy and attention in a specific direction as you move downstream. We all have a map to explore. Choose a path and then walk it. Focus on the behavior, not the outcome. Measure backward and then get a little bit better. What did you do last week? How can you improve by just a little bit this week?\n\n“During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on \\[DAY\\] at \\[TIME\\] in \\[PLACE\\].”\n\n“I will \\[BEHAVIOR\\] at \\[TIME\\] in \\[LOCATION\\].”\n\nIf, then… The “if–then” strategy gives you a clear plan for overcoming the unexpected stuff, which means it’s less likely that you’ll be swept away by the urgencies of life.\n\n“If \\_\\_\\_ happens, then I will \\_\\_\\_.”\n\nUse momentum, not motivation.\n\n**EXERCISE:**\n\n\"Treat it like a spa. Go there but don't make yourself work out unless you feel like it. If you don't want to work out, just sit there for 30 minutes. But go every day.\"\n\n* Weight train 45 min - 1 hour (every OTHER day + flexible based on travel) basic, boring, simple workouts VS Cardio on OFF days (jogging, skip rope, swim, run, weight vest run, backwards hill walk, hill walk bands in sunlight) - phone always off or out for MOST workouts.\n* Stronglifts 5x5 (great, FREE program that you can view online)\n* Show up to the gym 4x a week for 3 months and do exercises. 4 easy workouts a week for 3 months, then consider upping the intensity.\n* **Consistency,** not intensity.\n* Push/Pull/Legs split, keep it simple.\n* Kettlebells work.\n* Team sports are great.\n* Health block, in a daily timetable… What symptoms am I experiencing? Research and do something about it.\n* Cardio 2-3x a week, 20,000 steps (Research types at cardio you enjoy.)\n* Breathing mechanics are important. 90/90 breathing is a great exercise to use.\n\n**DIET:**\n\n* Eat base ingredients: Artichokes, green peas, broccoli, Chickpeas, Lentils, Beans (kidney, pinto, and white), Whole grains, apples, blueberries, almonds, and pistachios, vegetables, meats, nuts, eggs\n* Other: Quark, walnuts, cottage cheese, fish oil, protein drink, fruit, grains, smoothies etc.\n* Late-day foods that bring on sleep: bananas, oatmeal, and potatoes\n\nTreat yourself on weekends. Don’t treat yourself like a slave. Reward yourself.\n\nRemember to drink water! Start small (as with everything) get consistent, and then up how much you drink. (Roughly 15 cups for men, 11 cups for women, per day).\n\n**HYGEINE:**\n\n* Brush/floss 2x a day.\n* Shower once a day/as needed.\n* Have a skin care routine (Exfoliate 3 times a week and moisturize every morning and night after washing your face with hot then cold water).\n\n**MENTAL HEALTH:**\n\nDeep Breathing: Three times a day you take 10 “power breaths” using a ratio of 1-4-2. For instance, if you inhale for 6 seconds, you will hold for 24 seconds, and exhale for 12 seconds. Use “bellow’s breath” technique in the morning.\n\n* Replace “should have” in your vocabulary with “next time”\n* Use the word “but” to overcome negative self–talk.\n* Focus on what you can work with. We waste so much time focusing on what is withheld from us.\n* Here’s what I want you to think instead: “I can work with this.”\n* It’s not easy, but I promise you that your life will be better if you choose to feel uncomfortable and make progress, rather than complain and make excuses.\n\nBefore rising, throughout the day, at the end of the day… Repeat (Phil. 4:13 - I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.”\n\nHighly recommend these books:\n\n\\- The Bible\n\n\\- The Tools by Phil Stutz &amp; Barry Michels\n\n***Talk to someone.*** There is no shame in reaching out to a licensed therapist.\n\n**SOCIAL:**\n\n* Talk to strangers\n* Drastically lower your social media use and approach the girl in person\n* Do not have a defeatist attitude, have a higher self-esteem\n* You have to put in the work.\n* \"Is there anything else I can do to help?\" went a long way when it comes to being an employee.\n* Empathic listening is a necessary skill if we want to make a real impact on other people’s lives.\n* Seek to understand others, then to be understood.\n\nRecommend this book: How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie.\n\n**PURPOSE:**\n\nChanging your beliefs isn’t nearly as hard as you might think. There are two steps.\n\n1. Decide the type of person you want to be.\n2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.\n\n* Find your broken windows and start rebuilding your house. What are some of your broken windows that need attending?\n\nQ1: “Am I doing what I love?”\n\nQ2: “What’s the worst that could happen?”\n\nQ3: “What is really the worst thing that could happen if (insert potential future bad situation here) were to come true?”\n\n* Mentally prepare: Visualize your success.\n* Deconstruct your fears.\n\nIf you have enough money to do anything possible on this earth, then what your ideal day would look like? You may have hundreds of options but what is that one thing that you would love to do not for one day, one week, or one month, but consistently for more than a year? Something that would keep you motivated.\n\n* Spend time, alone, to listen to yourself.\n* Pray/meditate.\n* Find what motivates and inspires you.\n* Brain dump/storm.\n\n1. Set four goals.\n\n* Set a goal in each of the following areas: Financial, Health, Career and Other.\n\n1. Measure your current situation.\n\n* Everything is temporary.\n* Our perspective dictates our reality.\n\nIf you don't know what skills to learn, or hobbies to pick up, experiment until you find one that you don't question anymore. If you don't know what purpose to devote your life to, ask yourself what endeavors you care about both in the moment and in the bigger picture - that's it. If you don't have a good answer to that, keep trying out things in life until one sticks. Picture your ideal moment - can be a memory or imagined. Make it as detailed as possible.\n\n**WAKING UP &amp; WORKING:**\n\n**Morning ramp-up**: Wake by 6/6:30am and get your lymphatic system moving and your mindset in check. As your energy rises, plan the day ahead.\n\n* Get positive: Start the day with a mantra.\n* Hydrate (water + LMNT/sea salt/pink salt)\n* Write down 3 things you are grateful for\n* Read 20 pages of a book.\n* Sunlight in eyes for 10 min - best thing for sleep, mood, metabolism (10 min of natural, bright, outdoor sunlight. 30 min if cloudy. contacts/prescription glasses are fine, but not sunglasses) maybe get a walk or sit in yard with coffee.\n* (try) No email, social media, but instead critical task (1 physical + 1 cognitive difficult tasks) OR walk/talk about challenging things for this 1 hour/90 min before caffeine.\n* Caffeine - Yerba Mate (90 min after waking - because adenosine receptors are not active &amp; will cause afternoon crash if you drink upon waking)\n\n**Morning peak**: Reserve this time for challenging work and new habits.\n\n* Meditate/pray for 30 min/fast/do breathing exercise (bellow’s breath). Set immediate achievable goals to not feel stressed and get focus. Make coffee/fill water. 90 minute work units: \\[Clarify what your want to achieve in the 90min\\] 90min of work w/ timer. No phone. After 90 min, get up, use bathroom, refill water, etc. Another deep work block for 90 min \\[2 a day\\]. Check phone for the first time after 2hr deep work block. Do a short workout to get some movement (short jog or workout). Get the priority task done before anything else. Shut down ritual. Batch messages and email replying after deep work (lunch). Do chores way before or after deep work.\n\n**SLEEP:**\n\n* **DON’T**: have coffee after 2pm, do highly energizing exercises or activities, watch screens one hour before bed, think or read about complex things before bed.\n* **DO**: whatever is RELAXING your body, mind, and soul: Take a hot shower/bath, go for a relaxing walk, stretch, mild exercise, yoga,  (Guided) meditation, writing, massage, drawing or any relaxing hobby, Drink something warm, Relaxation techniques, breathing exercises, Reading (printed) something relaxing or silly, Etc.\n* Have the same bedtime and wake up time every day.\n* Practice some relaxing bedtime ritual, exercise daily (some form or other)\n* No food or coffee/alcohol/cigarettes before bed, use evenings to relax and wind down. Have a comfortable mattress and pillow.\n* Keep your room completely silent when sleeping, as well as dark.\n* If needed, sleep with earplugs and an eye mask.\n* Try not to take (substantial) naps during the day.\n* Work on never using the snooze button in the morning, but get up immediately.\n* If you can’t sleep, do something relaxing until you feel tired…\n* Artificial light disrupts melatonin production, meaning if your lights are on at 10 pm, screens, or otherwise, it will affect your brain's natural schedule.\n* The best temperature for a sound 8-hour nap? 18°C to 19°C or 65°F Try to go to sleep by 10:30 pm +/-30 min\n\n**TIME-MANAGEMENT:**\n\n* Use the Pomodoro technique.\n* Breaking your day into chunks helps you be the best you as too much time spent doing one thing can cause you to lose focus…and interest.\n* Do the most important thing first each day.\n* Make a habit of scheduling your priorities rather than prioritizing your schedule. Manage your energy, not your time. Determine what tasks each energy level and time of day are best suited for.\n* Prepare the night before.\n* Do something poorly if it seems overwhelming. 80/20 rule - spend 20% of the effort to get 80% of the impact.\n* Pleasure activities are ones that give the high amount of dopamine. Whereas enjoyable activities also give dopamine, but also make you better at the task and will often produce a state of Flow. Enjoyment produces growth, pleasure does not.\n* Procrastination is basically just fear. Get started and keep going. As soon as you make a decision to do something, IMMEDIATELY take action towards that. And making lists doesn't count. Do the actual work! Or at least part of it.\n* Research is only useful until it becomes a form of procrastination.\n\nEisenhower Box: This simple decision matrix will help you take action, organize tasks, and get more done. Warren Buffett’s “2 List” Strategy\n\nThe root problem with many productivity issues is being constantly overstimulated.\n\n* Eliminate half-work at all costs. In our age of constant distraction, it’s stupidly easy to split our attention between what we should be doing and what society bombards us with.\n* Observe moments and times at which you are distracted. (Mindfulness)\n* Master the fundamentals now. You can optimize the details later.\n* If you want to be the type of person who accomplishes things on a consistent basis, then give yourself a schedule to follow, not a deadline to race toward. Focusing on your identity instead of your results or setting a schedule instead of a deadline or developing a pre–game routine.\n* Start telling yourself that the things you need to do are not hard; in fact they're very easy.\n\n\"I don't have time” = It is not a priority. Time is a choice, it is elastic. We have enough time, almost all of us. Get rid of things that take away most of your time on a daily basis. Focus on what matters and you will build the life you want.\n\n**FINANCIAL:**\n\n* Have an income.\n* Save. $50 per month, every month is a good goal.\n* Research how to invest.\n* Side hustle.\n\n**JOURNALING:**\n\nBenjamin Franklin used to ask himself this question every morning: “What good shall I do today?” The things we measure are the things we improve. What are you measuring in your life? It’s about the system, not the goal.\n\n* Use a Microsoft excel sheet for hours spent studying/working out, etc. (or simply write it down)\n\nAt the end of every day, set out a small but substantial goal for the next day and regardless of what you do the next day, you have to complete that task. Whatever else happens that day, you will have achieved something. 1). Identifying what are the 3 most important areas that require the max amount of work from me 2). What's the 1 thing that requires immediate attention in each of them 3). Start working on it from today! There's a technique called OKRs (Objective, Key Results). First, you set your quarterly objectives, which should sound AWESOME and INSPIRING. An example might be, \"Become an expert at making health-conscious decisions.” Then you back them up with MEASURABLE key results. \"eat 2 veggie meals per week\", \"go for 2 runs a week\", \"buy a blender and make 10 smoothies\"... etc. This method gives you the opportunity to flex your goals every 3 months and evaluate your progress.\n\n**Gratitude**: Write 3 things you are grateful for. Three words. Rewires your brain to think positively! Best for morning and night.\n\n**Daily To Do**: Every morning, the first thing I do is I list all the tasks I want to complete that day. At night, I check all completed tasks and migrate incomplete tasks to the next day. Make a daily to-do list on a post-it note (or that size) Write only 6 things to complete.\n\n**Morning Pages**: Write down 10 ideas. They can be big ideas (how to cure cancer) or small ones (ways get your cat to quit scratching the furniture).\n\n**Vision Journaling**: Write about your ideal life, your vision. What would my ideal life look like in 3 years, 5 years? “Dear diary…” a journal entry from your future self, an ideal day in the life.\n\n**Positive Worry**:  Helps in a short amount of time. “What if…” but put a positive spin on it.\n\n**Active Journaling (90-day goals)**: Sunday night/Monday morning\n\n**Habit Tracker**: Track the habits that you are trying to reinforce.\n\n**Monthly Calendar**: Use Google calendar or a paper calendar to keep up with special dates and appointments.\n\nWrite what you’ve done well that day, what I haven’t done well that day and what goals I have for tomorrow. Then, write down your goals for the next day on a white board. What are the struggles? Success? How does this help you understand your goals better? Start measuring success by whether or not you did the thing, not by how long you did it, how hard it was, or whether you noticed an improvement today.\n\n“What good have I done today?” - Benjamin Franklin’s day always ended with asking and answering this question.\n\nLearn how to learn, your attitude is crucial, chase experiences, go on a hero’s journey, don’t postpone your dreams, build quality relationships and cut out unfulfilling ones, learn something new (every day!)\n\n***QUOTES:***\n\n“Pick your sacrifice. Choose one thing. Doesn’t matter what. You only get one life, so you might as well pick the highest aim you can and live it.”\n\n\"Learn something about everything, and everything about something\"\n\n\"When the problem is in the mind, the answer is in the body\"\n\n\"Eighty percent of success is showing up.\"\n\n\"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\"",

I’ve been trying till now to take fun trips on birthdays and stuff, like going to theme parks, to help with this. But I guess it’s not enough. I’m not sure what to do and I’m even considering moving back to my hometown to be closer to family so at least she’ll have cousins to play with. \n\nI just feel sorry for us and I want to make friends but I’m honestly not even sure how to make friends at this age.",

The days where I don’t do anything are just spent on YouTube or doing my hobbies but besides that not much and honestly my lack of getting out of the house has really been affecting my mental state and just made me more sad and tired than ever. \n\nBut the thing is I always feel really guilty when I go out as my family has 5 dogs and my mom frequently complains about being left alone with them. She also has the same issue as she was telling me that she has spent 26 years locked up in the house bc of us and now the pets. So I never really saw from my parents how to spend time outside of the house and usually clubs and things were discouraged. \n\nSo now I have the question where are even good places to spend your time out of the house? I was thinking of joining a fitness class and maybe doing volunteering just to have something. Also I don’t have very many friends to hang out with and they usually don’t have very much time or desire to hang out and there aren’t any real good meetup groups as many of them don’t align with my interests or are completely full. So these aren’t a really viable solution. Thank you so much for any suggestions!!!",

I did good in high school chemistry (A), but in general chemistry in college I ended up with a C- in the class. I have never understood coding despite the million attempts to learn it. I feel as though probability is one of the hardest concepts for me to understand and I have never been able to grasp economics because the graphs and tables and charts and math was too much for me to handle. I simply refuse to believe that I am just bad at all things problem solving, but I just can't seem to figure out where I am going wrong. People say that I just need to practice more, but I am practicing. I can always understand the basic questions, but as soon as it gets to medium level or hard level difficulty, I can't think or process my way through it and I just end up stuck.

        "text": "    Hello everyone I would like to apologize now for how long this is and any grammatical errors I make (I will try my best). A friend and I (we will call him Bill) play video games together and we are always hanging out at each other's house. Well Bill has a terrible habit of interrupting people while they are talking and it gets to the point were I get so mad. Which makes me feel ridiculous because he is a good friend so I just stay quiet and let it roll off my back (I thought). About 3 weeks ago our small friend group was playing video games and Bill brought up Microsoft buying COD. Right as i was about to add to the conversation he interrupted me to repeat himself (like bro we are in a party chat/in game together we all can hear you) and asked if i knew that. I said yes, then he repeated himself again then ask another person if they new that. So i went to speak again, he interrupted me again to say the say thing and ask if a particular person knew about it.....to the everyone in the party chat....and after finally being able to talk once i stopped talking (and i mean THE second i stopped!!) he changed the subject...For some reason that sparked and anger that I have rarely seen from myself. At that moment I knew I needed to calm down so I logged off and went to take my dog for a walk. That's when I was hit with a realization. He did not give a damn about what I had to say!!!! He ran right over top of me this i was stupid and had nothing to add!!! I just ran away because I was angry!!! I have been bottling up my frustration for way to long!!! And if this guy is my friend then he shouldn't be bullying me in conversations!!! I decided from then on out I was not going to let him interrupt me anymore!!!\n\n    I needed a plan!! So I broke down the situation and was honest with myself. I don't like being interrupted (no one does) and I didn't like how he changed the subject once I was done. I want my words to hold weight in a conversation no matter the depth...and if you agree with me or not i am going to be heard and respected!!!\n\n    So for the past week whenever I start talking I do not stop untill I am done with what I have to say. And if I'm being honest starting was hard and very nerve-wracking. The first time I did it was....scary. I was scared he wouldn't care and just keep talk. Scared that I got so worked up for nothing. Even with those thoughts in my head I powered through it. I remained calm and kept talking until i was done. Which left me very surprised after about 2 or 3 time of him trying to interrupt me he completely stopped. He even stopped changing the subject once I finished talking!!!\n\n    My advice to anyone going through this, I'd to not give up no matter how awkward it is and no matter how you feel. Once I saw the results I felt like I gained respect for myself and a mile high confidence. Good luck and I hope this helps some people. Sorry if you suffered through all of this!! thank you!!!",

Sometimes I genuinely look really really forward to it—I don’t happen to have many close friends around and I’m finding that I get socially drained very quickly these days, so I don’t mind staying in lots of nights. \n\nI just feel this weird shame about it sometimes, though. Plus I’ve heard &amp; read lots of things about your mental state generally being worse the more you decide to get high. I know we shouldn’t care so much about what others think but basically I’m just wondering if anyone else has these mixed feelings about weed in general.

I suffer from severe social and generalised anxiety. It became too much for me and quit my somewhat adequate-paying, secure job at the time. I did some odd jobs over these 4 years and now I feel like I can try getting full time employment.\n\nHowever, when I look at my former colleagues, they have all been successful. They have better jobs at prestigious companies, are paid handsomely, travel abroad constantly, are starting families, buying homes, cars, etc. Meanwhile, I have none of this. Comparatively, I'm in a awful state. So I obsessively check their LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram and feel absolute shit as a result. I end up more depressed, sad, hopeless, etc. I end up feeling stuck as I can't progress because I'm feeling awful.\n\nSo how to fix this?\n\n**1. GET A SINCERE UNDERSTANDING OF WHY COMPARISON IS BAD FOR YOU AND WHAT IT DOES TO YOU**\n\nYou feel awful when you are depressed. You feel awful when you are sad. You feel awful when you have no hope for the future. This is what your comparison does to you. It robs you of your peace of mind, your joy, your energy, your creativity, your optimism. And you're just letting it happen? This is what I didn't get before. People always say \"Comparison is the thief of joy.\" I understood this on a surface level but today I guess I understood it. I'm literally letting myself get robbed of the things I need to make progress in life, I'm just giving them away.\n\nComparison will give you a nervous breakdown (for those with serious anxiety).\n\nComparison will stunt your progress. It will hold you back. It will keep you from solving the problems life throws at you. It will keep you from achieving a somewhat peaceful life.\n\n**2. HOW TO STOP THESE SIDE-EFFECTS OF COMPARISON FROM AFFECTING YOU AND YOUR LIFE**\n\nAll these comparison side-effects are bad for you. Why would you want any of them? You do not want to be depressed. You do not want to be hopeless. You do not want to be bogged down by sadness. You do not want to have a nervous breakdown. You do not want to be stuck and constantly suffering from the problems you need to fix.\n\nYou want the best for yourself. You want happiness, optimism, creativity, energy, and peace of mind. You want to feel the joy of solving life's problems. So how to get all these things?\n\n&gt;***a. Resolve to not compare under any circumstances.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When even the smallest thought of comparison creeps into my mind, I stop. I imagine myself giving up my joy, hope, and optimism that I need, to some nefarious person and I say NO. I need those things to make any progress in life. I'm not giving them to you (nefarious person ). I selfishly guard them.

Nothing else matters other than solving your current problem (achieving your current goal).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;d. Solving your problem (achieving your current goal) takes energy and looking at what others have takes so much energy and exacerbates your problems.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;e.

This is a great way for managers to gain greater insight on what it's like to work with you and the contributions you're making.\n\nThe same can be applied in your personal life. Reach out to a few close friends and ask them for feedback about you. How do they perceive you? Why are they friends with you? What value are bringing into their lives?\n\nThis is an easy and effective way to gain a greater understanding of yourself. It's not the only way, but it is simple and very insightful.\n\nYou'll be amazed to know just how much you matter to the people in your life!",

I wanted to become a man. But at the same time I can’t push myself to even work that hard to get there .\n\n\n I lost my infantry job because of it. I lost part of what was supposed to be my life because of it. I’m a weak person both mentally and physically. If I wanted to see combat I should of went the special ops route but my asvab scores were to low for that to begin with. I enlisted regardless and had a bad time in bootcamp. It made me realize the military want for me. I was too introverted and independent and liked to do my own thing. Plus I didn’t prepare enough for it and ended up losing my infantry job. So here I am, still weak and lacking in cardio are strength. I feel depressed at times, unmotivated to even live life sometimes.\n\n\n Now I’m in motor t. I’m at square zero. The failure of a lack of effort and understanding of what the job entailed got me here. If I knew how much I needed to do in order to get ready for the infantry Instead of figuring it out during bootcamp I would have never went in so early. I still have special ops in 2 years though that I can try out for but, it’s a long wait and I have to stick to my motor t job till then. It sucks so much and everyday is a constant reminder of my flaws in life. \n\n\nIt’s not the first time this happened. It happens with football to. It happens the same exact way.

Today’s prompt was **‘When someone asks how are you, say fantastic with a big smile’**\n\n**Before:**\n\nWe’re so programmed to say good when someone asks how we are and not really intrigue into the question or provide any genuine smiles.\n\nThis one feels like a nice addition, not relying on me opening up a conversation but instead, going into a conversation I’m already going to have and injecting it with a bit more happiness.\n\n**Experience:**\n\nTonight at Jiu Jitsu, before I started rolling someone asked me how I was and I said ‘fantastic’. It was interesting seeing his face because I saw a brief glint of surprise. People don’t answer that question properly so I think it was just a pleasant change of pace. We then had a good session &amp; had a natter throughout.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nI should answer the question: how are you, with the most up beat I can with strangers. I don’t know why I wouldn’t. It seems to have a positive contagion on those around me.\n\nOutside of just being slightly more upbeat, creating a happier conversation, I have found myself just having little conversation with strangers as I go about my day. People that I otherwise would have just ignored but instead, I make comments about the weather, ask questions about them and that’s quite amazing. I’m a really big fan of self development but I do think that there’s really no point until it’s practiced, so much time can be spent just looking at content of people doing things and me feeling like I’m getting something out of it just by listening. Doing the work like this feels very me and it's actually getting results which is amazing.\n\n**If you have any thoughts/ideas for prompts which I could use to slowgress towards confidence with strangers then lmk.**",

        "text": "So last night I was hosting a stall at an event fair, and one of my biggest fear came to life, I consider my self an extraverted introvert, because I love when people approach me and talk to me, but I hate approaching people,\n\nWhy you ask, because I used to think I had social anxiety but now I realised, I am just afraid of being ignored by people, like last night I had to pitch our idea's to people visiting the fair, meaning walking up to strangers, asking them for their time and pitching my idea's,\n\nThe first guy I approached looked at me, gave me a bad look and ignored me and I was sad, but I didn't lose confidence, I then approached this girl and she also ignored me that to in front of my colleagues ( which literally shattered all my confidence) and I lost all the hope and gave it a last shot, approached another girl, she stopped to listen and I stuttered in the middle of the pitch and she laughed and walked away.\n\nI told this to my roommate and he calls this a made up story, but I am literally in such disbelief that my worst nightmare became reality.\n\nAnd Now I have to pitch again today at the fair, how do I overcome my fear?",

After a year haven’t made a single friend which made me depressed which lead to not taking care of myself and a very unhealthy diet. All I do is smoke and eat snacks for now because I feel like I don’t have the genetics to excel. Last year I worked out for 6 months, went from 200 lbs to 172 lbs but my goal was 135-145 lbs also cleared my skin with diets and any other beauty hacks. I have up because on my last town I still wasn’t getting treated good and no one seemed to acknowledge it so I’m like screw it.\nI want to start but don’t know how, I don’t want to be super popular but I just want to be a more likable person. Is it possible to come from a loser to a more likable person? I’m 30 years old by the way.",

I know for a fact this is not a *perspective* thing or a *self-fulfilling prophecy* thing; this is because God or the universe or something doesn’t want me to be better. \n\nMost recently, I tried to have a more positive outlook, and my gf was involved in a (minor) hit and run accident. And the time I tried being positive before that, my grandpa died. And before that, I almost lost my job, and was sent to work in the night shift, which I’ve been doing ever since. \n\nThis is not a coincidence. This is not a matter of perspective or attitude. Something or someone wants me to be unhappy. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared that there’s only one answer, but I don’t want to do that, because that would scar my family for the rest of their lives. I don’t know what I need.",
