He tripped over some of our canary tokens/honeypots, as well as ATA, and my SIEM correlation rules for SMB scanning.  \n\nWe gave them a tap on our network FYI, whitelisted on our NAC the linux box they are using.(non domain joined/non compliant devices get sent to VLAN of death automatically, but that would defeat the purpose of this test).\n\nSo the linux box the tester is using is not domain joined as far as I know, and yet he is for some reason attaining successful logins to a domain controller we have.  The confusion I have is why he is able to produce \"successful login\" events to the domain controller despite using a username that does not exist in our AD.\n\nDoes he have a golden ticket already?  I am not understanding how he is doing this.  Obviously everytime any account authenticates to a domain joined box on the network, we get a duplicate successful login event from the DC, as well as the domain joined box being logged into.(we send the DC logs, and the endpoint logs to siem)  I did not dig enough to see if he was directly logging into the DC or a different box.  \n\nAny ideas as to what he accomplished, and for my own education, why I am seeing nonexistent accounts being used by him?  Only thing I can think of is he is forging tickets in mimikatz but I don't see the big picture.\n\n",

It takes millions of years to brute force a key for a modern algorithm (like SHA-256 et al), and when the key is *all* you can attack, brute force is all you have.

If it is not the lenovo one, it moves it to C:\\Windows\\system32\\0409\\zz_sec\\autobin.exe, and then writes it's own autochk.exe. During boot, the Lenovo autochk.exe writes a LenovoUpdate.exe and a LenovoCheck.exe file to the system32 directory, and sets up a services to run one of them when an internet connection is established. I don't know too much exactly what those do, but one appears to phone home to http://download.lenovo.com/ideapad/wind ... 2_oko.json which is a bit worrying with the combination of a \"ForceUpdate\" parameter shown and the lack of ssl, making it fairly likely that it's exploitable for remote code execution by anyone who can intercept your traffic(public wifi, etc).\n\nI'm planing on doing a system wipe when I get it, but hardware exploits seem to be unfixable.

        "text": "Ok, so. I am a little pissed off at a mistake I made today but I am turning here for help. \n\nSo, what happened:\n\nOne of my emails is my old university email. On this account (and others) I have used 2-step verification (gmail). However, on this account my telephone number is an overseas number to verify my account. Unfortunately, even after putting that sim card in a few times and resetting the phone, I cannot get to my messages for that number (no service). \n\nSo I turned to my university for help. After resetting the password and confirming the phone number on the account, this did not change the phone number listed on google when logging in. So the representative was like well I can't help you and you will have to contact google. So I asked him for a number. And he gives me one and I give them a call. \nAnd this is where it gets a bit shady and I cannot believe I didn't see the signs but here I am now..... \n\nI am on the phone with an indian sounding guy (Allen) who says okay we can help. I use a share my screen tool and he gets on my computer and tries a few things. and we're going back and forth, and whatever he is trying to do is not working. Here is where I think there is a breach of security: \n\nHe runs a program from the command line (terminal) and it runs a program which seems legit. However, retrospectively, I feel like he may have planted something on my (laptop) macbook pro. \n\nSo then he was like, ok, we can help you. We have to do a security program and the deposit will be 200 dollars and we will refund you. 200 dollars in itunes gift cards. So I was skeptical the whole time, but not skeptical enough not to buy the cards. F.\n\nSo I buy the cards and call them back. And they're like okay send us pictures of the cards. So I did. While I was waiting for them to \"fix the problem,\" I began researching paying for services with itunes gift cards and the results were not positive. \n\nThen we spoke again and at that point I knew they were scamming me. They asked for an additional 500 dollars as a security deposit in order to complete the service saying they were 50% there. So after some nasty words, they hung up and now I am out $200. \n\nI have pretty much accepted the loss of cash. \n\nTwo questions being: \nIs there anything I can do to check the security of my MBP?\nIs there anyway I can recover my university email? \n\nps: I know I wrote this in a scramble, so I will be reading it over and editing it, but I wanted to get it out asap so I could receive the proper help. Also, pretty shit I got a bad number from someone who is supposed to be reputable. \n\n***Update:*** First of all, thank you all for your thoughtful replies. After digging, I have found a way to get onto my international sim. I downloaded an app and added money to the card and bought a 24 hour roaming package. Now, I have updated the international number on my univ gmail acct to my american number. So, all set there. Anyway I will do the suggested below tonight from bob84900 and report back. thx bob and dillage and reapersgale.\n\n***Update 2:*** I have called the school and they are looking into it. Here is the (bogus) telephone number the school gave me: 1-888-815-6317. Have fun if you want. \n\n***Update 3:*** Spoke with the school and they are going to pursue the perpetrator and talk with google, while reporting the number. Anyway, I'm about to call my bank to see what they can do. \n\nThanks everyone for your help. In terms of my computer's security, it seems to be doing okay. A little slow on microsoft word, but I think that's the norm.",

Plus I am trying to understand which kind of MITM attacks are possible on these two different architecture.\nAs of now what I have is that : Centralize is easily maintainable, since there will only be 1 point of failure. It has a poor fault tolerance, since if you kill the head everything stop working. It doesn't scale well. It is really easy and quick to develop. The evolution capability is quite slow. Distributed are mainly the opposite, hard to maintain, very stable, infinite scalability, slow development phase (gotta work with all the trade and communication) and has a really good evolution when the infrastructure is in place.\nThank you guys and have a great day !\n\nPS: I first post this in IOT but since I am also searching for netsec answer I copied the text.",

I'm kind of nervous because I have 5 years exp as a sys admin but don't want to lose my touch and nervous because they said it was a non technical role.... Not sure what to do? Is moving into security less technical and more ideological and putting in controls and testing those controls and seeing that everyone is meeting the standards and in compliance? It's definitely something I'm interested in and may help me break into cyber security... but will it?   \nEdit: They did mention they would pay for certificates to keep me up to par because this industry requires it.

It just cuts the connection to the server.\n\nThe only thing that accepts and renders it in the page source are &lt;a&gt; tags. So I cand insert href to other websites.\n\nIs there any why I can execute js to trigger an xss in such circumstances?\n\n\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nThank you for your help guys. But it seems there is nothing there. No vuln.\n\nAs mentioned above, the website sanitizes and eliminates any of the following html tags. \n  \n     &lt;script&gt;\n     &lt;style&gt; \n     &lt;img src=...\n\nThe only thing that stays on the page and is inserted in the DOM is the &lt;a&gt; tag\n    &lt;a href=\"https://example\"&gt;It works&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt seems that the KW **javascript** and js syntax are not allowed. However, after encoding, I managed to insert \n\n     &lt;a href=\"jav%61script%3Aalert%281%29\"&gt;business&lt;/a&gt; \n\nWhich was decoded and inserted in the DOM as: \n\n     &lt;a href=\"javascript:alert(1)\"&gt;business&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHowever, upon inserting an a tag, the target attaches by default the attribute target=_blank. So even if I click to execute it, it will open into a blank page. So nothing.\n\nAs I notive that the href link is transported via the URL (so after clicking on a link, the address is appended to the target's URL). So I tried the payload (&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS');&lt;/script&gt;) in the href:\n\n    &lt;a href=\"%3cscript%3ealert%28%27XSS%27%29%3b%3c%2fscript%3e\"&gt;It works&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWhich when clicked, in decodes in the URL as follow:\n \n    www.example.com/&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS');&lt;/script&gt;/\n\nBut this is not executed, nor allowed. The url is opened in another browser tab and the server returns a 404 error:\n \n    *security system has detected suspicious activity*\n\nI also tried a payload for URI, with and without encoding. And the server doesn't let me insert it. \n\nBy now, I think I did try all I could. \n\nPS: someody ask about the target website. I can't disclose it. All I can say is that it has a public bug bounty program and participating to it is open for anyone. **Thank you for all your comments guys**",

It doesn’t seem to move independently, as in when no one is in the room, but as soon as it gets a moving person in view, it starts moving. \n\nThe camera still responds to controls on the provided remote, so we can still move it freely. However, it certainly seems now very much locked on auto tracking movement. \n\nI’ve switched the device off (both remote camera and charging cradle, which seems to serve as a kind a of central hub as it has an Ethernet port which you can connect to your wireless router), reset the controller to factory defaults, and setup the Uniden Baby Monitor app on my phone where I reset the default password to something much stronger. None of these actions seem to help. \n\nI’ve also noted now since I’ve disconnected the cradle/remote from the router via Ethernet that the app no longer allows remote connection to the camera. This indicates to me their is no wifi function in the camera or remote, and that instead a device like a phone is connecting to the router, then those commands are hen being parsed to the Ethernet connected remote, and then transmitted via radio frequency to the camera. That is just educated speculation, but seems to make sense. Happy to be corrected here by people more knowledgeable. \n\nIt should be noted, that even after hours of inactivity, and disconnecting the camera, once it’s plugged back in it will commence motion tracking immediately again. This indicates to me it isn’t someone actively watching and moving it. \n\nI have never attached these devices to the wifi network at home. The camera never required this be done, and I cannot see a way this can be done. \n\nI’m interested in anyone’s take on whether the device might be hacked? Alternate hypothesis are that perhaps it’s received some firmware upgrade automatically; or has bugged out and activated some software locked feature to auto track, that perhaps other more expensive models have, that are manually deactivated in lower end models. I realise that seems unlikely, I’m just spitballing. \n\nAny advice regarding this phenomenon would be appreciated, as well as tips on things to check, or ways to avoid it. \n\nP.S. I’m running wifi encryption with a reasonably strong password, have set a reasonably strong password for the wifi routers admin login, and haven’t ever suspected any hacking of my network before. I’m also inclined to think that not only is the device not connected to wifi,it actually doesn’t have a wifi network card in it.",

        "text": "Hi everyone. My devices have been persistently compromised for almost a year—I even hired an external consultancy firm, but ultimately couldn’t afford the fees needed to actually address the issue—and I’m running out of options. \n\nDespite having familiarized myself with most of the essentials (indicators of compromise, among others), not to mention having gone from totally tech-illiterate to tolerably capable in the span of a year, it’s become evident that a) I can’t manually eliminate every putative backdoor/shell/etc. on my own, and b) that wiping my devices is—and has been—an effort in futility.\n\nRE: the latter, I’ve confirmed and corroborated the presence of ‘non-local’ Wi-Fi networks pretty much everywhere I go, namely at home, my go-to cafés, and friends’ houses, and I’d rather not attempt to reset everything without elucidating how this has been happening. Ideally, I’d want to prevent it/ensure my home network setup is copacetic before relying on the latter to wipe and reset.\n\nTo wit, I’m somewhat familiar with the likes of Wireshark, Nmap, and some bash-based packet capture functions, but I’m not exactly confident of my capacity to discern what to look for, nor to accurately dissect what I find. I’m not even sure if those tools can do what I’m asking for. If it matters, I’ve configured USB-boots for a number of sec-based distros (if there happens to be a Debian- or Arch-based tool/package I should use).\n\nAny help would be greatly, greatly appreciated. I’d be happy to privately share some backstory if there’s any interest/need, but suffice it to establish that this is verifiably real, twisted, relentless, and unlikely to abate without volunteer assistance and/or my making like a ghost and moving to the woods.\n\n(And, yes, I did bring this to law enforcement. Pro-tip: Law enforcement only really cares about CP, apparently, and you will regret ever even engaging with them in the first place. Private civilians are basically f*cked.)\n",

        "text": "A lot of talk is swirling around lately about  a shadow operating system found in Intel CPUs.  Although no known virus or exploit is yet documented that leverages on the IME,  it is widely known that it could be utilized for remote access to a computer. Such remote access would bypass the OS, bypass antivirus, and whatever else exists on the targeted machine.   In this thread, we will dispel or verify the cluster of rumors swirling around IME  \"Intel Managment Engine\".\n\nCriticize and/or correct the following facts, liberally.  \n\n+ IME is part of the CPU, not the motherboard.\n\n+ IME is a full operating system running through firmware. It is a redux of MINIX.\n\n+ IME runs its own OS with its own dedicated CPU.\n\n+ Intel pretends IME is a \"Feature\", but failed to disclose its existence in any public way.  It was later \"discovered\" by a German security outfit.\n\n+ The National Security Agency (NSA)  became aware of the vulnerability posed by IME, and requested that Intel give them their own little \"switch bit\" to turn it off.  Intel's engineers obliged --- in a move that effectively admits guilt.  Netsec bloggers refer to this as the **\"NSA bit\"** now. \n\n+ This IME stuff was not implemented in Intel chipsets until about 2015.  It only effects certain \"generations\" starting from gen 6 and later. \n\n+ IME could be used to gain remote access to a machine over the internet -- in a way that is so drastic that some netsec experts call it a \"God Mode\". \n\nYour thoughts? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Given how wininit.exe is more of a \"host focused\" service, why does it need to chatter on most/all network interfaces at all? More importantly, what does wininit.exe speak? SMB? LDAP? NetBIOS?

I still don't have apache or any programs running on port 80. \n\nHow does it know it's filtered? Without the IPtable filter rule, doesn't the packet naturally get dropped thus Nmap would assume it's filtered? What makes the iptable rule special? What does a computer do with a packet coming to a specific port that doesn't have any programs/services opening a socket on that port number? Wouldn't it just drop it as if it was filtered? Or does my computer actually send something back to Nmap to say it's not filtered or open or anything? \n\nThank you. ",

I started learning some other things and I felt really cool and stuff (hence my username), but I feel like it's kind of stagnating and I don't know where to continue. I know some programming languages like Python and PHP (please don't judge me) and I have some *really* basic knowledge of C, C++, C# and Java (the fact that I put these languages in one group says enough). I roughly know how networks work and I know how to use Linux command line stuff. I know how some of the most common vulnerabilities and exploits work and how to use them, but if you gave me a website to pentest, I'd have absolutely no idea where to start. In a nutshell, I know enough about programming and hacking to know how much I actually suck at it.\n\nI just don't really know how to continue. Malware analysis seems pretty cool, but learning Assembly is a bit too ambitious for now. Maybe I should learn C?\n\nAlso, do you guys think Go is a good replacement for Python? Python is usually seen as a \"hacker language\", because of how easy it is to quickly write scripts to automate stuff and the huge amount of libraries for it. I've been thinking about learning Go, because it just looks really nice. Is it actually good for stuff like this?\n\nAny help is much appreciated. :)",
