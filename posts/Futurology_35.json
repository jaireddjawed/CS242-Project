Given enough time, players become so skilled that there is no longer any potential profit available for any of the players. This is when the players are said to have reached equilibrium.\n\nThis is how games die. Remember tic tax toe, when it always ended in a draw, that’s when you reach equilibrium. It’s when you stop playing, when there’s no chance to win theres no point in playing anymore.\n\nTrade is just a game, and it’s on its last legs. This comes with death and destruction, but there is a solution. You just need to play something else. Trade will inevitably be replaced very soon, the question is, what by?",

So to the energy you would need to create a wormhole that connects a place at Earth to near a blackhole would be greater than what would be needed to create a wormhole that connects Earth to let's say near Jupiter.",

There are already fast food restaurants that are completely automated. Delivery services are becoming more and more common to be carried out by robots. I also read an article about an AI “Judge” to preside over a court case soon. \n\nThings like this will become more common, maybe requiring human implementation, QC, maintenance etc. however even those steps could be replaced sooner rather than later.\n\nA random idea I thought of, although not realistic for many of us, is a professional streamer or YouTuber. I haven’t done much research in AI/robot creativity capabilities or theory, but content creation or live presentations of video games, product reviews, etc. I think will always require a human to be successful.\n\nThoughts?",

With this, in theory, people could make babies predisposed to being geniuses, predisposed to being stronger, with better immune systems, not to mention entirely prechosen physical features making them perfect in appearance, metabolism, etc. \n\nMy theory is, that within a decade maybe two this technology will become available for the uber-rich, and they will begin on a large scale, that is, without the intervention of the government, literally manufacturing perfect babies. \n\nI think that due to this within a few decades there will be a class of extremely wealthy \"perfect babies\"\n\nThe wealthy will keep the technology unavailable for middle and lower class individuals so that these communities can't make their own perfect babies, and in turn, perfect babies will see themselves as superior, and will likely become the new ruling class both economically and politically\n\nThere are so many possibilities with CRISPR that could be used for good, but I think it's likely due to elitism these technology will be only available for the hyper rich and therefore will create a class of people who see themselves essentially as above human.",
