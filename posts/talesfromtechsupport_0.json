        "text": "This is the conclusion of a 5 part series:  \n  \n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/z7jatb/back_on_the_help_desk/  \n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/zgjcrd/back_on_the_help_desk_part_2/)  \n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1049uc8/back_on_the_help_desk_part_3/)  \n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/10rcu9h/back_on_the_help_desk_part_4_pittsburgh/) \n  \nKnoxville.\nI thought I was clever. I’ve given myself an entire day tomorrow to make my way from Pittsburgh to Knoxville, where I’m going to review the security of a call center for GreyGoo’s users.   \nCall centers are pretty easy to review from a security perspective. Look at HR policies for background checks, walk the floors to see if the clean desk/clean screen policies are followed and fiddle with a shred bin to look like I care about such things. Ask to see proof of a few things. Note how well controlled entrances are and call it a day. I’m anticipating more work in deciding which barbecue restaurants I’m going to visit than this review.  \nThat was before I got emailed by Barry, the site manager. Barry had questions to almost every part of this review.  My page-long agenda and document request with color coded areas of interest ‘lacked specificity’ and that he wanted me to pre-write any questions for the staff at his call center. Also, he explained that any documentation would be not made available, despite a pile of NDAs threatening the sternest outcomes.  A few back-to-back emails got exchanged while I was stretching my legs or getting fuel between the Pennsylvania border and Charleston, WV. It seemed that my tires were working like a shitty prayer wheel, collecting cc:’d managers in BigCorp in this email chain.    \n  \nI decide to stop at a small town public library and call Barry to resolve this. Miracle of miracles, I get him on the second ring.  \n  \nBarry:”Barry, Site Manager here”  \n  \nMe:”Hi. This is LawTechie. We’ve been emailing back and forth and I wanted to see if I can better explain what I’m doing to ease your concerns”  \n  \nBarry:”I don’t have concerns. I’m afraid that you’re ambushing us with this vague and unclear audit. If you can’t be more clear with the requests, I’ll have to cancel it”  \n  \nMe:”. This is a repeat of last year’s assessment. Same agenda, just making sure nothing material has changed to your risk”  \n  \nBarry:”We didn’t have an audit last year. It’s uncalled for to you to demand one with so little notice”  \n  \nNow that’s interesting.  \n  \nMe:”You agreed to it. I’m not going to ask you anything you needed to prepare for. By the way, can I see the documentation I asked for?”  \n  \nBarry:”You can see whatever you want when you’re here. I’m reserving the right to stop the audit if I feel you’re playing games. Call me when you get to the building and I’ll have security let you in”  \n  \nMe:”Sounds good. I’ll see you at 8am tomorrow”  \n  \nBarry hangs up without fanfare.  \n  \nI think I’m going to regret the early start.  \n  \nI enjoy the winding West Virginia and Kentucky roads, finally making it to a mid-range hotel not too far from food, drink and the call center.  I avail myself of the food and drink a little too much and pass out in my hotel room.  \n  \nMy alarm wakes me up and I regret the early start. In room coffee, leftover barbecue followed with a shower to clean off the bbq and remove wrinkles from my dress shirt and I’m at least presentable and coherent, if not happy to be earning IHG points.  A quick negotiation with the desk clerk lets me check my duffle bag and riding suit so I can ride a bit more lightweight to the call center.  \n  \nI’m at the call center at 7:58. There’s no guard at the gate and Barry’s not answering his phone.  \n  \nThe call center is fenced on three sides, with the back running up to a gentle hill. The adjoining properties are other industrial/office park buildings, without fences. I decide to go exploring.  \n  \nAt the end of one fence, a well-worn footpath connects the two properties. It’s easily passable to pedestrians and now, at least one motorcyclist. I park my motorcycle next to a small loading dock at the side of the call center. I try Barry again, only to hear the standard Avaya voicemail prompt.  \n  \nI hop up on the loading dock and note a door wedged open. That door leads to a storage room with industrial shelving. I make my way into more office-like areas and press my phone to my ear to make it look like I know what I’m doing. Eventually I find myself in a field of half-filled cubicles with a buzz of clicking keyboards and hundreds of customer service related conversations filling the air. Thankfully someone has put fake street signs at the corridor intersections for navigation. I stop to take a selfie outside an unoccupied cube with a “Gay Street” sign on the outside, then figure out where the conference room is.  \n  \n  \nThe conference room is unoccupied. I set up my laptop, note pad, then write “I’ll be back in 5- getting coffee” on a handy white board. Somehow this is more difficult than my other tasks this morning. Barry or BigCorp has selected a painfully complicated K-Cup knockoff dispenser that uses something resembling a soy sauce packet and a miniature caulk cylinder. Eventually I figure it out and come back to the conference room with a “ONE BIG TEAM” branded coffee mug full of caffeinated liquid.  \n  \nTwo people are parked in the conference room, a man and a woman. I introduce myself and we engage in some pleasantries, as is expected this far from the Northeast.  \n  \nSo far, we have:  \n  \nSandra, the Operations Director. She’s in charge of IT, phones and The Reactor application, which seems to be more than just the back end to customer service. She’s grandmotherly, but carries the vibe that she has dug some man-sized holes in the woods when things went bad.  \n  \nJohnny, the jocular Recruiting &amp; HR head. He’s a storyteller. If I weren’t hung over, I think I’d invite him out to swap some tales over a pitcher of beer.  \n  \nNo Barry.  \n  \nSince I don’t have specifics on the call center operations other than how other companies do them, I’m going to ask about how things are going- upgrades, changes or problems. I don’t realize that this sounds just like the ambush Barry was accusing me of.  \n  \nSandra, Johnny and I have polite conversations about operations, new business applications and we’re starting to get into any incidents they’ve had.  \n  \nSandra starts talking about outages with both their incoming phones and the Reactor application caused by networking difficulties.  \n  \nI’d like to learn more and I’m about to have her expand when my phone rings. I think it’s Barry. To be polite, I inform Sandra &amp; Johnny that I’m going to put him on speaker.  \n  \nBarry:”Lawtechie, are you late?”  \n  \nMe:”No. I called and left you a few voice mails, then let myself in.”  \n  \nBarry:”That’s rude. I’ve been waiting for you out front\"  \n  \nJohnny pipes up:”Barry, we’re in Conference room B”  \n  \nBarry is trying to do a few noisy things while mumbling incoherently. I apologize to him and hang up.  \n  \nMe:”Sandra, while we wait for Barry, can you give me a bit more detail on the networking issues?”  \n  \nA few minutes of back-and-forth gives me the lay of the land:  \n \n  \n* Staffing the call center is harder than it looks. Seems that slow hiring processes are a front end bottle neck and the ‘dynamic, fast paced sales driven’ environment with low wages make retention hard. Johnny thinks this is because people just don’t want to work any more.\n  \n* Johnny definitely wants to give his answer to your question. The above about the staffing problems was a basic question about their background check vendor.\n  \n* Voice Over IP services and internal network support are handled by two different vendors who don’t really coordinate technical changes well. Sandra would like to make them work better together, but she doesn’t have management buy-in to threaten them.\n  \nI ask more details about outages, since she brought it up.   \n  \nSandra:”For example, last week, the VOIP vendor wasn’t able to route traffic to our back end. We couldn’t initiate outgoing calls for a few hours”\n  \nBarry enters the room with some force. He’s out of breath. He stands there, staring at us with clear discomfort. He puts his hand on the table to steady himself, then slides into a chair like a collapsing building.   \n  \nWe’re all silent for a minute, then it gets awkward. I start the conversation with Sandra back up again.   \n  \nMe:”So, why did routing break?”  \n  \nSandra:”Our network vendor did an replacement of one of our two routers. When the new router came back up, the phones went down for three hours.”  \n  \nMe:”That sounds like the fail over fell over. Couldn’t they just disconnect the new router until business hours?”  \n  \nA rumbling noise comes from Barry, now leaning forward.  \n  \nBarry:”The AI that controls the routers decided to tell the firewalls to block the traffic”  \n  \nThis sentence throws me. If Barry had decided to speak in tongues at this moment, I’d just get syllables. If he had a stroke, the words wouldn’t make sense.  \n  \nBut these words sort of make sense. They kind of parse, but they sound incorrect. They’re wrong in the way that makes me question what I know. Maybe Palo Alto is selling fully self aware AI firewalls and I haven’t been paying attention. I ponder Barry’s words while I hear my imposter syndrome warm up.  \n  \nYou know when some application like Chrome or Slack decides to max out CPU and your fans kick on? This is what’s happening. The app is trying to parse content while it worries that it’s ten thousand bad decisions wrapped around a core designed by amateurs.   \n  \nI don’t know how long I just sit there, thinking about Barry’s explanation.   \n  \nMe:”Ah. Ok. Who controls this AI?”  \n  \nBarry:”Our networking vendor”  \n  \nI want to meet these people. If they sold Barry the Skynet support package, I’m not even going to rat them out. I just want to find out what the Kentucky equivalent for ‘chutzpah’ is.  \n  \nI’ve learned all I’m going to from Sandra. I let her know I’ll have follow up questions and get her and the vendors’ contact info before letting her go back to her day.\n  \nI switch to Johnny about some dull HR things, like training, write up policies and the like. He meanders, occasionally telling a story.   \n  \nI take notes, thinking I can figure out the answers for my checklist later. I think I’ve answered these questions.   \n  \nOccasionally, Barry says something. Nothing’s been as crazy as the AI thing. He does like to hear his own voice.   \nI decide I have what I needed from Johnny as well. I do need to review some policy and training documents, which unfortunately are hard copies in Barry’s office.   \n  \nBarry hands me a few three ring binders and talks at me while I leaf through them looking for the dull stuff, like non-disclosure and acceptable use clauses, security training and background checks.   \n  \nBarry:”Do you think you’re going to stab me in the back?”  \n  \nMe:”No, Barry. I’m not here to stab you. Isn’t there something else you need to be doing?”  \n  \nBarry:”You’re just trying to make me look bad with your breaking into our office.”  \n  \nNo, Barry. You’re doing fine on your own.  \n  \nBut I don’t say that.  \n  \nMe:”Barry, I didn’t break in. I parked in the parking lot and walked in. The more you complain about it, the more I need to discuss it in my report. The faster I complete this, the faster I’m out of your hair”  \n  \nBarry harrumphs over to his desk and starts looking at his PC monitor. He might be working, he might not.  \n  \nFifteen tense minutes later, I can say that I’ve looked over the same training materials and policies I’ve seen ten times over. I look at my phone and see that Sandra has been so kind as to forward me their networking vendor’s name and phone. I have what I need for this trip and I’d like to be gone.  \n  \nMe:”Barry, I’d like to thank you for your time. Someone in Vendor Management will be in touch in a few weeks for any follow up”  \n  \nBarry walks me out grumpily. I walk to my bike and decide to call the networking vendor contact. I get their voice mail.  I leave a short message, then put my helmet and gloves on.  \n  \nWith Barry watching, I ride back out the way I came, over the hill. I try throwing a rooster tail of dirt, but don’t manage it. I ride back to the hotel, retrieve all my luggage and gear. I bungee my duffel bag to the bike, change into the riding suit in the parking lot. Then my phone rings. It’s Neil, from the networking vendor.  \n  \nNeil:”Hi there. Is this LawTechie?”  \n  \nMe:”It is. I wanted to ask about an outage you all had at BigCorp”  \n  \nNeil:”Sure, sure. Sandra told me you’d be asking. Got a minute for a story?”  \n  \nMe:”Sure”  \n  \nNeil tells me about a router change out. He goes into enough details that I decide it’s easier to walk into the hotel and get a note pad and pen than to dig out my notebook in my nicely bungeed duffle bag. Nobody in the hotel seems to mind my return in a highlighter yellow suit. Neil’s story boils down to:  \n  \n* The switch-out was scheduled at 6AM to avoid downtime.\n* They powered down the old router a few minutes after starting.\n* They validated that the failover worked successfully and that there was no interruption to the phone center, both for incoming and outgoing calls. \n* They had the new router in the rack and lit by 6:30 or so. It routed traffic and everything was fine.\n* They were out a little after 7AM. They didn’t get called about the phone outage until two hours later.\n* The VOIP vendor had changed the IP addresses for some of their infrastructure, which wasn’t communicated to Neil’s team until the outage. They were able to fix it once they found the misrouted ticket.\n  \nSomehow everybody conflated the router cutover with the outage. Neil decided it was a better look to apologize than explain.   \n  \nMe:”Thanks. Can I ask one question: Did you tell Barry that you had AI?\n\n  \nNeil:“Does Barry seem to be an intelligent man?”  \n  \nMe:”I don’t want to say anything mean, but go on”  \n  \nNeil:“I tried explaining load balancing and firewall rules as simply as possible to him. Somehow he decided that ‘algorithm’ was the same as AI.  I didn’t want my lunch to get cold so I said yes”  \n  \nNeil and I have a laugh for a minute, then hang up.  \n  \nI start my bike and prepare to get on the road. My phone buzzes. Like an idiot, I check to see its cause. I see it’s an email from Barry. He wants to get the first draft of my report.   \n  \nI turn my phone off and ride south. While I’m annoyed by the day, I’m looking forward to the ride to North Carolina. I’m getting to ride for work and bill my employer mileage.  \n  \nI win.",

        "text": "Another part of the ongoing reprographic saga. Well it's been eventful these last couple of months. Ofsted didn't fail us, and Mick remains suspended. I gave my care and feeding of MFPs speech to a couple of hundred grudging faculty. We're looking around for new printers for when our contracts up in October. \n\nAll we have to do is keep Bob going til then. Unfortunately he must know that, because he's not making things easy for us. \n\nIt started, typically with a minor fault with the inbuilt stapler this afternoon, it was kicking sheets out of alignment. All it needs is an engineer to perform a quick alignment so we ring the non-ermergency service number. Engineer comes out Thursday afternoon, adjusts the spindle assembly, and job done. Bob works all day Friday fine, and I shut up the office for the weekend with no inkling that the following Monday was gonna suck any more than than usual. \n\nI arrive on Monday morning to find my boss swearing a blue streak at Bob, who is conspicuously broken, judging by the red service light on the upper section. Any job being sent through Bob causes his user interface, where we manually set the job up, to freeze then Bob crashes with an error code none of us have seen before and doesn't appear in his tech guide. this warrants a service call, who once they're convinced this is a new issue, tell us this is a critical error and not to use the machine.\n\nSince Bob isn't usable anyway we attempt to shut him down. One of the less user friendly features about Bob is that doing so is software based, rather than a hard switch. Trying to shut him down causes only a crash restart. The actual power button will not switch a machine on, only a powered down machine on. But holding it down midcrash at least makes it go to sleep. Bob will not switch off if he has a red service light. \n\nAnd so it's business as usual til that afternoon until an engineer from the MFP team comes for a gossip. He's not qualified to work on a high performance diva like Bob so we don't ask, but mid-cuppa he comments on what a POS Bob's model of printer is. To be honest no-one has a nice word to say about him. I guess we hurt Bob's feelings because he starts smelling properly hot. Engineer switches him off at the plug, and all is done to make sure that if it goes then it won't take us with it by moving toner canisters and paper boxes away. (some paper we use requires prepping by storing it next to the machine for 24 hours, lord knows why)\n\nOn Tuesday morning the High Performance engineer comes. He's never seen the error message before, runs some diagnostics and fiddles a bit. nothing happens. He then announces that Bob is dead. I grieved. I really did. Especially because we're getting into exam season. Some more diagnostics and it's eventually worked out that its only Bob's finisher that is dead. His external paper module, and print drum appear to still have some function. \nNaturally this has to be tested, so Bob's finisher unit is taken off and wheeled away to be dealt with in a moment. For reference this unit alone is about 2 feet long, 4 feet high, and 2 feet wide. This leaves us with the paper module and the processing unit with a gaping hole where paper would normally travel through to the finisher. After cherry picking a job that has no finishing but a decent number of pages we set it up. Muggins here (myself) has to crouch in front of the hole ready to catch the sheets as they come out. The author would like to inform you that this is a stupid idea. One the sheets were very hot, two the engineer admitted this wasn't health and safety friendly, and three the paper came out fast and went everywhere. \n\nExperiment over, he went back to knocking the finisher about. Fuses were replaced, the assemblies taken to bits, a lightly burnt board replaced. nothing worked. Becaus of what HSE would say about a gaping hole in moving parts, the finisher is reconnected. But after 7 hours of work, and on the verge of giving up, the reconnected finisher springs to life after the engineer redownloads some firmware. Somehow adjusting that spindle had deleted firmware to a third of the machine. (possibly with the help of the burning board). Engineer departs, calling Bob a finicky piece of work. Big mistake. \n\nHe now jams repeatedly jams in the external paper module. We haven't called the engineer out because its paper and usually our problem. Its generally a stacking error (some paper really does need to be stacked the right, shiny, way up) or isn't prepped, or hasn't been fanned properly to remove excess dust or glue. Or the wrong paper is used (cheapo 75 gsm rubbish). You get the picture. Basically I'm finishing the day covered in white powder and toner scratched to hell by being shoulder deep to unjam him, but Bob's still misbehaving, just not enough for my boss to authorise a callout. \n\nHe almost died this time, but we've still got til October to see what he throws at us this time.",

        "text": "So this might not be tech support but I worked for a fiber ops company running cables. Splicing street joints, going into pits, testing end to end at sites, etc, etc.\n\nOne day we go into a big building (have to check in with security) and the guard leads us the fiber room (a small room way out the way that only we have a key for) the guards says \"Oh we dont have a key for that room\" our usual response \"All good, its an Optus key so only fiber techies have it\" and we open the room and get to work.\n\nA few minutes later while we were running tests, the head of security comes past to check on us and seemed nice. We pack up, lock the door and leave. No problems.\n\nAbout a month or 2 later, we go back to the same building for another fiber run. We check in with security and get escorted to the door but something is off. The door is not as far down the hallway as last time. We ask the security guard to open the door and he checks his keys and says \"oh I dont have that key\" we can tell its not an Optus key either so the guards calls his manager (who takes 15 minutes to come down) and when he walks up he looks pretty smug and we ask about the door.\n\nHis reponse was \"I didnt have a key to that door so I put a door infront of it that only I have the key to because I dont trust it.\" We just looked at him stunned like WTF. We still got in, did our work and left.\n\nThis is one of many stories about power mad security managers I have from working in fiber.",

So I wanted to share! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a good friend who had a pop-up coffee shop for a while now, with several employees and all that; he is a great barista. He rented a space downtown which he wanted to be his most prominent Coffee spot, the next step up. He struggled quite a lot at first, and people rarely stayed even though it looks incredible and is comfy.\n\nI suggested he'd set up a media server. Maybe if you add more \"ambiance,\" it would help. His only objection was the price, so I offered to set him one up with a raspberry pie I had lying around. I took an hours-long \"coffee shop ambiance\" background noise and put that really quietly behind the music he figured they should play.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been running for a few weeks, and he says it really makes a difference. People come and stay, some study, others hang out with friends, and so forth. Ordering several coffees and cakes and whatnot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's only babbling in the background no real conversations, but now he got the idea of playing around with the ambiance more than just \"people chatting and jazz music.\" We'll see how it goes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suggested making a Lord of the rings Lofi backdrop, but that's only because it's my favorite.",

        "text": "I work for a tech company with a contract for a big, scary government agency. We manage multiple systems at lvl 1 and triage escalations to other contractors for higher support for tens of thousands of users across the country. My calls can range from \"I forgot my password\" and \"Skype can't find my camera\" to troubleshooting backscatter x-ray rigs, \"The wifi on \\[XXXX Ship in the Pacific Ocean XXXX\\] can't connect to the VPN,\" and configuring air traffic control tower access.\n\nAt least once a week, I get calls from civil servants who forget where they work. This one was the latest.\n\nI had just finished raising at ticket to external troubleshooters about something serious, one where I had to call through to their management because it would affect industries in that part of the country for the next 72 hours. The moment I was halting my phone after to take lunch, I get a call from a mid-tier dumbass, let's call him DACS  \n\n\n&gt;DACS: I need bigger email  \n&gt;  \n&gt;FB: Excuse me?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DACS: I *need* bigger email because I need to send so many important reports and documents, and they're just so big they won't send  \n&gt;  \n&gt;FB: OK. How big are these emails?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DACS: *I don't know* they're just clearly too big, and you know, it would be **nice** if I could send them all at once because...(3-minute story about whatever he was working on)\n\nDuring that time, I checked his account for locks and holds, any recent issues with the message exchange. It all came up clean.   \nSo, just for fun, I looked him up in the internal directory. \n\nHe came up flagged as one of the kids in a graduate program - I'd seen them before: they get hired at a higher salary entry level with some extra individual responsibility, then after 2 years, they automatically get promoted to management of a small team... without any greater responsibilities.  \n\n\n&gt;FB: (After he finished the story) Alright, I can see that that's very important. But, how big was the *last* email you sent?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DACS: \\*sigh followed by silent beat\\* 22MB and that's a small one  \n&gt;  \n&gt;FB: The agency-wide mail send limit is 26MB. No one can send any emails bigger than that.\n\nBut something smelt fishy, so I remoted into his machine.\n\nSure enough there was the email with a 22MB spreadsheet attached... and a 13MB PDF, and 15MB document. He also had a signature block which used chunky external fonts and a *full resolution banner*. A blank email was about 5MB for this guy.  \n\n\n&gt;FB: \\*Waving the cursor around the attachments\\* You're not allowed to do this. You need to send each of these as separate emails  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DACS: I told you I need to send them all at once because they're really important, and they're already late because Lookout kept crashing when I'd send them one-by-one  \n&gt;  \n&gt;FB:...What?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DACS: I need to send all of my files for each--  \n&gt;  \n&gt;FB: No. The part about Lookout crashing  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DACS: *Yeah* it's been happening for weeks, you should know about it. Every time I attach something to an email, it crashes when I send it\n\n  \nThis was exactly what had been happening during an **agency-wide incident** about a month before. Every branch was given instructions on how to resolve it, and every civil servant was expected to follow these instructions within 48 hours of it going out.\n\nSo, while still remoted in, I search for the email and there it was - it was unread.\n\n&gt;FB: \\*With the email open\\* If you'd have followed this 4 weeks ago, you wouldn't be having this problem'  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DACS: I don't read *general* mail. I figured one of you would come fix it eventually.\n\n  \n\\*CYA Mode Engaged\\*   \nI made sure to include this exchange and the fact he refused to do the fix for weeks in my ticket under the non-public notes for managers and other techs\n\nThen I took him through the 15-minute process of doing the fix, where I was interrupted by the following exchange --twice!\n\n&gt;DACS: So, when this is finished, I'll be able to send bigger emails, right?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;FB: We'll get to that. But, I'm sure you can agree, that to send **big emails** you need to be able to send emails at all, right?\n\n  \nWhen I sent him on his way, he still didn't understand the issue with the mail send size. Even after putting him on to the secure file transfer portal specifically for agents like him sending sensitive files to external actors, he kept asking me about what it had to do with giving him more email space.\n\nThat particular civil servant never finished the graduate program, and had an unexceptional career without promotion in the service, moving to another agency shortly after this call.",

        "text": "Way back before Y2K I was working for an MSP. One of our customers was complaining that their receptionist PC was slow and I got tapped to venture out past the M25 (London Orbital motorway) and deal with it.\n\nYou'll remember how a lot of web sites and dial-ups would have their own menu bar that could integrate into early versions of IE. Usually from ISPs with extra functions for their clients. Well other companies got into the habit of doing this. You could have them stacked.\n\nA full 50% of the IE display was full of these extra menus. Got rid of most of them and then dug deeper.\n\nPopups. Popups galore. Most of them just annoying, some of them insidious and resistive to removal except when using dark arts. \n\nThen we get down and find that the person likes Christmas Tree Lights resident that stays there. Remove that. \n\nThen we get down into the fun of their mailbox. This was Outlook Express. They have kept every single email. The mailbox is called reception and its got years of history .. all of it \"vital\" to the business (yet strangely not backed up).\n\nIn the end we built receptionist a new workstation, had to do a major bit of mailboxfix work archiving out old mail and then locking the entire environment down along with a backup. Our sales guy was happy, lots of extra work (charged by the hour) and a new workstation and setup charges. The customer was probably wondering what hit them at the next invoicing point.\n\nTLDR; receptionist pc infested with IE menu strips .. fix finds multiple other issues.",

That day, i was unlucky.\n\nIt was one of their higher-ups in HR\n\n\"Hello, how can i help you?\"\n\n\"YOU FU*+&amp;?# IDIOTS, WHY DOESN'T MR. X HAVE HIS PC YET?! HE CAN'T WORK!\"\n\n\"Excuse me, who? I can't follow.\"\n\n\"THE NEW ONE, YOU INCOMPETENT A*&amp;##/&amp;!\"\n\n\"We don't know about a new employee at your site, so we'd need a official infor-\"\n\n\"GIVE HIM THE FU*+_#;/ HARDWARE!\"\n\n\"I can't do that without official information, according to... Paragraph 12 of our cooperation contract. Also i must advice you to calm down and consider Paragraph 36 of Said -\" (12 states the need for official information to get stuff and 36 allows the one sided cancellation of the service, in case of a loss of professionality or threads towards somebody)\n\n\"DON'T CARE. DO IT, YOU ******\"\n\nAt that point i just put him on hold, looked at my collegues, who heard him scream through my phone across the room.\n\n\"I'll give him to the boss. I'm not getting payed enough for that shit.\"\n\nBack on the phone \"Sir, i'll put you through to our boss and you can get that done with him.\"\n\nHalf an hour later, out boss comes in and gives us the order to go and provide Notebook, Monitors and so on\n\nSo i drive to their office, unlock the door (our contract requires that we have direct access to any rooms containing our Hardware, this will get important later) and carry my stuff inside, Put it down and go to their boss\n\n\"Hello, here to provide the Hardware for Mr. X.\"\n\n\"What? Who? Why didn't you announce yourself?!\"\n\nHe than physically shoved me out their office and slammed the door. Now annoyed, i just shrug and drive back to my office. \n\nMy boss asked, why i'm back so fast. I tell him the Story and he just rolls his eyes \"I'll call them\"\n\nA bit later he orders us to go back the next day (already late on the current day) and finish the job\n\nThe next day, i'll drive their to find our, that they let the locks get changed and i can't enter\n\nMy boss calls them again and gets the answer that we wouldn't be allowed in anymore because we would disturb their Work.\n\nAfter that stupid phone call, we shut down their entire Server Rack. Their Boss called me a Minute later, why nothing was working and i told him, that we shut everything down, because a technician isn't able to access it, and we need to prevent overheating issues (their server room is famous for ~60°C air temp, because no AC, no windows, nothing, which actually breaks contract again) and protect our stuff\n\nHe begins to yell at me, threatens me and i just put him to my boss.\n\nFew months later, i get send back to their office, and, because they didn't let us in, which voids our contract and so, we sued them. It took me any my collegues 2 Trailers, but now they don't have any Hardware from us anymore",

        "text": "We're a women-owned suburban tech repair shop.  *Fortunately*, unreasonable people are few and far between. Yes, I've read all your stories and acknowledge our good fortune.  \n\nThis winter, though, heaven save me from irritable, non-tech-savvy men. They've all come in a batch recently.   \n\n1. Right before Christmas, Sir brings in a broken device: cracked screen, in contact with water.  Left deposit.  When we got it open and attempted the repair, we found more water damage than initially thought.  Called / emailed options, answered questions, provided more info *(non-tech-savvy Sir wanted to check our diagnosis by looking at pictures of the corroded board)*, then we waited for his choice. And waited.  And waited, occasionally checking in to restate the options and ask for his choice.  After a month of waiting on his decision, I get a nasty email, he criticizes me for inconveniencing him *(I gave my team extra vacation days between Christmas/New Year's)*, chastises me for putting employees before customers, complains about our lack of answers and options. Deep breath, polite reply. He comes into the shop next day, hadn't read my reply.  He won't see why we can't magic the repair his way, and when I patiently restate why his device doesn't work that way.  He shakes his finger in my face, \"Don't argue with me!\"  I take a deep breath, concur, and ask him not to shake his finger in my face.  \"Oh, lady... that does it,\" he says, and off he rants. Evidently, I'm stupid, I'm a c\\*\\*\\*, I'm a b\\*\\*\\*\\*, our service sucks, he's going to get a lawyer and ruin us, etc.  I tell him to get out, refund his deposit *(minus PITA fee)*, and give him the pieces of his device.  He sneers, \"I bet you're still single\".  I lean across the counter and tell him that not only have I been happily married for 27 years, but my 5 adult children are also still talking to me.  It takes him to the door to think up a retort for that, but on the way he throws more female curse words.  His parting retort is that my LH is an idiot for having put up with me for so long. *eye-roll*.  I've never in my life been cursed at like that (*thankfully*), and by such a \"successful businessman\".\n2. Sir orders a computer for his son. It takes longer to build than usual and we take customer service seriously, so I upgrade it as compensation for the delay. He refuses the accidental damage warranty at checkout \"let's keep the cost down\", we set it up, he goes home.  Two weeks later, he's back snapping at my female tech because the computer isn't working.  When we open it, see obvious corrosion all over the boards and call him with options.  Sir comes in.  He leans over the counter, insists the corrosion happened in my shop (*like we're too stupid to keep liquids away from electronics*), demands we prove that it didn't, and vehemently denies being offered the extended warranty.  He criticizes our integrity, and skill. Demands that I stop 'being defensive' as I explain our certification process *(the only proof he's going to get)* and insists he's the one not raising his voice. *(ie, the woman is the emotional, irrational one in this exchange.)*  What he really wanted was to bully the woman and young techs into a refund when he didn't meet the conditions for refund.  He refused the warranty, the computer was ruined in his house *(our best guess was a humidifier)* and he didn't want to eat the cost. As a courtesy, I offered a reduced repair rate, he accepts.  On his way out, my tech politely wishes him a better afternoon.  Sir stomps back to the counter, grabs the computer, insists he hadn't raised his voice, and stomps out. \n3. Home-bound Sir orders a computer with extended warranty and arranges to have us deliver.  I do so, get it set up with his peripherals, answer questions.  A week later, he calls to swear at me.  He added dates to the computer's calendar app and coincidentally those dates 'disappeared' from the calendar app on his phone.  Of course, it's the computer's fault he can't work the calendar app, and my fault for selling him rubbish.  He is 'spooked' and 'doesn't trust the computer' so he's bringing it back. He also accuses me of adding an unauthorized charge to the receipt. I had him read the line to me, it was the warranty he'd approved. He did apologize for that, thankfully.\n4. Elderly Sir calls to say he cannot access the internet on his tablet at home. I ask if he’s signed into his wifi.  He doesn’t know and insists on coming in.  I explain that his wifi range doesn’t reach our store. OK... he'll come in. I connect his device to our wifi, no hardware issue. He can't tell me which company set up his wifi, doesn’t understand why I can’t fix his router from the store. Looks blankly at me when I ask what his wifi password is, and doesn’t understand why I can’t find his wifi password from the store.  I offer a home visit and let him know the rate.  Pikachu face ensues. That’s WAY too much *(it's really not)*.  He insists that when techs come to help with his television, *they* never charge him.  So since he bought that tablet from us two years ago and since it uses the internet, we are responsible for his internet and should come resolve his issue for free.  Sigh.  I encouraged him to ask his favorite family member to come help him with his router.",

If so you may have a security breach and I will need to alert everyone, change passwords, etc etc...\"\n\n\"No, don't change the password, otherwise I'll need to tell everyone all over again!\"\n\n\"Everyone? You said you are the only person with the password.\"\n\n\"Well OF COURSE my coworker has the password for when I'm out. And my team for the jobs I don't want to do myself. And the CEO because he asked, and how can you say no to the CEO.\"\n\n\"I'll pretend I didn't hear that. Don't put it into an email or I'll be forced to reset your passwords for real. You know that you shouldn't share passwords, right?\"\n\n\"But we all need to work on this and we all need the highest permissions and anyway I trust everyone not to do anything wrong, ever.\"\n\n\"Sure, I guess those files got deleted all on their own?\"\n\n\"It must have been the new employee, they're very stupid, it won't happen again.\"\n\n\"Right. Listen, this is the 24601th time this happened already. How about we make INDIVIDUAL, NAMED accounts for everyone here? I'll even give you all admin privileges, even though I know it's a bad idea, because I know you'll share passwords anyway and at least next time someone breaks something we'll know exactly who it is and we can go frown at them and get them some basic remedial computer training. \"\n\n\"That would be smart, and save us a lot of money and headaches in the long run, so I have to refuse. We will continue with the current system of letting everyone use the administrator account, and I'll call it in a couple of weeks when I fuck up something else. I meant the intern, it was definitely the fault of an intern.\"\n\n\"Sure thing, that'll be 1k and thanks for your contribution to my quarterly bonus.\"\n\n... Fictional conversation, real customer. Instead they just insist they have NO IDEA what's happening and I have to roll with it. Take it from me, consultants are not paid for their expertise, we're paid not to laugh in the customer's face when they lie to us about their shitty security practices.",

        "text": "My wife and I will be moving at some point in the next year or two. Currently we are packing up some stuff in plastic bins. To make the move easier I've elected to label the bins and then keep a list as to what the label means. Bin \"1\" equals children's toys for example.\n\nSo for labels I was just using duct tape on the side and top of the bin, then marking that with a magic marker. After some thought I figured we couldn't possibly get past 1,000 bins, but we might get past 100 bins. So for the first bin I wrote 001 and then went on from there. Makes perfect sense and means I'm planning ahead, right?\n\nThat led to the following conversation with my wife.\n\n**Wife**: Hon, why does this label say \"007\" instead of just \"7?\" Is this a James Bond joke or something?\n\n**Me**: No, the leading zeroes are just in case the database interprets the field as text. If it does, bin number 12 will be sorted before bin 2. With leading zeroes that problem goes away.\n\n**Wife**: Okay fine, your spreadsheet thingee will work better. That I guess I understand, but why do you have to write the zeroes on the tape?\n\n**Me**: Well, because then otherwise when we sort the bins. . . . I suppose you're right that our human brains don't need the zeroes. But I've already labeled 13 bins. I don't want to change our process mid-stream. That is how human error creeps in and we have incidents. Couldn't we keep going?\n\n**Wife**:\n\n**Me**: Fine, I'll stop using the leading zeroes. But I'll also need a little time to relabel the bins I've already done.\n\n**Wife**: Some of those are already loaded into the van. Do you have to relabel them?\n\n**Me**: Well I suppose not. . . . But I would just really feel comfortable if all of them used the same system.  Why don't you relax for about 30 minutes and I'll just take care of them. \n\n**Wife**: I'll have a glass of wine while you handle that.\n\n*Wife leaves the room. I start relabeling.*",

        "text": "Another story from the olden days, pre cell phones, pre internet.\n\nThe company I worked for had gone on a buying spree.  Snapping up a bunch of small POS system vendors who were in financial trouble.  Usually their product wasn't really bad, they had expanded too fast and their management hadn't been able to grow their business without getting into trouble.\n\nAnyway, I was in the support/service division and suddenly we had a bunch of customers to service, along with a bunch of technicians in cities around the country.  Most of the techs were younger guys, used to working on these small storefront type systems.  But we had a bunch much larger customers being serviced by our more professional group of engineers.  \n\nWe had some overlap in cities and there were various headaches with our \"professional\" guys not wanting to deal with the mom-and-pop customers, and the \"new guy\" technicians who were generally keen, but not experienced or trained on the larger more complex systems.  \n\nAt one point one of our old big customers had a problem, which we were able to remotely diagnose down to a particular large peripheral (external disk drive).  The usual engineer was not available so we sent in The New Guy.  He had strict instructions to Not Do Anything unless he was on the phone with our support specialist, who would walk him through replacing the suspected bad part (a large PCB).\n\nNew Guy was very eager to proceed.  We had shipped in a spare part and he was ready to go.  Support guy walked him through disconnecting the cables from the drive so it could slide out on the rails that mounted it to a rack.  Then remove the cover, so many screws on each side, no problem.  Then New Guy removes the suspected bad PCB, installs the new one, and there's an issue.\n\nHe says the cover won't go back on.  The new PCB is too big, it over hangs the unit by a bit.  Support guy can't figure what New Guy is talking about.  Maybe its the wrong part?  New Guy can't find the part number stenciled on the PCB.  This is before cell phones with cameras, we can't see what New Guy sees.  \n\nNew Guy then offers a solution:\n\n\"Hey, the PCB is only a tiny bit too big, I could get my saber saw and just trim a bit off, and then I could get the cover on!\"\n\nSupport Guy, my boss, and me are all on a speaker phone when he comes up with this.  I laugh out loud, pretty good joke.  Support Guy and Boss join in.  We figure we shipped the wrong part, nothing for it but to send him another.\n\nNew Guy hears us laughing:\n\n\"What's so funny?\"\n\nMe\"  \"Yeah, just trim a piece off the PCB.  Sure that will work!\" (with lots of sarcasm).\n\nNew Guy: \"So do you want me to go get my saw or what?\"\n\nAt this point the three of us realize that New Guy **is not joking**.\n\nSupport Guy hastily tells him, NOT to cut anything!  He's got the wrong part.  Its similar to what is needed, but not identical.  Box the \"wrong\" PCB up and send it back, we'll overnight him the correct part.  \n\nWe get off the phone and we're all like WTF.  He really thought he could just cut the PCB down to make it fit, like it was piece of wood trim for his kitchen cabinets or something.  \n\nAfter this we were way more careful about what we asked the various New Guys to do, it wasn't their fault, they had no training or experience on this other equipment.  But seriously, when has a saber saw ever been a standard tool for electronic repair?",

        "text": "Back in the 80s-90s, I was a developer at a company that made Geographic Information System software. This software run on just about every flavour of Unix out there. It consisted of multiple programs that communicated with each other through queues and semaphores. Also, being Unix it was perfectly possible to run multiple copies of the software at the same time. Every now and then the software would crash and you’d have to manually kill all the queues. We had a shell script called “ipcrm” that cleaned up all the resources that belonged to the current user.\n\nNow the sharp eyed readers here would have noticed that “current user” thing. Obviously if there were two people using the software at the same time, you wouldn’t want them to be using the same userid. Not just for the ipcrm reason, but also because if you didn’t use separate userid for each user, there’d be no way to track who had done what.\n\nWhen we set up these systems for a client, we’d send out a tech to help set it up. And the techs had a special account set up so they could do some checking of the setup before the clients started using it. The password on this special account was originally just the first three letters of the month backwards, so in March it would be “ram” and in September it would be “pes”. But the techs didn’t like that, and said it was too confusing, so we made it “*”. (Note: computers weren’t connected to the internet, so this wasn’t as scary as it sounds.) \n\nBut worse than that, the techs told the users about this account, and users being users, they all used it instead of their own accounts. So no auditing, and every time one person’s session died they would run ipcrm and it would kill everybody else’s session as well.",

        "text": "I recently ran into an old work colleague and he asked during our conversation, “hey, do you remember getting called into the principal’s office (Director of IT) over TimJim’s (not the real user name) rating?”\n\nLong one, but I think it needs the groundwork laid. This happened some time ago.\n\nWe had temp agency people come in during a big hardware or OS upgrade. Novell to PassGo, Windows 2000 to Windows XP – Dell to HP back to Dell and then to Lenovo, etc.\n\n**Relevant note**: There was a time when many/most of our remote users had admin rights so that they could more easily deal with printer drivers, USB drives and stuff like that. This, surprisingly lasted about 4 years, until they pulled the plug with the upgrade to Windows 7.\n\nWe had a lot of homegrown department-specific applications that interfaced with the mainframe in whatever way required for that department to access their portion of the business. Some of it required hands-on configuration.\n\nWe had an OS &amp; Applications image for each of the main departments. Some of those builds were install &amp; go. Others had the base applications installed, but they couldn’t figure out a way to package some of the configurations, so they became hands-on deployments.\n\nTo be fair, there was some validity to the fact that users dreaded any of these big changes. Some percentage of people always had issues post-upgrade. The temps would build and deploy the computers during the evening and us full time would deal with any issues the next morning.\n\nProbably due to the fact that people hated these upgrades, management instituted a 5-star rating system for the deployments to try and figure out what was going on. The full-time techs were responsible for making sure that every deployed person responded to the rating sheet on the general portal. (The results from that were sent to a couple people tasked with collecting the data.)\n\nThings went well for me in general. I’d been there for years and was rarely surprised or stumped by anything that came up in that corporate environment. What DID surprise me and my manager was the 1-star rating that came in from TimJim, complaining that important files were missing.\n\n1-star was obviously abysmal and cause for great concern. I think we’d never seen anything less than 2 and that was super rare.\n\nMy manager and I were told to show up at the IT director’s office at a certain time and we’d call the remote user to see what happened…\n\nWe were in the director’s office on a Polycom. He called the remote person at the specified time. After some general “how ya doin’” nonsense, he got down to it:\n\n**Director**: Tech (me), manager (mine) and manager (his) are here in the office with me. I see that you’re having problems with important files missing. Can you tell me what application or process is affected by that, or is it missing documents that you’ve created?\n\n**Remote**: (With no hesitation or shame, or whatever): I let my son use the laptop when I’m not working. He plays Battlefield 1942, which saves his progress. When I got this new laptop and reinstalled the game, none of those files were there so he had to start all over again.\n\nI looked at my manager, who I’ve said before was THE best that you could ever want. He stood up, spread out his arms like Jesus addressing the masses, shook his head and motioned for me to follow him out.\n\nSome time later the remote guy’s manager told my manager how sorry he was for all of the trouble and the rating. That he had assumed it was just a bad deployment. The director told my manager to connect remotely to the user’s laptop, check it for anything that shouldn’t be there and to remove admin rights.",

        "text": "Another old guy story, apologies for length.\n\nLong, long ago, I was a junior manager in a tech support/service organization for a mid sized computer company.  We were going through a rapid expansion and our service techs were getting busier and busier.  We had no automated call tracking or parts usage system and it was getting more and more difficult to keep track of everything.  So the various managers got together and decided to ask corporate for permission to purchase a software suite that one of them was familiar with.  None them really knew how programming such a system would work, they were mostly older guys who came out of the old \"hardware is hardware, software is software, and the two don't mix\", environment.\n\nThe vendor for the chosen product was a small company in the area I was based in so a demo was scheduled while all the managers were in town for a meeting.  The owner of the company showed with a portable PC (remember those \"luggable\" computers, looked kind of like a sewing machine in its case?).  So we all gathered around the tiny CRT display built into the PC and the guy demoed his product.\n\nThe vendor had started the product as a cheap system for appliance repair businesses, but it could be adapted easily for computers and peripherals.  It would do everything we needed it to do.  Each piece of customer equipment would be tagged with a unique \"asset number\" by our field techs, who would forward this info to their regional office.  Each office would hire a dispatcher/receptionist person who would enter all the information.  Each customer could have multiple locations, with a default tech assigned, each location would have a list of all installed equipment, it was going to be great.  \n\nIt took months to get all the data collected and entered, plus our spare parts database had to be created.  We had a large variety of peripherals, each with a separate set of spare parts, plus multiple spare parts locations, so this took a long time as well.\n\nFinally we were ready to go live!  Each office had an IBM XT clone with a 4 way serial card since the OS we were using supported multiple users, so our parts clerks could have a terminal in their stockroom while the PC with the console was at the dispatcher's desk.  The PCs had their standard 5.25 inch floppy drives, which we were to backup each system daily.  (You can imagine how that worked out).\n\nAnd things fell apart from day one.  The \"systems\" were so slow it was not possible enter a service call in real time.  Went something like this:\n\nCustomer calls and says they have a problem to report.\n\nDispatcher switches to the correct menu for entering a call.\n\n(It could take 2-3 seconds to change from one menu to another and there were no short cuts, dispatcher had to exit to the top level, then drill down.)\n\nDispatcher would ask customer for asset number, customer would provide number, dispatcher would enter number.  The systems were so slow that the dispatcher would finish typing in the number before anything displayed on the screen.  If the dispatcher had hit \"enter\" to do the lookup, and there was typo, they system would grind for 10-15 seconds before returning an error.  So the dispatchers got in the habit of entering the numbers, waiting for 10 seconds for the display to refresh, then moving to the next screeen.  Entering the reported problem had the same screen delay issue.  Creating a single service call would take over 3 minutes since each look up or menu change had this 10-15 second delay.  \n\nUsually customers would not call in until they had 4 or 5 calls to open (unless it was an emergency) since they knew they'd be on the phone for a while.  Meanwhile, the dispatcher was getting other calls and having to tell other customers that they'd call them back.  Needless to say customers were ticked off since we had bragged about this system, and now they were on the phone for ages waiting, or being told to call back, or please provide a call back number.  The dispatchers were really frazzled since everyone was getting shirty with them over the amount of time things took.  Our techs were bugged also since they couldn't close a call over the phone since the dispatchers were backed up.\n\nThen entire deal was clearly unworkable.  Dispatchers had to take down service requests *on paper!*  Enter the information offline, call customers back with the call numbers, page the techs to dispatch the calls, sometimes having to have the tech wait on hold while dealt with a customer.  A while bunch of people were wasting a lot of time since we introduced our \"automated\" system.\n\nA bunch of discussion went on above my pay grade, but our corporate MIS team got roped into investigating things.  These guys had experience with the OS we were using since they supported the companies manufacturing system and it ran on the same OS.  They got a copy of the source code from the vendor, who probably had never sold his product to an outfit our size.  Our MIS guys said to pick someone from the service organization to interface with them and they'd fix it if they could.\n\nI got picked to be the \"project manager\" and flew out to the head office to meet with the MIS guys.\n\nFirst off, I got an earful about how the parts tracking system was completely unworkable.  It had no audit function at all.  Parts could be changed from one location to another without any kind of logged transaction.  There was also a \"feature\" than if a parts clerk was looking up an item, and found the quantity available was incorrect, he could use a hot key to drop into a database editor and just change the quantity on the fly.  So the MIS guys basically said they were going to have to re-write a ton of code to make this package comply with basic standards.\n\nThe field service folks were okay with this, no one really understood or cared about the inventory side of the issue, it was the speed issue that was killing us.  The MIS manager just hand waved this issue, it was a hardware problem.  They couldn't re-write the code to make it faster, we had to buy better, faster PCs.  He gave me the contact info for a consult/integrator for the OS we were using in my home location and just said to call them.  \n\nIt turned out he was correct.  I met with the consultant, they put together a 386 based system with a fancy disk controller for us to test.  I spent a day with them installing a copy of our code and databases and did a side-by-side comparison.   The speed was greatly improved and we now had a solution.   We were up against a classic \"sunk cost\" issue.  We had invested a bunch of money in the code, plus hundreds of hours entering customer data, no one wanted to walk away from that.  So we begged the gods of corporate finance and they allowed us to purchase a total of 5 (I think) systems.  The MIS guys bought an additional system for themselves since had to write and proof all the stuff we were asking them to do.  \n\nThere were a bunch of other tweaks we had to implement to make the system usable but at least we had something that didn't drive people insane. \n\nI learned a very valuable lesson from the entire experience.   No one had actually sat down and written out actual specifications for what we needed.  It was \"we used this product in my last job, and it kind of worked, so let's buy that\".  \n\nAnd don't cheap out on the hardware!",

For some reason, in some pc's (this was a Dell Optiplex) getting people logged into their Enterprise account is a MAJOR chore - and this one was one of those.   \nI kept getting the \"we cannot reach the server\" message no matter what I did when trying to get him logged in.

UGGG.   \nThis pc did not possess the app reset tool which clears out all credentials and clears the office cache so I couldn't use that.   \nTime to dive into the registry because this damn thing just wouldn't cooperate but now I'm on a mission from god.

        "text": "This one came through work in the last few days.  We have a team that makes complicated excel workbooks for other teams to use when updating our customers records. Recently 2 people started complaining that could not click the embedded radio buttons on one of the worksheets.  Many other people have no issues with this workbook, and the app teams couldn't duplicate the issue either. So off to my team it came.\n\nFirst user i worked with, we just closed everything, restarted and buttons started working again. Magic, I've no idea what we did, but i tend to not question my awesomeness.\n\nCouple days go by and i'm told a second user is now having problems. I remote into their system, always fun in a multi monitor setup, try the same troubleshooting with them, but this time doesn't work.\n\nI open the file locally on my computer, buttons work fine. I confirm they have all office updates installed, they're open a version from server, not an old local copy. it all looks good.\n\nThen i remember, so programs are very dependent on the settings of the \"main screen\". I decide to re-open the workbook on the main screen, and the buttons work. Back to non main screen, buttons don't work. Set main screen to second monitor, open workbook on second monitor, buttons still work.\n\nSo apparently radio buttons from old excel files in new office are finicky.  I wonder if this is a bug or feature...\n\nOne of the many cases that really highlights where experience over school comes in handy, cause this definitely isn't on any certification I'm aware of.",

        "text": "You wouldn't think it would be needed in this day and age, but alas, when you think you've made something idiot proof, the world creates a better idiot.\n\nBackstory:\n\nBack in the day I worked for a giant manufacturing company that I can guarantee everybody has heard of. As with most manufacturing companies, a lot of the dull work was automated and controlled by what are called PLCs. Think of them as small computers that control something, like a conveyor belt, or a valve.\n\nUnlike computers however, these things needed to be programmed to do whatever it is that they do. Part of this programming is creating a user interface with buttons and such that do the things you want it to do: press a button to open a valve, press another button to stop production, etc.\n\nThe story:\nAs a general IT guy, I had to work on everything imaginable. One day I get a call saying that a site's PLC will not open a valve to dispense grain to a train car. Normally not a problem, but the site is:\n1. Out in the middle of nowhere\n2. Nobody on site is technically inclined; the nearest IT person of a sort was an electrician that knew how to turn on computers about an hour away.\n3. This had been an issue for over a day and late fees on the train cars had been piling up, as they are having to manually open the valve and calculate the weight of the grain by hand.\n\nSo no bueno. They have already restarted everything and brought in the electrician (at a good bit of $$$) to help look at it. I decide to bring in our PLC guy, and this is where it gets interesting.\n\nWhen you press a button, what happens is that it sends a data bit over to the PLC. The PLC goes, hey, I got this data bit, what do I do now? And looks it up in the programming, then does whatever it is suppose to do. In this case, open a valve, monitor the amount dispensed, then close it.\n\nHOWEVER, whomst ever coded this app set it up in such a way that you needed to press the button AND also let go of the button without moving the mouse for everything to work correctly.\n\nGuess what didn't happen? Guess what took us hours to figure out?\n\nExactly that.",

It's one of his favorite stories from tech support.\n\nHe once got called over to a customer to fix a computer not booting so he went over to check what was going on. The computer was seemingly turning on and the fans would start spinning but the screen stayed black and there were no beeps no bios, no nothing.He started troubleshooting, trying everything: cleaning, replacing ram, cmos reset, blood sacrifice, all the basic troubleshooting steps that you can think off. Yet, nothing would work and he just couldn't figure out why. One basic step in troubleshooting this kind of problem is to unplug the computer and hold down the power button for about 10-20 seconds to drain the power. However, when unplugged the computer and pressed the power button, the impossible happend: The computer turned on, same as before, screen black, fans spinning, no beeps. My boss was flabberghasted, what the hell was going on? Had he just found the key to all our energy problems? Was the blood-sacrifice not big enough? He just couldn't wrap his head around the fact that the computer was drawing power with an unplugged power supply.\n\nHow did the Computer draw power you ask? Well, turns out that he had not unplugged all USB devices yet. He had unplugged almost everything but the mouse, keyboard and an USB hub. It turned out that the USB hub had it's own power supply and was feeding power through the USB port to the computer, but only to the fans and nothing else. Once the USB Hub was unplugged the machine started booting normally again. To this day he has no idea how that's even possible technically.\n\nThank you for reading, may your day be blessed with agreeable  customers.",

        "text": "More tales from the trenches.\n\nThis one dates from my time in Malaysia in the late ‘90’s.\n\nWe were setting up a “Centre of Excellence” and as part of this we were to be receiving the first “in country” example of new server family from the parent company.\n\nNow during this time period KLIA Cargo, maaf saya, KLIA Kargo, had some serious form on breaking stuff.\n\nOur manufacturing arm loved us as each time a customer in Malaysia bought something there was a very good chance that it would be a 2 for 1 deal: One “sold” to the insurer as a write off, and one sold to the actual customer.\n\nThere’s not a lot you can do with a late ‘90’s 50GB RAID unit after someone has dropped it 20 feet onto the airport tarmac after all but scrap it.\n\nAnyhow, so our eagerly awaited server, really two rack mount servers with dedicated RAID and power mounted back to back in a single cabinet (there were reasons, honest), had arrived at KLIA and we were informed that there may have been “issues” with the handling.\n\nAnyhow, we contacted a company that was supposedly a specialist in handling fragile IT type stuff, told them the details of our goods inwards: No high level offload available so you need a truck with a tail lift. No pallet truck available, you need to bring one.\nA few hours later we get the call that they will be there in ten minutes and we head down to the loading bay of our office building.\n\nThe “specialist movers” duly arrive.\n\nIn a standard 3 ton truck with a side door and not even a ramp, let alone a tail lift, with only the driver and his mate on board.\n\nThey pull up the side door of the truck to reveal the delivery, which sits on a standard pallet, and is about 6’6” (2m) high with a 3’3” (1m) by 5’ (1.5m) footprint and a weight of getting on for 600lbs (300Kg), and look at us expectantly.\n\nA somewhat animated discussion ensued, followed by a heated mobile phone conversation between my boss and the supposed shipping company. As a result of which we were told to wait for some specialist equipment to be sent to facilitate offloading and delivery.\n\nAbout and hour later the “specialist equipment” arrived which turned out to be half a dozen hefty blokes loaded into the back of a pickup truck.\n\nBy this time we had made a cursory inspection of the shipment and it didn’t look good. All of the “tell tales” attached to it had triggered, indicating that the thing had been bounced around and tipped beyond the shipping and handling specifications, and worse than that the packaging itself showed impact damage. So, knowing that whatever happened from this point onwards was pretty much academic, we settled back to watch the show as these lads tried to figure out how they were going to get this very heavy, very bulky and very fragile object down off the back of the truck and into the building.\n\nSo, they looked around the loading bay to see what was available and found the following: one 12’ scaffolding pole, and one 10’ length of 6”x4” wood. These they proceeded to prop against the truck door as a makeshift ramp.\n\nAt this point my two colleagues and I realised what they were about to attempt and wished that we had a camera to hand.\n\nThey manhandled the server across the truck bed and by dint of rocking it backwards managed to get it onto the top of their makeshift “ramp”. They then proceeded to edge it out of the truck door and down the ramp. The 6x4 piece of wood proceeded to bend and creak alarmingly under the load, but by some miracle they managed to get the thing down to ground level without anybody being killed or even seriously injured.\n\nSo what next? As mentioned, they had omitted to bring the much needed pallet truck, and there was no way they were carrying this thing to the goods lift.\n\nOne of the guys went off and borrowed a couple of trolleys from somewhere.\n\nThese were the sort of things that the mail room might use to move small packages weighting s few tens of pounds around. Not the bast part of a half ton of computer, but in for a penny…\n\nAgain by brute force and a lot of tipping they somehow managed to get the thing up and precariously balanced up on these two hopelessly inadequate conveyances, and proceeded to haul the thing in the direction of the goods lift.\n\nThis didn’t go a smoothly as they hoped, as some of the trolley’s wheel bearings gave up their struggle against the laws of physics about half way there, with the result that black streaks of melted plastic from the wheels were left across across the faux marble of the floor as a remembrance of their passage.\n\nOnce we got up to our floor the process was repeated in reverse, with more black plastic witness marks left to puzzle the cleaners.\n\nThen we had to decide what to do with the obviously damaged equipment. Because it was a first installation of a new range of equipment int he country we had a couple of commissioning engineers who had been flow in especially to install the thing, and they had nothing better to do, so they got on the phone to the factory to find out how best to proceed, once they had removed the shipping packaging and assessed the damage: Casing broken. Internal 19” racks distorted. Various mounting bolts sheared. All in all and absolute wreck.\n\nThey vary carefully powered it up, testing for electrical safety at each stage.\n\nIt bloody well worked.\n\nStill had to be scrapped though.\n\nThe replacement was delivered without incident. Which was a pity, because this time I remembered to bring my camera.",

        "text": "So, I am sitting as tech support trying to help one of my colleagues remotely.\n\nThe issue today is: Unable to connect with remote connection.\n\nSolution: Add authenticator to account.\n\nBackground: All users have access to a remote desktop system which they can login from anywhere they are, but it requires an authenticator phone app for it to work. Me as an administrative IT guy, I can use remote control software that can easily be given out with a link the remotely helps people which then lets me connect to their computers. Also on this particular day, voice communications were not possible.\n\nSo, I got an e-mail message that complained about not being able to connect to our remote desktop server, so the first thing I did was send them a link to let me connect to their computer, something that is pretty standard.\n\nAs expected, it was exactly the problem I thought it was. The reason why they have to do it while I watch is due to two possibilities, either authenticator is not setup correctly or there is a missing registry key, this time it was the authenticator.\n\nI then tell him to go to a certain website and log in, just to re-activate the authenticator.\n\nThey managed to login to that website with SMS as the MFA choice the first time within like 2 minutes with no help from me, but then we started with the authenticator setup.\n\nDue to how the app is made, you are unable to take screenshots as long as it is open on the phone screen, so I have been unable to make a picture by picture tutorial on how to set it up.\n\nI then take over the computer for a minute to start the setup process, then I message him to follow the instructions shown on the screen. And he freaking closes the setup dialogue box and refreshes the page and breaks it…\n\nhe then proceeds open up multiple remote connections to try and connect to the server… I had to send an message with the highest priority possible to make him stop that spam, then proceed to explain to him we have not fixed anything, and the remote connection can only be established when the authenticator is working due to security reasons… freaking 10 minutes it took, had to do it while I was watching him try multiple times too. Pretty sure he was going to get locked out pretty soon if he did not stop.\n\nI managed to take over the computer and go back to the website to re-register the authenticator and message him to login again. Username, password, authenticator… timeout, and now he just sits there for like 2 minutes doing nothing…\n\nI then decided to message him to start the login process over again then use SMS as the verification method next time. So, he starts over again, username, password, authenticator… timeout.\n\nI then messaged them again to retry the login again, and told them to not click on anything with authenticator as a choice, but with SMS as a choice instead. So for the 3rd time, we go through the steps again.\n\nUsername, password, authenticator code… wtf, that is wrong. I then message him to click on the &lt; button on the top of the white box, he refreshes the page instead… I then wonder how he never got any problems before now…\n\nSo, we go thru the process again, password, username, authenticator… I even told him to not choose authenticator OR authenticator codes, but SMS… the worst part is, I have full keyboard/mouse access to he’s computer ever since he ran the software, but he never stopped moving the mouse, so I was never able to take over the computer to click on the correct choices. I even tried drawing on the screen to highlight the SMS selection.\n\nThe software does have the choice block user inputs, but requires it to be installed, which we are not supposed to do on a worker’s personal computer, also requires admin rights to install too, which he does not have.\n\nSo, after like five tries, he finally clicks on the SMS selection, and does nothing. I sent him a message, and he never read it… I even wrote on the screen to check he’s SMS’s on the phone and nothing… after like 6 minutes of trying to contact him, he finally enters the code…but its timed out…\n\nThen I got the idea to enlist the one person that is near him right now to help with this issue, and it worked wonders! Finally got back into the website to re-register the authenticator, finally gotten to the part where they are able to scan the QR code, but the phone app…\n\nThey told me that it requires a username and password to unlock, and they did not know the password at all… and this point, we have used like 2 hours just to get back into the site the second time… and most of the time was used by him staring at the screen and not reading my messages.\n\nSo, I tried to get an confirmation to reset the password…left on sent…then 10 minutes later I got the message that they needed to go to an meeting…",

Where have you bene half of my working life?), and by about 11AM I had patched all of the low hanging fruit and it was time to run the integrity checker again. I hit the \"Enter\" key on the console and the IT Manager lookedover and said \"As that will run for a bit do you fancyt a brew?'  \n\n\nNow then \"A Brew\" in most parts of the UK refers to tea, so I said \"Yes\".  \n\n\n\"Follow me\" says that worthy and leads me off through the offices, up a couple of floors to a somewhat spartan room with hard back chairs arrayed around the wall, and a large open cupboard containing a racked-up &amp; tapped beer barrel, and many many pint glasses:  \n\n\n\"We get unlimited beer but no spirits as we are classed as clerical, the guys on the shop floor get three pints a day and the executives get access to a full wet bar\" says the aforementioned worthy as he pured me a pint of their best.  \n\n\nThe security lodge had hand-pumps where the workers got their beer on the morning, lunch, and afternoon breaks, displensed by the security guards.  \n\n\nYou don't want people to be too pissed when they are driving fork lift trucks after all.  \n\n\nThe week went past in a blur.  \n\n\nI remember the IT Manager calling his wife at about 4pm most days to get picked up from the train because he would be too drunk to drive by 7pm. To be honest, I don't know how often his car left the car park.  \n\n\nAt one point we had reached the stage where there were certain data records that simply couldn't be patched back into the correct structures, so we had to figure out whether ot was worth the effort of even noting their contents before we simply deleted them. Hence \"Crate of empty Guinness bottles\" entered my personal lexicon as the upper bound of \"Worthless\"  \n\n\nThat particular crate may still sitting in a  Pub Cellar to this day...",

        "text": "As I have said I. Precious posts, Back in the ‘80’s I was a member of the worldwide support team for a mainframe DBMS. As I was the only member who was a childless twenty something I was the one who tended to have to haul ass to customer sites when things got critical.\n\nAs anyone who has done this sort of work will tell you, this is not as fun as it sounds:\n\n“So how was the South of France at the weekend?”\n\n“Marseille airport is a dump. The customer site was on an industrial estate in the middle of nowhere and when I finally got to the motel at 3am I discovered that my camera had been stolen”\n\nWas a typical exchange.\n\nSo we had this one customer in Hong Kong that due to the specifics of their application seemed to manage to hit every bug harder and faster than everyone else, and because it was a critical system to the point where if there was down time of more than a few minutes the knock on effects tended to make the evening news, when they went down the company paid attention.\n\nOne Wednesday at about 4PM the phone rang. It was Hong Kong and something had gone horribly wrong. One of their key application components just plain wouldn’t run and they needed me there immediately to get it fixed. Well the symptoms of the failure they were getting were a perfect match for a known problem caused by a fault in a run time library belonging to the ID, but they insisted that they were patched up to date and that this must be a new problem.\n\nPressure was applied up and down the line and I was duly dispatched on a big paraffin budgie towards the fragrant harbour that following Saturday.\n\nWhen I landed at Kai Tak on Sunday morning I was surprised to be met by an old friend and colleague who had been dragged in from Melbourne on the Friday to provide cover, and who greeted me thus :\n\n“You were right. They had applied that fix but not in the environment they were running the production job. I figure we fixed it about the same time your plane took off. Shall we go to the Pub?”\n\nFatal mistake. After a few Sunday lunchtime pints I got into my hotel and crashed far too early and subsequently had the worst jet lag of my life until my return flight the following weekend.\n\nAt least that trip only lasted a week. The previous time I had been hauled out there to help diagnose and fix a problem that was blocking the acceptance test for the entire project. I was supposed to be there for a week and packed accordingly. I fixed the problem, or rather the dev team back home did while I did all the evidence collection and initial analysis, but the big suit as decided that I should stay until sign off in case anything else broke. The net result being that I was there for nearly a month in total, the last two weeks of which I was simply wandering around Hong Kong carrying a pager, and my rangy arsed collection of clothing went through the hotel laundry a number of times sufficient to generate bills that would have paid for me to replace the lot a couple of times over.\n\nThe expense claim at the end of that one was legendary.",

        "text": "Hi.  A tale of personal bug hunting this time, lovingly copied from pcmr, where I first shared it. I built a £740 ruthless minmax build a week or so back. I'm having a great time with it, but it seems that in my quest to pinch pennies, I have flown too close to the sun. Let me relate to you my tale, so as that you may laugh at me, and perhaps learn from my mistake.\n\nMy specs, for reference:\n\nRyzen 3 3100, cheap micro ATX B450 board, 240gb ssd, one singular 8gb stick of ram, RX6900XT, 8 year old case.\n\nOne of these things is not like the others.\n\nInitially, I'd been trying to get a set of G.Skill ram to run in my system for first boot, but that RAM was being flaky, so I stole a stick from my spreadsheet muncher and booted with that. That is the config I posted, and it's the last time my system was stable. Initially, I played some Warzone at 1080p, just to see what kind of CPU choking situation I was in, and when I saw I was getting 45-75 fps, I pretty quickly decided that the RAM needed to go. I then tried Deathloop at 4K with the ray tracing on, and... yeah, that shit was ROUGH. It's evident that short of Cyberpunk, nothing I can do is going to stress the GPU. That RAM has to go.\n\nSo, I try again with the G.Skill, and this time, I manage to get it to boot. I try Warzone again, and at 1080p, I'm now getting up to 130fps. I then crank the settings all the way up to extreme and set the resolution to 4K, knowing that Warzone has an unhealthy love for dat AMD booty, and that I'm going to bounce off that CPU limit at 4K. I IMMEDIATELY whole-system crash. Figuring that there's something up with 'zone, I try again, and Warzone just ain't having any of that. 'Zone is borked, I think to myself, and move on. It's probably a rogue setting that I have to hunt down later or a bios update I need to do. I move on to Deathloop, though, and this is where it gets nasty. The moment I go out onto the generator area, I crash, and these crashes are nasty. Lockups, whole system crashes, big scary error codes, it's nasty. Deathloop ain't having any of it, either.\n\nSo, at this point, I chalk it up to a problem with my RAM. After all, the G.Skill ram was being flaky earlier, and lo and behold, when I put it in my Excel beast, it fails to boot. I try the full kit of known-good ram from the boring computer in my shiny new gaming monster, and it runs fine... right up until it doesn't. Warzone is still broken, Deathloop is still refusing to even open, and, after a day or so, I get a random hard crash on Evil West.\n\nOnce is coincidence, twice is happenstance, three times is enemy action. Something is getting ripped out of my computer tonight.\n\nBut what to pin the blame on? The ssd is cheap, but it's in immaculate condition? The PSU? nah, I overspeced by 100 watts, and a PSU failure is usually a lot more... permanent. Bad GPU? Nah, I've redlined enough cards to know what 94 degrees on the GPU sounds like, this ain't it, chief. Bad board? Unlikely. Ram? Already cleared. CPU? Nah, this thing basically doesn't have the capacity to kill itself. I'm scratching my head. Why the hell was this thing stable when it was being choked before, but it's messing me around now?\n\nThen I have a moment of clarity. The guy I got it from on ebay says that MSI recommends an 800 watt power supply, but I assumed that was because they expected me to pair this with a 13900k and a crazy watercooler. I check my total power consumption, and it's theoretically about 530 watts, then I check BeQuiet's PSU calculator and... lo and behold, they don't recommend anything less than 750 watts, due to... brief power loads.\n\nOh. Oh shit, I forgot about transients. I try running all my games at 1080p to put the load back on the CPU, and all of a sudden I'm stable again. Fuck.\n\nIn my haste to get this rig running at any cost, I'd throttled my system with that one stick of RAM to the point that even at 4K, my graphics card was just sitting around twiddling its thumbs, waiting for frames to render, meaning that it couldn't ever reach the kind of load that would cause an OCP crash. But now, with the massive power of a Ryzen 3 3100 fully unleashed, I have just given my GPU CARTE FUCKING BLANCHE to write out cheques that my power supply cannot possibly hope to cash. My entire system was teetering on the brink, held back only by grossly inadequate RAM.\n\nSo, the message here? Transients are a bitch, if you're getting random crashes, try kneecapping your GPU, and stop looking at CPU and motherboard upgrades as a solution to every problem. It's your fucking power supply. It's always the fucking power supply.",

        "text": "A long time ago, when IT support was a mix of procedures, processes and a wild-west of system implementations, a user called the helpdesk while in one of our smallest offices (think 2 desks) and asked for me in particular. \n\nI thought this odd as I'd not dealt with them personally before - but any level of 'odd' on helpdesk would be outdone by the next call anyway, so I didn't raise any red flags back then. Bless my innocence. \n\nThe user explained that they'd submitted a ticket for this issue, but as it was month-end, they needed a bit more urgency. \n\nThey can't print. Can't print from their laptop, can't print from the PC in the office. They need to print one of the reports along with an invoice to a customer. It's urgent. \n\nI run through a few basics, like checking they are printing to the correct printer, etc. And whilst checking my notes, remember that this office is one of the few with a print server still to be decommissioned. \n\nI couldn't ping the printer. \n\nIs it switched on? Blah blah. \n\n&gt;Yes, yes, all working.\n\nI'll have a poke around the server as it also has a domain controller and a few other services that might need checking anyway (no central management, etc. back then). \n\nI couldn't log into it, no response on RDP. \n\nI couldn't ping it. \n\nI couldn't ping the office router. \n\nI ask the user;\n\n&gt;Are you able to access the internet? \n\n&gt;Yes, no issues with that.\n\nOk, strange. Check the VPN server at head office, no connection attempts from that office for a while. Very strange. \n\nI ask if the user can find the mini rack in the corner of the office space to check the router lights through the glass door. \n\nThey respond that they are all green. Weird, that particular router should have at least one red/orange one. Maybe they were looking at the server or the firewall appliance. \n\nNo, they described the router as I'd expect. \n\nI asked if they could check the lights on the server. \n\n&gt;Erm, let me call you back, just getting another call from a customer... \nClick.\n\nI continue troubleshooting all I could think of, checking last access logs, etc. Nothing was showing any usage for a while, around 3 weeks. \n\nI escalate to my manager as I'll need authorisation to drive the ~600 mile round trip to check in person as nothing is responding remotely and the ISP is reporting no outages, etc. \n\nI had to call the user back to perform a few more checks before being allowed to make the journey, but they were quite abrupt with their answers. Something wasn't right but I put it down to their issues causing knock-on effects on customer relations during a contract renewal, etc. but manage to set a date and time to visit the user at the office in a few days. \n\nI get the authorisation through, book the travel (policy dictated I had to book a hotel if over a certain driving distance) and set off on the drive. \n\nArriving at the office, the user wasn't there. I went to the building reception and went through their security processes, sign in, etc. and get a visitor badge. \n\nScanning the badge on the door, green light, door clicks. I push it open and switch on the light...\n\nWhere are the desks? \n\nWhere are the PCs and monitors?\n\nWhere is the network cabinet? \n\nWhere are the servers? \n\nI call down to reception to check I had the right office. \n\nI call my boss to check I had the right office. I did. Explaining the situation, my boss alerts the user's manager. They pass my boss onto HR...\n\nIt turns out that someone in finance had caught wind of a strange situation with the user's fuel card and opened an investigation. \n\nThe user was filling up with more fuel than their company car could hold (i.e. their fuel tank was 60 litres, but they were claiming 120 - 150 litres a time and *frequently*) and they were found to be filling up their car, their partner's car as well as their daughter's car. Naughty. \n\nSo, dear reader, how does this relate to the user's issue with printing? \n\nWell, as part of the fraud investigations, I was asked for an inventory of the IT stuff at the office. \n\nThis is because the user had been found to have eBayed basically the entire office - fixtures, fittings, IT equipment, the lot - except for the printer. \n\nThe user had thought they could have connected to it directly over the network (just like our more modern printer/fax/copiers) and didn't realise this one still had a print server setup. Not to mention that they'd sold the router that created the network as well, so didn't even get that far and called us. \n\nThey asked for me as they knew I'd not dealt with them before and could play dumb with any questions.",

        "text": "Way back in pre-history, Before the Internet and almost before email.\n\nThat dark time we call The 1980’s.\n\nI was in the 3rd line support team for a Database Management System that ran on Mainframes.\n\nWe had maybe 1000 sites worldwide running on this software, and a support structure that looked like this:\n\n1st line: Depending on territory this was some sort of helldesk that dealt with the company’s entire portfolio. If you were lucky they recognised the DBMS name and realised that it was actually one of ours and would at least pass the call on to the right part of…\n\n2nd line: Locally based techs who primarily dealt with the Mainframe OS and installation of upgrades &amp; maintenance releases. As far as the DBMS I worked with, well if we were lucky they had someone around who could spell it.\n\n3rd line: my happy crew. A split team. On site was me who tended to handle fronting the unit to the rest of the company and customers, along with the rest of the unit who were home based colleagues. A total of maybe 10 of us, plus a couple of guys whose job it was to run the regression suite for maintenance releases and recommended base patch levels.\n\nYes. We had home workers even way back then. They used to have to dial in to use the Mainframe and their phone bills were also telephone numbers. \n\nWe were responsible for diagnosing and fixing the software. Fixes being in the form of actual patches. Not wholesale releases of software libraries, actual pieces of assembler-like source code which, by use of a utility specifically developed for this purpose, would be inserted as code snippets into the software libraries on disk.\n\nBelieve me, this was a step up from the previous generation, within which you had to write your patches in assembly language, then hand compile the instructions into their Octal equivalent (24 bit machine) along with place holders and directions as to how to calculate memory addresses &amp;etc. We also sometimes had to send these fixes out by Fax. yes. Fax. The scope for transcription errors was hilarious.\n\nAnyhow. I was talking about the Neolithic, not the Palaeolithic, so…\n\nIf there was something that we couldn’t fix in 3rd Line then it went to the dev team. This only happened if the world was on fire.\n\nThe world was quite often on fire. At one point a particularly understanding customer set in a birthday card for their bug report. \n\nSo one day there was even more of an apocalypse ongoing than usual. \n\nI was about to jump on a plane to go to Hong Kong or somewhere to try to put out a fire, the dev team was up to their eyeballs in backlog and everyone else had at least one “Count the c-suite who are on copy to figure out which on to look at first” bug report on their desks, when “Lo!”: Something else went titsup. We were at the point where problems were being categorised based on “life, limb, and legal”, and the latest one, even though the account manager was going apoplectic, didn’t hit any of those buttons. \n\nSo we did the only thing we could. We told him to go away and stop bothering the adults thus: “We understand the urgency of your issue and so we have passed it to our validation unit for investigation and reproduction of the circumstances of the fault”.\n\nThey seemed happy, oblivious as they were to the fact that all the validation team could do was push the evidence boxes into a corner and prod them with a stick…\n\nEvidence boxes? Oh yes. The only way we could collect any logs, application source code or similar artefacts that might help diagnose a problem was by getting it printed off, usually on fan fold, and shipped to us. Sometimes from the other side of the planet.\n\n“Why not do it electronically?” I hear you ask.\n\nWell I did try once in about 1984. We had one system that used to be able to format system memory dumps (stop sniggering at the back there) onto disk and as that system was equipped with a couple of floppy drives (The 9” ones) and the machine had at most 3MB of RAM, these could be sent in rather than 5-10 boxes of fan fold paper.\n\nSo a system on another continent was crashing twice a day and causing some consternation, and it was going to take 24 hours to get someone onto a plane to carry the evidence back up to us. A thought struck me: We had a Worldwide X.25 communications network across which file could be transferred point to point between directly connected machines. It would be possible to get that evidence to us with only two intermediate hops. Surely that would be quicker than a meatsuit sitting on a Jumbo?\n\nNo. no it wasn’t. Even for less than 2MB of data it took well over 18 hours to get that file to the local machine for analysis. It was only an 8 hour flight.\n\nIt could have been worse. It could have been the time a customer sent us in a copy of their DB Schema in the form of a stack of punch cards. If only we had had a reader…",

        "text": "Not sure if this belongs here as my communication with the client is relatively sparse, even though I'm still helping someone with a tech problem. Here goes!\n\nA few times, I offered a desktop computer repair service as a side gig. The computer I was tasked with working on, was one of those miniature desktops that's about the size of an optical disk drive, except a bit wider. A nice cheap machine for basic tasks. The issue was that it wouldn't turn on, and the owners suspected a power supply issue. On these, it's a laptop-style power \"brick\" on the outside, rather than an internal PSU that towers have. Easily replaceable. \n\nNow, normally I could build a dummy load and test the power supply. However, the client already cut open the brick, cut too deep and gouged several traces on the circuit board in the process. (In his defense I probably would have tried the same thing on my own device, even if it were more of a post mortem. Most external power supply \"bricks\" or \"wall warts\" are near-impossible to open without destroying them, or should i say \"bricking\" them, pun intended)\n\nHowever, they still had the back cover of the brick, and the leads going to the barrel plug that powers the computer, were color coded. Great! That means I knew the voltage needed, the polarity and the model of the brick. Thank you for saving those!\n\nI had a bench power supply that was adjustable. This wouldn't have helped much for a tower computer which required multiple different voltages, but it was fine for this, which just had the one pair of wires leading to the barrel plug. There was an extra yellow wire that I never figured out what it was for. I also knew the voltage by the label on the brick (oddly, it wasn't labeled on the computer itself if memory serves)\n\nI matched the voltage on my bench supply exactly to that marked on the brick, confirmed with a multimeter to be sure, and then held my breath and connected it. \n\nProgress! The fan began to spin and the power light came on. Good. The power light was amber, though, and flashing. Maybe not so good? Unless it was unhappy over not having a monitor? Hooked one up and tried again. Nothing on the screen. It was obvious there was still a problem.\n\nI looked up the flash code and it translated to RAM error. Well, I swapped RAMs between the 2 slots, and it still got the same error. Darn. Tried a spare RAM that fit. No dice. I looked up different types of RAM to make sure the one I had on hand was actually compatible. Looks like it should have worked.\n\nOscilloscope time! On the RAM, I can make out a few vias that I can probe with the scope probe. They are facing straight up, mounted similar to the way that a laptop's RAM would be mounted. So this particular job is ironically easier than it would be in a tower computer. Well, I can't find anything that looks active while the computer should be running (i.e. the power light is on / flashing). All I can find are steady voltages. This isn't looking good. \n\nIf you've studied computer science or taken such classes, you might remember something called the \"North bridge\" on the motherboard. This is a chip that interfaces between CPU and RAM. What I've discovered with the scope looks like the RAM is not getting anything from the motherboard. So basically, it's looking like a bad motherboard, unless there's a chip that can be easily resoldered.\n\nI stripped everything that was socketed, and find that, what do you know, the CPU is in a socket! That was somewhat unexpected in a mini-desktop, given that they would have wanted to save space and money for a small system. \n\nWith the motherboard out, I can't find a chip close enough to the RAM that it's obviously associated with it (I was hoping for an SMD package with pins on only two sides) so it's probably just a bad motherboard. I was hoping for a voltage regulator in an easily soldered package (There are some SMDs that aren't that hard to work with, but I digress)\n\nWell, I found an online shop that primarily dealt with laptop parts, but also had a few desktop motherboards as well, mostly from mini PCs or all in one computers. Well, they've got the right motherboard, but let me just look up the price of a new computer of this caliber, so I can be transparent with my client about that.\n\nA brand new mini computer of similar specs cost significantly more than just the motherboard (which was actually surprising given that it didn't have a separate GPU nor even a slot for such) so I went to my client with both prices. And also, the price of a new power brick, so he'll be able to plug the computer in properly when it is fixed.\n\nAfter a delay, he authorized me to go ahead, so I bought the new motherboard along with the power brick. The parts arrived and I rebuilt the PC. I pushed the button, and it.... flashes amber in the same pattern. Well fsck. \n\nOkay, so it wasn't the motherboard, the only thing left that could cause a totally blank screen - never mind the supposed RAM error - HAD to be the CPU - The only other thing left was the hard drive and if it were bad, almost all PCs will show something on the screen in that case (unless it shorted, but then it would smell when I tried to turn it on and my bench supply would have gone into protect mode: which also rules out a shorted CPU or RAM) Oh, and there's also a separate WiFi card as well as the front panel I/O, but again, those wouldn't prevent it from booting.\n\nI sheepishly admitted to my client that I was wrong about the motherboard, and it must be the CPU instead. I found a reasonably priced, used CPU from a seller that had a good reputation. (couldn't get it new as it was an older CPU) I decided that I would try to return the motherboard to the store, and hope they will accept a \"good part, but didn't solve my problem\" return, and if they don't I'll just have to eat the cost. Thankfully, they did accept the return. The client approved the cost of the CPU, and in fact the CPU cost even less than the motherboard did. \n\nThe new CPU arrived, and I redo the whole rigmarole of installing one. With confidence, I hooked up the power brick and Manufacturer's logo appeared on the monitor. Sure enough, it got all the way through booting and asked for a password. Luckily, I didn't need the password: the PC booted up when it didn't before. Just to be sure, I checked that I could move the cursor with the mouse and type in the password field with the keyboard. Indeed, that worked, and every USB port worked.\n\nNow, some might have booted from another hard drive or something to see if it worked okay, but given the nature of the original problem, that didn't seem necessary. Plus, the client didn't live so far as to make a return trip that impractical, and if he took it back to me I wouldn't have charged him again.\n\nWith that, I contacted the client and let him know his computer was fixed. I delivered the computer to him and got paid for my time, the CPU and the power brick. \n\nIn retrospect, had I looked up what a North Bridge was or the memory controller, I would have discovered that those functions in modern computers are part of the CPU itself, rather than separate chips on the motherboard. So I might have saved myself some time that way. But some lessons you end up learning the hard way. Thankfully, it wasn't the kind of thing that damaged previously good hardware or caused data loss.\n\nTL;DR: I thought the motherboard was bad when it was throwing a spurious \"RAM error\" code, due to my outdated ideas of how motherboards and CPUs work. It was the CPU.",

        "text": "Aight, this one should be short and sweet. Been a while since my last post, so hopefully I don't bump into any new rules along the way.\n\nBackstory: At the time of this story, I'd recently started work at a small IT support company which had various remote clients (about 15 to 20 minutes drive from our main office). Most of what we did involved remote support, but there was often on-site work as well.\n\nOne particular client I'm going to call Woodies Woodworking or **$WW** for short. Our contract with Woodies involves basic maintenance of their onsite hardware, which usually is just the bi-monthly emptying of saw dust in the cases. Today however, they'd just re-opened after a holiday period and noticed their file server was down.\n\nJessica from **$WW** (**$WW_J**) calls to request support for this one while I'm out on site with another client. She informs me the server is down, and I give her instructions on how to identify if it's powered on. I verify that it's not online on Anydesk or Teamviewer, and in this time **$WW_J** has decided to start rebooting anything tech related in what she thought was the server room.\n\nNow to be clear, I'd never worked with **$WW_J** let alone worked on their site before this day. So I was piloting a non-tech savvy client, blind folded, into finding a server I didn't know where it was and identify the issue with it. We quickly gave up and assigned this as a service call, and I went out on site once I'd wrapped up with my current client.\n\nBy the time I rock up, **$WW_J** was on break and I was left with her co-worker, Karl (**$WW_K**). **$WW_K** was slightly more tech savvy but not quite enough. When asked to take me to his server room, **$WW_K** took me to his main fiber ingress point to the complex - a messy cabinet in the break room of cables and haphazardly arranged networking components - a wifi router here, a 24 port gigabit ethernet switch there...\n\nAt this point I recall during handover from the previous tech, that **$WW** was using a series of cheap NUCs purchased from a certain Chinese online retailer, and these served predominately their office staff, but also their file server. So, going into the office section of the complex, I found it - a NUC sitting in the back corner of the (absent) manager's overcrowded with junk office, alongside two WD reds sitting in an offline external USB caddy, and the cause of all our problems.\n\n**$WW** had cleaning staff come in a week before they opened back up. These staff had used any available power point to power their vacuum cleaners. One such powerpoint they chose to use, was an occupied one - The servers. And rather than restore the machine, they simply left it powered off. Nobody knew where this server was, or even that it was a server, and so it just stayed off until I switched it back on.\n\nFortunately no data was lost, the server was back up and running in about 10 minutes, and considering how busy I was we called it at that. I'd later go on to move their server into the same cabinet as their networking spaghetti, put a lock on it, and give the manager the only spare key.",

        "text": "I work for a company that hosts mobile devices through the cloud that customers can use to test their apps and software on. As this is in-development software, it’s pretty common that users do stuff that make the devices restart or disconnect from the server. It’s my job to then go fix the device and bring it out of error. Some customers throw their devices into error all the time and some rarely do. Most customers are pretty easy to work with but sometimes people can be a little… silly. \n\nWe have one customer that likes to act like ever device in error is the end of the world. It is common that we will email them saying we brought the device out of error and they will respond saying, why is this happening so often. Please fix root cause. But there isn’t anything to fix, and device isn’t actually going into error often. \n\nLast week, this customer responded to a resolved ticket saying the device was going into error all the time and we needed to fix it. I checked the case history for the device, including monitoring, and found that this was the first time this device had been in error in a month. We don’t really worry about a device going into error often until it starts going into error daily. A device going into error weekly is nothing to bat an eye at. That’s a pretty common rate for a device that is being used heavily for testing. So I just responded to the customer and told them that a device going into error once a month didn’t count as often, and they can monitor on their side and let us know if they keep seeing problems with it. I left the ticket on auto close if they didn’t respond within the next few days. They didn’t and the ticket closed. \n\nToday, they responded to a resolved ticket saying the device goes into error every other day and we need to fix it so it stops doing that already. I looked up the device and discovered that it had been connected to hosting for the first time 2 days ago. \n\nIn other words, this was the very first time this device had ever gone into error. I was laughing so hard when I realized they really were just raising a stink for no reason. \n\nTLDR: Rule #1. Users always lie.",

I sent them a screenshot of the message on the site showing that they should have sent me an email to the email they were talking to.

He was the former head of a national political party and in the running to be Prime Minister at one time. We were under instructions to keep the guy happy. Fair enough. \n\nSo we didn't actually provide or support Blackberrys, and it was a bit of a surprise to get a support call for one of them, but again, Mister C was Important, so I went along to see what the problem was. \n\nI arrived to Mister C's office and had a look at his blackberry. Sure enough, it had been remote wiped and bricked. I gently brought up that this looks like it had happened, and asked where it came from. He said \"I got it from parliament, I use it every day\". Being a follower of news, I again gently said \"I don't presume to know your business, but I recall you didn't run for re-election 6 months ago, do you think that because you're no longer a member of parliament, that might be why?\" .. the proverbial lightbulb went off and he said glumly.. \"hmm, yeah, I think that's possible\".\n\nI never heard from him again, and he went on to become an ambassador, and state governor",

The owner was my old high-school Geology teacher, but the real hook was that my stoner brother was the new assistant manager there so I'd be getting calls for help regardless of whether I was being paid for them or not.\n\nAround six months after agreeing to support them I get a call at my day job from the owner, saying that the receipt printer 'smells funny'.\n\nI ask him to elaborate.\n\n&gt;Owner: You know how when you wear a coat around a campfire, and then, even though it's been washed you'll still occasionally catch whiffs of smoke?\n\n&gt;Me: You need to unplug the printer and send that coat to a dry cleaner. I'll be over tonight.\n\nThat evening, with an anxious owner leaning over my shoulder, I popped the printer open. The cause of the smell was easy enough.\n\n&gt;Me: The problem is all this fluff. The paper rubs on the metal guides here, and it builds up here, on the parts that get hot, so you have to clean it out once in a while.\n\nI pulled the roll of paper out, picked up a can of electronics duster still conveniently located right next to the register from when I'd had the exact same conversation with the manager just over three months previous, and give the printer a nice quick spritz.\n\n&gt;Me, popping the paper back in: There you go. Fixed.\n\n&gt;Owner: How often does that need to be done? \n\n&gt;Me: Once a week? I suggested the manager add it to his opening duties on Monday last time I was here, guess he forgot.\n\nTwo months later I was out to have a look at a flickering monitor (loose VGA cable) and gave the whole thing a once over. Ugh, the keyboard has crumbs in it, so I pick up the can of duster, still conveniently located right next to the register, and.. \n\nNothing.\n\nOh, wait. There's a case of them right here underneath the counter, and there's even a couple of cans left in it! I grab a can out, start cleaning the keyboard, and get interrupted by the clerk grabbing it from my hand.\n\n&gt;Clerk: Dude! We've only got two cans left to last the week!\n\n&gt;Me: A can should last you months! What the hell have you been doing with them?\n\nSo he shows me. He opens the printer, removes the paper, and sprays away at nothing in particular for almost a minute.\n\n&gt;Clerk: And we gotta do that every time we change the paper or it catches fire. Jerry got burned and went to the hospital when he forgot once.\n\n&gt;Me: I should've gotten a call if this had caught fire, and who the hell is Jerry?\n\n&gt;Clerk: Some guy that use to work here, like years ago, I dunno.\n\nI tell the clerk that he doesn't need to dust the printer ever again and call the owner to ask him about Jerry, a printer fire, and a possible hospital visit. He's never employed a Jerry, the printer has never caught fire, and the last worker's comp case he had was an idiot that thought he should climb the shelves and do a King Kong impression.\n\n&gt;Owner: Still, I've been through ten cans of electronics duster just this month?! That shit's like three bucks a can!\n\n&gt;Me: Yeah. According to the label on the box it was only delivered three weeks ago.\n\n&gt;Owner: Are you sure they're not huffing it or something? I mean, I hire a lot of my students, and it's not like I teach AP classes. Look for teeth marks on the nozzles.\n\nNo teeth marks. What actually happened was somehow stupider than teenagers huffing. See, he'd told the manager to clean it on Monday, and that's where a game of stoner telephone started. The manager forgot to do it the very first time he was supposed to and told my brother to do it at close. So my brother did, every night, until one night when he felt lazy and asked a clerk to do it for him. \n\nAnd then the five part-time clerks played telephone amongst themselves, eventually leading to them cleaning it every time they put in a new roll of paper, and with increasing amounts of duster every time.",

Nope, nope. My initial thoughts: Maybe it is a hardware issue. I had also installed some old drivers (from the ancient motherboard CD) a few days back, using the compatibility mode. Could this be the reason? At this point, I was straight panicky and it must have showed on my face, because my wife came over and asked me what was wrong. Told her, she told me not to panic. I took a deep breath, calmed down a little. I remembered that I had take a a system image with Windows backup a few days ago. \n\nConnected the external drive, chose that system image and about 30 to 40 minutes later, everything was up and working. Besides the agony and anxiety of the entire experience, the data \"loss\", so to say (since I had restored to an earlier image) was minimal. The files for a windows 8.1 VM, were present in the C: drive and was gone. Created a new VM now and also backed it up. \n\nMy music, ebooks and other stuff reside in external drives, clouds and another hard disk on the PC. I usually create a system image backup once in two weeks, after this experience, once a week backup is a better idea (especially after windows updates).  Have also put in reminders to backup more regularly. Not even sure what could have caused the BSOD (for context, motherboard is ancient, it's an Asus P8B75-M LX, they have drivers for Windows 8.1 but nothing for Win 10. Am wary to experiment once again with these old drivers for Win 10). \n\nSo, please, please backup your data regularly and also, test it out. Whether you use the in built windows backup solution or third party utilities, it's up to you. Backing up something like your C: drive, does take quite some time and yes, while it is irritating, it can be a huge life saver. So, please backup your stuff regularly. Peace and out.",

        "text": "My role has shifted heavily away from the support department as of late but I do have to take the odd support call every now and then, which I have come to absolutely despise. People in other departments know me as someone they can escalate tickets to, which honestly pisses me off because not only do I barely do support anymore, I hate it when I do have to do it. But I've been with the company the longest out of my current department and the support team, so its only natural.\n\nIn December, a customer reported their organization's firewall was blocking access to our web software. The agent told her to report this to her IT and that we could assist if necessary, but it was her IT's prerogative to allow our software past *their* firewall. She said ok, the ticket was closed, and she gave us a 5 star rating. Its all documented in the email chain. Job done, for now.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, 2 months later. One of the account managers escalates her email to me. Basically, she hadn't used our equipment since December and was refusing to pay the fees for them because she \"couldn't use them\". I asked her if she ever got up with IT and she said no, and then said that WE we're supposed to contact their IT. What the hell...\n\nI told her I could see in the email chain that we explicitly instructed her to contact her IT and that she agreed to do so. All she said back was \"well, you're support for this equipment and I need support with this equipment, so provide the support\".\n\nNothing I said could get this woman to understand. She's demanding to be refunded 3 months of invoices because she made the deliberate decision to ignore what we told her. And now I'm having to schedule a call with her IT just to tell them that it's their firewall because this lady refuses to contact her IT herself.\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous. I truly hate the support department.",

        "text": "So I will be making things a tad vague here  and changing names around as this happened relatively recently .\n\nThe company I work for has various divisions around the world with several different email domains , but all of the IT department members are located in one regional area. \n\nSo lets say there is [Disney.com](https://Disney.com), [Disneyland.com](https://Disneyland.com) , [DisneyWorld.com](https://DisneyWorld.com) , [DisneyTokyo.com](https://DisneyTokyo.com) all of us have to remotely support , even if we all live in California so to speak.\n\nI mainly work out of the DisneyLand branch, but have a [Disney.com](https://Disney.com) account as that is out main company account and I need to have that authority to assist all the other sites...or its just for bookkeeping purposes, who knows.\n\nso with that preamble out of the way, lets get to the story \n\nI come into the Disneyland office on Saturday as despite everyone else on the [Disney.com](https://Disney.com) domain off for the weekend, I got to look after DisneyLand as its our money maker location.\n\nChecking my email I see no new tickets and the last email was before Midnight. \n\nI don't think too much on it, as weekends can occasionally be quiet and I am sure it will pick up later, it gives me the excuse to get caught up on projects. \n\nMy first inkling that something is off is that I try and send a email from my phone with some pictures I took for notes on a record updating matter, but I didn't think much of it, as gmail and attachments if often a pill. \n\nThings do get weirder as walking around people mention tickets I haven't seen, but I figure maybe they were sent while I was walking around working on the projects...but I am starting to get suspicious.\n\nThings really come to a head as I have to fix a major issue with one of our venders and their confirmation emails never come through.\n\nShit\n\nSo once the fires are put out, I try and test sending emails to myself, no luck. \n\nTried checking my 365 settings to see if anything was not check marked or recently changed...nope.\n\nSo I get on the Horn to our 365 support representative and they try and do some digging, but at this point of the day there is not much they can [do. So](https://do.So) it will have to wait until tomorrow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCome in on Sunday and first things first call up the 365 team and try and figure out what has happened to my email. Well they take about a hour to do some digging with the tier 2 staff and they found the issue.\n\n**Someone had changed the MX Record** \n\nIts at this point I have a Oh shit moment as I realize that all of the users in the main HQ email domain aren't getting emails, its not just me. These are the people who control the finances of the company.\n\nThe only reason no one else has said anything is they are all off for the weekend while I sit in a basement office with a carpet probably last changed in the 70s.\n\nThankfully I get the new MX record from 365 and get a hold of the company its owned by.\n\nWith a bit of digging with a lovely support agent I learn that the MX record changed late Friday, roughly around midnight, so that would match up with the last email I got.\n\nAnd who should change it, but our CEO Michael Eisner.\n\nDamn it...should have known.  He likes to stick his nose in random matters of the company\n\nIts definitely him, as the MX company has personal records and bank statements to confirm its him. \n\nWell I can't change it back as I don't have those pieces of info and if the lowest person in the IT totem pole does, then our data security is garbage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI alert the rest of the IT team as this is a all hands on deck situation , emails that go to the highest tier of our company aren't coming through .\n\nOur team looks into it and it turns out what the MX record rep said wasn't quite accurate.\n\nAs our CEO never made theses changes.\n\nSomeone , somehow got a hold of personal details and bank details to fake being him and make the change.\n\nTook several days to confirm what happened and fully fix things .\n\nBut because I was paying attention , I prevented the malicious individual access to our companies incoming emails for likely 30 + hours before everyone else would have noticed on Monday.\n\nAnd to no ones shock, as the IT person who found this.\n\nNever thanked by anyone from head office....of course.",

        "text": "So i was working for a company that produced parts for oil processing and we had customers/Partners all over the world. One day we had a prep from an american partner of ours at our head quarters in Germany, were i worked. He stayed at a guest room on our site for a few days. That guy, Let's call him Joe, was a bit... special. You will see what i mean by that. \n\nI worked there as a System Admin in Charge of the network infrastructure, so people, who had a Problem would call our internal Hotline and get put through to me, if i was needed. That's where our story begins, when i first talked to Joe. He had an issue with the Network and since i was already at our Server room, i checked the patch Panels and yes, the port he was trying to use, wasn't hooked up, because we usually just hook them up, once they are needed. I said to him, if that port would make Trouble again, he could call me. Oh boy, that one line propably was the worst mistake of the day.\n\nIt was at night, i think around 3 or 4 am on a saturday, when my phone Rang. The day before, my neighbours had a party, so i was a bit drunk and i get a bit annoyed, when drunk me gets woken up. It was Joe, who tried to do a skype meeting with his wife at home (late at night due to time zones and so on). To this day, i don't know, how he got my private number, but he said he couldn't do anything and wanted it fixed asap. Given my tired, drunk, annoyed state, i only told him to wait till monday, because i didn't work that weekend.\n\nOn the next morning, i saw 14(!) missed calls by that guy, so i blocked his number, to save my sanity. When i came Back to work on monday, i was greeted by joe, looking up to me (I'm nearly 2m tall and he could bearly reach my chest) with a nasty smile on his face. \"I'll get you fired!\" He said and went to my Bosses office. I just shook my head and went to my desk. Half an hour or so later came my boss and asked, what i did to Joe, who tried to convince him of firing me, because i would be drunk at my job. I told him the story, showed him the calls and he laughed and went off. I later learned, that joe would leave on tuesday, so as a goodbye present, i printed out the paragraphs about firing people, from German law and layed them at his desk. Once he found them, he came to me and screamed, what this bulls*/# was about. I only told him that he should know the laws, if he tries to threaten people\n\nThat was the last time i saw joe and the last time anyone called me late at night",

        "text": "To reduce recognizability i'll avoid details as much as possible. tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nI work as 3rd level support for a company that develops and provides software for a business area, that's quite heavily regulated, a lot of our development efforts go to just keeping up with new and changing laws. Also the software, while being mainly used for one purpose, usually in one way or the other gets used throughout the whole company using it, so with bigger companies, they sometimes have multiple departments, each only supporting parts of the software in-house, basically each department of the company having their own in-house tech-support for our software.\n\nSo with this one customer. They have one main-support-team (containing, but not led by the CTO of the company) for our software and each department has their own sub-team who answer to the head of the main-team. As always, new years had brought new laws and regulations. Especially in one department, an up to now optional feature became mandatory by law starting 01.01.23. Mind you, the information about the new law was public in February 22 and our software supports this feature since the middle of 21. So enough time to configure, test and move to production with it, right? Unfortunately, as it's an extremely technical topic, i'm currently the only person in our company's support-team with in-depth knowledge. We're working on changing that, but not everyone who works in support has a background deeply rooted in software development, so it takes time.\n\nWell, starting January this one sub-department, basically a one man show, as it's a rather small department at the customer started sending support tickets \"this isn't working with the new feature\", \"that isn't working with the new feature\" and so on, 7 Tickets total, all highest priority, because \"it's an error message and we're legally required to use it\". Each and every one of the tickets I answered them the exact passage of the manual where they could read up that exact error message, explaining how it's a missing configuration on their end and exactly (with screenshots!) what to configure. These configurations are not part of any kind of support plan we offer, so work on these tickets is a \"pay by hour\" thing for the company. Never got any reply to them so considered them done with that.\n\nWell, i guessed wrong. I got another highest priority support-ticket today stating it's not working. Obviously i asked, if the configurations i sent over in the other tickets have been done, to which i get the reply, how should they know, they're just back from a multi-week vacation. I politely replied, that he should check those configurations and to not cost them unnecessary money, i would hold off working on that ticket until he checked them.\n\nThe reply i received to that basically stated, that he found it very audacious that there are now 8 open highest priority requests about that topic and the company i worked at haven't moved a finger in the month since they were submitted and that he demands i hand over those tickets to someone else in our support-team, who actually wants to do our job or he will escalate the issue to the main team.\n\nNow, you should know that this customer is one of our biggest clients, so their requests inherently get slightly higher priority on our side and also we know that they generally (with a few black sheep obviously) have a very good in-house team, so the team is pretty liberal at routing their technical requests through to me. Because of that i get to work a lot with their main-team who handles those technical issues and the bigger the installation, the more troublesome. They enjoy working with me so much, that for the past half year or so we've been on a first name basis when communicating (including the CTO). An information, that obviously hadn't reached this poor soul yet.\n\nSo, to spare him the work of escalating the issue, according to process i wrote a formal escalation mail (using first names, petty, i know) to the lead of their main team, as well as my team-lead cc-ing the guy from the sub-team, informing them about all the highest priority tickets, including detailed information since when the feature is available, when the information about it becoming mandatory by law was publizised and when it became mandatory, compiling the answers from all the tickets into one and also sending an official, detailed by ticket, offer with which they could purchase service from us to do those configurations for them. I also included a letter from our legal team that every customer had received about half a year ago, that we are not liable for any damages they incur by not testing the feature before the legal date.\n\nAbout an hour later i got a formal answer from one of their main-team that the configurations i sent have been implemented and every issue has been resolved, the feature works as intended, thanking me for bringing to their attention that they were behind on that topic, followed half a minute later by an informal mail informing me that i don't need to worry, the next person to submit tickets on behalf of that one-person department should be much more professional.\n\nAnd the moral of the story: Don't try to threaten with authority you don't have.\n\ntl;dr: Customer-Employee threatened to report me not doing his job while he went on vacation, got fired for it.",
