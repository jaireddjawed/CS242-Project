        "text": "So I just finished reading Salman Rushdie's newest book, 'Victory City' and I wanted to see what other people thought about the book.I had only read one other Rushdie book up till now, the iconic 'Midnight's Children', It became one of my favorite books so I was looking forward to Victory City. In the end I thought that VC was a very good book, but didn't really live up to the heights of Midnight's Children. \n\nI will say that Victory City is a much easier book to read, I was able to finish it in one sitting. With MC, I did have to take a few breaks since the book is (I think purposefully) very overwhelming. The characters are also complex and are, as far as I am aware, good renditions of their historical counterparts. Also, while the book is very far from a comedy, it does have a few funny moments. The story also has a pretty cool framing device. From what little I know about the history of Vijayanager it seems like Rushdie did his research, and you can tell he is pulling a lot of inspiration from Indian literature.\n\nAs an aside, I do wonder if knowing more about the Vijayanagar empire would have changed my perception of the book. I already knew a quite bit about 20th century Indian history going into Midnight's Children and I thought that that really hieghtened the experience. I really only knew the basics about the Vijayanagar empire so maybe that may have affected my experience.\n\nOn the otherhand Victory City felt like a much simpler novel to me, it is about 100 pages shorter than MC so maybe that should be expected. Still it was somewhat dissapointing that the tale of the rise and fall of an empire could feel so small. The prose is also much simpler than in Midnight's Children. I know that some people may prefer that, but I did enjoy the experience of reading Midnight's Children alot more. Also the themes and ideas felt, not simpler per se, but less fully explored in Victory City. This I think makes the book a lot more accessible and easily engrossing, but it doesn't quite feel as layered as  MC.\n\nTo me Victory City felt like a well guided tour through a beautiful meuseum with a passionate tour guide. Midnight's Children felt like you were living through the birth of a new nation and feeling all the emotions, fear, uncertainty, etc, that go along with that alongside the characters. Maybe that had something to do with the POV of the books? The main character in Victory City is somewhat more detached from the story than Saleem Sinai and his family were in their story.\n\nAnyways, despite all that, I think that Victory City was a pretty decent read,somewhere between 3.5-4 out of 5 for me. I just wanted to air my thoughts and see what you guys had to say about it. I unfortunately didn't see a lot of discussion about the book on reddit. There is an excerpt from the book to see if maybe you guys might be interested in it.\n\n[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/12/12/a-sackful-of-seeds](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/12/12/a-sackful-of-seeds)",

I really enjoyed Parker-Chan's flowing, descriptive narratives. I also liked how little aspects of fantasy intermingled with the historical narrative. I think my favourite aspect of the book was actually the descriptions of the landscapes. I also liked how I was able to enjoy this book without having any historical knowledge whatsoever. Yes, there might've been some parts that confused me (which reflects nothing about the author and everything about my unknowledgeable and often distracted self), but I was able to truly enjoy the descriptive paintings of setting, the character descriptions, and the flow of the plot. Oh, and the ending was particularly beautiful in my opinion.\n\nOverall, great book, amazing author in my opinion.\n\nNow, as usual, I'm not sure what to read next.\n\nI would love to hear others' opinions about this amazing read :)",

But I can only focus on one at a time and it takes me at least 3 days to finish a 400 page novel. I have about 10 800+ page novels on my bookshelf that beckon me each morning. I wish I could read faster! I wish I could read at least twice as fast but still retain and understand the sorry. I don’t want to read faster in order to get my “book count” up; I want to read faster so I can read as many amazing books as I can before I die because I’m scared I’ll miss out on the many stories that could change me and make me better or that I would simply enjoy. \n\nIs it possible to increase my reading speed while still enjoying and comprehending what I read?",

The chip scene? Had potential but was ultimately something I’d expect from a five year old to their mother.\n\nThe storm scene? He injured himself unnecessarily because he thought she would scared. All he had to do was put on shoes, but he didn’t because she was his top priority- above even his own health. Which isn’t healthy or okay and is only something you’d expect from again, a child.\n\nHer even being interested in him felt like those guys who like high needs autistic women because of their codependency. \n\nIt’s creepy, and weird.\n\nI had to skip any spicy scenes because they reminded me of ‘Tampa’ by Alissa Nutting. The book that is literally about a pedophile.\n\nIf he can’t hold a conversation (ability to speak not relevant) then generally speaking he shouldn’t be having sex.\n\nI don’t know if it’s just me, but I felt almost nauseas reading it.",

Perhaps it's in the translation or perhaps it's something about the way Chinese sentence structures map to English ones, I don't know, I wouldn't call myself a very good writer anyways. So as a thought exercise, I copied an excerpt over to ChatGPT and asked it to \"Rewrite the following excerpt with better prose\". I thought I would share the results.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Original (From the beginning of Chapter 4):\\*\\*\n\n\"Wang Miao thought the four people who came to find him made a rather odd combination: two cops and two men in military uniforms. If the latter two were armed police, that would be somewhat understandable, but they were actually PLA officers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as Wang saw the cops, he felt annoyed. The younger one was all right -- at least he was polite. But the other one, in plainclothes, immediately grated on him. He was thickset and had a face full of bulging muscles. Wearing a dirty leather jacket, smelling of cigarettes, and speaking in a loud voice, he was exactly the sort of person Wang despised.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe way the cop addressed him by name only, so direct and impolite, made Wang uncomfortable. Adding to the insult, the man lit a cigarette as he addressed him, without even lifting his head to show his face. Before Wang could answer, the man nodded at the younger cop, who showed Wang his badge.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*ChatGPT:\\*\\*\n\nAs Wang Miao caught sight of the group that had come to locate him, he couldn't help but think that they were a curious combination. Two police officers and two military men in uniform - a most unusual pairing indeed. Wang might have been able to rationalize it better if the latter two were armed police, but to his surprise, they were actually PLA officers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the mere sight of the cops, Wang was overcome with irritation. The younger of the two officers seemed decent enough - at least he was courteous. However, the other officer, who wore plain clothes, immediately rubbed Wang the wrong way. He had a stocky build, bulging muscles, and a face that appeared to match his rough demeanor. Clad in a grimy leather jacket and reeking of tobacco, this officer spoke in a loud voice that grated on Wang's nerves. Indeed, Wang realized that this officer was precisely the kind of person he despised.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe manner in which the cop addressed Wang by name alone, in such a direct and impolite way, only made Wang feel more uneasy. Adding to the offense, the man lit a cigarette without so much as lifting his head to reveal his face. Before Wang could even respond, the officer nodded to the younger cop, who promptly displayed his badge.",

Bens natural instinct to this was to think \"i've never wanted to physically harm a girl before\"\nNOT ONLY IS THIS DISGUSTING BUT ITS NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED AS BAD.\nThe worst part is a scene that involves a ra**\nit's romanticized, Fallon doesn't feel comfortable with this but as she's begging to say no nothing comes from her, which is a trauma reaction, speechlessness. Ben still does with her as he pleases, and he gets no punishment. It was romanticized. That is NOT okay. Imagine all the possible people reading this, who have experienced something to the extend of that, and when they feel bad about it, they think it's okay because a role mode of theirs is romanticizing it. \nNot only is that awful, Ben was stalking her before they met, and Ben wanted to \"repay\" for making her have scars, BUT HE STALKED HER. \nHe cheated on her.\nHe ra*** her.\nHe stalked her.\nHe lied to her.\nAnd it was all wrapped up with a bow at the end essentially saying that it was \"for love\"\nThat is toxic. SO TOXIC. \nFallon ends up with Ben, and at the end they live \"happily ever after\"\nthis is not ok.\nNor will it ever be ok. \nand when people backlash on Colleen for writing this book, romanticizing the abuse in it, she went on Facebook live, and essentially said that in the beginning Fallon said everything that happened to her she didn't want to happen to her, so it was supposed to be irony. Not not only is that awful and it should not be used as irony, or a joke, she didn't apologize for making them end up together. She didn't apologize for romanticizing that she apologize for anything of this.\n\n\nUGLY LOVE : \n\nThis book genuinely brought out the worst in me, the amount of cringe, toxicity, and overall sexism in this book was rage inducing.\n\ni kid you not i was THROWING MY INSIDES OUT AND VOMITNG whenever I was reading Miles's pov. Miles literally sees Rachel and falls in \"love\" in milliseconds...Like WTF??? They barely know each other and yet they fall in \"love\" when in reality, whatever they had was a sexual sensation based on their appearance. ridiculous right??.Now this is when it gets even grosser. ITS NASTY DUDES.\n their parents are DATING. THEY ARE STEP SIBLINGS.\nSO ROMANTIC AM I RIGHT???!!\nanyways\nthey hook up and Rachel gets pregnant. \nWhat a surprise whoopie...\n\nRachel has the baby, and the two of them are soooooooo in love, and their planning their whole life and then. \nWHABAM\nThe baby dies.\nNOW YOU MUST BE WONDERING \n\"gabby why the hell are you joking about by this, their baby is DEAD\"\nthe baby is a plot twist and is only there ti\nmake miles life gain more sympathy, and make Rachel drift apart from them.\nThey break up blah blah blah and their so \"sad\" about losing their \"light of their lives\"\n*que the sarcasm*\n\nThe whole miles and and rachel's plotline was just so dumb and overdramatic and overhyped. \nEveryone praised Miles and put him on a pedestal when in reality he's a toxic, brooding teenager, who has a infatuation on women the moment he seems them and making himself look like the victim \n\nnow..tate and miles..\n\nTate was a spike in the road tbh. Miles basically said he wansts to use her as a sex toy and she went along with it, even though she claims she's \"so emotionally in love\". \n\nHe litterally called her rachel while they were doing the deed and he didn't even care after. \n\nThis relationship was clearly so damaging smh\n\nMiles is a wreck and people need to stop putting the \"bad boy with trauma\" trope on a pedestal. \n\nThere was a scene that i saw a lot of my friends talk about, and talking about how \"moving\"\nit was to miles character. SMHHHH GUYS.\nIt was so rushed, Rachel tells him he can love again and that finding love will make the past hurt less. He then runs to Tate to proclaim his undying love for her and BAM. Happily ever after.\n\nMiles is solely dependent on tate as a therapy dog, like he's only using her to make him forget about his past. \n\nOn top of this, when Miles professed his love, to Tate he didn't even apologize for any of shit he did before, like using her, calling her the wrong name, walking over her boundaries, and physically and emotionally putting her off as though she was an object to be used and put away with. \n\nNot to mention the amount of sexism in this bookkkkkk\n\nTate's lack of respect for herself, Corbin's overprotection of tate, Miles's possessiveness, it's not blantently sexist, but based on the authors other books and the hidden details within this one, it's quite obvious. \nThis book sucks. just it's awful. It's bluntly romanticizing abuse and neglect emotionally and physically. It's just the worst.",

I enjoy first contact novels especially, but this one is more satisfying than I expected. Moon has other female protagonists, who are warriors or starship captains, but this story leans into traditionally feminine experience as well as the experience of old age. Ophelia is a widow, a cook, a mother, a gardener, an undereducated colonist who makes daring intelligent choices and succeeds in unlikely ways. The aliens are interesting and well imagined. The whole book, but the conclusion of the story especially, could be compared to a long complicated judo move. Ophelia uses her willpower, curiousity, goodheartedness, insight and experience to find and use personal and political leverage. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants a different version of science fiction than is traditionally written.",

Ig I'm trying to determine if my standards are too high?\n\nAt a bare minimum I expect published works to have a) coherent &amp; cohesive plot/narrative, b) coherent &amp; cohesive world building if applicable, c) writing at a level quality that the reader will not constantly be pulled out of the story by it, and d) character motivations that make sense internally *as well as* externally.\n\nThe three aforementioned books that I regarded as not publication ready all lacked in at least one of the above factors. And they were all works of high-concept queer fantasy which is really disappointing bc I would have really liked to have liked all of them. One was self-published, so I suppose we can exclude that one from the rest of this conversation.\n\nOn the one hand, I suppose I could interpret \"high concept queer fantasy\" as a nascent subgenre and it might make sense for there to be some growing pains as the subgenre develops but I'm struggling to think of another genre or subgenre I've observed having similar issues? For instance, the \"millennial ennui\" genre comes to mind as similarly nascent, but all of the books I've read from that subcategory, even if I disliked them, at least met my expectations for published works.\n\nIdk, are my expectations too high? Late last year I came out of a years-long reading slump, so maybe publishing standards have changed since 2017? Or maybe my standards changed unreasonably?\n\n(I will also point out that in the same time frame of the last four months I've read high-concept queer fantasy that *did* read as publication ready to me so it's not an issue inherent to the subgenre)",

Ive actually been having a lot of fun picking books and seeing suggestions!\n\nBut I find I’m just soooo bored at the beginning, it’s hard for me to get into the stories. And when I have finished the books, I’ve been kind of disappointed. Im not sure what I’m doing wrong because I love reading, but the books that other people love I find not great. \n\nIm currently reading The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I honestly am not excited about after starting it. I also tried to start The Book Thief, but couldn’t get into. \n\nI just read Where the Crawdads Sing, which I finished pretty quickly, but found the second half awful. \n\nThen I just finished Still Missing, which just felt disappointing again. \n\nI did start A Gentleman in Moscow and The Song of Achilles, but they were returned to the library and waiting for them again. These ones I felt more excited about, but still a slow burn. \n\nI think I also have aphantasia which makes it hard to see the story in my mind.

I don't know that any other book I've read has had so many villains and/or given me such a strong urge to punch people in the face.  \n\nDespite the high villain to hero ratio, there is a lot of tremendous good in this book as well, and I enjoyed the historical backdrop of an America in change, from WWI through the Great Depression, women gaining the right to vote, and from sort of a Victorian sensibility to a modern one in both society and scientific method and understanding. \n\nI'm not after books specifically set during this time period or in the US, but would like to find ones that involve a search for justice in some way, set in either a stable-but-interesting time period, or during a period of change for the society. If it helps stoke my urge to bend the laws of physics as we know them, so much the better.",

I don't like the idea of bookclubs either.\n\nI do feel like my reviews tend to ramble a little though. Sometimes I'm just recounting the scenes and talking a little about how I felt about them.

        "text": "I had this book recommended to me since it was/is supposed to be a really good thriller. \n\nTalk about the biggest bait and switch in terms of genre. The “thriller” part didn’t even start until the last 100 pages of it. It was sooo rushed during those last 100 pages. Up until that point it was written like an average Literature &amp; Fiction book, which is fine but not what I was expecting for a book labeled thriller. \n\nIf certain things were rewritten or removed it would have improved the thriller-ness. \n\nLike: \n-In the prologue instead of Sydney in her mom’s hospital room, as a very weak red herring, &gt;!have her digging her mom’s grave in the garden!&lt; then the next day doing all the tour stuff.\n-Remove all of Theo’s POV chapters, and hype up Sydney’s paranoia of him being “onto” her or her thinking he’s more involved in the disappearances.\n-For all the people “disappearing” Sydney/Theo don’t seem too concerned until the last 100 pages other than vague anger to gentrification of the neighborhood, and then quickly forgotten. &gt;!Drea’s disappearance tho is present on Sydney’s mind-if she was deceased in a hidden passageway in an uncooled apartment hard to believe that no one could smell her anywhere else in the house. I almost expected Sydney or Theo involved in her death, considering how much anguish Sydney was in!&lt;\n-The &gt;!lab!&lt; being the bbeg behind everything is simultaneously low hanging fruit and coming out of left field to why they were nabbing everyone. &gt;!I felt like it would have been more nefarious/foreshadowing if they had doctors trying to go door to door for “wellness checks” and then the disappearances of folks. Rather than “oh Mr. Perkins moved” and try bait &amp; switch that it’s Bill Bil the real estate guy. If the whole point is “Black folks are suspicious of doctors/labs for good reasons re: history” it could be leaned more into than Sydney generally disliking that they’re in the area.!&lt;\n-While I generally don’t care for romance subplots, they’re fine if written well but this generally felt like filler and definitely didn’t need the sex scene 2 page description \n\nSorry if a bit rambly, just don’t have anyone to talk to about it",

        "text": "Hi everyone. First of all, let me start this by apologizing by my bad English. It is not my mother language so there will be probably a few errors in this post. I'm sorry.\n\nSo, I've decided to start reading books because I feel like I want to become a better person in general. I'm kinda late as I'm 20 years old (almost 21 :/ ) and didn't ever read a book but better late than never, am I right? As a beginner, I wanna start with books that will make me think about life and stuff like that. Stuff like philosophy, morality, society, human race, etc. Do you understand what I'm trying to say? I want something that will make me QUESTION about things like something with a very deep meaning. Something that will make me say to myself \"are humans actually right? Or are the wrong?\". KIND OF like Mandela type of things, you know? Kinda of like Nietzsche type of things. I want a book that will activate my critical thinking quite a lot, you know what I mean? Something like - *“Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.” — James Clear (from Atomic Habits).* I also loved this quote a lot - *“As long as you are alive, you will either live to accomplish your own goals and dreams or be used as a resource to accomplish someone else’s.” — Grant Cardone (from The 10X Rule).* I picked that quote but it was one of my favorite but that's basically the type of things I'm aiming for.\n\nSoooo, I could say that the genre I want is philosophy(?) or books about critical thinking. Well, I don't really know a specific genre for what I'm asking. I'm sorry but that's the closest thing I could get. Maybe that's it. Maybe it's not. I'm still kinda bad with picking genres and things like that. I'm really sorry. Anyways, I hope you could understand what I was trying to say and I'll try to leave a list of examples that could you help suggest me more books even though I still didn't read any.\n\n(Picked from a webiste as an example of the books I'm looking for. Keep in mind I never read any of these. So you could suggest me one of these top 5 as well if you'd like to.) Top 5 Books That Will Shift Your Perspective &amp; Stay With You Forever:\n\n1. Atomic Habits by James Clear\n2. Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It by Kamal Ravikant\n3. Principles by Ray Dalio\n4. Essentialism by Greg McKeown\n5. Beyond Good and Evil by Nietzsche (I'll probably pick this one)\n\nThat's the end of this post. I'm really sorry if it's unnecessarily big but I want to be as specific as possible so it's easier to help you all suggest me a few good books for me to read. It will be my first book, so I want to start BIG, you know what I mean? It's very hard for me to pick things by myself, therefore I'm asking help here. I hope I didn't bother or annoy anyone with this post. If I did, I apologize as it wasn't my intention. I just really wanted to start a new big goal in my life which is reading books and feel the harmony about ***books***. Again, I'm sorry about the big wall of text and my bad English. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your week :) Stay safe everyone!",
