        "text": "Wasn't sure if what I'm trying to do is called a programmable sequencer or not as Google searches with HDL keywords don't yield any results, but it's how I'm thinking about it.\n\nSay I have a series of states : **STATE_A, STATE_B, STATE_C**.  Each one of these when called will run the same exact FSM_Z, a separate smaller FSM, but will seed input parameters to FSM_Z differently depending on which STATE it is.  So I have FSM of FSMs.  FSM_Z isn't too important in the context of this question, but thought I'd give it for background.\n\nI want to, upon some *trigger_bit*, be able to sequence the states in any order I want.  So one iteration I want to run:\n\n    A, B, A, C\n\nAnother iteration, I may want to run:\n\n    B, C, A, B\n\nIt can be whatever.  \n\nI've explored some thoughts below, but ultimately trying to understand if there's an efficient mechanism to do this, or a standard HDL coding flow in which to think and design it.\n\nI was originally thinking I’ll have a 4-bit register_X that will pre-program the sequence I want, before I hit a *trigger_bit*.  Like:\n\n    register_X[0]= run_state_A\n    register_X[1]= run_state_B\n    register_X[2]= run_state_C\n    register_X[3]= reserved\n\nbut that wouldn’t allow me to program a sequence with repeating states.\n\nI could make register_X longer (say 16 or 32 bits) and assign each state an ID (maybe it’s encoding) that is hex and run it that way.  So if want to run A, B, A, C and when that's done, then B, C, A, B, and if I give every 8 bits in a 32-bit register_X the state encoding I want to run:\n\n    state_A = 0xFA\n    state_B = 0xFB\n    state_C = 0xFC\n\n    register_X[7:0]   = 0xFA\n    register_X[15:8]  = 0xFB\n    register_X[23:16] = 0xFA\n    register_X[31:24] = 0xFC\n   \n    hit trigger_bit\n    get some \"done\" indicator\n\n    register_X[7:0]   = 0xFB\n    register_X[15:8]  = 0xFC\n    register_X[23:16] = 0xFA\n    register_X[31:24] = 0xFB\n\n    hit trigger_bit\n   \nI could code it this way, but it seems unwieldy and register_X can get pretty large depending on the number of states I want to sequence, and it doesn't seem efficient.\n\nI'm playing around with using a buffer (not quite a fifo) that I do a parallel load into from register space that programs the sequence I want, and then increment through that buffer till I get to the end of the buffer.\n\nOverall what I'm trying to do is maybe not a straight FSM, even though I call FSM sequences.  I guess it's how to sequence correctly some sequence that a user inputs to me, say specified from a set of configuration registers.\n\nAnyone have any other thoughts ?\n",

I did have the recent idea for a project creating a fan controller/addressable rgb controller all on one circuit board that could be controlled via software over a usb 2.0 header on a motherboard. But I realize this might be too large a jump starting off and probably need to start on something smaller. Any advice would be appreciated Thanks!",

I myself will be trying to familiarize myself with my Altera DE-1 and SystemVerilog during Winter Break. I started off as an EE major, and at my school, there are two different versions of Digital Logic for EE and CpE majors. In the EE version, you use a microcontroller instead of an FPGA, but even that isn't until the end of the semester for the final project. I've read a few things about SV, and that its similar to C++ due to it having OO concepts. Its good that I'm in a OO class right now that uses C++. \n\nNow what I would like to know, from somebody with experience, is what FPGA/ASIC design is all about. From what I've been able to infer, FPGA design is about designing the thing itself, then having other people configure it for w/e, while ASIC design is more like making a custom made computer.

        "text": "Evening folks,\n\nI'm trying to make a simple FSK-demodulator with my Arduino, but I've ran into some trouble.\n\nThe demodulator takes in a sinusoidal signal which varies between two frequencies, where the higher frequency represents a 1 and the lower a 0. The demodulator then outputs 1 or 0 according to the input signal.\n\nI wanted to solve this using simple digital low-pass and high-pass filters in parallell, comparing their amplitude and determining the correct output from that. I've made a crude figure to demonstrate this,\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/tPuAP\n\nI've put the code and output from a 1 kHz signal on\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/anonymous/80bd41c7d75e2e297b9aaf0645a49bac\n\nAny input is appreciated!\n\nEDIT: I completely forgot to state the problem. The low-pass filter looks about right to me, but I'm not sure of the high-pass filter. It varies quite a bit, in addition to becoming negative. Does it oscillate around 0? Perhaps my sampling frequency is too low? Anyway, the output never changes from 0 when I try to switch around on the frequencies.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the input! I managed to figure out where I was thinking wrong and altered the code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d31691bfdec19ba9e4369c09700407ed\nWorks like a charm!",

        "text": "*(If this isn't the correct sub for these questions apologies, I'd welcome suggestions about better places to ask.  x-posted at /r/AskScienceDiscussion, /r/Internet, and /r/ECE)*\n\nI want to understand on a technical, physical level **how the internet works** and **how it was developed**.  I would appreciate **recommendations of resources to learn (books, textbooks even, websites, articles)**, or if anyone's feeling generous, written explanations of how the technology works.\n\nI'd like to only spend a few hours reading and afterwards have a basic, simple, technically correct understanding.  I'd *also* like recommendations for more in-depth reading for when I have more time to spend learning.\n\nI've already been looking around for several hours for good resources, but it's hard to know which ones are good, especially if I'm going to pay.  It's been difficult to find things online that are fast enough to read but still discuss at a more physical level than \"computers were connected\" or \"packets were routed\" or \"TCP/IP was used”.  Statements like that still leave me confused about what's actually happening.  Compare this to wikipedia's article about old [semaphore lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_line), which gave me an intuitive, physical understanding of how the communication worked, even if I don't know the specific symbols used, or the details of how weather affected things.  I think communication over the Internet via metal wire and radio and glass/plastic fiber optics (or other media?) should feel as intuitively understandable from brief reading.  I understand engineering is complicated, but I don't think the basics of just how it works should be all that complicated.\n\nTo further give an idea of what kind of information I'm looking for, these are questions I'd like to be able to answer for myself after learning the basics.  *These are NOT questions I want direct answers to by themselves*.\n\n* What technological changes lead from the telegram and telegraph to the way computers are networked today?  How is the routing/switching system different, and why was it changed?  Why was it changed?  What things still use the old telephone wires, and which things use more recently laid wires, fiber optics, satellites, etc?\n\n* How does the signal I'll send to post this message get from my laptop to reddit to the screen of the person who reads this?  (How does the wireless signal work?  Why doesn't it have interference with all my neighbor's wifi signals?  How does the signal pass through walls?  Are radio waves constantly passing through my body?  What does my modem do?  It's plugged into a special wired connection in the wall with a coax cable, but how does it actually send the signals?  Does it go over phone lines?  Dedicated fiber-optic cables?  Where are the cables?  Does it use satellites at any point?  If someone wanted to tap into the connection, would it be difficult to them to, at various points?  If the communication medium (wire, radio wave, carrier pigeon, etc) is shared with other people sending signals, how does the sharing work, physically?  Also, how does my ISP limit my bandwidth?  Does it recognize and only forward a limited number of requests from my modem per time interval?)\n\n* What is the Internet, exactly?  I read that what makes the Internet, the Internet, is a specific set of protocols, that anyone can participate by using the same protocols to send signals to other entities using the same protocols, over any medium that can carry the signal.  Is that accurate?  What protocols?\n\n* I read what one important aspect of the Internet is its redundancy.  That it's resilient to having parts of the network taken out through hostile attack.  That the removal of nodes won't disrupt communications and remaining nodes will reroute signals through alternate routes.  I also read that packet switching was an important development that lead to this being possible.  What was it like before these innovations?  How were the early computers hooked up, was it over the commercial phone lines?  Were there dedicated wires laid to connect specific machines at specific facilities?  How physically were connections switched (for phone calls too) before packet switching?\n\n* The Internet is supposed to be a network of networks, right, thus the name?  So what are these other separate networks that are supposed to be connected together?  Is that distinction only meaningful historically, or are there still separate networks today, for corporations or governments or something like that?\n\n* Extra: How does net neutrality physically affect all this, and how is it similar or different from other utilities like electricity or communication services like over-wire or cell radio phone service?\n\n* Extra 2: How can I look more directly at some of the signals just out of curiosity? (detect the radio waves that go between my laptop and modem, or between the cell towers and phones; can I connect two computers via ethernet and manually send signals along the wire to manually implement the protocols? If I did, can I detect the signal as it runs along the wire somehow?)\n\nThanks in advance for any help understanding these things.",
