        "text": "Sorry on phone, whatever that means, format, blah blah woof.\n\nOne of the benefits of being a barber for many decades is listening to old guys talk about the good old days. You know when DDT was freely dispursed, PTOs were ripping limbs from farm kids and various war stories. One of the drawbacks is listening to old guys talk. \n\nI'm usually open-minded to all walks of life and find differing opinions are interesting to hear. Unless I'm being fed a regurgitated Fox and Friends or Alex Jones broadcasts being passed off as someone's original thought. I usually just keep repeating \"Is that right\" or \"If you say so\" over and over until they leave. I learned a long time ago some old guys are too set in their ways to bother having any real debate. I learned this from pissing off a lot of old guys.\n\nCue bitchy old guy. BOG had an agenda. He went right past the usual football, weather, how long you been here small talk and it was politics. I got the feeling I had offended one of his coffee club buddies in the past and his real purpose was to bat clean-up (4th at bat to clear the bases). Something was off with his affect and the conversation became very forced/pointed, not organic.\n\nWhile I'm clippering away he states a question \"you would agree that . . .\"  Sorry I can't remember his exact question, but I do know that I didn't agree and said so, as politely as I could. I abhore people putting words in my mouth. When he again started \"well you would agree with . . .(total bullshit)\" the bile began building in the back of my mouth and again sorry I can't remember what he said, but no I didn't agree AT ALL and said so, not so nice this time tone. \n\nBy now I see what's up, he's trying to get me to agree to a pretext of premises that will lead to the grand enlightenment that my simple mind will of course be forced to understand, he's channeling Alex Jones. When he gets to the third example, before he can expect agreement I state \"Why would you think that? That doesn't make any sense\". Strike three and BOG didn't like being derailed, he can't have his aha moment if I don't agree with 1,2 or 3.\n\nIn the span of five minutes BOG has gone from smirky know-it-all to nearly purple, really noticable with white hair. He jumps out of the chair and spins to face me. I've seen that look before and know he's about to throw a punch, but he freezes and batters me with the death stare instead. I ask him if he's done, more death stares, again I ask if he's done, nothing but rage. I tell myself he's done so I reach over his shoulder to undo the cutting cape. He has a phone out, he's been recording the whole time. He does some fumbling with the phone, puts it to his ear and starts talking to 911.  \n\nOMG this constitutes an emergency to BOG. This was new territory, I've seen people use the police to fight their battles before, but this absolutely floored me. I was clueless as to what law I must have broken and I've taken law classes. I was willing to let BOG have his tantrum, leave with half a haircut and tell his coffee club buddies what an asshole I am, it's true I am, but call the cops? \n\nI tell him loud enough for 911 and neighbors to hear to get out of my shop. I helped him out the door at the same time. He sat in his car, with his wife, still on the phone. A few minutes go by and they both get out and are standing in my parking lot, still on the phone. I am getting madder by the minute at this entitled snowflake so I go out to yank his chain, hopefully he'll swing at me. I take out my fancy flip phone and take a close-up photo of him, he tells this to the police, additional charges? I go back inside and wait for the fuzz. \n\nI don't get uni's, I get two detectives at my door, this is serious business. After hearing BOG's complaint they both come inside and ask me what happened, it took me 30 seconds to explain everything. Then I was asked why I took his picture, I said he didn't pay for his haircut.  \"He didn't pay for his haircut?\"\n\"Nope\". (Not really a reason but. . .)\n\nThey both left without saying a word. A minute or so later they return with BOG and make him pay $10 for the haircut. Apparently the *\"customer is always right\"* is not a reason to bother the police after all and they were not happy with him.\n\nTL:DR; I didn't agree with bitchy old guy who thought money in hand meant customer is always right is some kind of law the police would enforce. Instead found out there's law that one has to pay for services rendered. ",

        "text": "#BACKSTORY\nSo basically I lived for 1 year in my old apartment with a roomie, let's call him Blake. Now I tried being friends with Blake but he was fairly distant so I respected that. Overall our roommate dynamic was we really don't try to bother each other. Clean up after yourself obviously and just basic manners. We both weren't the best of roommates as we obviously had tendencies that annoyed each other. But there was a clear difference between Blake and I. If something happened that bothered me, or if I had known I offended/bothered Blake, I'd sit him down and talk it out like grown adults. Now if it was the opposite, Blake would just not say anything and just be a douche and bring it up months later when I confront him about something else. For example, he stopped taking out the trash for an entire month. I confronted him about it and he blew up on me saying I used his dishes and put them back in the cabinet dirty (wtf?), obvious lie since he constantly had people over. Now I know roommate stories have two sides, so that's why I'm being objective, I'm admitting my faults. Twice, I had woken him up late at night 3ish AM over the course of a year due to our walls being very thin. That was my fault, and I felt incredibly bad and apologized profusely the next day.\n\n\n#EVENT AND REVENGE\n\nSo let's get to the what happened and the revenge. Basically it was time to move out and Blake was moving out earlier then me. So he more or less decided to not clean any of the kitchen area which was the only area that was actually dirty, we both cleaned our own bathrooms and bedrooms. Now I'm a nice guy and to an extent overly so for such a roommate, so when I had noticed he completely left and ditched me with the cleaning I said okay, whatever. Now that wouldn't of been a problem, but he actually hadn't even cleaned a SINGLE thing and even LEFT trash all over. He didn't empty his cupboards fully so I had to clean out all of that trash. On top of that he literally left rotting food in the fridge, which I also had to clean. Lastly we split the cupboards evenly and he even damaged the cupboards/walls which I guarantee you he didn't take credit for. So I had to spend multiple hours and money on cleaning supplies, cleaning up all of his mess so our landlords wouldn't charge the fuck out of us. On top of that he even ended up stealing my kitchen wastebasket and claimed it was his. Now if it was just general cleaning I wouldn't of minded, but being forced to clean up his trash, rotting food in the fridge, and everything else left me pissed off. (Mind you he lived for 2 years in the apartment and I only lived there for one, he never cleaned the fridge EVER)\n\n\n\nSo I said okay, let's see how you like this. The utilities were still in his name so before I left I set the AC on 70 degrees. About a week ago he texts me asking for me to pay half and said that we'd be good once I paid him. So I responded sure! Just pay me for the cleaning fees and the multiple hours I spent which should also be half. He got fairly angry and the basis of his argument was, he didn't like me as a roommate therefore me spending hours cleaning up his mess means nothing and I should pay half the utility. I went ahead and blocked him on all social media and my phone. We do live in the same area so I imagine we'll run into each other, but I honestly don't care. He's not getting a dime from me after ditching me with that cleaning.\n\n\nEDIT: [Text provided](https://imgur.com/a/RCY5ctv) I already blocked him but I imagine he'll eventually just call me on a different phone number.\n\nEDIT: EMAIL UPDATE [THREAD](https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/9dee61/ditch_all_apartment_cleaning_during_moveout_update/)",

        "text": "So the hubs and I went to see a movie tonight. Being a Tuesday night the theater was mostly empty. We got those perfect seats smack in the center and applauded ourselves that we were alone in the theater. A few more people filtered in but sat away from us. Except for this one guy. There were empty rows all around us but he choose to sit three seats away from us. A small irritation but we didn't mind, at first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly after the movie started the guy decides to leave the theater for whatever reason. Instead of going to the left down the aisle where there were no other people, he went right which meant me and the hubs had to jerk our legs up. And when he came back he did the same thing. He did this three more times before the movie was even half in, each time going in front of us instead of taking the unimpeded path next to him. The exit wasn't any closer, he was just being an inconsiderate prick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the forth time he did it we decided to get revenge. When we go to the movies, like most good people, we stop at the store and buy our candy before hand to avoid those theater prices. Some of our favorites are Milk Duds, Skittles, and Bit-O-Honey. Having been in the heat outside as we shared a smoke before the movie, and in my hot purse, our candy was a little mushy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe spread a wave of these treats on the floor in the aisle beside us and waited. When he came back he walked in front of us again. But we heard the tell-tell squish as he walked over Duds and Skittles and Bits. The funny thing is, he didn't even notice. He stepped over us and took his seat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband used his phone's lock screen light to clean up the remainder of the mess so the theater people didn't have to\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the lights came on he stood and looked down at his shoes because he was stuck to the floor. He let out a stream of curses. We could hear him behind us as we left the theater, \"squish, squish, squish.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe probably didn't learn anything or even realize we had anything to do with it, but we got a good laugh out of it.",

The two two people on my side went forward so it was my turn to go. I was making a left turn.\n\nThis particular intersection is weird because it has 3 lanes on one road, 2 on 2 others, and 5 on the one opposite of the 3 lane. I was in a 2 lane turning left, and the offender was in the farthest right lane on my right (3 lane road).\n\nAs I was turning left, the offender decided that a rolling stop was good enough since the car next to her just left. I honked at her to let her know that she was in the wrong and I was kinda pissed that she went while I was turning.\n\nWow. Bad idea. She thought I was out to get her with that honk.\n\nI turned right into the middle of 3 lanes on the 5 lane road. I had to get into the right lane to turn right and there was space in front of offender. I turn on my blinker and speed up a bit to get in front of her and she speeds up as well!! I end up getting in front of her and she goes livid. She starts pointing at her dash cam and yelling at me (at one point her passenger sticks his head out the car to yell at me?! Idk), I think she may have called the cops or someone on me even.\n\nAnyway, I was in the right turn lane and it was a red light. The opposite lane had a green left arrow, so they were all turning left. I was at the front of this red light and I was already furious. So what else can I do? I sit at wait at that red light until it turns green.\n\nYeah people were behind her and she kept turning around to look at them, but every time I glanced in my rear view mirror at her, she was yelling at me to go. \n\nI was just keeping myself calm and safe.

        "text": "Long time reader, first time poster. My brother got me into reading these stories and now I've finally got one of my own!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the other day I was at a local store looking to buy some of my favorite perfume. I won't name it because this is about what happened and not the perfume itself. I found a small bottle of what I'm looking for but don't grab it yet, as I am busy glancing through others to see if I can locate a larger one. I hear the sound of heels clacking on the floor near me and shortly afterward an odd grunt. I look up and see a rather round and IMO ugly middle aged looking woman glaring at me as if I had just killed her new puppy. \n\n&gt;You're in my way. \n\nShe chortles while making a backward waving motion with one hand. I step aside a bit without even thinking about it and she starts looking at the perfumes while standing about one foot from me, which is too close for my taste. Then she looks at me again and asks:\n\n&gt;What is that AWFUL SMELL?\n\nNow I'm confused because there is the vague scent of a lot of perfumes, probably because other customers had test sprayed them, but none are what I'd call \"awful\". I shrug and begin to move away from this horrid beast when I hear her say:\n\n&gt;Now it's getting better! Wait, you, come back here!\n\nI've been walking away this whole time, content to come back later when middle-aged medusa has left the premises, but alas her cranky loud siren song tempted me to stop and look back and be turned to stone...well, sort of. She waddles over to where I am near the end of the row.\n\n&gt;Yes! You're the source of that AWFUL SMELL! Tell me what you're wearing! I want to make sure not to buy that!\n\nI'm caught between being mortified and being angry. This is my absolute favorite perfume and has been for years. I understand not everyone likes the same things, but to come right out and insult it like that is uncalled for IMO. After a moment the anger wins out and I decide I'm going to make her pay for this in my own special way. I lead her to the area we were just in and point to a different type of perfume which is an arm's length or so away behind her and slightly lower than her paw can reach while standing up.  As I'd hoped she turns and leans down to get a better look. While she does so, I took a spray bottle of my \"awful smell\" favorite perfume and quickly unleashed several pumps of the scent into/onto her purse. When she turned around I \"hid\" what I'd done by spraying myself with it.\n\n&gt;Oh, never mind, this is it! This is the one you don't like!\n\nI say as if I had just discovered it. She grunts and begins dramatically coughing as if the mere scent I've now sprayed is about to kill her. Keep in mind I'd been wearing this perfume the whole time and she never coughed yet, so I don't think she really had an allergy or anything. She waddles off faster than I thought she could go. Yet thanks to my petty revenge, as my title says, the \"awful smell\" was then \"following\" her around. \n\nTL;DR - Middle-aged medusa insults my favorite perfume. I make sure it lingers around her like a bad fart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

One day a sheriffs cruiser comes in, monthly check, pretty routine in the county. This check is not for inspection purposes, but more so that the county makes sure the vehicles are road worthy and not a hazard, and if something needs to be changed, change it. Now my dad already has a few vehicles in the bay,   so the  cruiser wasn't about to be checked right away. Few hours go by and the office gets a call. My dads boss received the call, it was the officer  who dropped the cruiser off. She demanded that that car be finished by  the end of his shift, to basically jump to the head of the line of the county vehicles and do hers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n​Now my dad and his boss aren't idiots, they know exactly why she wanted this vehicle passed now. It is no secret that most of these workers with designated county vehicles, take these vehicles home (which is allowed) but actually run all their errands in these vehicles (not allowed). My dad really likes to mess with people that give him a hard time, so he did just that. End of the shift for the officer comes, and she goes to the county garage. Sees her vehicle on the lift, doesn't   care what the inspection says, told my dad they will have to inspect it another day but she is taking that car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n​My dad in his calm voice, turns and points to the car.\n\n​\"The vehicle, is not getting off that lift, today, or tomorrow, or for the next two weeks. It has failed multiple safety violations, it is a danger  to the public, the parts have been ordered but they are back ordered, you will have to be assigned a different cruiser, but until then, that vehicle stays exactly where its at.\"\n\n(nothing was on back order, and nothing was really wrong with the car)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOfficer: \"Well how am i supposed to get home, i drove that to work.\"\n\nDad: \"Dunno, I'd call someone if i were you.\"\n\n​\n\nAnd that's exactly what she did, my dad watched through the bay windows as she had gotten picked up. Enjoy not having your own cruiser to use and having to return the borrowed one everyday until yours is \"fixed\".",

        "text": "This story happened about a year ago. I was riding the school bus like i always do going back home. 2 of my friends (boy and girl) were riding the same bus since they live close to me, so it was always a fun ride.\n\nOne day we hop off at our stop and this drunk guy (and not really sane btw) just kind of walks torwards us but he can't really walk since he was drunk, and it was like 4PM. We didn't think much of it. When he got close he just pushed my guy friend really hard, but he was strong so he didn't move a lot. I couldn't say the same for the girl though. He pushed her so hard she slammed on the ground and her backpack dropped. Also i didn't mention it was a rainy day.\n\nThen it was my turn, he lunged forward at me and tried to push me. I'm kind of fast since i'm short and kinda just backed up and put my leg in front of him. He tripped onto a puddle of mirky water and just layed there for a moment as he couldn't get up. I helped my girl friend up and fast walk out of there before he goes up and becomes aggressive, but we laughed our ass off that day, and the revenge felt good.\n\nTL;DR: a drunk and mentally ill guy tried to push my friends and I for no reason, tripped him onto a bigass puddle ",

        "text": "So this happened like 4-5 years ago during my first year of university. \n\nMe and a guy  I had recently become friends with (lets call him \"Z\") were going to a birthday party for one of our mutual friends from high school. First of all, this was the first time me and Z were drinking together and I had heard that he could get a bit crazy. Anyways, before the party me and Z decided to hang out in his apartment and have a few drinks and we're both in a good mood listening to music while I'm also checking out Z and his moms' apartment. While doing this I notice a nice looking box of chocolates that look like they are quite expensive but since I'm uncomfortable begging for stuff, even from friends, I don't mention it (this will come into play later).   \n\nSkipping ahead a little we went to the party for a few hours and had a really good time socializing and drinking until it was time for the party to head into town to hit the local bars. So we go there and it was at this point that Z was starting to get pretty damn drunk - he couldn't walk straigth, couldn't talk properly and as it turned out he was a pretty mean drunk to the point of shoving me aggressively and insulting random people on the street. As you might figure out, I wasn't really having such a good time anymore at this point. But since I was going to crash at his apartment I basically had to babysit him for the rest of the evening to make sure he didn't start any more random shit with people. \n\nLater when most people decide to call it a night me and Z start walking towards his apartment and at this point Z is just wasted. His place was only a couple of blocks away but on the way there there were two instances where I literally had to drag him up from the streets so that he wouldn't pass out right then and there, all the while insulting me. Finally I manage to drag him to his apartment and the second he walked through his doorway he fell to the floor and immediately fell asleep. \n\nAt this point my feelings were a mix of being pissed off and surprised that he turned out to be such an asshole drunk, like a totally different person from the cool laid back guy I knew from school. It's now around 4 in the morning, I'm still tipsy and figured since I probably couldn't fall asleep for a while I would keep an eye on Z to make sure he was all right but he seemed fine considering everything. At that moment I also realized that I had the munchies. This is the point of my revenge. The big box of your moms fancy chocolate that was in the living room? **Gone. Mine.** And all the wrappers and other evidence? Neatly placed around the body of my snoring friend Z in a manner that looked like he had just ate it all there on the floor.\n\nAfter my delicious feast and genius scheme I was in a better mood so I decided to go to sleep. The next day when I woke up the mess I had created was all cleaned up and a very tired looking Z greeted me. He apologized for the way he acted the night before and that there were parts that he definitely didn't remember. I said there were no hard feelings but that was the first and only time we went out drinking together (mostly because of our lives going in different places at that point with university and all). But he never mentioned a word about this chocolate and to this day I still get a chuckle out of it every now and then thinking about what his reaction was when he woke up on the floor with chocolate wrappers strewn all around him. \n\n**TLDR:** Went to a party with a new friend. Friend ends up being a really mean drunk. Back at friends apartment I then eat all of his moms fancy chocolates and plant the evidence all around his passed out, snoring body. He never mentioned anything about it.",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I went camping over the weekend. We had gone one other time and he got absolutely trashed. He drank way too much beer and stood up from a chair and fell over because he drank too much. He was passed out by 7:30PM. This time he went over to a campsite and partied with people instead of hanging with me (he knows I’m not a big drinker and am not big on crowds - he is the exact opposite. Loves to drink and makes ‘friends’ with everyone). So I just went to bed around 7:30PM.\n\nHe came over and woke me up around 10PM with a lady from the other campsite who said she would put her boobs in my face if I didn’t get up and they dragged me out of the tent over to the group of people. I hung out for about 20 minutes and went back to my tent. The whole day my boyfriend was hanging with them previously he kept making rude remarks about me to them, complete strangers, and throwing me under the bus. So I was pretty done with his company at that point and just went to be by myself.\n\nMy boyfriend came stumbling over a little later back to our tent and laid down. I tried to roll him so I could get him covered in blankets since he laid on top of them and it was chilly at night. Then I decided it wasn’t worth fighting and left him alone. So he froze his ass off all night until he woke up around 6AM to pee. Take that.",

He was always trying to tease or scare me or punch me and nothing ever happened to him. If I tried to retaliate or fight back he just seemed to hit me more. I was about eight years old and he was 10. This time I was furious and couldn’t forget about the latest injustice and decided to once and for all retaliate. \nSo...\nIt was about 1am and l snuck into my parents room and got one of my father’s huge heavy wingtip leather shoes, I then proceeded to sneak into my mean brother’s room. He was sleeping so soundly. I started beating him about the head and face as hard as I could holding the toe of the shoe.  He was getting it from the weighty heel. \nHe woke up screaming and crying and was confused about what was happening. \nMy Father runs in with a baseball bat and sees me standing over him with the shoe in my hand.\nNow he was confused as well. I said “ sorry dad but I had to do it!” He was still unsure what I was talking about and said “okay, okay , now go back to bed”. My brother never got me back and my father never brought it up again. Maybe he thought he was dreaming??\n",

We were finally nearing the front of the line, taking turns holding a sleeping 5 year old child. This was no small feat. It was close to dawn and we were weary of the long hours of waiting. Seemed like 3-4 hours. \n\nSome middle age French guy who came in a jet hours after mine was just deciding he’d cut in line. He walks up and sidles into the line a few people ahead of me. Well, I called him out yelling, “ hey you, I’ve been in the line for hours and I’ll be damned if I let you get in front of me, get back there where you came from!” He got all hostile but walked back towards the back of the line all the while giving me a shocked and angry face. \n\nAfter he left the whole line gave me a round of applause and thanked me. Gee what a bunch of sheep! Left it to me to right this wrong.\n\nAs we finally got out of that building my young son woke up and saw the sun coming up and asked, were we in line all night.

Even though I was only picking up a couple of items and planned on using a small hand basket, I grabbed a cart just to push it in, because why not.  I even stacked on a second one before I got to the front door.  Thats where I encountered jerkface.  We reach the door at the same time, he swings it open and walks in, letting it slam behind him.  So much for common courtesy.  \n\nThe carts inside the building are stored in a little cubby behind a row of shelves to the left of the entrance.  Its two carts wide, but about thirty feet deep.  As i mentioned, a majority of the carts are in the parking lot.  Well, jerkface had to walk almost all the way to the back of the cubby to get his cart. As he was backing out, I wedged the two that i had in at an angle, neatly blocking him in, and let him catch my glare for a moment before I turned to shop.\n\nIcing on the cake,  jerkface wasn't shopping for much either.  As i was headed to the check out, i spotted him walking up as well.  I paced it so I stepped right in front of him as we both reached the register.",

And lastly before I begin, I know I tend to ramble but I'm going to keep this as brief as possible. But if anyone needs elaboration I'll give what I can.\n\n  \n\nSo anyway we had this receptionist in a different department than mine, named L.  Anyway, L was super lazy. So the manager and the department head decided to can her. But since she worked reception they asked S to fill in that spot and explained to him she was getting fired.  \n\n  \n\nImportant note: S *hated* L because he thought she was rude. So when a bunch of other people in the department started asking where L was S said that she was being promoted. \n\n  \n\nThis had the effect that S was hoping it would where in everybody waited in front of her desk to applaud and congratulate her.  \n\n  \n\nBut it also had an unintended effect.   The crowd of people slowed her down from getting to her desk and ultimately her phone...which she was trying to get to so she could erase photos from.  Yup.  That's right, her phone was work issued. And she was desperate to get rid of all the \"bad\" photos on it, especially because she was apparently screwing two coworkers and one of our vendors and the phone had evidence of all off it. And we only dou d out about that because she got delayed just enough by the people crowding in front of her desk.\n\n  \n\nSo in conclusion. S got some very petty revenge and in the process completely accidentally caused L's embarrassing secret sex life to come out. ",

Fair's fair, right?\n\nAfter we were done, I came back to see with some disappointment that the car was still there. I was buckling my kids in when I felt the pressure building up down below. I looked around to see if anyone was near, and I noticed that the failmobile next to me had a window open - right behind me as I was bent over.\n\nAn idea quickly formed. The desire to see through some form of vengeance on my parking-challenged neighbor swelled along with the imperative in my colon. With another, more careful inspection of the surrounding lot, I stepped up to the deck of my minivan and hung on to either side of the sliding door as I stuck my ass right up to the open window and let rip.\n\nThe combination of exertion and paranoia at being caught cut my salvo short, but I didn't dare try for more. My farts can kill small animals and are outlawed in twenty states, so I wasn't worried about quantity over quality. I jumped down and took one more quick look around to make sure my tuba impression didn't draw any attention.\n\nI left with the satisfaction of imagining that when the owners returned, there'd be enough of that chemical warfare baked in the sun heat in their car to make their nostrils curl just a little bit.\n\nTLDR: Someone parked all fucked up, so I blocked them then put my shit-air in their car in the sun",

        "text": "I have season tickets for my home soccer team that I share with my husband, girlfriend, and another couple. Our stadium is known for its fans and noise, and we generally stand the entire game. Well yesterday the game had been going for about ten minutes when my girlfriend gets tapped on the shoulder and asked to sit down because the woman behind us couldn’t see. 95% of the stadium was standing, including everyone around and behind them (she had a male friend who she was making talk to us). My girlfriend was kind of taken aback but sat down anyway, I stayed standing because I wasn’t in their way. \n\nLater in the game we’d moved seats due to beer/snack fetching so now I was in front of this woman and her friend. He asks her why she’s on her phone and she starts bitching in the whiniest manner about how she can’t see again. After a couple minutes, he taps my shoulder in the middle of a play to ask me to sit down so his friend could see. I laughed and shook my head, and told her if she wanted to sit she should have stayed on her couch. She got very condescending towards me, so I told her that I would happily switch seats with her, as we have other friends who are season ticket holders that were right next to her. She told me she “wasn’t trying to be difficult, couldn’t I just sit down”. I told her we were season ticket holders and we stand every game, and I pointed out that everyone around her was standing and cheering. We went back and forth a few more times, she was super snotty and I’m not really great with confrontation (the fact I’d stood up to her to begin with was unusual) so finally I just sat down for a minute because I was getting a little amped up and didn’t want to accidentally swear at her or something, since I was trying to stay somewhat civil despite my irritation with her. \n\nAnother five or so minutes go by and I get tapped on the shoulder again, even though I’m still sitting at this point, and she says “sweetheart, we’re just going to move down there so you can stand”. \n\nLet me tell you. That was not the nice kind of “sweetheart”. This was a “bless your heart” condescending AF sweetheart. And that really pissed me off, because I and another person had already offered to switch with them, so I knew that now she was just trying to make me look bad. I told her that she was in fact just being difficult and to stop talking to me because I didn’t care anymore. At this point the game was really heating up anyway so I stood back up along with the rest of my row, including my husband who had heard this whole saga. He put his arm around me and kissed me and told me he was proud of me for the way I handled her. I could hear her bitching again though, and I realized she really couldn’t see now because we were forming a two person wall. We pulled our girlfriend into the hug too and stayed that way for the remaining 15 minutes of the game, happily cuddled up and making sure the wet blanket behind us couldn’t see anything. \n\nShe stayed stubbornly sitting the whole time. Even when the rest of her friends stood up, she just sat there and pouted. We won the match and I’m assuming we’ll never see her again since she wasn’t the normal season ticket older. Good riddance.

        "text": "First time poster, long time lurker. I don't really know if this is petty or pro, but I was leaning mostly towards petty.\n\nBear with me, English is my third language and I am not really the big story teller, but thought this was pretty funny, so I wanted to share. Sorry if it is a bit long.\n\nFor a long time our neighbor have had a grudge on me and my family. I later found out it was because we didn't greet him every time we walked past him on the sidewalk.\n\nHe is an older man with a sick wife, so he has a 'bucket' on the second story to pee in at night, so they don't have to walk all the way downstairs.\n\nAfter he got a grudge on us he started emptying this bucket in our garden and terrace, sometimes he would pour it under our gate, other times it would just be thrown over the gate and get on all the furniture. I found out about this one night I got home late and there was a big puddle all over the entrance of the garden and terrace, which I thought was weird because it was summer and it hadn't rained in a week or so.\n\nThis went on for another month or so, where our neighbor would do this a couple times every week.\n\nWell, I finished the class I took extra this summer and finally had some vacation, so I didn't have to get up early in the morning for a while. So I thought I would be sitting on the terrace just chilling, reading a book or something.\n\nThen came the day I was hoping for, I heard his clogs walk across the street and I looked through the small cracks in the fence, and lo and behold, it was that neighbor with a bucket in his hands.\n\nSo I was just about to yell, when I thought I would try something out. So I waited for him to get ready to throw the pee over the fence. As soon as he started making the throwing motion, I started yelling at him, and what I hoped for, happened. He got such a shock that he accidentally threw the pee straight up into the air, splashing it all over himself. He quickly ran back to his house, and I walked in to call the police, because now we finally have a witness of what he has been doing for such a long time. They came and talked to him, I don't know what they said to him, all I know is that he hasn't done anything to us since, he even greets us now, when we walk past him.\n\nTL:DR; Neighbor throws pee over our fence and on to our terrace, I waited for him and yelled out really loudly the second he started the throwing motion, ended up covered in his own pee.",

I needed the job, 25 years ago sexual harassment was a long and expensive experience. And I liked the job, I really like kids and I got this dimwit to begin ordering educational toys, well made and had some seriously wealthy families who liked I cared about the kids. The perks were really awesome in regards to tips. \n\nAlso shoppers at the store were the many poorly paid domestic workers who worked for these wealthy people. Quite often sent in to buy junior a ‘treat’ that equaled hers and my daily wages out together. I got to known them well. This one really sweet girl worked for this dragon lady. Mean, treated the help like the help. Her kids were vile spawn. Her kid wiped his chocolate cover hand down the front of a $300 teddy and she laughed.

He really wanted one. No way she could afford it. \n\nBoth our bosses were assholes. And I was feeling festive. \n\nI bagged up a game boy, games and anything else that went with it. Overcharged her boss’ account by $300 and gave her the cash to help pay her son’s school fees. \n\nNo guilt. ",

Grandma once mentioned a doll in her room she thinks was haunted. Shit was creepy and would turn and blink and talk kind of motion sensored. She let slip that she pulled the batteries out. So the next day i put them back in. She usually spent all her time out of her room and would only go back until night time. So she didnt notice until she was goin to bed and the doll started turning and talking. I figured she said NOPE! Because she spent the night on the couch lol so in the am i turned the doll off and she went in but didnt even bother with the doll as now she thinks that thing is possessed. I did this for about a year. She didnt sleep on the couch after that first time but at night she would cover the doll with a blanket. Phase 2 happened when she got a new tv for christmas. She wanted me help programming it. Well as i was digging through the menus i see one called Wakeup time. And it gave me an idea. So i set the time up for 3 am every other day. First night...bam tv turns on blaring causing the doll to start responding too. My grandma came flying out of her room. Once the tv turned off and everything settled she was back in bed. This shit happened every other fucking night for 3 years... i eventually told grandma and she laughed her ass off.",

        "text": "Td;lr My brother rudely threw something at me when I asked for it. He needed a ride to a football game where all his friends were and I denied it because of his behavior. He spent the night desperately looking for a ride and failed. Big win. \n\nHonestly I dont get too many victories with this brat because I can be a pushover but this felt good.\n\nSo yesterday my brother has an appointment to get a haircut and I'm his ride. He takes our mom's debt card to pay for it and I leave him there for later to get picked up. Time passes and he is ready to get picked up. Befote I go, I ask mom if its cool to use the same card my brother had to get food. She says yes and I go.\n\nI pick him up and ask him how much of a rush he was in to get back home, because he mentioned a football game at his school he wanted to get ready for, and if stopping at a drive thru fit in his schedule. He says no and to take him straight home. Honestly was a bit mad because it would have taken like 10 min at the most. But whatever, the place I wanted to get from was a 2 second drive from our house, it was the lack of consideration I was mad but fine, Im not starting a fight over this. And we said nothing the rest of the ride.\n\nWe get back to the house and he is leaving the car already, still with the debt card. I remind him to hand it to me and he says, \"Did you ask mom?\"\n\nOk first off, I identify as the good child. I get permission and respect my parents rules for the most part. He tries to leave the house at 11 at night at 15 yrs old, has people over without permission, and other shit he shouldnt be doing when theyre not home.\n\nBut yes, I did ask.\n\nHe steps out of the car, impatiently digs through his pocket, takes out the card, and I already knew just from his demeanor what was coming, throws it at me without a second thought. And walked back inside. I'm pissed. So naturally as he is walking, I honk my horn to get his attention to flip him off for it. And he turns, with a smile. Squinted eyes. And clapping. Applauding me for finally growing a pair and using the horn for the first time he witnessed.\n\nI go get my shit, but I'm pissed the whole time and I felt like a line was crossed. \"Fuck it,\" I tell  myself, \"Now if he needs a ride, I aint gonna be there for him.\"\n\nAnd what do you know.\n\nI'm hanging around and next thing you know, he calls my name. I come by and he's all dressed for night of fun with his friends. He asks me for a ride.\n\nNo.\n\nI calmly tell him no. No yelling. No cursing. Just a simple, \"I'm mad at you, and I dont feel the need to drive you. Sorry but you'll have to find another ride.\" \n\nWhich he didnt.\n\nAll of his friends were already at the game, and almost all of them are too young to drive anyway. He was desperate. He spent the night sulking and begging others for a ride. Eventually he tried to convince my mom to let him take an uber there. Didnt work.\n\nNight passes a bit and I'm in my room and he comes in, and apologizes for he did. I was pretty sure our mom told him to do it. But you know what, apologizing is hard and maybe he learned something for the future. I tell him I forgive him for it. \n\nBullshit. After he left my room, he comes peeking his head again like 3 min later with, \"Can you take me to the game?\" \n\nAgain, no. He goes to his room and starts hitting his bed out of frustration. When our mom asked what was wrong, he said he dropped something.\n\nAnd he asked three more times after that.\n\nApparently, there was still hope for him to catch the game cause there was a rain delay. And the whole time I didnt budge.\n\nSo he spent the whole night pissed off and desperate to get there somehow. Mind you, this a rare occurence for him. Like 1 in 100 he doesnt get to go out when he wants, and he goes out a lot.\n\nAnd our parents were on my side the whole time. My mom didnt even know about the card incident. She thought I was denying him a ride because of how he asked me to take him to his appointment. Which was very rude. He didnt even ask. He walked up to me and basically just told me that had an appointment he needed to get to for his hair. Pretty much implying he already had it set in place and not even asking if I had plans during that time(didnt but still.) The best part is he didn't actually set the appointment yet, he was just bad enough at communicating to leave me enough strands to assume he did. \n\nSo when parents found out about the actual reason they had no issue backing me up. The worst I felt out of it was when I realized it was actually stressing out my mom. She knows my brother is generally an asshat to but it was still her son. She didnt like seeing him upset even if she admits it was necessary and his fault for his behavior.\n\nSo yeah, I essentially had my first victory over my entitled brat of a brother, and I intend to have more if he doesnt want to learn.\n\nAnd the best/worst part, he probably wont.\n\nEdit: Added detail(s?) thingy.

        "text": "I work Chinese food delivery and I can tell you many stories dealing with completely entitled customers that MUST GET THEIR FOOD AT THIS TIME OR ELSE. People get so rude when they're hungry!\n\nOf course we do get customers that just don't tip. Most of the time I don't mind because it just happens too often to get mad about. The only time I get annoyed is when an order is really far away. This is because when I take an order over 5 miles away, sometimes I have to pass up the other orders. So not only are you not giving me a tip, but having to take yours means I've potentially lost 3 close deliveries and I could have gotten 3 different tips.\n\nSo I get my order and it's more than 5 miles away, I know exactly where this house is. I've delivered here before and they're starting to become regulars, always ordering during our rush, never tipping. Once we forgot an egg roll with their order, and they called the restaurant upset beyond what you'd expect for something so small. They also check off another delivery pet peeve, and that's taking forever to come to the door. It's smack in the middle of Friday dinner rush, I have other deliveries waiting and I cannot wait for you to take 10minutes to come to the door! Last time I delivered I knocked, rang the door bell, and even called they're phone number, no answer. I was about to head back to the restaurant when they finally came out. Frankly, they're just terrible people and customers. No respect for my time, no tip, and I am actually losing money and wasting gas delivering to your far house. (Not to mention there are 2 other Chinese places that deliver to the house way closer). So here comes my revenge. \n\nI would never steal a tip, spit in someone's food, the usual waitress/delivery revenge, that stuff doesn't sit well with me. So I was trying to figure out something small I could do. I noticed that their whole order is fried food, and this stuff usually goes with sweet and sour sauce. They ordered so much fried stuff there were 2 tubs of the sweet and sour sauce in the bag. Welp, I tossed one tub in the garbage. But 1 tub is still too much for these no-tippers, so I dump half of the other tub out. It would look suspicious if they received half a tub full, so I diluted the rest of the sauce with water. \nJust imagine they're getting ready to eat their sweet and sour chicken, dipping that delicious golden nugget into watery tastless sauce... Enjoy your dry fried food. \n",

Sometimes she'd tell me to do her chores, and I did them or else they wouldn't get done. (And if they didn't get done my mom would be pissed)\n\nWell one day she did something so awful. She left out my Bratz dolls in the living room and I got in shit for it, so I had to clean them up on top of punishment chores. My mom didn't care about petty childhood politics, so she didn't care when I said it wasn't my mess.\n\nI was so mad. I only know one other time I got this mad (again, by the hands of my sister. But that's a different story) I was furious. Seeing red, as they say. Red sauce. \n\nYou see, I am very teeny tiny. 5'1 and 98 pounds at 20, you can imagine I was even smaller as a child. So I had to resort to indirect justice.\n\nI don't know why I put hot sauce in her bed. Thinking back, it's just a bizzare thing to do. But I was pissed and couldn't just punch her so I just... Grabbed a bottle of franks and poured it everywhere over her sheets and under her pillow. I think I was hoping she wouldn't notice and then get hot sauce in her eyes or something.\n\nWell it turns out she didn't notice, she felt her bed was damp later but the truth was so nuts her brain didn't connect that spicy smell + damp sheets = hot sauce in the bed. \n\nSo, she slept in it. And she was so lazy she didn't do laundry for at least another four days. Sleeping in her hot sauce bed. \n\nI never got in trouble for it, and I didn't tell her until years later.

Well that was the story that inspired this revenge when I was a kid. \n\nI was maybe about 7 or 8 and when my mum decided that I was finally going to sleep without a night light. This, I did not like. I expressed so through the media of tantrum because I was mature. However, when this did not work, I got smart.\nSo, I wasn't going to be able to sleep? Then nor would my mum. After dinner I crept off to my room and grabbed a handful of conkers from my conker collection. My logic here was that if a pea could keep a princess awake then, surely, the conkers would have a similar effect for my mum. Yup, they were the closest I had to a dried pea.\nI shoved about six of them into my mother's pillowcase to be extra sure. Pillowcase; because I couldn't lift the mattress but also because that just seemed more obviously uncomfortable. Then I crept off again like a true mini villain.\n\nBelieve it or not the conkers actually worked. My mum complained about her pillow feeling like rock the next day at breakfast. By then I'd forgotten all about why I was even angry to being with. So, later, I took the conkers out. \nThis went on every time my mum upset me for about half a year before I finally came clean to her. My mum, being the fantastic lady that she is, wasn't even angry when I told her. Instead, she just started laughing when I emptied her pillowcase of conkers to show her.\nThat, ladies and gentlemen, is the tale of how I used conkers as revenge when I was young.\n\nTL;DR: My mum annoyed me, I put conkers in her pillow to stop her from sleeping. It worked. The Princess and The Pea is legit.",

        "text": "For the past five hours, there's been loud stomping in the apartment above us. Loud thuds, obvious party noises. That's cool, I get it. But then a rhythmic stomping starts that's obviously intentional, and it's excessive. \n\nI walk upstairs and knock on the door. In my head I've got my script planned out: \"Hey, I know it's a Friday night, and I don't want to be a buzzkill. But the stomping is getting excessive. Could you please try to watch it?\" \n\nI knock on the door again, louder. Still no response. Music is blasting, so maybe they can't hear me. No worries. I knock again. \n\nI hear someone get up and come lock the door. I say loudly through the door, \"it's just a neighbor, I just want to talk!\" Maybe they think I'm a cop and they're smoking weed or something, idk. \n\nThey walk away. I try knocking again. \n\nAfter about five minutes of this, they shout through the door, \"yeah, there's no way we're ever opening that door!\" They bust out laughing, turn the music up louder, and stomp louder. I can hear them talking shit.\n\nI am fuming right now. I have nothing against parties, we throw some ourselves. But the absolute disrespect and lack of consideration is astounding. I walked back in the apartment absolutely fuming, without getting to say a word. \n\nOn that note, enjoy the new party music folks. Your speakers are Bluetooth and unprotected. Your new playlist consists of Rick Astley, Crazy Frog, and any other immature shit we can think of. Every time you disconnect us, we'll reconnect. We've got all night. ",

They spent the next couple of weeks spying on the tenants, noting where they went during the day and how long they were gone and eventually were ready to put their plan into effect.\n\nWhen both tenants were out of the house they brought in a plumber and family friend to take out both the sink unit and both the toilets in the house.\n\nWhen the host of the show, the soft spoken Joe Duffy asked whether that was legal the woman essentially responded with \"I don't care, it got them out\".\n\nShe was right, two days later they were gone",

The other night I went into work and wanted to work pizza chef but we already had one there so I worked on POS (front) one of my first costumers walks in about 30 minutes after my shift starts, (Thursday’s are a little slow so there’s not much traffic) it was a family of 4, Bitchy mom, quiet husband, chill 11 year old, and a 17 year old who minded their own business. The mom wants to pay for herself and her son, ok that’s whatever families do this all the time. Then she has a coupon for 2 adult buffets for only $20, it’s an ok deal $6 off 2 buffets. I inform BM (hehe) about this and she then adds her quiet husband onto the ticket and tells the daughter to pay for herself. Ok that’s fine I don’t really care. \n\nHere’s where my part comes in. The daughter asked why she had to pay for herself, I thought a really good question, and she replied “Just pay for your fucking self” \n\nMy first thought was don’t talk to your own daughter that way, (not attracted to her am gay) and be a mother and pay for her meal. So I decide to put the adult buffet on and take a few discounts on the daughters meal. Civic appreciation? Yea you’re doing God’s work living with that thing, $1 off buffet? Yep. I go her a nice little sum of like $4/5 on a normal $13 buffet. \n\nDoes it suck that I may have screwed the company over like $10, yea, but the BM (hehe 2.0) didn’t even notice that’s how much she was paying attention. \n\nMoral of the story, don’t be a bad parent. I may give your kids a nice discount. \n\nTL;DR: bad mom made her daughter pay for her own food, made daughters meal less expensive. Don’t be BM\n\nEdit: grammar ",

        "text": "So this happened back when I was in high school. I was a vice captain for my house, and so would regularly schedule events for the lower school (I live in Britain, so we had six year groups in high school) in collaboration with other house captains. I also tended to be the only person to wait until the end of the day on a Tuesday, as I had no classes after lunch, but would wait to go home with my friends.\n\nAnyway, the head boy, deputy head boy, and head girl, have been planning a school dance, to be crossed with Burns' Night, a Scottish tradition. That would be the only thing they did all year, as any previous events they \"planned\" never went through in the end.\n\nSo I'm there alone on a Tuesday afternoon, pretending to be studying in the common room, when a teacher tells me that the gym staff are happy to host the dance again this year, as they do every year, for free and during school times, and to let the Head team know. So I message the year group chat for the first time ever.\n\nHead Boy replies fairly quickly, despite being in class, saying that \"we already have a dance\" and I was to tell the gym staff to cancel their one. I respond that this one would be free and during school hours, as opposed to the Head Boy and Girl's idea of making it a paid event later at night. Deputy Head Boy chimes in and asks me why I want two dances. I say I clearly didn't ask for two dances, I'm suggesting this dance might be more liked due to being FREE. Head Boy starts mocking me for wanting two dances and some of his friends join in, and one of my acquaintances messages me to tell me to stop sending messages, as people are laughing about it in class.\n\nI elect not to tell the gym staff their dance is supposed to be cancelled, deciding the Head Boy can do it himself when he realises I haven't, and head home, afraid to be seen by any of my classmates, and honestly afraid I'll have to deal with torment for the rest of the year.\n\nAs it closes in on the time for the gym staff's dance, they start advertising it. School students looking forward to it because it's free and will get them out of a couple of classes. Head Boy tells the gym staff they'll have to cancel it, as he's already planning a dance. Advertisement goes away. People lose interest. The paid for event is announced, but people now know that a free dance was cancelled, so why bother with one that costs money?\n\nThe time for the Head team's dance event comes and... Nobody goes. Genuinely about three people bought tickets for this event, and because they'd paid for food, staff, a DJ, and to rent the school out for the night, it ended up costing the school money and had to be cancelled.\n\nHead Boy never speaks to me again. I can't say I mind.\n\ntl;dr ended up causing the Head Boy to cancel his only event of the year and caused the school to pay out a lot of money in his name, because he made me look like an idiot",
