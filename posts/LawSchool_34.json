        "author": "rebelraf",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/10an0qn/how_important_is_political_party_when_applying/",
        "text": "Background on me - 3L; A- GPA (100% sure I’m in the top 25% at worst, at last measurement I was in the top 15%, but this was after 1L. I’d guess I’m somewhere in the 15-20% range at this point); diverse experiences with non-profits, governmental entities, and small firms (primary focus criminal defense); law school ranking is meh, in the top 80; judicial interning experience; 1st gen law student; experience working in various capacities in federal and state trial and appellate courts in several states/districts/circuits. \n\nI’m applying for a judicial clerkship at the court of last resort in my home state (I haven’t lived there for the past 6 years but visit frequently &amp; previously lived there for 17 years). When it comes to law I’m *never* too confident, but I actually feel really great about the strength of my cover letter, writing sample, and resume. Good references as well. Wanting to do a professional clerkship is a newfound desire and I worried that because I didn’t necessarily set out at the beginning of law school with this as a career goal, that I would be behind. But based on experience, ties to the state, and quality of application materials, if there’s any judicial clerkship I have a decent shot at getting, it’s probably this one. \n\nThere’s just one thing — the judge for whom I am applying to work is strongly opposite of me in almost, if not all, political respects. We are registered in opposite parties. Based on social media activism, the fact that I am openly lesbian and genderqueer, and my passion for criminal defense it is very visible, obvious, and readily apparent. I am currently interning for a state appellate court judge in a different state, and he is also the opposite party from me. This has not been an issue at ALL in my work and did not appear to impact his hiring decision either. \n\nIn theory, the judiciary branch is not about political opinions and parties, but I think it’s fair to say they can often (though shouldn’t) be influential. I’m interested in this particular judge for their work background and because I have never worked in/for a court of last resort! The political party difference doesn’t seem important to me. BUT, as a judicial clerk I recognize that understanding and writing from the perspective of the judge *is* the job. My friend and classmate (whose legal opinion I trust a lot) commented that odds are weighed heavily against me just for my political stances. I’m not sure how true that is, or if it is as relevant for state supreme courts as it is for federal courts.  \n\nTl;dr - How much does political party or ideology generally weigh into a state supreme court judge’s decision to hire (or not hire) someone as a law clerk? If I were a strong contender in all other respects, do you think it would be a reason to count me out? \n\nApplying either way and hoping for the job eagerly either way, but would still like a dose of realism. \n\nThanks!",

When the network restarted and i regained connectivity a minute later, all the questions i had chose had disappeared and i had to re-enter all my answers. Since i had spent over an hour on it, i knew what my answers already were so i rushed thru each question and quickly input my answers. I didn’t report this because I didn’t think this was an error and because i was able to submit my answers anyway. \n\nA few weeks later, the ethics committee reached out to me to let me know that they think i had used model answers from some other teacher who teachers an entirely different class but includes some of the subjects we were covering. I deny this allegation. But the committee can’t wrap their head around how i was able to answer 25 questions in 1 minute &amp; 57 seconds correctly. \n\nI explained what happened with the glitch but they are overlooking whatever i am trying to explain to them and instead giving me an informal resolution to either accept a violation of the honor code for misconduct during a test (and this was an assignment, not a test) or go before a 3 person panel, in which if i lose, i will also face a second violation for lying/false statements because i signed a document in which i pledged not to violate the honor code during the semester. \n\nThis is going to ruin my whole career &amp; i’m a 3L who is in his last semester at school and was getting ready to submit his moral character application next month.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.

As someone who's had public interest field experience before law school and last summer, and am rotating to BL this summer, I really want to encourage you not to close the PI door. There are several reasons to at least look into PI jobs if applicable to your field of interest (or even if not) - and one I wanted to specifically discuss is the fact that **while they may be** (often, at least) **unpaid, your school likely has a Public Interest student organization that offers grants to students doing PI work.** \n\nI say this from my own school experience and that of people I know at other schools that it is at the very least worth looking into. I don't want to share too much about my own experience, but last year, it was a really easy application process and I received a great amount that helped me pay off some bills and live for the summer. At my school, they did cap it at a certain amount if you also received grants from other sources, and, I did incur the obligation to help the org a little this year. Additionally, I know from at least one other school as well that judicial clerkships are exempt. But, again, this is absolutely worth looking into before deciding not to even apply for PI jobs.",

        "text": "I go to a t4 school in New york where merit scholarships are conditional.  This year's spring and fall semester 1l classes agreed to merit scholarships being retained at a 3.15 gpa cutoff on a 4.3 grade scale.  Under the student handbook that we received for this particular grade scale-- it is stated that all 1l classes are curved to between a 2.9 and a 3.1.  Legal process is not curved.  \nNow, this is the part that gets interesting, and I want to understand how egregious or not egregious the following events are. \nAs the new fall semester of 2022 starts a new student handbook is issued as is every year.   There was no communication to the students through email that a significant change in the grade curve was made.  However, it was discoverable in the new student handbook that the 4.3 scale would be changed to a 4.0 scale and all 1l classes would be curved to a 2.6-2.9.   When students become aware of this change they offered no answer as to how it would affect merit scholarship outcomes. Only two days ago, as grades are being posted for the fall semester, did an administrator write an email saying that merit scholarships will be retained by having a 3.15 or above or by being in the top 40 percent of the class.   The administrator is refusing to provide any evidence that a 3.15 was a marker for the 40th percentile.  \nSo there is no way to know if there is a discrepancy that would cause students to lose out on scholarships.   The lack of communication on this issue makes me suspicious, but perhaps it was just incompetence.  I suppose I want to know how unusual this is and what my options are.  Thanks!",

What differences have you noticed in your comprehension of class discussions, if any? \n\nI am a consistent laptop note taker because I can get down way more information and can trim it down later. I know that a lot of studies say that this approach harms class engagement because it amounts to transcribing what the professor says, but that’s not been my experience at all. I feel like I’m perfectly engaged and can later trim down what’s necessary while outlining. With that being said, I am open to trying hand written notes.",

The judge is in one of the major US cities.\n\nTo be honest, I never considered this option but I just received an offer. Is this experience something that would bolster a resume over other options? Even if I don't necessarily want to work in criminal defense or prosecution? I have a relatively weak GPA (2.8) so I think this would be an extremely strong opportunity for me.\n\nI would appreciate any thoughts on this. Thanks!!!",
