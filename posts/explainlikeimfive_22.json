Heck, I've been very happily married for roughly 15 years now, and I certainly wouldn't feel qualified to call myself a \"marriage coach\", even though statistically speaking, happily staying together 15 years is GREAT.\n\nSo when I see 20-to-30-year-olds here and there calling themselves life coaches, I'm completely baffled as to...how? Like, is this a Tony-Robbins, self-help-speaker sort of thing where someone projects assertiveness until people think they're \"an authority\"? Why would a 28-year-old think they have the experiential standing to coach someone else's life? I mean, I've wired a few light switches here and there but I certainly would run a workshop on \"how to be an electrician\", you know? Are these people being waaaaay over-assertive/confident about their ability to life-coach, or is there something else to it? I'm very confused about this.",

People would send a child to pull on the door as early as 45 minutes before we opened. I’d hear the child yell to their parents that the door is open and they would park and unload a small army and come in expecting to be served. When we would let them know that we open in 40 minutes or so they would look at us thoroughly confused. There was an open sign that was clearly turned off and the hours of operation were posted in plain sight. All of this is ignored if the door is unlocked. Why? Did businesses run like that in the past? Is it like this outside of the United States of America?",
