        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/conservation/comments/4d97b9/degree_in_forestry_for_a_career_in_conservation/",
        "text": "Hello there!  I am currently a sophomore studying geology at a university.  I love geology for all the reasons that first got me into it; learning about evolution, fossils, and karst topography.  However, it's becoming more apparent that most graduates end up as environmental consultants or O&amp;G monkeys.  While some might find the money enticing, I find the lack of purpose... off-putting.\n\nI've considered many degrees throughout my life.  My childhood dreams were wildlife biology/ecology.  I've looked into geography, environmental science, archaeology, psychology, anthropology, and agronomy.  As you can see, I have many passions involving people, land, and sustainability.  \n\nLast semester, I was introduced to forestry as a course of study and immediately fell in love.  This is due to several reasons.  Are these right reasons?  A better question to ask is *are these true*, or am I just falling for propaganda?\n\n* I've heard foresters described as \"swiss army knives\" of conservation because they have a *broad* range of skills and need to work for the benefit of the economy, the community, AND the wildlife.  I'd much prefer a broad \"jack-of-all-trades\" career than the niche-oriented research that academia seems to promise.  \n\n* It's a more people-oriented career.  A significant portion of work (albeit this more or less depends upon the specific career) depends upon working with people concerning both private and public land.  - This is a big for me.  One thing I've learned since starting college is that I'm less smart than I thought *but* my social skills are stronger than I thought.\n\n* Forestry is a nice foundation for advanced careers in permaculture, sustainability, agroforestry, rand management, and ecological restoration.  All of these interest me STRONGLY.\n\n---\n\nIdeally, I'd like to be developing and carrying out plans for land restoration, reclamation, and community use (such as agroforestry or permaculture).  On a broader aspect, I would enjoy anything involving GIS mapping, a sense of community, teaching, networking, and digging/anything physical.  Oh, and writing.  I love writing.  It would be AMAZING if I could, at some point in my career, travel to a remote and/or developing country for work.  I've read about Masters International programs for earning a master's degree while serving in the peace corps.  Of course, that's too far off in the future to worry about now.  But it makes me excited.  \n\nIf things go as planned, I would be switching to forestry and opting for a minor in geology.  This should include LOTS of hydrology, geomorphology, soil science, and GIS.  The degree in forestry would specialize in Natural Resource Conservation and Restoration.  \n\n---\n\nAm I on the right track toward a career in conservation?  A **big** problem for me is that I tend to get starry-eyed and loose a realist's perspective.  That's why I'm hoping for your opinion.  Thank you for reading this far.  Have a wonderful night.",

        "text": "According to the world bank, sustainable development means\n&gt;\"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\"\n\nShifting to sustainable development is a huge leap to jump for developing countries. Mainly in my opinion due to these problems.\n\nCorruption is prevalent in developing countries. Lots of officials take bribes.  Because of this it is difficult to properly implement regulations regarding the environmental impact and human rights. Politicians and officials would often do things that are detrimental to the country in hopes of personal gain. \n\nLack of awareness and interest in sustainable development among majority of the public. In developing countries, a majority of the population lack a standard education. Because of this they don't understand the significance of it. Farmers would use large quantities of harmful pesticides on crops to increase yield. But they would not understand how doing so becomes detrimental to the health of not only the consumers of the crops but even themselves who grow it. Same goes for workers in other industries.\nLack of interest is also another factor. Lot of people in this part of world suffers from poverty. When your chief concern becomes trying to bring food to the table, there is no time to care about the effect on the environment. For example, even if the farmers knew about growing organic crops or using less pesticides, they wouldn't do so because it will reduce their intimidate income. \n\nMultinational corporations outsourcing production plants to developing countries. This itself is not a problem. In fact it is beneficial for developing societies. These corporations create lots of jobs in areas with high unemployment. Problems arise when these corporations pollute the environment in the host countries and sometimes violate human and labor rights of it's workers. This happens again because of corruption and failure to implement regulation in these countries.\n\nTransitioning from the manufacturing and production methods practiced currently to more sustainable methods is expensive. Developing countries don't have the money to consider these. Governments are having a hard time combating disease prevention, poverty and food shortages. Caring about sustainability is a luxury.\n\nAs explained above these are my personal opinions of why it is difficult to promote sustainable development in developing countries, so there might be errors and others factors I didn't consider. I wrote this partially from my personal experience as a citizen of a developing country.\n\nMy question is how to overcome these problems and any other problems I didn't mention in the road towards sustainable development. Lack of it is having a detrimental effect on the health of the citizens of many developing countries. And China having surpassed USA in the total greenhouse gas emissions, it is no longer possible for the developed world to ignore this problem. What is happening in the developing world will not only impact their own countries but the whole world.",

I've currently been accepted into Arizona State, Seattle Pacific, and University of Richmond. Still waiting on USC. My question is, does it really matter what school I go to in terms of academics? Does a degree from one institution look different than one from another in this field? The majors are slightly different; it is cons. biology and ecology at ASU, ecology at SPU, and  environmental studies at UR.\nAny other advice on the topic would be appreciated. Thanks!",

        "text": "Victoria Falls is Zimbabwe’s most popular tourist destination, famous for both the stunning waterfalls and the wildlife found in the area. Wild animals including elephants, baboons and warthogs can be found strolling through the town. However, problems have recently arisen from the close proximity of the town to conservation areas, and may lead to a loss of many of the animals that make the town so special.\n\n[The town rubbish dump](http://i.imgur.com/DmygJPd.jpg) is currently unfenced, meaning wild animals can be found feeding on the areas waste. The dump is a few kilometers away from the town center and visiting tourists are completely oblivious of the effect their waste is having on local wildlife. The local town council is desperately underfunded meaning they cannot afford the expensive fence required to keep out the animals. Therefore the only viable solution is to have a publicly funded fence built by a charity. The issue is also being tackled by setting up a community run recycling project.  \n\nRecently, the devastating effect of this waste consumption has come to light with [eight elephants having died](http://i.imgur.com/I0Y7Q9ms.jpg) in the area, autopsies having revealing the cause of death to have been plastic blocking the digestive tract. Death from plastic consumption is extremely painful and drawn out, and one elephant was found with his trunk jammed down his own throat in a desperate attempt to remove plastic he had ingested. If this dumpsite remains uncontrolled, a reliance on the dump for food may spread between herds, resulting a loss of the local elephant population, as well as other species such as hyena,wildcat and baboons.\n\nWe aim to set up a self sustained solar electric fence surrounding the dumpsite. By keeping the animals out and the plastic in, this will help put an end to the needless loss of local wildlife. If you want to help fund this important project please visit [the Elefence crowdfunding page.](https://www.generosity.com/animal-pet-fundraising/the-victoria-falls-elefence) For updates on how much progress is being made please feel free to visit and share our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/VictoriaFallsElephantFence/).\n\nThanks /r/conservation, hopefully together we can save our wildlife from suffering!\n",
