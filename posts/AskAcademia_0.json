        "text": "How much do fulbright postdocs pay, and (beyond the prestige) is it worth it to go for one ? I’m thinking of applying (from Aus) in a couple of years after I graduate, but I’m wary that it’s only about a 4-10 month period over there for postdoc fellowships and I’d then have to face the jobs again when I get back. \n\nClearly there are benefits to applying as it might set me up for better longer term opportunities in my home country due to name recognition… but also…. the instability is a drawback, and if it’s only for a smallish stipend like the one I’m currently on (or like what’s offered to visiting Fulbright research students at PhD level, which is kind of the same amount of money as I am getting now) then that’s not much…. The website isn’t very clear on this stuff too. \n\nIn some ways that shorter time period is good for my field because my interest isn’t specifically about America but global stuff, so I guess it would be a good opportunity to learn new things there and integrate them into my work, but I don’t necessarily want to stick around in the USA for 3+ years. But then of course as I said I would have to face the job search again when I get back home, which isn’t fun or particularly stable. \n\nAlso wondering whether I should just skip this idea and go straight to a more permanent position in industry or academia afterwards (I am humanities field) in my home city instead of trying for this if it’s not worth it. Any thoughts or experiences of fulbright postdocs from international countries working  in the US etc would be helpful….",

The PhD program has an average graduation time of 5.5 years. Since I've already spent two years in grad school, I'm ineligible for most of those prestigious fellowships, which is what got me thinking that I should consider myself a second-year PhD student, in terms of research experience. If I am hoping to graduate from a fresh-start PhD in four years, that would give me six years in grad school total.\n\nCan I talk to prospective PIs about this? I haven't yet committed to the school, but I want to avoid getting sucked into a long project by being upfront and proactive about my graduation goals (since rotations aren't formal at this school). I'm just worried it might seem unprofessional of me and sour the relationship from the start by seeming like I'm not passionate about the research. Anyone here have experience with someone graduating from a PhD early? When do students typically set their graduation year, and is it informal with their PI, or is it a formal discussion that happens in front of the thesis committee in the last couple years? Most importantly, who's the person I should ask about getting real answers to my question from my school, instead of just on Reddit? I don't want to ask the wrong person and, again, ruin a professional relationship. This is in the US for reference.",

He is new to a lot of procedures and I have done some of them a couple of times in my undergrad. \n\nWhile I have done them, I don't feel comfortable instructing someone through the procedure just yet, therefore I find it is effective for me to go through the procedures alone. I am a slow learner and, I hate to use it as an excuse, but I do have (under-medicated due to shortages) ADHD. Once I feel comfortable instructing someone else, I'll be more than happy to go through it with them but I need a day or two to troubleshoot a procedure.    \n\n\nHowever, the undergrad student really wants to be there when I am there. At first, I said sure, let us work through it together but I started feeling extremely overwhelmed and confused. He started to get quite mocking at me when I would make a mistake (I said micro instead of milli, I apologized and meant the latter and he made a comment \"you know that makes a huge difference\") I regrouped and did it alone with much success and then the next day instructed him which has worked out really well for the both of us.    \n\n\nHowever, he has picked up that I am there quite often and gets upset because \"he wants to be there when I am there.\"   \n\n\n I have said, \"I will be glad to instruct you through X procedure, but I am rather busy with other work/didn't sleep well/need a break, could I get back to you when I get a coffee/day/end of this week after an exam?\"\n\nI am really not trying to leave him out of things, and I am appreciative of the help, but I am often working on stuff that I have to do alone. He does sit there and asks me what am I doing, what I am thinking about, and what steps I am going through, why I do this instead of that. While I am appreciative of his interest, I need full concentration and preferably silence. Sometimes I am using the space to study for a class and he does the same thing (inb4 someone asks why not library, honestly it is crowded and loud. Yeah I know, what is up with that, it's a freaking library)  \n\n\nSo please be gentle on this greenhorn grad student I have no idea. Yes, I know, welcome to teaching.",

        "text": "Hi all! As stated in the question, I am wondering how submitted papers are viewed by faculty search committees for assistant professor positions. After looking at many CVs, I find that their papers can be 'in progress', 'submitted' or 'under review', and  'accepted'. I guess 'accepted' would be the best-case scenario as the research is peer-reviewed and about to publish, but due to the nature of the research and publication process, I think most papers will be 'submitted' or 'under review'. 'In progress' seems tricky but hopefully, it gives an impression that the paper is nearly ready to submit to a journal. Sometimes, I also find 'revision under review', which I think should say more than 'submitted' as the paper has a chance to be accepted.\n\nI am in statistics, and recently, I came across an assistant professor saying they got 5 papers by the time they applied (2 years ago) but when I read their CV, their papers were published in 2022. So, intuitively, I think at the time they applied, most of the 5 papers must be 'submitted'. I imagine by when I am in the job market, my papers will be 'submitted' as well. Statistically speaking, it usually takes me 8 - 9 months to get one project done and another 2 months for writing. \n\nI would love to hear more from you all. I guess the focus of my question will be about assistant professor jobs. Honestly, I am also very interested in how 'in progress' are viewed by faculty search committees (and maybe other categories as well!). Thank you so much.",

I'm a 23 year old first generation college student, I graduated in May 2022 from Indiana University. I majored in History and Political Science(double major) and a minor in Philosophy with a 3.9 GPA. I was a member of the Honors Program during my time. I was debating about law school but it is really expensive, I don't have any family so I have to pay for all of my own expenses. I live in a small town so living expenses are low but so is the pay. Through a combination of scholarships and working full time in a warehouse for the four years I was at the university, I managed to avoid any debt upon graduation. I was thinking more about academics as a career. I'm a very strong writer and I've been told I'm a great public speaker, although I get really nervous speaking in front of people. I plan on moving to Bloomington in the summer or fall with two friends so we all can split expenses. I was hoping those of you who have made a living in academia might have some advice for me. It would be greatly appreciated as I do not have anyone to speak to with experience. Generally I'm just wondering some of the steps I should take, some of the hurdles I can expect, some of the things you wished you would've done earlier in your career etc.",

Or can I enter directly into a specific pharmaceutical field? What are all the fields available and how do I know exactly what I will be doing in each field? Can I alternatively search for specific research areas and choose one that I want?\n\nSecond, my main interest is biophysics and related quantitative life sciences.. I very well understand what biophysics is about and have a good understanding of research areas in the field and what the science will be like. Sadly, I can't say the same about my understanding of the paths of pharmaceutical sciences. The problem is that biophysics programs require from me more background knowledge that I have no history of learning, areas in physics and calculus. My question is are there programs/ research areas in pharmacy that are similar or related to quantitative life sciences that fit my undergraduate degree more? I have an idea that since in pharma we are now using biologics and antibody drugs, that I can find things related to biophysics and computational biology in these areas in pharmacy, I don't know what the reality is though and how to search for these stuff.",

Especially since a new mandatory criteria requires me to select a local NGO from the Sahel that could benefit from my research.\n\nSo I believe the next step is to find a specific EU climate-security nexus approach which can be linked to a (specific) climate-related issue in the Sahel? But I fail to do so, after reading so many documents and even made a table of different EU strategies, projects etc, but find it complex. Truth be told; the process becomes a bit overwhelming and I start to become really insecure about my ability to succeed.\n\nMy supervisor is unfortunately not helpful at all…in the last meeting he said that he did not read my research proposal and forgot about the subject. He said that I could start all over again or email an professors and see if they might help. I don’t want to give up….\n\nMy research proposal is approved, but I encounter so many issues with narrowing down the scope of my research I would really appreciate some guidance😊. I want to graduate and do this. . I would be forever grateful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDown I elaborated a bit on the research:\n\nSub-questions:\n\n1. How did climate change develop as a security issue on the EU agenda?\n2. What are the main EU responses to tackle climate related security risks in the Sahel region?\n3. To what extent is the current EU climate-security nexus approach in the Sahel effective?\n4. What role could the EU play in future climate responses in the Sahel?\n\nFrom what I understood, the EU’s policies related to the climate security in the Sahel can be categorized as follows:\n\nA) Development policy, Climate policies , Security policies, Peacebuilding and conflict prevention, and diplomacy\n\nSo overall, the EU climate-security nexus acknowledges the complex relationship between climate change and security risks in the Sahel and addresses these risks through a comprehensive approach that includes development, conflict prevention, humanitarian assistance and military support.\n\nMoreover the EU-climate-security nexus considers climate-related issues in the Sahel as followed:\n\nB) Drought and desertification, water scarcity, land degradation, migration, conflict.\n\nI compiled a list of interesting EU projects and policies, which I can eventually send too.",

Is it unethical to have ChatGPT to rewrite a sentence without grammatical errors? Initially we all thought yes, definitely! However, is it really that different from asking a smart friend from helping you and if it is unethical, then is it unethical to use Grammarly or ask a friend when stuck?\n\nCurious as to everyone's thoughts.",

I have around 8 months left of my funding now, and I have still quite some work to do before I feel confident to present my viva in front of the panel. Best case scenario is I could get it done by the end of this month.\n\nMy supervisor had insisted strongly that Ieave with an MPhil degree - which in my eyes is something I would regret for the rest of my life to give up my ambition of achieving a PhD. I read that there is a CRS extension which can give me 1 extra year only for writing up my final PhD thesis, but i am quite far away in terms of meeting my final project end goals to even write a thesis, so I need more time. I would 100% be happy to self fund myself for after the 8 months to do the work I should have done 1.5 years ago, but I am not sure if there is a legal law which puts a hard limit on how long a student can spend on their PhD. \n\nAny advice or experience would be incredibly helpful for me right now. Right now it feels like my time is running out, or close to running out, but I want to complete what I started 4 years ago.",

I am a pretty outgoing, talkative person in general. But any time I have to present anything in front of a group of people, I get choked up, start sweating, voice gets shaky, and my mind goes blank. If it just went as far as me being nervous, I wouldn't care. But I feel like the nervousness overtakes me and thus affects my speaking... like I find myself not even being able to explain the *simplest* concepts. You could ask me to give a talk on what 2+2 is and I would find a way to make it a disaster.\n\nEven for small presentations (e.g., presenting a slide show of my weekly research/some literature review for my research group of about 10 people, sitting down in a conference room, very casually) I find myself having this problem. Like I know I should NOT be intimidated by something that casual. I talk to these people in my lab all the time. I feel comfortable around them. But as soon as I feel as if I'm presenting something and all eyes are on me, my brain stops functioning properly.\n\nI know that public speaking is essentially the most common fear, and like I said before I really wouldn't care about being nervous if I could still perform to a good standard alongside the nerves.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this problem and been able to overcome it? For me it's not as simple as convincing myself \"it's not a big deal\", because I literally *know* it isn't but my brain won't accept that for some reason lol. The only thing I've found that kind of helps is rehearsing my presentations a million times beforehand so I can just do them on autopilot, but that gets pretty tiring, especially for smaller, more insignificant presentations.",

But after a long string of terrible jobs and just living life, it had become abundantly clear to me I need to get educated in order to not live in poverty and not be treated as absolutely disposable.

The math requirements are really intense (I have to get them taken care of before they even let me touch a computer) and I have been studying to get my CompTIA Security+, because my friend said they could help me get a cyber security job. I'm struggling in the math class and my brain is not retaining any of the information of my studying, it just turns into mush in my mind. Also I have watched videos on computer science degrees as an option and the idea of staring at a computer in an office doing computational work, sounds not really fulfilling. I have taken career tests that say I'm a social person, who should work with people or in the arts, but the majors associated with that do not provide security of any kind. I've considered journalism (because I'm good at writing persuasively and creatively) and psychology (honestly because I think it would also help me with my writing and I'm usually the therapist to the ones I care about), I've also considered film, because I would like to work in the arts. So my whole hang up is stick with the major I'm in and have it be ill fitted for me or change major with the possibility of never having security.",

I recently discovered that we happened to collect everything required to calculate this metric in a previous trial. I performed the secondary analysis and then handed the output to one of the medical students who works for me to write the manuscript as the first author. I am early-career associate faculty level, so I do still answer to a PI, who is convinced that this manuscript will not be accepted into a good journal because the med student 'only has a BS degree'. \n\nI completely disagree with this stance, as I don't think the degree of the first author should matter at all when submitting. Our PI is telling me that I need to swap places with the med student and be first author. The PI is opposed to me being a co-first author. I think it incredibly unethical to strip this student of their first author status after I (with approval at the time from the PI) told the student that they could be first author. Everything changed when my PI saw the results (which are very good) and heard which journal I intend to submit to (#1 journal in my field). Also for context, my PI and I just submitted our annual review of this med student which in length detailed how this student is the best med student researcher we have ever had. \n\nHas anyone ever heard of this before? I have always had whomever either did the experiments and/or wrote the manuscript be the first author (20+ publications), so I am feeling completely blind-sided here. In this situation, since it is a secondary analysis and I only had to write maybe 20 lines of SAS code, I thought this student who did the writing deserved first authorship. To be fair, I did edit the text. Also for context, my PI has a history of authorship decisions with questionable ethics IMO. Based in the U.S. if this matters.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Don't know how to reach out to them without being pushy, but the hiatus has impacted my project and could prevent me from getting published.  \n\n\nI've been working as an undergrad RA at this psychology lab for the past 2 years. To be quite honest, I grew dissatisfied with the work I was given and felt that my skills weren't utilized to the max (mostly inputting data and collecting articles), but stayed in the lab because I grew close to my PI and supervising grad student. They have been such supportive and amazing mentors and despite the work being boring, the conversations, lab environment, and connections have been worthwhile. There were always talks of me being able to conduct my own project, and in my second semester in the lab me and a fellow RA starting drafting up the initial stages of our project. The fellow RA left the lab the following year due to other reasons, and the project petered off. My work went back to collecting articles and menial data work. At the start of this year, I voiced my enthusiasm to begin this project with the new RA that joined the previous semester, and we set out on a plan to conduct data collection and survey administrations in time for the big symposium at the end of the semester. Everything was going well and on track, but then something happened in the lab.   \nEveryone has been vague about it, and it happened so suddenly. I remember the grad student getting news during our meeting, and she was tearing up while trying to keep it together. Our professor had to interject the meeting to help us finish our proposal. Our meetings are normally in-person, but this particular day it was made online. I could tell they were not feeling it, and didn't want to press what happened until they felt comfortable. All me and my fellow RA know is something happened to someone in the lab but we don't know who or what. In short, we have no idea what happened, but something bad that all meetings have been put on halt. The following day we reached out to the grad student and PI to check up on them and let them know we can touch base when they're ready. They responded as well as anyone in their situation would.  \nIt's been a month now, and the research project hasn't picked up. We needed to be approved by the PI after submitting the proposal, but that never happened despite our checking in with them. We don't want to be pushy, but I'm not really sure how to proceed in this kind of situation. I only have another year left of undergrad, and would really love to complete this project and get published. I feel really selfish for being so pushy and don't want to overstep. We're not even sure if we qualify for the symposium anymore, but just want some guidance on what one would do in such a situation. At the end of the day we are undergrad RA's, so a minuscule part of their lives in the grand scheme of things, and sometimes life just happens :(",

If I'm acting without integrity I'd like to change how I do things. It might be that I'm just overthinking.\n\nWhen I'm reviewing literature, I'll find an article wherein the author/s have made their own statements and paraphrased the work of others. I then take what they've said and paraphrase as appropriate. If they've cited someone else I'll go read that paper, at least diagonally, and cite the original paper. Sometimes I'll use \"as cited by\" if I can't find the original paper. What this means is that in my draft I'll have a number of statements that have been \"informed\" by the original paper directly or by what they've paraphrased (sometimes sequentially in a paragraph or two in my draft). I then repeat this process and double back over what I've written which, naturally, lends to a number of pieces of literature built in. Rinse and repeat to form a balanced argument.\n\nAll of this is done in my own writing with everything cited appropriately. By the time I've redrafted the section numerous times, parts have been moved, reparaphrased, condensed or explained further and so on. I also seek out further literature to support my point or to balance my weighing of evidence. \n\nIs this normal? Is it just how I write? Is this what most people do? Am I \"cheating\"? Do I just need to relax a bit?  This is all very much early stages of the dissertation. Any help much appreciated!",

It is accredited, which is great. But I'm concerned his expectations may be off and he might be risking good money (10s of thousands). He shared that he'd like to use this degree to move into higher ed administration in the next five years. He has no academic background, and I have found higher ed super competitive and favors PhDs. Even with a PhD, I've seen colleagues have to uproot their families just to get a foot in the door somewhere. Also, when I have worked in academic departments, it's the faculty members who design curricula. I'm just not seeing an easy path for him to get a quick (as little as two years) online non-PhD degree that will lead to an administrative position in higher ed. \n\nI think it's also important to mention that his current income is 6-figures in his current industry and supports a family.  \n\n\nAll that being said, my perspective is limited to my experience, so I don't want to jump to conclusions on this. The approach I'm considering is to encourage him to go to U websites, look at the people in the positions he's interested in the long term, and investigate their backgrounds. I have NO plan to say \"this is a bad idea\" or \"don't do this\" or put down his potential degree.   \n\n\nMy question - WIBTA, if I did this? I don't want to burst his bubble, and this is his life.

I find myself able to write beautiful, well-articulated and thoughtful texts to friends and comments on social media, but the minute I try to write anything related to my thesis, I find myself frozen and feel as if I have, as the oh-so-wise T. Swift says, \"nothing in my brain\". I have fallen into the dreaded blackhole of a never-ending search for better and more literature. \n\nI know I need to just start writing, but I can't remember how I used to do this in my previous academic life. MSWord is a no-go, I have tried scrivener, which was a mess too, but now I am even experiencing a block to trying to jot down key points down on paper. Can't even produce a simple mind-map/ concept map. It's like the minute something is thesis related, I just freeze-up. I end up reading more, or going back to my reading. Almost as if I can't let go of the words someone else has published once they are on paper. I used to be able to churn out writing, almost without thinking, but I have been stuck for so much of this degree. It is nothing short of depressing.\n\nThe paralysis is killing me and making me feel something of a failure. Ironically, I would quite like to consider an academic or writing career in the future. My previous experience and qualifications suggest I should be able to do this easy. This is kind of my last shot and I can't work in my field without this degree. Beyond that, I would feel even worse about myself if I gave up now.\n\nSo, I wondered, does anyone have any suggestions for writing 'as if' for social media to somehow trick my brain into writing a lot really quickly? \n\nThank you",

I currently work in a very \"practical\" research and writing-heavy role advising clients, and while I enjoy it, I know that my heart isn't set on working in this role for the rest of my career. I've considered an MBA, but I don't really think that any other industry path is something I'd truly be interested in doing either. \n\nDeep down, I've always been interested in people and organizational behavior. I volunteer at work to take on a lot of extra responsibilities/projects around culture building and people management, especially during the pandemic. The content I consume for fun (YouTube videos, books, etc.) is always centered around how people think, make decisions, and work together. To put it bluntly, I find how people behave to be really interesting. All of these things have definitely made me realize that maybe it's time to think about a PhD, but I don't know anyone who has a non-STEM PhD and am not sure if it's realistic for me to pursue one. I feel like I maybe have the makings of someone who could be an academic (I genuinely enjoy writing, reading, studying, and I've narrowed down my field of interest), but I've also been discouraged in the past from pursuing a PhD because I've never done research before, I hear that knowing how to code is a prerequisite, and have also been told by some PhD students that OB/behavioral research is seen as \"lesser\" because it's harder to measure/study.\n\nA couple of questions that I'd be curious about:\n\n1. Do I need to know exactly what I want to study before I apply for a PhD?\n2. Should I be discouraged from applying directly for a PhD if I don't have a masters or research experience?\n3. If I'm interested in a particular school's program, who should I talk to from that program to see if I'd be a good fit (faculty, current students, etc.)?\n4. Does practical experience actually help my application, especially if my research topics are based on the things I've seen working?\n5. What actually matters the most in applications? (between things like undergraduate stats, GRE scores, experience, intent)\n6. Is a research fellowship a better idea (e.g., Stanford GSB Fellows)? Is there a list of business-based research fellowships floating around somewhere?\n7. Do I need to already have taken statistics/econometrics/computer science courses in undergrad/prior to starting the program? I didn't take any of these in undergrad. :(\n8. How much coding would I need to learn how to do for research purposes?\n\nThank you!!",

        "text": "I'm posting this on behalf of my gf. She's the recipient of a fellowship that covers most of her income. The fellowship covers a bit below the university minimum pay scale for her position such that the PI has to pay the difference (around $10k per year). Since her PI does not have to pay the majority of her salary now and since she will soon be the only lab member, she asked if she could receive half of of her current salary in addition to the fellowship that she brought in. (Had she not received the fellowship, she would still be employed because she's an amazing scientist and the PI would have to covered her salary 100%). Her PI begrudgingly accepted, but her department HR overruled on the matter, saying she can at most receive the minimum salary for a position plus a small bonus in the order of several thousand dollars. They say this is the department rule since everyone in her position earns this amount. Pervading the concept of \"egalitarianism\" to set an artificial maximum on salary is disgusting and reminds me of antitrust. My gf and I eventually plan to have kids. If she becomes pregnant and then a mother, the fellowship actually pays an extra stipend to support women in academia during their pregnancy and motherhood. This means that while she's pregnant and enters into motherhood, her salary will still be limited by her department rules, and that extra stipend will go straight to her PI. How is this legal? Someone please explain to me how on earth this is legal.\n\nShe's a postdoc in biology in the US.",

        "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI'm a master's student and am writing my thesis this semester/summer. I'm struggling keeping everything organized as I write my literature review. I have dozens of articles downloaded or pulled up on a bunch of tabs on my computer browser. It's really overwhelming to keep track of which article contains what and have them all easily accessible without a bunch of tabs cluttering my computer/brain. Does anyone have any tips? I have an annotated bibliography started to try to keep track of my citations and summaries of each article, but it doesn't seem comprehensive enough.",

When I marry, I will be taking my husbands surname as I personally hate my current surname — my dad is the only one in my family who bears this name, meaning there's little family relevance in my name, and I hate my dad. \n\nWhat would everyone's advice be? Would it be acceptable to change?",
