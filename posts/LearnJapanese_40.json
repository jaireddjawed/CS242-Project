        "author": "fongor",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/ynm1k7/am_i_understanding_のはのがのをことcorrectly/",
        "text": "So this is what I understand from what I read so far:\n\n- のは is when you mention an action, object etc, among other ones that could also be mentioned but are just not: 漢字を読むのは難しい, you don't mention katakana nor hiragana, but they also exist and could be mentioned, so maybe they are also difficult, maybe not. In your sentence, you just focus on kanji among other things. \n\n- のを is to mention something, through a noun that would require を in an other sentence (ラメんを食べる), or through an action performed and mentioned with a verb using を (何かをする), but that doesn't imply that there are other related points of focus that you could also mention about the topic you're talking about. \n\nYou were supposed to cook ramen, not anything more: ラメんを作るのを忘れた。\n\n- Finally, のが is a bit like the most common way of using が in a sentence without の, meaning you mention something among other things, not because \"you just don't mention the other things\", but because you \"elect\" this particular thing: you choose to say that the interesting / beautiful / strange / etc thing, is not the other things that you could mention, but this one specifically. You don't like beer, wine, whisky, shouchu, there is only one alcool worth interest to you: 日本酒が美味しいです。\n\nAnd then, there is the specific case of 好き/ 嫌い, with which you always use のが like you do in sentences without の：漫画が好き、漫画を読むのが好き。\n\nOk. \n\nSo first, are these distinctions correct? \n\nAnd second, there is the \"の+other particle\" form versus the \"Verb+こと\" form. \n\nAfter reading many examples, the impression I have beyond specific cases is that the nuance would be something like this:\n\n1) First, 何かすること is mentioning an activity that appears in a sentence where there is no nuance of \"electing\" this activity among others, because in that case case you would use のが.\n\nA: 私の趣味は、映画を見ることです。\nB: え、本当？私は音楽を聞くのが楽しいと思います。\n\n(I purposely didn't use 好き in B's answer, because we already know that 好き goes with が).\n\nSo here, when A is talking, he doesn't oppose movies to something else, he just talks \"on a blank page\" about his hobby, and well, his hobby is eiga.\n\nBut when B answers, he opposes ongaku to eiga, hence the が, that \"elects\" ongaku over eiga. \n\nAnd 2), it feels to me that the nuance between Verb + の(は、を、が） and Verb + こと is that:\n\nFirst, Verb + こと takes the activity as a whole, like a noun that you can not divide into sub-pieces of meaning: 何かをすること is a whole in itself. \n\nFor instance, 音楽を聞くこと transforms \"listening to music\", that is one verb + one object, into \"the musiclistening\". An activity as whole, not dividable. \n\nThis is not the actual translation you would use, but it would be the idea. \n\nAnd the other point would be that, at this very moment, you mention this activity as some sort of \"abstraction\", in the sense that in your sentence, there is no mention of an actualization of this activity. \n\nWhen saying 映画を見ること, you're not talking about seeing a movie yesterday, today, tomorrow, you don't even talk about you particularly seeing movies, you talk about \"the fact of watching movies\". \n\nWhat I call abstraction is not opposed to something concrete in its meaning, as watching a movie is a concrete activity, I use it to oppose it to an actualized activity. \n\nActualized doesn't necessarily mean actualized in the very moment you speak (to be doing something now), but it means an activity that is referred to, in this very sentence, not as taking place in some point of time and space, but as almost \"theoretical\", like, \"you're just talking (about this activity)\". Like you would talk about cats or dinosaurs, you're not referring to a cat or a dinosaur you have personally met, you just talk about the _species_ \"dinosaurs\" or the _species_ \"cats\". \n\nAn example to get my distinction would be in English: \n\n\"Walking my dog is fun\", you are referring to yourself personally watching your own dog Toby. \n\n\"Walking a dog is fun\", you are referring to the abstract, or if you prefer, the \"general\" - maybe a better wording - activity of walking a dog. \n\n\"I like walking my dog\": you would use が, because walking a dog is actualized in the personal subject that you are, and because walking refers to a concrete subject, your dog. Whether you are doing it now or not. \n\n\"I like walking a dog\": whatever the dog doesn't matter, you are just referring to the general activity of \"walking a dog\", so you would use こと.\n\nIn our example above, if you say you like watching movies, it's not depending on a certain movie, you like the activity _generally speaking_, as a whole, the Watchingmovies activity. Hence 見ること。\n\nWhich could also explain, for instance, why you always use の when following the activity with verbs like 見る、聞く、待つ、手伝う、やめる… \"I _see_ or _can see_ Tanaka san playing tennis\", by definition this sentence includes an actualized version of the tennis playing activity. \n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nI'm sure there are many things in this that need to be corrected, but at least am I widely on the right track?\n\nOf course any correction or refinement will be more than welcome, as I'm trying to understand this correctly :)\n\nThanik you very much in advance!",

        "text": "I started self-studying Japanese (again) two weeks ago because my school offers a Japanese course. I found Genki I and II textbook pdf online as well as their workbook and did two lessons. \n\nYesterday I had my first Japanese class at school and my teacher told us to buy みんなの日本語. She brought the main textbook. I flipped through it and was quite skeptical... I showed her Genki and asked her if it was okay to use this. But then I did some research about both books and how people use them and came to this conclusion :\n\nTo be honest, I don't even like Genki that much. Too many English explanations, too many peer exercises (I have no one to practice with), and almost no immersion. It is still a great book I learned so much from it. I watched tons of videos about みんなの日本語 and chose to go for it for this one and only reason, it has no English (and I don’t need the English translation book because I have a teacher). Also found great resources online like にほんごハウス (makes great みんなの日本語 videos in Japanese) and NihonGoal (who has a great free course on the book as well as kanji and vocabs) on youtube.\n\nI also started learning みんなの日本語 vocabs and kanji and made memrise courses with audio.\n\n(I bought the main textbook yesterday and will be buying the workbook in a week)",

It really seems made for English speakers to teach other English speakers. \n\nSo I was wondering what the community’s opinion on other textbooks might be for post-Genki 2. Maybe something that would be easier for my teacher?

        "text": "本音 and 建前 are a useful contrast in Japanese to compare what someone really thinks to the public face shown to others. A common example is the politeness expected from customer service. In Japan, there is a saying \"御客様は神様です\", or the customer is God. As a result, the customer must be addressed using 敬語 (honorifics). But this is all 建前; in many cases, the server may think poorly of the customer but must be polite regardless.\n\nTake the example of an IT support worker for example. If he is called out to examine a computer and discovers it's not plugged in, he may think \"このクソボケ! なんてもったいない事をするんだよ!\" (This dumb shit! What a waste of time!) But saying this to the customer would obviously be grossly inappropriate. So instead of the harsh 本音 judgement, we get the 建前 of \"お役に立てて嬉しいです。\" (Glad to be of service). So the 和 (harmony) is preserved, and no one gets sacked for swearing at customers. After a few drinks at the 居酒屋, dropping formalities is much more acceptable.",

I want to spend it learning Japanese, eating lots of food, and kind of just be immersed in a different culture after such a long period of staying at home. I am a newbie at Japanese, but hopefully my Chinese and English will help a little bit with memorizing vocab. \n\nMy ideal vacation was to spend the morning/noon taking Japanese lessons and the afternoon wandering around Tokyo. However, after doing some research, I found out that most Japanese classes are planned for months or years at a time, and for those that are short term, they start at specific dates and the schools close in December. So now I'm not sure how to make the most of my trip. Does anyone know of Japanese classes that I can join in December, or suggestions for efficient self-learning while getting conversation practice?\n\nAlso, if anyone has cool bucket list items for Tokyo or day trips nearby, let me know :) Thanks so much in advance!",

I lacked a certain structure to my learning efforts so I decided I change my strategy and restructure my learning to give it more focus.\n\nI already used immersion for learning, but I when I learned about refold I think I did that a bit too early.  \nRefold tells my I should at least know 1000 words and be able to read. But I suppose Japanese is a different case. It's impossible as a beginner to get acquainted with all the kanjis and be able to read from early stages, unlike other languages, like spanish.\n\nSo my question to you is: When is a good point to stop with the basics and actually get into immersion? I realized I still need to know many thinks like adjectives, get my head around particles and the like. Still too early you say?",

I mean, there is a lot of grammar that I see for the first time, so there is a lot of looking up (At the very least, vocabulary/kanji, that is very simple and quick to check, so no issue there)  \n\n\nBut here is the worry, and anxiety  \nI constantly see people saying that, reading too advanced material is a really bad idea, and won't help at all... And so, here is the worry, should I go for boring, but simpler material, or keep at what I am doing, a.ka, reading books I adore, not caring about efficiency  \n(Like... If I don't understand some sentence, as in, it is incomprehensible, I check english version of the book. And I get more feel of how things work, alongside checking grammar points and such. And if I still can't comprehend, I put sentence in notes, to ask about later, people more experienced than me. But that happens quite sparsely.)  \n\n\nSo yeah... Anyhow, I appreciate any input, thank you, and I apologize for being silly, and worrying about irrational, silly.. things.",

My last name is Litvin; my family is from Ukraine, so my actual last name is Литвин (Lytvyn), the main difference being that the \"i\" is much closer to イ in Ukrainian, and the v is subtler than English. The default way of converting my English name seems to be リトビン.  \n\n\n\\*Also, sorry if this is a bit of a wordy mess and seems very overthought. (It definitely is.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe \"トビ\" in \"リトビン\" is not very close to Li***tvi***n, because of the お vowel sound. To get it to the more subtle う vowel sound, I can either use トゥ or ツ. Japanese, of course, also doesn't have an equivalent to the \"v\" sound in Litvin, so I am considering pretending the v isn't there, switching the \"ビン\" to \"イン.\"\n\nCrap, this doesn't matter, does it? Please help lol\n\n The reason I don't necessarily want \"リトビン\" is because it sounds a little clunky to pronounce and inaccurate. This bothers me since it's such a common practice for people to refer to you by only your last name in Japan. The main objective of this post is to get opinions from proficient or native speakers on which of these options seems natural to pronounce and truest to my name as it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n With that all in mind, the alternative \"spellings\" could be \n\n1)リツビン, 2)リトゥビン, 3)リツイン, 4)リトゥイン\n\nYou could also divide this into two questions: \n\nA) Should I change the \"t\", and if so, to ツ or トゥ  \nB) Should I neglect the \"v\" sound, changing ビン to イン  \n\n\n話し合うてください！",

After some time reping every day for multiple hours and following the same routine (writing down 8 new Kanji, repeating the already learned Kanji, and learning 6 new words/sentences with the JLPT N5 Tango deck) I really notice that learning vocabulary has become more easy for me. I start to recognize patterns, build mnemonics around the words or kanji and so on and so forth. \n\nWhen I started I took around 2-4 hours for 12 new words/sentences and repeating the existing ones (which is around 30 most of the time but sometimes went up to 40-50). After a couple of days or a week I recognized that 12 new words/sentences a day was just too much for my brain and that I had to lower it. I went down to 8 and then down to 6 which is quite alright in my opinion because I now learn the words that I have to every day with more thought and don't have to stress myself about 40-50 cards (which was just too much for me).\n\nEven if I'm just starting learning Japanese this is meant be a quick motivator for all the guys like me who thought of giving up before they even started. I think the more you learn the easier it will get. Or at least I hope so.\n\nI plan on going to Japan for 3 months next year so I have to learn as much as possible until then. And hopefully I will learn much faster when I'm there. It's such an interesting language and such a great challenge but I don't plan on giving up!\n\nThanks for reading :)",

More than enough to show proof of ownership and get the Anki decks from u/Nukemarine. It's cheaper than buying the physical books (Which is what I did at first to show proof of ownership, but subsequently, sold them on eBay and used the money to buy the digital Amazon Kindle versions off of the Japanese Amazon website).\n\nAnyways, I thank you all for your input and take on what to tackle next.",

        "text": "Beginners always think that the more complicated a kanji is, the harder it is to remember, when in fact, 1) it's unrelated, and 2) it actually makes it easier by being more special and standing out more.\n\nWhether it's 一 or 鬱, they are both normal kanji... but you know what separates them in difficulty? Their readings. Kanji that you could consider hard either got a lot of them or they're really long and therefore harder to remember.\n\nThe most basic and simple kanji usually have a lot readings, including 熟字訓's (Jukujikun - a word that uses kanji to depict the meaning but not the reading). \n\nThat's why you could say that 日 is actually one of the hardest kanji out there. It's got a lot of readings (日 (ひ)、一日 (いちにち)、曜日 (ようび)、先日 (せんじつ), and it's used in a lot of Jukujikun (今日 (きょう), 明日 (あした, あす)、昨日 (きのう)、一日 (ついたち). **{Note: 一日 as いちにち means 1 day time, while ついたち means the 1st day of the month}**\n\nKanji that have really long readings however are generally on a higher level of difficulty; those include: 司る (つかさどる)、志 (こころざし)、覆す (くつがえす)、嘴 (くちばし), 慮る (おもんぱかる), 翻す (ひるがえす).\n\n#EXTRA\n\nThere's also a lot of \"meme\" words commonly used in literature that people might consider harder to read because they're basically just huge squiggles (魑魅魍魎 (ちみもうりょう)、朦朧 (もうろう)、鸚鵡返し (おうむがえし) but it goes back to point 1, they stand out more and at the end of the day they're still normal kanji with normal readings, why would MOUROU as a reading be harder to remember than something like GAKKOU? I guess you could say that 学校 is more common and seen almost daily, but out of the thousands of kanji and tens of thousands of words that exist in japanese you're not going to come across every single one of them on a daily basis, but after a while, they still stick. :)\n\nTL;DR: The title",

This patch allows lookups on formatted words (e.g. with color) and fixes a couple other problems that led to false negative dictionary lookups.  https://github.com/weirdalsuperfan/nhk-pronunciation/archive/patch-1.zip\n\nIt's not perfect (e.g. cases of multiple readings and 漢字 compounds like 一日中 can give results for 一 and 日 separately), but it seems like the real maintainer has gone MIA, so my branch has been the \"real\" branch for the past few months. If this plugin ever annoyed you to death, feel free to give my patch a try.",

        "text": "Hey!\n\nSo I have made it to about half way through Genki 2 and I have only recently started playing with the accompanied CD's. I feel like I may have neglected this additional feature, which in turn has probably hindered my listening comprehension. \n\nI'm wondering what your guys favourite method of using these CD's are? Do you close your eyes and listen and try to understand it all or do you perhaps read along while listening. I'd love to hear what is best recommended. \n\nMy next point I would like to ask for advice on is how to improve my recall ability. For example, I am able to read all of the reading practice exercises in Genki and understand all of what is said. However, if someone asked me to write something of equal quality, I don't think I would be able to. I already use anki to help me learn vocabulary, but when it comes to actively recalling it, I don't feel like I can remember it as easily without seeing it written in front of me.\n\n I think this equally translates into spoken language for me. Luckily I am fortunate enough to already live in Japan and I have regular conversations with Japanese people (most of which speak English) but it's very short sentences. I don't know how to expand upon the small conversations I have so that I can recall a story or describe what I am thinking to the same standard that I am able to read in the Genki reading exercises. \n\nMy current method of improving my speaking ability, is once I have learned a new grammar point I try to force it into a conversational situation. For example, when I learned -ことがある in Genki 1 I would constantly ask people if they had certain experiences, which made it stick in my head. With Genki 2 however, I feel like I am unable to do the same as easily. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to push myself to the next level of conversational ability? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",
